Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the expired group compared to survivors.

These findings could be explained by the fact that the presence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea leads to dehydration (due to poor oral intake and fluid loss) with its detrimental effects. The duration of symptoms before hospitalization, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation and hospital stay in our studied patients were statistically significantly prolonged in the expired group compared to the survivors. Also, there was a statistically significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation (r = 0.681) between mortality and prolonged duration of illness before hospitalization. Other investigators found similar results [5] [6] [7] [8] . These results can be explained by a delay in diagnosis and management of corona infected patients' result in deterioration in their health status with more need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, increased total hospital stay and poor outcome. Also, Al-Tawfiq et al. [9] found that corona patients in comparison with controls were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (53% vs 20%; OR, 4.65; P = .025) and to have a high mortality rate (76% vs 15%; OR, 18.96; P < 0.001).",

Non smoking and ex smoking were statistically significantly (P < 0.01) higher among the survivors in comparison with the expired group. Also, there was statistically (P < 0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r = 0.640). These results are in agreement with previous data that showed that smoking is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality in respiratory tract infection, especially in populations that smoke heavily [6] [7] [8] . Cigarette smoking is associated with a variety of alterations in cellular and humoral immune system functions. These alterations include a decreased level of circulating immunoglobulins, a depression of antibody responses to certain antigens, a decrease in CD4+ lymphocyte counts, an increase in CD8+ lymphocyte counts, depressed phagocyte activity and a decreased release of pro inflammatory cytokines. [17] . Smoking increases CD8+ lymphocytes in the cell mediated system and suppresses the host defense against infections [18] .",

Several studies indicate that morbid obesity may be an independent risk factor for complications and mortality from MERS corona virus infection [6] [7] [8] [9] . There are some explanations for these results. Obesity can impede pulmonary function (reduced functional residual capacity and expiratory volume). A subsequent ventilation-perfusion abnormality may decrease ventilatory reserve and predispose the obese to respiratory failure after even mild pulmonary challenges [19, 20] . Obstructive sleep apnea is present in 40% of obese persons and is associated with systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale [21, 22] . Obese persons are at an increased risk of developing pulmonary emboli and aspiration pneumonia. Morbid obesity is associated with complications in the intensive care unit including prolonged stay, prolonged ventilation and death [23, 24] . In addition to its effects on pulmonary function, obesity is frequently, but not always associated with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease and high overall mortality [20] .",

There was a statistically (P < 0.05) positive correla-tion between the number of associated co-morbidities and mortality (r = 0.735). Our results are in accordance with other workers' results [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Also, Arabi et al. [25] concluded that people with DM, renal failure, and chronic lung disease and immuno-compromised persons are considered to be at a high risk of severe disease from MERS CoV infection. Also, our results are in agreement with previous data showing that patients who are immuno-compromised as a result of chronic diseases, malignancy, receiving treatment related to solid organ transplants and DM are at a high risk of respiratory tract infection-related complications including mortality [26, 27] . Immuno-compromised patients have an increased attention because of the documentation of prolonged viral shedding in critically ill patients, with the subsequent emergence of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitor drugs [28] . Renal failure population has many factors such as overwhelming uremia, neutrophil dysfunction, malnutrition, trace elements' deficiencies, iron overload, impaired glucose metabolism, and hyperparathyroidism, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs to treat and control underlying diseases leads to increased morbidity and mortality of infection [29] . Casqueiro et al. [30] concluded that the infectious diseases are more frequent and/or serious in patients with DM, which potentially increases their morbidity and mortality due to many factors as a deficiency of the C4 component in DM, this reduction of C4 is probably associated with polymorphonuclear dysfunction and reduced cytokine response decrease secretion of inflammatory cytokines as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 decreased mobilization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, chemotaxis and phagocytic activity. CD4 T-lymphocytes and their response to antigens are impaired.",
