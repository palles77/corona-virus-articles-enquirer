            "text": "Abstract Studying membrane active peptides or protein fragments within the lipid bilayer environment is particularly challenging in the case of synthetically modified, labeled, artificial, or recently discovered native structures. For such samples the localization and orientation of the molecular species or probe within the lipid bilayer environment is the focus of research prior to an evaluation of their dynamic or mechanistic behavior. X-ray scattering is a powerful method to study peptide/lipid interactions in the fluid, fully hydrated state of a lipid bilayer. For one, the lipid response can be revealed by observing membrane thickening and thinning as well as packing in the membrane plane; at the same time, the distinct positions of peptide moieties within lipid membranes can be elucidated at resolutions of up to several angstroms by applying heavy-atom labeling techniques. In this study, we describe a generally applicable X-ray scattering approach that provides robust and quantitative information about peptide insertion and localization as well as peptide/lipid interaction within highly oriented, hydrated multilamellar membrane stacks. To this end, we have studied an artificial, designed b-helical peptide motif in its homodimeric and hairpin variants adopting different states of oligomerization. These peptide lipid complexes were analyzed by grazing incidence diffraction (GID) to monitor changes in the lateral lipid packing and ordering. In addition, we have applied anomalous reflectivity using synchrotron radiation as well as in-house X-ray reflectivity in combination with iodine-labeling in order to determine the electron density distribution q(z) along the membrane normal (z axis), and thereby reveal the hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as the position of certain amino acid side chains within the lipid bilayer. In the case of multiple labeling, the latter technique is not only applicable to demonstrate the peptide's reconstitution but also to generate evidence about the relative peptide orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer.",

Compared to protein complexes, membrane active peptides present relative structural simplicity and are frequently used to validate experimental approaches, techniques, and applications (Bechinger 2001; He et al. 1993) . With the presented study, we are interested in evaluating the biophysical properties of a recently published motif of straightforward designed, aromatic, b-type polypeptides. This includes analysis of peptide positioning, orientation, and changes in bilayer thickness as well as the effect of peptide reconstitution on lateral lipid packing and ordering. Furthermore, we want to introduce a general and applicable X-ray-based approach that provides combined access to significant and quantitative parameters of peptide/lipid interaction on a molecular scale within the physiological membrane state. In this way, structural information, both in the bilayer plane and along the normal direction, can be determined.",

Some of these techniques require membrane states or parameters that are far from physiologically or biologically relevant. In addition, sample preparation for some applications, e.g., frozen state samples for EPR spectroscopy, are often prone to uncertainties and artifacts. Therefore, the sample preparation method itself has to be carefully evaluated, usually with significant effort.",

However, in recent years the potential of X-ray scattering methods in probing peptide/lipid complexes, i.e., the membrane as well as the peptide structure, has been shown to be almost solely limited by the nonuniformity or patchiness of the peptide/lipid system itself (Qian et al. 2008; Salditt et al. 2006) . Therefore, if samples of suitable quality can be obtained, the potential of a simultaneous analysis at the molecular scale of the incorporated peptide species, the surrounding lipid matrix, and the peptide/lipid interactions underlines the power of this analytical method. In addition, X-ray scattering is compatible with the fluid membrane state and capable of providing information for both dimensions of the lipid bilayer space.",

The central width of this distribution is called mosaicity. A narrow distribution or equivalently small mosaicity allows for a precise distinction between the scattering vector components, vertical (q z ) and parallel (q k ) to the lipid bilayer. Thereby, the multilamellar state of the samples, which can be almost fully hydrated by controlled relative humidity (Aeffner et al. 2009 ), provides a tremendous amplification of the scattering signal compared to single bilayer preparations. However, compared to single bilayer reflectivity, the multilamellar stacks usually impede the determination of the electron density q(z) on an absolute scale, unless a full q-range fit of the electron density is performed (Constantin et al. 2003) .",

The specular peaks are accompanied by diffuse scattering in the form of so-called Bragg sheets extending along q k . This scattering contribution can be assigned to lateral inhomogeneities at mesoscopic length scales (nanometers to a few micrometers) due to membrane fluctuations-always present in the fluid/ hydrated state-and peptide insertions causing local orientational disorders (Fig. 1ii) , which break the lateral translation invariance.",

In addition, the conformation of the reconstituted peptide's structure can in some cases be deduced from the low q k signal of molecular form factors, the so-called helix maximum (Fig. 1vii) , or from helix peaks revealing intrahelical distances at high q k (not shown) as it has been revealed for the regularly organized and conformationally constrained alamethicin single helix (Spaar and Salditt 2003) .",

This goal was fulfilled through the synthesis of the peptide hairpin 2 (Fig. 2c , iv) allowing for further studies that address peptide oligomerization within lipid model membrane complexes. The helix assembly is, thereby, driven by molecular recognition of the peptide nucleic acid (PNA) moieties at the membrane's exterior (Fig. 2c, v-vi; .

In the respective studies, parameters such as the sample composition, the relative humidity (RH), and the peptide-to-lipid (P/L) ratio are varied. The obtained results can be explained by a qualitative model that predominantly takes into account a hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as a lateral packing and ordering of the annular lipid shell that is correlated to the extent of peptide-lipid contact surface. Furthermore, we analyze the differentially (double) iodine-labeled hairpin species of type 2 via anomalous and in-house reflectivity elucidating their positioning with respect to the membrane normal (z axis) and confirming their transmembrane orientation.

Therefore, no automated absorbers could be used during reflectivity or offset scans; absorbers had to be calibrated in advance of data collection.

Both f 0 and f 00 , connected by the Kramers-Kronig relations, strongly vary in the vicinity of an absorption edge and can be measured (f 00 ) or obtained from databases. At an absorption edge the absolute values of f 0 and f 00 are the highest with respect to nonresonant energy regions, where f & f 0 . Thus, in a resonant diffraction experiment it is very important to determine the energy value of the absorption edge accurately to a resolution of about 1 eV. It is known that the scattering factors f 0 and f 00 of a chemical species within a sample, here iodine, depend very sensitively on its environment. Since there are many influences on these values, their accurate calculation by theoretical consideration is not feasible. Therefore, it is the most reliable strategy to measure f 00 and calculate f 0 during the experimental setup (Als-Nielsen and McMorow 2001). Experimentally, it is possible to access f 00 by absorption or fluorescence measurements.

Instead of measuring f 00 and calculating f 0 the distinct iodine L III edge was found by varying the beam energy about \u00b10.025 keV around the tabulated L III edge by means of modulating the undulator gap and detecting the absorption. The iodine L III edge was found at E = 4.5578 keV.

Upon reducing the water content of the system, the fraction of gauche bonds within the lipid acyl chains is diminished and leads to lipid chain stretching. As a consequence, the lipid chain alignment and ordering (Cevc and Marsh 1985) as well as a lateral compression or packing (Bryant et al. 2001; Chen and Hung 1996) are enhanced. Such behavior was confirmed by the results obtained from measurements for samples 5-9. In line with the literature, a lowering of the acyl chain distance of about Da max = 0.097 \u00b1 0.006 \u00c5 and an increase in the correlation length of Dn max = 0.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00c5 were observed when comparing the results for RH = 94% to RH = 25% and to RH = 60%, respectively. The revealed effect that at low water content with RHs between 40 and 25%, the correlation length n seems to reach saturation and even slightly decreases for sample 9, can be associated with the steric demands exerted by the peptide and cholesterol inclusions (Fig. 5b) . Steric demands of the relatively rigid peptide helices become more critical in the more condensed phases than in the fluid phase (Mar\u010delja 1974) . This condition of so-called intermediate fluidity (Oldfield and Chapman 1972) describes the fact that the interaction between inclusions such as cholesterol or peptides cannot be as strong as interactions among ordered all-trans lipid chains (Mar\u010delja 1974 ). We did not observe the phenomenon of an interchain hydration at high RH that is concomitant with an increased lipid chain-chain distance and results from defect structures caused by inserted peptides (Ho et al. 1995) .",

One may initially expect the opposite effect, i.e., an increase in a and a decrease in n. This could appear conclusive, since the occupation of the lipid bilayer area by peptide inclusions would lead to additional and longer trans-helix chain-chain distances for so-called annular lipids, which are in direct contact with the peptide helix. Furthermore, the absent chain-chain correlation between those lipids could reduce n. From the experimental results it is obvious that this is not the case, or at least other phenomena are outweighing such assumed effects leading to an increase in lipid packing (density) and chain ordering.",

The intensity profiles (Fig. 4b) at a certain constant / were fitted to Lorentzian lineshapes (Eq. 2). The resulting fits at / = 8\u00b0(a) were applied to calculate the mean lipid acyl chain distance a and the acyl chain correlation length n (b) Already in early work, motivated by fluorescence data, a distinction is made between lipids not in contact with protein or peptide surface and lipids 'coupled' to the reconstituted protein, which are, thereby, disturbed in their interaction (Tr\u00e4uble and Overath 1973) . These so-called annular lipids were shown not to undergo lipid phase transitions. The postulated protein-derived disturbance was calculated to extend up to the third lipid neighbor of a protein inclusion (Mar\u010delja 1976) . Addressing the structure of annular lipids in greater detail by theoretical molecular field approximations revealed an increased ordering of the lipid chains in proximity to membrane-incorporated structures within the fluid lipid phase (Mar\u010delja 1974) . With increasing fraction of ''foreign molecules'' on the phospholipid bilayer, the membrane order parameter was reported to increase and the dependency of the order parameter on temperature to become less pronounced. We will denote this scenario as the (annular) lipid ordering scenario. In the lipid condensed phase, this effect was described to be the opposite, which we denote as the lipid disordering scenario. Other authors claim that rigid inclusions such as cholesterol might cause straightening and ordering of lipid chains, while the fluid-like surface of embedded proteins does not influence the motional freedom of the lipid chains (Lafleur et al. 1990a) . Molecular dynamics simulations of three different peptide a helices, published at the same time, likewise revealed an ordering of the lipid chains close to the peptide helices for all peptide species (Edholm and Johansson 1987) . Even if the overall effect was assessed as ''not drastic,'' the annular lipid ordering could be estimated as ''much less pronounced'' for lipids with bulky side chains. More recent theoretical considerations applying statistical mechanical integral equation theories (Lag\u00fce et al. 1998 ) predict an expansion of the area per lipid for the annular shell upon peptide insertion into different phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers. In these studies, peptides are treated as soft cylinders (Lag\u00fce et al. 2001 ). The authors postulate effective long range repulsion between lipids and peptides due to the formation of a lipid depletion layer around a protein leading to an increased cross-sectional area per lipid molecule. According to this view, which also supports the lipid disordering scenario for annular lipids, a lipid molecule in close contact with the peptide must significantly reduce its order. Effective lipid-protein repulsion would arise due to its entropic disadvantage. These theoretical results were further supported by MD simulations of a hydrated 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhyPC) bilayer containing an a-helical peptide bundle of four transmembrane domains (Husslein et al. 1998 ). Comparable to the results of Lag\u00fce et al., Husslein and coworkers revealed an increase in the area per lipid from 7.46 nm 2 for the unperturbed bilayer to 8.50 nm 2 in the vicinity of the peptide species. Finally, for the sake of completeness, we note that a pronounced annular lipid effect is not reported by all studies. Using spin labeling techniques, Marsh and Horv\u00e1th found order parameters of protein-associated lipid chains to be very similar to those in the bulk liquid-crystalline phase regions (Marsh and Horv\u00e1th 1998) . Considering these opposing scenarios, it is interesting that we observed a very clear indication of the lipid ordering scenario. The decrease in the average lipid chain distance a as well as an increase in the lipid chain correlation length n for the peptides studied here can be ascribed to a reduced number of lipid gauche rotamers (Fig. 6) . For different molecular systems imposing different molecular boundary conditions, the second scenario could be valid instead. It should be taken into consideration that for the sake of simplicity, the theories supporting either one of the scenarios neglect the individual chemical properties of the incorporated molecular species that are the bases for interaction at the peptide/lipid interface.",

These effects may be attributed to the specific properties of the peptide species, i.e., their sequences, side-chain orientations, and secondary structures Eur Biophys J (2011) 40:417-436 427 acids (Chiu et al. 1999 ). This should be particularly pronounced in the case of tryptophan-containing peptides, such as species 1-9, as tryptophan is known as an amino acid with high preference for lateral interaction (Adamian and Liang 2001; Ridder et al. 2005) . The planarity and hydrophobicity/amphipathicity of the aromatic side chains have already been shown to provide potential for a perfect alignment and interaction with the lipid bilayer core via intercalation between the lipid chains (Hite et al. 2008; Palsdottir and Hunte 2004) . Hydrophobic interaction might further direct lipid chains to approach closer contact to incorporated peptide species via lowering entropic costs for acyl chain deformation. This lipid/peptide interaction might play a predominant role for b-helical peptide species due to the fact that all peptide side chains are pinpointing radiantly outside the helix . Proper vertical alignment for the reconstituted peptide in the bilayer was concluded already in a previous reflectivity study exhibiting up to six lamellar orders nearly independent of the applied peptide concentration (K\u00fcsel et al. 2007 ).",

Namely, the effects of hydrophobic matching and interfacial anchoring (Killian and Nyholm 2006) interfere with the lateral forces. Hydrophobic matching and interfacial anchoring are especially important for the presented peptide species, as all of them hold two flanking tryptophan residues. The magnitude of hydrophobic mismatch is considered to be a function of the distance between interfacial anchoring residues, here tryptophans, and not the overall peptide length (De Planque and Killian 2003) . In this respect, tryptophan residues are known to provide the highest tendency for localization at the interface between the lipid bilayer core and the polar lipid headgroup. Hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions are discussed to account for the interfacial anchoring and z positioning of membrane-incorporated peptides (De Planque and Killian 2003; Doux and Killian 2010) .",

Huang and coworkers observed a stretching of a DLPC lipid bilayer upon incorporation of gramicidin A that likewise adopts b-helical structures, similar to the D,L-alternating peptides applied in the presented approach (Harroun et al. 1999) . In previous studies of the homodimeric species 1, comparable effects were indicated by a thickening of the lipid bilayers of 1.4 \u00c5 (DMPC = 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and 4.0 \u00c5 (DLPC), respectively (K\u00fcsel et al. 2007 ). Finally, the reflectivity experiments of the designed peptide hairpin structures 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 unambiguously prove a positive mismatch situation, also for the hairpin structures, as presented in Table 2 . Such mismatching promotes stretching of the lipid chains and reduction in gauche conformations in the lipid acyl chains. The mismatch situation as well as the described lateral effects may be directly coupled or, alternatively, may independently contribute to the observed changes in a and n upon peptide insertion, as addressed in the following section.",

The shortening of the acyl chain distance a appears more pronounced for the homodimeric species 4 (sample 2) at a helix-to-lipid ratio of 1/20 (P/L = 1/10) but is even stronger for the hairpin species 5 at the same helix-to-lipid ratio (P/L = 1/20). Considering the recognition system 3/6 (equimolar) at RH = 94% (sample 5), the shortening of a is less distinct but can also be assigned to a lower helix-to-lipid ratio of 1/40 (P/L = 1/20). The concentration effect can be factored out by comparing different samples (3 and 4) of the hairpin species at P/L = 1/20 and P/L = 1/40, respectively, showing that higher peptide concentration yields shorter lipid chain distances. It can further be concluded that the recognition system 3/6 (equimolar ratio) at RH = 94% (sample 5) has less impact on a than the respective hairpin peptide 5 (sample 4) at identical P/L = 1/40. The values for the lipid chain correlation length n follow an almost opposing trend as that observed for a. Peptide incorporation generally leads to an increase in n. In principle, the homodimer (4), hairpin (5), and recognition system (3/6) structures are designed to adopt an identical secondary structure with respect to their TMDs. In the case of the hairpin structure 2, due to a decline in helix propensity compared to the homodimeric species 1 as revealed by CD spectroscopy , it was assumed that the hairpin structure exhibits steric clashes in the reverse-turn region leading to a less perfect alignment of the double strands and a broadening of the helix diameter. Therefore, the self-associated homodimer 4 should provide a closer alignment enabled by hydrogen bonding of the two antiparallel-oriented strands. The PNA recognition system 3/6 leading to an aggregation of two of the double helices in a close contact state would yield more than a doubled lateral occupied area within the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2c) . Under these circumstances, the lateral dimensions of the peptide species are supposed to increase in the order: homodimer (4) ? hairpin (5) ? recognition system (3/6).",

In line with the lipid disordering scenario discussed above, larger peptide cross-sectional areas and peptide lipid contact surfaces would probably cause higher values for the lipid acyl chain distance a and smaller values for the lipid correlation length n. This is true if peptide/lipid interactions are neglected or a repulsive potential between lipids and peptides is assumed (Lag\u00fce et al. 2001) . For the present sample sequence: homodimer (4) ? hairpin (5) ? recognition system (3/6), this would imply an increase in a and a decrease in n. The fact that the observed results point to the opposite may be taken as evidence for attractive peptide lipid interactions. Due to the sequence identity of the antiparallel TMD strands of all peptide species, and therefore, the constitutional similarity of the postulated attractive peptide/lipid interactions, only the peptide secondary structure, i.e., the lateral sizes of the peptides, and the size of the lipid/peptide interfacial plane should affect a and n. Therefore, a monotonous decrease in the lipid chain distance would be expected for samples 1-3, which is in line with the obtained results (Fig. 5b) . On the contrary, a monotonous increase in the chain correlation length was not observed. The value for n of the homodimeric species 4 (sample 2) appears higher than that for the hairpin 5 (sample 3). This might be explained by the fact that oligomer 4 is known to experience a monomer-dimer equilibrium (K\u00fcsel et al. 2007 ) including a structural change from a membrane-spanning b 5.6 helix to two reasonable broader and shorter b 6.3 single helices (Fig. 2) . This would actually change the peptide dimensions in the z direction as well as the molecular constitution of the helix surface and therefore cause different hydrophobic mismatch situations as well as changed lateral peptide/lipid interactions.",

In contrast, X-ray reflectivity in combination with contrast variation by heavy atom labeling can provide structural constraints down to subnanometer resolution for fluid or condensed peptide/lipid samples. For a fast in-house approach, the analysis of the electron density difference is a unique method to obtain highly resolved information about the localization of a certain structural element within a lipid bilayer (Fig. 7) . As shown in previous studies for the double helical homodimer 1, this method is even capable of producing evidence of a transmembrane peptide orientation within the lipid bilayer via iodine labeling at several positions (K\u00fcsel et al. 2007 ). With the iodine-labeling approach, the alignment of the membrane-spanning helical hairpin formed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus E protein could be elucidated by localizing the Phe23 adjacent to the lipid headgroup region (Arbely et al. 2004; Khattari et al. 2006a, b) . Instead of determining the label position by a comparison of the deduced electron densities q(z) resulting from unlabeled and labeled samples, this can also be accomplished using an isomorphic sample and applying different photon energies (Khattari et al. 2005) .",

The analysis of the electron density difference profiles then allowed for the determination of the iodine positions with high accuracy (Schneggenburger et al. 2009 ). Even for the Fmoc-Phe(4-I)-OH single label, P/L ratios of 1/50 turned out to be sufficient. Therefore, in-house reflectivity studies and anomalous reflectivity using synchrotron radiation were both performed at P/L = 1/50. Three differentially labeled peptide species, 5, 7, and 8 (Fig. 8) , were used to test for a transmembrane orientation.

These probably stem from misalignment or drift when changing the photon energies. Thus, the two approaches of contrast variation (in-house and synchrotron) are not in quantitative agreement. For the in-house measurement, the effect of a decrease in electron density contrast of the side minima compared to the global minimum is observed in most peptide/lipid systems. The decrease can be explained by a beginning lipid disorder that evens the density profile by increased density in the water layer and/or an enlarged area per headgroup ; this effect may be more pronounced for a peptide carrying a bulky iodine label. However, we also cannot rule out systematic errors for the in-house measurements, and beyond the thickening effect, which appears to be robust, the small differences between curves with and without labels may impede an unambiguous localization of the iodine position. Finally, we must be cautious since iodine-labeling itself may influence peptide/lipid interactions. However, there is no obvious reason why attachment of the iodine labels at different positions should cause different peptide positioning, especially as the iodine labels have been shown to have only minor effects on the peptide secondary structure (Schneggenburger et al. 2009 ).",

If this is not an artifact of the rather problematic synchrotron experiment, it could be possibly attributed to increased lipid fluctuations or beginning lipid disorder upon localization of the rather bulky iodine labels at the lipid headgroup region. The electron density difference curve shows only two symmetrically distributed maxima at approximately z = \u00b1 15.0 \u00c5 indicating a localization of the iodine labels at the lipid headgroup region tending to the membrane interior. This observation would perfectly fit with a transmembrane orientation of the b-hairpin (Fig. 11i) , although an orientation parallel to the membrane surface at the headgroup region (Fig. 11iii ) cannot be ruled out. Taking into account the observations made for the peptide/lipid complex 7/DLPC/Chol (1/47.5/ 2.5), this appears rather unlikely, since the depth of the insertion should not depend on the position of the label along the helix. The distance between the maxima of the electron density difference curve, associated with the distance of the two iodine labels is about 32 \u00c5 (see the Electronic Supplementary Material). This is in good agreement with the expectation based on a peptide length of 26 \u00c5 and the additional spacing of the Phe(4-I) side chains attached at both ends of the double helix and pointing to opposite directions (Schneggenburger et al. 2009 ).",

Compared to b-structures of gramicidin A that are likewise assumed for peptide 7 or the unlabeled analog 2 with a periodicity of 5.6 or 6.3, the investigated b-hairpin with a strand length of 12 residues would give a peptide length of 28.8 or 20.8 \u00c5 , respectively (Fahsel et al. 2002) . This would not directly match a transmembrane orientation without assuming additional effects from distortions, tilt (Fig. 11iv) , or a coexisting population (Fig. 11v) . The rather flat difference curve of the in-house data for species 7 appears less conclusive than difference curves with more clearly identifiable maxima.",

The peak-to-peak distance of the electron density curves reveals a headgroup spacing of approximately 33 \u00c5 (4.55 keV) and 32 \u00c5 (5.80 keV), respectively. The corresponding electron density difference curve is pronounced due to the double signal intensity resulting from the double iodinated label, but differences in resolution at the different X-ray energies may also play a role. The profile shows strong maxima at \u00b115.4 \u00c5 and additional inflection points around \u00b17.1 \u00c5 (Fig. 10d) . The maxima at \u00b115.4 \u00c5 may indicate a transmembrane orientation of the b-hairpin structure 8 nearly spanning the same distance as the terminally labeled sample 7/DLPC/Chol. The electron density difference curve of in-house reference measurements does not show significant rises in the headgroup region, but only at the membranes outside (\u00b121.4 \u00c5 ) in the membrane water layer (see above). A rather diffuse and less intense maximum appears spread out over the bilayer hydrophobic core.",

While the synchrotron experiment faced technical challenges related to the relative low photon energy (L III edge) and sample realignment after beam drift when changing the energy, as well as intrinsically lower contrast, the comparison of two different, not necessarily isomorphic, samples in the in-house study may also pose a challenge. In other words, the differences from one sample to the next may be on the same order as the label effect itself. Note that one needs a much higher reproducibility to interpret the difference curve than the rather gross features of the profiles before subtraction. Therefore, we consider the results regarding the membrane repeat spacing to be more reliable and consistent than conclusions drawn from the peptide labels.",

While a good approach in principle, this part of the presented work showed results that were less consistent and thus less conclusive due to experimental difficulties.

For all samples, i.e., the pure lipid phase (sample 1) as well as the varied P/L compositions (samples 2-9), the lipid fraction consists of DLPC/Chol (95/5). The values of the lipid acyl chain distance a and the lipid chain correlation length n were obtained via analysis of the lipid chain correlation peak by Lorentzian fitting of the intensity traces at / = 8\u00b0q An example of reciprocal space mapping (a) is shown for sample 9(Table 1). The primary beam is located in the origin of the coordinate system with the specular axis covered by a lead stripe on the left hand side. Extensions of the Bragg sheets can be identified as streaks. The lipid chain correlation peak (cc peak) stretches around a circle with the radius q % 1.4 \u00c5 (dotted line). The peak at q k & 1.7, q z & 1.1 results from the silicon substrate and can be applied for alignment. From sections through the reciprocal space (black bars), intensity traces of the cc peak (chain correlation length n are mean values averaged over the entire lipid bilayer stack illuminated by the X-ray beam. The acyl chain distance a reflects the lateral lipid packing. Smaller values for a correspond to a denser packing. The lipid ordering (short range order) is expressed by the acyl chain correlation length n. The obtained values for a and n are presented in",
