Based on the pathologic processes, acute appendicitis is classified into early acute appendicitis, acute suppurative appendicitis, and acute gangrenous appendicitis [1] . Other than an obstructive process in some cases [2] , the exact cause of appendicitis is largely unknown. Possible factors include low dietary fiber and high sugar intake [3] , bacterial [4 -6] and viral infections [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , parasite infestation [12] , and allergy [13] . Epidemiologic studies have shown that appendicitis is most common in the 10-to 29-year-old age group [14 -16] , and that the male-to-female ratio is approximately 3 to 2 [15, 17] . A reported seasonal variation [18] and two reported clusters of acute appendicitis seem to support an infectious etiology [19, 20] .",

The unique epidemiologic and pathologic features of the cases led us to consider this to be a special kind of acute appendicitis, which may have resulted from a potential infectious agent. We tentatively call this special kind of appendicitis \"acute hemorrhagic appendicitis,\" owing to the hemorrhages seen microscopically.",

Case history, physical examination, laboratory tests, pathology examination, and exposure history were also recorded. Patients were identified by reviewing hospital records. Exposure history was obtained by interviewing the patients. Twenty-nine of the 31 patients operated on were from one hospital, from which clinical and laboratory data were obtained for the study; the other 2 patients, who were operated on but whose clinical and laboratory data were not obtained, were not hospitalized at the collaborating hospital. Routine blood tests were performed before surgery for all patients. All histologic slides from the appendectomies were reexamined in the Department of Pathology and World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Tropical Diseases, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas.

Two normal controls were selected for each case. One control was selected from an adjacent seat in the classroom of the patient, and the other was selected randomly from the same dormitory room as the patient. The matching variables included sex and age. A questionnaire consisted of two parts: (1) clinical history: presence or absence of a cold before the onset of symptoms, stomach disease, typhus fever, dysentery, ascariasis, and schistosomiasis; and (2) exposure factors: presence or absence of unclean or spoiled food intake before the onset of symptoms, type of food intake, dinner party, washing hands before meals, ingestion of water not boiled. To probe why the incidence rate was higher among female students, we also collected gynecologic and menstrual history of the female patients. The female patients were divided into three groups according to the phase of menstrual cycle in which they presented with appendicitis: the menstrual group (day 1 to 5 after the onset of the period), the follicular group (day 6 to 14 after the onset), and the luteal group (day 15 to 28 after the onset). To correct for the different lengths of each phase, the incidence of disease was calculated by dividing the number of instances in each phase by the length of days.",

Thirty-one operative cases of acute appendicitis (29 students operated on) occurred in this high school from the onset for the initial cluster (April 1997) to the end of this study (June 2000), among a total of 42 patients who had clinical manifestations of the disease. Among the operated on cases, 11 occurred during the initial cluster (from April 10 to June 11, 1997), with 9 of the 11 cases clustered in a 28-day period from May 14 to June 11, 1997 (Table 1) . Two incidence peaks occurred, one between May 14 and May 21, the other between May 29 and June 11. Among the 11 cases, only 1 staff member (a 21-year old man) had appendicitis during the cluster; he had a high level of contact with student patients. Five additional cases (4 female and 1 male) presented with clinical manifestations of acute appendicitis, but were not operated on (data not shown).",

A case-control study of these patients indicated that sweets in the diet and consumption of local farm eggs may have been associated with the appendicitis. They hypothesized that a group of young male patients who were susceptible to appendicitis because of the high sugar content of their diets were exposed to a bacterium or virus that precipitated this cluster of appendicitis. About the cluster, the Centers for Disease Control [21] published an editorial note that the cluster of appendicitis offered a unique opportunity to identify possible risk factors and to search for precipitating infectious agents. The CDC encouraged reporting such clusters to the Enteric Disease Branch, Center for Infectious Diseases. Andersson et al [20] described \"three outbreaks\" that occurred in a city of Sweden during a 22-year period. On three occasions, a significantly increased number of cases were observed in 60 days, as compared with expected cases, with a range of 1.6 to 2.2. That did not represent a typical cluster. The incidence rates in this city were lower than those Martin reported. Our study reports an incidence rate more than 10 times higher than those reported in the above two reports.",

            "text": "Published studies have indicated that the expected incidence rate of appendicitis is about 1.5 cases per 1,000 persons [15, 22] . It is generally accepted that appendicitis is a sporadic, noncommunicable disease process more frequently found in males than females. The majority of the patients have elevated WBC and differential WBC. Pathologic examinations usually reveal purulent inflammation with neutrophils. In this study, the control patients had the above features of classic acute appendicitis, whereas the patients from the high school cluster exhibited an obviously different pattern. On the basis of the epidemiologic and pathologic features, we hypothesize that the patients from the high school had a special kind of appendicitis, which might have been caused by an infectious agent. Our reasons are as follows: (1) the occurrence of outbreak and clustering are usually characteristics of infectious diseases, and classic appendicitis does not occur in this pattern; (2) female patients were more common than male patients, in contrast to classic appendicitis in which males predominate; (3) many patients had a history of mutual contact before the onset of symptoms, suggesting person-to-person transmission; (4) with the exception of 4 cases, all of the postcluster patients were students enrolled right after the cluster; (5) only a minority of the patients had mildly elevated WBC or differential WBC; and (6) gross pathologic examination of the appendices revealed only minimal purulent change, and microscopic examination revealed hemorrhagic features mainly with infiltration and exudation of lymphocytes as well as infiltration of eosinophiles. In addition, the average lag time between onset of symptoms and surgical intervention was more than twice that of control patients. Therefore, the unique features of the patients from the high school cluster are not early manifestations of classic acute appendicitis; instead, they seem to represent a special kind of appendicitis process. The absence of parasite eggs in the students' appendices and the negative history of intestinal parasites excluded parasitic infection. Tobe [7] reported that Coxsackie virus B2 and B5 and adenovirus type 7 were demonstrated in appendiceal tissues of the cases with appendicitis. We were not able to find positive results using monoclonal mouse antienterovirus clone 5-D8/1 and monoclonal antiadenovirus group.",

This exclusion is based on the following: the staff and students used one canteen and water source, and none of the staff suffered from the disease except for 1, who lived with the students; the students did not have a dinner party (single common exposure) before the cluster; and incidence rates between resident students and nonresident students having meals at home were very similar. As the students were in close contact with each other without exposure to suspected physical or chemical factors, it is postulated that the cluster probably resulted from person-to-person transmission.",

All features suggest that this cluster represents a special kind of acute appendicitis, with clinical features of classic acute appendicitis but also with unique pathologic findings, namely, hemorrhage in the lamina propria and hyperplastic lymphoid follicles. Epidemiologic features also suggest that this condition may be caused by an infectious agent. We tentatively name this condition \"acute hemorrhagic appendicitis.\" Investigations to identify an infectious agent from these cases are ongoing.",
