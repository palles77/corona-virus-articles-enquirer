            "text": "To investigate whether rubella virus (RUB) undergoes intermolecular RNA-RNA recombination, cells were cotransfected with pairs of in vitro transcripts from genomic cDNA plasmid vectors engineered to contain nonoverlapping deletions: the replicative transcript maintained the 5\u0408-proximal nonstructural (NS) ORF (which contained the replicase, making it RNA replication competent), had a deletion in the 3\u0408-proximal structural protein (SP) ORF, and maintained the 3\u0408 end of the genome, including the putative 3\u0408 cis-acting elements (CSE), while the nonreplicative transcript consisted of the 3\u0408 half of the genome including the SP-ORF and 3\u0408 CSE. Cotransfection yielded plaque-forming virus that synthesized the standard genomic and subgenomic RNAs and thus was generated by RNA-RNA recombination. Using transcripts tagged with a 3\u0408-terminal deletion, it was found that recombinants contained the 3\u0408 end derived from the replicative strand, indicating a cis-preference for initiation of negative-strand synthesis. In cotransfections in which the replicative transcript lacked the 3\u0408 CSE, recombination occurred, albeit at lower efficiency, indicating that initiation in trans from the NS-ORF can occur. The 3\u0408 CSE was sufficient as a nonreplicative transcript, showing that it can serve as a promoter for negative-strand RNA synthesis. While deletion mutagenesis showed that the presence of the junction untranslated region (J-UTR) between the ORFs appeared to be necessary on both transcripts for recombination in this region of the genome, analysis with transcripts tagged with restriction sites showed that the J-UTR was not a hot spot for recombination compared to neighboring regions in both ORFs. Sequence analysis of recombinants revealed that both precise (homologous) and imprecise recombination (aberrant, homologous resulting in duplications) occurred; however, imprecise recombination only involved the J-UTR or the 3\u0408 end of the NS-ORF and the J-UTR (maintaining the NS-ORF), indicating selection pressure against duplications in other regions of the genome.",

Hahn et al., 1988; Kew et al., 2002) and among virus families (e.g., Zhang et al., 1992) . Kirkegaard and Baltimore (1986) provided evidence for a copy-choice or template-switching mechanism for RNA recombination in poliovirus in which the viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp)-nascent progeny strand complex switches templates during negative-strand transcription of a positive-strand template, leaving one template (the donor strand) and continuing synthesis of the progeny strand on a second template (the acceptor strand). Most subsequent studies have provided evidence consistent with recombination occurring during RNA replication as a result of template switching, during either negative-or positive-strand synthesis, and template switching has been demonstrated in vitro with highly purified viral RdRps (Arnold and Cameron, 1999; Kim and Kao, 2001) ; however, recombination due to a nonreplicative mechanism has been reported (Gmyl et al., 1999) . Both homologous and nonhomologous recombination have been documented and high-frequency recombination sites or \"hot spots\" have been described (Lai, 1992; Nagy and Simon, 1997) .",

            "text": "Rubella virus (RUB) is the only member of the Rubivirus genus of the family Togaviridae. The RUB genomic RNA is a single-stranded, 9762-nt, positive-sense RNA that contains two long open reading frames (ORFs): a 5\u0408-proximal ORF which encodes nonstructural proteins (NSP) that function primarily in viral RNA replication, including the RdRp, and a 3\u0408-proximal ORF which encodes the virion structural proteins (SP), the capsid protein (C), and two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. The genomic RNA serves as a template for synthesis of a complementary minus-strand RNA which is the template for synthesis of both the genomic RNA and the subgenomic (SG) RNA, from which the structural proteins are translated (Frey, 1994) . Samestrand, intramolecular recombination by RUB has been reported and studied using genomic cDNA plasmid vectors in which the subgenomic promoter (SGP) for SG RNA synthesis, which lies in the \"junction\" untranslated region (J-UTR) between the ORFs, has been duplicated for expression of foreign genes (Pugachev et al., 2000; Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . Recombination between the two SGPs of these vectors resulted in deletion of the foreign gene and reconstitution of the wild-type (wt) virus genome. Sequence analysis of recombinants showed that both homologous recombination (precise recombination resulting in a wt sequence as defined by Lai, 1992) and aberrant homologous recombination (imprecise recombination between homologous templates resulting in duplications) within the SGP occurred.",

            "text": "RNA recombination has been well studied in the Alphaviruses, the other Togavirus genus, particularly with Sindbis virus (SIN). Infectious recombinants were initially recovered when cells were cotransfected with different combinations of in vitro transcripts from genomic cDNA plasmid vectors bearing nonoverlapping deletions that rendered them noninfectious Raju et al., 1995) . Of the pair of transcripts, one was \"replicative\" since it preserved the NS-ORF plus the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 ends of the genome (containing cis-acting elements, or CSEs) and thus was capable of RNA replication, while the second transcript was \"nonreplicative\" since it did not contain a complete copy of the NS-ORF and lacked one or both of the CSEs. Homologous, aberrant homologous, and nonhomologous recombination were detected (nonhomologous recombination results from participation of a nonhomologous template resulting in incorporation of unrelated sequence into the recombinant; Lai, 1992) . Sequence analysis of the 3\u0408UTR of recombinants suggested that only limited homology existed between the substrate templates at sites of recombination (Hajjou et al., 1996) . Additionally, it was found that a short RNA consisting of a conserved motif within the 3\u0408UTR plus a poly(A) tail was sufficient to serve as a donor for recombination with an acceptor transcript in which the 3\u0408UTR was replaced with nonviral sequences (Hill et al., 1997) . This result indicated that negative-strand RNA synthesis could initiate on the 3\u0408UTR/poly(A) fragment and thus it was the only sequence necessary for initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated RUB intermolecular RNA-RNA recombination between replicating and nonreplicating RNA transcripts containing nonoverlapping deletions. Considering the previous studies on SIN that used recombination to define the minimal signal for negative-strand initiation, we were additionally interested in taking a similar approach to define the minimal RUB 3\u0408CSE's required for negative-strand initiation. The 3\u0408-terminal 305 nts of the genome are retained in RUB DI RNAs generated during undiluted serial passaging, implying that the 3\u0408CSE are located within this region, which includes both the 3\u0408SPcoding sequences and the 60-nt 3\u0408UTR (Frey and Hemphill, 1988; Derdeyn and Frey, 1995) . In addition to functioning as a CSE, this region of the RUB genome is also of interest because a stem-loop (SL) structure within it binds an autoantigen, calreticulin (CAL) (Nakhasi et al., 1990; Singh et al., 1994) . Mutagenic analysis of the CAL-binding SL, the 3\u0408UTR, and poly(A) tract within the 3\u0408-305-nt region using a RUB genomic cDNA plasmid vector revealed that most of the 3\u0408UTR is critical for replication with the exception of the 3\u0408-five nucleotides and the poly(A) tract (which was rapidly regenerated in vivo) (Chen and Frey, 1999) . Additionally, it was found that mutations which destabilized CAL binding to the SL had no effect on replication. However, because most of the 3\u0408-305-nt region encodes E1, extensive mutagenesis of the region could not be done using a genomic cDNA vector. Therefore, the ability to segregate this region as a recombination donor offers the opportunity to test which parts of it are necessary for negative-strand initiation.",

Following cotransfection of Vero cells with transcripts from a replicative, defectiveinterfering RNA construct with a deletion in the SP-ORF (DI-P3) that maintains the NS-ORF and thus is capable of RNA replication (Tzeng et al., 2001 ) and a nonreplicative (NR) construct containing the 3\u0408 half of the RUB genome (NR-5355-3\u0408; the designation indicates that the construct is nonreplicative and contains the sequences from nt 5355 through the 3\u0408 end of the genome) (Fig. 1A) , cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed and plaque-forming virus was recovered from the transfected culture medium. Neither CPE nor recovery of plaque-forming virus occurred following transfection with either transcript by itself, suggesting that recombination between the transcripts had occurred, resulting in generation of virus. This experiment was repeated with transcripts from NR-5355-3\u0408 and several replicative DI constructs with SP-ORF deletions with similar Fig. 1 . Initial transcript pairs that yielded recombinants. At the top of (A) is a diagram of the RUB genome (ORFs as boxes, UTRs as lines); the vertical line in the J-UTR represents the SG RNA start site. Recombination was initially observed when the four replicating transcripts shown with deletions in the SP-ORF (the nt number in the RUB genome of the deletion breakpoints along with restriction sites used to generate the deletions are given;deletions are indicated by dotted lines) were individually used in cotransfections with the nonreplicating transcript NR-5355-3\u0408. Virus from nine recombinant plaques generated from DI-Stu X NR-5355-3\u0408 cotransfections were amplified in Vero cells. The amplified stocks were used to infect Vero cells and intracellular RNA was extracted and Northern analysis was used to characterize the viral RNAs present as shown in (B). The positions of migration of Robo402, DI-Stu, and NR-5355-3\u0408 transcripts electrophoresed in the same gel are shown in the left margin, while the genome (G), subgenome (SG), and 28 S rRNA (which results in a white space) are indicated in the right margin. The RNA of five of these recombinants (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) was sequenced across the region of overlap between the parental transcripts; the sequence of three of these recombinants was wild-type, while the other two recombinants had duplications in the 3\u0408 end of the NS-ORF and J-UTR, as shown at the bottom (A). To test the effect of transfection reagent on recovery of recombinant virus, seven plates of Vero cells were cotransfected with DI-Stu and NR-5355-3\u0408 transcripts using either Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000. On days 4 -10 posttransfection, the medium from one plate of cells was harvested and the virus present was titered by plaque assay; daily recovery of plaque-forming virus is shown in (C). results (Fig. 1A ). Plates transfected with transcripts from NR-5355-3\u0408 and one of the SP-ORF deletion constructs, DI-Stu, were overlaid with plaque assay agar; plaques were picked and after one round of amplification used to infect Vero cells and the virus-specific RNAs produced were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1B , virus from all of the plaques produced RNAs corresponding to the genomic and SG RNAs, indicating that RNA-RNA recombination had occurred between the transcripts, resulting in generation of wt virus, rather than replication and copackaging of transcripts as has been observed with SIN (Geigenmuller-Gnirke et al., 1991; Weiss and Schlesinger, 1991) .",

            "text": "In subsequent experiments, following cotransfections with pairs of replicative and nonreplicative transcripts, the cells were examined daily for CPE. Following the appearance of putative CPE, the transfected cell-culture fluid was used to infect fresh monolayers of cells, which were then examined for the development of CPE to confirm that recombinant virus had been produced. Cotransfections were repeated at least three times to ensure that the production of virus through recombination between a pair of transcripts was reproducible. In the course of these experiments, both Lipofectamine and Lipofectamine 2000 were used as transfection reagents. In our hands using RUB replicons expressing the GFP reporter gene, Lipofectamine 2000 was roughly seven times more efficient based on the number of cells expressing GFP following transfection of a standard amount of transcripts (5% of the cells fluorescing following Lipofectamine-mediated transfection vs 35% following Lipofectamine 2000 mediated transfection). The different trans-fection reagents also affected the kinetics of appearance of CPE following cotransfection with replicating and nonreplicating transcripts. In a typical cotransfection experiment with DI-Stu and NR-5355-3\u0408, CPE was first observed 5 days posttransfection when Lipofectamine 2000 was used and 8 days posttransfection when Lipofectamine was used. As shown in Fig. 1C , detection of plaque-forming virus coincided with appearance of CPE and occurred 3 days earlier following Lipofectamine 2000 than Lipofectamine-mediated transfection. As will be shown later, the use of transfection reagent affected recovery of recombinants following cotransfections with specific replicative and nonreplicative transcript pairs; in these cases, recombination was detectable if Lipofectamine 2000 was used, but not if Lipofectamine was used. We interpret this to indicate that transfection efficiency was higher with Lipofectamine 2000 in terms of delivery of transcripts to individual cells as well as to number of cells transfected, resulting in more cells containing both transcripts and the presence of more intracellular transcripts in individual cells on which recombination could occur. Alternatively, the presence of more transcripts delivered to individual cells by Lipofectamine 2000 could have increased the functional half-life during which transcripts were available in the cell for recombination to occur.",

            "text": "The standard transcript pair in a recombination assay shown in Fig. 1 overlapped in two regions of the genome: the region containing the 3\u0408 end of the NS-ORF through the J-UTR and the 5\u0408 end of the SP-ORF (1535-1959 nts, depending on the replicative transcript used); and the region at the 3\u0408 end of the genome (310 -591 nts). To produce virus, minimally one recombination in the former region needs to occur. To investigate the requirements for recombination in this region, a series of cotransfections was performed with transcripts containing deletions as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 . When the overlap was minimized less than 100 nts in the SP-ORF (DI-AB or DI-325 cotransfected with NR-7318-3\u0408; a region of overlap of 8 and 95 nts, respectively), no recombination was detected. When the SP-ORF was replaced with the GFP reporter gene in the replicative transcript (RUBrep/GFP), recombination was still detected when NR-5355-3\u0408 was used as the nonreplicative transcript. A series of constructs that progressively deleted the 5\u0408 end of the nonreplicative NR-5355-3\u0408 transcripts was used in cotransfections with RUBre/GFP. Transcripts which retained part of the NS-ORF (NR-6263-3\u0408 and NR-6313-3\u0408) yielded recombinants, while transcripts deleted into the J-UTR (NR-6408-3\u0408 and NR-6436-3\u0408) did not. The region of overlap in these latter two cotransfections was reduced to 108 and 76 nts, respectively; however, when the same series of transcripts as used in cotransfections with DI-Stu, the same observations were made even though the region of overlap with NR-6408-3\u0408 and NR 6436-3\u0408 was increased to 553 and 525 nts, respectively. When Lipo-fectamine 2000 was used as the transfection reagent, recombinants were recovered when NR-6408-3\u0408 and NR-6436-3\u0408 were cotransfected with RUBrep/GFP or DI-Stu, indicating that although recombination occurred, it was inefficient. These observations suggested that the J-UTR was a potential hot spot for recombination relative to the neighboring sequences in the NS-and SP-ORFs or that its presence in the donor strand might be necessary for recombination to occur in this region of the genome. To determine whether or to what extent the J-UTR could be deleted while preserving the ability of recombination to occur, an extensive series of constructs that introduced deletions at the 5\u0408 end of the nonreplicative transcript through the junction UTR was made and these transcripts were cotransfected with DI-Stu transcripts using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. As shown in Table 1 , the minimal nonreplicative transcript that yielded recombinants was NR-6479-3\u0408, the 5\u0408 end of which still contains the thirty-three 3\u0408 nt of the J-UTR (although the overlap with DI-Stu was 482 nts). In cotransfections between DI-Stu and nonreplicative constructs with deletions extending beyond nt 6436, the appearance of CPE was delayed (Table 1) .",

As shown in Fig. 2B , when NDI-Stu and XNR-5355-3\u0408 transcripts were combined in a cotransfection (Lipofectamine 2000) followed by overlaying the transfection plate with plaque assay agar, isolation, and analysis of individual plaques, only recombinants with the parental J-UTRs were recovered. This indicated that recombination had occurred either upstream (recombinants with XbaI site) or downstream (recombinants with NsiI site) from, but not within, the J-UTR. When the reciprocal recombination assay was done, XDI-Stu/NNR-5355-3\u0408, of 10 recombinants analyzed, 3 had parental J-UTRs (two with XbaI and one with NsiI); 2 had a recombinant J-UTR (neither site), while 5 had tandem duplications: 1 within the J-UTR and 4 including both the 3\u0408 end of the NS-ORF and the 5\u0408 end of the J-UTR. In each of these latter four recombinants, the upstream duplication lacked the NsiI site, while the downstream duplication contained it, indicating that in all four cases transcription had proceeded into the NS-ORF on the nonreplicative transcript (NNR-5355-3\u0408) and then Fig. 2 .

Brackets indicate nonreplicating transcripts used individually in cotransfections with a common replicating transcript with a similar result. In some cases, transcript pairs that failed to yield recombinants following Lipofectaine-mediated transfection did yield recombinants when Lipofectamine 2000 was used, as indicated by an asterisk.

Therefore, while the J-UTR could be involved in recombination, it was not the only site at which recombination occurred. The asymmetry of the results in this experiment (i.e., the recombination within the J-UTR when the genetic tags were in one orientation, but not the other) could have been due to selection against recombinants with both restriction sites that would have resulted from a recombination event in the J-UTR in the NDI-Stu/ XNR-5355-3\u0408 cotransfection.

Recombination between replicative constructs that lacked the 3\u0408CSE and nonreplicative constructs that contained the 3\u0408CSE was next explored. It has not been demonstrated that a construct containing the 5\u0408CSE and NS-ORF but lacking the 3\u0408CSE can undergo RNA replication; however, these constructs were considered replicative in the context of these experiments because they contained the NS-ORF and thus could theoretically produce the viral replicase.

Therefore, we reasoned that replication initiated preferentially at the 3\u0408 end of templates which contained the NS-ORF and 3\u0408CSE in cis and that recombination to produce virus resulted if replication subsequently switched to the nonreplicating transcript and then back to the replicating transcript (Fig. 3Bi) . Much less Fig. 3 . Recombination at the 3\u0408 end of the genome. Genomic diagrams of pairs of replicating and nonreplicating transcripts are shown in (A) that either failed to yield recombinants (NO RECOMBINATION) or yielded recombinants (RECOMBINATION) when Lipofectamine was used as the transfection reagent. Brackets indicate both replicating and nonreplicating transcripts used individually in cotransfections with a common replicating transcript(s) with a similar result. In some cases, transcript pairs that failed to yield recombinants following Lipofectaine-mediated transfection did yield recombinants when Lipofectamine 2000 was used, as indicated by an asterisk. In (B) is shown a model based on observations reported in (A) and previous reports that initiation of negative-strand synthesis is preferential for the NS-ORF and 3\u0408CSE in cis. When one of the transcripts has the NS-ORF and 3\u0408CSE in cis (i), negative-strand initiation and subsequent recombination is efficient to the extent that recombination is observed when Lipofectamine is used as the transfection reagent. When the NS-ORF and 3\u0408CSE are in trans (iv), negative-strand initiation and recombination are less efficient and recombination is only observed when Lipofectamine 2000 is employed. This model predicts that when the NS-ORF and 3\u0408CSE are available either in cis or in trans (ii and iii), initiation of minus-strand synthesis will occur preferentially on the 3\u0408CSE in cis with the NS-ORF. To determine from which transcript the 3\u0408 end of the recombinant was derived in such a situation, DI-Stu and NR-5355-3\u0408 transcripts generated from constructs with a wt 3\u0408 end or a construct with a deletion of 5 nt from the 3\u0408 end of the genome [these constructs maintained the poly(A) tract] were used in cotransfections (Lipofectamine 2000) and virus recovered from recombinant plaques was sequenced across the region of overlap at the 3\u0408 end of the genome. As shown in (C), recombinants uniformly had the 3\u0408 end derived from the replicating parental transcript (DI-Stu). efficiently, recombination resulted from initiation at the 3\u0408 end of the nonreplicating template followed by template switching to the replicating transcript, such that it was only observed when Lipofectamine 2000 was used as the transfection reagent (Fig. 3Biii) . To test this hypothesis, a genetic tag consisting of a deletion of the 3\u0408 five nts preceding the poly(A) tract (Chen and Frey, 1999) was introduced into one of the transcripts used in a DI-Stu/NR-5355-3\u0408 cotransfection using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. As shown in Fig.  3C , when DI-Stu transcripts with the \u232c5 tag were cotransfected with NR-5355-3\u0408 transcripts, all of the recombinants had the \u232c5 tag. When the reciprocal cotransfection (DI-Stu/ NR-5355-3\u0408\u232c5) was done, none of the recombinants had the \u232c5 tag. This demonstrated that when both constructs contained the 3\u0408CSE (Fig. 3Bii and 3Biv) , initiation of replication occurred on the transcript with the 3\u0408 end in cis with the NS-ORF, confirming our hypothesis.",

We previously showed that intramolecular recombination could occur, specifically between the SGPs of double subgenomic expression vectors resulting in deletion of the expressed foreign gene (Pugachev et al., 2000; Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . To detect intermolecular recombination, cotransfection with transcripts containing nonoverlapping deletions was employed. One of these transcripts contained the 5\u0408 end of the genome, including the 5\u0408CSE through the NS-ORF and J-UTR, a deletion in the SP-ORF, and the 3\u0408CSE, and therefore was capable of RNA replication. The other transcript, a nonreplicative transcript, contained the 3\u0408 half of the genome beginning from the 3\u0408 end of the NS-ORF. Plaque-forming virus was recovered that synthesized the standard genomic and subgenomic RNAs, demonstrating that RNA-RNA recombination between the transcripts had occurred to generate the standard viral genome rather than replication and copackaging of the transcripts as has been reported with alphaviruses (Geigenmuller-Gnirke et al., 1991; Weiss and Schlesinger, 1991) . To account for incorporation of sequences from both transcripts into the recombinant virus, it is presumed that recombination occurs due to template switching by the viral RdRp during negativestrand RNA synthesis (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986) .",

Transfections with replicative transcripts that lacked the 3\u0408CSE failed to yield recombinants when the lower efficiency transfection reagent Lipofectamine was employed, but were successful when the higher efficiency transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 was used. A requirement for the presence of the 3\u0408CSE in cis with the NS-ORF for RNA replication was recently demonstrated in two studies (Liang and Gillam, 2001; Tzeng et al., 2001) and we therefore reasoned that negativestrand RNA synthesis initiated preferentially on the replicative transcript with the 3\u0408CSE in cis with the NS-ORF followed by copy choice transfer of the replication complex to the nonreplicative transcript, resulting in recombination. At a lower efficiency, only detectable when Lipofectamine 2000 was employed as the transfection reagent, initiation occurred on transcripts with the 3\u0408CSE in trans from the NS-ORF. Transcripts genetically tagged with a deletion at the exact 3\u0408 end of the genome were used to prove that in the standard cotransfection in which both the replicative and the nonreplicative transcripts contained the 3\u0408CSE; the 3\u0408CSE in the recombinant was derived from the replicative transcript, even when Lipofectamine 2000 was used, as predicted by our hypothesis. Interestingly, this means that the recombinants recovered from the standard cotransfection were predominantly, if not exclusively, double recombinants, as shown in Fig. 2Bii .

            "text": "Studies on recombination using SIN virus showed that a transcript consisting of the 3\u0408 twenty-nucleotides plus the poly(A) tail was sufficient as a nonreplicative transcript when the replicative transcript was the genome with the 3\u0408UTR replaced with nonviral-plasmid vector sequences, indicating that negative-strand RNA synthesis can initiate on this small 3\u0408-terminal sequence (Hajjou et al., 1996; Hill et al., 1997) . We were interested in taking a similar approach to define the minimal RUB 3\u0408 cis-acting elements required for negative-strand initiation. The 3\u0408-terminal 305 nts of the genome are retained in RUB DI RNAs generated during undiluted serial passage, implying that the complete 3\u0408CSE is located within this region, which includes both 3\u0408 end of the SP-ORF and the 60 nt 3\u0408UTR (Frey and Hemphill, 1988; Derdeyn and Frey, 1995) . Previous mutagenic analysis using both the genomic and the replicon infectious cDNA plasmid vectors had shown that the whole region was necessary for optimal replication but that only the 3\u0408UTR with the exception of the 3\u0408-five nucleotides and the poly(A) tract (which were rapidly regenerated in vivo) is essential for replication (Chen, 1998; Chen and Frey, 1999) , a region that does not include the calreticulin-binding stem-loop. However, because most of the 3\u0408-305-nucleotide region encodes E1, extensive mutagenesis of the region could not be done using an infectious cDNA genomic vector. Therefore, the ability to segregate this region into a recombination donor offers the opportunity to test which parts of it are necessary for negative-strand initiation. Following the design of the SIN experiments, we cotransfected replicative transcripts consisting of the genome with the 3\u0408UTR either deleted or replaced with heterologous sequences such as the SIN 3\u0408UTR or nonviral-plasmid vector sequences and nonreplicative transcripts consisting of the 3\u0408CSE or 3\u0408UTR.",

Hence, the 3\u0408CSE is capable of initiating negative-strand synthesis. This result may indicate that the 3\u0408UTR cannot serve as a promoter for negative-strand synthesis; however, there was no sequence overlap between the 3\u0408UTR and these replicative transcripts and, as demonstrated with recombinational templates with minimal overlap in the SP-ORF, some overlap appears to be necessary for recombination to occur. Additionally, although Lipofectamine 2000 allowed for recovery of recombinants from R-\u232c3\u0408UTR/-, R-3\u0408SINUTR/-, and R-3\u0408NVS/3\u0408CSE cotransfections, appearance of CPE was delayed to the extent that individual plaques could not be recognized due to senescence of the monolayer and when bulk transfection plate culture fluid was harvested and amplified, the recombinant virus was found to have the wt 3\u0408 sequence (data not shown). In contrast, in similar cotransfections, the SIN 3\u0408UTR was found to be able to accommodate extensive rearrangements, including the presence of nonviral sequences. The apparent inability of the RUB 3\u0408UTR to tolerate rearrangements would also serve to limit recombination between replicative transcripts with heterologous 3\u0408UTRs and nonreplicative transcripts consisting of short 3\u0408-terminal fragments. Thus, this experimental model is not applicable to RUB.",

            "text": "We also investigated recombination in the other region of the genome that overlapped between the standard replicative-nonreplicative transcript pair, i.e., the 3\u0408NS-ORF/J-UTR/5\u0408SP-ORF. Deletion analysis indicated that the presence of NS-ORF or the SP-ORF in both transcripts was not necessary for recombination; however, the presence of the J-UTR in both transcripts was necessary for efficient recombination (i.e., Lipofectamine-mediated transfection) and the 3\u0408 end of the J-UTR was essential. This was not due to minimal overlapping sequence requirements since, despite the deletions into the J-UTR, an overlap of 482 nts in the SP-ORF was maintained between the transcripts. Thus, we hypothesized that the J-UTR was a recombinational hot spot. To test this hypothesis, the standard cotransfection was done with transcripts genetically marked on either end of the J-UTR with a restriction site, NsiI at the 5\u0408 end or XbaI at the 3\u0408 end. When XbaI-marked replicative and NsiImarked nonreplicative transcripts were used, recombinants that retained the single site as well as recombinants that had neither site were recovered, indicating that recombination both outside the J-UTR (resulting in recombinants with a single site) and within the J-UTR (resulting in recombinants with neither site) had occurred. Interestingly, the largest class of the recombinants had duplications either within the J-UTR or between the 3\u0408NS-ORF and the J-UTR; the latter recombinants resulted from participation of both regions in the recombination event. Thus, recombination occurred in all regions of the overlap between the transcripts. When NsiI-marked replicative and XbaI-marked nonreplicative transcripts were used, half of the recombinants had only the NsiI site and the other half had the XbaI site; to recover the former recombinant, the recombination event was in the SP-ORF downstream from the J-UTR, while to recover the latter recombinant, the recombination was in the NS-ORF upstream from the J-UTR. A recombination in the J-UTR would have yielded a recombinant with both restriction sites and we initially thought that this type of recombinant was selected against, since recombination in the J-UTR clearly occurred based on results with the reciprocal transcripts. However, a Robo502 construct containing both restriction sites had a wild-type phenotype and the reason for the asymmetry of recombinant recovery is therefore not clear. Nevertheless, these results show that recombination can readily occur outside of the J-UTR. Thus, based on this experiment, the J-UTR does not appear to be a high-avidity recombinational hot spot compared to neighboring sequences in the NS-ORF and SP-ORF. An alternative hypothesis is that a sequence within the J-UTR is necessary in the donor template or on both templates for recombination to occur in this region, whether or not the J-UTR itself is involved in the recombination event. For example, secondary structure in this sequence could interrupt transcription or this sequence could bind a factor that attracts the RdRp complex, facilitating strand transfer. In a plant virus system, it was found that secondary structures that facilitated template switching and recombination were also promoters for RNA replication and bound the viral RdRp (Nagy et al., 1999) . In this regard, in the predicted secondary structure of the J-UTR, there is a stable stem-and-loop structure (\u232cG \u03ed \u03ea21.24 kcal/mol) formed by the 3\u0408 end of the J-UTR (data not shown).",

            "text": "In the 3\u0408 region of the genome, only precise recombinants were recovered, while in the J-UTR region, both precise recombinants and duplications of varying lengths were detected. These events have been defined as homologous and aberrant homologous recombination, respectively (Lai, 1992) . In a study on intramolecular recombination between SGPs in a double subgenomic vector, both precise recombinants and recombinants with duplications in the J-UTR were recovered with the majority being precise recombinants (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . In this study, which covered a larger region of the genome, the duplications involved only the J-UTR or a combination of the 3\u0408NS-ORF and the J-UTR and thus in all cases the integrity of both the NS-ORF and the SP-ORF as well as the 3\u0408UTR was preserved. A similar assortment of recombinants in the J-UTR was recovered when pairs of transcripts corresponding to the transcripts used in this study were used in a study on SIN recombination (Weiss and Schlessinger, 1991) . Therefore, there was apparent selection pressure on maintenance of both ORFs and the 3\u0408UTR. In previous studies, we have found that while the 3\u0408UTR is intolerant of mutagenesis, the J-UTR will accommodate extensive manipulation (Chen and Frey, 1999; Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . Presumably, both precise and imprecise recombinational events occur throughout the genome, but in most of the genome only precise recombinants are viable. It is also possible that duplications caused by imprecise recombination are rapidly removed by intramolecular recombination, as was the case with our double subgenomic vectors (Tzeng and Frey, 2002) . This could explain the discrepancy observed in Northern gels of recombinant viruses in which the RNA species were larger than the standard RNAs, but the duplications detected by sequencing after an additional passage were found to be \u03fd100 nts ( Fig. 1A and B ). An evolution toward the wild-type sequence was also observed with passage of SIN recombinants with duplications in the J-UTR region . Alternatively, duplications could have been present in other regions of the genome that did not overlap between the cotransfected transcripts and were not sequenced in the recombinants.",

NR-5355-3\u0408 was constructed by restriction of Robo402 with BglII and EcoRI, and the BglII and EcoRI fragment was used to ligate with BamHI-EcoRIrestricted pGEM3Z (Promega). NR-5355-3\u0408\u232c5 was constructed by replacing the BamHI-EcoRI fragment in NR-5355-3\u0408 with the amplified PCR product from Robo302 template with primers 52 (nts 9163-9180, including a BamHI site at nt 9174) and 340 [EcoRI followed by oligo (dT) and sequences complementary to nts 9738 -9757]. NR-5355-3\u0408\u232cUTR, which lacks the 3\u0408UTR (nts 9703-9762) but contains a poly(A) tract, was constructed by PCR using Robo302 template, upstream primer 52, and downstream primer 315 (EcoRI site followed by an T 20 tract and sequence complementary to nts 9687-9706 of the genome). The amplification product was restricted with BamHI and EcoRI and used to replace the corresponding fragment in NR-5355-3\u0408. To create a nonreplicative vector that contained the SIN-3\u0408UTR in place of the RUB 3\u0408UTR, the BglII-EcoRI fragment of Robo502-SIN3\u0408UTR was introduced into pGEM11Zf(\u03ea). NR-7318-3\u0408, which contains the 3\u0408 end of the Robo cDNA sequences from nt 7318 (an AscI site) through the 3\u0408 EcoRI linearization site, was constructed by annealing T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) phosphorylated oligos 518 and 519 to produce an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter flanked by 5\u0408 HindIII and 3\u0408 AscI overhangs and using this linker to replace the HindIII-AscI fragment in Robo302. NNR-5355-3\u0408 and XNR-5355-3\u0408 were constructed by restricting NRobo502 and XRobo502, respectively, with BglII and EcoRI and cloning the BglII-EcoRI fragment into BamHI-EcoRI-restricted pGEM-11Zf(\u03ea).

A nonreplicative construct containing the 3\u0408UTR and poly(A) tract, NR-3\u0408UTR, was constructed by PCR amplification using primer 498 (HindIII site followed by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and nts 9706 -9720 of the RUB genome) and primer 105 (EcoRI site followed by T 20 ), restriction of the amplified product with HindIII and EcoRI, and ligation into HindIII-EcoRI restricted pUC18.",
