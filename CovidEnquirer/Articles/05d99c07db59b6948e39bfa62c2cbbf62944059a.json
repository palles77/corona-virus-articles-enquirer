Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate.",

Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to a single large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts in February), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peaks later, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in a smaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter. The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmission over the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. If transmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced, with an attack rate of less than 1% ( Figure 5 , Table 2 ). .

The estimated total number of people infected in the spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has the opportunity to die-out in local parts of the country.
