Stokstad Antibody levels in bulk tank milk (BTM) against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are used to classify BRSV status of herds. The aim of this study was to investigate how these levels correspond with the time at which the herds were infected. Bulk tank milk, individual milk and serum samples from cows and young stock were investigated using an indirect ELISA. Screenings of BTM from 89 dairy herds during two winter seasons revealed a prevalence of positive herds from 82 per cent to 85 per cent. Eleven herds showed a marked increase in antibody levels between two screenings, indicating new infection. However, two of these herds had been free from BRSV for the last five to seven years. Two newly infected herds were monitored for four years and did not appear to get reinfected. Surprisingly, the BTM antibody levels in these herds remained high throughout the study period, but fluctuated significantly. This shows that the levels of antibodies in BTM can remain high for several years, even in herds where reinfection does not occur. BTM serology is a useful tool in the monitoring of infectious diseases in dairy herds, but has limitations as a diagnostic tool for BRSV infections.",

The infection is prevalent worldwide (Elvander 1996 , Paton and others 1998 , Uttenthal and others 2000 , Klem and others 2013 , and BRSV is considered one of the major pathogens of the bovine respiratory disease complex (Griffin 1997 , Snowder and others 2006 , Brodersen 2010 . To diagnose the infection, different strategies can be chosen according to the given situation and the purpose. For larger epidemiological studies, antibody analyses are used (H\u00e4gglund and others 2006 , Beaudeau and others 2010 , Ohlson and others 2010 , Klem and others 2013 . Infected animals seroconvert and IgG can be measured in serum and milk long after the virus is no longer present. Studies on the longevity of antibodies against BRSV are scarce, but Elvander (1996) found that such antibodies could be detected in the serum of adult cattle for at least two years postinfection.",

The number of herds tested declined in the course of the sampling period due to farms shutting down and failure to take samples.

The time points were chosen in order to cover two winter seasons, as the peak incidence of clinical cases of respiratory disease by experience is expected to occur in the winter months. Some herds remained negative during the study period, but the majority were positive on both occasions. In a few herds, the results indicated elimination and new introduction of BRSV infection. Measurement of antibodies in BTM is a very slow changing tool to monitor BRSV infection in a herd. Klem and others (2013) found the elimination rate and number of new introductions of virus on a herd level to be high. In that study, the herds were classified based on serological findings in a group of young animals, which gives a more updated classification. Testing using BTM has lower power with regard to the correct classification of a herd's virus status than testing of individual milk samples and testing of serum from young animals (Klem and others 2013, Ohlson and others 2013) . Some negative herds were located in close proximity to positive herds. This may be due to better biosecurity measures in the negative herds. Another possible explanation is that the nearby positive herds are negative for virus, and thus do not represent a risk. Since the The herds were selected based on a high increase in level of antibodies (PP) against BRSV in two consecutive BTM samplings prior to the sampling occasion shown *The time since infection is based on analyses of antibodies in serum from the lactating cows and younger animals. The lower limit is defined by the age of the oldest animal negative for BRSV antibodies and the upper limit by the youngest positive animal. When all animals tested positive, the time since infection is indicated as less than the age of the youngest sampled animal PP, per cent positivity present study also shows that herds can be BTM-antibody-positive for more than four years without reinfection, the latter is likely. It would be interesting to see if herds can keep a negative status in proximity to herds that go through a new infection. In this study, both the number of negative herds and herds with new infection were too low to allow such investigations. Relatively large fluctuations in the PP values in samples taken only two weeks apart were found, and thus care should be taken when interpreting the results of a single BTM sample. A high value does not necessarily mean that BRSV has been present in the herd recently. Even a relatively large increase in paired samples taken two weeks apart can be observed in herds without viral introduction, based on the negative antibody status of younger animals. Detection of antibodies against BRSV in young cattle to reveal new introduction into a herd should be an adequate measure as the virus is reported to spread rapidly in herds during outbreaks (Rossi and Kiesel 1974 , Stott and others 1980 , Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt 1984 , Bidokhti and others 2009 . The fluctuation cannot be explained by methodological errors as analyses of reproducibility show stable values for the positive controls. The level of antibodies in BTM is influenced by the composition of the milking herd. The immune status (antibody levels against BRSV) of the individual cows, the milk yield and which animals contribute to the bulk tank milk from day to day are the main reasons for fluctuating levels of antibodies in the BTM. Age distribution will also influence the outcome as the prevalence of antibodies against BRSV within a herd is reported to increase with increasing age of the animals (Bidokhti and others 2009, Klem and others 2013) . This might be due to reinfections that boost the antibody response.",

The results showed that a BTM sample can be positive with relatively high PP values despite only one or a few positive animals contributing to the milk tank.
