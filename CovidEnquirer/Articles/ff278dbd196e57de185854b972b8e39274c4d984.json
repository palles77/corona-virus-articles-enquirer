Tissue bath experiments: Tissue preparation. The excised bladders were placed in a Petri dish with chilled Krebs solution and carefully dissected free from sparse adherent connective tissue. Full-thickness longitudinal bladder strips of uniform size (approximately 7 mm. long and 2 mm. wide) were obtained from both the regenerates and the host bladder wall. With the former, great care was taken to ensure that only regenerated bladder from within the area delineated by the marking sutures was used. The strips were mounted in the tissue bath to a glass tissue support hook on one side and an isometric force displacement transducer (Radnoti Glass Technology, Monrovia CAI on the other by means of two spring wire clips connected with 4 -0 braided silk. All preparations were sufficiently durable to withstand the grip of the wire clips during repeated or continuous contractions.

On histological examination (see fig. 3 ), all BAMG regenerates showed a bladder wall structure qualitatively indistinguishable from the host bladder. The generally uniform urothelial lining was sometimes found to be hyperplastic in cases of extensive bladder stone formation. Differentiated muscularis mucosae and spatially oriented, well-developed detrusor smooth muscle were formed by a-actin-positive smooth muscle cells. In the 4-month specimen, the thickness of the muscle bundles seemed to decrease toward the center of the graft, whereas revascularization appeared to be equally pronounced at the edges and in the mid-area of the BAMG regenerates. The two 8.5-month specimens, however, seemed to be characterized by a more balanced dispersion of vessels and muscle fibers throughout the graft. The number of a-actin-positive cells appeared qualitatively stable and the density of blood vessels seemed to decrease in comparison with the 4-month specimen. The collagen content and density showed almost complete desensitization to a second admin- of small-and large-diameter blood vessels appeared qualitatively greater in the BAMG regenerates. The opposite seemed true for the amount of smooth muscle at 4 and 8.5 months after grafting. PGP-positive nerve fibers could be found predominantly next to muscle bundles and the luminal surface of the graft. Their size and number increased over time. These light-microscopic findings were consistent with Previous studies from our' lab that used digitized slides for a quantitative computer-assisted evaluation of graft differentiation over time? Differentid nerve staining revealed that cholinergic, adrenergic and NADPH diaphorase-positive fibers were present in the host bladder wall tissue as well as in the BAMG regenerates (fig. 4) .",

C, isoproterenol M) lowers resting tension to zero in both BAMG regenerates and lost bladder stri s at 4 months &er surgery. Pretreatment with Prqpranolol (3 X M) as specific p1 +,-adrenergic blocker does not inhibit isoproterenofinduced relaxation, but persistently prevents all strips from resuming spontaneous muscle activity.

The reaction was terminated by washing with buffer, and the sections were coverslipped with a 9:l mixture of glycerollphosphate Seen as a dark blue precipitate against a pale blue, nonstained ba~kgr0und.l~ Statistics. Student's t test was used to compare the re-SPonses between control and BAMGregenerated bladder strips; p values< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All data are presented as mean 2 S.E.M. buffer (pH 8.6). Areas staining for NADPH-diaphorase wereRESULTSMortality. Eleven of the 31 rats died postoperatively; 8 of these (4 ma144 female) died within 48 hours of uremia consequent to urinary extravasation into the abdominal cavity.(The 4 male rats were found to have complete obstruction of the bladder neck and proximal urethra from a staghorn stonelike plug of coagula and defurfurated fibers of the BAMG.) Leakage occurred only at the site of anastomosis; a rupture of the graft itself was never seen. Two of the 11 (1 maldl female) died after 6 and 10 days of infection (abscess, sepsis); 1 male rat died after 2 months from a Corona virus infection. Twenty surviving rats (10 maldl0 female) were available for evaluation.Bladder stone formation. Within 4 months, bladder calculi (1 to 7 stones) occurred in 16 of 20 grafted rats (80%). They were composed of struvite (60 to loo%), apatite (40 to loo%),",
