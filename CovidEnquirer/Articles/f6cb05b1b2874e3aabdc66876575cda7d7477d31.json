Feline tumor necrosis factor (fTNF)-alpha is closely involved in the aggravation of FIP pathology. We previously described the preparation of neutralizing mouse anti-fTNF-alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb 2-4) and clarified its role in the clinical condition of cats with FIP using in vitro systems. However, administration of mouse mAb 2-4 to cat may lead to a production of feline anti-mouse antibodies. In the present study, we prepared a mouse-feline chimeric mAb (chimeric mAb 2-4) by fusing the variable region of mouse mAb 2-4 to the constant region of feline antibody. The chimeric mAb 2-4 was confirmed to have fTNF-alpha neutralization activity. Purified mouse mAb 2-4 and chimeric mAb 2-4 were repeatedly administered to cats, and the changes in the ability to induce feline anti-mouse antibody response were investigated. In the serum of cats treated with mouse mAb 2-4, feline anti-mouse antibody production was induced, and the fTNF-alpha neutralization effect of mouse mAb 2-4 was reduced. In contrast, in cats treated with chimeric mAb 2-4, the feline anti-mouse antibody response was decreased compared to that of mouse mAb 2-4-treated cats.",

Several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen and central nervous system, are affected in cats that develop FIP, and the formation of lesions in these organs is accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation [13] . Pleural effusion and ascitic fluid were reported to accumulate in some cats. Macrophages/monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP. For example, differences in the proliferation of macrophages/monocytes were shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV [2, 16] . FECV and FIPV cannot be serologically or genetically distinguished from each other; however, FECV infection is normally asymptomatic in cats.",

TNF-alpha binds to cell surface TNF receptors and induces various physiological activities [15, 23] . TNF-alpha plays a critical role in many aspects of immunity. However, the excessive production of TNF-alpha can lead to acute inflammation and immune system abnormalities in human and other animals. The involvement of TNF-alpha in aggravating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease has been reported [1, 9, 24] . Moreover, previous studies have described aggravation of the pathologies of viral infections (such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and dengue virus infections) due to increased TNF-alpha production [5, 12, 14, 21, 25] . TNF-alpha was produced excessively by FIPV-infected macrophages. TNF-alpha was involved in lymphopenia and increase in the level of the cellular receptor of serotype II FIPV, aminopeptidase N (APN) [18, 19] . It is also reported that neutrophil apoptosis in cats with FIP was inhibited by TNF-alpha. This finding suggests neutrophilia in cats with FIP due to TNF-alpha-induced neutrophil survival [17] .",

We previously described the preparation of a feline TNF-alpha (fTNF-alpha)neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-fTNF-alpha mAb, mAb [2] [3] [4] . This mAb 2-4 exhibited high neutralizing activity against recombinant and natural TNF-alpha, and was confirmed to inhibit the following fTNF-alpha-induced conditions in vitro: i) an increase in the survival rate of neutrophils from cats with FIP, ii) APN mRNA expression in macrophages and iii) apoptosis of a feline T-lymphocyte cell line [4] . These findings strongly suggested that mAb 2-4 is applicable as a therapeutic drug against FIP. We are also investigating that mouse mAb 2-4 administration to SPF cats experimentally infected with FIPV alleviated the clinical condition of cat with FIP [3] . However, because this is a mouse-derived antibody and is a xenogeneic protein for cats, induction of feline anti-mouse antibodies may reduce the reactivity of mouse mAb 2-4 against fTNF-alpha.",

In addition to neutralizing human TNF-alpha, which is a factor aggravating the pathology of RA, infliximab directly injures TNF-alpha-producing cells expressing TNF-alpha on the cell surface through antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Infliximab exhibits its treatment effect against RA through these actions. Infliximab is repeatedly administered at 4-or 8-week intervals until RA remission is observed. Accordingly, to reduce antigenicity for humans, infliximab is expressed in mammalian cells as a mouse-human chimeric antibody prepared by fusing the variable region of mouse mAb and the constant region of human antibody [20] . Human anti-mouse antibody response to the mouse-human chimeric mAb was reduced compared to that of the mouse mAb response, and the adverse reactions after administration were also reduced. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that the feline anti-mouse antibody response and the development of adverse reactions after administration may be reduced by substituting the amino acid sequence of the feline antibody constant region for that of the mAb 2-4 constant region.",

Anti-mouse IgG antibody reacted with mouse mAb 2-4 but did not react with chimeric mAb 2-4, whereas anti-feline IgG antibody did not react with mouse mAb 2-4 but reacted with chimeric mAb 2-4, confirming that the antigenicity of chimeric mAb 2-4 is similar to that of feline IgG. When neutralization of fTNF-alpha by purified chimeric mAb 2-4 was investigated, chimeric mAb 2-4 neutralized recombinant and natural fTNF-alpha, similarly to mouse mAb 2-4.

Umehashi et al. reported the relationship between repeated administration of mouse mAb and mouse-feline chimeric mAb and the induction of anaphylactic reactions, in which several administrations of 10 mg/kg mouse mAb or chimeric mAb did not cause any anaphylactic reaction in cats, whereas 50 mg/kg mouse mAb did [22] . Based on this finding, the antibody dose and dosing frequency adopted in our study were within the range shown not to induce anaphylactic reaction. Because a human-mouse chimeric mAb, infliximab, is repeatedly administered to humans at doses of 3 or 5 mg/kg, and mouse mAb 2-4 exhibited a therapeutic effect at 3 mg/ kg in FIP cats, the doses used in the present study were set based on these findings [8, 10, 11] . Experiments to confirm whether or not an anaphylactic reaction is induced by highdose repeated administration are warranted.",

It is known that single administration of an anti-fTNF-alpha drug is unlikely to exhibit a therapeutic effect on cats with FIP; thus, several administrations of mAb 2-4 are necessary for treatment. However, several administrations of mouse mAb may induce anaphylactic reactions, as described above. Moreover, mouse mAb is a xenogeneic protein for cats, suggesting that a feline anti-mouse antibody response is induced in cats treated with mouse mAb 2-4, decreasing the reactivity against fTNF-alpha and thus reducing the therapeutic effect. The possibility of feline anti-chimeric antibody production similar to the production of anti-mouse mAb 2-4 antibody cannot be ruled out due to the variable region of chimeric mAb 2-4 being derived from mouse protein.",

As the feline anti-mouse antibody was increased in serum, the fTNF-alpha neutralization effect of mAb 2-4 was reduced in cats treated with mouse mAb 2-4 and 5 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2-4. That is, no neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2-4 induction was observed in cats treated with 1 mg/ kg chimeric mAb 2-4, suggesting that feline anti-mouse antibody induction was prevented by modifying mouse mAb 2-4 to chimeric mAb 2-4. Accordingly, repeated administration of chimeric mAb 2-4 may not decrease the therapeutic effect in cats. However, in cats receiving 5 mg/kg chimeric mAb 2-4 administration, the neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2-4 was induced after the 2nd administration, strongly suggesting that chimeric mAb 2-4 also induces production of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb 2-4 when administered at a high dose. A decrease in the therapeutic effect of infliximab due to production of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb has similarly been reported [7] . However, neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb production can be inhibited by concomitant administration of an anti-inflammatory drug, methotrexate (MTX). MTX suppresses the humoral immune response and is thought to reduce production of antibody against chimeric mAb after infliximab administration [10, 11] . Concomitant MTX administration with chimeric mAb 2-4 may also inhibit production of neutralizing antibody against chimeric mAb. Future studies are necessary to investigate the applicability of concomitant MTX administration with chimeric mAb 2-4 in cats with FIP.",
