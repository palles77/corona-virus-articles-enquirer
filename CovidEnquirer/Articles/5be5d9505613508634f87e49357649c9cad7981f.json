We obtain the maximum instantaneous population of infected nodes and the maximum population of ever infected nodes through simulation. We find that generally more balanced load distribution leads to more intense and wide spread of an epidemic in networks. Increasing either average node degree or homogeneity of degree distribution will facilitate epidemic spreading. When packet generation rate \u03c1 is small, increasing \u03c1 favors epidemic spreading. However, when \u03c1 is large enough, traffic congestion appears which inhibits epidemic spreading.",

For instance, outbreaks of many infectious diseases, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS), Swine flu (H1N1), and the recent Ebola virus, caused great damage and loss of life. The spread of computer and mobile phone viruses brought about a great deal trouble to human life and serious damage to economy. Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of those spreading processes and designing efficient control strategies become very important and urgent tasks, which bring together a lot of researchers from areas of biology, sociology, mathematics, physics, engineering, etc. [3] .",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading has a long history of more than two hundred years [4] . Generally, the population is divided into several classes: susceptible, infected and recovered individuals. Susceptible individuals represent those who can contract the infection. Infected individuals were previously susceptible individuals and got infected by the disease. Recovered individuals are those who have recovered from the infection. In the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model [4] , infected individuals can recover from the disease and become susceptible individuals again. While in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [4] , infected individuals no longer get infected after recovery from the disease, which are assumed to get the permanent immunity. In classical epidemiology, a common assumption is that individuals in a class are treated similarly, and have equal probability to contact with everyone else [3, 4] . However, the recent abundance of data demonstrates that both the connectivity pattern and the contact rate are heterogeneous among real-world complex networks [3, 5] , which means the traditional deterministic differential equations and many other related results of epidemic processes are inadequate in real-world situations. This greatly stimulates the research of epidemics on real-world complex networks [4] . Due to the complexity of real-world networks, the mean-field approach [6] [7] [8] and the generating function approach [9] are used to drive the analytic results of epidemics spreading. One of the remarkable results obtained by Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [4, 6] shows that in the limit of a network of infinite size, the epidemic threshold of the SIS model tends to zero asymptotically in scale-free networks with power-law parameter in (2, 3] . For SIR model, it was found that in the thermodynamic limit, not only the threshold tends to vanish, but also the time for the stabilization of the infection becomes very small [10, 11] . By using the message-passing approach, Karrer and Newman [12] calculated the probabilities for any node and any time to be in state S, I, and R on tree structure. Many other explicit results of SIR model are obtained by mapping the SIR model to the percolation process [9, 13, 14] . Also, effects of degree correlations [15] , clustering [16, 17] , weights and directions of edges [7, 18, 19] on epidemic spreading are broadly discussed. On the other hand, various efficient immunization protocols [4, 20, 21] have been designed for controlling the spread of epidemics on networks. Recently much attention has been transferred to epidemic spreading in temporal and multiplex networks [22] [23] [24] .",

Epidemic spreading is often coupled with the delivery of these substances. For example, HIV spreads through the exchange of body fluids among individuals in contact networks. Computer viruses spread with the delivery of information packets in computer networks. Flu often spreads by air traffics among different spatial areas. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of these coupled spreading processes and how these processes affect each other is significant for designing efficient epidemic immunization strategies. Meloni et al. [25] first studied the effects of traffic flow on epidemic spreading. They found that the epidemic threshold in the SIS model decreases as flow increases, and emergence of traffic congestion slows down the spread of epidemics. Then, Yang et al. [26, 27] further studied the relation between traffic dynamics and the SIS epidemic model, and found that the epidemic can be controlled by fine tuning the local or global routing schemes. Furthermore, they obtained that the epidemic threshold can be enhanced by cutting some specific edges in the network [28] . The impacts of traffic dynamics on SIR epidemic model have not been reported in literature. We study the traffic-driven SIR spreading dynamics in complex networks. We focus on the instantaneous size of infected population, and the final size of ever infected population. Based on these two properties, we study how the packets transmission process governed by given routing protocols affects the epidemic spreading.",

Every node generates packets at a rate \u03c1. For example if \u03c1 = 1.5, each time an arbitrary node generates one packet definitely and another one with probability 0.5. The destination nodes of the packets are chosen randomly, and the packets will be removed from the network after arriving at the destination nodes.

When \u03b1 > 0, paths with large-degree nodes usually have large routing costs. Thus, efficient paths tend to be those paths composed of small-degree nodes when \u03b1 > 0, and vice versa. Each time a node can deliver at most C packets. When C = \u221e, all the packets can be delivered without delay, there is no traffic congestion. The overall load of the network is constant after a short transient time. When C is a constant value, there is a critical packet generation rate \u03c1 c . When \u03c1 < \u03c1 c , there is no traffic congestion. When \u03c1 > \u03c1 c , the network generates more packets than it can deliver. As a result, the overall load of the network increases with time, which is the traffic congestion phenomenon. We use the order parameter to characterize the traffic congestion, which is as follows [30] : where w(t) is the total number of packets in the network at time t. When \u03c8 = 0, the generated and delivered packets are balanced, and the network is under the free flow state. When \u03c8 > 0, packets accumulate continuously in the network, which indicates that there exists traffic congestion.",

With the delivery of these infection packets, more and more susceptible nodes get infected after receiving the infection packets. Infected nodes get recovered and become recovered nodes with probability \u00b5 at each time step. Recovered nodes generate normal packets, and they can also make the infection packets into normal packets. Thus, recovered nodes block the epidemic spreading.

In Fig. 5 , we see that the peak of R e for \u03c1 = 0.5 is almost 4 times of the peak of R e for \u03c1 = 0.2. The peak of I p for \u03c1 = 0.5 is almost 6 times of the peak of I p for \u03c1 = 0.2. Also the positions of the peaks for \u03c1 = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 are different. In Fig. 6(a) , we clearly see both the maximum I p and the maximum R e increase with \u03c1. When \u03c1 becomes large, infected nodes will generate more infected packets, which facilitates the epidemic spreading. In Fig. 6(b) , we see that \u03b1 opt decreases with \u03c1, which indicates an increase of dependency on largedegree nodes. To illustrate this, we focus on the top 1% largest degree nodes, and calculate the average ratio \u03b7 of the number a b c d e f of infection packets a large degree node delivered when it was infected to the number of infection packets it cured after it recovered. In Fig. 7 , \u03b7 increases with \u03c1, which means that the role large-degree nodes play in facilitating the epidemic spreading becomes more and more remarkable compared to the role they play in inhibiting the epidemic spreading. This explains why the epidemic spreading becomes more dependent on large-degree nodes to spread widely when \u03c1 increases as shown in Fig. 6(b) . ",

In Fig. 8(a) and (c), we see that the maximum I p and the maximum R e increase with average degree \u27e8k\u27e9 for both random networks and scale-free networks. This indicates that more edges facilitate the epidemic spreading. In Fig. 8(b) and (d), \u03b1 opt decreases with \u27e8k\u27e9, but is large than zero. This means that, to realize an intense and wide epidemic spreading, generally the paths for the delivery of infection packets should be biased towards including small-degree nodes, but when the network becomes dense, the degree of the dependence of large-degree nodes in the transmission of infection packets should be increased accordingly. Then we show the impacts of power-law parameter \u03b3 on the epidemic spreading in Fig. 9 . Both the maximum I p and the maximum R e increase with \u03b3 first, and then tend to be stable. The \u03b1 opt increases slightly with \u03b3 . We infer from Fig. 9 that homogeneous network structure facilitates the epidemic spreading.",

In the simulation, C is set to 10, \u03c8 is calculated according to Eq. (2) to quantify the degree of a b traffic congestion. In Fig. 10(a) , we see that only when \u03b1 is in [0.6, 1], there is no traffic congestion in the network, which is indicated by \u03c8 = 0. Otherwise, there exists traffic congestion where \u03c8 > 0. In Fig. 10(b) , we see that both I p and R e increase with \u03b1 first, and then decrease with \u03b1. The optimal \u03b1 for I p and R e are 0.7 and 0.9 respectively, where there is no traffic congestion. Also, we obtain that when the traffic congestion is not serious like \u03b1 in [1.5, 2] ( Fig. 10(a) ), the epidemic spreading can still spread intensely and widely, which is inferred by I p and R e in Fig. 10(b) . Then we fix \u03b1 to be zero, and study how the maximum I p and the maximum R e vary with \u03c1. In Fig. 11 , we obtain that both the maximum I p and the maximum R e increase first and then decrease with \u03c1, which is consistent for both random networks and scale-free networks. The reason for these results is that when \u03c1 is small, there is no traffic congestion, and the infection becomes intense and wide spread with increase of \u03c1. However, when \u03c1 is large enough, traffic congestion appears, which inhibits the epidemic spreading.",

There are also optimal \u03b1 which correspond to the maximum I p and the maximum R e respectively.

We find that the epidemic spreading is greatly affected by the load distribution, and homogeneous load distribution facilitates the epidemic spreading. Increasing the network density or network homogeneity will enhance the epidemic spreading. Large-degree nodes have dual effects on the epidemic spreading, since large-degree infected nodes facilitate the epidemic spreading, while large-degree recovered nodes greatly inhibit the epidemic spreading. To realize an intense and wide epidemic spreading, the paths for the delivery of packets are generally biased towards including small-degree nodes. Increasing packet generation rate generally favors the epidemic spreading. However, when the amount of generated packets is larger than the delivery capacity of the network, there will exit traffic congestion, which blocks the epidemic spreading. Also, we find similar impacts of different static routing protocols on the traffic-driven SIR epidemic spreading. Our work helps understanding the interplay between traffic dynamics and epidemic spreading, and provides some clues for network immunization.",
