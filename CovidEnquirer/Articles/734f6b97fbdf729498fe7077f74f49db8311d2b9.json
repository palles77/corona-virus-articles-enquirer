            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is considered to be a new viral epidemic, and the infection is associated with acute respiratory illness and renal failure. 1, 2 In September 2012, this coronavirus was discovered and isolated from an infected patient living in Saudi Arabia. 1 The geographic distribution of cases has been mainly confined to six countries in the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, and Oman). However, in some countries in Europe and Africa, instances of the disease have been detected in imported cases from endemic countries. MERS-CoV has a very high mortality rate, and complications arising from infection can result in severe respiratory and renal failure. 4 The mode of transmission and the source of MERS-CoV infection (ie, whether it is a zoonotic or human disease) is unclear. 4 Recent research has shown that dromedaries may act as viral reservoirs, and antibodies against MERS-CoV have been found in dromedaries living in both the African and Arabian peninsulas. 5, 6 Despite limited data on MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, we have attempted to explore the epidemiological distribution of and describe the pattern of infection of this disease by conducting a study of the reports of MERS-CoV published daily by the Saudi Ministry of Health. 7",

It has been documented that people over 65 years of age and younger people with chronic diseases are at a greater risk of complications resulting from influenza or viral infections than are healthy adults. This indicates that older and unhealthy younger people are more likely to become infected with MERS-CoV, owing to a weak immune system, and infection is more likely to be fatal in these groups. 10 Our study also reports that the region of Riyadh had the highest rate of MERS-CoV infections and deaths in However, despite the high number of cases and deaths in Riyadh and Jeddah, the case fatality rate was highest in the Eastern Region, and for this reason, MERS-CoV was first discovered here. In Jeddah and Mecca, there is concern about the increase of MERS-CoV cases because hundreds of thousands of people frequently travel to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah and Hajj. Although no Hajj-associated MERS-CoV cases have been reported, Umrah-associated cases have. [11] [12] [13] Therefore, the World Health Organization suggests that governments should provide advice on the risk of infection to pilgrims with major medical problems, such as chronic diseases. In addition, general travel health information should be provided, including advice on food safety practices, good personal hygiene, and avoiding unnecessary farm visits and contact with animals. 14 We have observed that MERS-CoV incidence rates are higher in environments with low relative humidity (\ue02c20%) and high temperatures (20\u00b0C-35\u00b0C). Therefore, increasing relative humidity to above 35% and maintaining temperatures ranging 5\u00b0C-15\u00b0C in hospitals and indoor places may decrease the spread of this disease. However, it has been observed that higher relative humidity levels above 43% may decrease the activity of influenza virus particles to 14%, while a relative humidity of 23% or less may increase the activity of influenza virus particles from 70%-77%. 15 The source of infection should also be investigated and identified with epidemiological surveillance, either passively or actively, in order to control MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.",

The rates of MERS-CoV cases and deaths are higher in men than in women, and those in the age groups of 45-59 and \ue02460 years had the highest case fatality rate. Furthermore, Riyadh, Jeddah, and the Eastern Region had the highest number of cases and related deaths in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV is most active in environments with low relative humidity and high temperatures. However, further epidemiological studies are required to determine the source and the mode of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. ",
