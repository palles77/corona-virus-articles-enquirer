In this paper we present a model-based approach allowing the estimation of the functional link between the survival probability and a time-varying covariate when data are grouped and time-period censored. The approach is based on an underlying model consisting in non-stationary Markov processes and describing the survival of individuals. The underlying model is aggregated in time and at the group level to handle the group structure of data and the censoring. The aggregation yields a generalized non-linear mixed model. Then, a Bayesian procedure allows the estimation of the model parameters and the description of the link between the survival probability and the time-varying covariate This approach is applied in order to explore the relationship between the daily survival probability of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and their time-varying lengths (small mosquitofish die with a higher rate than large ones because they are more affected by predation, cannibalism and environmental stress).",

Other examples arise in prey-predator systems. Indeed, the survival probability of preys may be affected for instance by (i) the time-varying count of predators, (ii) the time-varying count of preys, (iii) the time-varying size of preys. In the case of infectious diseases, the probability for an individual to stay healthy may be affected by the count of infectious individuals at the date before (autoregressive process). In social science, the probability for an individual to stay a student may be affected by the time-varying policy of the government.",

But collecting daily data and repeating the measures a large number of days may not be possible. Indeed, each measure may be time and money consuming, and may affect the survival of individuals. That is the reason why, instead of daily measures, one can choose to carry out for several groups of individuals a few measures separated by several days, e.g. one initial measure plus a few additional measures. To get data corresponding to a large range of the time-varying covariate, the groups have to be sampled for different ranges of the covariate. Such a structure for the data generates two problems: (i) the observations are time-period (or interval) censored and (ii) there may be group effects. These two points should be taken into account when a statistical analysis of the data is performed.",

This model, still under construction in research units of the National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA, France), is being developed to carry out studies in ecotoxicology (mosquitofish is an experimental animal commonly used in ecotoxicology; see for instance [5, 9, 10, 15, 24] ). A first version of the individual-based model, presented in [12] , describes at a daily time step the early stages of the establishment of a mosquitofish population.

The mesocosms consisted of circular metal tanks (3.0 m diameter, 0.6 m height) filled with various elements for building fish habitats. In January, the tanks were lined up with polyethylene film (0.2 mm thick), filled with tap water (water depth: 45 cm), and sediments were introduced at a uniform layer (about 5 cm thick). The tanks then sat for a few months to allow for phyto-and zoo-plankton as well as macroinvertebrates to naturally settle in the tanks. In April, pieces of Ludwigia peploide were introduced into the mesocosms. Then, at different times in the summer, groups of mosquitofish were introduced in the mesocosms, one group per mesocosm, and nets with small mesh were installed to protect the fish from bird predation.",

For 6 groups (i P 33 in Table  1 ), fish were captured, counted, measured for length and released in the mesocosms two or three times. Such an experimental procedure is particularly time-consuming because, as mosquitofish survival can be affected by the stress of captures, fish must be captured and manipulated with care. That is the reason why, for 32 other groups (i 6 32 in Table 1 ), fish were captured, counted, measured for length only one time after their introduction in the mesocosms. Forty six captures were done in total for the 38 groups of fish. For each capture we know: the mesocosm and the duration in days since the last capture (or fish introduction), the initial and final fish counts, and the initial and final mean fish lengths (see Table 1 ).",

For instance, instead of the occurrence of the death of a mosquitofish, consider the occurrence of a transmissible disease affecting humans (e.g. AIDS, SARS), animals (e.g. avian flu) or plants (e.g. wheat rusts), and suppose one aims to link the DSP (the time step of interest can be different from the day) with the time-varying intensity of prevention measures for example. In such a context, assumption A 2 is clearly not suitable. Indeed, the ''survival'' process of an individual can affect the ''survival'' processes of other individuals since the disease is transmissible.

The horizontal dashed lines are at quantiles 0.05 and 0.95 of the normal distribution (if fish counts are large,r i;k approximately have centered normal distributions with variance equal to one). The residual plot in the right panel suggests that the explanatory variable, i.e. the fish length, should be transformed. Contrastively, the residual plot in the left panel does not suggest such a transformation.

This plot shows that the DSP quickly increases with the fish length and once fish are larger than about 15 mm, their DSP is constant up to the mesocosm effect.The estimate gb will be incorporated in the individual-based model mentioned in the introduction. The present study also provides insight into how to analyze the sensibility of the model output with respect to b (one of the aims of the individual-based model is to see how variations of mosquitofish life history traits (described by parameters in the model) influence population dynamics (i.e. model output)). We saw inFig. 2that the MCMC runs for b 2 and b 3 are strongly dependent. The sensiblity analysis should account for this dependence. The linear regression model b 3 = 0.75 \u00c0 0.52 log(\u00c0b 2 ) fitted to the MCMC runs reflects quite well the dependence (R 2 = 0.98). Thus, the sensibility of the model with respect to the components of b can be performed with b 1 approximately varying in [6.9, 7.3], b 2 in [\u00c01000,\u00c0200] and b 3 satisfying the equation given above.4.4. Illustration: paths of the count of surviving fishTo better understand the behavior of the fitted model, we simulated paths of the count of surviving fish.
