Palivizumab is currently licensed for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children with CLD, with a history of preterm birth or with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. 4 It is given monthly by injection during the RSV season and is usually continued for five months in the Northern Hemisphere. However, routine or outbreak use in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is not currently recommended. 5 Here we report an outbreak of RSV which affected 15 hospitalised infants in our NICU, identified at an early stage by rapid testing and controlled by palivizumab prophylaxis and infection control measures.",

Following this, all infants in the NICU were screened, revealing two more cases: these infants were initially asymptomatic (cases 6 and 10) but developed respiratory symptoms within 24-48 h. The 37 remaining premature infants in the NICU, all of whom were <34 weeks' gestational age at birth, were given palivizumab prophylaxis (administered i.m. at 15 mg/ kg) within a few hours of detection of the index cases. The diagnosis of RSV was subsequently confirmed in all 13 cases by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Surveillance testing for RSV was repeated using Respi-Strip every 48 h until all of the infected infants became negative. Infants who tested negative with Respi-Strip were tested again if they became symptomatic on follow-up. Two days after palivizumab administration, RSV was detected in one additional infant (case 4) who had become symptomatic. Another infant (case 7), whose clinical picture was suggestive of RSV infection but who tested negative by Respi-Strip, was subsequently found to be positive by PCR. Besides RSV, patients were tested by PCR for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, coronavirus 63/43, metapneumovirus and rhinovirus, and screened for bacterial sepsis by blood culture.",

The virus can survive on hard surfaces for up to 7 h and remains detectable after 30 min on cloth, paper, and stethoscopes. 6 The use of palivizumab for the control of nosocomial RSV outbreaks has been previously reported by Kurz et al., who successfully prevented an outbreak of RSV in a NICU following the detection of a case. 7 Halasa et al. described an RSV outbreak involving nine infected infants. 8 Standard infection control measures plus administration of palivizumab to the 49 remaining infants in the NICU were implemented, and no new cases were detected thereafter. Abadesso et al. analysed two RSV outbreaks: although standard infection control measures were effective in the first, five additional infants were infected during a single month in the second. 9 Immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab was administered to all of the infants in the NICU and the authors concluded that this helped to prevent an uncontrolled RSV outbreak in their NICU. Cox et al. reported an outbreak of RSV involving seven premature infants. 10 Palivizumab was given to eight high-risk preterm infants and no additional cases occurred. Fifteen cases of RSV were diagnosed in our NICU, all of which involved patients aged <35 weeks' gestation. Premature infants are highly susceptible to RSV disease because they have smaller airways, their immune systems are immature, and they have low levels of maternally acquired RSV-specific antibodies. 2 Diagnosis of RSV is largely based on clinical findings, but can also be based on virus isolation, detection of viral antigens or viral RNA, demonstration of a rise in serum antibodies or a combination of these approaches. 1 We used the Respi-Strip RSV rapid antigen test kit, which requires only two reagents (extraction buffer and the immunostrips) and two incubations. It is technically easy to perform, fast (the results were available within 25 min) and accurate (sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98%). 11 The cost of Respi-Strip is much lower than that of PCR (V4.6 vs V136 per patient). Since early detection and implementation of infection control measures are important for outbreak control, rapid antigen testing represents an accurate, fast, and practical method for the diagnosis of RSV infection. Only one infant with negative Respi-Strip test had positive RSV PCR. The remaining infants with negative Respi-Strip test did not develop clinically suspected RSV infection although they were not tested with PCR. Therefore we believe that the sensitivity and specificity of Respi-Strip test are acceptable. However, it should be remembered that the test performance might be affected by the high incidence of the disease during an outbreak and may be lower when used for routine screening.",

Therefore we decided to give palivizumab to the remaining unaffected high-risk infants in our NICU, even though this is not routinely recommended by current guidelines. We also implemented additional measures including isolation of the positive cases, contact precautions, limitation of visitors and closure to elective admissions. It is difficult to distinguish which, if any, of these interventions altered the course of the outbreak. However, given the high control rate in this study, and previous experience with palivizumab, we believe that palivizumab contributed to the favourable outcome. We detected RSV in two additional patients within 48 h of the administration of palivizumab. This may be explained by false-negativity of the Respi-Strip test during the screening period before palivizumab administration, or ineffectiveness of palivizumab in these patients.",

The prognosis is somewhat unfavourable and fatal infections may be seen. 13, 14 Seven of our patients required mechanical ventilation, and five with clinical and radiological findings of ARDS died. Severe RSV infections resulting in ARDS with a mortality rate of 40-70% have been reported in the literature. 15 All seven infants who were intubated were born at <31 weeks of gestation, showing that prematurity also negatively affects the course of the disease.",
