The potential anti-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) activity of the POMs [a-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7\u00c0 isomers was investigated in this paper by molecular modeling method. The SARS 3c like protease, namely the SARS 3CL pro is the key function protease for virus replication as well as transcription and thus can be taken as one of the key targets for anti-SARS drug design. Affinity/ Insight II was used to explore possible binding locations for POMs/3CL pro interaction. Charges in the POMs were obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) method. The results show that POMs bind with 3CL pro in the active site region with high affinity; POMs are more prone to bind with 3CL pro than with some organic compounds; for the POMs/3CL pro complex, the OTi 2 in POMs is the vital element for electrostatic interaction, and the electrostatic binding energy is strong enough to keep the complex stable.",

They conduct almost all functions needed during the course of virus replication as well as transcription. Polypeptides with different functions are mostly produced from these two polypeptides and this kind of crack procedure is just mainly dependent on the 3CL pro [3, 4] . The catalytically active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro has been shown to be Cys145/His41 [2, 6, 7] , which is conserved in this protein.

In particular, the sizes and globular structural motifs of many POMs are similar, and in some cases nearly identical to some water-soluble fullerene derivatives showing fairly good anti-HIV-1P activity [11] . Liu and her co-workers have investigated POMs compounds such as PW, SiW, PMo, and SiMo.

Many papers report that Ti-containing a-Keggin POMs show obvious inhibition activity to HIV-1 [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . It is very significant to explore the inhibition potency of a-Keggin POMs to SARS-CoV. Firstly, whether POMs interact with the SARS main functional protease of 3CL pro ; secondly, what the interaction mechanism should be; and above all, it is of great significance to explore molecular mechanism and molecular dynamics mechanism when studying problems related to POMs. In this investigation, the a-Keggin type POM isomers including [a-1,5-PTi 2 W 10 7\u00c0 were selected as candidates for SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. Binding energy was compared, hydrogen bonds formation and electrostatic interaction were analyzed, active site key residues were identified and the interaction mechanism was also discussed at molecular level.",

However, the general interaction position of POMs with 3CL pro should not change because it was based on energy difference instead of the absolute values. An assumption made in this study was that neither the enzyme nor the inhibitors undergo major structural changes on binding.

Where ''D'' represents energy difference originated from steric hindrance between POMs and 3CL pro , ''D 1 '' represents electrostatic energy changing of the complex, and ''D 2 '' is the total energy changing. As is shown in the results that, for all these five ligand-receptor complexes, the electrostatic energy (D 1 ) both decrease remarkably, which indicates that the highly negative charged POM inhibitors interact with the 3CL pro and therefore cause electrostatic energy to decrease. Furthermore, the electrostatic interaction is strong enough to overcome the unfavorable steric effects, therefore results in total negative energy (D 2 ) in all the five complexes. Binding energy is an important criterion for reliable virtual screening. Several researches have performed virtual screening study of SARS-CoV 3CL pro using small molecular like AG7088 as reference molecule [35, 36] . As is shown in our investigation that, binding energy of POM/3CL pro complex is much higher than that of some small organic molecules. This indicates that POMs may even more prone to bind with 3CL pro than small organic molecules. What is more, an important conclusion can be drawn from our study is that, the total binding energies of the five complex systems follow the order of 1,2-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,4-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,5-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,6-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,11-PTi 2 /3CL pro , which can provide perfectly well interpretation on the relative stability of the five POM/3CL pro complexes.",

Moreover, it is clearly shown that the OTi 2 of POMs contributes much to hydrogen bond formation within all the five ligand-receptor complexes. Our former DFT calculation have shown that in these POM isomers, the charge loading of OTi 2 is much stronger than that of other bridging oxygen and terminal oxygen. That should be the reason why the two systems of the 1,2-PTi 2 /3CL pro complexes and the 1,4-PTi 2 /3CL pro complex are much more stable than the others. It should be noticed that there are only six hydrogen bonds in 1,11-PTi 2 /3CL pro and the terminal oxygen also attends hydrogen bonds formation. Our quantum chemistry calculation also proved that the charge loading of the terminal oxygen is smaller than that of OW 2 .
