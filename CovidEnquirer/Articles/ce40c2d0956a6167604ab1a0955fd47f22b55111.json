Recently, the sequence variations of SARS-CoV during the first epidemic phases in China in 2003 were reported. The neutral mutation rate for SARS-CoV was almost constant and similar to that of known RNA viruses; the S protein, responsible for virus-host receptor recognition, displayed the most extensive amino acid changes (13) . In addition, the sequence analysis of isolates from recent SARS patients in China in 2004 has shown that 98.8%-99.4% of the 3,768 bases of S gene, 99% of 658 bases of M gene, and 99% of 1,068 bases of N gene are isogenous with those submitted to public databases, which date back to the first epidemic in spring 2003 (14) . However, even these minimal changes could render existing PCR assays ineffective should SARS-CoV reemerge (15) .",

            "text": "To improve the ability to detect SARS-CoV safely and reduce the risk of eliciting false-negative results caused by genome sequence variations, we established three individual real-time RT-PCR assays. Target sequences were chosen by using the following criteria: 1) the regions are distributed over the whole genome, including the nonstructural polyprotein 1a and 1ab genes and the spike glycoprotein gene (Table 1) ; 2) the regions are highly conserved among the 89, 90, and 100 respective sequences available in public sequence databases; 3) the regions are suitable for the design of a real-time RT-PCR assay; and 4) the designed primers, 5\u2032-nuclease probes, and amplicons displayed no considerable homology to other viruses, including human CoV OC43 and 229E in BLAST searches (available from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). These assays were based on the fluorogenic oligoprobe chemistry, which uses the 5\u2032-exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase to generate a more specific signal than that produced by the use of SYBR Green I (8) . The realtime RT-PCR assays were successfully run on the Applied Biosystems real-time PCR systems (SDS7700 and SDS7000; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as well as on the Roche LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). All assays were designed as onestep RT-PCR reactions to be run under identical conditions on the respective PCR platform. This system allowed the simultaneous detection of different SARS-CoV regions in a single PCR run. Moreover, we could combine the three assays in a single tube, which might be important when clinical material is limited. Finally, the assays were compared to the 5\u2032-nuclease assay published recently (5) and to a commercially available real-time PCR kit (Real-Art HPA-Coronavirus LC RT PCR Reagents, Artus GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).",

Results are shown in Table 2 . Detection limits of the three new assays were <10 GE. Comparison of the threshold cycle (C T ) values showed that the new assays were at least as sensitive as the previously described assays (5, 8) and the commercially available kit. When we combined the assays in a single tube targeting three different regions on the same RNA template, the C T was reduced by 1 to 2 cycles (SDS7700), which suggests either that sensitivity was unchanged or, when there was an increase, that it was attributable to the combination of all three signals (LightCycler). Subsequent agarose gel analysis during optimization steps of the PCR confirmed the simultaneous amplification of the three RT-PCR products (Figure, online only; available from: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no7/03-0678-G.htm).",

All samples were positive for L13 and cyclophilin control sequences when amplified in parallel. In agreement with the previously published assay results (5), SARS-CoV was detectable in three samples from eight probable SARS patients, without explicit differences in the C T value of individual assays when the single or combined assays were used. These patients were seropositive and are regarded as confirmed SARS patients. Respiratory samples and stool samples taken 8 days later from the remaining 5 probable patients as well as the 19 persons with suspected disease were negative by RT-PCR. Moreover, these patients remained seronegative and are regarded as unconfirmed SARS patients. In addition, 35 serum samples from patients with SARS-CoV infection obtained 1-52 days after disease onset were analyzed. Between 20 and 1,000 GE/mL of SARS-CoV-specific RNA was detected in 21 of 35 serum samples, even when serum was obtained from patients 1 day after disease onset.

For these pathogens, we obtained neither a fluorescent signal nor an amplification product in subsequent agarose gel analysis (selection shown in online Figure) . Although we focused on a one-step RT-PCR to decrease handling and total assay time, the three real-time RT-PCR assays can also be performed as two-step RT-PCR, including a separate cDNA synthesis step followed by PCR, and then finally using appropriate ready-to-use master mixes and the same cycling condition, omitting the RT step.",

Parallel amplification of two human reference genes, L13 and cyclophilin, confirmed negative results in clinical samples by demonstrating amplifiable RNA. The separation of the control reaction was chosen to guarantee the high sensitivity of the SARS-CoV detection of <10 GE of SARS-CoV per reaction. An RT-PCR run is completed in <1 h, depending on the real-time PCR platform. In cases of small amounts of material or in an emergency situation with a high throughput of samples, the three SARS-CoVspecific assays can be combined into one RT-PCR reaction without loss of sensitivity. Furthermore, as the ambiguous diagnostic results in a hospital in Canada have recently shown (17) , targeting three different regions distributed over the whole genome considerably reduces the risk for false-negative results caused by virus sequence modifications.
