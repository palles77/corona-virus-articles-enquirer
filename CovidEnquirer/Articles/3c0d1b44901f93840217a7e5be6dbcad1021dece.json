Many experts argue that a sudden change in air pressure will cause hysteria. When the author has encountered this disease, the birds have usually been raised in a filtered-air, positive-pressure facility. b. Clinical Signs and Lesions. Escherichia coli may be a primary infectious agent; clinical onset is rapid and daily mor tality can approach 0.5-1.0%. The usual lesions noted are air sacculitis, fibrinous pericarditis, and fibrinous perihepatitis. Rarely is the trachea involved. Col\u00eegranuloma (Hjarre's dis ease) may be caused by a pathogenic E. coli serotype. Avian tuberculosis may be confused with colibacillosis. Granulomas of the intestine are differentiated from tuberculosis by the use of the acid-fast stain. Escherichia coli, of course, is not acid fast. Other lesions caused by E. coli include arthritis leading to lameness and death, navel infection leading to high mortality, and foot pad infections.",

If an air sacculitis syndrome develops, with no isolation of Pasteur ella sp., Mycoplasma sp., or Hemophilus sp., it is essential to consider E. coli as the potential pathogen. Isolations of E. coli from yolk sacs, joints, or bone marrow should always be considered a primary cause of disease. e. Prevention. Good management of the chicks must in clude proper ventilation and the proper care of hatching eggs. This is the most important means of preventing navel ill.

Marek's disease is caused by a herpesvirus. This virus produces inflammatory and neoplastic changes in the CNS, various peripheral nerves, skin, and visceral organs.b. Clinical Signs. Since Marek's disease may affect any organ system of the body, signs are variable. Paralysis of the wings and legs are common. A gray eye with irregular pupil size is a feature of the ocular form of Marek's disease. Feather follicles of the skin from the leg and breast region are swollen.",

Mycoplasma gallisepticumand M. synoviae-free stock should always be purchased when available. A low level antibiotic fed continuously will prevent the severe clinical signs and lesions of this disease, but will not eliminate M. synoviae. g. Treatment. It appears that tetracyclines are effective as a treatment with most isolates of M. synoviae, but a few isolates are resistant to the tetracyclines and respond to treatment with furazolidone.h.

It is an obligate intracellular organism and can be grown in chick embryos, cell culture, mice and guinea pigs. The host range is wide and includes turkeys, ducks, pigeons, parrots, parakeets, cockatoos, and macaws. Humans are highly suscep tible to infection with avian chlamydial agents (See Chapter 22 byFox et al.).",
