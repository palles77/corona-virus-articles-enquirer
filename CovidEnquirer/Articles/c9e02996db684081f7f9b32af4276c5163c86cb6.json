The study was not controlled and the PEF meters used were not data logging or coded so there may have been a potential for incorrect recording. The patients we studied were volunteers attending a secondary centre for management of asthma and therefore may not be a representative sample of stable asthmatics. Furthermore one-third of subjects had been vaccinated previously and this may have introduced bias in that they may have been self selected as not to have had a bad response. Nevertheless the patients displayed a wide range of asthma severity with morning pre-bronchodilator PEF percentage of predicted ranging from 20% to 103%; and eight patients were maintained on oral steroids. Inoculation of killed influenza vaccine did not cause exacerbations in this group of patients with stable asthma. This is in agreement with previous observa-tions7, but contrasts with the findings of a study undertaken by Bell et ~1.'. We examined the possibility that clinically significant deterioration in symptoms, or lung function and increased need for medication occurs during the first l-2 days after immunization, and that comparisons of data over a longer period mask these changes. We found no support for such an explanation in our study.",

The association between respiratory viruses and exacerbation of asthma is well established1,2. However, we fai!ed to identify any respiratory viral pathogen in this case. This may have been because of the interval between onset of symptoms and sampling. However, we can not exclude an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Clearly a large placebo-controlled study is needed to demonstrate that adverse pulmonary reactions to the vaccine, if they occur, occur less frequently than the pulmonary function abnormalities that would be expected during an average winter in the absence of influenza vaccine.",
