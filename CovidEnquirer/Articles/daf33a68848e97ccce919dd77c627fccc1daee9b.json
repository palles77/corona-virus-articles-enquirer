Currently, there is no specific treatment for their infections. RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), which represents a possible therapeutic application for the treatment of viral infections. In this study, three siRNA expression plasmids (pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC) were generated to target three different coding regions of the Rep protein (Rep) of PCV. These siRNAs were used to inhibit PCV production in a porcine kidney cell line, PK-15 cells. Our results revealed that Rep gene expression was inhibited by pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC to different degrees. Moreover, our study also showed that the production of PCV1 and PCV2 was reduced by these siRNAs. pS-RepC, which targets the middle region of Rep gene, proved to be the most efficient siRNA for inhibition of Rep expression and viral production. Taken together, our data suggest that RNAi could be investigated as a potential treatment for PCV infection. #",

Both of them are presumed to be widespread in the swine population. Though PCV1 is considered to be nonpathogenic (Allan et al., 1995) , it can infect human leukocytes in vitro, and is now considered to be a potential risk for viral transmission when porcine tissues and organs are used for xenotransplantation (Arteaga-Troncoso et al., 2005) . PCV2 is associated www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 123 (2007) [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) (Clark, 1997; Harding and Clark, 1997) , porcine dermatitis, nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) (Rosell et al., 2000) . Furthermore, PCV2 may damage the immune system and induce immunosuppression, which results in other pathogenyes coinfection (Segales et al., 2004) . Although, vaccine for PCV2 has been developed recently, the efficiency still needs to be tested in the field trials. Thus, new method development for controlling PCV2 infection is urgently necessary.",

For PCV2, five Rep-associated RNAs (Rep, Rep 0 , Rep3a, Rep3b and Rep3c), and three NSassociated RNAs (NS515, NS672 and NS0), are synthesized during replication in PK-15 cells (Cheung, 2003a) . Two proteins derived from ORF1, the full-length (Rep) and the spliced (Rep 0 ), are essential for PCV DNA replication (Mankertz and Hillenbrand, 2001) . It has been reported that muta-tions in Rep or truncated Rep 0 proteins of PCV2 can cause more than a 99% reduction in viral protein synthesis and completely shut down viral DNA replication (Cheung, 2003b) . It is, therefore, suggested that Rep or Rep 0 could be a target for inhibition of PCV replication.",

However, its molecular mechanism remained unclear until the 1990s, when an elegant work in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans showed that RNAi is an evolutionarily conserved gene-silencing mechanism (Fire et al., 1998) . The post-translational silencing of gene expression occurs in response to the introduction of homologous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into a cell. This phenomenon can result in highly specific suppression of gene expression. In the past few years, RNAi has become widely used as an experimental tool to analyze the function of genes and it represents a new feasible approach to develop effective antiviral treatments. RNAi antiviral therapy has been shown to inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (Capodici et al., 2002) , severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Wang et al., 2004) , influenza virus (Ge et al., 2004) and foot-and-mouth disease virus . Therefore, RNAi would accord- ingly serve as a new strategy for battling viral infections.",

In this study, we used the eukaryotic expression vector pRep1-EGFP/pRep2-EGFP as a reporting system to monitor the function of the siRNAs. Rep1 and Rep2 expression were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Our results revealed that pS-RepA, pS-RepB and pS-RepC specifically inhibited Rep expression and PCV production in PK-15 cells. Furthermore, we found that siRNAs which inhibited Rep expression can also decrease Cap protein expression in PCV infected cells. These results were in agreement with a recent study that found that shRNA could not only significantly reduce its corresponding mRNA level but inhibited other viral gene transcription as well (J. .

This indicates that the best target site seems to be close to the midpoint of the gene. Recently, siRNAs targeted against PCV2 infection in cells and mouse models were reported. The authors demonstrated that the siRNAs targeting the Rep gene of PCV2 at nts 624-642 was most effective (J. . In our previous study, we also found that two siRNAs targeting the middle sequence of NS1 more efficiently inhibited Japanese encephalitis virus replication in BHK-21 cells (X. . This phenomenon may be due to different positional accessibility caused by steric hindrance by a secondary or tertiary structure and/or protein binding (Yuan et al., 2005) . In addition, analysis of ORF1 of PCV2 has shown 83% nucleotide and 86% predicted protein homology with PCV1. It suggests that siRNAs targeting same sequence of Rep1 and Rep2 may be efficient for both PCV1 and PCV2.
