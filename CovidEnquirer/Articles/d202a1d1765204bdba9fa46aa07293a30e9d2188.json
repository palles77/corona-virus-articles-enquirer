However, little information is available about the targets of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses. This includes SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in SARS-CoV-2 that have high homology to the SARS-CoV virus. Parallel bioinformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for SARS-CoV-2. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are promising targets for immune recognition of SARS-CoV-2. These predictions can facilitate effective vaccine design against this virus of high priority.",

B cell epitope predictions were carried out using the SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and membrane glycoprotein sequences, which, as described above, were found to be the main protein targets for B cell responses to other coronaviruses. In parallel, we performed predictions for linear B cell epitopes with Bepipred 2.0 (Jespersen et al., 2017) and for conformational epitopes with Discotope 2.0 . Both prediction algorithms are available on the IEDB B cell prediction tool page (http://tools.iedb.org/main/bcell/). A full list of B cell epitope prediction results per amino acid position per protein is provided in Table S1 . Using Bepipred 2.0 and a cutoff of R0.55 (corresponding to a specificity cutoff of 80%) (Jespersen et al., 2017) , the surface glycoprotein had the highest number of predicted B cell epitopes, followed by membrane glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Table S2) . To predict and map conformational B cell epitopes, we used the recently submitted SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein structure (PDB: 6VSB). A list of surface glycoprotein amino acid positions having a high probability of being included in predicted B cell epitopes, based on analysis with the Discotope 2.0 algorithm, is shown in Table S1 (cutoff of R\u00c02.5, corresponding to 80% specificity). We then localized the relevant amino acid positions onto the model structure, which allowed the identification of seven predicted epitope residue/regions (491-505, 558-562, 703-704, 793-794, 810, 914, and 1140-1146) in the surface glycoprotein ( Figure 3 ).",

The approach we followed is based on establishing several lines of evidence that clearly pinpoint SARS-CoV as a relevant model to extrapolate likely targets of responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with COVID-19. The first line of evidence pertains to the fact that of coronaviruses known to infect humans, SARS-CoV is the most similar in phylogenetic terms to SARS-CoV-2. The second line of evidence is that SARS-CoV-2 is the most (and highly) similar to SARS-CoV at the level of sequence identity. Third, when we critically reviewed the knowledge related to the precise epitopes recognized by adaptive responses in the context of coronaviruses in aggregate, it was apparent that all but 2 of the 417 B and T cell epitopes described in humans to date are from Betacoronaviruses, with 398 of them coming from SARS-CoV.",

The two regions in the membrane protein have been shown to elicit marked IgM and IgG responses and a broad spectrum of recognition, highlighting them as potential diagnostic candidates (Chow et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2003) . Of the three regions identified in the nucleoprotein, 156-175 has shown strong reactivity against SARS patient sera and immunogenicity in multiple species, including mice, monkeys, and humans (Liu et al., 2006) . Because of the overall high level of sequence similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, we infer that the regions dominant in SARS-CoV have a high likelihood to also be dominant in SARS-CoV-2, even if the actual sequences are different. This hypothesis is in agreement with the recent cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, showing a high resemblance in the overall structure with the SARS-CoV spike protein (Wrapp et al., 2020) . In the same study, however, the authors do not observe cross-recognition of SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, they observed no reactivity with SARS-CoV antibodies that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 retains the same capability to bind the ACE2 receptor of SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al., 2020) . This suggests that the B cell prediction performed on the RBD domain will require further studies.",

When examining the homologous regions of SARS-CoV, it has been found that the likely T cell epitopes are positive in assays such as ELISPOT, intra-cellular staining (ICS), and multimer/tetramer staining (see, e.g., Cheung et al., 2007 Cheung et al., , 2008 We also sought to address potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes by a completely different method, namely utilizing the epitope predictions hosted by the IEDB Vita et al., 2019) . For B cell epitopes, we used methods that predict linear epitopes (Jespersen et al., 2017) , and in the case of the spike glycoprotein where a reliable structure recently became available (Wrapp et al., 2020) , the Discotope 2.0 method that also predicts epitopes based on protein conformation and residue exposure.

Characteristics of each unique epitope (i.e., species, protein of provenance, positive assay type(s), MHC restriction) were tabulated, as well as the total number of donors tested and corresponding total number of donors with positive responses in B or T cell assays, and as a function of host. Finally, T or B cell assay specific response frequency scores (RF) were calculated broadly (i.e., any host), or for specific contexts (e.g., T cell assays in humans). Specifically, RF = [(r -sqrt(r)]/t, where r is the total number of responding donors and t is the total number of donors tested (Carrasco Pro et al., 2015) ).SARS-CoV (tax ID no. 694009) sequence epitope density was visualized with the IEDB Immunobrowser tool (Dhanda et al., 2018) .
