            "text": "Chronic inflammation is a common and important factor in the pathogenesis of neoplasmas. Inflammation is often accompanied by the excessive formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are potentially damaging to DNA and cell membranes. In addition, the expression of COX-2 in inflammatory and neoplastic cells has an impact on various carcinogenic pathways [1e4] . NSAIDs usefulness in chemoprevention is well-documented. Numerous experimental, epidemiological, and clinical studies have found that long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, and some other types of cancer [5e8] . NSAID chemical modifications were undertaken with the aim of improving the NSAIDs safety profile (increasing the analgetic/anti-inflammatory activity and COX1/COX2 selectivity, reducing the ulcerogenic effect or obtaining dual COX/LOX inhibition) [9, 10] . Many efforts were made to get NSAID derivatives with pronounced cytostatic activity as well [11e19] . Thus, we set to prepare a series of new NSAID derivatives rich in nitrogen/oxygen atoms, related to semicarbazides, carbazides, ureas, hydroxyureas and hydroxamic acids, bearing pharmacophores present in numerous antitumor agents [20e23] . Their synthesis, full chemical characterization, and evaluation of their cytostatic, antiviral and antioxidative potential are reported in this paper.",

Samples were measured in DMSO-d 6 solutions at 20 C in 5 mm NMR tubes. Chemical shifts (d) in ppm were referred to TMS. CHN analyses were performed on CHNS LECO analyzer and were within AE0.4%. Solvent systems dichloromethane/methanol (9:1 and 9.5:0.5), cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (1:1), petroleum ether/ ethyl acetate/methanol (3:1:0.5 and 1:2:0.1) and precoated silica gel 60 F 254 plates were used for thin-layer chromatography.

The tested compounds do not discriminate very much between the different tumor cell lines regarding their cytostatic activity, except for the human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells that are generally more sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of the compounds than the other carcinoma cell lines ( Table 1 ). The most active compounds 4benzhydryl-1- [2-(3-phenoxyphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5l), 4-benzhydryl-1- [2-(3-benzylphenyl) propanoyl]semicarbazide (5s), and 4-benzhydryl-1-[2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propanoyl]semicarbazide (5f) inhibited tumor cell proliferation at IC 50 values ranging from 3 to 23 mM. It is striking to observe that those three most active compounds consistently contain the same unique structural motif (i.e. a 4-benzhydryl-1-propanoyl-semicarbazide), whereas lack of any bulky aromatic or cycloalkyl group resulting in a free endstanding eCONHNH 2 or eCONHOH group virtually annihilates the cytostatic activity. Thus, the presence of a bulky lipophilic group, preferably a benzhydryl group, is strictly required at this terminal end. It would be interesting to introduce additional substituents on the benzhydryl moiety (i.e. alkyl, alkoxy, halogene, amine, carboxylic acid and/or hydroxyl groups) to further explore the cytostatic potential and selectivity of these test compounds. The NSAID terminal of these molecules seems to be less important (i.e. isobutyl, phenoxyphenyl, benzyl) to determine the antiproliferative potency.

All other compounds generally showed the same inhibitory effect toward tumor and non-tumor cell lines, except toward breast cancer cells MCF-7, which were shown to be slightly more sensitive. Still, these results should be interpreted with caution without detailed experiments and/or specific target identification, because although these cells are not tumorigenic, they are immortalized and have a relatively short doubling time. However, all tested NSAID derivatives show much lower toxicity toward HaCaT, compared to the reference compounds 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin.",

Conversely, substances with potent anti-inflammatory and/or antioxidant activities are anticipated to exert chemopreventive effects on carcinogenesis, particularly in the stage of promotion and to act as antitumor promoters. Taking under consideration the above mentioned as well as the antioxidant and cytostatic activities of our compounds, it seems that three out of five of the most active LP inhibitors are the strongest antiproliferative agents as well.

It is known that metals, especially iron and copper, can play a key role in free radical generation and propagation. Therefore, metal chelators can act as protectors. This could be partly a possible mechanism of action of 5l, 5s, 5f. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) play a significant role in membrane lipid peroxidation by forming hydroperoxides in the lipid bilayer from the biotransformation of arachidonic acid catalyzed by LOX [40] . LOX inhibitors have attracted attention initially as potential agents for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases, certain types of cancer, and cardiovascular diseases [41, 42] . In order to diminish the pro-cancerous mechanisms a key treatment strategy is to reduce the free radical load. Antioxidant activity by the scavenging of reactive oxygen species is important in preventing potential damage to cellular macromolecules such as DNA, proteins and lipids. Moreover, it has been found that LOX inhibitors may have chemopreventive activity in lung carcinogenesis [43] . Reports published over the past three decades support a growth-regulatory role of arachidonic acid metabolites in the etiology of mammary carcinogenesis [44] . Studies have demonstrated that levels of several eicosanoids are increased in breast cancer in comparison to benign breast tumors [45] .",
