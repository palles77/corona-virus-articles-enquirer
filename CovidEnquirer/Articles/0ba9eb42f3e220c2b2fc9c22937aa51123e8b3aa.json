The experiments were conducted with a stainless steel reactor equipped with a negative air ion generator, a photocatalytic filter, and two ultraviolet lamps with 365 nm wavelength. The removal efficiency ( ), defined as one minus the ratio of the outlet concentration to the inlet concentration of the appropriate bioaerosol, was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the removal methods. The combination of NAI and PCO was the most efficient removal method for aerosolized E. coli ( =0.304\u00b10.06.0.364\u00b10.008), C. famata ( =0.433\u00b10.08.0.598\u00b10.047), and vir phage ( =0.689\u00b10.02.0.903\u00b10.06). In this removal method, the contributions of NAI were higher than those of PCO for the removal of E. coli and C. famata; for the removal of virus phage the contributions of NAI and PCO were comparable NAI was the least efficient removal method for bioaerosols, and the removal efficiencies are: = 0.175 \u00b1 0.04.0.245 \u00b1 0.03 for E. coli; = 0.216 \u00b1 0.007.0.297 \u00b1 0.044 for C. famata; and = 0.299 \u00b1 0.12.0.384 \u00b1 0.02 for vir phage. \u1b67",

            "text": "TiO 2 PCO has been applied for the purification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Luo & Ollis, 1996; Yu & Lee, 2007; and for the disinfection of microbial contaminations in liquid phase (Cho, Chung, Choi, & Yoon, 2005; Christensen, Curtis, Egerton, Kosa, & Tinlin, 2003; Lee, Nishida, Otaki, & Ohgaki, 1997; Sunada, Kikuchi, Hashimoto, & Fujishima, 1998) . Moreover, the mechanisms of PCO for the removal of microbial contaminations and VOCs have also been reported (Cho et al., 2005; Maness et al., 1999; Sunada et al., 1998; Yu & Lee, 2007; . Lin and Li (2003a) demonstrated that the effectiveness of a photocatalytic filter on the removal of bioaerosols was insignificant, which might be caused by a lack of enough time (on the order of 1 s) for the microorganisms to contact and react with the TiO 2 and reactive species generated by the PCO reaction. Some studies also showed that the destruction of microorganisms increased significantly with the time exposure to the photocatalyst and the contact surface between the microorganism and photocatalyst (Keller et al., 2005; Vohra et al., 2006) . Lin and Li (2003a) recommended that the reaction time of the photocatalyst with the collected microorganisms could be extended by enhancing the filtration efficiency of the photocatalytic filter. NAI seems to be one of the good choices to fulfill this purpose (Lee, Yermakov, & Grinshpun, 2004a) . Additionally NAI can be used as a removal method for bioaerosols (Fan, Song, Hildebrand, & Forney, 2002; Grinshpun et al., 2007; Mitchell & King, 1994; Noyce & Hughes, 2002) The removal of aerosol contaminants by unipolar air ionization (usually NAI) in indoor environments (Grabarczyk, 2001; Grinshpun et al., 2007; Lee, Yermakov, & Grinshpun, 2004b) or confined indoor spaces (Grinshpun et al., 2005) has been studied. Mayya, Sapra, Khan, and Sunny (2004) developed a model to analyze the physical factors which influenced the aerosol removal in the presence of unipolar air ionization.",

E. coli is a common rod-shaped bacterium with a particle size of about 0.78 m and is often selected as a challenge bioaerosol for germicidal tests (Keller et al., 2005; Lin & Li, 2003a , 2003b Maness et al., 1999; Vohra et al., 2005 Vohra et al., , 2006 . C. famata is a frequently encountered airborne yeast with a particle size of about 2.44 m and has been selected as a challenge bioaerosol for germicidal tests (Lin & Li, 2003a , 2003b . vir phage is a harmless virus with an isometric head of about 0.05 m in diameter and a thin flexible tail of about 0.15 m in length and about 7 nm in diameter. The host of vir phage is E. coli K12S (BCRC 14894), and this phage has been evaluated as a prospective surrogate for water-borne and food-borne viruses (Chen, Joerger, Hoover, & Kingsley, 2004) . The test microorganisms from BCRC were shipped in freeze-dried form and needed to be activated before the experiments. The activation procedures were conducted according to the BCRC product instruction sheets After the activation, the E. coli and C. famata cultures were transferred to the tryptic soy agar (TSA, Difco\u0bc0) plate (and slant) and the malt extract agar (MEA, Difco\u0bc0) plate (and slant), respectively. The E. coli culture was incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 24 h, and the C. famata culture at 25 \u2022 C for 48 h. The E. coli and C. famata cultures and vir phage stock were stored in a 4 \u2022 C refrigerator. Before the experiments, the test microorganisms were prepared as stocks for bioaerosols generation. The stock preparation processes are described in Sections 2.1.1.-2.1.3.",

This might be owing to the particle size of virus phage (about 0.05 m) being smaller than those of E. coli (about 0.78 m) and C. famata (about 2.44 m). In our previous study (Wu, Lee, Cheng, Yang, & Yu, 2006) , we found that NAI was more efficient in the removal of small particles (0.03 m) than large particles (0.3 m), and this result was attributed to that smaller particles had higher mobility. The findings above were consistent with the results of Grinshpun et al. (2007) and the \"ionizer-aided aerosol removal model\" proposed by Mayya et al. (2004) in which the aerosol removal efficiency was higher for particle size smaller than 0.3 m.

This might be due to the positive effect of RH on the performance of PCO reaction (Luo & Ollis, 1996; Yu & Lee, 2007; . When the TiO 2 absorbed a photon with energy higher than the band gap of TiO 2 , an electron-hole pair would be formed. The electron and hole would react with O 2 and H 2 O to generate reactive species, such as H 2 O 2 and OH\u00b7, which could inactivate the microorganisms on the surface of TiO 2 (Cho et al., 2005; Sunada et al., 1998) . The production of these reactive species increased on increasing the RH. Consequently, the UPFenh under RH 50% and 70% were higher than those under RH 30%. Theoretically, the positive effect of RH also worked on the removal of E. coli. However, owing to the lower filtration efficiency, E. coli cells had relatively less chance to contact with TiO 2 photocatalyst. Therefore, the positive effect of RH on the removal of E. coli was not obviously observed. The higher UPFenh of virus phage in comparison with those of E. coli and C. famata might result from the smaller particle size and simpler structure of virus phage Smaller particle size made virus phage contact with the TiO 2 photocatalyst more efficiently than E. coli and C. famata, and simpler structure made virus phage less resistant to the reactive species produced by the PCO reaction. E. coli and C. famata possess other self-protection mechanisms against the reactive species, including the synthesis of catalase and superoxide dismutase (Grinshpun et al., 2007) . Vohra et al. (2006) also found that the bacteriophage (MS2 phage) destruction rate of photocatalysis was the highest among the test microbes.",

The virus phage filtration (PF) efficiency was relatively high and the particle size of virus phage was relatively small (about 0.05 m). Higher filtration efficiency and smaller particle size made virus phage contact with the TiO 2 photocatalyst (about 0.03 m in diameter) more effectively. As a result, the PCO contributions to the NUPFenh of virus phage were comparable to the NAI contributions, while the NAI contributions to the NUPFenh of E. coli and C. famata were higher than the PCO contributions. Additionally, the effect of RH on the NUPFenh was the combination of the effect of RH on NFPenh and UPFenh . Fig. 9 depicts the variations of test microorganisms removal efficiencies of the Method NUPF with time. The initial aerosolized E. coli, C. famata, and vir PF efficiencies were 0.154 \u00b1 0.046, 0.284 \u00b1 0.019, and 0.425 \u00b1 0.020, respectively.

It was difficult to prolong the operating time since the viability of the test microorganisms in the nebulizer decreased dramatically. According to our results it seemed that the durability of the Method NUPF for vir phage was the highest, and that for C. famata was the lowest. The negative air ion generator and UV lamps were turned off after 4 h operating, and the removal efficiencies decreased dramatically. The dramatic decrease in the removal efficiencies might mainly result from a great quantity of re-suspension of the test microorganisms deposited on the filter fiber and the wall of the reactor after the NAI (electrostatic) and PCO effects were eliminated.",

The increase of RH had a negative effect on the C. famata filtration efficiency of photocatalytic filter (without UV irradiation), due to the reentrainment and higher survival rate of C. famata under high RH. For the aerosolized E. coli and C. famata, the increase of RH had a positive effect on their removal efficiencies of NAI and PCO, which was relevant to the enhancement effect of humidity on the generation of reactive species (H 2 O 2 and OH\u00b7). The increase of RH had a positive effect on the virus phage removal efficiency of photocatalytic filter (filtration), PCO, and the combination of NAI and PCO. The combination of NAI and PCO could enhance the aerosolized microorganisms filtration efficiency of photocatalytic filter by around 0.10-0.35 ( NUPFenh ), and the performance of this removal method for vir phage was more durable than those for E. coli and C. famata. Owing to the smaller particle size (higher mobility), simpler structure, and the lack of self-protection mechanisms, such as synthesis of the catalase and superoxide dismutase, the virus phage removal efficiencies of NAI, PCO, and their combination were the highest among the test microorganisms.",
