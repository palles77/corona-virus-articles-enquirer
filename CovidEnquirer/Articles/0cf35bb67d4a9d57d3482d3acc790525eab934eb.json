            "text": "The HIV-1 ribosomal frameshift element is highly structured, regulates translation of all virally encoded enzymes, and is a promising therapeutic target. The prior model for this motif contains two helices separated by a threenucleotide bulge. Modifications to this model were suggested by SHAPE chemical probing of an entire HIV-1 RNA genome. Novel features of the SHAPE-directed model include alternate helical conformations and a larger, more complex structure. These structural elements also support the presence of a secondary frameshift site within the frameshift domain. Here, we use oligonucleotide-directed structure perturbation, probing in the presence of formamide, and in-virion experiments to examine these models. Our data support a model in which the frameshift domain is anchored by a stable helix outside the conventional domain. Less stable helices within the domain can switch from the SHAPE-predicted to the two-helix conformation. Translational frameshifting assays with frameshift domain mutants support a functional role for the interactions predicted by and specific to the SHAPE-directed model. These results reveal that the HIV-1 frameshift domain is a complex, dynamic structure and underscore the importance of analyzing folding in the context of full-length RNAs.",

            "text": "H IV-1 viral enzymes, including protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase, are generated by cleavage of the precursor polyprotein Gag-Pol. Although the Gag and Pol polyproteins are translated together, the pol gene is encoded in a reading frame offset from the upstream gag reading frame by one nucleotide in the 5\u2032 direction. Consequently, translation of the Gag-Pol fusion protein relies on programmed ribosomal frameshifting that involves translation of the Gag polyprotein followed by a recoding event that shifts the ribosome from the gag to the pol reading frame. 1 Frameshifting requires two key elements: The first is a highly conserved UUUUUUA sequence, termed the slippery sequence, at which the switch in reading frame occurs, 2 and the second is a downstream structural element termed the frameshift stimulatory stem. This downstream structure is thought to pause the ribosome while the A and P sites are occupied by the slippery sequence. Although the precise mechanism is not fully understood, frameshifting occurs with a frequency of 5\u221210% in cultured HIV-transfected human cells, and the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio appears to be important for viral fitness. 3 The frameshifting process has consequently attracted interest as a target for the development of therapeutic agents. 4, 5 The original model for the downstream structural element was a single stem-loop. 6 A number of refinements and extensions of this model have been proposed that include additional sequence and structures including pseudoknots, 7\u22129 a triple-stranded RNA species, 10 and two helices. 11 NMR studies performed on 41-and 45-nucleotide (nt) transcripts support the formation of the two-helix model. 12, 13 This conventional two-helix model includes the originally proposed stem (now termed the upper stem) and a lower stem that is separated from the upper stem by a three-purine bulge ( Figure 1 ). The functional importance of this lower stem is supported by experiments demonstrating decreased frameshifting when the lower stem is destabilized by mutation 11 or when a truncated construct containing only the upper stem is used. 14 An alternative, more complex model was proposed based on SHAPE chemical probing experiments performed on an entire HIV-1 genome. 15 SHAPE probing yields a model-free measurement of local nucleotide flexibility that, in turn, provides nucleotide-resolution information about RNA secondary and tertiary structure. 16 SHAPE reactivities can be incorporated into thermodynamics-based folding algorithms 17 resulting in highly accurate RNA secondary structure models. 18, 19 The SHAPE-directed model of the frameshift domain includes five helices ( Figure 1 ). One is equivalent to the upper stem of the two-helix model. One of the additional helices involves refolding of the lower stem of the conventional model into a helix we term the alternate lower stem. SHAPE data also support the formation of three helices outside the domain traditionally identified as the frameshift stimulatory element. These include a helix that sequesters most of the slippery sequence in base-pairing interactions and a 10-bp anchoring helix. Finally, low SHAPE reactivity at a 3-nt strand between the alternate lower stem and anchoring helix supports an additional short secondary structure, which we currently model as a 3-bp helix. SHAPE data suggest that the frameshift domain spans 140 nts, a significantly larger region than is included in the two-helix model ( Figure 1 ).",

We used oligonucleotides containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues 20,21 to selectively disrupt predicted helices. We also used SHAPE to monitor frameshift element structure in the presence of formamide denaturant and in the context of the RNA packaged inside virion particles. To assess the functional importance of the frameshift domain helices, we used sitedirected mutagenesis to destabilize individual helices and measured the resulting frameshift efficiency. 22 Our results provide strong support for the SHAPE-directed frameshift model, and the functional importance of SHAPE-detected conformations for frameshifting reveals that the frameshift domain is a dynamic element capable of structural remodeling and supports the existence of a secondary frameshift site. These results were critically dependent on the use of the entire HIV-1 sequence, a fact that emphasizes the importance of sequence context for studying large, complex functional domains in RNA.",

The standard SHAPE reagent 1M7 30 and two additional SHAPE probing reagents, 1M6 and NMIA, were used in these analyses. 1M6 and NMIA are sensitive to different local structural states and time scales and consequently provide a detailed structural fingerprint for an RNA. 31,32 SHAPE reactivities for the genome region near the frameshift element were highly similar in both Figure 1 ). We conclude that the refolded frameshift domain adopts essentially the same conformation as the ex virio HIV-1 RNA purified under nondenaturing conditions.

Using a long RNA avoids the biases that are often introduced when a truncated sequence of an RNA is studied and ensures that important structural regions are not omitted. Most past studies of the HIV-1 frameshift domain, including NMR analyses that tested the two-helix model, 12, 13 used HIV-1 sequences that were much shorter than the 140-nt region that we show here, which constitutes the full frameshift domain. The three main helices unique to the SHAPE-directed model were thus unable to form in the truncated sequences analyzed previously. Two of these helices, the alternate lower stem and the helix that sequesters the slippery sequence, appear to mutually stabilize each other because disruption of either of these helices by LNA binding destabilized or induced refolding of the other (Figure 2) . Additionally, the anchoring helix likely stabilizes both of these helices. The frameshift domain adopts the same structure whether the genomic RNA is probed directly after extraction from virions or is first heat-denatured and then refolded. This similarity suggests that the differences between the SHAPE-directed model and the conventional model are due primarily to the presence of the complete sequence of the viral RNA that was used in development of the SHAPE-directed model. Co-transcriptional RNA folding thus apparently does not alter the folding of this region of the genome. However, inside virions, portions of the frameshift domain are less structured than in the extracted RNA, suggesting that higher-order protein or ligand interactions modulate domain structure in the native virion environment.",

The anchoring helix is the first frameshift domain secondary structural element to be unwound by the translating ribosome ( Figure 7A,B) . LNA binding experiments indicate that unwinding of this helix induces a major structural rearrangement throughout the frameshift domain. The lower stem switches from the alternate helix to the conventional stem conformation, and the slippery sequence helix is significantly destabilized. The functional implications of this structural rearrangement are not understood, but the Construct \u0394ss has mutations that disrupt the standard slippery sequence. All other constructs also contain the \u0394ss mutation. Construct 6 additionally includes a C-to-U mutation that creates the proposed secondary slippery sequence. Constructs 7 and 8 contain this secondary slippery sequence and additional mutations that disrupt either the anchoring helix (7) or the 3-nt helix (8) . Frameshift efficiencies were normalized as in Figure 5 . importance of conformational switching was recently demonstrated in ribosomal recoding in another retrovirus. 41 Prior studies using an RNA containing up to 90 nucleotides of the HIV-1 frameshift domain sequence indicate that sequences in the conventional lower stem are functionally important for frameshifting in cultured cells but not in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. 11, 14 Our mutagenesis studies similarly show that disruption of the conventional lower stem does not yield detectable changes in frameshift efficiency in reticulocyte lysate ( Figure 5 , compare WT vs 3). Using a longer fragment of HIV-1 RNA that spans the entire SHAPE-defined domain (nts 1567\u22121711), we observed that disrupting the alternate lower stem while allowing the conventional lower stem to form resulted in dramatically reduced frameshifting ( Figure 5 , mutant 4). In contrast, when both the anchoring helix and the alternate lower stem were disrupted while preserving the ability of the conventional lower stem to form, frameshifting actually increased above native-like levels ( Figure 5, mutant 5) . Thus, the frameshift domain structure is dynamic, and the stabilities of the component helices are coupled.",

The high stability of the anchoring helix suggests that this structure may reform after the ribosome has translated through it. If this is the case, the ribosome would encounter the anchoring helix for a second time before exiting the frameshift domain ( Figure 7D ).

Frameshift efficiency is primarily dependent upon the local stability of the first three base pairs of the helix located approximately eight nucleotides from the slippery site, which is the length of RNA required to span the distance from the slippery site to the ribosomal mRNA entrance channel. 22 Consistent with this eight nucleotide distance, our results indicate that frameshifting from the second slippery site is dependent upon the integrity of the 3-bp helix but not the anchoring stem, which would be too far away from the second slippery site to induce frameshifting ( Figure  6 ).",

From a functional perspective, the alternate lower stem is important for native-like frameshift levels in the context of the larger domain structure and consequently represents a potential therapeutic target. We also examined the sequence and structural requirements of a previously identified secondary frameshift site and found that its function is dependent on structural elements outside the traditional frameshift domain but within the SHAPE-directed model. This work illustrates the influence of global sequence context on RNA structure and the ability of SHAPE probing to reveal complex functional domains in large RNAs. ",
