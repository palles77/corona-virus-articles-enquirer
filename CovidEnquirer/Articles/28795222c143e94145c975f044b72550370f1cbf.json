Shuang Han, Fei-Fei Zhang, Xin Xie and Jian-Zhong Chen* Pharmacophore-oriented 1,2,4-triazolones were designed and synthesized to have CB1 receptor antagonistic potency. Docking simulations were performed to predict the interaction modes of 1,2,4-triazolones binding to both CB1 and CB2 receptors. 8-Trifluoromethylquinoline based 1,2,3-triazoles derivatives were synthesized, characterized by spectral studies and X-ray analysis. Among the synthesized compounds 5c, 6b, 8b, 11 and 12 showed good antimicrobial activity.",

Patri* Novel benzothiazole based cationic lipids with benzothiazoles derivatives in the head group region and long hydrocarbon chain as the anchoring group have been synthesized and evaluated the gene transfection properties.Novel coumarin-dihydropyrazole thio-ethanone derivatives: Design, synthesis and anticancer activity pp. 717-725Xiao-Qin Wu, Cheng Huang, Ying-Ming Jia, Bao-An Song, Jun Li** and Xin-Hua Liu* Novel 4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl-2-thio-ethanones as potential telomerase inhibitors were synthesized. The mechanism of the antitumor action indicated that title compounds could inhibit the growth of MGC-803 cells via the induction of tumor cell apoptosis.Ligand selectivity of estrogen receptors by a molecular dynamics study pp. 726-735 Guodong Hu* and Jihua Wang* Ligands selectivity in estrogen receptors has been studied. The results show that the selectivity for 659 is mainly from eight residues. In this paper, the synthesis, configuration determination and biological evaluation of CM 2 , which is one of the major metabolite of clausenamide, and its stereoisomers was described.",
