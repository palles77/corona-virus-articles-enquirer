Adenovirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy (EM) in the intestinal contents of brushtail possums (Trichosurus 6ulpecula) in New Zealand. Using degenerate PCR primers complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses, the complete nucleotide sequence of the penton base gene, and partial nucleotide sequences of the DNA polymerase, hexon, and pVII genes were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the penton base gene strongly suggested that the brushtail possum adenovirus (candidate PoAdV-1) belongs to the recently proposed genus Atadeno6irus. Sequence analysis of the PCR products amplified from the intestinal contents of brushtail possums originating from different geographical regions of New Zealand identified a single genotype. This is the first report of molecular confirmation of an adenovirus in a marsupial.",

These viruses would either be pathogenic to brushtail possums, or suitable as vectors for the delivery of contraceptive antigens. An electron microscopy (EM) survey of brushtail possum intestinal contents (Rice and Wilks, 1996) revealed the presence of four types of viruses: adenoviruses, herpesviruses, coronaviruses and coronavirus-like particles. Other reports of viruses of the brushtail possum include a papillomavirus (Perrott et al., 2000) and a retrovirus (Baillie and Wilkins, 2001) . Of these viruses, the adenovirus was selected as the most promising candidate for further investigation as a possible gene delivery vector.",

Embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated via the chorioallantoic membrane, the allantoic cavity, and yolk sac routes. Between three and seven passages were performed in each of these culture systems. There was no evidence of viral replication in any system. A molecular-based approach using degenerate PCR primers was, therefore, used to obtain DNA sequence information. In this paper, the sequence analysis of an adenovirus partially purified from the intestines of a brushtail possum is described. Adenoviral sequences obtained by PCR from intestinal contents of brushtail possums from different regions of New Zealand are also compared.",

Although no other marsupial adenovirus sequences were available, the homology at both the nucleotide and protein level for the pol and hexon genes enabled degenerate PCR primers to be designed. PCR using degenerate primers as a means to detect a non-cultivable putative adenovirus has been used previously, for guinea pig adenovirus (Pring-A , kerblom et al., 1997) , and recently for red squirrel adenovirus (Sainsbury et al., 2001) . However, only very short sequences from the hexon gene were obtained in both cases. The described degenerate pol primers have recently been used by M\u00e1ria Benk\u00f6 and her co-workers, to obtain the first DNA sequence data from fish and snake adenoviruses (personal communication).",

The results of the phylogenetic analysis strongly suggest that the brushtail possum adenovirus is a new member of this proposed genus. This preliminary classification is important for the design of further degenerate primers, as sequence alignments with members of the Atadeno6irus genus will be more important than those with members of the other adenovirus genera. A definitive classification, however, may only be possible when (Benk\u00f6 et al., 2000) containing the host designation and type (or strain) number (B, bovine; C, canine; D, duck; F, fowl; Fr, frog; H, human; M, murine; O, ovine; P, porcine; Po, possum; T, turkey).

Examples of the latter would be the p32K gene, present only in atadenoviruses; the E1b regions, present in both atadeno-and mastadenoviruses; and the absence of proteins V, IX and the E3 region in atadenoviruses.",
