            "text": "information on hepatitis C and other bloodborne viruses is also needed in non-healthcare settings, particularly in practices where sharp instruments such as slicers that are likely to cause hand injuries are used and shared by workers. In these practices, healthcare authorities should highlight the importance of wearing gloves and the prevention of cutting injuries. 12 The detection of emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and novel influenza A (H1N1), has become a continuous public health concern. Thus, the accurate diagnosis of pathogens in samples is becoming increasingly important. Currently, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification and DNA microarray, are used with greater frequency in preference to traditional cultureor antigen-based diagnostic procedures, primarily as a result of their greater sensitivity. However, almost all diagnostic NAATs require viral genome information in advance, and thus cannot be used to detect or characterize novel or unexpected viral infections. Likewise, these methods are completely ineffective if a viral genome has evolved sufficiently to result in point mutations at primer binding sites [1, 2] . New sequencing technologies referred to as 'second-generation,' such as 454 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), Solexa (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and SOLiD (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), show promise for the unbiased detection of pathogens. These systems allow researchers to obtain millions of sequences in a single round of operation, as well as an almost complete spectrum of nucleotide information through comparison and analysis with relevant databases. Because the 454 system has previously identified viral pathogens in nasal and faecal specimens [3] , we tested the ability of Solexa, another unbiased highthroughput sequencing platform, to detect viral infections in clinical specimens without using any viral genetic information in advance.",

            "text": "Nucleic acid sequence-based methods have been used extensively for the diagnosis of viral infection in recent years. However, most methods depend on prior knowledge of pathogen sequences, rendering them ineffective for detecting unexpected or mutated viral sequences. This limitation may be overcome by the use of new high-throughput sequencing strategies. In the present study, we demonstrate the potential of our unbiased pangenomic approach for identifying pathogenic viruses directly without advance genetic information. cDNAs, as templates for the Solexa platform, were prepared by random primer using RNAs extracted from clinical samples. The system produced >5.908 million reads per run within 48 h and enabled us to obtain an almost complete spectrum of nucleotide information from each sample, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. Upon further analysis of identified viral reads, influenza sequences were present in 32-254 of the 158 327-580 424 valid reads in each sample (Table 1) . Importantly, the coverage rates were in the range 8.39-44.56%, which is sufficient for viral subtype identification. Novel A (H1N1) and seasonal A (H3N2) viruses were detected in the absence of prior genetic infor-mation, consistent with the classical RT-PCR diagnostic method. This suggests that this approach can contribute to the detection of unexpected or mutated virus by direct comparison with mutant and wild-type viral sequences in the Ref-Seq database. Likewise, pathogens eliciting similar symptoms could be distinguished in a single sample through analysis of unbiased high-throughput sequencing results, enabling the accurate diagnosis of mixed infection.",

Rotaviruses possess a segmented, double-stranded RNA genome and are classified into seven groups (A-G) based on their distinctness with respect to genes and capsid proteins. Group A, B and C rotaviruses cause disease in both humans and animals [1] . Group C rotavirus (GpC RV), first detected in piglets [2] and an infant [3] , has been associated with sporadic cases and outbreaks of gastroenteritis among children and adults in many countries [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . GpC RV is generally considered to cause a relatively milder disease, with fewer episodes of vomiting per day and less dehydration compared to group A rotavirus (GpA RV) infection in children [4, 7] . All human GpC RV strains detected to date throughout the world have shown high sequence conservation and belong to single G and P genotypes [10,11]. By contrast, human GpC strains are divergent from those in cattle and swine [11] [12] [13] [14] . In the present study, for the first time, we detected GpC RV in faecal samples from children with acute diarrhoea in South Korea and determined the genetic relatedness of the Korean isolate to other published strains.",

All 434 samples were screened for GpA RV by using a Rotatek\u00e4 kit (South Korea Green Cross Corp., Seoul, South Korea) [15] and, for GpC RV, by using an in-house immunoassay developed with hyperimmune sera against porcine GpC RV Cowden strain and human GpC RV VLPs [4, 16] . Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with porcine anti-GpC serum (U340; dilution 1:2000) or normal porcine serum (Z1329; dilution 1:2000) in coating buffer (35 mM NaHCO 3 , 15 mM Na 2 CO 3 , pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline-Tris (pH 7.6) and incubated with blotto for 1 h at 37\u00b0C.
