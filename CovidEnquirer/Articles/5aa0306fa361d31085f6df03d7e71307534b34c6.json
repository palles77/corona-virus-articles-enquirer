SEIO(MH) model is a real-time discrete model with two more essential parameters: 1) the number of people with medical care (M), and 2) the currently available beds in hospitals. The local status dynamic SEIO (MH) model could simulate the population in each status at any date during the epidemic. Also, this model could simulate multiple national public health responses including: 1) lockdown of the traffic in one city, 2) the hospital bed shortage as well as the amelioration in the medical system when multiple converted hospitals are available, and 3) the temporary public gathering events.",

After the increasing number of beds in hospitals at Date Jan 25 th , Jan 31 th , Feb 6 th , and Feb 10 th , the hospital was still full immediately, indicating the deficiency of medical resources in Wuhan at the early period ( Figure  2a ). After the large scale of mobile cabin hospitals, the shortage of beds in hospitals was improved. We expected that the peak point in Wuhan would be Feb 17 th , 2020 with 24,115 infected people, including 7,676 exposed, 1,999 infected with symptoms and 2,877 with medical care (Figure 2c) , and the epidemic would end on Jun. 17 th , 2020 with 77,453 infected people eventually, which was basically consistent with Yang's study 14 . The basic reproduction number \u0734 was estimated to be 2.65 and would drop to 1.98 after one month since the lockdown. This result suggested that the choice of lockdown date and the number of hospital beds would significantly affect the development of the epidemic. Also, it should be noticed that the time of the epidemic period is overlapped with the Chinese Lunar New Year, in which public gathering events are expected. Thus, 1) the date of lockdown, 2) the number of available hospital beds 3) the public gathering events, were considered in our simulation.",

During the epidemic period, nowcasting and forecasting are crucial for public health planning and control domestically and internationally 12, 22 . Here, we constructed a real-time status dynamic SEIO (MH) model to estimate the local outbreaks. By adding the parameters of status M and H, this model could accurately forecast the epidemics when the medical system under unexpected pressure. Moreover, this model could simulate the influence of different public health policies such as 1) lockdown of the city and 2) construction of temporary hospitals, which could help design the appropriate public health policies for epidemic control. At present, besides Wuhan, the epidemic situation in China has been effectively contained within a short period of time. This is largely due to the rapid response of the Chinese governments at various levels and the decision to lock down Wuhan, which is the first time to block a city with over 9 million permanent residents in human history. The lockdown of Wuhan would not only prevent the transportation between Wuhan to other cities, but also decrease the circulation intensity of people within Wuhan. According to BAIDU migration data, the circulation index of Wuhan is 6 to 8 times lower than those before the lockdown. The number of newly confirmed cases increased rapidly after the lockdown may due to the fact that, there have been already 4,521 infected and 6,536 exposed without symptoms before lockdown. It is noted that only 444 confirmed cases were reported by the Health Commission of Hubei Province 16 . However, by facing an epidemic with the new pathogen, it is difficult to invent the diagnosis kit in such a short time. Thus, the diagnosis quantity might affect the early understanding of the epidemics and the lockdown decision at that time was decisive and timely. In fact, even one day delay of the lockdown would make 17,631 more infected people at the end point and a one-week delay would make the epidemic in Wuhan uncontrollable with over 1.9 million infectious.",

Currently, multiple countries including Koran, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are in the outbreak stage 24 . As the first country facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the experience of China in fighting the epidemics might provide useful guidance for other countries. According to our modeling study, we believe that the most effective public health policies for SARS-CoV-2 epidemic prevention are provided as follows: 1) reduce the local circulation intensity of people, 2) prepare enough medical resources, especially available beds in hospitals, 3) try to prohibit large public gathering events. It is expected that this study might provide useful guidance for other countries in fighting against the epidemic of COVID-19 or other similar infectious diseases.",
