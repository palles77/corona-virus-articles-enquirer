However, the sample size for each country (e.g. 1,012 participants for Great Britain) limit the ability to stratify by multiple demographic factors and still obtain precise estimates of social mixing within those groups, and does not have details about the location of participants, which meant social contacts could not be compared between spatial covariates such as urban and rural setting.

As a result, the early data had more contacts of this age than was plausible. In our analysis, we therefore remove users with 3 or more contacts of the age exactly 50 (4,007 users dropped). These users together reported 101,880 contacts out of which 24,171 were aged exactly 50-years-old. Second, the initial version did not allow users to record precisely zero contacts: these users may thus be missing from our denominators, we do not expect this effect to be large and for simplicity have not attempted to correct for it here.",

For each of those age groups, we find t ij : the total number of reported contacts over the course of 24 hours between participants in age group j and their reported contacts of estimated age group i. To find the mean number of contacts (m ij ) who are in age group i as reported by participants in age group j we divide t ij by n j -the total number of participants in age group j.

As the sample of participants might have a different population structure than the wider population, this step depends on the country-specific population structure: we define w i as the total population size of the age group i. In our case, volunteers needed to be in the UK to participate in the study, so we use the 2018 mid-year estimate of the population structure of the UK (available from ONS [1] ). The reciprocal matrix C = (c ij ) gives the population contact matrix, where c ij = 1 2 (m ij + m ji wi wj ) [29] . The population matrix C is of particular importance for infectious disease dynamics because it is related to the next generation matrix [7, 27] . The next generation matrix N captures how the infection spreads when pathogen is first introduced in a population, and its (i, j) entry gives the expected number of new infections in compartment i produced by in infected individual introduced into compartment j. As a result, the dominant eigenvalue of N is equal to the basic reproduction number R 0 or the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single individual introduced to a completely susceptible population.

However, conversational contacts within the home saturated at around 4 in households of size 5 or larger, and physical contacts saturated at 2 in households of size 4-6, before declining again. We also found many contacts reported on average within the home for the 10% of participants who lived alone (self-reported household size of 1): although 62% of participants who lived alone reported no contacts within the home, the remaining 38% of these participants reported 2.4 contacts within ",

In Great Britain, the POLYMOD study had 1,012 participants reporting a total of 11,876 contacts (11.74 contacts on average). This is higher than the daily average reported number of contacts in the BBC contact dataset with 36,155 participants reporting 378,599 contacts (10.47 contacts reported on average). For most age groups, the total number of contacts per day for an average person (assuming 2018 population structure [1] ) is remarkably similar between BBC and POLYMOD datasets, especially for ages over 60 (Fig 6A) . In BBC contact data a smaller proportion of those contacts are physical (and correspondingly a higher proportion of contacts are conversational only). The reduction in the average number of contacts for ages 10-19 is striking between POLYMOD and BBC datasets. While for the 10-14 age group this may be affected with the fact that we are only sampling a subset of this age group and assuming that 13-and 14-year-olds are representative of the entire age group, for 15-to 19-year-olds this reduction is real. This could be the effect of our sampled population, or it might be a signature of a real change in social contacts of teenagers since POLYMOD. A survey of over 1,000 13-to 17-year-olds in the US in the 2018 showed that compared to 2012 teens' preference for direct face-to-face communication with friends has declined substantially (from a half to a third) while the interactions over social media have increased [24] . A similar trend in digitisation of teenager interactions is likely to be present also in the rest of the world with comparable teenage mobile phone use, and it is possible that the reduction in both conversational and physical contacts in our dataset is a reflection of teenage interactions moving away from face-to-face to social media.",

We compare POLYMOD matrices for Great Britain consisting of the average number of contacts recorded per day per survey participant that are available from Mossong et al. [22] Table S5 . Even though the raw data from POLYMOD is available, these matrices are most commonly used, which is why we choose them for the comparison with BBC matrices. Ages are grouped in 5-year bins until the age of 70, and a single 70+ age group (total of 15 age-groups). For the comparison of matrices we follow the same grouping (Fig 7) , and make both BBC and POLYMOD matrices reciprocal using the 2018 population vector for England and Wales [1] .",

For pathogens that require close sustained contact for transmission (such as commensal skin colonisers associated with nosocomial infections like Staphilococcus aureous [12] ), physical contacts might be more relevant. For very easily transmissible pathogens like measles, some combination of physical and conversational contacts would better represent transmission. Figure 8A illustrates the difference between the average number of people contacted for a whole range of matrices ranging from physical contacts only to all contacts (by gradually adding conversational contacts in increments of 0.1). The average number of physical contacts in the POLYMOD dataset are more than twice that of the BBC dataset.

The large scale nature of the BBC data presented, with over 36,000 users and over 378,000 contacts, made it possible to generate fine-scale age-specific social contact matrices across different contexts, and by week and weekend. These could be used to explore the impact of different intervention strategies that rely on social distancing to reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, and working from home) on flattening and postponing the peak of an outbreak. There were some notable differences between these matrices and those presented in the POLYMOD study, which surveyed 1,012 people in Great Britain. In particular, POLYMOD participants report higher overall mean contacts than BBC participants (11.7 compared to 10.5 people on average), although this difference is reduced when both dataset are calibrated to the same population structure. More than a decade has passed since the POLY-MOD study, and it is possible that the average number of contacts in the UK may have dropped. This is particularly evident in the reduction of teenage contacts, which could be the signature of a real change in how teenagers interact with one-another and their preferred way of interacting with their friends shifting from face-to-face to social media over last several years [24] . While the mean number of conversational contacts reported by participants in the BBC study was higher than in 10 POLYMOD (7.9 and 5.9 respectively), the mean number of physical contacts was significantly lower, and mostly limited to contacts at home. Moreover, POLYMOD by design oversampled children, whereas the BBC data oversampled adults, and hence may have captured more of the tail of the contact distribution in older age groups.",

For a flu-like pathogen, this core group will be responsible for driving transmission in the wider population [2] which can be seen from indirect effects observed in other age-groups by targeting the vaccination of children [13] . In our previous work [17] we filled the missing square sub-matrix (the dimensions of it will depend on the size of the age-groups chosen in the model) after making contacts reciprocal with appropriate values from POLYMOD, and here we take an additional step of rescaling the missing sub-matrix so that the overall dominant eigenvalue of the matrix doesn't change.

Instead, the participants could choose themselves when to run the app which might have biased some to choose a particularly 'interesting' day when they are going to meet a lot of people, or travel somewhere unusual. In addition, the participants themselves were not sampled at random from the population but instead chose to take part. How they heard about the study might might have varied from whether they were reached through social media in the drive to recruit participants before broadcast, or consequent to watching the BBC4 programme, or through hearing about it from friends -all of which could lead to selection bias. Given the big social media exposure around the citizen science project, our participants were recruited largely in two time periods: in October 2017 after the launch of the app, and in March 2018 after the airing of the documentary 'Contagion! The BBC4 Pandemic', but the uneven recruitment of participants over time should not have much impact. There is evidence, at least among school-aged children, that social contact structure during term-time is relatively consistent over a period of several months [19] . Contacts can also change between term-time and school-holidays [8] and with the health status of participants; individuals typically make fewer social contacts when they have ILI compared to a normal day [28] ]. It may therefore be necessary to combine the matrices presented here with other datasets to fully explore transmission dynamics over long periods and account for changes in behaviour according to health status.",

            "text": "Finally, by comparing the BBC mixing matrices to ones from POLYMOD we show that there are important differences in age-specific contributions to transmission with school-children driving transmission in POLYMOD, while in the BBC dataset adults are more responsible. The exception here is if mixing is driven by purely physical contacts when ages 5 to 9 are most responsible for transmission. These results have strong implications for control strategies (such as informing school closures) and using different underlying mixing patterns could lead to different policy recommendations. This illustrates the importance of using several sources of data for informing the age-specific mixing of the population to account for the uncertainty that stems from population mixing.",
