Gagging is the expulsion of oral or pharyngeal material and may be associated with disorders causing dysphagia (i.e., difficult swallowing) or regurgitation. The relatively minor abdominal contractions associated with gagging can often be differentiated from the vigorous abdominal contractions that occur with vomiting. Regurgitation may follow seconds to hours after eating or drinking. If only saliva is regurgitated, eating may not have occurred for hours or even days before the act. Regurgitated food material is undigested and sometimes has a tubular form conforming to the shape of the esophageal lumen. Most clients cannot reliably distinguish undigested from digested food. Regurgitated material that has remained in the esophagus for long time periods often becomes macerated and odoriferous and is mixed with saliva and mucus. If blood is present it is usually undigested (i.e., bright red), whereas blood originating from the stomach is usually partially digested by gastric acid and has a \"coffee ground\" appearance readily distinguishing it from the undigested form.",

Vomiting may cause secondary esophagitis and subsequent regurgitation, or a patient with longstanding esophageal disease may develop another concurrent disorder causing vomiting. It is therefore important to clarify the chronologic order of specific signs. Finally, some patients with signs suggesting regurgitation are vomiting. To aid in differentiation, one may attempt to observe the act of expulsion by feeding the patient, although this is very unreliable (\"watched\" regurgitating patients often do not regurgitate). Watching the patient eat may be helpful, because pharyngeal dysphagia is usually obvious and suggests oropharyngeal disease. Some patients with pharyngeal dysphagia also have concurrent esophageal dysfunction. Contrast radiographs of the pharynx and esophagus usually differentiate the two disorders.",

Contrast radiographs should use barium instead of iodide contrast agents unless esophageal rupture is strongly suspected. The main purpose of a contrast esophagram is to distinguish esophageal motility abnormalities from lesions such as an obstruction, diverticulum, or fistula. Some drugs (e.g., xylazine) commonly used for restraint cause esophageal paralysis, making the radiographs potentially misleading. Esophagoscopy may not diagnose esophageal muscular weakness but is effective for sampling mass lesions, differentiating intramural from extramural obstruction, identifying esophagitis, detecting diverticula, and removing foreign objects. Patients with acquired esophageal weakness (i.e., megaesophagus) should be evaluated for myopathies, neuropathies, and myasthenia gravis (generalized or localized to the esophagus). Occasionally, hypoadrenocorticism, hyperkalemia, lead poisoning, Spirocerca lupi, and selected central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., distemper, hydrocephalus) may be responsible. Generalized or localized myopathies and neuropathies have several causes, such as trauma, dermatomyositis, thymoma, botulism, tick paralysis, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism, systemic lupus erythematosus, nutritional factors, toxoplasmosis, and trypanosomiasis. Dysautonomia has been recognized in dogs and cats and causes generalized dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, including regulation of esophageal motility. Hypothyroidism and systemic lupus erythematosus may exist without obvious clinical signs. It is important to detect these underlying disorders so that one may treat the cause rather than just the symptoms. It is also wise to evaluate patients with unexpected esophageal foreign objects (e.g., a relatively small bolus of food) for partial obstructions (e.g., subclinical vascular ring anomaly, stricture).",

Differentiation of EPI from malabsorptive disease is important. The diagnosis is often overlooked in afflicted dogs or may inappropriately be made in patients without the malady. Clinical trials using pancreatic enzyme preparations are commonly used to diagnose EPI. Unfortunately this method is unreliable. Powdered enzyme is often superior to tablet formulations, and some enzyme preparations are clearly superior to others. Even when appropriate enzymes are administered, some dogs with EPI also require a low-fat diet, antacid therapy (rare), or treatment for concurrent antibiotic-responsive enteropathy (ARE) (common) before the enzyme replacement therapy becomes effective. Too often, failure of the initial enzyme replacement therapy leads to unnecessary tests (i.e., exploratory laparotomy), because the correct diagnosis of EPI was incorrectly eliminated. No consistent hematologic or serum chemistry profile changes are seen, and the serum amylase and lipase values are usually normal. Undigested fats are often found in the feces; however, this is inconsistent. The fat absorption test is inexpensive but can yield false results. The TLI assay is the best test for canine EPI, and the fTLI assay is the best test for feline EPI. It is important to note that the tests are species specific. Measurement of trypsin proteolytic activity also is an accurate means of diagnosing feline EPI; however, it is more cumbersome and has limited availability.",

One must then decide whether to perform diagnostic therapeutic trials or diagnostic tests. A definitive diagnosis usually necessitates intestinal biopsy. Patients that are critically ill (i.e., are emaciated or have serum albumin < 2.2 g/dl) usually should next undergo abdominal ultrasonography and intestinal biopsies (preferably via endoscopy). Patients that are not critically ill may be managed first using therapeutic trials. Therapeutic trials may be chosen more rationally with the aid of minimal laboratory data such as a CBC, biochemical profile, and fecal examinations. The two major therapeutic trials are (1) food trials for dietary intolerance and (2) antibiotic trials for ARE. ARE (previously called \"small intestinal bacterial overgrowth\") may exist by itself or it may coexist with another GI malady. ARE may prevent therapy aimed at the underlying problem from resolving clinical signs. No consistent CBC or serum chemistry profile changes are seen in this syndrome. Fecal culture is not informative, and intestinal biopsy is seldom diagnostic. A barium contrast study may identify a segmental lesion or partial obstruction responsible for secondary ARE. Quantitated culture of duodenal or proximal jejunal fluid for aerobes and anaerobes is difficult to interpret, because clinically normal dogs may have as many or more bacteria than clinically affected dogs. Finding an increased concentration of unconjugated serum bile acids is believed to be supportive of ARE. Bacteria can deconjugate serum bile acids in the intestinal lumen, and these bile acids can be absorbed by the jejunum. However, the test is limited in its availability. Serum vitamin B 12 and folate concentrations have been used as screening procedures for ARE once EPI has been ruled out. Some patients with ARE have normal serum vitamin B 12 and folate concentrations, however. Response to empiric antibiotic therapy supports the diagnosis. Signs secondary to ARE usually respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy (e.g., tetracycline, tylosin, ampicillin, metronidazole) unless irreversible mucosal changes or a primary underlying intestinal disease are seen.",

Intestinal lymphangiectasia causes severe PLE in dogs (it is not reported in cats) and can produce some of the lowest serum protein levels (serum albumin < 1.0 g/dl) that occur in alimentary disease. Because of the loss of lymph into the intestines, peripheral lymphocyte counts may be decreased; hypocholesterolemia and steatorrhea are common. If hepatic insufficiency and loss from the kidneys and skin have been eliminated in a hypoalbuminemic patient, PLE becomes the major differential diagnosis by process of elimination. If PLE is suspected in a patient that has another potential explanation for its hypoalbuminemia (e.g., renal protein loss or substantive hepatic insufficiency), then detecting abnormally high concentrations of alpha-1 protease inhibitor in the feces supports a diagnosis of GI protein loss. The relatively stable alpha-1 proteinase is resistant to GI degradation and consequently can be measured in the feces. Intestinal biopsy is usually the definitive test. Full-thickness biopsy may risk dehiscence if the serum albumin level is less than 1.5 g/dl; however, serosal patch graft techniques decrease the risk of dehiscence. Gastroduodenoscopy-ileoscopy plus biopsy is safe and often (but not invariably) diagnostic. Occasionally the intestinal lesion is inaccessible via endoscopy. Although not recommended, dietary trial may be used in patients with PLE. An ultra-low-fat diet is reasonable if lymphangiectasia is suspected; however, therapeutic trials with steroids are potentially dangerous and are not recommended without a definitive diagnosis.",

The latter are common presenting complaints of many diseases, which is why serum biochemistry profiling is indicated in patients with chronic signs or evidence of systemic disease. It is important to note that no consistent signs or laboratory abnormalities are found in all patients with hepatic disease. When screening for hepatic disease, one should request at least CBC, serum ALT, SAP, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, BUN, glucose, urinalysis, and abdominal imaging. Hepatic function tests (bile acids, ammonia tolerance, clotting times, and others) ultrasonographic examination, hepatic biopsy, or contrast angiography and portography is usually necessary for definitive diagnosis. Abnormalities in hepatic-specific enzymes may result from primary hepatic disease but also occur because of secondary hepatic involvement from a primary nonhepatic disease (e.g., glucocorticoid hepatopathy, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis). After identifying abnormalities in ALT, aspartate transferase (AST), SAP, or GGT, one should investigate first for a primary nonhepatic disease, because nonhepatic disease is the most common cause of increased values. In such cases the liver usually has reactive but reversible degenerative changes.

Changes in ALT, SAP, hepatic function tests, and hepatic size, although suggestive of hepatic disease, are not diagnostic of specific entities. This is true even in breeds with specific predispositions (e.g., Doberman pinschers, Bedlington terriers). Changes in the SAP or serum ALT may also be the result of primary nonhepatic disease (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure). A definitive diagnosis usually requires hepatic biopsy. The clinician should first seek to rule out nonhepatic causes of secondary hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic biopsy should be considered in patients with obviously significant hepatic disease, those that do not have hyperadrenocorticism, and those that have persistent (more than 1 month) changes in serum ALT or SAP consistent with chronic or progressive hepatic disease or abnormal hepatic function tests (see Figure 9 -5). It is not always possible to make these distinctions accurately; therefore, whenever hepatic biopsy is performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy, the rest of the abdomen should be explored and other organs sampled if the clinician FIGURE 9-5. Diagnostic approach to altered hepatic shape or size in dogs and cats. doubts their involvement. Fine-needle aspirates with cytology are sometimes useful in detecting diffuse hepatic infiltrative disease and hepatic lipidosis (see Color Plate 5E); however, fine-needle aspirates (even when guided by ultrasound) often miss infiltrative processes, and a negative cytologic finding never excludes an infiltrative disease in the liver.

Congenital (e.g., portosystemic shunt) and severe acquired hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis) may cause encephalopathy.

In a patient with an increased ALT that is receiving one of these drugs, the medication probably should be stopped, if possible, and the ALT rechecked 2 to 4 weeks later.

Reported fasting serum bile acids that are increased greater than 20 \u00b5mol/L or postprandial values of greater than 25 \u00b5mol/L suggest significant hepatic disease or portosystemic shunting and dictate further hepatic evaluation and possibly hepatic biopsy. Generally, preprandial and postprandial bile acids are determined simultaneously; however, if only fasted values are determined and found to be normal, postprandial measurements are required. The magnitude of the rise or the percent increase from preprandial to postprandial values does not imply a specific diagnosis or prognosis. Most animals with chronic hepatitis, marked hepatic necrosis, cholestasis, and hepatic neoplasia have abnormal values. Bile acids are usually not markedly altered by secondary hepatic disease from nonhepatic disorders or with glucocorticoid or anticonvulsant therapy; however, in rare cases they may be.",

Resting blood ammonia concentrations are probably less sensitive than fasting serum bile acids in detecting hepatic dysfunction, whereas the ATT is possibly as sensitive as preprandial and postprandial bile acids in detecting portosystemic shunting. A significantly increased fasting blood ammonia concentration renders an ATT unnecessary. Clinical signs are not well correlated with blood ammonia concentrations. An abnormal ATT result or resting ammonia value in a patient with hepatic disease is generally an indication for hepatic biopsy or a portogram. Rarely, plasma ammonia is increased because of urinary tract obstruction, especially if complicated by infection with urease-producing bacteria. Some young dogs (notably Scottish deerhounds in Great Britain) have been found to have elevated resting blood ammonia values that spontaneously return to normal as the dog ages. Therefore, caution must be used when diagnosing congenital portosystemic shunting in at least some breeds solely by evaluating the resting serum ammonia concentration.",

If a patient had a reasonable appetite when weight loss began, major differential diagnoses are intestinal disease, maldigestion, increased use of calories (e.g., hyperthyroidism, lactation), or increased loss of calories (e.g., diabetes mellitus). If no other identifiable problems (other than weight loss or anorexia) can be pursued, a systematic search is indicated (Figure 9 -9). One should first preclude as many causes as possible with the history and physical examination (i.e., lack of food, calorie-deficient food, inability to eat, regurgitation, vomiting and diarrhea). Next, extensive clinicopathologic screening is indicated. Imaging is considered an extension of the physical examination, and abdominal and thoracic radiographs are appropriate. Thoracic radiographs may be very revealing, even if a patient does not have coughing or abnormal lung sounds. Abdominal ultrasonography is particularly desirable and often more useful than radiographs if the operator is accomplished. If laboratory or radiographic abnormalities are not present or are unconvincing, one may repeat the tests at 1 to 3 week intervals, depending on the clinical condition of the patient, or immediately proceed to function tests, biopsies, or both. Certain hepatic and adrenal gland diseases may require such function tests. It is noteworthy that severe gastric or intestinal disease may cause anorexia or severe weight loss without vomiting or diarrhea.",

Analysis \u2022 Fresh feces, preferably taken from a dog that has begun to show signs in the last 24 to 36 hours, are used according to kit instructions (see Chapter 15). The instructions must be carefully followed or false results might be obtained. Normal Values \u2022 Dogs should not have parvoviral antigen in feces. Interpretation \u2022 A positive result supports canine parvoviral enteritis. Not all dogs affected with parvoviral enteritis have diarrhea and fever; some show only anorexia, vomiting, or fever. Theoretically, if coproantibody binds all of the antigen in the feces, a false-negative result may occur. If the test is performed too early in the disease, it may yield negative results. With such dogs, one should repeat the test in 36 to 48 hours. Shedding of viral particles decreases after the first week of disease, and a test performed too late in the disease might yield negative results. Modified-live vaccination results in transient fecal shedding and can give a weak positive fecal ELISA test result (5 to 15 days after vaccination). Occasional Indications \u2022 Dogs with acute, nosocomial diarrhea or chronic large bowel diarrhea of unknown cause. Advantages \u2022 Relatively easy to perform. Disadvantages \u2022 Might be difficult to interpret results, especially of old fecal samples. Uncertain sensitivity and specificity for Clostridium perfringens-associated diarrhea. Analysis \u2022 Fresh or frozen feces used according to the instructions on the test kit.

Normal Values \u2022 No trophozoites or fecal antigen present.FECAL CRYPTOSPORIDIUM DETECTIONRare Indications \u2022 Chronic diarrhea. Cats (especially with feline immunodeficiency virus[FIV]  infection) may be more likely to have cryptosporidiosis than dogs, but the prevalence of this disorder is currently unknown.Disadvantages\u2022 Oocysts are small and may be difficult to find.Analysis \u2022 Fresh fecal samples should be sent to a referral laboratory experienced in finding Cryptosporidium. Special fecal flotation techniques, direct fecal smears stained with an acid-fast stain, or ELISA methodology (e.g., ProSpecT Cryptosporidium Microplate Assay, Alexon, Lenexa, KS) can be used. The ELISA methodology appears to be the most sensitive. Values \u2022 Dog and cat feces should be negative for Cryptosporidium.",

In general, indocyanine green (ICG) is not recommended.Analysis \u2022 See prior editions.Frequent Indications \u2022 Suspected occult hepatic disease, chronic weight loss, abnormal CNS signs, icterus, hepatomegaly, and microhepatia; also to monitor hepatic function in patients with known hepatic diseases. Because of the ease of this test compared with BSP, ICG, and ammonia, serum bile acids are used routinely as a screening test for hepatic dysfunction.Advantages \u2022 Ease of use, few extrahepatic factors affect it.Disadvantages \u2022 Does not reliably distinguish among different hepatobiliary diseases. Values may change enough from day to day that it can be difficult to use the serum bile acid concentrations to determine if a change in hepatic function has or is occurring. Analysis \u2022 Measured in serum by either a direct enzymatic method that quantifies total serum 3-alpha-hydroxylated bile acids or uses an RIA procedure that measures specific bile acids. It is important that a validated assay for dogs and cats be used because some methods are not accurate. Values for enzymatic and RIA procedures cannot be compared.Maximum information is obtained by determining a 12-hour fasting preprandial and 2-hour postprandial concentration. Dogs and cats should be fed canned food containing moderate fat content, causing the gallbladder to contract. Preprandial and postprandial concentrations together improve the sensitivity of the test, making it more sensitive than other function tests (e.g., resting serum ammonia concentrations). Values \u2022 Because of different techniques and assays (\u00b5mol/L or \u00b5g/ml), normal values must be established for each laboratory.Danger Values \u2022 None.",

The disorders listed are those that may be more likely to cause a significant increase.

There does not appear to be any advantage of arterial over venous blood. Blood must be drawn into an ice-chilled tube, which is stoppered tightly after filling, immediately put back on ice, and promptly taken to the laboratory. A control sample should be taken at the same time using the same technique. The test must be performed within 20 minutes, or the plasma must be frozen at \u221220\u00ba C, which stabilizes the ammonia concentration for at least 2 days. If an ATT is to be performed, samples for ammonia determination should be taken before and 30 or 45 minutes after administration of NH 4 Cl, 100 mg/kg of body weight.
