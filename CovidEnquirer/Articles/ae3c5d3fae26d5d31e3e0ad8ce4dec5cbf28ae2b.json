The corresponding relative declines in growth rate were 8, 18, and 29%, respectively. Those calves orignated from 28 farms and were reared at one follow-up unit. Calves were studied from between 5 and 70 d of age to 49 t o 120 d of age. The breed of' calves was not reported. Calves were inspected daily; not reported were who made the inspections and what criteria were used to diagnose pneumonia and diarrhea (14% were treated for pneumonia, 15% for diarrhea, and 11% for both). Kleiner et al. (10) recorded birth and end BW at ages ranging from 5 to 37 d for 803 male calves from three different dairy cattle units (breed was not reported). The occurrence of diarrhea was also recorded, but diagnostic criteria were not. For 755 of these calves, information was obtained about the dates and duration of veterinary treatments for diarrhea and pneumonia as well as the BW up t o 140 d of age. The sick calves were treated from the occurrence of first clinical signs until disappearance of the 1996 J Dairy Sci 79:104&1049 1040 signs, and the treatment duration was considered to be the duration of the disease. During this period, the ADG of calves that were treated for pneumonia, diarrhea, or both for >22 d (group 3 ) was 110 g less than the ADG of calves that had <11 d of illness (reference group). Calves that were sick for 11 to 21 d (group 2 ) gained daily 50 g less BW than did calves in the reference group. The calves in groups 2 and 3 could not compensate for reduced growth by 140 d of age. Moreover, Hartmann ( 6 reported the effect of time of diarrhea onset in neonatal calves on the duration of diarrhea by observing 2092 diarrheic calves from three different dairy cattle units during the first 2 wk of life. A 1-d delay in the onset of diarrhea reduced the duration of the disease by about 0.2 d and improved ADG by about 10 g. Healthy controls were not used in that study.",

Only the first occurrences of the diseases and only occurrences during that particular month and during preceding months were considered in the modeling. Farm was forced into the models and was declared to be a random effect. Although farms were not a random sample, they were considered as such because we were not interested in these particular farms. The BW or height at the first visit was used as a covariable in the models. Independent variables used initially in the disease models were from the following groups: calf and colostrum management at birth and shortly after birth, calf care and feeding (such as frequency and volume of milk or milk replacer feeding) after the colostrum feeding period up to 3 mo of age, dam factors (such as presence at first feeding, age, and vaccinations received), first calf housing after the birth and the housing most used during the follow-up period, contacts with different age groups of animals immediately after birth and most common exposure to a specific age group during the follow-up period, and number of housing changes during the follow-up period. Duration of treated pneumonia was considered only in the models of total gain and of ADG of the 3rd mo. If the calf was not diagnosed as having pneumonia during the 3-mo observation period, duration of pneumonia was considered to be 0. The year was divided into four seasons: winter (from December to February), spring (from March to May), summer (from June to August), and fall (from September to November). In the models, winter was further divided into two categories because January through February 1990 and December 1990 were parts of separate season-years.",

In these models, the only independent variables used, other than antibody titers, were the diseases, Outliers were searched for before modeling with checks and by plotting time-dependent variables against time. Outliers were checked against original values on the calf sheets and corrected if necessary. The variable selection was performed in three main steps: univariable analysis, in which the independent variable was excluded if Wald's P test was ~0 . 1 5 ; multivariable analysis, in which the independent variables were excluded if Wald's P test was >0.05; and study of the appropriateness of the model. The appropriateness was assessed with Akaike's information criterion, Schwartz's Bayesian criterion, and log likelihood calculated with REML ( 1 7 1. Inclusion or elimination of the variables was also based on the following criteria: scatter plots of outcome versus each independent variable that showed any indication of relationship, multicollinearity diagnostics [the threshold for condition number of any principal components did not exceed 30 (5, 911, and inclusion or exclusion of a possible confounding variable that did not change the coefficients of the disease estimates in the models for ADG by >20 g, in the model for total BW gain by >0.1 kg, and in the model for height gain by >2 cm. Moreover, an F test in the form of extra sums of squares was used t o test the marginal reduction in the error sum of squares when one variable was added to the regression model ( 1 2 ) . Plausible interaction terms were tested with Wald's P test after selection of the main effects. The assumptions of the models were assessed with residual plots and normal probability plots ( 1 2 1.

The absence of the effect of pneumonia for the ADG during the 2nd mo might have been due to insufficient observations (lack of power). However, the incidence of pneumonia was not importantly lower during the 2nd mo of life than during the 1st or 3rd mo of life, and, also, occurrences of pneumonia during the 1st mo of life were considered in the model for ADG during the 2nd mo. Rather, there might be compensation for the effect of pneumonia during this period ( o r there might not be a reducing effect). Duration of pneumonia was included in the model for total BW gain and was even more significant than pneumonia itself, indicating that the chronic nature of the disease increased its effect in reducing BW. Interestingly, if the clinician had diagnosed disease but the caretaker had not, the effect of this kind of pneumonia on BW gain was not significant. Such calves were not treated for pneumonia. This result may indicate that respiratory disease that is subclinical to the caretaker, even though detectable t o the clinician, may not be of practical importance. Conversely, our sample size might have been too small to detect that association (lack of power). We think that the lack of effect of pneumonia as diagnosed by the caretaker was due to false positive diagnoses. However, we were not able to uncover the true difference, if any, between the effects of pneumonia diagnosed by the clinician and the effects of pneumonia diagnosed by the caretaker with these data; the effects of pooled diagnosis of pneumonia diagnosed by the clinician and pneumonia diagnosed by the caretaker were the same. Diarrhea did not have a significant effect on estimates of growth, which might indicate the ability of the calf to compensate within 1 mo for any loss in growth from diarrhea, The only other disease that significantly reduced growth was umbilical infection, which reduced ADG during the 3rd mo. Umbilical infection was nearly significant ( a = 0.05) in the models for total BW and height gain. The detrimental effect on BW gain has never been reported before, and we think that the chronic inflammatory response of this slowly resolving condition is associated with the effect on growth. Duration of umbilical infection significantly reduced growth also. These two variables could not be kept in the model simultaneously because of multicollinearity.

( 11 reported for feedlot calves that seroconversion from arrival to 28 d postarrival to P. haemolytica cytotoxin, bovine respiratory syncytial, and BVD viruses were predictive of respiratory disease. However, Martin et al. ( 11 also concluded that BW gain or relapse could not be predicted accurately from the serological data. Results from their study and from ours were not comparable, though, because, in their study, the beef calves were weaned and thus were older than calves in the present study.",

In the 1st mo model, the calves of the older dams gained more BW than did the calves of the younger dams, but older dams seemed to have a detrimental effect on the ADG of the 3rd mo. These effects might have been related to FPT or could have been due to genetic differences between heifers and older cows (we are arguing that the FPT overwhelmed the genetic improvement during the 1st mo of life). However, serum Ig as such did not have a significant effect when used instead of FPT. The interaction between BW at first visit and parity of the dam was not significant in either 1st mo or 3rd mo models. For the total BW gain, the effect of age of the dam was missing. In field studies, one has also to consider Type 1 error (finding a significant effect that actually does not exist, Le., rejecting a null hypothesis when that hypothesis is t r u e ) (20) .",
