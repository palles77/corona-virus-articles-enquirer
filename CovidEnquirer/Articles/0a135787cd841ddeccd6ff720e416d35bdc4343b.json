            "text": ". For those without an electron microscope or access to one, commercially available kits offer the chance of detecting the numerically most common virus, the rotavirus. These use either an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or latex agglutination (LA). Both have the disadvantages of giving a proportion of false positives, which may vary between 5 % and 3 5 %, although mostly at the lower end of this range, and of being relatively expensive when used to test a single specimen. Both are best suited to screening large numbers, and are better in this respect than electron microscopy. A further alternative, which does not depend on antibody and is being used increasingly by more laboratories, is polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Viral nucleic acid is separated from other stool constituents by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and the piece(s) of viral nucleic acid detected by silver impregnation (Herring et al., 1982) . The technique works very well with rotaviruses; it should be capable of being extended to other viruses as well as adenoviruses with or without prior endonuclease digestion (Moosai, Carter & Madeley, 1984; Buitenwerf, Louwerens & de Jong, 1985; Willcocks et al., 1988) . How widely applicable this method will prove is still being assessed. None of these methods is very sensitive but, for the diagnosis of acute infections, this is not a problem. The tracing of putative carriers probably requires more sensitive techniques which are not yet available.",

            "text": "None of the viruses involved in diarrhoea and vomiting will grow in routine cell culture and consequently all methods depend on the direct detection of virus or viral components in the stool. All are therefore rapid techniques allowing same day diagnosis, and it should be possible to trace spread within a ward or hospital and take appropriate action. Nevertheless this is probably monitored much less than it could be. Gut viruses frequently spread in closed communities and opportunities for epidemiological detective work are equally common. Tracing their spread provides a good opportunity for collaboration between ward staff and the laboratory, but the findings should be looked at closely. Adult infection does not always cause obvious damage (Wenman et al., 1979) and the immunosuppressed are surprisingly less vulnerable than to respiratory infections.",
