            "text": "Vision assessment in pet laboratory animals is limited in large part by their natural lifestyles and methods of management. Most are confined to familiar quarters and rarely venture into unknown areas. Nocturnal species such as rats, mice, and hamsters may avoid brightly lighted conditions where owners are more apt to observe them. Ocular examination of some species is made difficult by the small size of the eye, restraint difficulties, and the use of large conventional diagnostic instruments. 1 Examination of the external eye and adnexa is greatly aided by the use of magnification (eg, a 20-or 30-diopter [D] condensing lens, a simple pocket magnifier, or head loupe). Several accessory ocular diagnostic tests commonly used in dogs and cats may also be used in small laboratory animals. Fluorescein dye examination of the cornea and nasolacrimal system is possible even in very small animals. Tonometry and Schirmer tear test evaluation are possible in rabbits. Normal intraocular pressure in rabbits is 25 mm Hg. Normal Schirmer tear test values for the rabbit are approximately 5 mm wetting per minute without topical anesthesia. 2 Exfoliative conjunctival cytology collection and examination is both possible and useful in all laboratory species. Note: Topical anesthesia should be used only sparingly in these small animals because systemic toxicity is possible. Fundus examination of rodents and rabbits may be performed by effecting mydriasis with 1% tropicamide (Mydriacyl, Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) and using indirect ophthalmoscopy with a 30-to 40-D indirect condensing lens. Pigmented irides of rodents may resist dilation because of binding of the mydriatic agent to uveal melanin. In such animals, mydriasis may be encouraged by instillation of one drop each of 1% atropine and 10% phenylephrine (AK-Dilate, Akorn, Abita Springs, LA) three times within a 15-minute period.",

The cause of the epiphora is either excessive lacrimation or inadequate tear drainage. Excessive lacrimation results from ocular irritation; a variety of external and intraocular disorders may be responsible. Acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction may accompany or follow chronic rhinitis a n d / o r dacryocystitis that may result from infection (Pasteurella) or possibly dental disease (tooth root inflammation).9 Skull radiography may be indicated. Relief of the obstruction may sometimes be accomplished by nasolacrimal duct irrigation with saline injected through the single inferior punctum with a conventional 22-gauge nasolacrimal cannula or an intravenous catheter. Simple nasolacrimal irrigation may not relieve acquired structural stenosis. Cannulation of the nasolacrimal duct with monofilament nylon (0 to 2-0) may relieve the obstruction; however, cannulation should be done with caution as it is often not possible in normal rabbits because of the natural bends and variable diameter of the duct. 3,5 Presumed bacterial rhinitis and dacryocys- titis may be responsive to systemic antibiotic therapy (enrofloxacin, 10 m g / k g twice a day intramuscularly (IM) or orally; procaine penicillin G, 60,000 I U / k g once a day IM for 10 days). Relapses occur frequently. Note; Prolonged therapy with [Mactam antibiotics may induce potentially fatal enterocolitis in rabbits, s Pasteurella multocida is the most commonly incriminated cause of conjunctivitis in rabbits. 1, 5, 8 This organism may be present in an otherwise normal conjunctival sac or may contaminate the ocular surface by extension from the nasal cavity through the nasolacrimal duct. P multocida also causes a wide variety of other manifestations that include orbital cellulitis, uveitis, pneumonia, otitis media and interna, vulvovaginitis, subcutaneous abscesses, pyometra, orchitis, and generalized septicemia. Major or minor conjunctivitis may accompany any of these signs or may occur in their absence. Conjunctivitis attributable to pasteurellosis in rabbits can be treated with topical chloramphenicol, ciprofloxain, or gentamicin ophthalmic solution or ointment four times daily combined with systemic broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (see above), if ineffective alone. The prognosis for cure of systemic pasteurellosis is poor. Signs of infection resolve with therapy and may recur following stress. Many animals appear to be chronic carriers. Other reported causes of conjunctivitis include Staphylococcus aureus] ~ unsanitary husbandry conditions, 12 chlamydia, 13 and Pseudomohas species.l Blepharitis may be caused by infection with the spirochete Treponema cuniculi, the causative agent of rabbit syphilis. ~,a3 The vulva and prepuce are most commonly affected, but lesions may involve the eyelids, lips, nares, and anus. The disease is transmitted by young rabbits by an infected dam. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of spirochetes and examination of skin scrapings. Infection may be successfully treated with three injections of 40,000 IU per kg of body weight of benzathine penicillin G/procaine penicillin G (Bicillin, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA) given at 7-day intervals. Eradication of treponematosis may require treatment of even asymptomatic animals in the colony. Squamous cell carcinoma mimicking blepharitis has been reported (Fig 2) . 5 Blepharoconjunctivitis may occur as a pri- Rabbits. ~ Primary glaucoma occurs in laboratory rabbits from New Zealand White stock and occasionally in apparently cross-bred pet rabbits. In New Zealand White Rabbits, this condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with incom-plete penetrance. 17 Onset may be as early as the first m o n t h after birth, but it more commonly develops between 3-and 6-months of age. Unilateral or bilateral buphthalmos, generalized corneal edema, and blindness should p r o m p t the clinician to measure intraocular pressure with a Schiotz t o n o m e t e r or an applanation tonometer (Tonopen, Mentor, Norwell, MA) (Fig 3) . Normal intraocular pressure is 25 m m Hg. Medical therapy is of limited benefit. The available topical miotic and [3-blocking drugs may not reduce intraocular pressure soon or adequately enough to preserve vision. The recently introduced topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor dorzolamide (Trusopt, Merck, West Point, PA) may be partially effective when administered two to three times a day. Surgical options include cyclocryotherapy and diode laser cycloablation for potentially sighted eyes and evisceration with silicone prosthesis implantation or enucleation for blind eyes. Serious intraoperative h e m o r r h a g e from the orbital venous sinus is a possible complication of enucleation; more commonly, the bleeding is self-limited before serious consequences ensue.",

Common ocular problems of rats include epiphora, conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, dacryoadenitis, and retinal degeneration.1 Epiphora may be caused by excessive lacrimation or nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Excessive lacrimation may be associated with bacterial or viral conjunctivitis or ocular irritation from soiled bedding. The harderian glands of mice, rats, and other rodents produce porphyrin pigments which stain the periocular hair reddish-brown if it is white or lightly pigmented when epiphora is present (chromodacryorrhea). Owners may mistake this red pigment for \"bloody tears.\" Soiled bedding generates ammonia vapors which act as a direct ocular irritant causing conjunctivitis and predisposing to secondary bacterial infection.

Infection is primarily venereal, with the newborns infected at birth, causing \"inclusion conjunctivitis\" characterized by mild chemosis, follicular formation, and serous ocular discharge. In enzootically infected colonies, outbreaks may be cyclic. Lesions usually resolve within a month and treatment is considered unnecessary. Recovered animals may be resistant to reinfection. Diagnostic confirmation may be achieved by identification to typical intracytoplasmic chlamydiaI inclusions in epithelial cells obtained by conjunctival scraping and stained with Jimenez, Macchiavello's, or other cytologic stain. The zoonotic potential is uncertain.
