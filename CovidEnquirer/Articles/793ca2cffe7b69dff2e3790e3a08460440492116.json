The role of cities in human infectious disease is well established, but less is known about how urban landscapes influence wildlife-pathogen interactions. Here, we draw on recent advances in wildlife epidemiology to consider how environmental changes linked with urbanization can alter the biology of hosts, pathogens and vectors. Although urbanization reduces the abundance of many wildlife parasites, transmission can, in some cases, increase among urbanadapted hosts, with effects on rarer wildlife or those living beyond city limits. Continued rapid urbanization, together with risks posed by multi-host pathogens for humans and vulnerable wildlife populations, emphasize the need for future research on wildlife diseases in urban landscapes.",

Defined as growth in the area and numbers of people inhabiting cities, urbanization generates landscapes dominated by built-up structures for human use [1, 2] . Most studies of the ecological impact of urbanization focus on patterns of biodiversity loss, with declines in species richness from rural areas towards the urban core documented across multiple taxonomic groups [3, 4] . More recently, ecologists have begun to explore the mechanisms by which urbanization affects biodiversity, including processes related to resource competition, altered trophic interactions and disease [2, 5] .",

For example, across 176 foraging sites for wading birds in coastal Florida, a highly pathogenic nematode occurred only at sites disturbed by stream engineering and nutrient fluxes [10] . Many of the above processes have been studied in the context of agricultural land use or forest edge habitats, and are also relevant to pathogen spread in urbanized landscapes.",

To capture a range of mechanisms and changes in their intensity, we consider patterns that occur across the urban-rural gradient (Box 1), in some cases focusing on wildlife species that inhabit both the urban core and surrounding suburban and rural areas. Understanding the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife and, in some cases, humans. Indeed, many pathogens are capable of infecting multiple host species [11, 12] , and some pose serious threats to human health and already vulnerable wildlife populations [13] . Finally, we emphasize several priorities for future research, including identifying those pathogens for which urbanization is likely to have the greatest impact.",

Because most wildlife parasites (especially those restricted to one or a few host species) will also be missing from urban centers, an important consideration is how relevant urbanization is to the ecology of wildlife diseases. The answer involves at least three crucial processes (Table 1) . First, for diseases such as toxoplasmosis or rabies, which affect urbanadapted wildlife species, infection dynamics can change across a gradient of habitats, in some cases leading to increased prevalence in urban or suburban environments. Second, rarer wildlife species, such as many wood warblers or flying squirrels and other small rodents, which persist within city parks or surrounding natural areas, can be affected negatively by pathogens maintained in urbanadapted hosts (Box 2). The increased dominance of a few key host species, and conditions that favor interspecific contact rates, could cause declines of rarer wildlife through competition mediated by multi-host parasites [12, 16] .",

Abundant resources not prone to seasonal fluctuations, either through accidental (e.g. household waste) or intentional (e.g. bird feeders) provisioning, support these populations. Such high population densities can elevate contact rates within and among wildlife species, and favor the transmission of parasites spread by direct contact or oral-fecal routes (Table 1 ). In response to resource provisioning, increased birth rates among urban-adapted species could provide further opportunities for parasite transmission by increasing the abundance of susceptible juvenile hosts (e.g. Ref. [9] ).",

From a quantitative perspective, human population density and impervious surface coverage are commonly used to quantify the degree of urbanization and facilitate among-site comparisons. Census data on socioeconomic conditions at study sites can provide additional information relevant to underlying ecosystem processes. For example, higher family incomes and older buildings were strong predictors of plant species diversity in the Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona, USA [51] .

Conducting analyses at multiple scales is essential for detecting the relative importance of key landscape variables. In the case of infectious disease risk, host abundance and diversity, vector activity and pathogen survival in the environment will probably be affected by urban landscape measures at different spatial scales [52] ; these scaling patterns will further depend on host dispersal abilities, host and vector habitat preferences, and the mode of parasite transmission. feces. Although human cases are widely restricted to rural areas in northern Europe, where outdoor work and pet ownership are significant risk factors [25] , migrations of infected foxes into urban areas might elevate human infection risk in cities. Current evidence suggests that there is little impact to humans living in urban areas; however, because E. multilocularis has a long incubation period (decades in some patients), long-term surveillance will be required to assess shifts in human infections associated with fox movements. The red fox-E. multilocularis system further emphasizes that multiple mechanistic drivers associated with urbanization can influence patterns of infectious disease risk. One recent study showed that, although fox populations are increasing in Zurich, Switzerland, the prevalence of E. multilocularis within those populations is not [26] . Transmission of E. multilocularis could decline if foxes consume fewer intermediate hosts (as prey) in favor of human-generated resources in cities.",

            "text": "Resource provisioning in urban environments also affects host susceptibility and responses to both existing and introduced pathogens, mediated through effects on physical condition and immune defenses. For example, animals that are malnourished owing to low protein intake can become immunosuppressed, shedding more parasite eggs in feces and suffering higher rates of mortality following infection [27] . Thus, although elevated food resources for urban-adapted species could increase contact rates and pathogen transmission, supplemental feeding might also improve host condition, increase immunity to infection and decrease pathogen impacts on host survival and reproduction. [18, 20] Passeriformes and other vertebrate hosts WNV North America Seroprevalence in wild songbirds higher in areas densely populated by humans; non-passerine bird diversity associated with lower infection rates in mosquitoes and humans [21, 64] Resource provisioning and contact rates within urban-adapted species Raccoon Procyon lotor Baylisascaris procyonis (raccoon roundworm); other endoparasites Northeast USA Higher raccoon abundance and birth rates in urbansuburban areas; clumped resources increase withinspecies contact rates, leading to higher parasite richness and increased B. procyonis prevalence [9, 23] House Figure Ib) , a species endemic to North America [53] . Although reductions in red squirrel populations can result from direct competition for resources between the two species [53] , gray squirrels also introduced a squirrel paramyxovirus that is highly lethal to red squirrels (but causes no discernible pathology in gray squirrels; [54] ). Results from a model developed by Tompkins et al. [55] support the conclusion that observed red squirrel declines are consistent with both direct and indirect competition with gray squirrels ( Figure  IIa-c) . Using a stochastic individual-based model and applying this model to real landscapes, Rushton et al. [56] explored the role of the paramyxovirus virus in red squirrel population reductions. The results indicate that apparent competition between red and gray squirrels led to local loss of red squirrels under a large range of parameter values and assuming low levels (10%) of infection in gray squirrels. The population-level effects of the pathogen were most strongly influenced by interspecific encounter rates ( Figure IId) , suggesting that increased contact between infected and healthy individuals could raise the risk of disease-mediated population loss. Such encounter rates could increase around urban areas if food provisioning leads to greater contacts within and between host species. The introduction of this urban-adapted animal species and the subsequent spread of paramyxovirus in red squirrels illustrates the potential synergistic effects of urbanization and pathogenmediated competition on the abundance of more vulnerable wildlife hosts. Pathogen exposure, pollution, and stress Cities serve as significant hubs of pathogen introductions (Box 3) and as sources of infection for wildlife that exist at the periphery of urban centers [28, 29] . For example, infectious oocytes of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, are shed in the fecal material of domesticated and wild felids. This pathogen also causes infections in other mammals associated with both urban landscapes and more natural habitats (e.g. Ref. [30] ). For example, Toxoplasma infections have been linked to southern sea otter Enhydra lutris nereis mortalities off the coast of California, USA [31] . Infection rates in otter populations were three times higher in areas of maximum freshwater runoff along the Californian shoreline, most of which were associated with regions of high human density. This association is probably a result of water contamination by cat feces and parasite amplification by benthic filter feeders that comprise a major component of sea otter diets [31] .",

Several vector-borne diseases might respond to temperature changes associated with urbanization, particularly as these areas can also provide irrigated regions necessary for vector reproduction [2] . Specifically, more moderate winters and the dampened seasonality of urban centers could increase the survival, breeding success and activity of arthropod vectors that are essential for the transmission of many pathogens. In Stockholm, Sweden, for example, such conditions have lengthened the period of activity in the tick Ixodes ricinus, coinciding with an elevated incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in rodents and humans [40] .

Surveillance programs targeted towards zoonotic agents would improve the ability of scientists to detect new agents entering cities and to document infections of pre-existing pathogens in novel host species. Also needed are studies that identify host-pathogen systems restricted to wildlife for which urbanization has significant impacts. Often overlooked for zoonotic diseases, these pathogens can have important consequences for animal species already threatened by other factors [13, 16] .",

For example, to what degree do air pollution, noise and other environmental stressors influence wildlife susceptibility to infection, and are these effects counterbalanced by increased food resources or milder winter climates in cities? How does host immunity interact with physical landscape characteristics that alter host contact rates? In terms of vector-borne diseases, better information is needed regarding how biting arthropods are influenced by the heat island effect, distribution of breeding sites and shifts in host-species availability across urban-rural gradients.",

Within the past decade, two cities in the USA were added to the Long-Term Ecological Research site network (http://www.lternet.edu/; funded by the National Science Foundation): Baltimore, MD and Phoenix, AZ [1] . Together with urban research sites in Europe, Asia and Latin America, these cities can serve as grounds for testing hypotheses concerning the effects of host species diversity, food provisioning and environmental variables on the spread of wildlife diseases [20, 22] . In turn, studies replicated across multiple locations can begin to explore how factors such as wildlife community composition, pollution and urban microclimates are affected by human population density, socioeconomic variables and land-use patterns.",

Unlike other land-use changes that can influence wildlife disease emergence (e.g. forest fragmentation or agricultural intensification), the extreme changes that accompany urbanization probably cause declines or losses of most wildlife species and their associated parasites. However, the debate over positive versus negative effects of urbanization on the prevalence and impacts of wildlife diseases is likely to intensify as more research is published. Better understanding of the types of wildlife pathogens that do persist in urbanized areas, and mechanisms that cause increases in prevalence or impacts, can point to new strategies for limiting the risk of human and wildlife exposure in urban centers, and will improve our understanding of the ecological drivers behind spatial variation in pathogen occurrence.",
