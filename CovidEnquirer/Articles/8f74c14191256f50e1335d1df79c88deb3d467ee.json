            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) has been successfully applied in suppression of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. To circumvent the problem that mutation in HBV genome may result in resistance when siRNA is further developed as an anti-viral drug, in this study, we established a dual small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression system, which could simultaneously express two different siRNA molecules that can specifically target two genes. To test the effectiveness of this system, we applied this new approach to express simultaneously two different 21-bp hairpin siRNA duplexes that specifically attack the HBs and HBx genes of HBV, respectively, in Bel-7402 and HepG2.2.15 cells. Results indicated that dual siRNA could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and HBx gene by 83.7% and 87.5%, respectively, based on luciferase assays. In addition, dual siRNA molecules were able to significantly reduce the amount of HBV core associated DNA, which is considered as an intracellular replicative intermediate, and the viral DNA in culture supernatant. Therefore, this dual siRNA system provides a more powerful tool for the study of gene function and implicates a potential application in the treatment of viral infection.",

This RNA silencing mechanism was first described in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster (Fire et al., 1988) . It has many similarities to the posttranscriptional gene silencing in plants. Specific inhibition of cellular mRNA by RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic 21-to 23-nucleotide double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Elbashir et al., 2001; Paul et al., 2002) or, alternatively, by the transcrip-tion of siRNA from a DNA construct driven by the RNA polymerase cassette (Brummelkamp et al., 2002) . These findings open up a new field for the analysis and control of the processes of gene expression, and perhaps pathogen infection.",

            "text": "Eight genotypes (A-H) of HBV have been described. The number of HBV carriers worldwide has been estimated to be more than 400 million. These individuals have a 15-25% risk of developing liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Kao and Chen, 2002) . Although a few drugs were developed against HBV infection, the success rate of these treatments, however, is low and frequently infections reoccur (Carreno et al., 1992; Lai et al., 1997) . The fact that RNAi can be applied for blocking the replication of HBV in several reports provided insights into the field of controlling infectious human hepatitis. Nevertheless, mutations in HBV genome may result in viral resistance to siRNA. It has been reported that HIV-1 can escape from RNAi-mediated inhibition due to nucleotide change in the genome (Das et al., 2004) . One strategy to circumvent the problem is to choose target in the relatively conserved DNA sequence. The other approach is to produce multiple siRNAs that target different sites or genes on the viral genome. We here established a system that can express two siRNA duplexes simultaneously and target the S and X genes of HBV, respectively. To study the effects of dual RNAi on HBV gene expression in a cell culture model, we used a derivative of the human HepG2 hepatoma cell line, HepG2.2.15, which has been stably transformed with several copies of the HBV genome and used as an in vitro model for HBV replication. The effects of dual siRNA system on HBV gene expression were investigated in this study.",

Primers were annealed and cloned into BamHI-HindIII sites of the pSilencer2.1-U6 vector. In order to construct a useful tool to choose the most effective siRNA molecules, we created a quick screening vector plucF by fusing the targeted sequence and the reporter luciferase gene together to produce recombinant plucF plasmid, which could express HBs-luciferase or HBx-luciferase fusion mRNAs. Therefore, we can initially select the suitable siRNA duplexes rapidly by simply analyzing the activities of lucifearse. By using this approach, we have identified two siRNA molecules (HBS 1 siRNA and HBS 2 siRNA) having significant impact on the HBs-luciferase fusion gene expression and one siRNA duplex (HBX 2 siRNA) having effects on the expression of HBx-luciferase fusion gene. This provides a quick approach to select effective siRNA in the study of gene expression and function analysis.",

The effects of dual siRNA system on HBV gene expression and viral replication were studied thoroughly by the analyzing the levels of viral protein production through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the levels of viral RNA expression by semi-quantitated RT-PCR analysis. All results indicated that HBS 1 siRNA, HBS 2 siRNA, and HBX 2 siRNA had significant reduction effects on viral mRNA expression, and viral protein production.",

Our strategies to address such potential problems are to choose targets in the relatively conserved DNA sequences and to generate multiple siRNA molecules that can target different sites or genes on the viral genome. To test our approach, in this study we established a system that can simultaneously express two siRNA duplexes from a single vector that can attack the S and X genes of HBV, respectively. Results from luciferase activity assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and semiquantitated RT-PCR analysis were consistently showed that the dual siRNA molecules had synergetic effects or more efficient on the targeted viral protein production and HBs and HBx gene expression comparing to that of the single siRNA molecules. More importantly, dual siRNA could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and HBx gene by 83.7% and 87.5%, respectively. Therefore, this dual siRNA system could provide a more powerful tool for the study of gene function and could be used as a potential application in the treatment of viral infection.",

Current therapies of HBV infection including immune modulators such as interferon Alfa, or nucleoside analogs such as lamivudine have provided some degree of cures, but the efficiency of treatment was limited. As a potential therapy, siRNA seems to be a hopeful alternative strategy. We believe that our approach presented in this study could be broadly used. For example, it could be used to generate more than two siRNAs duplexes that could silent more genes in order to study the interactions of genes and their functions. Such strategies of constructing multiple-siRNA vectors can confront the evading mechanism of virus infections. Obviously, this cocktail approach would be benefit to application of siRNA therapy in viral infections, especially to those viruses with high mutation rate. In addition, this approach could also used to deal with two or more viruses, which are especially useful in the treatment of co-infections by two or more pathogens, such as HBV-HIV and HCV-HIV. We are in the process of testing these approaches.",
