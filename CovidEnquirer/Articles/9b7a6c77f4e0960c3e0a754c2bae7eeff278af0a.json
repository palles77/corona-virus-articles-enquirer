In addition to increasing the probability of correctly identifying the etiology of the patient's illness, good communication is essential for safety, especially when infections due to Francisella tularensis, Brucella spp., Macacine herpesvirus-1 (cercopithecine herpesvirus type 1; herpesvirus simiae; B virus) and other highly biohazardous agents are under consideration. 2 In those cases in which the pathogen is a potential agent of bioterrorism or is uncommon in humans, even a well-equipped clinical microbiology laboratory may be unable to perform the necessary testing on-site.",

Transmission of rabies to humans follows bite, scratch and, far less often, inhalation of aerosolized saliva. Bats also account for many cases of rabies in livestock. Other Lyssaviruses that have been transmitted to humans from bats include European bat Lyssavirus-1, European bat Lyssavirus-2 and Australian bat Lyssavirus. 18 Most recent reports of human rabies from bat exposure find no clear evidence of a documented bat bite. Transmission apparently occurs from inadvertent bites or from unrecognized contact with the bat saliva. This forms the rationale for the administration of rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine when a bat is found in the room upon awaking from sleep, in the room of a small child, or in the room of an intoxicated or mentally challenged person 19 (see Chapter 171). However, given the large number of people (approximately 2.7 million with bedroom exposure and without a bite) who would have to be treated with rabies immune globulin and the rabies vaccine in order to prevent a single case of human rabies, this recommendation is controversial. 20 As noted above, bats have been found to be reservoirs of the zoonotic paramyxoviruses Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Menangle virus. 21 In addition, after decades of active research, bats have been identified as the reservoirs of both Ebola virus 22 and Marburg virus. 23 Outbreaks of histoplasmosis due to Histoplasma capsulatum have been associated with exposure to bat guano in caves, after disturbing piles of bat guano in old buildings 24 and clearing debris from a bridge. 25 While bacteria that are established as pathogens of humans, including members of the genera Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Leptospira, and Pasteurella, have been isolated from bats, transmission from bats to humans of these organisms has not been documented.",

A case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in an ostrich farm worker who was involved in the slaughter of ostriches, Struthio camelus, and handled the fresh blood and tissues of the birds, has been reported. There were numerous adult Hyalomma ticks on the ostriches and he likely was infected either directly due to skinning the ostriches or as a result of the presence of the ticks on the ostriches. 80 Fish In addition to the normal flora of the fish, a wound can become infected with environmental bacteria. The species of bacteria that live in water are dependent on both salinity and temperature. Estuarine and freshwater bacteria include members of the genera Vibrio, Aeromonas and Plesiomonas. As a result, the etiologic agents isolated from an infected wound from a fish bite, spine, or fin injury that occurs in salt water may well be different from one that occurs in fresh water. The normal flora of teeth in salt-water sharks includes, for example, Vibrio spp., including V. harveyi (formerly V. carchariae), an organism that was the cause of infection following the bite of a great white shark. 81 of mongoose and accounts for a significant number of cases of human exposure to rabies in the Caribbean.
