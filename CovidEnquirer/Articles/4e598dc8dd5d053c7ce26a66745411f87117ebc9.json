PON1 was measured by spectrophotometric assays using three different substrates: p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNA), phenyl acetate (PA) and 5-thiobutil butyrolactone (TBBL), in order to evaluate possible differences between them. The PA and TBBL assays for PON1 and the assay for TAC were validated, providing acceptable precision and linearity although PA and TAC assays showed limit of detection higher than the values found in some cats with FIP. Cats with FIP and other inflammatory conditions showed lower PON1 values compared with a group of healthy cats with the three assays used, and cats with FIP showed significant decreased TAC concentrations. This study demonstrated the existence of oxidative stress in cats with FIP.",

In this situation the organism is unable to detoxify reactive oxygen species, which accumulate, producing a harmful effect on the functional and structural integrity of biological tissues (Yilmaz, 2012) . Cats seem to be more susceptible to oxidative stress and damage, probably influenced by the particular spleen structure of this species (Christopher et al., 1995; Harvey and Kaneko, 1977) , and a situation of oxidative stress has been demonstrated in various diseases in this species such as diabetes mellitus (Webb and Falkowski, 2009) , chronic renal failure (Keegan and Webb, 2010) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection (Webb et al., 2008) . However, to the author's knowledge there are no studies about oxidative stress in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a viral disease resulting from feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection.",

In humans, a reduction of PON1 activity has been reported in several pathologic conditions, including bacterial and viral infections (Farid and Horii, 2012) . In addition, PON1 is associated with inflammation, being considered as a negative acute phase protein in several species. Feingold et al. (1998) reported a reduced hepatic synthesis of this enzyme in hamsters during the acute phase response. Decreases have been also described in cattle (Bionaz et al., 2007) , laboratory animals (Franco-Pons et al., 2008) , humans (Novak et al., 2010) , horses (Turk et al., 2011) and dogs (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012a (Tvarijonaviciute et al., , 2012b .

Each pool was analyzed six times in a single assay run. The inter-assay CV was determined by analyzing the same pools in six separate runs on different days. Sera were frozen in aliquots, and only the vials needed for each run were used, to avoid possible changes due to repetitive thawing and freezing. Linearity was evaluated using the method of linearity under dilution. The pool serum with high values of PON1 and TAC was diluted on a two-fold basis with sample buffer and assayed by triplicate. The results were compared with those expected by linear regression analysis. The limit of detection of the assay (the lowest concentration of each analyte that could be distinguished from a specimen with a value of zero) was calculated as the mean plus 2 standard deviations for data generated from 20 replicate determinations of the zero standard (sample buffer).",

In the PON1 assay, both methods using PA and TBBL showed precise results and were able to measure PON1 in a linear manner, similar to the results previously reported in dogs (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012b) . Although one cat with FIP showed a PON1 value below the limit of detection when PA was used. The TAC assay was precise and linear with values higher than the limit of detection of the assay. However, 5 cats with FIP and one cat with other inflammatory condition showed TAC values under the calculated limits of detection. The existence of values lower than the limit of the detection should be considered as a limitation for the PON1 assay using PA as substrate and for the TAC assay, especially in cases of FIP or other inflammatory conditions where low values are expected.",

            "text": "To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report measuring PON1 and TAC in cats with FIP and in inflammatory conditions. A significant decrease in PON1 activity with the three substrates was observed in both groups of diseased cats. The only report found about PON1 in cats studied the possible oxidative stress associated with obesity (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012c) . There are several reasons that could explain a decrease in PON1 activity in cats with FIP. One of these reasons is oxidative stress, corroborated by the low TAC concentration in these cats. Oxidative stress is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of some human viruses. For example, hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and reduced glutathione activity (Paracha et al., 2013) and HIV infection decreases PON1 activity (Parra et al., 2007 (Parra et al., , 2010 and TAC (Suresh et al., 2009) . The presence of inflammation and increase in inflammatory cytokines that appear in cats with FIP (Regan et al., 2009 ) could also explain the decreased PON1 activity, since it is considered part of the innate immune system (Chun et al., 2004) and is a negative acute phase protein that decreases during inflammation (Novak et al., 2010; Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012a) , as it can be seen in our study in the group of cats with an inflammatory condition. Inflammation results in the loss of PON1 from HDL-cholesterol molecules, to be replaced by SAA (Kappelle et al., 2011) . This could explain the increase in SAA and the decrease in PON1 demonstrated in cats with FIP in this study, indicating a pronounced inflammatory response, and the significant (although weak) negative correlation observed between SAA and PON1. SAA analysis was performed in order to assess the presence of an inflammatory response in all the cats used in this study. Although AGP has been reported to be the APP of choice in cats with FIP we chose SAA since it is an automated method, so its measurement is easier than AGP, which determination is currently made in most lab by radial immune diffusion technique. Besides, it has been demonstrated that SAA shows similar response in FIP cats than AGP does (Giordano et al., 2004) .",

Compared with PA, it is less toxic and has a lower limit of quantification (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012b) . In addition, pNA assay can also be automated, thereby allowing higher specimen throughput and avoiding pipetting errors, which results in higher precision than TBBL which exceeded the recommended limit of 15% for inter-assay measurements (Guidance for Industry: Bioanalytical Method Validation, US, 2001). In a study performed in dogs, higher significance in the differences between dogs with oxidative damage and healthy dogs was found with pNA compared with PA or TBBL (Tvarijonaviciute et al., 2012b) . Another important limitation for TBBL use is that this substrate is not commercially available.",
