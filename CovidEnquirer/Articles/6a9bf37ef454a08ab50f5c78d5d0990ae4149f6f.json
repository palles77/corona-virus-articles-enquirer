In most developing countries TM is easily accessible and affordable to the larger proportion of the populations relative to Western medicine (WM). In Africa, it is estimated that about 80% of the populations rely on TM for their primary health care needs (WHO, 2008) . In the developed world TM is used by a relatively smaller proportion of the populations than the proportion that relies on WM. Consequently, in the developed countries TM is referred to as \"complementary\" or \"alternative\" medicine (CAM) since it complements WM which is accessed by a larger proportion of the populations. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2008) , \"Traditional medicine refers to health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-being.\" * Tel.: +255 22 2700018; fax: +255 22 2700380.

The non-spiritual component is generally referred to as herbalism. It should be made very clear that this paper is not discussing the spiritual component of ATM that involves divine healing based on religious faith which is believed to involve supernatural spiritual powers. However, in most cases in practice there is lack of clarity as to whether a Traditional Healer is practicing as a herbalist or as a divine healer. It is such ambiguity that tends to shroud the practice of ATM with so much sacredness that any attempt to question anything associated with the practice is perceived by some people not only as a taboo but also as one of the manifestations of neocolonialism.",

According to Tangwa, ethical principles that emanated from atrocities committed by Western medical practitioners should not be used to assess whether some actions of African traditional practitioners are right or wrong because they did not take part in the atrocities (Tangwa, 2007) . The current paper, which focuses on ATM, will address the issue of whether or not the African Traditional Healers conduct any research, be it scientific or 'African traditional', before they come up with new treatments. If they do, then there are ethical requirements pertaining to conduction of research in patients which should be met (CIOMS, 2002;  World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki, 2008) . Two case studies that capture research approaches that were used during Edward Jenner's era in Western medicine and approaches that are currently being used by some African Traditional Healers will be discussed. The aim is to highlight firstly the need for properly designed research to improve both traditional and Western medicines and secondly, to flag some ethical issues surrounding the practice of and 'research' in ATM. The case studies illustrate the fact that research methods that were considered acceptable centuries of years ago should always be reviewed and improved as part of efforts to enhance protection of the well being of patients in particular and mankind in general.",

When the HIV/AIDS pandemic started affecting his country, he also started 'diagnosing' HIV infection in some of his patients. Using his knowledge and experience as a Traditional Healer, he tried some of his traditional medicines on his HIV/AIDS patients but without informing them that the medicines were being tested. After the 'trials', the healer was convinced that the medicines were effective not only for treating but curing HIV/AIDS patients. Since his medicines were very affordable compared with the Western medicines, he soon became the first port of call for many patients seeking treatment and cure for HIV/AIDS. He became a very rich and famous person in his country and in neighbouring countries.",

On the other hand, people calling for properly designed scientific research to be conducted on the traditional medicines argued that if the traditional medicines that were being claimed to treat or cure HIV/AIDS were truly effective, the ever rising disease burden and mortalities due to HIV/AIDS in Africa would have been brought under control since the traditional medicines were widely accessible to those who needed them. Most importantly, they argued that the risk of bias in the observations and deductions made by the healer who would benefit from payments by patients was unacceptably high.",

Western medical practice and research: from Edward Jenner type of research to randomised controlled trials Case study 1 captures research methodology that was used ages ago, and was acceptable then but is no longer acceptable nowadays. Today, a single medical doctor may not simply decide to test something in a patient or in patients without involving other people with relevant expertise that the doctor may not have. There is now a requirement that any testing of anything in human beings should be explained in a protocol in order to enable peer review (CIOMS, 2002 guideline 2; World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki, 2008) . The review of the protocol is meant to ensure that firstly there are no flaws in the planned methodology that may compromise the usefulness of the findings and secondly that the safety of the humans who will take part will not be compromised. The most important requirement for research nowadays is the informed consent. Many international and national ethical guidelines or legal frameworks clearly stipulate that obtaining informed consent is a prerequisite for research. For instance, the CIOMS guideline 4 states that \"For all biomedical research involving humans the investigator must obtain the voluntary informed consent of the prospective subject or, in the case of an individual who is not capable of giving informed consent, the permission of a legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. Waiver of informed consent is to be regarded as uncommon and exceptional, and must in all cases be approved by an ethical review committee (CIOMS, 2002) .\"",

If there is no proven standard treatment for the disease, then the doctor has to explain to the patient that the medicine available is still being tested.

But nobody knows whether or not he had conducted other 'experiments' detrimental to the health of his research subjects.

Although one school of thought may want to refer to that systematic assessment of traditional herbs as 'African traditional research methods', it could be argued that the systematic approach was basically scientific, more or less similar to the approach that Jenner used, and was devised by the African Traditional Healers themselves. For instance, one approach used by the Traditional Healers long time ago was to observe herbs that were never eaten at all by animals, and such herbs were suspected to be poisonous and would be avoided by the Traditional Healers. Long time ago there were no means of testing toxicity; hence such an approach was logical during that era. The point is that centuries of years ago African Traditional Healers developed methods of assessing safety and medicinal properties of herbs that were logical and acceptable during that era, but the methods should change with time.",

The implication is that there was some form of research that involved testing of the traditional medicines for HIV/AIDS, albeit without disclosure of such 'research' activities to the patients. The traditional medicines that were being given to people living with HIV/AIDS were not free of charge; the Traditional Healer benefited financially from the sale of the medicines. It therefore means that there was conflict of interest since the Traditional Healer testing the medicines was the one who interpreted the findings and eventually benefited financially from the sale of the medicines. Although the medicines were affordable to the majority of the people needing them, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in most African countries meant that there were large numbers of people needing such medicines, which translated into huge financial gains for the healer relative to ordinary members of the community.",
