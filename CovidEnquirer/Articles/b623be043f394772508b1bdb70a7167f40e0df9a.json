The extent of superinfecting virus propagation depends on the time of superinfection; there is 90% exclusion by 4 hr after the initial infection, and more than 99% by 6 hr. When superinfection is attempted at 6 hr after infection, the superinfecting virus is incapable of carrying out DNA replication or early gene transcription, demonstrating that an early event in the virus life cycle is inhibited. The rate of adsorption of the superinfecting virus is unaltered which shows that exclusion is affected at a point between adsorption and early gene transcription.",

In the first model, after the initial infection, an early protein accumulates which is directly responsible for preventing the penetration, uncoating, or transcription of the superinfecting virus. This model is consistent with the need for early gene expression from the infecting virus and the observed kinetics of exclusion. In the second model, the expression of early genes from the initial infecting virus activates a host anti-viral activity which prevents either uptake or early gene expression from the superinfecting virus. Since replication of the initial infecting virus proceeds unabated, we must assume that the replication of the initial virus is beyond the control of this putative anti-viral agent. The final model recognizes that vaccinia has evolved to initiate replication in an uninfected cell and that the physiology of the infected cell may be substantially altered by the early events which occur during the initial infection. As a result of this initial infection, a superinfecting virus encounters a cellular environment which may be unfavorable. In this model, exclusion is an indirect consequence of early gene expression from the initial infecting virus.",

First, genetic experiments requiring superinfection are not possible with vaccinia virus if superinfection is carried out later than 2 hr postinfection. Second, superinfection exclusion can have an affect on virus plaque assays. For example, in plaque assays carried out at a high particle to PFU ratio, i.e., low dilutions of ts mutants plated at the nonpermissive temperature, exclusion will cause revertant virus to form small plaques, because although the mutant virus cannot replicate at the nonpermissive temperature, it will infect a cell and prevent superinfection by the revertant virus. Third, it is worth considering superinfection exclusion as an additional property of the vaccinia virus-infected cell, and realizing that a full understanding of the molecular basis of exclusion will provide a greater appreciation of the vaccinia virus life cycle. Fourth, since superinfection exclusion requires early gene expression, one might be able to take advantage of this observation to select for conditional lethal muta-tions of vaccinia virus altered in functions required for early gene expression.",

            "text": "In othervirus systems, interference with superinfecting virus replication is well documented. Influenza virus synthesizes a neuraminidase which destroys the cellsurface receptor required for virus infection (Palese et al,, 1974) . Corona virus express an esterase which may carry out a similar function (Vlasak et a/., 1989) . In the case of herpes virus, the cell-surface expression of glycoprotein D inhibits superinfection by preventing virus penetration but not adsorption (Johnson and Spear, 1989) . It is often argued that these exclusion mechanisms prevent reinfection by progeny virus and result in their release into the infected organism. Perhaps the exclusion phenomenon described for vaccinia virus serves a similar function.",
