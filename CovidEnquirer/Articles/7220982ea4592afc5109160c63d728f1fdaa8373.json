We analyzed the research and development (R&D) budget of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. Methods: The 2018 MOHW R&D Project integrated implementation plan was used to analyze the R&D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk factors were compared with corresponding budgets. Results: In 2018, the MOHW major R&D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R&D budget, 35.9% was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were targeted for R&D. Conclusions: It would be difficult to say that current R&D allocations focus to minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R&D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a similar finding for risk factors R&D. A novel approach for allocating government R&D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the Korean population should be considered.",

            "text": "The year 2017 was significant for Korean health policy. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW), under President Moon's government, established new policies to promote healthy living in Korea. 1,2 These policies included \"enhancement of customized welfare services by life-cycle phase,\" \"establishment of health insurance system centered on people,\" and \"strengthening responses to demographic crisis.\" The main investment directions of research and development (R&D) for the MOHW in connection with these policies are to promote new and more advanced medical industries, to reinforce public R&D, and to advance human-centered disease research (Fig. 1) . Although the growth of the government's total R&D budget is slowing, the R&D budget of the MOHW has steadily increased over the past seven years because of the recognition that health is vital to people's quality of life. The R&D budget of the MOHW is divided by 2 categories which are major R&D budget and general R&D budget. General R&D budget is used for institutional expenses and policy studies and so on. The major R&D budget of the MOHW was USD 435.1 million for 32 projects in 2018. 2 Previous research on principles for fund allocation identified some underlying factors: varying needs among recipients, competing goals in different sectors (university, industry, and national laboratories), and specific emerging policy issues. 3, 4 Evidence suggests that all these elements play a role in funding allocation. 4 In Korea, since the first case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was reported to the government in May 2015, there have been many changes in the government's support of R&D. There has also been an increase in the awareness of the importance of health system strengthening as a prerequisite to providing essential medical services during each stage of life. 1 To adapt to an ever-changing environment as well as to achieve the correct levels of resource allocation, decision makers should consider using a coherent, disciplined, and comprehensive approach for deciding on an allocation of R&D funds. One way to assess prioritization in health care budget is to match measures of the burden of disease, such as disability adjusted life years (DALYs), along with economic burden and budget prioritization. 5 The aim of this study, then, was to investigate whether the MOHW's R&D budget has responded to the burden of diseases in Korea.",

Data for the burden of disease in Korea were taken from the results of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. 6,7 This study was funded by the MOHW to contextualize the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for the Korean population. The KNBD study used modification to make estimations for the Korean population. For example, the study used Korean-specific disease classification systems and data sources, such as claims data and disability weights specific to the Korean population.

            "text": "Because the MOHW plays a significant normative role in health policy formulation in Korea, we chose to zero in on MOHW funding. Health priorities that underpin the 2018 MOHW budget are shown in Fig. 1 . 9 In practice, several departments and agencies operate the R&D funds under a delegation of authority from the MOHW, the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), the National Rehabilitation Center, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Center, and the hi-tech medical complex. Data for the R&D budget were taken from the 2018 MOHW R&D Project's integrated implementation plan. 10 We analyzed the contents of the plan to identify the appropriate group of diseases budget related. Table 1 shows how we aggregated budget lines from the implementation plan. This study used the disease classification systems from the KNBD study. For example, diseases are classified into three level 1 groups: group 1 comprises communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; group 2 comprises non-communicable diseases; and group 3 is injuries and violence. Each level 1 disease group is further classified into additional level 2 disease groups, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis, diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, meningitis, other common infectious diseases, and so on. We identified budget lines for levels 1 and 2 diseases, which are communicable diseases including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; as well as non-communicable diseases such as neoplasm, chronic respiratory diseases, mental and behavioral disorders, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders; and then finally for the injury and violence burden of disease clusters. 7 Every fund was classified in the most detailed manner. But some funds, such as the one for big data in healthcare, was assigned to the non-disease specific clusters. Similarly, wide budget lines that could not be classified in one level 2 disease group were also assigned to the non-disease specific group. We then categorized a wide range of disease clusters using the budget groups that could meet the burden of disease in terms of the numbers of DALYs. We also investigated whether the MOHW R&D budget allocations varied according to the economic burden of disease. Also, some budgets target risk factors rather than disease group. Therefore, the DALYs from risk factors in 2013 and the risk factors budget are also compared. 6 The USD is converted using the average exchange rate of 2017.",

Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the 2018 MOHW fund allocations across the diseases categories. In this figure, R&D funds and the burden of disease in Korea were not correlated. For example, much part of the MOHW R&D funds were allocated to upgrading the national system for responding to communicable diseases, focusing on prevention of variant infectious disease inflow and spread and on-site responses. However, communicable diseases in Korea only accounted for 2.8% of DALYs in 2015. 7 Non-communicable diseases, on the other hand, accounted for more than 87% of Korean DALYs but were only allocated 64.1% of the MOHW R&D funds. The most salient findings, though, were in the injuries and violence disease group. There was no MOHW funding whatsoever for this disease group. However, injuries and violence such as self-harm, interpersonal injury, or transport injury accounted for 10.1% of the total 2015 DALYs in the KNBD study, even higher than those of the communicable disease category. 6 To further investigate whether the economic burden and funds allocation are aligned, we also compared the differences between them. We noted that the funds were also skewed when compared to economic burden. The economic burden of injury and violence was 9.1%, but injury and violence did not receive any portion of the MOHW total funding (Fig. 2) .",

For example, most of the R&D funds were focused on technology enhancement and industrial service development, which were assigned to non-disease specific budgets in Table 1 . When the US allocates federal funds, various factors come into play at multiple levels. These factors can include economic investment models, human judgement, specialized knowledge, experience, and understanding of the R&D processes. 3, 15 In Korea, on the other hand, it appears that national values and circumstances are currently at odds, and there is a need to establish a reasonable long-term strategy for R&D allocations.",

Since 2000, as patterns of disease have become more chronic and diversified, the Korean government's health care policy has been undergoing a transformation, from a previous emphasis on the biomedical model to preventive policies and a more active health management model. At the same time, the expansion of international travel and the corresponding increase in domestic exposure to foreign infectious diseases elevates the importance of having well developed, coordinated systems (e.g., emergency quarantine systems) for preventing the spread of infectious disease. In addition to globalization, rapid environmental changes are also altering patterns of infectious disease in Korea. New infectious diseases are emerging, like avian flu and MERS, which we are able to identify as a result of more advanced diagnostic medical technologies.",
