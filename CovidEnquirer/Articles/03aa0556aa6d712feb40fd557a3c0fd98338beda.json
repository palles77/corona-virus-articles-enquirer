            "text": "A prospective cohort study was undertaken to determine calf-level factors that affected calf health status between birth and 6 months of age. A convenience sample of approximately 3300 female Holstein calves born in 1991 on two large Florida dairy farms was used for the study. Data collected on each calf at birth included farm of origin, weight, height at the pelvis, birth date, and serum total protein (a measure of colostral immunoglobulin absorption). Birth season was dichotomized into summer and winter using meteorological data collected by University of Florida Agricultural Research Stations. Health data including date of initial treatment and number of treatments were collected for the diseases diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia. All calves were followed for 6 months. Cumulative incidences of mortality and occurrence of diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia were 0.12, 0.35, 0.11, 0.24 and 0.21, respectively. Serum total protein (TP) was a significant risk factor for mortality. The association of TP and mortality was quadratic and showed a dramatic decrease in mortality as TP increased from 4.0 to 5.0 g/dl, a small improvement from 5.0 to 6.0 g/d1 and virtually no improvement in mortality rates as TP increased over 6.0 g/dl. The hazard mortality ratio was constant from birth to six months, indicating that the increased risk of mortality associated with low levels of TP was evident through six months of age. No interactions between TP, farm, season, or birth weight were found in these analyses. Serum total protein concentration was a significant risk factor for the 32 G. A. Donovan et al. /Preventive Veterinary Medicine 34 (1998) 31-46 occurrences, age of onset and severity of septicemia and pneumonia. The association between TP and septicemia was linear and an interaction with birth season was found. The association between TP and pneumonia was quadratic, and in contrast to the TP-and-septicemia relationship, the morbidity hazard ratio for pneumonia was not constant over the time measured; that is, colostral immunity protected the calf from developing pneumonia early in life, but this effect disappeared as the calf got older. Total protein was not a significant risk factor for diarrhea or omphalitis. 0 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The neonatal calf, which is born with little or no humoral immunity, is totally dependent upon absorption of colostrally-derived immunoglobulins for its early disease resistance (Tizard, 1996; Duhamel and Osburn, 1984) . A 2-to 4-fold increase in mortality in calves with failure of passive transfer (FPT) compared to those that have received adequate amounts of colostral immunoglobulins has been reported (MCEWZUI et al., 1970; Boyd, 1972; McGuire et al., 1976; Caldow et al., 1988; Robison et al., 1988) .",

Davidson et al. (198 1) found that not only was respiratory disease risk reduced and fewer treatment days required in colostrum-satisfied calves, but onset of disease was delayed by 5 to 7 days. With respect to neonatal calf diarrhea, the effects of passive immunity are less clear. Results of epidemiological and experimental studies are divided between those showing no effect (McEwan et al., 1970; Caldow et al., 1988; Harp et al., 1989) and those demonstrating a reduction in incidence and severity of diarrhea and/or a decrease in mortality attributable to enteritis (Boyd et al., 1974; Fallon et al., 1987) . These discrepancies can be explained mainly by differences in the primary causative organism involved. Diarrhea caused by Escherichia coli can be effectively controlled by feeding the neonate colostrum containing antibodies directed specifically at the enterotoxigenic form (Boyd et al., 1974; Logan et al., 1974) . Colostral antibodies are not as efficacious against enteritis caused by SaZmonella sp., viruses and protozoa-probably due to the later age at which these disease problems occur (Smith et al., 1980; Archambault et al., 1989; Harp et al., 1989) .",

It is generally accepted that calves with serum immunoglobulin Gl (IgGl) concentrations of less than 10 mg/ml have failure of passive transfer (FPT) (Gay, 1983) . Serum total protein concentration is highly correlated (r = 0.88) with immunoglobulin concentrations measured using RID . Braun and Tennant (1983) described three disease risk categories based on the calf s serum total protein values at 24-48 h. Calves were at high risk of mortality with TP < 5.0 g/dl, low risk of mortality with TP > 5.4 and at intermediate risk if TP was between 5.0 and 5.4. The objective of this study was to define the associations between passive immune status (as determined by serum total protein) and morbidity and mortality during the first six months of life. A secondary objective was to provide descriptive epidemiologic data of morbidity and mortality in a large population of dairy calves.",

Remarkably, very few scientific studies have been able to quantify any protection afforded by passive transfer or dipping of the navel in a disinfectant solution Waltner-Toews et al., 1986) . Two factors could play a role in these negative findings. First, the health management practices on these farms are such that all navels were evaluated at 2 to 4 days of age and if the navel was swollen or had an abnormal discharge, antibiotic therapy was initiated. The possibility for non-differential misclassification of navel infections may be quite high, thus, reducing the chances of finding an association if there was one.

However, as in the mortality model, the association between TP and the occurrence of pneumonia was a quadratic relationship that was independent of season and farm. The lack of seasonal interaction would be expected because of the delay in the onset of pneumonia to after 30 days of age; some calves born in one season would be at risk of getting diseased in another. The hazard of developing pneumonia was not constant over time; protection was strong in the young calf but had waned completely by 180 days of age. This makes biological sense in that it would be hard to expect colostral immunity to protect the calf after three of four months when factors such as overcrowding, parasitism and nutritional stress are likely much larger contributors to the occurrence of disease. However, in extensively-managed beef calves, Wittum and Perino (1995) found a strong association between FPT and feedlot morbidity due to pneumonia (OR = 3.0).

The preventive effect of colostrum with regards to mortality was quadratic in nature, implying that a much-greater improvement in calf mortality can be seen when TP is increased from 4.0 to 5.0 g/d1 than there is when TP increases from 5.5 to 6.5 g/dl. These effects on mortality last longer than previously thought as evident by a constant mortality hazard ratio up to 6 months of age.",
