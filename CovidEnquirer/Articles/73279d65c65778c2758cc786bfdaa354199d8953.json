            "text": "Over the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in international adoptions in the United States. While most adopted children will have common illnesses, others may have unique medical issues as a result of the conditions in their birth country requiring a broadened differential diagnosis. Knowledge of these issues is essential in the management of these patients. This review will predominately focus on infectious disease issues commonly seen in international adoptees but will also discuss other medical conditions and some of the psychosocial issues which may be encountered by caregivers in the emergency department. In 2002, US citizens adopted 20,099 children from more than 20 different countries, an increase from 6,472 international adoptees in 1992. 1 In addition to the increase in the number of children internationally adopted, there has also been a shift in the countries where these children originate towards countries with a low per capita income (Fig 1) and children residing primarily in institutionalized settings. These shifting demographics account not only for changes in the epidemiology of infectious diseases but also an increase in developmental and psychological issues resulting from the effects of institutionalization. Today, the majority of internationally adopted children have resided their entire lives in orphanages. The exceptions to this are children from South Korea and Guatemala, where they are primarily cared for in foster care settings. 2 There has also been a shift in recent years to a female predominance, with a larger number of children adopted from China where there is a birth parent preference of boys over girls, leaving many infant girls available for adoption. While children of all ages are available for adoption, 90% of internationally adopted children are younger than 5 years of age when they join their new families. 1 There are several unique challenges in delivering medical care to international adoptees. While all international adoptees share a common history of the loss of their birth family, there are country-specific risks that should be considered. These risks may change over time as conditions in the birth countries change or as children are adopted from a broader range of countries. Children who are available for adoption are often the most impoverished children in their countries. Maternal health issues such as malnutrition, congenital infections, and tobacco, drug, and alcohol exposure are common, and these conditions may lead to prenatal insults resulting in long term medical and developmental issues for the child. Life in the orphanage also adds additional nutritional and infectious disease risks, and a lack of stimulation may lead to developmental delays and attachment issues. It is often difficult to fully assess the risk for any given child. If past medical information is available from the child's birth country, the information may be unreliable or uninterpretable, but it is certainly important to review whatever information is available. [3] [4] [5] While adoptees routinely have a medical evaluation in their birth country just before arriving in the United States, the examination is cursory, and infectious diseases and other conditions are often overlooked. [6] [7] [8] Thus, it is recommended that all international adoptees be evaluated within the first two weeks of arrival in the United States, or immediately if there is an acute illness. 3,6-8 Parents may seek care for their children in the emergency department (ED) for emergencies or for less severe conditions because as new parents they are unaware of the severity of their child's illness or because they have not yet found a primary care provider for their child.",

            "text": "International adoptees often face challenges that can affect their transition to their new families. Some of these include language barriers, cultural differences, and environmental changes, which may result in disturbances in sleeping, eating, and overall behavior. Many adoptees will be malnourished and developmentally delayed. [9] [10] [11] [12] In addition, life in institutionalized settings with limited caregiver involvement can result in self-stimulatory behaviors and altered responses to new sensory stimuli. Without knowledge of these issues, the initial presentation of some children can cause concern for the caregiver unfamiliar with internationally adopted children who have just arrived to the United States. While the transition of living in an orphanage to joining a loving family is often a difficult transition for internationally adopted children, it is also important to realize that the parents' transition is often just as difficult. Parents are often physically and emotionally exhausted and frequently lack confidence in their role as new parents. Awareness of these issues can provide insight into the psychological state of the family so that the best care can be provided. Because parents often have little command of their child's birth language, it is often difficult to obtain information about the child's symptoms. Utilizing interpreter services, especially for children two years and older, can be extremely helpful. ",

Because of the high prevalence of intestinal parasites and tuberculosis in resource-poor countries and the lack of perinatal screening for hepatitis B, syphilis, and HIV, international adoptees are at increased risk for these infections. 7 The importance of an initial screening evaluation was demonstrated in a study where 67% of internationally adopted children were diagnosed with hepatitis B, intestinal pathogens, or tuberculosis. 13 Most of these infections were only identified by doing these screening tests since infections with tuberculosis, hepatitis B, syphilis, and intestinal parasites are often asymptomatic. The American Academy of Pediatric's Committee on Infectious Diseases recommends that international adoptees be screened for these infections shortly after arrival to the United States (Table 1) . 7 In addition, specialists in the field have recommended other tests be done as well. 3, 6, [13] [14] [15] [16] Some children may not have had their initial evaluation, thus the ED physician should determine whether testing has been done, and if not, these screening tests should be completed or recommended to the family. Other testing may be indi-cated based on the child's symptoms and clinical findings as well as the child's country of origin and other risk factors identified from their past medical history.",

In addition, for tuberculosis prevention, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is commonly used across the world in countries where tuberculosis is endemic. Other routine vaccines recommended in the US immunization schedule, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal, varicella, mumps, and rubella, may not be available or routinely administered in the birth countries of international adoptees. Documentation of immunizations may not always be available, 24 and similarly, children who have had varicella or measles may not have any documentation of these diseases. Several studies have been done to determine if documented birth country immunizations of internationally adopted children could be verified through serologic testing. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] The results of these studies are not in agreement, with some showing poor protection and others showing good protection. Differences in study design and laboratory methods likely account for the different results. With the lack of consensus in this matter, there are currently two acceptable approaches recommended to assure that internationally adopted children are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. 7,29 The first approach is to reinitiate all immunizations regardless of documentation; the second approach is to use serologic testing to determine which immunizations are needed, with or without documentation of immunization. Because antibody testing for one vaccine may not be predictive for others, a combination of reimmunization and antibody testing could be utilized. Serologic testing is available for most vaccine antigens ( Table  2) . Testing for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella should only be done in children older than 12 months of age because of the possible presence of maternal antibody. For varicella vaccine, serologic testing is likely to be cost-effecting in school-aged children 30 ; however, cost-effectiveness analyses of serotesting for other vaccines has not been reported to date.",

An adherent membrane over the tonsils, pharynx, or nose can be seen on physical examination. Symptoms may progress to diffuse cervical lymphadenitis or neck swelling with complications of upper airway obstruction, toxic myocarditis, and peripheral neuropathies. The diagnosis is made by obtaining cultures from the nose, throat, or mucous membrane lesions. The laboratory should be noti- fied if there is a suspicion of diphtheria since special media and precautions are required. 7 If the diagnosis is strongly suspected, local public health officials should be notified. Because infection can lead to rapid clinical deterioration, any clinical diagnosis or suspicion warrants administration of a single dose of equine antitoxin. In addition, erythromycin or penicillin should be given for a 14-day course. 7",

Thus, if tetanus protection has not been verified serologically and the child has a tetanusprone wound, the child should be given human tetanus immune globulin and a tetanus toxoid vaccine (DTaP for children less than 7 years of age or Td for children 7 years or older). 7",

The paroxysmal stage follows with sudden recurrent coughing episodes interspersed with inspiratory whoops. The diagnosis is made by obtaining a specimen from the nasopharynx by aspiration or swab for culture on special medium. 7,32 A direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) can be done, but it is not as reliable as culture as there is variable sensitivity and low specificity. 7 Polymerase chain reaction assays are available and can provide rapid and sensitive results. 7 Lymphocytosis in a child with clinical symptoms of pertussis supports the diagnosis. Erythromycin estolate is the treatment of choice; however, azithromycin or clarithromycin may be as effective and may have fewer side effects with increased compli-ance. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for contacts. 7",

The classic presentation is fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, an erythematous maculopapular rash, and pathognomonic enanthemas known as Koplik spots. 7 Children may also have otitis media, bronchopneumonia, croup, diarrhea, and acute encephalitis. 7 A rare post-infectious neurologic complication of measles, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, was reported in an adoptee from Thailand 9 years after arrival in the US. 19 The initial diagnosis of measles is made on clinical grounds and is confirmed by obtaining a single IgM serum antibody test for measles. 7 Treatment is supportive, however Vitamin A supplementation is recommended for children 6 months to 2 years of age who are hospitalized with measles or its complications. 7",

In international adoptees, rates have been highest among Romanian adoptees from the early 1990s where 53% had markers of past or present hepatitis B infection and 20% of children had active infection. 21 More recent studies have consistently shown a 3% to 5% prevalence of HBV in international adoptees. 2, 5, 11, 14, 21 Adoptees are most often infected from their birth mothers and are therefore at high risk of having chronic infection. Acquisition can also occur from exposure in the orphanage or from blood products or contaminated needles. Children are commonly asymptomatic and are therefore only identified through serologic screening. Initial serologic testing should include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb). Children with HBsAb alone have evidence of HBV immunization. Those with HBsAg and HBcAb have either acute or chronic HBV infection. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B infection is made if the HBsAg persists for greater than 6 months. Children with HBsAb and HBcAb have recovered HBV infection and are not contagious and do not need further immunization. Because HBV has a long incubation period, negative serology may not reflect infection just before immigration; therefore, repeat testing 6 months after arrival to the United States is recommended. 7 If a child is found to have hepatitis B infection, it is important to assess whether there have been any exposures and whether prophylaxis is needed. In addition, plans should be made to assure all family members have been immunized. Children with chronic hepatitis B infection should be referred to and managed by a pediatric hepatologist. Therapy with interferon-alpha and lamivudine have been effective in some patients with chronic hepatitis B infection but appear to be less effective in infections acquired during early childhood. 7",

Induration of 5 mm or more is used when the patient has had close contact with an infectious case, is immunosuppressed, or has suspected disease by physical examination or a chest radiograph. 7 False-negative tests may be seen in children who are malnourished or who have active disease. False-positive TST results can occur in children with a history of receiving the BCG vaccine. However, most adoptees have received the vaccine, and yet the vast majority of children do not have a reactive TST. A recent study conducted in Peru found the TST was frequently reactive in children who had received the BCG vaccine; however, the size of the reaction was rarely greater than 5 mm. 38 A history of BCG immunization is not a contraindication to placing a TST, and a positive TST should not be attributed to the BCG vaccine. 7 If the patient has a reactive TST, a thorough examination should be done and a chest radiograph should be obtained. If disease is suspected, it is important that every attempt be made to isolate the organism so that susceptibilities can be done to guide therapy. Early morning gastric aspirates should be obtained in children with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. 7 Latent tuberculosis is treated with a nine month course of isoniazid. Children with disease should be treated with a multidrug regimen in consultation with an infectious disease specialist taking into consideration the most recent resistant patterns from the child's country of origin. 7, 15 It is not uncommon for children immunized with the BCG vaccine to develop a localized granulomatous abscess or suppurative lymphadenitis in a lymph node adjacent to the site of immunization. The granuloma is typically located on the upper arm and may or may not be draining. Culture of the drainage yields Mycobacterium bovis, the bacteria used in the BCG vaccine. There is no consensus regarding management of localized abscesses or lymphadenitis caused by BCG. Some lesions may resolve without treatment while others will require excision or treatment with isoniazid, erythromycin, or clarithromycin. 39,40",

Treponemal tests include fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and microhemagglutination-T pallidum (MHA-TP) tests, and are used to establish the diagnosis.

Recent studies have not identified any children infected with HIV. 2, 5, 11, 14, 21 In the early 1990s, the concern about HIV infection in adoptees was greater because many children were adopted from Romanian orphanages where the HIV incidence was high. 41, 42 While estimates of HIV infection in international adoptees during this era is not available, there were case reports of 2 Romanian adoptees with HIV in-fection. 43 Recent case series only report the prevalence of false-positive HIV ELISA serology with negative confirmatory testing. 2, 14 Despite the low prevalence of HIV in international adoptees, recommendations are to screen all children for HIV. Most children have documentation of negative HIV testing from their country of origin, but results should not be considered conclusive as errors in testing and reporting can occur and initial negative serology does not reflect infection acquired just before testing. Screening recommendations include serologic testing for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 shortly after arrival to the United States with consideration for repeat testing 6 months later with antibody-based assays. 7",

While intestinal parasites are felt to be more prevalent than bacterial infections or viral infections, the latter have not been systematically examined in adoptees. The prevalence of intestinal parasites has varied from 9% to 51%, depending on age and country of origin, with an increased risk in older children and children originating from countries other than Korea. 2, 5, 11, 14, 21 Giardia lamblia is the most commonly identified pathogen in all series, with as many as 19% of children infected. 2 The highest rates of Giardia were in children from Eastern Europe (Bulgaria 67%; Romania 50%; Moldova 36%) with lower rates in Russia (25%) and China (15%). Other protozoal infections include Blastocystis hominis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Entamoeba histolytica. 2, 11, 14, 21 Helminth infections are seen less often but include Hymenolepis species (tapeworm) and Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura (roundworms). 2, 11, 14, 21, 44 A number of nonpathogenic parasites may also be identified through ova and parasite testing 2, 14, 45 (Table 3) . While these pathogens do not require treatment, they should prompt further evaluation for pathogenic parasites. Children with intestinal parasites may be asymptomatic or have symptoms ranging from acute watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, or protracted intermittent diarrhea with foul-smelling stools, flatulence, abdominal distention, and anorexia. Anorexia and malabsorption can lead to weight loss, failure to thrive, and anemia. Asymptomatic infections are common and may not be identified until the adoptee has lived in the United States for some time. 33 The diagnosis of most intestinal parasites is done by examination of stool preserved in 5% to 10% formalin and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or sodiumacetate formalin for ova and parasite testing. Ob-taining three stool specimens 2 to 3 days apart increases the sensitivity for identification of parasites. 7, 15 One stool specimen should also be sent for G lamblia and C parvum antigen testing. 7 Certain parasites such as Cyclospora species and Strongyloides stercoralis may not be detected by standard ova and parasite screening, and special testing for these parasites should be considered in patients with recurrent or refractory diarrhea. 7 If a parasite has been identified, specific treatment for that parasite should be initiated. Eradication does not always occur, thus repeat testing to assure the infection has cleared is recommended.",

The ED may serve as the first medical encounter for patients with this acute infection. Following standard infection control guidelines on a daily basis and being aware of which children are at risk for SARS can help identify children who may have this infection and prevent the spread of disease. Because the clinical features of SARS are indistinguishable from most febrile respiratory illnesses, the clinician will need to base their clinical suspicion of SARS on both clinical and epidemiologic data. Patients with fever and a respiratory illness as well as a history of travel to a SARSinfected area or close contact with a SARS patient meet the case definition as a probable case of SARS requiring further evaluation. If SARS is suspected, there should be a coordinated effort between the child's physician, infection control, the infectious disease physician, and the clinical laboratory to identify the cause of the child's illness as well as to assure prevention of transmission. The diagnosis is made through laboratory testing done at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool can be performed.

In addition, malaria or malabsorptive disorders may be associated with anemia. 6, 16 A complete blood count with erythrocyte indices with an electrophoresis is suggested for evaluation of international adoptees. Because G6PD deficiency is relatively common in Asian, Mediterranean, and African populations, screening for this disorder should be considered before prescribing drugs such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and isoniazid, which can cause hemolysis in children with this deficiency. 8 Anemia with eosinophilia may indicate intestinal or tissue helminthes.",

Vitamin D levels and chemistry levels are often not helpful since multivitamin supplementation given to adoptees prior to evaluation may affect the results. Most cases respond to normal diet and multivitamin supplementation. 3, 6, 52 Lead Poisoning Elevated blood lead levels have been reported in as many as 14% of international adoptees from China, 11 Cambodia, Russia, and Eastern Europe. 53 Exposure is felt to be from leaded gasoline exhaust, ceramic ware, lead-based paint, and industrial waste. 8 It is recommended that all international adoptees have a lead poisoning screening done as a part of their initial evaluation.",
