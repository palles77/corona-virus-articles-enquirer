APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases as well as in several types of cancer. Therefore, inhibitors of APN may be effective against cancer and inflammation. By virtual screening and enzymatic assays, we identified three non-competitive inhibitors (a > 1) of the porcine and human APN with K i values in the mM range. These non-peptidic compounds lack the classical zinc-binding groups (ZBG) present in most of the APN inhibitors. Molecular docking simulations suggested the novel inhibitors suppress APN activity by an alternative mechanism to Zn coordination: they interacted with residues comprising the S1 and S5 0 subsites of APN. Of note, these compounds also inhibited the porcine aminopeptidase A (pAPA) using a competitive inhibition mode. This indicated differences in the binding mode of these compounds with APN and APA. Based on sequence and structural analyses, we predicted the significance of targeting human APN residues: Ala-351, Arg-442, Ala-474, Phe-896 and Asn-900 for improving the selectivity of the identified compounds. Remarkably, the intraperitoneal injection of compounds BTB07018 and JFD00064 inhibited APN activity in rat brain, liver and kidney indicating good bio-distribution of these inhibitors in vivo. These data reinforce the idea of designing novel APN inhibitors based on lead compounds without ZBG.",

Accordingly, APN is a major target for treatment of diseases related to these physiological processes [1] . APN is the most extensively studied member of the M1-family of zinc-dependent aminopeptidases [1] . This enzyme is widely expressed on cell surfaces of tissues, such as intestinal epithelia and the nervous system [1] . APN is a type II membrane protein generally found as a homodimer in several mammalian species. Full-length human APN consists of 967 amino acids with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a large ectodomain containing two catalytic motifs highly conserved across the M1 family: the zinc-binding motif HEXXHX18E and the exopeptidase signature GXMEN [2] .",

            "text": "The general catalytic mechanism of mammalian APN is believed to be similar to that of prototypic zinc peptidase thermolysin, which involves catalytic water attacking scissile peptide bonds [3] . However, the means by which substrates gain access to the catalytic site and how products are released have been the subject of some debate for several members of the M1 family [4e6] . APN preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids, most notably alanine, off the N terminus of peptide substrates leading to their activation/inactivation in the extracellular space. Mammalian APN operates ubiquitously in peptide metabolism pathways. It plays important roles in pain sensation and mood regulation by catalyzing the metabolism of neuropeptides that process sensory information. One of these neuropeptides is enkephalin, which binds to opioid receptors and has pain-relief and mood-regulating effects [7] ; APN hydrolyses and shortens the in vivo life of enkephalin. APN is moreover involved in blood pressure regulation; it degrades the vasoconstrictive peptide angiotensin-III, causing vasodilation and lowered blood pressure [8] . An endogenous APN inhibitor, substance P, blocks both the enkephalin-dependent and angiotensin-dependent pathways [9, 10] . APN is also overexpressed on the cell surface of almost all major cancer forms and is essential for tumor angiogenesis by degrading angiogenic peptides [11] . A natural APN inhibitor, bestatin, is a substrate analog for APN and demonstrates antitumor activities [12] . However, it should be noted that these generic inhibitors often show activity against other aminopeptidase families [13] .",

These putative ligands labeled as: BTB11079, JFD00064, NRB00567 and BTB07018 are hydrophobic compounds of low molecular weight (under 625 g/mol) ( Table 1; Supplementary Information Table 1 ). However, compound NRB00567 was excluded from all the assays based on the PAINS-Remover filter analysis, due to the presence of the quinone structural moieties in its scaffold. The 2D structure of JFD00064 and BTB07018 contains hydrogen bond acceptor groups. Interestingly, the analysis of the 2D structure of BTB07018 showed two hydrogen bond donor groups (Supplementary Information Table 1 and Supplementary Information Fig. 1) .",

To determine the strength and type of inhibition of the compounds against porcine aminopeptidase activity, the Michaelis-Menten model and the Lineweaver-Burk approximation were used (Fig. 2 AeD, A 0 -D 0 , respectively). The details of the fitting to both mathematic models are shown in Supplementary Information Table 3 . The pattern of straight lines in the double-reciprocal plots represented the signature for a typical non-competitive inhibition profile for all the inhibitors [26, 27] ; this implies that the inhibitors display binding affinity for both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate binary complex, and suggests that they do not compete with the substrate for binding to the free enzyme. Remarkably, the lines intersect above the x and y axes, at negatives values of 1/[S] and positive values of 1/v, indicating that all the inhibitors decrease the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (signature a > 1) (Fig. 2 A 0 -D 0 ) [26, 27] . This mode of inhibition is also referred to as mixed inhibition, based on the effect of increasing inhibitor concentration on both V max and K M values. Similar inhibition profiles were obtained for the interaction of the compounds with the hAPN (data not shown). The secondary plots used for K i and aK i determination are shown in Supplementary   Information Fig. 4 Table 3 ). Similar K i values vs hAPN were also observed ( Table 1) .",

In this study, we identified APN inhibitors which chemical structures did not contain the classical ZBG. To figure out how these molecules inhibit human and porcine neutral aminopeptidases, we analyzed the binding mode of the inhibitors to the human APN obtained by molecular docking simulations. We observed a remarkable prevalence of hydrophobic interactions with aliphatic (Ala-351 and Ala-353), aromatic (Phe-472, Tyr-891, and Phe-896) and polar (Gln-211 and Gln-213) residues (Fig. 3) . The compounds did not coordinate the zinc ion in the active site, and established few hydrophobic interactions with the metal coordinating residues His388, His392, and Glu411 (Fig. 3) . We predicted that all the inhibitors bind to Tyr477, a residue involved in the stabilization of the transition state oxyanion form, through hydrophobic interactions, and that compounds BTB11079 and BTB07018 establish hydrophobic interactions with Glu389, a key residue for polarizing the water molecule that attacks the scissile peptide bond. Contrary to bestatin [2] , we predicted interactions of the identified inhibitors with residues: Ser-415, Glu-418, Tyr-419, Asn-438, Asp-439 Arg-442, Asp-473, Ala-474, Asn-900, and Gln-903 (Fig. 3) .

APN expression is dysregulated in inflammatory diseases as well as in solid and hematologic tumors [12] . Therefore, inhibitors of APN may be effective against cancer and inflammation [12, 31, 32] . Chelating zinc ions through a ZBG is the most common mode of action of neutral aminopeptidase inhibitors [13,28e30,33e38] . Most of these inhibitors display a competitive inhibition mode of action. Here, we identified three non-competitive inhibitors (a > 1) of human and porcine neutral aminopeptidases; these ligands do not contain a ZBG in their 3D structure. The K i values of these new compounds were similar to those reported for natural APN inhibitors [12, 29] . Molecular docking simulations predicted that the inhibitors bind to a site distinct from that occupied by the substrate in the human APN active site (Fig. 3) . This is consistent with the non-competitive inhibition profile obtained in the kinetic assays. The analysis of hAPN:Inhibitor complexes showed that interactions span from S1 to S5 0 subsites, without Zn ion coordination. This uncommon mechanism of inhibition is similar to that described for compound MMV666023, an inhibitor of the neutral M1 aminopeptidase of Plasmodium falciparum [39] . The newly identified inhibitors share with compound MMV666023 a high hydrophobicity and a lack of typical ZBG [39] . The lack of ZBG may diminish inhibitor interactions with other metalloenzymes, and may improve pharmacokinetics and oral Color codes: ligand atoms: carbon in magenta, oxygen in red, sulfur in yellow, and nitrogen in blue; atoms of the protein contact residues: carbon (blue light), oxygen (red), nitrogen (blue), and the Zn atom (gray). The hydrogen bonds interactions are represented as red dotted lines and the Zn coordination as gray dotted lines. For clarity, we didn't represent the van der Waals interactions between ligands and protein contact residues. Uniprot codes: human APN (AMPN_HUMAN); they included APN from pig (AMPN_PIG), rat (AMPN_RAT) and bovine (AMPN_BOVINE) species. We also included in our analysis the human glutamyl (AMPE_Human) and endoplasmic reticulum (ERAP1_HUMAN) aminopeptidases. The specific residues of neutral aminopeptidases targeted by the inhibitors are highlighted by red rectangles.",

            "text": "To check the selectivity of the inhibitor we tested its activity over porcine APA. APN and APA form the same interactions with the main chain of the N-terminal residue (P1 residue) of their ligands, suggesting that the two enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism despite their modest sequence similarity [2, 40] . However, the S1 pocket that accommodates the P1 side chain of ligands differs markedly between APN and APA, consistent with the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. Residues Phe-896 and Ala-351 of the S1 pocket of APN favor the accommodation of bulky hydrophobic side chains [2] . Conversely, the S1 pocket of APA is well suited to accommodate the side chains of acidic residues; the carboxylate side chain of bound glutamate forms a strong salt bridge with Arg-887 and a hydrogen bond with Thr-356. These energetically favorable interactions are consistent with high APA activity on substrates with a P1 glutamate [40] . Therefore, we did not expect selectivity of the identified inhibitors for APN over APA because we predicted these ligands target several conserved residues. Preliminary kinetics experiments confirmed that the new compounds also inhibited pAPA with IC 50 values similar to those detected for pAPN. However, BTB11079, JFD00064, and BTB07018 displayed a competitive inhibition mode that differed from that vs pAPN. This may result from an accommodation of the inhibitors at the active site of pAPA that differs from the binding mode predicted for APN. Additional experiments should clarify the selectivity of the newly identified inhibitors against other aminopeptidases of the M1 family, and may identify dual inhibitions of biomedical relevance [13] . Based on the sequence and structural analyses, we predicted that targeting the APN residues Ala-351, Arg-442, Ala-474, Phe-896 and Asn-900 might be useful for improving the selectivity of the identified inhibitors.",

This finding is relevant due to the implication of APN in physio-and patho-physiological processes in these tissues [41e46] . Many hydrophobic drugs reversibly bind to Site 1 of human serum albumin (HSA), an association that improves the pharmacokinetics properties of therapeutic compounds [47] . Since mammalian serum albumins share more than 70% of sequence identity and have similar functions [48] , the effective delivery of JFD00064 and BTB07018 to rat tissues may have been facilitated by their reversible binding to rat serum albumin hydrophobic sites. Moreover, HSA delivery systems have been extensively studied for treating brain disease since HSA can pass through the blood brain barrier [48] ; interestingly, compounds JFD00064 and BTB07018 inhibited APN activity in the brain of rats, indicating these molecules crossed the blood-brain barrier.

In vivo effect of inhibitors on APN activity in (A) brain, (B) kidney, (C) liver, and (D) pancreas of adult male rats. Animals were inoculated with a single injection of saline (vehicle) or inhibitor (3 mg/g b.w. of BTB11079, JFD00064 or BTB07018), and sacrificed by decapitation 60 min later. Tissues were rapidly dissected, frozen on dry ice and kept at \u00c070 C until preparation of membranes for evaluation of APN activity as described in Materials and Methods. Data are mean \u00b1 SD (n \u00bc 6). ANOVA data: brain (F \u00bc 6.673, P < 0.001), kidney (F \u00bc 10.061, P < 0.001), liver (F \u00bc 5.235, P < 0.05), pancreas (F \u00bc 5.549, P < 0.001).

Remarkably, compounds BTB07018 and JFD00064 inhibited APN activity in the brain, liver and kidney of rats indicating a good bio-distribution in vivo. Compound BTB07018 seemed to be the most promising lead among the identified inhibitors due to its cLogP <4.
