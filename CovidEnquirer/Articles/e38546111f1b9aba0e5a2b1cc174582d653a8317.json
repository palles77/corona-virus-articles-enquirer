Often, they escape their natural wildlife reservoirs and infect captive or domestic animals and humans upon crossspecies transmission. While the majority of zoonotic pathogens spread limitedly among humans, occasionally some do evolve the ability to efficiently transmit [5] . These may cause devastating epidemics, if not pandemics, and may establish as novel human pathogens. Emerging infectious diseases of animals likewise have typically the ability to cross species barriers and invade new host species. In contrast, introduction of pathogens into new geographical areas and climate change play an essential role in the emergence of plant diseases, and the hybridization of plant pathogens that are not naturally sympatric is repeatedly reported to be involved in plant disease emergence events [2] . The consequences of emerging pathogens in newly infected species, be it wild or domestic, or in new geographical areas, can have dire repercussions on human welfare, for example, through the disruption of ecosystem services or from large agricultural economic losses [2, 6] . As such, emerging infectious diseases are One Health threats to the global community.",

Epidemics subsequently re-occurred in winter 2014 and 2015, with the highest reported numbers of animal outbreaks and zoonotic cases of infection during the months of January-February of each year. LPAIV H7N9, in contrast to most other avian influenza viruses, can bind to the cellular receptors used by seasonal influenza viruses [9, 10] . This ability is associated with one or two specific amino-acids in the hemagglutinin glycoprotein. Because seasonal influenza viruses and LPAIV H7N9 peak coincidentally during the winter months, they may co-infect an individual and subsequently reassort [11] . This may give rise to a transmissible variant, against which the human population has little pre-existing immunity, and may be at the origin of a new influenza pandemic. Strict monitoring and isolation measures are therefore essential to limit the risk of seasonal influenza and reassortment in individuals with zoonotic H7N9 virus infection.",

These are of paramount importance for the rapid diagnosis and containment of infected individuals. While the epidemiological situation has remained largely unchanged since the emergence of MERS, large outbreaks of nosocomial infections are worrisome. These call for the development of specific intervention strategies, should the virus become efficiently transmissible among humans. Prevention at the source, for example through the vaccination of dromedary camels against MERS-CoV, is essential to limit cross-species transmission of the virus from animals to humans. However, the development of specific intervention strategies to be rapidly deployed in humans is urgently needed, and should be undertaken ahead of a potential change in the ability of MERS-CoV to transmit among humans. This may necessitate profound changes in the interactions between the public and private sectors for the development of new medicines, as was recently learned upon emergence of the Ebola virus [26] .",

Imported cases of Ebola virus infection were reported in other African countries, as well as in Europe and North America. The massive epidemic covered a period of about a year, yet cases of infection continue to be reported in Guinea in a staggering epidemic tail (Fig. 5) . It remains unsure whether new epidemic flares will occur. Early Ebola virus outbreaks proved to be largely self-limiting. The devastating nature of the infection resulted in the rapid implementation of precautionary measures at the local level, thereby interrupting chains of human-to-human transmission after initial zoonotic events [29] . The reasons why this apparently failed to control the recent Ebola epidemic are unclear. However, its emergence in more uniformly and densely inhabited West African regions, poverty, larger scale movement and travel, as well as distrusting societal and behavioral responses to public health measures, are likely to have contributed to the escape of the virus into wider geographical areas, and to its associated exponential growth phase [30] . No specific medical interventions, including the use of antiviral drugs, antibodies or vaccines, were available at the time of the crisis, in spite of promising data indicating avenues for their development. One of the reasons behind the absence of specific medical interventions is related to \"the industry paradox\" based on a generally perceived absence of return on investment [26] .
