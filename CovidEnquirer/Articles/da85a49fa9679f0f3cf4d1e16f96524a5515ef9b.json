            "text": "Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus responsible for mild to severe enteritis in dogs (Tennant et al., 1991) . Currently, two CCoV genotypes are known, namely CCoV type I (CCoV-I) and CCoV type II (CCoV-II), the latter being classified into two subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, including classical and transmissible gastroenteritis virus-like CCoVs (Decaro et al., 2009 (Decaro et al., , 2010b . A novel hypervirulent CCoV-IIa biotype has been recently identified (strain CB/05) which is responsible for a severe, often lethal, systemic disease characterized by an unusual spreading to several internal organs both under natural and experimental conditions (Buonavoglia et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2007 ). An additional finding observed in dogs infected with this pantropic biotype is the lymphopenia associated with the detection of virus in several lymphoid organs . Milder clinical signs, including moderate lymphopenia, were also observed in pups recovered from a recent infection caused by an enterotropic strain on CCoV and subsequently infected with strain CB/05, thus showing the absence of a full cross-protection of enteric CCoV against the pantropic variant (Decaro et al., 2010a) . These preliminary studies were aimed at evaluating the clinical signs and pathology induced by the pantropic variant, but did not investigate the specific lymphocyte subsets altered during the lymphopenia. The study of the effect of this hypervirulent CCoV biotype on immune cells would be crucial to understand the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, in the present study, circulating monocytes and lymphocyte populations (CD4 + , CD8 + and CD21 + ) were analyzed by flow cytometry in dogs infected experimentally with strain CB/05. In particular, T lymphocyte subsets, B lymphocytes and monocytes were monitored early after the infection (3-5 days) and at later time points (until day 60).",

The infection was performed at the isolation unit of the Animal Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Bari, according to the animal health and well-being regulations. The study was authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health (no. 159/2006-C) and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Bari. Dogs were provided water ad libitum and fed twice daily throughout the study. For the experimental infection, 10 dogs received 3 ml of stock viral suspension of CB/05 virus (2 ml orally and 1 ml intranasally) and were observed for a period of 5 (n = 10), 24 (n = 4) or 60 (n = 2) days. To assess the presence and the distribution in internal organs of strain CB/05 at different time points, 6 infected dogs were randomly selected and euthanized at day 5 p.i. and other 2 dogs at day 24 p.i. Euthanasia was achieved by intravenous administration of 10 mg/Kg body weight of Zoletil 100 (Virbac S.r.l., Italy) followed by 0.5 ml/Kg body weight of Tanax (Intervet Italia, Italy). The two remaining pups were kept alive until day 60 p.i. Clinical signs of CCoV infection, serum antibodies against CCoV and viral shedding were monitored as previously described (Decaro et al., , 2010a . Three control dogs were not infected and received oronasally (2 ml orally and 1 ml intranasally) 3 ml of supernatants from uninfected A-72 cells (same number of passages as the A-72 cells used to propagate the stock virus).

For kinetics studies, blood samples were also collected from dogs not subjected to euthanasia at later time points as indicated in the figures. Blood samples were labelled with the following monoclonal antibodies from AbD Serotec (Oxford, UK): anti-dog CD3-PE (clone CA 17.2A12 for T lymphocytes), anti-dog CD4-FITC (clone YKIX302.9 for Thelper and neutrophils), anti-dog CD8-FITC (clone YCATE55.9 for T cytotoxic/suppressor), anti-dog CD21-PE (clone CA2.1D6, B cells), anti-human CD-14-PE (clone TUK4, monocytes). Since the CD4 molecule is expressed also on neutrophils in dogs, the CD4 + T cells were studied by double labelling the blood cells with the anti-CD3 and the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (i.e., CD3 + CD4 + cells). To remove contaminating erythrocytes a lysing solution was employed (Versa-Lyse, Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). The cell suspensions were then analyzed using the Epics XL flowcytometer (Beckman Coulter). Before the acquisition, the optical path was adjusted by testing with the optics calibrator Flow Check (Beckman Coulter). Data acquisition and analysis was performed with the Elite workstation. A count cycle contained 10,000 cells. The three major cell populations (i.e., granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes) were identified by means of proper gating and compensation in a forward-versus side-scatter dot plot and then, by using fluorescence signals. To determine the absolute numbers of cell populations (i.e, number of cells/l), the internal standard fluorescence beads (Flow-Count, Beckman Coulter) were used.",

As shown in Fig. 1A , CD14 + cells increased significantly by day 3 and augmented even further (although with a greater level of variability) by day 5 p.i. As expected, lymphocytes were significantly reduced by day 3 (average reduction 44%, range 11-60%) and remained at this level by day 5 p.i. (average reduction 45%, range 20-71%). The CD4 + and CD8 + T cell absolute counts were also quantified in the infected dogs and Fig. 1B shows that the CD4 + T cell population was significantly reduced by day 3 (average reduction 63%, range 52-73%) and remained low at day 5. A similar trend was observed for the CD8 + T cells; in particular, they dropped to approximately 50% of their initial counts on day 3 (range 12-61%) and remained low at day 5 p.i. (Fig. 1C ). The B lymphocytes (i.e., CD21 + ) showed a 36% reduction by day 3 p.i. (range 32-62%) followed by a rapid recovery by day 5 (Fig. 1D) .",

When compared to baseline levels, the amount of serum IgG or IgM did not change, in any dog, at any time point after the infection (data not shown). Starting from day 3 post-infection (p.i.) all infected pups displayed clinical signs of depression, diarrhoea and fever (39.5-39.9 \u2022 C), that were slightly milder than those described in previous experimental infections . Six randomly selected dogs were euthanized at day 5 p.i. and necropsy revealed the presence of enteritis (6 dogs out of 6 euthanized), enlargement of spleen (5/6), and mesenteric lymph nodes (6/6), infarctious areas in the renal cortex (3/6) and patchy areas of consolidation in the apical lobes of lungs (2/6). Histological examination of duodenum at day 5 p.i. revealed a diffuse epithelial damage and several lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrating the lamina propria (Fig. 3A ). In addition, sections of mesenteric lymph nodes showed a severe lymphoid depletion (day 5 p.i.; Fig. 3B ). Two infected pups were euthanized at day 24 p.i. while the remaining two infected dogs were monitored until day 60 p.i.; these four dogs displayed similar clinical signs (fever, loss of appetite, depression and diarrhoea) that persisted until days 10-12 p.i. Post-mortem findings in pups euthanized at day 24 p.i. consisted only in enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes. All uninfected pups remained healthy throughout the study and no gross lesions were evident in control dogs euthanized at day 5 p.i. (n = 1) or day 24 p.i. (n = 1).",

The direct involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of CB/05 infection was suggested by the ability to cause lymphopenia (Decaro et al., 2007 (Decaro et al., , 2010a . In the present study, a transient reduction in the number of all peripheral lymphocyte subsets including CD4 + , CD8 + , B cells and an increment of circulating CD14 + monocytes were observed at the acute stage of the CB/05 infection.

Studies in humans have also shown that immature B and T cells are CD13 positive but become negative upon maturation; thus, lymphocytes of peripheral blood, spleen or tonsils are CD13 negative (Riemann et al., 1999; Drexler, 1987; Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 1994; Spit et al., 1995) .

            "text": "A reduced production of mature lymphocytes by a primary lymphoid organ such as the thymus cannot be excluded since high levels of CB/05 RNA copies were found in this lymphoid organ (Decaro et al., 2010a) . In this regard, the thymus is a target organ in several infectious diseases (Savino, 2006) and many viruses (including coronaviruses), protozoa, and fungi can invade/infect the thymus interfering with the thymocyte differentiation process. It is clear that both endogenous and infectious agent-derived moieties can determine apoptosis of lymphocytes. Among the former, TNF-alpha is one of the molecules leading to apoptosis of uninfected lymphocytes in the thymus (Savino, 2006) ; it is remarkable that the excessive production of TNF-alpha by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-activated lymphocytes (Dean et al., 2003) was shown to be responsible for the apoptosis of lymphocytes in cats with FIP and TNF-alpha positively correlated with lymphopenia in HIV infection (Maury and L\u0203hdevirta, 1990) . Along these lines, another coronavirus, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59, was shown to induce thymic atrophy not from a generalized lytic infection of T lymphocytes but rather from apoptosis of immature double-positive T cells caused by infection of a small proportion of thymus epithelial cells or from dysregulated secretion of cytokines (Godfraind et al., 1995) . It would be interesting to determine whether the CD13/APN receptor is expressed on immature lymphocytes also in dogs thus rendering this thymic cell population susceptible to CB/05 infection and to determine whether the secretion of TNF-alpha contributes to the lymphopenia observed in dogs infected with CB/05.",

            "text": "Depletion of circulating CD4 + T cells, although transient, may affect humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity thus compromising the ability to generate or maintain an effective immune response. Indeed, the CD4 + T cells play a central role in immune protection (Zhu and Paul, 2008; Bluestone et al., 2009) . In humans and mice, several subpopulations of CD4 + /Th cells (e.g., Th1, Th2, Th9, Th22, Th17) and CD4 + Treg have been described and they provide support for a plethora of immune responses. Although extensive studies have not been systematically conducted in other animal species, it is clear that subpopulations of CD4 + T cells supportive of diverse immune responses exist in species other than humans and mice. Thus, it is conceivable that a prolonged depletion of CD4 + T cells may alter the immune performance of infected pups. For instance, a decline in antibody responses may be indicative of a loss of T cell help. The antibody response (also the serum neutralization activity) against CCoV is detectable 7 days following CB/05 infection in dogs (Decaro et al., , 2010a and reaches a peak 14-21 days p.i. when the CD4 + T cells are still massively depleted. In addition, when CCoV seropositive dogs were infected with the hypervirulent CB/05 strain, a boost of the serum IgG against CCoV (as well as a boost of seroneutralization titers) was observed (Decaro et al., 2010a) . In the present study, dogs infected with CB/05 seroconverted (with antibody titers comparable to those observed in previous experimental infections); in addition, the total amount of serum IgG and IgM from the same dogs infected with CB/05 was not altered through day 21 p.i. Collectively the data suggest that, in dogs surviving the CB/05 infection, the circulating CD4 + T cell pool although reduced, is sufficient to provide a CCoV-specific T cell-help to support/maintain antibody responses. It would be interesting to determine whether the antibody response to specific antigens (i.e., vaccines) is affected by the depletion of CD4 + T cells and if cell-mediated immunity (either against CCoV or other infectious agents/vaccines) is altered as it occurs in several other viral infections (Kuroda, 2010; de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005; McChesney et al., 1988) . These are important issues to address since routine vaccinations are usually carried out in pups at the age of 40-60 days, when CCoV infection is frequently observed.",

However, a potential exposure to opportunistic infections in pups infected with strain CB/05 cannot be excluded. It is noteworthy that the lowest numbers of CD4 + T cells were found at day 3-5 p.i. when the peak of monocytosis was observed. Thus, it could be hypothesized that a certain level of immune functionality could be maintained by a compensatory role played by the innate immune system (i.e, monocyte/macrophages) as it occurs in HIV infection (Kuroda, 2010) . Regarding the mechanisms responsible for the monocytosis, it could be suggested that the production of monocyte growth factors may account for the observed monocytosis in CB/05-infected dogs (Hopper et al., 1989; McKenzie et al., 1986; Maul et al., 1985; Liu et al., 2002; Tsukahara et al., 1992; Auwaerter et al., 1999; Goto et al., 2003) .",
