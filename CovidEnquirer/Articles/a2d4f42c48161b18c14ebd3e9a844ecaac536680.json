This antibiotic, currently used in the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infection, especially in Staphylococcal infections, has already showed efficacy against various viruses such as Ebola, influenza virus, flavivirus, hepatitis C virus, HIV virus and on coronavirus such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [8, 9] . A patent was filed for the treatment of infection caused by MERS-CoV in 2016 [10] . According to Zhou and colleagues, in coronaviruses, teicoplanin acts on the early step of the viral life cycle by inhibiting the low pH cleavage of the viral spike protein by cathepsin L in the late endosomes thereby preventing the release of genomic viral RNA and the continuation of virus replication cycle. A recent study by the same authors showed that this activity was conserved on SARS-Cov-2 (the target sequence that serve as cleavage site for cathepsin L is conserved among SARS-CoV spike protein) [7] . The concentration of teicoplanin required to inhibit 50% of viruses (IC 50 ) in vitro was 1.66 \u00b5M, which is much lower than the concentration reached in human blood (8.78 \u00b5M for a daily dose of 400 mg) [7] . These preliminary results need to be confirmed now by a randomized clinical trial.",
