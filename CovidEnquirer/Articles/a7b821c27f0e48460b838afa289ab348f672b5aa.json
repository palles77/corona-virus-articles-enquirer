According to Saaty, the geometric mean should be used when aggregating people's opinions (1): \"Two important issues in group decision making are: how to aggregate individual judgements in a group into a single representative judgement for the entire group and how to construct a group choice from individual choices. The reciprocal property plays an important role in combining the judgements of several individuals to obtain a single judgement for the group. Judgements must be combined so that the reciprocal of the synthesized judgements is equal to the syntheses of the reciprocals of these judgements. It has been proved that the geometric mean, not the frequently used arithmetic mean, is the only way to do that.\"",
