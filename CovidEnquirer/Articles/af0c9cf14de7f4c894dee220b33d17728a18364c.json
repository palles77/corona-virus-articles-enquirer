The development and optimization of three quantitative reverse transcription real time polymerase chain reactions (RT Real Time Qt-PCRs) and an indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) for the detection and quantitation of HPIV-1, -2 and -3 in clinical samples are described. Efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, inter-and intra-assay variability and turnaround time of the two methods were compared. These assays have been validated on 131 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Based on the results obtained, the molecular methods represent a valid and rapid tool for clinical management and should be included in diagnostic panels aimed to evaluate suspected respiratory tract infections.",

One-hundred thirty-one bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, thawed and liquefied with 1:1 N-acetylcisteine, obtained from 118 patients (male/female, 73/45; median age 51.63 \u00b1 16.12) from different clinical settings were examined. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients or the nearest relatives and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital San Giovanni Battista of Turin. Human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma (Hep-2) cells and African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells were used for primary viral isolation and propagation. Cell lines were obtained from the Zooprofilattic Institute of Lombardy and Emilia Romagna (BS TCL 23 and BS CL 86, respectively). Hep-2 and Vero cells were maintained at 37 \u2022 C and 5% CO 2 with supplemented MEM (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) containing 1% filtered glutamine, 0.15% antibiotic agent (PenStrep, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 0.2% antimycotic agent (Fungizone, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sermoneta, Italy) , and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA Laboratories GmbH). Infection was carried out at 50-60% confluence. Each infected flake (T25, Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Milano, Italy) was inoculated with a solution containing 20 l of each viral stock and 1.2 ml of MEM with 2% FCS. The medium for HPIV-1 infection contained no FCS and was supplemented with 1 g/ml of trypsin (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The flakes which were not inoculated with virus were used as controls. Cells were maintained for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C and 5% CO 2 to assist viral adsorption. Subsequently, the inoculum was removed and MEM with 2% FCS was added. The cell monolayers were observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). For virus recovering, the cellular media were centrifuged for 7 min at 210 \u00d7 g and the supernatants were kept on ice. The cell monolayers were scraped and a thermal treatment was performed to extract viral particles from cells consisting in rapid freezing on liquid nitrogen followed by defrosting for 5 m at 37 \u2022 C for three times. The recovered viral particles were stored at \u221280 \u2022 C. Ninety six-well plates at 50-60% confluence Hep-2 and Vero were inoculated with 100 l of 10-fold diluted virus or medium (i.e. negative control) for TCID 50 assay. The plates were observed daily for CPE. For evaluating IFA sensitivity, 10-fold dilutions (ranging from 10 2 to 10 \u22122 TCID 50 /200 l) of titrated virus were obtained and different variables, such as days of incubation (2-4 days) and primary monoclonal antibody dilutions (MAb; 1:40-1:80-1:160 in albumin supplemented with PBS 1%), were examined. Two hundred microliters of TCID 50 dilution were inoculated into shell vials at 50-60% confluence. The inoculum adsorption was enhanced by centrifugation at 210 \u00d7 g for 45 min. One millilitre of supplemented medium was added and the shell vials were kept in a thermostat. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 1 ml of acetone-methanol (2:1) for 10 min. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with a generic anti-HPIVs MAb (11-040 LOT M1601-Z; Argene, Verniolle, France) for 30 m at 37 \u2022 C and then with goat anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody (51-010 LOT N0310; Argene), as secondary antibody, for 30 m at 37 \u2022 C. The slides were washed and read immediately using a fluorescence microscope. The presence of bright green fluores-cence within intact cells was considered positive. The slides with too few intact cells were considered inadequate for examination.",

There was no difference between 1:40 and 1:80 MAb dilutions in terms of fluorescence intensity, while a decrement using 1:160 dilution was evident (data not shown). On day 4, HPIV-2-IFA sensitivity on Vero and Hep-2 cells was 10 \u22122 TCID 50 and 10 \u22121 TCID 50 , respectively (Fig. 1B) . A granular cytoplasmic fluorescence in infected cellular foci with a \"spread\" infection pattern at lower TCID 50 (e.g. 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22122 ) was observed; while at higher TCID 50 (e.g. 10 2 to 10 1 ), the fluorescence involved the nucleus. With Vero cells, the stain intensity resulted dependent on MAb dilution and reduced constantly with the increase of MAb dilution from 1:40 to 1:160; while no significant difference was observed on Hep-2 cells. On day 4, HPIV-3-IFA sensitivity on Vero and Hep-2 cells was 10 \u22121 TCID 50 and 10 1 TCID 50 , respectively (Fig. 1C) . A lower intensity of fluorescence was seen with high MAb dilutions, such as 1:80 and 1:160, in comparison to 1:40. Since Hep-2 cells had a very low sensitivity on day 4 post-infection, cell culture was prolonged until day 7; however, this resulted in only 1-log increment of sensitivity. A widespread and homogeneous cytoplasmic fluorescence pattern in both cellular models at lower TCID 50 (e.g. 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22122 ) was observed; while at higher TCID 50 (e.g. 10 2 to 10 1 ), syncytial formation was seen. Interestingly, HPIV-3 infection pattern was \"all or nothing\", as the first dilution higher than that of sensitivity threshold (spread staining) appeared completely negative. In Table 1 the reproducibility and sensitivity (i.e. the lowest TCID 50 concentration detectable at a frequency of 100%) of IFA are reported.",

Different IFA conditions were evaluated, such as cellular models, days post-infection, and MAb concentrations. According to the features of the replication cycle of HPIV (Vainionpaa and Hyypia, 1994) , a cytoplasmic staining of infected cells was observed, although it became nuclear (HPIV-2 infection) or syncytial (HPIV-3 infection) on day 3-4 post-infection. The two cellular models showed different susceptibility to HPIVs infection. In the case of HPIV-1, Hep-2 had a sensitivity of 10 \u22122 TCID 50 on day 3 post-infection using a MAb concentration of 1:80 (similar to that obtained by others (Aguilar et al., 2000) on NCI-H292 cells), while TCID 50 calculation on Vero cells was not attained because of their inefficient growth in the presence of trypsin, necessary for attachment of HPIV-1. Vero cells were more suitable for detection of HPIV-2 and -3. HPIV-2 sensitivity was 10 \u22122 TCID 50 on day 4 post-infection using 1:40 MAb dilution versus 2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 found by Aguilar et al. (2000) . The typical \"spread\" staining reflects HPIV-2 infection strategy, in which contiguous cells are infected subsequently. HPIV-3 had a sensitivity of 10 \u22121 TCID 50 on Vero cells on day 4 post-infection using 1:40 MAb dilution versus \u223c3 \u00d7 10 1 found by Aguilar et al. (2000) . The pattern of HPIV-3 infection (i.e. \"all or nothing\") is likely to reflect the simultaneous infection of both nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. It should be note that, although the primary MAb is able to recognize simultaneously HPIV-1, -2 and -3 without differentiating the virus, but not HPIV-4a-b, as indicated by the manufacturer, the fluorescence pattern observed was specific for each virus, thus permitting discrimination by IFA in the absence of co-infections. Also the intensity differed in relation to the MAb dilution and cellular model employed: staining on Vero cells was MAb dilution-dependent, with high dilutions (1:80-1:160) resulting in unfocused and blurred fluorescence; whereas on Hep-2 cells, 1:40 or 1:80 showed a similar intensity, with a reduction at 1:160 dilution.",
