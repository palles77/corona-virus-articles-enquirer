            "text": "When the genetic sequences of different FCV isolates are compared with each other, they show a considerable amount of variability. This heterogeneity is often a feature of RNA viruses and is a reflection of the low accuracy or fidelity of the viral encoded polymerase. This leads to plasticity of the viral genome and the potential to generate variants at relatively rapid rates in comparison with organisms whose genetic material is based on DNA. Despite the observed variability of FCVs, comparative genetic analysis has failed to separate isolates of FCV into distinct clusters or genogroups. There appears to be no clear correlation between the sequence of a virus and either its year or location of isolation, or with the particular disease with which it is associated. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The genetic diversity of FCV has been used to develop typing methods based largely on sequence analysis to differentiate between isolates. These methods have been used to explore the epidemiology of FCV-related disease and the role of live vaccine virus in disease in recently vaccinated animals. [11] [12] [13] This variability of the FCV genome has important implications to the antigenicity of this virus. The sequence variability has been shown to be particularly pronounced in key regions of the capsid protein that are responsible for the antigenic structure of the virus. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that most strains of FCV can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their antigenicity. However, there is sufficient cross-reactivity between FCV strains to allow them to be grouped together in a single serotype and to allow some degree of cross-protection between the majority of strains. This has important implications in relation to vaccine design.",

This is because many early experimental studies used aerosol challenge to infect cats, rather than the more natural oronasal route of infection.

            "text": "Skin ulceration on other parts of the body may be seen but occurs rarely and is generally mild. Some of the more virulent strains of FCV may cause pneumonia with associated dyspnea, particularly in younger animals when the disease becomes much more serious. FCV has also been reported in occasional cases of abortion. 26, 27 An acute lameness and pyrexia syndrome has also been described following FCV infection; it may or may not be associated with respiratory disease. 22, 28, 29 The lameness is usually described as shifting, affecting more than one leg, and is often accompanied by pyrexia. Affected cats are often dull and anorexic. Most cases recover within 1 to 2 days, and there are no known longterm effects on the joints. It is likely that such cases of lameness and the more typical cases associated with respiratory disease are not entirely distinct clinical entities. Instead, it has been suggested that most \"limping\" strains of FCV may cause some degree of respiratory disease, and vice versa. 29 Lameness associated with FCV infection has also been seen after vaccination. [30] [31] [32] Sequence analysis of virus isolated from affected cats has shown that in most cases, the lameness appears to be caused by coincidental infection with field virus in young kittens as they lose their maternally-derived antibody. However, in some cases, virus originating from live vaccines appears to be involved. 11, 12 A potential worrying clinical development in the repertoire of FCV induced disease has recently been reported in the United States. In 1998, the first of several outbreaks of disease was described in which affected cats presented variably with facial and paw edema (50%), pyrexia (90%), upper respiratory tract infection (50%), icterus (20%), and hemorrhage from the nose and in the feces (30% to 40%). 9 Necrosis with ulceration was also seen in areas of earlier edema. The mortality rate associated with infection often reached 50%, with both kittens and adults succumbing to infection. Necropsy findings included pneumonia (80%), hepatomegaly (50%), pancreatitis (10%), and pericarditis (10%). The disease has been recreated experimentally by infection with FCV isolated from affected cats, further confirming the role of FCV in this serious disease. The variability of FCV means we should perhaps not be surprised by the occasional new and distinct manifestation of clinical disease. To date, most of these outbreaks have been relatively well controlled with strict quarantine and disinfection.",

For viral culture, results may take up to 2 weeks to confirm, particularly if the result is that no virus is isolated. Serology is generally not helpful for the diagnosis of acute FCV or FeHV infection because of widespread immunity from vaccination or earlier infection. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is also increasingly being used for the diagnosis of FeHV. [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] PCR and sequencing has also been used to distinguish between FCV isolates, where it has been particularly useful in the investigation of vaccine failures 11, 12 and in dissecting the epidemiology of the disease. 54, 55 The inherent variability of FCV strains has meant that the development of PCRs with high enough sensitivity to be used for the routine diagnosis of all FCV strains has been very problematic. Whereas some PCRs may show a high sensitivity with some strains, the sensitivity is likely to be lower with others, in some cases leading to false negative results. Recently, a real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR that targets relatively conserved regions of the virus genome has been described. 56 This method has been shown to be able to successfully amplify a broad range of FCV strains detecting 100% of 60 laboratory strains tested.",

Both viruses remain fairly widespread in the general cat population, with an increased prevalence when cats are kept together. The viruses circulate and maintain themselves in the cat population in one of three ways. Firstly, there may be direct transmission of virus from acutely infected cats. Clearly, for the virus to persist in this way, there must be a sufficient number of susceptible animals within the population and opportunities for contact between them. Secondly, because FCV (and, to a lesser extent FeHV) can remain infectious for relatively short periods outside a host, viral contamination of the environment may lead to fomite transmission. This is particularly relevant within the close confines of a cattery or hospital, where secretions may contaminate cages, feeding and cleaning utensils, or personnel. 63 Finally, for both FCV and FeHV, animals that recover from acute disease may remain infected and develop persistent infections. Despite vaccination, such carriers are common in the population and are probably the main reason why these viruses remain so widespread.",

For example, there is some evidence that preexisting FIV infection may potentiate FCV shedding either in terms of the duration of shedding, 23 or the titer of virus shed. 25 FCV carriers shed virus more-or-less continuously. Individual cats seem to vary in the quantity of virus they shed, 65 and it is likely that those animals that shed the higher amounts of virus will transmit infection most readily. In contrast, low-level shedders are probably not as infectious and may also be more difficult to detect because the level of virus shed may intermittently fall below the sensitivity of virus diagnosis.

Before vaccines were introduced in the 1970s, surveys showed that approximately 8% of household pets, 25% of cats attending cat shows, and 40% of colony cats were shedding the virus. 69 However, in recent years, approximately 20% to 25% of cats in a variety of husbandry situations still shed FCV. 60, 61, 70 In one rescue shelter, FCV prevalence was approximately 25% despite the regular use of vaccination to control clinical disease. 55 Molecular epidemiology studies showed that within this particular shelter, most isolates were distinct, unless the isolates were obtained from cats that were housed in the same pen. This suggests that the high prevalence within the rescue shelter was because of the high prevalence of FCV in cats arriving at the shelter rather than significant transmission within the shelter. In contrast, a single viral strain often seems to predominate in household colonies with a high prevalence of infection, although evolution of the individual colony isolates may occur over time. 71 Molecular studies should enable a clearer understanding of the epidemiology of FCV and the role of the carrier state in the continued high prevalence of this virus. Preexisting immunity, acquired either naturally as maternally derived antibody or artificially following parenteral vaccination, does not prevent infection with FCV. Animals may become carriers following subclinical infection with field virus, thereby maintaining infection in the population (see Figure 35 -3). There is no evidence that vaccination will cure an existing carrier state.",

Some inactivated vaccines have also been used during pregnancy in queens as a useful control measure aimed at prolonging the persistence of maternally derived antibody in kittens 90 ; however, individual data sheets should be checked for this indication. Although inactivated vaccines are classically considered less efficacious than live vaccines, modern adjuvants have led to improvements in immunogenicity. Indeed, a long duration of immunity and reasonable levels of protection in most cats has recently been shown for an adjuvanted, inactivated FCV and FeHV vaccine. 80, 81 Adjuvants may, however, cause clinical problems following vaccination in some individual cats. Both local injection site reactions and systemic reactions including pyrexia and lethargy have been observed. Most of these signs are transient, but local reactions may persist for several weeks. In recent years it has become apparent that in rare cases such reactions may progress to sarcomas. 91 Although adjuvants, particularly those based on aluminum, have been implicated in the etiology of vaccine-associated sarcomas, their precise role in the process remains unclear.",

Intranasal vaccines are particularly useful when a rapid onset of protection is required (e.g., for a cat going into a boarding cattery or in the face of an outbreak of disease). In contrast to parenteral vaccines, only a single dose of intranasal vaccine is generally required to induce immunity following primary vaccination.

These vaccines may also overcome maternally derived antibody better than parenteral vaccines, although in general their use is only licensed in kittens from 12 weeks of age.
