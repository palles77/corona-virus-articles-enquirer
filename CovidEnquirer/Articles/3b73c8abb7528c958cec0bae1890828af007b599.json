In this work we present methods to include the effects of domain growth on the evolution of spatial correlations in a continuum approximation of a lattice-based model of cell motility and proliferation. We show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different steady-state densities are predicted for an agent population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the way in which domain growth is implemented can result in the evolution of the agent density depending on the size of the domain. Continuum approximations that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture these behaviours, while those that account for spatial correlations do. These results will be of interest to researchers in developmental biology, as they suggest that the nature of domain growth can determine the characteristics of cell populations. * ross@maths.ox.ac.uk",

Individual-based models (IBMs) are able to recapitulate these spatial correlations, whereas models that employ certain mean-field approximations (MFAs), such as the logistic model [25] , and, in a spatially-extended context, the diffusion equation, cannot [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Accurate continuum models are important tools for understanding the behaviour of biological systems as, in contrast to IBMs, they generally allow for greater mathematical analysis. This analysis can be crucial in forming a mechanistic understanding of biological systems, which is not always apparent from simply studying the results of a large number of repeats of an IBM.

Therefore, the spatial correlations associated with agent proliferation (in conjunction with the dilution of agent density due to domain growth) lower the steady-state density of the agents more than the displacement of agents by domain growth counteracts the spatial correlations established by agent proliferation. In Fig. 5 the effect of GM1 on spatial correlations in both the correlation ODE model and the IBM can be seen. Importantly, we see that as the growth rate is increased the spatial correlations augment. From Fig. 4 this result is to be expected, as domain growth lowers the agent steady-state density but is not effective at reducing spatial correlations. A similar result has previously been observed in the case of agent death [25] . In addition, at the agent steady-state density the spatial correlations do not return to F = 1. This explains why the MFA incorrectly predicts the agent steady-state density, and shows why the correlation ODE model is able to correctly approximate the steady-state density of the IBM. This is because the MFA is only correct when F = 1, which is not the case in the IBM in this scenario with GM1.",

In this case we see that GM2 causes the steady-state density predicted by the MFA to be correct. This is because GM2 is more effective at breaking up agent clusters than GM1, potentially 'freeing-up' one lattice site for four agents in each row/column every growth event. This counteracts the effect of the spatial correlations created by agent proliferation. GM2 also causes agents to change neighbouring agents in the IBM, and so further reduces the spatial correlations associated with agent proliferation. Despite this we see that the correlations ODE model still more accurately predicts the rate at which the agent density evolves, while also accurately approximating the steady-state density in the IBM. In Fig. 7 the effect of GM2 on spatial correlations can be seen in both the correlations ODE model and calculated directly from the IBM. In contrast to GM1 we see that as the growth rate is increased the spatial correlations decrease. We also see that at the steady-state density F = 1, this provides the reason as to why the agent steady-state predicted by the MFA is correct.",

We chose two different, yet potentially biologically relevant growth mechanisms [42] [43] [44] , to highlight how understanding the form of domain growth is crucial. These growth mechanisms originated from thinking about the different ways in which new sites could be added to the IBM domain, and the consequences this may have on agent density. As has been shown in this work, GM1 is an implementation of domain growth that conserves colinear correlations in comparison to diagonal correlations, and GM2 is one that reduces colinear correlations as a rate proportional to the size of the domain. This difference between GM1 and GM2 is why GM2 exhibits a length dependency and GM1 does not. It is important to stress we have used GM1 as an extreme example of growth in which the cell cycles of adjacent cells that are causing the domain to grow are synchronous (i.e. the cells in the underlying tissue), and GM2 as an example of when they are not. In reality, it is unlikely that domain growth in biological systems can be captured by algorithms as simple as GM1 and GM2. However, they represent the simplest and most tractable domain growth mechanisms for this initial study.",

This case represents a very high rate of cell proliferation relative to motility in a biological context. However, we chose these parameters to highlight the accuracy of our approximate correlation ODE model. In situations where P p < P m the correlation ODE model approximates the IBM results even better, as has been shown previously [25, 39] . We have also only looked at the case when P gx = P gy in order to reduce the computational complexity of solving the model equations, however, the results presented here can be trivially extended to cases where P gx = P gy . 24 author/funder.
