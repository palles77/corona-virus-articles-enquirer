Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, 30 but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed 31 to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We systematically reviewed the published 32 literature reporting seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary 33 populations from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, including 60 studies in our qualitative 34 syntheses. MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100% in adult dromedaries 35 supporting geographically wide spread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian 36 Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection 37 measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further 38 investigation -particularly of dromedary movement -and inform vaccination strategy design. 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 .

The dromedary population is highly heterogeneous and 68 spans a wide geographic area stretching from West Africa through to the Middle East and parts of 69 Asia. Knowing when and where dromedaries would need to be targeted, and the likely impact of 70 vaccination, is necessary before further consideration of dromedary vaccination in the wider 71 socioeconomic and cultural context. 72 Here, we systematically reviewed published studies that measured MERS-CoV antibody 73 seroprevalence in dromedaries and/or prevalence of viral RNA in dromedaries. Assuming assay 74 specificity and long-term presence of antibodies after infection, seroprevalence can be used to 75 estimate what proportion of a dromedary population has ever been infected with MERS-CoV. Broken 76 down by age class, this can tell us when most animals encounter the infection for the first time. 77 Additionally, although whole-virus isolation and culture is necessary to confirm whether the shedding .

A study in KSA sampled both local and imported dromedaries within 236 live animal markets found that locally-reared animals had significantly higher prevalence of 237 viral shedding (51). Overall, three studies reported abattoirs and one reported wholesale 238 markets to be associated with an increase in measured prevalence of shedding compared to239 villages, farms and quarantines (23, 46, 51, 64). Much like seroprevalence, RNA positivity 240 was significantly higher in dromedaries bred for meat or milk compared with those used as 241 transport in Burkina Faso, Morocco and Ethiopia, and shedding was higher amongst females, 242 albeit sex and function were highly correlated (23). 243 Potential temporal trends 244 Five studies measured RNA prevalence at a defined site at multiple points in time.

Sequenced isolates from a market in UAE showed lineage 272 switching from week to week which is also supportive of rapid reinfection or coinfection in 273 calves (65).274Longitudinal studies also indicated that maternally acquired immunity may offer some 275 protection. In both studies of calf-mother-pairs conducted in UAE, MERS-CoV infection 276 became highly prevalent in calves between 4-6 months of age when maternally-acquired277 antibody titres had waned (62, 79). Samples from reinfected animals have been found to have 278 lower viral loads, suggesting that past infection may ameliorate future infections (76). Viral 279 load and probability of isolating infectious virus were greater when sampling calves, than 280 adults (44, 79). 281 Discussion 282 The results of our systematic review show that MERS-CoV circulates widely in dromedaries 283 across the Middle East and Africa, but transmission varies spatially, and temporally. The sub-rise of MERS-CoV seroprevalence from 40-90% in juveniles, to 80-100% in adult 289 dromedaries across much of West, North and East Africa and the Middle East, is signature of 290 an endemic disease where the probability of infection increases with time. High 291 seroprevalence in calves <1-year-old in some populations in UAE and KSA suggests high 292 transmission intensity in the Arabian Peninsula, with most dromedaries becoming infected 293 during the first year of life, though maternally acquired antibodies may contribute to 294 seropositivity in young calves(48, 62, 63). The age-dependent seroprevalence values 295 synthesised here should be used to fit models of MERS-CoV transmission in dromedaries and 296 elucidate the likely transmission intensity of the virus in the Middle East and in Africa -a 297 key parameter for estimating vaccination impact. Reporting finer age stratification of young 298 dromedaries would allow a better comparison of transmission intensity in different regions 299 through fitting models of seroconversion. 300 Despite locally-acquired human cases predominantly being reported within the Arabian 301 Peninsula, the major unilateral trade of camels from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian 302 Peninsula (80) means that the endemicity of MERS-CoV in African dromedary populations 303 has implications for the scope of control programs. Viruses isolated in Africa (Egypt, 304 Ethiopia, Morocco, Nigeria, Burkina Faso and most recently Kenya) have all been classified 305 into Clade C (with West African isolates comprising sub-clade C1(81)), while only Clades A 306 and B have been isolated in the Arabian Peninsula (27, 43, 53, 81). Spike region sequences 307 from Pakistan are similar to those from the Arabian Peninsula (57). Further investigation of 308 the geographical restrictions of MERS-CoV clades would help clarify the extent to which 309 MERS-CoV circulates intercontinentally.",

Calf-focused vaccination may reduce the overall number of dromedary316    infections but, the reduced risk of exposure would mean that any remaining infections would 317 likely occur at an older age than in the absence of vaccination. It will therefore be important318 to further investigate the age-dependency of human-dromedary contact patterns and how 319 these vary in different countries and husbandry systems. Vaccination strategies should be 320 evaluated, not only on their likely impact on prevalence of active infection in dromedaries, 321 but also on the age-distribution of infections. 322 Mapping the movement of dromedaries is necessary to understand the underlying spatial 323 transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV. The mixing of dromedaries underpins interaction 324 between infectious and susceptible individuals and therefore the dynamics of MERS-CoV 325 transmission. Live markets and abattoirs which both had higher prevalence of RNA shedding 326 compared to other site-types in multiple studies, are key locations for animal mixing(23, 28, 327 51, 64). Quantitative data describing the movement and trading patterns of dromedary 328 populations will be essential for informing models and considering where potential 329 vaccination should take place. A role for markets as drivers of disease dissemination is 330 characteristic of other zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza (82, 83).",

The temporal studies in this review observed a peak in prevalence of active 333 infection between December and June (29, 49-51). These were conducted in Egypt and KSA 334 where dromedary calving occurs between October and February (84-86), and Nigeria which 335 has a similar calving season (87). Assuming seasonal calving was driving the trend, and to peak between January and May -which overlaps with the peaks 338 observed. If infection is driven by seasonal calving vaccination would need to occur annually 339 prior to the infection of newly susceptible calves. Based on phylogenetic analysis of MERS-340 CoV genomes isolated from humans and dromedaries, a seasonal period of elevated risk of 341 zoonotic transmission was estimated to exist from April through to July (6), however, this is 342 not seen consistently in the epidemiology of primary human MERS-CoV cases reported to 343 WHO (88). Further investigation of potential seasonality has been highlighted as a priority by 344 the FAO-OIE-WHO MERS-CoV Technical Working Group (2). 345 The results of longitudinal studies included in this review demonstrate re-infection of 346 dromedaries despite high titres of MERS-CoV specific antibodies being present in their sera. 347 Unfortunately, the degree and duration of protection afforded by maternally-acquired 348 antibodies and those acquired from infection is unclear. Informative surveys of a better proxy 349 for protective immunity in dromedaries would improve the accuracy of models of reinfection 350 and the likely effects of vaccination. 351 Although we found maximum duration of RNA shedding to range from 7-45 days across 352 studies, intermittent shedding or rapid reinfection has been seen to occur for 6 weeks which 353 complicates interpretation of RT-PCR derived RNA shedding results for infectious period. A 354 controlled challenge study in 4 dromedaries performed daily sampling and saw the maximum 355 duration of shedding to be 35 days post inoculation, with infectious virus (as determined by 356 plaque assay) isolatable for the first 7 days (89). However, the biological relevance of the 357 challenge dose is not known. More frequent sampling that includes genotyping and captures 358 of the onset of shedding is needed to more accurately estimate the duration of infectiousness 359 following a single natural infection.360Limitations of our study include that a single author completed the systematic search and data 361 extraction.

Van Kerkhove).374 Conclusions 375 Our findings provide strong evidence that MERS-CoV is endemic in dromedary populations 376 across much of West, North, East Africa and the Middle East, in agreement with the similar 377 systematic review conducted in parallel with our own (11). Calves are likely to play a central 378 role in sustaining circulation of MERS-CoV and should be a target of potential dromedary 379 vaccination. However, the potential for mass vaccination of calves to change the age 380 distribution of infected individuals should be investigated through mathematical modelling of 381 transmission dynamics in dromedary populations and considered in the context of age-382 dependent human-camel contact frequency patterns. Sites where dromedaries mix may also 383 play a role in driving transmission. A better understanding of dromedary husbandry and trade 384 patterns, as well as quarantine facilities, is needed to identify where dromedaries are infected 385 with MERS-CoV -critical for focussing potential vaccination strategies. Although in a few 386 studies, prevalence of infection appears to peak in the first half of the year, which may be 387 facilitated by the increase in susceptible animals after the calving season, further studies are viral shedding and immunity in the animal host and should ideally be capable of 390 distinguishing co-circulating MERS-CoV lineages. 391 These remaining gaps in our understanding of MERS-CoV transmission dynamics in 392 dromedary populations agree with the prioritized research outlined in the FAO-OIE-WHO 393",
