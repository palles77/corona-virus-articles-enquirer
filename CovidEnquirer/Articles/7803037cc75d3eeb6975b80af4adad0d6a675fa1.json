Methods: Four thousands and forty-eight healthy adults aged \u226518 years were randomized (1:1) to receive one dose of either the adjuvanted split virion (3.75 g hemagglutinin antigen [HA]/AS03) or non-adjuvanted (15 g HA) vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition [HI] antibody response was evaluated before vaccination and at Days 21, 42 and 182 (Month 6). Safety of the study vaccines was evaluated during the entire study duration. Results: At Day 21, both study vaccines induced HI immune responses meeting the US regulatory criteria in subjects 18-64 years (seroprotection rate [SPR]: 98.0% [97.1-98.6]; seroconversion rate [SCR]: 89.7% [88.0-91.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 91.4% [89.9-92.8]; SCR: 74.6% [72.3-76.9] in the non-adjuvanted group) and >64 years of age (SPR: 86.0% [82.5-89.0]; SCR: 75.3% [71.1-79.2] in the AS03adjuvanted group; SPR: 69.1% [64.6-73.3]; SCR: 56.7% [52.0-61.3] in the non-adjuvanted group). The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced higher HI geometric mean titers than the non-adjuvanted vaccine at all time points. At Month 6, only subjects 18-64 years of age from both vaccine groups still met the US regulatory criteria (SPR: 82.1% [80.0-84.1]; SCR: 62.3% [59.6-64.8] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 75.3% [72.9-77.5]; SCR: 53.7% [ 51.0-56.4] in the non-adjuvanted group). Protective efficacy was not evaluated due to low number of RT-qPCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza cases. Through Month 12, 216 serious adverse events (in 157 subjects: 84 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 73 in the non-adjuvanted group) and 12 potentially immune mediated diseases (5 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 7 in the non-adjuvanted group) were reported. Conclusion: A single dose of either adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine induced protective HI antibody levels against the A/California/7/2009 strain that persisted through Month 6 in the 18-64 years population.",

They were randomized (allocation ratio 1:1) to receive one dose of either a monovalent AS03-adjuvanted 3.75 g HA A/California/7/2009 pandemic influenza vaccine or a non-adjuvanted 15 g HA A/California/7/2009 pandemic influenza vaccine. The enrolment stratification was by age (1:1:1:1; 18-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-64 years, \u226565 years). The subjects and study personnel involved in evaluating end points were blinded to the intervention administered. Double blinding was not possible because the vaccine preparation required mixing of AS03 and A(H1N1)pdm09 antigen from two vials. Randomization was performed using a central, internet-based system that balanced groups with respect to center, age strata and previous seasonal influenza vaccination.",

The frequency of solicited local adverse events in this study was higher in the AS03-adjuvanted versus the non-adjuvanted treatment group and the frequency of solicited adverse events were comparatively lower in the >64 years age group. Previous clinical trials of influenza A(H1N1/)pdm09 vaccines [17, 45, 2, 46] comparing safety outcomes between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines reported similar observations, with higher frequency of both local and general adverse events with adjuvanted vaccines compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines. In our study, we did not observe any differences between the two vaccine groups in terms of SAEs considered as possibly related to vaccination (1 in each group). Although an imbalance in the number of fatal SAEs was observed between the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted group (6 versus 1), none were considered to be related to vaccination and they all occurred in subjects with a relevant medical history.",
