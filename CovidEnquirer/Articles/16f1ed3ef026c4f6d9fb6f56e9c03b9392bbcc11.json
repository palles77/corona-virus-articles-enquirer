            "text": "The impact of the next pandemic influenza is likely to be far greater, by orders of magnitude, than most bioterrorism (BT) scenarios. A written pandemic emergency plan and establishment of emergency management teams are critical to mounting a coordinated and effective response to what will be a catastrophic event. Members of these teams should include public health, medical, emergency response and public safety officials, organized at each local, state and federal level. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent anthrax attacks have substantially increased funding and support for bioterrorism planning in the United States. Thus, public health officials have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen current systems' planning efforts by promoting dual use bioterrorism/pandemic influenza plans. Combining lessons learned from the 2001 terrorist incidents, recent preevent smallpox vaccine programs and the history of past influenza pandemics, more effective strategies can be developed. For example, enhanced influenza surveillance systems can provide data that will not only provide early identification of a novel influenza strain, but will provide more timely recognition of other outbreaks of infectious diseases, including public health threats that may initially present as an influenza-like illness (ILI). In recent years, we have witnessed emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats that have presented us with challenges similar to those posed by an influenza pandemic. Such events highlight the need for advance planning to ensure an optimal response to a health emergency that is certain to be unpredictable, complex, rapidly evolving and accompanied by considerable public alarm. While advance warning for a terrorist attack is unlikely, the warning already exists for a possible new influenza strain, as evidenced by the recent cases of H5N1 in Hong Kong and the rapid global spread of cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

Cross-department planning will facilitate a more effective response to pandemic influenza, strengthen ties between public health and emergency response sectors and complement other planning efforts for not only pandemic influenza but for other emergencies including acts of terrorism.

One such area of overlap is surveillance. Global and domestic laboratory and disease surveillance must be strengthened to increase the likelihood of early detection and tracking of pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist event. Improvements in state public health laboratory capacity through support of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) has enhanced rapid testing for influenza. Because many potential bioterrorist agents initially cause symptoms that resemble an influenza-like illness (ILI), it is critical for every State to have rule-out influenza testing capabilities available on a year-round basis. Timely reporting of outbreaks and surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) are directly relevant to tracking the progression and intensity of influenza activity and may provide an early indication of a bioterrorist event.",

A key lesson learned from the anthrax attacks was that the public demands up-to-date information on an ongoing basis throughout the emergency. Factual information presented by trusted public health officials can assist in minimizing fear and hysteria. Most health crises are similar to the recent anthrax attacks, where only a few cases are ultimately diagnosed, but the bulk of the populace seeks information on a rapidly unfolding scenario. Demand for factual information will only be heightened for a highly contagious disease entity such as pandemic influenza. Data generated as a result of a robust surveillance system can assist public health efforts in minimizing hysteria and preventing the dissemination of misinformation regarding the evolving pandemic: has the novel virus arrived; geographical areas of the country most severely affected; whether disease activity is increasing or decreasing and groups most severely affected.",

Unlike the anthrax events of 2001 where there was no forewarning, surveillance should provide days to months of warning for a pandemic, while the pandemic itself will last for several months or years. There will be no ''unaffected'' areas, as the pandemic influenza virus will be present virtually simultaneously in all parts of the country. Mutual aid from either the federal government or other regions of the country will be unlikely, as all public health, medical and emergency resources will be dedicated to the disaster at hand locally. Support from the federal government will be limited in such a scenario; despite the fact, such assistance usually comes during other states of emergency. Resource deficiencies will exist for inpatient/outpatient medical services, biologic products, and key personnel. Absenteeism among essential first-line medical and emergency workers will impact services rendered, as no one will be immune to infections from the novel pandemic influenza virus. Vaccine will be the primary prevention tool, assuming that vaccine will be able to be developed in a timeframe that will be useful. Promoting adult immunization programs, including increasing the use of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine during interpandemic years will also strengthen the public health response.",
