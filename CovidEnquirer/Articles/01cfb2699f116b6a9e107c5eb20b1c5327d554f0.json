Cox asserts that annually 1 person or fewer in the United States will experience an adverse effect because of fluoroquinolone use in poultry. He reduces 10-fold my referenced risk for persons acquiring Campylobacter infections from poultry (2) . His unrealistically low estimate is not given in his referenced citation. His estimated risk is also much lower than in the reference 2, which Cox himself quotes, \"Poultry is the most common cause of sporadic cases of campylobacteriosis in the United States\" (Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture) (3). Cox knows that his assertion (4) that poultry make little or no contribution to human Campylobacter infections has been extensively examined and found to be wrong. Indeed, an entire section in a recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determination was written about the unreliability of Cox's testimony and these assertions, a finding made by both the FDA commissioner and an administrative law judge (5,6).",

If 20% of these infections were caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter spp., then 6,000 persons would potentially have their therapy and outcome compromised, rather than the 1 person that Cox would have us believe. More realistic is the figure of 24,000 persons estimated previously to be at risk of having an adverse outcome (or \u2248285 persons for every 1 million chickens treated with fluoroquinolones) (1).

Innate immunity, the initial response to a pathogen, is potentially capable of eradicating infection. Even when the innate immune response cannot eliminate a virus, it may substantially reduce viral load, reduce pathology, facilitate clearing of the virus by the adaptive immune response, and slow the spread of infection (1). As biodefense medications, IFNs and IFN-inducers are under development for aerosolized delivery to the lungs (2,3). Conventional IFN administration by injection often results in low concentrations at target sites and high concentrations in circulation, which may cause serious side effects. Aerosolized delivery minimizes side effects and produces more rapid clinical responses. Inhaled IFNs have proven to be well tolerated and beneficial for rhinovirus infection (4) and pulmonary tuberculosis (5) .",

Cytokine storms can result in autoimmune reactions, tissue damage, or septic shock. High IFN doses for long periods may exacerbate autoimmunity. However, despite similar cytokine storms (9), some severe acute respiratory syndrome patients respond well to IFN therapy (10) . Optimal formulation and regimen of IFN administration could be crucial to effective anti-H5N1 prophylaxis.
