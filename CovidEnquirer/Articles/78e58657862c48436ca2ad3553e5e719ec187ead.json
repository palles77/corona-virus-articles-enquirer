Clinically, specific drugs to treat FCV have not yet been developed. Here, IgG was extracted from inactivated FCV-immunized horse sera. Equine F(ab') 2 fragments were obtained from pepsin-digested IgG and then purified by protein-G column chromatography. In our study, equine immunoglobulin F(ab') 2 fragments showed efficient neutralizing activity in vitro against FCV and had therapeutic and prophylactic effects in FCVinfected cats. The anti-FCV-specific F(ab') 2 fragment can significantly alleviate the clinical symptoms of FCVinfected cats and reduce the viral loads of the trachea, lung and spleen. These results indicate that the F(ab') 2 fragment prepared from inactivated FCV-immunized horses may be used as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for diseases caused by FCV.",

Cats, tigers, cheetahs and other wild felines are susceptible, kittens aged 6 to 84 days are mainly infected, with a mortality rate of 67% [1, 2] . After FCV infection, the animals have oral ulcers, chronic stomatitis, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and pneumonia. FCV is distributed worldwide and is highly contagious in felines. Once the kittens are infected, FCV proliferates in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract, causing feline upper respiratory tract disease (FURTD) [3] . The clinical symptoms are relieved 14 to 18 days after the infection, but the FCV is still excreted through saliva and nasal secretions, which is the main reason for the substantial spread of FCV [3] .",

In addition to synthetic compounds, Korea red ginseng extracts (KRGE) and ginsenosides, grape seed extracts (GSE), ginger extracts, clove extracts and phaeophyta extracts can also resist FCV [6] [7] [8] [9] . In past studies, equine IgG was gradually favored by researchers as a blood-derived biological product that is easy to obtain in large quantities and has a low cost. Antibodies, particularly F(ab') 2 fragments, are easy to purify in large quantities and are inexpensive and have been reported to prevent Rabies Virus (RV) and West Nile virus (WNV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola Virus (EBOV) [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Thereafter, the F(ab') 2 fragments were produced from the IgG digested by pepsin to avoid potential allergic reactions between different species of animals. We evaluated the protective effects of equine IgG (in vitro) and F(ab') 2 fragments (in vitro and in vivo) on FCV. First, we determined the neutralization titer of the IgG. Then, the neutralizing activity of the F(ab') 2 fragments was confirmed by Indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization assays. Furthermore, infected cats treated with purified F(ab') 2 fragments showed a significantly reduced viral load and FCV shedding in the trachea and lungs. This lowers the score of clinical symptoms and reduces mortality in cats. Immunohistochemical staining also confirmed that F(ab') 2 reduced FCV in tissues. These results suggest that equine neutralizing F(ab') 2 fragments may protect cats against FCV pathogenic infection.",

Antibodies prepared from horse sera have the advantages of low cost and process maturation and can produce specific antibodies against multiple antigenic determinants. The removal of Fc fragments from IgG is significant in alleviating allergic reactions in animals, making antibodies safer for cats [17] . More importantly, polyclonal F(ab') 2 fragments recognize and bind to multiple antigenic determinants of FCV, which may avoid potential antibody escape. Moreover, the F(ab') 2 molecular weight is between those of the IgG and Fab fragments. High-molecular-weight IgG has difficulty entering into tissues through blood vessels, which results in delays of antigens neutralizing tissues [18] . Although low-molecular-weight Fab can diffuse into the tissue more easily through the blood vessels, the effect of neutralizing the antigen by the rapid removal via filtration of the kidney is impaired. Second, the half-life of Fab in vivo is less than that of F(ab') 2 , which results in F(ab') 2 being superior to Fab under the same dosage and time [19] .",

We found that when the virus shedding amount exceeded 7527 copies/\u03bcL or 7866 copies/\u03bcL, the animal died. Notably, before we obtained these data, Druet and Hennet et al. found a significant correlation between oral ulceration and FCV load in cats [20] , which may also be used as a predictor of survival in animals infected with FCV. When given a certain dose of pF(ab') 2 , the viral loads in the cats' tracheas, lungs and spleens were significantly decreased in both the preventive and therapeutic groups (p < 0.05). These organs produce the feline junctional adhesion molecule A (fJAM-A), a FCV-specific receptor [21] . The reduction in viral load and virus shedding demonstrated that pF(ab') 2 inhibited the proliferation of FCV in cats. The immunohistochemistry results also confirmed this phenomenon.",

Anti-FCV F(ab') 2 fragments prepared with horse antibodies reduced viral load in feline tracheas, lungs and spleens and prevented FCV in cats in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments. Thus, horses immunized with inactivated FCV can be used as a source for the development of F(ab') 2 fragments. However, the detection of related immune parameters during immunization should be increased. These studies will further confirm that they can be used as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for diseases caused by FCV.
