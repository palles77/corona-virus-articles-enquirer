We previously reported that human \u03b2-defensin 2 (HBD 2) activates primary innate immunity against viral infection and suggested that it plays a role in the induction of the adaptive immune response. We analyzed the mechanisms by which HBD 2 primes innate antiviral immunity and polarized activation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein (S RBD) as a model antigen. The expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2), type I interferons, (IFNs), and proinflammatory mediators was enhanced in S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells. S RBD-HBD 2 treatment also enhanced phosphorylation and activation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 and IFN regulatory factor 3 compared to S RBD alone. Finally, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD interacted with C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), and Nod2 was involved in HBD 2-mediated CCR2 signaling, which was associated with the activation and M1 polarization of THP-1 cells. Therefore, HBD 2 promotes CCR2-mediated Nod2 signaling, which induces production of type I IFNs and an inflammatory response, and enhances primary innate immunity leading to an effective adaptive immune response to HBD 2-conjugated antigen.",

The functions of AMPs in defense against various infections are better characterized than their role as innate immune modulators (Boyton and Openshaw, 2002) . Defensins are small cationic AMPs and are found in various organisms including mammals, insects, and plants. Among them, \u03b2-defensins are primarily produced by epithelial cells and leukocytes in vertebrates (Stolzenberg et al., 1997) . Immature dendritic cells (DCs) can be activated by \u03b2-defensins, and \u03b2-defensins also inhibit infection by Haemophilus influenzae and viruses (Zhao et al., 2016; Lafferty et al., 2017) . Inactivation of human \u03b2-defensins (HBDs) leads to the recurrent airway infections experienced by patients with cystic fibrosis (Smith et al., 1996) . Also, a lack of human \u03b2-defensin 2 (HBD 2) results in immune dysfunction, such as reduced numbers of B and regulatory T cells, resulting in decreased production of antigen (Ag)-specific immunoglobulin A (Lugering et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2007) . Therefore, an understanding of the regulatory mechanism by which AMPs modulate the immune response during the early stage of viral infection is critically needed to deal with various diseases caused by virus infection.",

            "text": "Virus infection of host cells triggers innate antiviral responses, which are initiated via pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling pathways (Ishii et al., 2008) . Among the PRR families, nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2) is an important mediator of the innate immune response to viral infection, and induces expression of type I interferons (IFNs) to promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and restrict viral replication (Wiese et al., 2017) . Furthermore, Nod2-deficient mice exhibit decreased production of IFNs and increased susceptibility to viral infection (Sabbah et al., 2009) . Presumably, the ability of a virus to counteract innate antiviral immunity during the early stage of infection influences pathogenicity and disease severity (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . Type I IFNs play a major role in the antiviral innate immune response by upregulating the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2019.05.004 Received 8 April 2019; Received in revised form 13 May 2019; Accepted 16 May 2019 production of antiviral proteins and the recruitment of immune cells (Haller et al., 2006) . Production of type I IFN is initiated by ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic viral sensors in response to detection of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded RNA (Kato et al., 2011; Li and Zhong, 2018) . Stimulated viral sensors activate downstream signaling pathways, leading to expression of transcription factors including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which drive IFN-\u03b2 expression (Yoneyama et al., 2004) . However, some viruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), inhibit these type I IFN induction pathways . For example, various proteins of MERS-CoV, including M protein, papain-like protease protein (PLpro), and accessory proteins 4a and 4b, are antagonists of IFNs (Shokri et al., 2019) . Accordingly, the virulence of MERS-CoV is linked to its immune evasion mechanisms, such as suppression of IFN production during the early stage of infection, induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inactivation of T cells with downregulation of Ag presentation (Niemeyer et al., 2013) .",

Macrophages are present in the respiratory mucosa, such as in the lung and various fluid compartments, where the detection of and the response to infection occur. Due to their location, macrophages detect viral Ags first and promote an antiviral innate immune response as well as an Ag-specific adaptive immune response by presenting Ags to T-cells (Manicassamy et al., 2010) . We previously reported that HBD 2 promotes an antiviral innate immune response in macrophage-like THP-1 cells and elicits an enhanced Ag-specific and virus-neutralizing antibody (Ab) response in vivo using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein (S RBD) as a model Ag (Kim et al., 2018) . Moreover, the type I IFN response and the production of primary antiviral molecules such as Nod2 were enhanced by S RBD-HDB 2 treatment of THP-1 cells (Kim et al., 2018) . Consequently, we assumed that modulation of Nod2 signaling by HBD 2 would prevent infection by viruses that suppress innate antiviral immunity. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which HBD 2 enhances the type I IFN immune response in THP-1 cells by modulating Nod2 signaling pathways using HBD 2-conjugated S RBD of MERS-CoV.",

S RBD-HBD 2 significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and Nod2 by 2.18-and 7.35-fold, respectively, compared to S RBD alone-treated THP-1 cells ( Fig. 2A and B) . The expression of TNF\u03b1, an NF-\u03baB-dependent proinflammatory cytokine, was increased in S RBD-HBD 2-treated cells compared with that in S RBD alone-treated cells, albeit not significantly so (Fig. 2C) . We next assessed the levels of the Nod2-associated signal transducing mediators, receptor interacting protein-2 (RIP2) and IRF3, in S RBD-or S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 3) . As expected, treatment with S RBD-HBD 2 remarkably upregulated the phosphorylation of RIP2 and IRF3 and the Nod2 protein level. In addition, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD reduced I\u03baB\u03b1 accumulation, degradation of which requires NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 3C) . Therefore, HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment induces the production of the type I IFN, IFN-\u03b2, and the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1, through Nod2-associated RIP2 response by activating the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB.",

In addition, the \u03b2-defensin-conjugated proteins induced CCR2-specific chemotaxis on CCR2-transfected HEK293 cells, human peripheral blood monocytes, and mouse peritoneal exudate cells in a dose-dependent manner (R\u00f6hrl et al., 2010b) .

CCR2 and S RBD-HBD 2 co-localized, suggesting a direct interaction, but no such co-localization with CCR2 was observed for S RBD alone (data not shown). We next evaluated whether the interaction of HBD 2 with CCR2 mediates intracellular signaling. Interestingly, the significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced IFN-\u03b2 expression by S RBD-HBD 2 was abrogated by the CCR2 antagonist, RS 102,895 (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the Nod2 expression and Nod2-associated RIP2 and IRF3 expression enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) by S RBD-HBD 2 was abrogated by the CCR2 antagonist ( Fig. 4C-E) , as was TNF-\u03b1, whose expression is dependent on NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 4F) .

In our previous report, a proinflammatory cytokine response, which requires the activation of NF-\u03baB, was induced by HBD 2 (Kim et al., 2018) . Additionally, early stimulation of an innate immune response is dependent on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and/or Nod2-triggered NF-\u03baB signaling (Tsai et al., 2011) . We thus determined whether the HBD 2-mediated enhancement is due to Nod2-associated signaling because Nod2 expression was enhanced by S RBD-HBD 2 (Fig. 5) . S RBD-HBD 2 co-localized with Nod2, suggesting an interaction (Fig. 5A) , but no such co-localization with Nod2 occurred for S RBD without HBD 2 conjugation (data not shown). Consequently, we speculated that Nod2 interacts with S RBD-HBD 2 and that Nod2-mediated signaling is involved in HBD 2-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB. We evaluated the influence of Nod2 signaling on HBD 2-mediated type I IFN and proinflammatory responses using the inhibitor of Nod2 signaling, GSK 717. GSK 717 abrogated the HBD 2-mediated (p < 0.01) enhanced expression of IFN-\u03b2, RIP2, and IRF3 ( Fig. 5B-D) . Additionally, a Nod2 inhibitor abrogated the enhanced expression of TNF-\u03b1 in HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 5E ). These observations suggest that Nod2 functions as an intracellular signal transmediator in HBD 2-induced activation of type I IFN production and the inflammatory response.",

Expression of the M1-type macrophage marker genes, CD16 and CD86, was markedly downregulated by the CCR2 and Nod2 inhibitors compared to the control ( Fig. 6A and B) . Interestingly, expression of CD14, a marker of early activation of macrophages, was stably upregulated in both S RBD alone-and S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells, while CD14 expression was markedly downregulated by pretreatment with a CCR2 or Nod2 inhibitor, although the CCR2 inhibitor did not completely reverse the HBD 2-mediated enhanced expression of CD14 (Fig. 6C) . These results demonstrate that CCR2-mediated activation of Nod2 signaling pathway by S RBD-HBD 2 is associated with the activation and M1 polarization of macrophage-like THP-1 cells.",

Innate immunity not only precedes the Ag-specific adaptive immune response but also enables a long-lasting memory response by innate Agpresenting cells (APCs), which interact with adaptive immune cells. Innate immune cells, such as macrophages and mast cells, recruited into infected sites produce a wide range of cytokines that regulate the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory responses and so maintain immunological homeostasis (Gallenga et al., 2019) . Cytokines have pleiotropic effects on the functions of immune cells and immune responses that constitute the host defense against infectious agents. For instance, members of the IL-1 family, which are produced by macrophages and mast cells, are important regulators of the innate immune response and play a role in inflammatory processes (Varvara et al., 2018) . Several IL-1 family cytokines are pro-inflammatory, while others, including IL-37, IL-38, IL-1Ra, and IL-36Ra, are anti-inflammatory . In addition, IL-1 indirectly participates in T-lymphocyte-mediated immunity by inducing helper type 2 T-cell polarization and the formation of Abs by plasma cells by producing IL-6 (Gallenga et al., 2019) . These findings suggest that further studies on modulation of the balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and network among innate immune cells, such as M1/M2 macrophage polarization, would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches for immunological disorders.",
