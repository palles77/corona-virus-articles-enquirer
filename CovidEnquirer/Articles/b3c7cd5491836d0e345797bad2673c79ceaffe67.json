However, the efficacy of vaccines and remedies for infectious diseases is limited by the high mutation rates of viruses, especially, RNA viruses. Here, we comprehensively review the effectiveness of several probiotics and paraprobiotics (sterilized probiotics) for the prevention or treatment of virally-induced infectious diseases. We discuss the unique roles of these agents in modulating the cross-talk between commensal bacteria and the mucosal immune system. In addition, we provide an overview of the unique mechanism by which viruses are eliminated through the stimulation of type 1 interferon production by probiotics and paraprobiotics via the activation of dendritic cells. Although further detailed research is necessary in the future, probiotics and/or paraprobiotics are expected to be among the rational adjunctive options for the treatment of various viral diseases.",

Recently, \"ghost probiotics\" or paraprobiotics were reported to retain their immunomodulatory potency beyond their viability [33] . Probiotics contain immunostimulatory substances such as lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, and nucleic acid, which are Tolllike receptor (TLR) ligands, and muramyl dipeptide, which is a Nod-like receptor ligand [34] . In the following sections, we focus on the effects of probiotics including paraprobiotics on viral infections.

The frequency and severity of cold symptoms and the number of subjects with rhinovirus infection in the LGG group were lower than those of the control group, although the difference between the groups did not reach significance [38] . When LGG was administered for 4 weeks to children with gastroenteritis who were positive for either rotavirus or Cryptosporidium species in stool, a significant increase in serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels post-intervention was observed in children with rotavirus-induced diarrhea who received LGG. Among the children with cryptosporidial diarrhea, those receiving LGG showed a significant improvement in intestinal permeability [39] . The mechanisms by which probiotics exert immunomodulatory effects are not completely understood. However, LGG was demonstrated to modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses, particularly those against gastrointestinal pathogens, resulting in increased levels of serum IgG and secretory IgA targeting enteric pathogens including rotavirus [39] .",

The administration of L. lactis JCM5805 resulted in a significant decrease in the cumulative number of days of incidence of \"cough\" and \"feverishness\", which were defined as the major symptoms of an influenza-like illness, as compared with the control group. Furthermore, when PBMCs from the volunteers treated with L. lactis JCM 5805 were cultured with inactivated human influenza virus A/H1N1 (A/PR/8/34), the expression of IFN-\u03b1 showed a higher tendency and that of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) was significantly elevated as compared with the control group. These results suggest that the intake of L. lactis JCM5805 can prevent the pathogenesis of an influenza-like illness via the enhancement of an IFN-\u03b1-mediated response to the influenza virus [56] . In two separate studies, the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and the mRNA level of ISG15 in PBMCs were significantly higher in groups treated with L. lactis JCM 5805 as compared to the corresponding control groups [57, 58] . In addition, Sakata et al. reported that the intake of yogurt containing L. lactis JCM 5805 significantly reduced the cumulative incidence rate of influenza among schoolchildren in a rural area of Japan [59] . Finally Fujii et al. showed the effects of oral L. lactis JCM 5805 on systemic and mucosal immunological parameters of healthy volounteers in winter (common cold season in Japan). After 4 continuous weeks administration, L. lactis JCM 5805 significantly reduced cumulative days of symptom of sore throat, compared with control. In L. lactis JCM 5805 group, change in secretory IgA levels in saliva and phagocytic activity of neutrophil were significantly lower than those of initial level, but not in the placebo group, although they could not reach statistical differences between groups at endpoint [60] .

The type 1 IFN family includes IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, which serve as components of the firstline defense against infection by blocking viral replication [65] . The induction of type 1 IFNs is mostly associated with viral infections and it is well known that pathogenic bacteria stimulate IFN-\u03b1 production [66] . However, nonpathogenic bacteria including probiotics used in food preparation have been less intensively studied regarding their ability to stimulate DC-mediated IFNs induction [67] . As described separately in detail, we previously screened various lactic acid bacteria for their ability to stimulate IFN-\u03b1 production by pDCs and found that L. lactis JCM 5805 was the most potent stimulator of type 1 IFN production [67] .",

As a result of this direct activation of DCs by L. lactis JCM 5805, the major type 1 and type 3 IFNs (i.e., IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03bb) were found to be induced efficiently. However, IFN-\u03b1 production was completely abolished in dendritic cells obtained from TLR9 or MyD88 knockout mice. Thus, these data strongly suggested that L. lactis JCM 5805 stimulated IFN-\u03b1 production via TLR9/MyD88 signaling. Furthermore, we examined whether IFN-\u03b1 production was induced by CpG DNA, which is a known TLR9 agonist, or DNA extracted from L. lactis JCM 5805. Both CpG DNA and the DNA extracted from L. lactis JCM 5805 strongly induced IFN production. In addition, L. lactis JCM 5805 was observed to be specifically taken up by pDC, suggesting that its phagocytosis played an important role in activating pDCs and consequently inducing the production of IFNs [67] .",

In the intestinal pDCs from the mice treated with L. lactis JCM 5805, type 1 IFN expression was significantly elevated, while a remarkable preventive effect against the infiltration of neutrophils into the lung tissue was observed. A significant increase in the expression of genes with antiviral activities including IFN-inducible mRNAs such as Isg15, Oasl2 (2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like 2), and Rsad2 (radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2) was observed upon treatment with L. lactis JCM 5805. Although lung is distantly located from the contact site (intestinal Peyer's patches) and L. lactis JCM 5805 cannot stimulate local pDCs in the lung directly, oral L. lactis JCM 5805 treatment resulted in a strong resistance against parainfluenza virus infection in vivo [68] .",

Besides this direct interaction with viruses, it is also possible that L. lactis JCM 5805 competes for viral receptors on the surface of target cells, produces antimicrobial and potentially antiviral substances, and stimulates host-cell immune defense systems. Thus, in the future, it is necessary to test whether L. lactis JCM 5805 can also directly bind and inactivate viruses, since the resulting data could provide a basis for novel approaches to inactivate viruses and reduce the risk of mucosa-associated viral infections.",

Although the benefits of vaccines and antiviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases are obvious, their effectiveness is hindered by the large number of viral species and their subtypes as well as the high mutation rate of viruses. Since viruses evolve constantly and produce a serologically diverse viral population, it is challenging to establish an effective means of protecting humans from viral infections. There have been several clinical reports regarding the use of probiotics or paraprobiotics for the prophylaxis or treatment of infectious diseases. Here, we reviewed the literature regarding several probiotic or paraprobiotic agents based on the papers which described single paraprobiotics / probiotics in clinical trial to avoid the crosstalk or mutual interference between probiotics. Such agents are considered to be safe, affordable and easy to consume because of their long history of use in foods.",

Especially, they use TLR9 for the recognition of microbial nucleic acids by detecting unmethylated CpG motifs of DNA and TLR7 for the recognition of microbial RNA or synthetic guanosine analogs. The activation of pDCs by ligand binding to TLRs leads to the production of type 1 IFNs. L. lactis JCM 5805 was specifically taken up by pDCs and its DNA extracts strongly induced IFN production. These observations suggest that the phagocytosis of L. lactis JCM 5805 by pDCs plays an important role in activating pDCs and stimulating IFN production via TLR9/MyD88 signaling. IFN-\u03b1 plays an important role in mediating the antiviral immune response by inducing the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells, which contributes to the host defense against viral infection. Microscopic observations of human pDCs stimulated by L. lactis JCM5805 are also shown (Inset). The pDCs stained with anti-B220 (purple) are in the process of phagocytosing fluorescein isothiocyanate-stained L. lactis JCM5805 (green) [55] .
