After washing with PBS supplemented with 4.5% sucrose (w/v), the cells were scraped free from the flasks with a rubber policeman, transferred into a centrifuge tube, and spun down at 800 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 : C. The pellets were then dispersed in 0.1 ml of 2% low-melting agarose (Seaplaque Agarose, FMC Corporation, Rockland, MD, U.S.A.) and the cells were spun down again by low-speed centrifugation. After gelification, cellular pellets were cut into small blocks (1 mm 3 ) with a razor blade, dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in Araldite 502. Thin sections (70-90 nm thick) were mounted on 400-mesh naked-nickel grids and processed for immunocytochemical labelling using colloidal gold as a marker (Garzon et al., 1982) . The grids were first floated for 5 min on a drop of TBS (0.05 M Tris-HC1, 0.15 M NaC1, pH 8.0) containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature on a drop of a 200-fold dilution of the rabbit anti-TCV hyperimmune serum in TBS-Tween. After washing in TBS-Tween, grids were incubated on a drop of TBS-diluted protein A-gold (PAG) complex. The colloidal gold particles in the PAG complex were 8 nm in diameter and were prepared according to the method described by Frens (1973) , with the modifications suggested by de Mey (1983) . The sections were finally washed with TBS, rinsed in distilled water and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (Fracca and Parks, 1965) .

The fringe of small granular projections appeared to be masked, probably by immunoglobulins, following the incubation with the rabbit anti-TCV hyperimmune sera (Fig. 5b) . Two rows of gold granules were frequently present at the surface of immunolabelled viral particles (Fig. 5c) . The gold granules were generally located near the tip of both types of surface projections, whereas the interior of the virus was not labelled. Only a few gold granules were observed around viral particles that lost their surface projections (Fig. 5d ). This suggests that the polyclonal anti-TCV hyperimmune serum contained mainly antibodies to the antigenic determinants situated at the surface of the virions.",

In these cells, the virus rapidly established a productive infection without previous adaptation and without obvious cytopathic effect. Virus replication was initially suggested by direct EM of supernatant fluids and by the demonstration of a specific cell-free HA activity (Dea et al., 1986 }. The post-embedding protein A-gold immunocytochemical approach was used for the identification and localization of virus (antigens) produced in TCV-infected HRT-18 cells. A specific antiserum, obtained after immunization of rabbits with the purified egg-adapted Minnesota strain of TCV, was used as the immunoreactant. The strong positive reaction observed in TCVinfected cells and the absence of labelling in the various controls confirmed that the virus which replicated in HRT-18 cells was identical to the original virus cultivated in embryonated turkey eggs.",

Although the various events of the viral morphogenesis were not investigated in detail in this study, absence of viral antigens in the nucleus, budding and accumulation of progeny virus particles in the lumina of cytoplasmic cisternae, transport through smooth-walled intracellular vesicles, and absence of viral budding at the surface of the cells are all features shared with other members of the Coronaviridae family (Doughri et al., 1976; Siddell et al., 1982; Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1985) , including the avian infectious bronchitis (IBV) virus (Nazerian and Cunningham, 1968; Chasey and Alexander, 1976) . The results of the present study also suggest that the progeny TCV particles are released from the cells, by a mechanism involving the cellular secretory apparatus. Such a mechanism has also been suggested in cases of mouse hepatitis virus (Sturman and Holmes, 1983; Tooze and Tooze, 1985) and for IBV (Chasey and Alexander, 1976) .",

However, the presence of additional granular projections has not been described for IBV, although the virus possesses a hemagglutinating activity (Berry et al., 1964; Biswal et al., 1966; Bingham and Almeida, 1977 ) . This major morphological difference between these two unrelated avian coronaviruses has not been mentioned in previous descriptions of the bluecomb virus (Panigraphy et al., 1973; Naqi et al., 1975) . This study also provides the first evidence on the replication and the propagation of an avian coronavirus in cell cultures derived from human tissues, or in mammalian cell cultures, without previous adaptation. HRT-18 cells have been previously reported to be susceptible to enteropathogenic strains of bovine (Laporte et al., 1980; King et al., 1985; Reynolds et al., 1985 ) , canine and human coronaviruses (Laporte et al., 1980; Hogue et al., 1984 ) . The high tropism of these viruses for mature enterocytes has been demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro studies (Doughri et al., 1976; Sturman and Holmes, 1983; Pomeroy, 1984; Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1985) . The susceptibility of the transformed cell line to these viruses may be related to the fact that it has maintained many characteristics of the normal mature enterocytes, particularly the presence of microvilli on which the viral receptors are probably located (Tompkins et al., 1974 ) . Another possibility would be that HRT-18 cells have receptors for both calf and turkey coronaviruses as a result of oncogenic transformation. Further work is needed to understand this particular tropism of TCV and its significance in the biology and epidemiology of the virus. As previously suggested for bovine coronavirus (Hogue et al., 1984) , the possibility of a human infection by TCV cannot be excluded.",
