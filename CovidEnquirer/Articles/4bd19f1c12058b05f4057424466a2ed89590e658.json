Therefore, in treatment, Western medicine focuses on elimination of the specific pathological factors, but TCM tends to concentrate on restoring human functional balance.",

In Su Wen ( Plain Questions), a famous ancient Chinese medical text, infectious diseases are described. After thousands years of clinical practice and theory, many methods and prescriptions have been developed to treat infectious diseases. The first AIDS case in China was reported in 1985, and many TCM workers began to consider how to treat HIV/AIDS with TCM. Since September 1988, TCM experts have been sent by the China State Administration of Tradition Chinese Medicine to Tanzania to treat AIDS patients, and have observed the therapeutic effect of TCM and considered which Traditional Chinese Medicines might be effective. Meanwhile, basic experimental studies have also been conducted to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of these TCM agents. Currently, the cooperation is continuing and a lot of practical experience is being accumulated. In the past 30 years, the pathogenic factors and pathogenesis of AIDS have been proposed based on TCM theory, and the syndrome pattern and a number of formulae have been developed in clinical practice. Furthermore, more clinical trials and basic experiments have been carried out and have proven the efficacy of TCM intervention in AIDS.",

INRs are at increased risk of HIV/AIDS progress and death. 10 Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7 and regulatory T cells have been used for intervention in INRs, but have not been widely adopted clinically as yet, because of unproven safety and efficacy.

This is in accordance with the defense, homeostasis and surveillance of the immune system in Western medicine. Here, the vital qi refers to the normal immune function of the human body. Many therapeutic methods of TCM have been developed to treat immune deficiency diseases, 14 such as supplementing and invigorating vital qi, reinforcing and strengthening the kidneys, promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, and clearing away heat and toxic materials. In HIV/AIDS, HIV as evil qi during the entire disease course gradually weakens the vital qi. However, the vital qi can be regulated or strengthened to normal levels with appropriate TCM therapy based on the patients' different signs and symptoms. The vital qi dispels HIV and promotes restoration of immune function. Therefore, in INRs, TCM can be used together with HAART to improve the immunological response and induce reconstitution of the CD4 + T-cell compartment.",

            "text": "At present, HIV/AIDS patients are increasingly seeking help from TCM. In 2002, it was reported that 18.6% of HIV/AIDS adults in the United States were treated with herbal medicines. 27 A study conducted in Hong Kong revealed that 59.2% of HIV/AIDS patients had used TCM, with 20% infrequently and 60% frequently. 28 The popularity of TCM has led many people to wonder whether it is beneficial to human health. Although many studies have shown the efficacy of TCM for preventing and treating AIDS, few of these studies were strictly designed and their evidence is not sufficiently strong. Furthermore, Ma, et al. 28 have demonstrated that the main indications of TCM are for general health maintenance and/or treatment of minor illness, rather than specifically for HIV/AIDS. Also, some people have questioned whether there is any antagonism between Chinese herbs and antiretroviral drugs. To resolve these problems, first, future studies should be more strictly designed and randomized clinical trials with specific assessment criteria of therapeutic effects for TCM should be used to provide conclusive evidence of the efficacy of TCM intervention in AIDS. Second, studies should focus on the areas in which TCM could work well in HIV/AIDS treatment. Last, further rigorous basic studies should be designed to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between medicinal herbs and antiretroviral drugs. We conclude that TCM is an effective HIV/AIDS treatment option and will play an important role in future treatment.",

Another study 18 has shown that Yi Ai Kang Capsules ( ), consisting of Ren Shen (Radix Ginseng), Huang Qi (Radix Astragali), Chao Bai Zhu (Fried Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae), Fu Ling (Poria), and other components, are effective in preventing further decline in CD4 cells and delaying disease progression. Almost all studies have shown that TCM can delay disease progression by preserving immune function. Therefore, TCM can be considered as a therapy for patients with asymptomatic HIV infection.",
