            "text": "Physiological cholesterol metabolism implies the generation of a series of oxidized derivatives, whose oxysterols are by far the most investigated ones for their potential multifaceted involvement in human pathophysiology. In this regard, noteworthy is the broad antiviral activity displayed by defined side chain oxysterols, in particular 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC). Although their antiviral mechanism(s) may vary depending on virus/host interaction, these oxysterols share the common feature to hamper viral replication by interacting with cellular proteins. Here reported is the first analysis of the modulation of a cell proteome by these two oxysterols, that, besides yielding additional clues about their potential involvement in the regulation of sterol metabolism, provides novelinsights about the mechanism underlying the inhibition of virus entry and trafficking within infected cells. We show here that both 25HC and 27HC can down-regulate the junction adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and the cation independent isoform of mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPRci), two crucial molecules for the replication of all those viruses that exploit adhesion molecules and the endosomal pathway to enter and diffuse within target cells.",

            "text": "Over the last few years solid evidence has been provided of a remarkable antiviral effect of defined oxysterols, essentially of enzymatic origin [1] [2] [3] . These cholesterol derived molecules proved to be effective in inhibiting the replication of a wide span of viral pathogens, characterised by highly divergent replicative strategies and structural features. In this relation, the most studied member of this family has certainly been 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a physiological oxysterol whose production by the enzyme 25-cholesterol hydroxylase was proven to be interferon-inducible [1, 2] . Moreover, a similarly strong inhibition of the replication of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses was demonstrated to be exerted as well by 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) [4] [5] [6] , the product of the ubiquitous mitochondrial enzyme 27-cholesterol hydroxylase [7] and by far the most represented oxysterol in human plasma [8] . This unprecedented antiviral spectrum relies at least in part on the ability of oxysterols to modify the composition of cellular and subcellular membranes that all viral pathogens have to cross in order to enter the host cells or hijack their replicative machinery. These oxysterol-induced modifications can be triggered by different mechanisms such as (A) the direct interaction of oxysterols with cellular membranes, (B) the interaction with cellular proteins involved in cholesterol shuttling between intracellular membranes [such as the oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP)]], (C) the modulation of the expression of enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism, by binding specific nuclear receptors such as the liver X receptor [LXR] and the estrogen receptor \u03b1 [ER \u03b1] cells under viral attack, for instance through a redox-dependent upregulation of NF-kB-driven overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6 [4] .",

Peptides were separated using a 90 min linear gradient (from 1% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid to 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and on-line electrosprayed into an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source (both Thermo). The mass spectrometer operated in data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode, controlled by the software Xcalibur (version 2.0.7, Thermo) to acquire both full MS spectra in the m/z range 320-1400 (resolution 1 \u00d7 10 5 FWHM at m/z 400) and MS/MS spectra obtained by collision induced dissociation [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] (CID) of the 6 most abundant multi-charged ions. Automatic gain control (AUG) was set at 1 \u00d7 10 6 for the acquisition of full MS spectra and at 1 \u00d7 10 5 for MS/MS spectra. To avoid redundancy, after two subsequent occurrences in less than 30 s, precursor ions already selected for fragmentation were dynamically excluded for 45 s.",

The NF-kB-dependent induction of inflammatory cytokines synthesis would then contribute to counteract cell invasion by viral particles [26] [27] [28] and the recognized pro-inflammatory properties of oxysterols [29, 30] could potentiate the cytokine production provoked by the virus, as actually demonstrated in cells infected with Herpes Simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) [4] .

For instance, both investigated oxysterols strongly down-regulated cellular levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase, the key regulatory enzyme of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. This is consistent with previous literature, showing that 25-HC is a HMG-CoA reductase and synthase inhibitor [31] and, by means of this mechanism, it conveys an antiviral state in treated cells, particularly against flaviviruses, including hepatitits C virus [32] . Moreover, both oxysterols can downregulate the expression of isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase 1, a crucial regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of isoprenoids. Interestingly, an excessive protein isoprenylation is correlated to cardiovascular and age-related disease [33] , while the two oxysterols would act as quenchers of isoprenoids' synthesis.",

It was very recently demonstrated that most rotavirus strains need the Golgi-LEs transporters MPRci and Sortilin-1 and their cargo cathepsins to efficiently infect Caco-2 and MA104 cells [37] . In this relation, both 25HC and 27HC proved to markedly inhibit rotavirus replication in the same cell lines [5, 6] . In the report of Diaz-Salinas and colleagues [37] , at least cathepsins B, L and S were involved in the Golgi-LE traffic modulated by MPRci. SILAC experiments showed a significant downregulation of cathepsin D only in HeLa cells treated with 25HC and not with 27HC (Supplementary Material, Table S2 ). It cannot be excluded that also this isoform could contribute to the infectivity of at least defined rotavirus strains. More importantly, MPR appears to be pivotal for the replication of several other viruses. Vaccinia virus protein p37 localizes to the LE and interacts with proteins associated with LE-derived transport vesicle biogenesis such as MPR to facilitate assembly of extracellular forms of virus [38] . The HSV glycoprotein D (gD), which is essential for this virus to enter cells, can efficiently bind to MPRci, an interaction that plays a role in virus entry and egress [39] . In a recent study, Dohgu and colleagues showed that the MPR is involved in both the replicative cycle and the dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), facilitating the passing of HIV-1 through the blood brain barrier [40] .",

However, an actual coinvolvement of oxysterol-induced deficit of cell MPRci in the protective effect of 25HC and 27HC against rotavirus infection [5, 6] could be reinforced by the evidence that defined rotavirus strains, including the human ones, utilize the tight junction protein JAM-A as a co-receptor to enter enterocyte cells [42] . Solid proofs are actually available indicating that several virus families exploit various tight junction proteins to enter, replicate or even exit the target cells, being JAM-A used by reovirus and rotavirus to facilitate the infection process [43] . Of note, JAM-A and MPRci have a different localization in the cell, being the first bounded to the plasma membrane and the second to cytoplasmic membranes. Hence, the tight junction protein appears the first and critical target of viruses, then reaching LE in a second step to enter into the cytosol from those vesicles.",

The two oxysterols were shown by our group to further up-regulate the redox sensitive transcription factor NF-kB in virus infected cells, by this way boosting the cellular pro-inflammatory reaction against the virus itself [4] . In addition, we previously reported that the survival signalling triggered by low micromolar concentrations of 27HC in the human pro-monocytyc U-937 cell line was dependent on a rapid and transient activation of NADPH-oxidase with consequent H 2 O 2 production [44, 45] . These findings are thus indicating a promising way to deeper elucidate the actual contribution of redox reactions in the antiviral effects of 25HC and 27HC.",
