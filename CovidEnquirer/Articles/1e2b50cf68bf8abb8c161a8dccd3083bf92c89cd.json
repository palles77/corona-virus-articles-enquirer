The concept of HAI extends also to infections acquired by health-care workers as a result of their work within the health-care system.",

            "text": "HAI have a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality. They prolong the duration of hospital stay, require additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, and generate added costs to those already incurred by the patients' underlying diseases. Furthermore, hospitals are notorious as a source for the emergence, selection, and spread of multiresistant bacteria that can cause severe clinical syndromes that are difficult and expensive to treat and may even become virtually incurable. Health-care settings also act as a reservoir for the dissemination of resistant organisms to the community and may, in some cases, become the epicentre for the spread of emerging epidemic agents, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or ebolavirus. Some of these conditions would certainly have led to \"complete isolation\" in times when quarantine hospitals and even quarantine islands were frequent (figure 1). The occurrence of HAIs is detrimental both to the patient and health-care workers and, consequently, HAI rates are considered an indicator of the quality of care. Although HAI may occur as an adverse event potentially expected from the more advanced and sophisticated care techniques of modern medicine, it is also evident that frequently they represent a failure in health-care performance and therefore are considered a patient safety issue.",

            "text": "Given the wide range of pathogens and different healthcare settings involved, reliable, standardised figures on HAI at national and international levels are extremely difficult to obtain. National surveys undertaken in different European countries during the past 20 years have reported overall HAI prevalence rates in hospitals ranging from 3\u00b75% to 14\u00b78%. 2-13 About 2-3 million people are estimated to be affected by HAIs in Europe annually with a corresponding economic burden of \u20ac800 million. 14, 15 Available data are insufficient to allow an estimate of HAIrelated mortality for the entire European region, but HAI attributable deaths are estimated at around 5000 annually in the UK 16 and France. 17 These figures could be even higher if the burden of infections occurring in patients admitted to health-care facilities with a lower awareness of the need for HAI surveillance activities, infection prevention, and control interventions (eg, long-term care facilities, private clinics, nursing homes) is taken into consideration. Health-care-associated infection (HAI) is a major issue of patient safety with a substantial impact on morbidity, mortality, and use of additional resources worldwide. In April 2004, the WHO Regional Office for Europe organised the first international consultation to address the issue of HAI in eastern and central Europe. The main objectives of the consultation were to identify the primary needs and obstacles for the prevention and control of HAI at country level, to design the essential components of an international strategy to effectively address the issue of HAI, and to identify specific priorities and recommendations for interventions by the WHO and other international institutions. An update on HAI activities and related networks throughout Europe, together with the outcome of the meeting, are presented, with special emphasis on future considerations for a European WHO strategy on HAI prevention. The Lazzaretto Vecchio, the first isolation institution worldwide, was established on the island of Saint Mary of Nazareth (later renamed Lazzaretto Nuovo) in Venice in 1423 to limit the spread of plague (from which the name \"Lazzaretto\" originated). In 1468, the Venetian Senate designated Lazzaretto Nuovo as a quarantine island and huge warehouses were erected to store merchandise arriving in Venice from suspect areas with merchants and sailors quartered alongside.

            "text": "For many years, HAI has been considered primarily to be a clinical care and hospital management issue, and has only recently been recognised as a global public-health problem. As a result, the international community and the WHO have addressed the problem only in a limited and fragmented manner. Some guidelines and documents are available but they are limited in scope, and in the extent to which they offer tools for national programme managers. They have not been widely translated from their original languages, distributed to other countries and interested parties, nor have they been implemented. A recent inventory of activities and documents related to HAI available at the WHO headquarters and the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO EURO) is summarised in web appendix 1 (http://image.thelancet.com/extras/ 05ID10006webappendix1.pdf). Among these initiatives, there are some successful examples of programmes related to infection prevention and control, such as the blood and injection safety programmes. However, there is currently no established group or specific programme committed to comprehensively address the problem of HAI at either global or regional levels. Recent events, particularly lessons learned from the SARS epidemic, which had a major nosocomial component, have shown that it is now urgent to bring the HAI issue to the forefront of infection control. Based on these premises, WHO EURO, in collaboration with the International Health and Social Affairs Office of the Veneto Region, Italy, the Department of Infectious Diseases of the University of Verona, Italy, and several departments in WHO headquarters, organised an international consultation to address the issue of HAI in eastern and central Europe.",

As a network, HELICS has not yet addressed the reporting of special events such as epidemics, emerging pathogens, and environmental threats. These shortcomings are to be addressed in a follow-up project. The HELICS philosophy is based on the following essential points: the need for legislation making surveillance recommended and/or compulsory through an accreditation process; the choice of meaningful indicators of HAI adjusted for patient characteristics and level of exposure to invasive procedures, and linked to feasible prevention actions; and the identification of a minimum data set, possibly collected through a computerised data management system. A key aspect of the HELICS philosophy is to support the creation of national surveillance networks. Consequently, individual hospitals can only participate through their national network, except under certain circumstances (eg, for piloting if a national network is not available).",

By linking national networks, it aims to maintain a comprehensive surveillance and information system providing comparable and validated data on the prevalence and spread of major invasive bacteria with clinically and epidemiologically relevant antimicrobial resistance. The goal of EARSS is neither to produce crude data, nor to classify countries in a league table, but rather to provide a partnership and a forum for exchange of experiences to stimulate the implementation of national networks. Samples are collected at community and hospital level and the resistance patterns of five major pathogens-Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis-are detected according to international standardised methods and summarised in widely available datasets and figures. Variations in antimicrobial resistance in clinical specimens over time and location are monitored, and used for policy decisions and the assessment of effectiveness of intervention. Figure 4 illustrates a possible use of the tools of this network to map the prevalence of meticillin resistance among S aureus across European countries.",

Another important working group is the ESCMID Study Group for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (ESGARS; http://www.escmid.org/sites/index_f.asp?par=2.5.0&Ref =366), which recently produced a comprehensive and very useful document containing the European recommendations for antimicrobial-resistance surveillance. 29 An interesting, EU-funded research project of ESCMID, Antibiotic Resistance Prevention And Control (ARPAC; http://www.abdn.ac.uk/arpac/main-escmid.htm), investigated the state of infection control programmes in 167 European hospitals in 2001 using a questionnaire. 30 The results showed important differences and inequalities between EU countries in infection control practices (eg, use of alcohol-based handrubs for hand hygiene) and infrastructure (eg, availability of single rooms), and a general lack of auditing and feedback activities to monitor the impact of surveillance and interventions. Finally, the EU has launched a research project, HARMONY (Harmonisation of Antibiotic Resistance measurement, Methods of typing Organisms and ways of using these and other tools to increase the effectiveness of Nosocomial infection control), with the major objective to promote a closer and more productive collaboration with ESCMID. Through this initiative, the efforts of all participating institutions are united to produce harmonised and validated tools that will assist field professionals in dealing with three major issues: antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring, microbial typing, and infection prevention and control.",

As a result, very few consistent data on HAI are obtained and used to generate interventions. To build reliable and efficient HAI surveillance models, the following needs were identified: international standardised case definitions-in particular, the heterogeneity of underlying diagnostic procedures; guidelines to correctly perform surveillance studies and to analyse and translate results into practice; and reference laboratories for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and typing accredited by a quality assurance system. Specific educational activities on surveillance methods and use of surveillance data are urgently required; multistep internet modules have been suggested as an innovative, widely accessible, potentially time-sparing option. To ensure that surveillance activities have an impact on infection prevention and control strategies, it is crucial to develop valid processes and outcome indicators and to use them to interact with quality management and patient safety groups. Appropriate ways of ensuring that data collected by surveillance activities are correctly interpreted and made regularly available to the public, patients (and their advocates), national health insurance schemes, and hospital managers, should also be sought.",
