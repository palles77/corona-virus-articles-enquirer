            "text": "Innate viral inhibitors that are broadly active have been characterized in the serum and the nervous system, but incompletely characterized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI preparations from porcine gastric mucosa, mouse intestine, and in neuramide (a pharmaceutical product), were examined for broad antiviral activity, molecular size and mechanism of action for comparison with the previously characterized, innate inhibitors in the serum and nervous system. The GI inhibitors were found to be active in high titers against RNA and DNA viruses, resistant to proteolysis, glycolysis, lipid extraction and possessed differing mechanisms of action. The mouse intestinal inhibitor prevented virus attachment to cells, and neuramide acted at an early post-attachment stage of virus multiplication. The porcine mucosal inhibitor acted as late as 6 h after initiation of the multiplication cycle. These broadly active GI inhibitors differed from the previously described serum inhibitor (UTIb) high density lipoproteins (HDL) and the nervous system (NS) inhibitor by being smaller (600 9 400 kDa) and resistant to proteinase K, glycosidases and organic solvents. The mouse intestinal inhibitor acts similarly to UTIb and NS inhibitor by preventing attachment of virus to the cells. In comparison, the neuramide and the porcine mucosal inhibitor, like HDL, acted after attachment to the target cells. The innate nonspecific, broadly-active virus inhibitors, based on high titers and location, are considered important initial immune defense mechanisms against viral infections and thus potentially useful in medical applications.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the properties of the broadly active inhibitors associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including size, structure, active chemical moiety and mechanisms of action. Other broadly active viral inhibitors have been reported in certain body tissues and fluids (Singh et al., 1992 (Singh et al., , 1995 (Singh et al., , 1999 . The other inhibitors include high-density lipoprotein in plasma (Singh et al., 1999) , UTIB in plasma (Singh et al., 1992) and NS inhibitor, which is distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems (Singh et al., 1995) . These other inhibitors are distinct from the present GI inhibitor as determined by their properties and mechanisms of antiviral action. These findings with the GI inhibitors are compared to the properties of the other innate inhibitors that were reported previously in various body tissues and fluids.",

The preparations were vortexed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2000 rev./min for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15 000 rev./min for 20 min and filtered through 0.45-and 0.22-mm Corning 50-ml filters. The filtrate was aliquoted in 5-ml amounts and stored at \u2212 20\u00b0C until use. The two preparations had equal antiviral activity. The eluate from the minced and washed preparation was used for characterization. Thus for these initial characterization studies, centrifuged and filtered inhibitor preparations were used to initially establish their major properties.

Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells, American Type Culture Collection, CCL 81) were used for assaying the inhibitors. The antiviral activity was expressed as units per ml. One unit (U) was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of inhibitor preparation showing 50% inhibition of 30-40 plaque-forming units (PFU) used for challenge. All assays included at least two replicates and results were confirmed in repeated experiments. Neuramide was used as a positive virus inhibitor control in each assay.",

Briefly, the periodate oxidation was achieved by adding 0.35 M NaIO 4 to the inhibitor sample (pH 7.5) and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The sample was dialyzed against a 100 molecular weight cut off (MWCO membrane) to remove NaIO 4 and assayed for antiviral MWCO membrane activity. Control experiments showed that IO 4 , although slightly larger than 100 Dalton, did pass through the membrane entirely, presumably due to a tolerance range that included IO 4 . Deglycosylation was performed by a modified technique of Bose et al. (1976) (Singh et al., 1992) by treating the inhibitor with a mixture of carbohydrases, consisting of a-galactosidase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN); b-Nacetylglucosaminidase (Sigma, St Louis, MO); endoglycosidase (Sigma); neuraminidase (Sigma); and b-mannosidase (Sigma). The inhibitor sample preadjusted to pH 6.0 was mixed with 100 ml of the glycosidase mixture and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a rotary shaker for 24 h. To it was then added a sulfhydryl reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), in a final concentration of 0.1 M, and the mixture was further incubated for 6 h. We modified the procedure by omitting DTT for the mouse intestinal inhibitor, since at this point we had found the small size of this inhibitor and unfolding of small molecule is not required for penetration by glycosidases. Samples containing DDT were dialyzed to remove the DTT and assayed for residual antiviral activity (Singh et al., 1992 (Singh et al., , 1995 .",

The rationale for the temperature experiment is that at 4\u00b0C the cell membrane is physiologically inert, and hence virus replication should not proceed beyond initial attachment to the target cell. Comparable titers at 4 and 37\u00b0C, therefore, imply that an antiviral substance inhibits the attachment of virus to target cells. Significantly higher titers at 37 than at 4\u00b0C imply that the inhibitor acts at a post-attachment stage. Table 3 shows that the titers of neuramide and porcine mucosal inhibitors against SBV, VSV and MV at 4\u00b0C were significantly lower than those assayed at 37\u00b0C. This indicates that neuramide and porcine mucosal inhibitors may act by blocking viral replication at a post-attachment stage. The mouse intestine inhibitor, on the other hand, is active at 4\u00b0C, and, therefore, inhibits virus replication by preventing attachment of virions to the target cells.",

Neuramide was adjusted to pH 7.3 and to isotonicity by dialysis with balanced salt solution so that Neuramide would be in the same suspending medium as the other preparations. synchronous infection. Virus titers were measured after a single growth cycle (8 h) to avoid possible complications stemming from suppression of subsequent growth cycles by residual inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 1 , when the inhibitor preparations were added at 0 h and left in the culture, they reduced the yield of SBV by 98 -99%. When the inhibitors were added 1 -6 h later, only the porcine mucosal inhibitor reduced the yield of SBV. Thus, the porcine mucosal inhibitor caused the inhibition of virus replication after attachment of the virus to the cell for as long as 6 h after initiation of the growth cycle. In comparison, in the presence of the mouse intestine inhibitor and the neuramide, this inhibition occurred only at 0 h, indicating inhibition either during attachment (intestinal inhibitor) or early post-attachment (neuramide).

            "text": "The antiviral activities of innate inhibitors against individual or families of viruses are reported to reside in a variety of uncharacterized or partly characterized substances. Most are distinguishable from antibody, interferon, and complement. Many of the antiviral substances have generally been reported to act against single viruses, such as some coronaviruses, Newcastle disease virus, variola virus, Sendai virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (Karzon, 1956; Kitamura et al., 1973; Thiry et al., 1978; Sinibaldi et al., 1979; Gerna et al., 1980) . Some are active against individual virus families, including myxoviruses, togaviruses, and retroviruses (Krizanova and Rathova, 1969; Shortridge and Ho, 1974; Welsh et al., 1976) . The mechanisms of action of these viral inhibitors, when known, vary. Some of these act by irreversible neutralization of infectiv-ity, as in the case with coronavirus and Sendai virus inhibitors (Karzon, 1956; Kitamura et al., 1973; Sinibaldi et al., 1979; Gerna et al., 1980) . The myxoand togavirus inhibitors appear to prevent hemaglutination but not infectivity (Krizanova and Rathova, 1969; Shortridge and Ho, 1974) . The inhibitor of vesicular stomatitis virus acts by penetration of the viral envelope and inactivation of viral RNA (Thiry et al., 1978) . The retrovirus inhibitor works via complement-mediated lysis of the virally infected cells (Welsh et al., 1976) .",

Interestingly, elution or secretion of a distinct viral inhibitor into extracellular fluids has been reported for nervous tissue (Baron et al., 1998 ), but has not been found using kidney and liver. To definitely assign defensive roles, future studies should show that (1) administration of these inhibitors is protective in vivo and (2) deletion of the inhibitors enhances infections.",

            "text": "The present characterization of GI inhibitors allows comparison of properties of all the broadly-active antiviral innate substances reported in body fluids and tissues (Baron et al., 1986 (Baron et al., , 1987 (Baron et al., , 1989 Kumar et al., 1984; Singh et al., 1992 Singh et al., , 1995 Singh et al., , 1999 (Table 4 ). As shown in the first column of Table 4 , broadly active antiviral substances are present in the plasma, nervous system, and GI tract. However, they differ in size, chemi- cal structure, and mechanism of action. As shown in the third column, the GI inhibitors are relatively small (0.6 kDa) compared to the large molecular complexes in plasma (60 and 500 kDa) and the nervous system (4000 kDa). Interestingly, the 60 kDa molecular weight inhibitor in the plasma (UTIb) and the 4000 kDa inhibitor in the nervous system (NS) can be broken down into active smaller size inhibitors (5 1 kDa) similar in size to the GI inhibitors (Baron et al., 1998; Singh et al., 1992 Singh et al., , 1995 . In addition, both small peptides and apolipoprotein A-1 from the HDL retain some antiviral activity (Srinivas et al., 1990) . Thus, smaller molecular components of the larger inhibitors appear to be inhibitory. The viral inhibitory assays indicate that all, except HDL, occur in high titers, starting at at least 25 U/ml or g (column 4). These high titers are in the same range as interferon which is an established host defense. The GI inhibitors which have the lowest molecular weight (600 Da) (columns 3), are resistant to lipid extraction, proteolytic and glycolytic enzymatic digestion (columns 5 and 6). On the other hand, the NS inhibitor is a large molecule of 4000 kDa and is inactivated by proteinase and glycosidases. HDL has a molecular size of 500 kDa and a peptide structure appears to be responsible for its antiviral activity. UTIb is a glycoprotein of 60 kDa with carbohydrate as the antiviral moiety. The mechanism of action (column 7) of the mouse intestinal inhibitor, UTIb, and the NS inhibitor occurs at the virus stage of attachment. The HDL inhibition is at the stage of virus penetration. Neuramide acts in the early post-attachment phase, and the porcine gastric mucosal preparation acts during the late post-attachment phase.",
