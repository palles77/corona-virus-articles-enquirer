However, the development of systemically delivered antisense therapeutics has been hampered by poor tissue penetration and cellular uptake, including crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach targets in the central nervous system (CNS). For SMA application, we have investigated the ability of various BBB-crossing peptides for CNS delivery of a splice-switching phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) targeting survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) exon 7 inclusion. We identified a branched derivative of the well-known ApoE (141-150) peptide, which as a PMO conjugate was capable of exon inclusion in the CNS following systemic administration, leading to an increase in the level of full-length SMN2 transcript. Treatment of newborn SMA mice with this peptide-PMO (P-PMO) conjugate resulted in a significant increase in the average lifespan and gains in weight, muscle strength, and righting reflexes. Systemic treatment of adult SMA mice with this newly identified P-PMO also resulted in small but significant increases in the levels of SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) exon inclusion in the CNS and peripheral tissues. This work provides proof of principle for the ability to select new peptide paradigms to enhance CNS delivery and activity of a PMO SSO through use of a peptide-based delivery platform for the treatment of SMA potentially extending to other neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "S pinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease and a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. It is characterized by the loss of lower motor neurons, which results in progressive atrophy of voluntary muscle groups leading to paralysis and eventually premature death [1] . It is caused by the deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene in more than 95% of SMA patients [2] . Humans have a second nearly identical copy of this gene, SMN2 [2] . The majority (*90%) of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 due to a translationally silent C-to-T transition +6 nucleotides within exon 7 [2] [3] [4] . Skipping of exon 7 during pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing leads to the production of a truncated and only marginally functional SMN protein product [5] . The 10% of SMN2 transcripts that contain exon 7 and which produce full-length functional SMN protein cannot adequately compensate for the loss of SMN1 unless high copy numbers of SMN2 are present, in which case the severity of the disease is reduced [6, 7] . Therefore, the focus of most current therapeutic strategies is to increase the expression of SMN protein by induction of exon 7 inclusion in SMN2.",

For the treatment of SMA, an SSO is being developed by Ionis/Biogen Pharmaceuticals for use in infants and children, which has progressed to phase III clinical trials after promising data from open-label phase II studies and this drug, called Nusinersen, is expected to be approved soon for clinical use [10] . However, this type of SSO is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the target motor neurons in central nervous system (CNS), hence the need for delivery through intrathecal injection to obtain broad CNS distribution. In a recent study on intrathecal administration of Nusinersen (ISIS-SMNRx), it was reported that, despite its great effectiveness, 32% of patients have developed side effects such as headache, back pain, and postlumbar puncture syndromes [11] , possibly due to the use of an intrathecal delivery technique. There is thus a strong impetus to explore the development of noninvasive and efficient delivery systems for therapeutic SSOs to enter brain and spinal cord through the circulation.",

Despite the transduction efficiency of viral gene delivery, the use of viral delivery vehicles is limited due to the immunotoxicity of the viral coat protein and potential oncogenic effects [12] . However, in the case of neuromuscular diseases, considerable progress has been made in the use of nonviral delivery vectors, particularly synthetic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). In the case of DMD, conjugations of various Arg-rich peptides to exon skipping PMOs have given rise to dramatic improvements in levels of in vivo dystrophin production in skeletal muscles in mouse models [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , and we have extended this to heart muscles using a new range of such peptides known as Pip [18, 19] . In very recent studies in SMA mouse models, we have found that a conjugate of PMO to Pip6a peptide, following intravenous delivery, was able to direct significant exon inclusion in the brains and spinal cords of SMA model mice in addition to skeletal muscles [20] .",

Thus, in parallel to our recent study of the Arg-rich Pip6a peptide as a PMO carrier into brain and spinal cord of an SMA mouse, we asked whether it was possible to identify other peptide types capable of simultaneously enhancing muscle cell penetration of a PMO bio-cargo into skeletal muscle tissue as well as delivering a splice-switching PMO into the CNS of SMA mice. Thus, we screened and tested two main types of alternative peptide-PMO (P-PMO) conjugates, in one case where the peptide component might be expected to utilize a receptor-mediated BBB transcytosis mechanism as well as in the other case some cationic P-PMOs that might be subject to absorptive-mediated BBB transcytosis similar to Pip6a.",

Thus, we first used a two-stage cellular spliceswitching screen to gauge the cell uptake efficiency and the pre-mRNA targeting ability of these conjugates. Preliminary screening for muscle cell penetration was carried out using the well-established exon-skipping assay in the DMD mouse mdx muscle cell line that has a high dynamic range. A secondstage testing then involved induction of SMN2 exon 7 inclusion in a human SMA patient-derived fibroblast cell line. Several of the most cell-active peptides that passed both these screens were then tested as PMO conjugates in a newborn mouse model of SMA carrying a human SMN2 transgene, by measurement of the level of exon 7 inclusion after intravenous injection at postnatal day 4 (PND4). This led to the identification of a branched ApoE (K/A) peptide candidate, which as a PMO conjugate was demonstrated to show a dramatic improvement in the lifespan of homozygous newborn SMA mice with median lifespan *15 days [28] to 78 days and two SMA mice surviving to 280-290 days. The ability of this branched peptide in delivery of exon-including PMO into the CNS was then also evaluated in adult SMA mice through intravenous administration and we showed that it is able to deliver PMO into the CNS and restore full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA.",

Peptides were precipitated in ice-cold diethyl ether and the peptide pellets were washed three times in ice-cold diethyl ether. PepC7 and branched (Br) PepC7 peptides were further modified postsynthesis by formation of a disulfide bond. The first disulfide bond was easily formed by oxidizing the cysteine residues by first dissolving the linear peptide in 0.1 M NH 4 HCO 3 solution (1 mg/3 mL, pH 8) followed by addition of a 1 mM solution of 2,2\u00a2dipyridyldisulfide (DPDS) in methanol (0.2 mL/1 mg). Since there was no change in the retention time of the oxidized peptide, the formation of a disulfide bond was confirmed by the Ellman's test [29] . The formation of the second disulfide bond was carried out by simultaneous removal of Acm-protecting groups and oxidation of cysteines. Br-PepC7 was dissolved in acetic acid (2 mg/mL) and 60 mM HCl solution (5% v/v) was added followed by addition of iodine (10 eq/Acm) as a 20 mM solution. The progress of the reaction was monitored using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Due to the slow rate of oxidation, the amount of iodine was increased to 20 eq/Acm group. Following the completion of the reaction after 30 min, the peptide was precipitated in cold diethyl ether. The peptide pellet was dissolved in water and 20 mM ascorbic acid solution was added to quench the remaining traces of iodine. All peptides were purified (>90%) using preparative RP-HPLC on a Phenomenex column (21.2 \u00b7 150 mm, C18, 5 mm) using a 0.1% TFA-based buffer.

Peptides were dissolved in NMP to a concentration of 50 mM and the PMO was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 10 mM. A 2.5-fold excess of peptide over PMO was used. The peptides were activated using HBTU:HOBt (2.5:2) and con-jugated to the PMO in the presence of a fourfold excess of DIEA. The reaction was carried out at 40\u00b0C for 2 h.

In addition, we synthesized other peptides that were identified from phage display screens [PepC7 [43] and TGN [44] , a peptide derived from the HSV glycoprotein (gH625) [45] , a Protegrin peptide, SYNB3 [46] , a hydrophobic peptide PFV [47] , and a hybrid Protegrin-hydrophobic peptide (SynB3PFV)]. Some of these peptides are also highly cationic and might be expected to use an absorptive-mediated transcyotosis pathway of BBB crossing as an alternative or in addition to a receptor-mediated pathway. The cationic charge should also facilitate good cell uptake. Furthermore, two of these peptides were synthesized as double versions, either as linear tandem peptides (tandem ApoE) or branched (Br) peptides by branching through a Lys residue at the C-terminus [Br-ApoE and Br-PepC7 as well as a mutant Br-ApoE (K/A)]. All peptides were synthesized as C-terminal carboxylic acids and furnished with a bis-homopropargylglycine (Bpg) residue to enable ''click'' conjugation to a fluorescent label [31] . They were purified to >95% using RP-HPLC (eg, see Supplementary Fig. S1 [Supplementary Data are available online at www .liebertpub.com/nat] for purification of branched PepC7).

First, we conjugated the peptides to a wellvalidated 25-mer Dmd PMO sequence and measured spliceswitching activity in differentiated H2K skeletal muscle mdx cells through measurement of the levels of DMD exon-23 skipping [19, [48] [49] [50] [51] . This cell assay has a very high dynamic range and is thus a good primary screen for general cell delivery and RNA-targeting ability. All P-PMO conjugates showed a concentration-dependent increase in exon-23 skipping (Fig. 1A-C) . Among the P-PMOs designed for BBB receptor targeting, ApoE (141-150)-PMO conjugate showed the highest exon-skipping activity in mdx cells that was statistically greater than that for PMO alone (Fig. 1A) . In the cases of P-PMOs, where the peptide component has an unknown mode of BBB crossing, SynB3-PMO, SynB3-PFV-PMO, and PepC7-PMO showed exon-23 skipping activity in mdx cells higher than that of the naked PMO (Fig. 1B) . The branched and linear dimers of ApoE showed significantly higher activity at lower concentrations than for the monomeric ApoE (141-150)-PMO (Fig. 1C) , whereas PMO conjugates of a dimer of PepC7 and the chimera of ApoE-PepC7 did not improve exon skipping activity of single P-PMOs (Fig. 1C) . The modified branched construct Br-ApoE-PMO (K/A) was equally active in exon skipping as its unmodified counterpart at 500 nM, but at 1 mM it was less active than its counterpart (Fig. 1C) . In the case of the tandem ApoE-PMO and the branched Br-ApoE (K/A)-PMO conjugates as a check on serum stability, exon skipping was also assessed after treatment of the conjugates with 50% mouse serum. Exon skipping levels decreased significantly for both P-PMOs after 1 h of serum treatment, but the level remained unaltered after 2 h treatment (Fig. 1D) , which demonstrated that although the peptides are prone to proteolysis in serum, a reasonable level of splice-switching activity was nevertheless maintained.",

Although the dynamic range of this cell assay is not as large as for the DMD mdx muscle cells, all P-PMO conjugates tested showed concentration-dependent increases in the levels of full-length SMN2 mRNA in the fibroblast cell assay (Fig. 3) . Whereas untreated cells showed a level of fulllength SMN2 pre-mRNA of ca. 65%, SSO-treated cells showed increases up to 85% with the concentrations used.

We chose a neonatal SMA mouse model that allows for screening of a larger number of P-PMOs than is the case for adult mice and at a lower dose, which, therefore, reduces the synthesis requirement. Thus, neonatal SMA mice (Smn1 tm1Hung/wt ; SMN2 tg/tg and Smn1 wt/wt ;SMN2 tg/tg ) [33] at PND4 were treated with P-PMO conjugates (2.66 nmol, two doses at 10 mg/kg). PND4 is the most developed stage in which a pup can be treated by facial vein administration. The effect of the P-PMOs on the increase of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA was determined by measurement of the changes in the levels of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA relative to total SMN2 transcripts 7 days after treatment by quantitative PCR (qPCR; Fig. 4A ). Among the P-PMOs tested, Br-ApoE (K/A) was the only conjugate which displayed SMN2 exon 7 inclusion activity in all three organs tested, that is, brain, kidney, and quadriceps, whereas the levels of SMN2 exon 7 inclusion activity for other P-PMO conjugates were not statistically significant compared with the saline and naked PMO-treated groups. The level of full-length SMN2 pre-mRNA in the brain measured for Br-ApoE (K/A)-PMO (1.35 -0.11, n = 5) was higher than that for saline-treated (1 -0.05, n = 4) and naked PMO-treated mice (1 -0.02, n = 6). Br-ApoE (K/A)-PMO also displayed a significantly higher activity in a skeletal muscle (quadriceps) tissue (2.1 -0.21, n = 5) as well as in kidney (1.5 -0.14, n = 5) (Fig. 4B ).",

SMA mice were treated with SMA-PMO, Br-ApoE (K/A)-PMO, and Br-ApoE (K/A)-scrambled-PMO (two doses of 10 mg/ kg, 1.48 nmol) at PND0 and PND2. The Br-ApoE (K/A)scrambled-PMO-treated mice had a median survival of 14 days, which was not significantly different to that of saline-treated mice that had a median survival of 10.5 days (Fig. 5A) . The naked SMA-PMO-treated mice survived a median of 29 days. However, the Br-ApoE (K/A)-PMO treatment led to a significant increase in the median survival of the newborn SMA mice to 78 days (P < 0.0005 Log-rank Mantel-Cox; Supplementary Table S1 ). The Br-ApoE (K/ A)-PMO-treated mice also showed an increased weight gain compared with naked PMO-treated mice (Fig. 5B) . The hindlimb strength (Fig. 5C ) and righting ability (Fig. 5D) were also significantly improved from PND2 up to PND12 [34] , during which time untreated SMA mice will become progressively weaker.",

In most cases, these antisense oligonucleotides are designed to modulate the aberrant splicing of pre-mRNA in favor of producing a therapeutically relevant RNA transcript. SSOs are being developed for the treatment of various CNS diseases such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [54] , Menkes disease [55] , Huntington's disease [56] , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [57] , and SMA [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . However, poor cellular uptake and BBB permeability have been roadblocks to systemically delivered oligonucleotide clinical applications. To date, most in vivo studies of SSOs have therefore been carried out using intra-cerebral ventricular (ICV) or intrathecal injections [53] , including the 2\u00a2-Omethoxyethyl-modified SSO (Nusinersen, ISIS-SMN RX ) that is currently in clinical trials by Ionis/Biogen Pharmaceuticals that requires multiple intrathecal injections in SMA patients who are mostly infants (ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier: NCT01839656). PMO is used in several clinical and preclinical studies due to its high stability and low toxicity [63, 64] . The PMO sequence PMO20, also known as HSMN2Ex7D(-10,-29), has been previously studied by Porensky et al. [61] . Single ICV injections (27, 54 , and 81 mg) of this PMO in newborn SMND7 mice at P0 increased the levels of both full-length SMN2 RNA transcript in the brain and spinal cord as well as SMN protein and yielded an increased survival of >100 days. In a similar study, Zhou et al. [65] used the same PMO sequence [PMO20 (-10, -29)] as well as PMO18 (-10, -27) and PMO25 (-10, -34). The survival data obtained following ICV injection of PMO25 (40 mg/g) was comparable to that of PMO20 obtained by Porensky et al. In this study, the PMO was conjugated with an octa-guanidine dendrimer (vivomorpholino), which were shown previously to be effective for splice switching in DMD mice [66] . However, an ICV injection (10 mg/kg) of vivo-PMO25 designed for SMN2 exon 7 inclusion led to the death of all mice and a dose of 4 mg/kg resulted in hydrocephalus [66] . Systemic administration of vivo-PMO25 also failed to restore full-length SMN2 in the brain, demonstrating the limitations of an octaguanidine dendrimer as a PMO delivery vector into the CNS.",

Very recently, we reported the use of the CPP Pip6a for delivery of PMO into the brain or CNS from the circulation, a prerequisite for its systemic application to diseases such as SMA [20] . This current study was aimed at cellular and in vivo screening to identify other novel peptides active both in splice switching in cells (muscle and SMA patient fibroblasts) and in systemic delivery of a PMO SSO into SMA mouse models to restore SMN2 expression both in skeletal muscle as well as in the CNS. The SMA mouse pup model is particularly relevant to the disease since SMN protein is required for motor neuron development during the early postnatal stages of development [69] [70] [71] . Exon inclusion of SMN2 pre-mRNA and increase of the SMN protein level can lead to the extension of survival, which can serve as a good phenotypic readout.",

However, in subsequent cell viability evaluations (Fig. 2) , a high level of cytotoxicity was observed for these P-PMOs, perhaps due to the very high number of cationic amino acids [72] . By contrast, cytotoxicity was significantly reduced when we replaced Lys residues by Ala in [Br-ApoE (K/A)-PMO], to give a branched peptide having less positive charges, but splice-switching efficiency was still maintained. Lys residues were substituted rather than Arg due to the suggestion of more efficient cell-penetrating ability by Arg-containing cell-penetrating peptides than for Lys [73] . In line with the DMD exon-skipping results in H2K mdx cells, Br-ApoE (K/A)-PMO showed the highest spliceswitching activity in further screening in SMA type I fibroblasts for SMN2 exon 7 inclusion (Fig. 3) , which is an established SMA cell assay, but with a lower dynamic range than in the prescreen using the DMD exon-skipping assay.",

SynB3 has been shown previously to enhance the in vivo brain uptake of bio-cargoes such as dalargin [46] and PEGylated nanoparticles [74] . Note that this peptide is moderately cationic (five Arg residues) and therefore it may be acting in quadriceps like a CPP [18] . SynB3 and SynB3PFV peptides also showed very high splice-switching ability in H2K mdx muscle cells (Fig. 1B) . However, the ability of Br-ApoE (K/A) to be active both in brain and in skeletal muscle tissue gives this peptide a particular advantage for further SMA therapeutic development. The branched arrangement of this peptide also resulted in slightly more serum stability than for the tandem dimer of ApoE and may provide a better clustering of guanidinium groups of Arg to bind the negatively charged glycans on the cell surface for endocytotic uptake of the peptide [75, 76] .",

Nor has any evidence of such uptake been presented for naked PMO injected intrathecally into SMA mouse brain, which showed substantial mouse survival enhancement [61] .

This can have several drawbacks, including complications related to lumbar puncture, poor CNS distribution of SSOs and lack of any therapeutic benefits for the peripheral pathological component of the disease. A recent study in SMA mice has also shown that subcutaneous administration of several low doses of PMO had a greater effect in increasing the average survival of SMA mice than a single high-dose ICV bolus injection [79] .

Ongoing work aims to carry out detailed in vivo studies in parallel of both activity and toxicology to identify novel peptides with acceptable therapeutic index that may be suitable leads for drug development.
