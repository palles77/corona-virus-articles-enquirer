Molecular assays currently available for detection of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-Cov) have low sensitivity during the early stage of the illness. Objective: To develop and evaluate a sensitive diagnostic test for SARS by optimizing the viral RNA extraction methods and by applying real-time quantitative RT-PCR technology. Study design : 50 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples collected from days 1 \u00c1/3 of disease onset from SARS patients in whom SARS CoV infections was subsequently serologically confirmed and 30 negative control samples were studied. Samples were tested by: (1) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a routine RNA extraction method (Lancet 361 (2003) 1319), (2) our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method, (3) a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay with a modified RNA extraction method. Results : Of 50 NPA specimens collected during the first 3 days of illness, 11 (22%) were positive in our first generation RT-PCR assay. With a modification in the RNA extraction protocol, 22 (44%) samples were positive in the conventional RT-PCR assay. By combining the modified RNA extraction method and real-time quantitative PCR technology, 40 (80%) of these samples were positive in the real-time RT-PCR assay. No positive signal was observed in the negative controls. Conclusion : By optimizing RNA extraction methods and applying quantitative real time RT-PCR technologies, the sensitivity of tests for early diagnosis of SARS can be greatly enhanced. #",

            "text": "The clinical case definition of SARS is essentially one of fever and pneumonia, with or without a contact history. There are many causes of pneumonia and in the absence of a definite history of contact with other patients with SARS, it is not easy to differentiate SARS from other causes of pneumonia. Laboratory tests that can confirm a diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection early in the course of the illness are therefore a critical clinical need. It allows prompt patient management, isolation and quarantine, thereby minimizing the risk of having large-scale outbreaks in hospitals or in local communities (Riley et al., 2003) . Serology is a sensitive and specific diagnostic approach but seroconversion can only be detected around day 10 of illness and in some patients, especially if they have been treated with immunomodulator drugs such as steroids, may be delayed until the 3rd or 4th week of the disease. In any event, they only provide a retrospective diagnosis. Detection of virus by RT-PCR in clinical specimens offers the option of diagnosis in the early stage of the disease . However, in contrast with many other acute respiratory infections (e.g. influenza) (Kaiser et al., 1999) , our previous studies demonstrated that viral loads in NPA are low in the first few days of illness and peak around day 10 of the disease (Peiris et al., 2003b) . This profile of viral activity poses a challenge for the diagnosis of SARS during the first few days of the illness, the period when such a diagnosis would be most useful, both for patient management and public health. The clinical sensitivity of first generation RT-PCR methods during the first few days of disease has been low and much better sensitivity is obtained after day 6 of the illness (Peiris et al., 2003b) . On the other hand, the gradual increase in viral load implies that the window for effective therapeutic intervention with an antiviral is wider than that with other respiratory viral diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza infections.",

The overall detection rate of the modified RT-PCR protocol was statistically different from the other two assays (McNemar's test, P B/0.0001, Table 1 ). In particular, 63% of the NPA samples isolated on day 1 of disease onset was positive in the real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. By contrast, none of the specimens isolated on day 1 was positive in the conventional RT-PCR assay. For samples isolated on days 2 \u00c1/3, more than 81% of these samples was positive in the quantitative assay (Table 1) . With the modified RNA extraction protocol and realtime PCR technology, the specificity and sensitiv- ity of the quantitative assay towards early SARS samples were 80% and 100%, respectively.",

In particular, we focused on detecting SARS-CoV RNA in samples isolated on days 1\u00c1/3 of disease onset. Using our first generation conventional RT-PCR assay (Peiris et al., 2003a,b) , only 22% of these samples were shown to have SARS-CoV RNA. In order to establish a more sensitive assay, we modified the RNA extraction method and adapted the quantitative technology in our current study. By increasing the initial volume for RNA extraction from 140 to 540 ml, the proportion of positive cases was increased to 44%. In addition, by further applying the real-time quantitative PCR technology in the revised assay, 80% of early SARS samples became positive. More importantly, the use of a 5? nuclease probe in the real-time quantitative assay can minimize the false positive rate due to an increased in signal specificity. Taken together, results from this study suggested that our revised RT-PCR assay allows the early and accurate diagnosis of SARS.",
