Coronaviruses Were demonstrated by electron microscopic examination of the faeces and intestinal contents, immunofluorescent staining of sections of small and large intestine and by isolation in tracheal organ cultures. In early passages of the British coronavirus, particles of about 30 nm in diameter were observed in the faeces by electron microscopy. These particles were removed from the coronavirus preparations by cross-protection experiments in calves. The coronaviruses were morphologically and antigenically similar to the bovine coronavirus isolated in the United States and the British virus was adapted to replicate in calf kidney cell cultures.",

Although both British coronaviruses were identified in field material by electron microscopy, this method is unsuitable for routine diagnosis because of the length of time required to prepare and examine each sample and as the numbers of virus particles in watery faecal samples can be low. The fringed particles which are found in normal faeces make it more difficult to visualize coronavirus particles than, for example, particles of rotavirus. As the coronaviruses could not be isolated readily in cell culture from diarrhoeic material, the other two methods, immunofluorescent staining of gut sections and isolation in tracheal organ cultures, may be more suitable for diagnosis. Immunofluorescent staining of sections from the spiral colon of infected animals has the advantage that fluorescent antigen persists for several days (Mebus et ah, 1973) but this method can only be used on calves which have been killed and is therefore limited to a herd diagnosis. Isolation in tracheal organ cultures was successful for the three viruses studied in this paper and the American virus (Stott et al., 1977) and may prove a useful diagnostic test to determine the incidence of bovine coronavirus infection in outbreaks of enteritis.",
