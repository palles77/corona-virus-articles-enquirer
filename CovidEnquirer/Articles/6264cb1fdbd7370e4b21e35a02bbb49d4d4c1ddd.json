As severe and unpredicted adverse events dramatically showed in the recent years that the immune system is a critical aspect of drug safety, this framework needs to be revisited to enhance the prediction of nonclinical immune safety evaluation. Safety immunopharmacology is deemed to contribute to this awaited improvement by enabling early screening of the potential for drug candidates to induce unexpected immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects as well as nonimmune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Dedicated safety immunopharmacology can also generate mechanistic data to determine which relevant additional immunotoxicity studies should be conducted. Immunological assays and models that can be considered for use in the context of safety pharmacology studies are presented as well as perspectives for their timely development.",

Indeed, two major limitations to the nonclinical safety evaluation of biologics are: (i) immunogenicity, potentially resulting in the generation of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies, which in turn limits the duration and relevance of non-clinical toxicity studies (Ponce et al., 2009) , and (ii) the lack of a relevant conventional animal species that can tentatively be replaced by transgenic or diseased animals in which regulatory toxicity studies are faced with many challenges and hurdles (Bussiere et al., 2009 ). Therefore, safety immunopharmacology studies can be expected to serve as useful add-ons to generate relevant missing data that standard toxicity studies are unable to generate. Moreover, the search for small molecular entities that target the immune system to treat a variety of diseases ranging from cancer to allergic or autoimmune diseases is rapidly expanding (Tsitoura & Tassios, 2006; Erter et al., 2010; Nicholas, Giannetti, Alsanousi, Friede, & Muraro, 2011) .

In contrast, when a cause for concern (either one marked finding or at least two milder findings among the items listed above) has been identified, additional immunotoxicity studies should be conducted. Additional immunotoxicity studies typically consist of repeated-dose (at least 4-weeks) toxicity studies conducted, mostly in rodents, in the course of which selected immune functions are investigated. A T-dependent antibody response (TDAR) assay is widely considered the first-line assay as it can globally and simultaneously assess the effect of a drug candidate on antigen presentation, helper T lymphocyte function and B lymphocytedependent antibody production. Immunotoxicologists have long used the plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay in rodents (Ladics, 2007) . Over the last decade, the anti-KLH antibody response (measured by ELISA) has emerged as the preferred assay (Plitnick & Herzyk, 2010) . Indeed, the anti-KLH assay can be used in rodents as well as non-rodents in sharp contrast to the PFC assay, which can only be used in rodents. KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) is a better standardized antigen than sheep erythrocytes, the antigens utilized in the PFC assay. The anti-KLH assay is also less time consuming and the reproducibility of results seemingly better.",

One obvious drawback of the anti-KLH assay as compared to the PFC assay is that the standard procedure comprises a minimal duration of 14-21 days for the anti-KLH assay vs. 4-5 days for the PFC assay for measuring the humoral response. However, White, Sheth, and Peachee (2007) proposed a short-term anti-KLH IgM screening assay in the mouse as an alternative to the PFC assay. Mice were injected once with 2 mg KLH/mouse via the intravenous route, and sera were collected on day +5 to measure anti-KLH IgM by ELISA. The reference immunosuppressive drugs cyclophosphamide (range: 5-60 mg/kg/day), azathioprine (25-200 mg/kg/day) and cyclosporine (25-200 mg/kg/day) induced a significantly dose-dependent decrease in anti-KLH IgM levels. Using the same dose range, a very similar trend was observed in the PFC assay although the latter assay was slightly more sensitive that the anti-KLH IgM assay. The high level of predictability of the PFC assay has long been demonstrated with a wide panel of immunosuppressive agents (Luster et al., 1992) and it is noteworthy that the immunosuppressive potential of cyclosporine was serendipitously discovered thanks to the systematic use of the PFC assay (Borel, Feurer, Gubler, & St\u00e4helin, 1976) . That White et al. (2007) found similar effects in the short-term anti-KLH IgM mouse screening assay with 3 prototypic immunosuppressive drugs whose effects are well-characterized in humans support the conclusion that this assay is likely to be as predictive as the PFC assay. In addition, this screening assay offers the advantage of using the same T-dependent antigen, namely KLH, than the antigen increasingly used in TDAR assays that can be included in dedicated immunotoxicity studies at a later stage of development.",

            "text": "Cell-mediated immunity can be straightforwardly assessed using either a DTH model in mice or rats, or a contact hypersensitivity model in mice with 5-7 days between sensitization and challenge. In rodents, DTH is typically measured from the increase in footpad thickness (footpad assay) induced by an eliciting injection of the selected antigen (e.g. SRBC, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin\u2026) into one hind footpad of animals previously sensitized by a subcutaneous injection of the same antigen into the back or abdomen. Contact hypersensitivity is measured from the increase in ear thickness (ear assay) induced by an eliciting application of a potent contact sensitizer (e.g. oxazolone, dinitrofluorobenzene or picryl chloride) on both sides of one ear in animals previously sensitized by a prior topical application of the same sensitizer on both sides of the contralateral ear. In keeping with their well-known clinical activity in humans, immunosuppressive drugs have been shown to induce a reduced increase in footpad or ear thickness, which supports the conclusion that these models can be suitable early predictors of the unexpected or unintended immunosuppressive potential of drug candidates (Descotes, Tedone, & Evreux, 1985; Smith & White, 2010) . Neutrophil functions primarily include chemotaxis and phagocytosis, the latter mainly consisting of bacterial ingestion and oxidative burst. Various techniques are available to measure neutrophil function endpoints either in vitro or in vivo. Beside many assays used for research purpose, classical techniques using Boyden's chamber or agarose for the evaluation of chemotaxis, bacterial ingestion counting and chemiluminescence for phagocytosis are either time consuming or biased by individual subjectivity, and/or require technical skill and/or expensive equipment. However, flow cytometry techniques can be used to measure chemotaxis and phagocytosis (Lehmann, Sornes, & Halstensen, 2000) and they are considered well suited to safety immunopharmacology studies (Horand, Cretinon, Condevaux, & Descotes, 2003) . It is noteworthy that flow cytometry techniques are routinely used in clinical immunology laboratories to test human subjects, especially children suspected of inborn defects, for their capacity to ingest bacteria, or mount oxidative burst or adequate chemotactic response. Although the database with pharmaceuticals using these techniques is still limited, available results suggest they have sufficient predictability (Freebern, Bigwarfe, Price, & Haggerty, submitted for publication).",

The PFC or anti-KLH IgM assay can be used for an early prediction of the immunosuppressive potential of drug candidates following short-term administrations (i.e. 4-5 days). Depending on results of the TDAR assay, the mechanism of action of the drug candidate, and the intended future therapeutic indication, other assays and models can be used in early safety immunopharmacology assessment. Indeed, DTH models focus on T cell-mediated immune responses, whereas neutrophil function assays can provide useful information on selective effects on phagocytosis, oxidative burst or chemotaxis depending on the selected assay. As already mentioned, there is a fairly good concordance of results obtained in these assays provided they are actually performed\u2026",

Nevertheless, they are very seldom included in the preclinical safety assessment of drug candidates although there is a fairly good concordance of results when compared to human findings, most often retrospectively. Safety immunopharmacology studies are believed to be primarily helpful to improve the immune safety assessment of either small-molecular-weight drug candidates with intended or unexpected immunomodulatory activities, or biologics whose immunogenicity precludes the conduct of standard repeated-dose toxicity studies of sufficient duration.",
