We assessed the documents that some Asia-Pacifi c countries have published as part of preparedness planning for an outbreak of infl uenza in people. Regional approaches were polarised. Thailand, China, and Vietnam had set out a strategic vision to strengthen future capacity in preparedness planning. By contrast, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand took a strategic approach aimed mainly at harnessing available resources or preparing for the deployment of resources such as stockpiled antiviral agents and vaccines. The plans of Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand compared favourably with the best European plans. The plans of resource-poor countries addressed some issues that were largely neglected by most European plans. Other countries (including those that do not yet have plans) could benefi t from analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the plans drawn up by countries in the region and in Europe.",

WHO's global infl uenza preparedness plan, which was launched in 1999, was updated in 2005. The plan outlines components that countries should include in their national preparedness plans to ensure an eff ective response. 4 In 2005, WHO published a checklist to facilitate preparedness planning. 5 The aims of such planning were to reduce transmission; decrease the incidence of new cases, hospital admissions, and deaths; maintain essential services; and reduce the socioeconomic consequences of a pandemic. 5 In our own assessment of European national preparedness plans 6 we concluded that although Europe was broadly well prepared, important gaps, weaknesses, and inconsistencies remained. We identifi ed a need for operational planning, in particular, to be strengthened. We also suggested that although European countries had explicitly expressed their interest in cooperating with international institutions such as the European Centre for Disease Control and WHO, regional cooperation between countries was inadequate. Here, we have analysed pandemic infl uenza plans from selected countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region, emphasising specifi c concerns about preparedness in this region.",

However, we could not obtain copies of any national preparedness plans for Cambodia, Laos, or Indonesia. We included plans that were published between Jan 1, 2002 and Feb 28, 2006. The six plans were reviewed according to seven themes: planning and coordination; surveillance; public-health inter ventions; health-system response; maintenance of essential services; communication; and putting plans into action. 18 Some countries-Thailand, China, and, to a lesser degree, Vietnam-had set out a strategic vision to strengthen future capacity in preparedness planning. Others, including Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, *China has issued several documents addressing preparedness, planning, and contingency implementation: Preparedness and contingency planning for infl uenza pandemic; Emergency planning for human infections-pandemic outbreak of avian infl uenza; Guidance for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of infections of avian infl uenza; National emergency planning for animal pandemic outbreak; National emergency planning for highly pathogenic avian infl uenza; Contingency implementation plan for the prevention and control on highly pathogenic avian infl uenza in autumn and winter in 2005; and Contingency working procedure of prevention and control on pathogenic avian infl uenza in autumn and winter in 2005. 8 Table: Country pandemic infl uenza plans took a strategic approach similar to that of most European plans. These strategic plans focused on management of currently available resources and preparation for the deployment of resources such as stockpiled antiviral agents and vaccines. The polarisation of approaches in the region contrasts with the uniform approach taken by countries in Europe. The plans of Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand compared very favourably in terms of completeness and quality with the best European plans. However, as in Europe, all of the plans contained some gaps. The plans of lower-income countries in the region addressed several issues that were largely neglected by most European plans. The potential therefore exists for countries (including those which are still formulating their plans) to draw on the strengths of preparedness plans developed by other countries. The panel summarises some strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the preparedness plans of these selected Asia-Pacifi c countries. For brevity, diff erences between countries and areas of coherence are presented by comparing planned public-health interventions.",

As any outbreak in an Asia-Pacifi c country would probably originate in a rural area, all the Asia-Pacifi c plans focused on this setting, and on early containment strategies. For example, specifi c situations with cases in animals were included in the planning for human pandemic phases. As a result, the Asia-Pacifi c countries more closely and explicitly linked their planned responses to human infl uenza pandemics with those for avian infl uenza. The Asia-Pacifi c plans also emphasised the integration of human and animal health more than did the equivalent plans in Europe. The Hong Kong plan was especially strong in its attention to issues that could be important to countries of southeast Asia and that had not been fully addressed elsewhere. These issues included the need for improved exchange of surveillance information between health and animal sectors, the capacity for joint investigation and response, and the education of poultry smallholders and wet-market poultry workers. Another notable strength of the Asia-Pacifi c plans was that the countries we selected had incorporated lessons learned from the recent past, including from H5N1 and SARS outbreaks, into their pandemic preparedness plans. 11, 13 For example, during the SARS outbreak, databases linked to the police system for tracking down criminals were used to coordinate mass-contact tracing. This so-called major incident and disaster support system will, during an infl uenza pandemic, be used again. A further important diff erence between the Asia-Pacifi c countries' plans and those in Europe was their focus on the early containment of disease, and their coherence in strategies such as social distancing. For example, all countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region recommended use of travel restrictions or screening measures. Whether this coherence was by design is unclear.",

But national responses aimed at controlling potential pandemics remain just that-national. Although the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remains a loose coalition, it could nevertheless draw on the early experience of initiatives such as the European Centre for Disease Control, and attempt to steer the preparedness planning of Asia-Pacifi c countries. The international community has recently been giving substantial support and attention to the issue of emerging infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacifi c region. For example, WHO's Asia-Pacifi c strategy for emerging diseases aimed to strengthen capacities to detect, prepare for, and respond to disease, and off ered a framework to achieve this in the short, medium, and long term. 1 Although the WHO Strategy addressed the broader notion of emerging diseases, the threat of pandemic infl uenza was clearly a driving factor and provided a sense of urgency. The document did not, however, \"contain implementation guidelines or work plans, as these will be developed later, as part of implementation planning\". 1 The importance of coherence between national approaches has been acknowledged by political commitment from ASEAN, along with other institutions such as WHO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the Asian Development Bank. The fi rst East Asia Summit on avian infl uenza, held on Dec 14, 2005, promoted the \"active cooperation and various regional initiatives of ASEAN in responding to the challenges posed by avian infl uenza, inter-alia, through strengthening institutional linkages, developing partnership with all stakeholders, sharing information and coordinating regional initiatives\". 20 Substantial investment has been planned for eff orts to combat avian infl uenza and pandemic human infl uenza in the region. National governments have committed additional funds, the World Bank has launched a programme of support, the Asian Development Bank has contributed funds, and a January, 2006, conference in Beijing pledged US$1\u00b79 billion. 21, 22 Concerns have been raised within the region, however, that much of this money would not be new, that many of the funds would be made available as loans rather than as grants, and that tangible benefi ts to populations in the region would not be certain. The slow pace of disbursement of funding has also been criticised. 23",

Most affl uent countries have stockpiled antiviral drugs and, in the event of a pandemic, could also rely on their capacity to produce vaccines or agreements to obtain vaccine rapidly. By contrast, one could argue that lower-income countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region would fi nd it diffi cult to access suffi cient quantities of these globally scarce resources. These countries also face challenges in dealing with other communicable diseases. Without a greater international commitment to share scarce stocks of antiviral drugs and vaccines more equitably, countries in the Asia-Pacifi c region will not be able to access these resources, or to distribute them eff ectively. Massive logistical challenges would have to be met for any pandemic, which will probably originate in this region, to be contained at an early stage. 24 If this were to prove unattainable, some have warned of a potential risk that poor countries in the region would be reluctant to cooperate with the international community-eg, by providing information to assist with disease surveillance, or isolates of the virus to facilitate vaccine development and production. Countries might choose not to prioritise these tasks if faced with uncertain returns and a range of other pressing demands.",
