SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE, VOL. 73, No. 5, 1979 The development of folate deficiency in tropical malabsorbtion There are many descriptions of folate deficiency developing in a variety of infective malabsorption syndromes (WELLCOME TRUST COLLABORATIVE STUDY, 1971) . The nomenclature has been confusing. but once parasitic infection, in particular eiardiasis and stronavloidiasis, has been excluded z is customary to differentiate those severe cases with tropical sprue (malabsorption of two or more unrelated substances) from those with milder or subclinical features usually classified as tropical enteropathy. In villages in south India there are well defined epidemics of tropical sprue which occur against a background of levels of absorption in asymptomatic subjects which are abnormal when compared to U.K. residents. In natives of Puerto Rico and Haiti the comparison between patients with tropical sprue and control subjects is more distinct, both at a functional level as assessed by tests of absorption and at a morphological level according to appearances of the jejunal mucosa. The findings in expatriates developing tropical malabsorption are different again. Diarrhoea is extremely common in expatriates whether volunteer workers (LINDENBAUM et al., 1966) , professionals, military personnel or travellers. Transient malabsorption is common during these episodes but, in most, lasts for a few weeks only (LINDENBAUM, 1965) . A proportion, however, develop symptoms which persist for months or even years accompanied by nutritional deficiencies as described in British soldiers in Singapore, American servicemen in Vietnam and expatriates who were travelling or temporarily resident in the subcontinent of India (TOMKINS et al., 1974) . Folate deficiency is an important nutritional problem in many of these syndromes but there are striking and characteristic differences in frequency and severity of anaemia between the various clinical -groups. These have been reviewed in detail by KLIPSTEIN (1967) .",

This is partly due to the problems of obtaining reliable intake measurements among villagers but also because of a basic lack of information on the folate contents of foods, whether in the raw state or after cooking. Nevertheless O'Brien vividly describes the jettisoning of the almost inedible tinned rations issued to British servicemen in jungle conditions (WELLCOME TRUST COLLABOR-ATIVE STUDY, 1971 ). The prohibitive cost of fresh vegetables together with absolute scarcity at certain seasons may be critical factors in limiting folate intake by the villager in developing communities such as in south India. The deleterious effect of prolonged soaking and cooking with resultant oxidation of dietary folate is a serious enough problem in developed countries. It is even worse in poorer communities where folate sources such as lentils require considerable cooking before they become digestible.",

Corcino and co-workers have prepared synthetic polyglutamate, radio-actively labelled within the pteridine ring in such a way that it was possible to measure digestion and absorption of folate in patients with tropical sprue in Puerto Rico (CORCINO et al., 1976) . They demonstrated impaired hydrolysis of the polyglutamate as well as less satisfactory absorption of its digestion product folic acid; digestion and absorption were both markedly improved when measured after a six-month course of tetracycline. Certain features remain unexplained; a particular problem is that many studies, including that of Corcino, have shown normal or even increased levels of the enzyme folate conjugase whether measured in the luminal fluid or in mucosal samples (KLIPSTEIN, 1967) . The pH optimum of folate conjugase, 4.3, is not conducive to maximal activity within the lumen.

In weanling animals fed a folate-deficient diet to which sulphadimidine has been added to inhibit folate synthesis by intestinal bacteria, it has been possible to prepare mucosal samples and assay the folate which is stimulatory to the growth of Lactobacillus casei . This is in general an appropriate assay to use because it measures Smethyl tetrahydrofolate, the metabolically active form in most tissues. However, recent work in mammalian intestine has shown the considerable variety of folate analogues that are present (B~~~~etaZ., 1974) . A further problem is that actively proliferating cells have greater concentrations than more sIowly metabolizing cells, a factor which makes it difficult to interpret the results of analysis of a mixture of crypt and villus cells as, for example, in the small piece of tissue sampled at iejunal biopsy.",

            "text": "An alternative approach is to assess the functional folate status of the mucosa, concentrating particularly on the activity of the folate-dependent enzymes necessary for synthesis of DNA for cell replication. The conventional de YZOWJ pathway for thymidylate (precursor of DNA) synthesis is by the conversion of deoxyuridylate+deoxyuridine monophosphate (Fig. 1) . This reaction depends on adequate supply of folate for the activity of the key enzyme in this conversion, thymidylate synthetase. In the presence of inhibitors of this enzyme or in nutritional folate deficiency the alternative, 'salvage' pathway is utilized whereby preformed thymidine is incorporated (TOMKINS et al., 1976) . Indeed, in experimental folate deficiency, thymidine kinase (the enzyme associated with the salvage pathway) activity of isolated crypt cells is five times higher than in controls (BADCOCK & TOMKINS, 1978 'suppress' the uptake of radio-actively labelled thymidine (3H TdR) into DNA (via pathway B in Fig. 1 ) provided there is adequate folate to permit the activity of thymidylate synthetase (pathway A, Fig. 1 ). In 'control' subjects, those with diarrhoea but without malabsorption or folate deficiency, there is suppression to approximately 20 \"I by the addition of dU (Fig. 2) . The addition of folic acid to the incubation medium makes no difference to the degree of suppression, provided folate status of the tissue is normal.",

Only two of these patients, however, had megaloblastic anaemia, the remainder had normal bone marrow morphology and red blood cell folate concentrations suggesting that mucosal malnutrition occurs in the absence of systemic deficiency. The jejunal epithelium has very high folate requirements because of the demand for DNA synthesis by the crypt cells. They probably rely to a considerable degree on intraluminal supply and any disturbance in intraluminal metabolism, perhaps due to bacteria adherent to the mucosa (TOMKINS ef al., 1975) , could affect mucosal nutrient status.",

It is now well established that ethanol, a metabolic product of the abnormal intestinal microflora that we (TOMKINS et al., 1975) and others have demonstrated in jejunal fluid from patients with tropical sprue, has a deleterious effect on intestinal enzyme activity (GREENE et al., 1974) . This effect may be ameliorated if folic acid is given at the same time as the ethanol. The demonstration of an increase in glycolytic enzyme activity of the mucosa obtained from volunteers shortly after taking folic acid infers that folate may be important in pathways of protein synthesis. The requirements for new protein synthesis in jejunal mucosa are extremely high, 146 ') (, of the protein (MCNURLAN et al., 1978) content being resynthesized every day. There is no direct information on the effect of folate deficiency on protein turnover in gut but in a study of patients with severe megaloblastic anaemia in Nigeria the authors suggested that the raised plasma amino-acid levels were the result of failure of methylation and formylation of RNA due to the folate deficiency (JACOBS & FLEMING, 1970) .",

Virus particles are uncommon in healthy children in developed communities. This contrast with the findings in developing areas, such as south India, where many asymptomatic children have virus-like particles in faecal specimens (MATHAN et al., 1975 Our own studies in Nigeria also suggest that these are acquired in very early life (Table I) , being present in a high proportion of breast fed infants, without diarrhoea, during the first year of life.

There are also characteristic increases in the incidence of gastro-enteritis and malnutrition during the rainy season in areas such as northern Nigeria (DOSSETOR, 1975) , where careful seasonal studies show no evidence of limitation of energy or protein intakes (SIMMONDS, 1971) , in the adults at least. A striking feature here, however, is that nearly half the infants are abruptly weaned off the breast during the early months of the rains, possibly as a result of the pressures on women in certain areas to work on the fields (Fig. 4) . Apart from the problem of energy and protein deficiency as a result of this rapid weaning there is a drastic reduction in folate supply. Breast milk is the major source of dietary folate, especially important during the rainy season when the only other source of folate (fresh vegetables) is particularly scarce. A study from another area in Nigeria has recently emphasized the close association of megaloblastic anaemia with protein energy malnutrition (AKIN- KUGBE, 1977) clearly showing that anaemia is most common in the season with most gastro-enteritis and malnutrition.",

However, despite the widespread occurrence of folate deficiency in many children in developing countries and the impression among many paediatricians that folic acid therapy improves malnourished children with chronic diarrhoea, there is little published information.
