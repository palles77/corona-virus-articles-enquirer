They consist of a 5 fully competent vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene. From the 6 perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be intrinsically 7 detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete the transgene may evolve to dominate the within-8 host population and in doing so reduce the antigenicity of the vaccine. We apply mathematical and 9 computational models to study this process, including the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth 10 plus the dynamics of innate and adaptive immunity. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is 11 easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that, despite possible 12 fitness differences between vaccine and revertant, the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the 13 short period of growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant per se does not 14 interfere with immunity to vaccine except as the revertant suppresses vaccine abundance; the magnitude 15 of this interference depends on mechanisms and timing of viral suppression. Adaptive immunity targeting 16 the foreign antigen is also a possible basis of vaccine inferiority, but it is not worsened by vaccine evolution.",

The arguments presented 106 above are qualitative and only superficially identify the scope of the problem. Quantitative understanding 107 ultimately rests on analysis of mathematical models. However, as the models have many interacting processes 108 -minimally innate immunity, adaptive immunity and intrinsic growth differences between vaccine versus inferiority. Yet even if vaccine selective 'neutrality' turns out to be fleeting, merely a mistaken impression 119 from short-term observations, we will find that the phenomenon of short-term stability mirrors a solution to 120 minimize vaccine evolution within the host. infections [26] [27] [28] [29] . The relative role of each mechanism in clearing infections is the basis of ongoing discussion, 145 but it is widely accepted that the roles differ among infections by different viruses and that each mechanism 146 is potentially important for some viruses. Adaptive immunity. 165 Adaptive immunity can be induced by the wild-type vector and the vaccine virus. Adaptive immune responses 166 specific to antigens expressed by the wild-type vector will presumably affect the vaccine and revertant equally 167 -because the vaccine encodes a complete vector genome, and the revertant is also a complete vector. As with 168 the preceding pair of mechanisms, adaptive immunity common to both revertant and vaccine will operate so 169 that revertant abundance will depress vaccine. Adaptive immunity to the vaccine antigen will be considered 170 shortly. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

However, there are different stages or degrees of vaccine suppression, 174 so an early mechanism may act to control the infection without clearing it, and another mechanism may 175 act later to clear. Because of the delay in developing an adaptive response, viral suppression by adaptive 176 immunity typically occurs later than effects of innate immunity or resource limitation and so might seem 177 to be unimportant in vaccine evolution. Yet adaptive immunity may be important in clearing the vaccine 178 following control by other mechanisms, in which case it could have an important role in vaccine evolution. The preceding paragraphs omitted adaptive immunity to the antigen. By its very nature, adaptive immunity 182 suppresses vaccine growth. But adaptive immunity to the antigen is specific to the vaccine and is thus 183 another reason -besides intrinsic fitness effects -that the vaccine may have lower fitness than revertant.",

This requires that the antigen 300 rapidly elicits immunity (i.e. has low \u03c6 X , and in terms of immunology it should be an immunogenic antigen), 301 and also requires a high vaccine viral load to generate a large response.

Vaccines designed to express the antigen in a form that is different from 304 that in the pathogen might help solve this problem.

In either case the revertant will then suppress antigen 126 levels. Again, the problem is complicated by the limited duration of the infection: reduced antigen production used in ecology for population growth [24,25].

Innate immunity is triggered by conserved molecules associated149 with pathogens [23]. Conserved structures of pathogens targeted by innate immunity include dsRNA, 150 frequently accompanying viral replication, plus lipopolysaccharides and endotoxins of bacteria [30]. Because 151 innate immunity involves the activation of a standing population of immune cells such as macrophages and 152 dendritic cells, or triggering of the complement pathway, it can be elicited much more rapidly than the 153 adaptive response; the latter requires many rounds of clonal expansion of rare antigen-specific cells to generate 154 a population large enough to control the infection [31]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the 155 innate response is required for the initial stimulation of the adaptive response [32]. Thus, innate immunity 156 has a major role in early suppression of the viral population. Innate immunity can suppress both vector and 157vaccine, and it is not likely to discriminate between two genomes that differ by a single, non-essential gene 158 (the transgene).",

However, with parameters that result in considerable evolution (high mutation rate, high initial 229 frequency and large growth advantage for the revertant virus), the vaccine virus is suppressed and cleared 230 earlier, reducing cumulative lifetime production of vaccine virus, and thus of vaccine antigen and of immunity 231 to the vaccine antigen.232Illustrations of dynamics from individual trials convey many details. However, without a specific empirical 233 basis for the parameter values chosen, the details have little assured relevance. We therefore provide contour 234 plots that allow easy comparison of many different trials(Fig. 4). These graphs show the cumulative vaccine235 load (left panel) and final level of immunity to vaccine (right) as a function of initial revertant frequencies 236 and selective advantage of the revertant (c). A strong correspondence exists between virus load and the 237 level of immunity generated, as is observed following infection [37]. (Subsequent figures therefore illustrate 238 the level of immunity.) The initial composition of the inoculum matters somewhat more to the adaptive 239 response than does the intrinsic cost of the vaccine (as evident by the contours being closer to vertical rather 240 than horizontal). When the inoculum is mostly vaccine and revertant fitness is not high, evolution has little 241 effect on viral load or final level of immunity (i.e., the lower left of each panel has a broad area of one color) 242 -because of the short duration of infection.

A different solution is to design the vaccine with less of a disadvantage. The most obvious 338 realm for this approach is in vaccine engineering: the timing and tissues of antigen expression, location of 339 the transgene in the vector genome, and the size of the transgene may all influence intrinsic fitness effects be to 'pre-adapt' the vector in vitro on host cells expressing the antigen in trans. This adapted 342 vector would then be used as the vaccine backbone. Another simple approach would be to compete several 343 different vaccine designs in vitro and pick the design with fastest growth. Any approach using in vitro 344 adaptation needs to avoid adapting the vector to the extent that it compromises ability to grow in vivo. 345 5. Discussion 346 Any live viral vaccine may evolve within the host. The potential for attenuated viruses to revert to wild-type 347 virulence is well appreciated [1,2], even if it presents a problem for relatively few vaccines (e.g., attenuated 348 polio: [40]). There is also a potential for live, recombinant vector vaccines to evolve -our focus in this 349 paper -with the main concern being loss or reduced expression of the transgenic insert [4,41]. If the vaccine 350 evolution occurs fast enough or the vaccine infection persists long enough, loss of the insert could reduce 351 vaccine efficacy. 352 We developed and analyzed models to explore ways in which vaccine evolution could lead to a reduction in 353 vaccine efficacy. An intrinsic fitness advantage of the revertant virus, expected because engineering transgene 354 expression is likely to have metabolic and other costs, will lead to vaccine being gradually overgrown by 355 revertant. Yet this is only likely to cause a reduction in the immunity to the vaccine antigen if it leads to a 356 reduction in the absolute amount (as opposed to merely a reduction in relative frequency) of the vaccine virus. 357 Ascent of revertant can reduce the amount of the vaccine virus if the revertant uses resources required for 358 virus replication or the vaccine virus is cleared by the innate or adaptive responses elicited by the revertant.",

            "text": "Measuring the intrinsic fitness effect of the transgene is likely to be an important step in vaccine design. For375 assessing vaccine evolution, the relevant biological realm is within the host. Nonetheless, in vitro growth 376 environments may reveal much about a vaccine's intrinsic propensity to evolve loss of antigen expression. 377 There are various ways intrinsic fitness effects and their evolutionary consequences might be studied. Vaccine 378 growth in tissue culture may reveal some aspects of intrinsic fitness effects and should be relatively easy 379 to study. Loss of the transgene per se would be detectable by PCR, and the fitness advantage of revertant 380 over vaccine could be measured from changes in revertant frequency. The quantitative relevance of an in 381 vitro estimate to in vivo growth would be unknown, but the measure should allow qualitatively comparing 382 engineering designs that improve intrinsic vaccine fitness. If vaccine reversion were due to down regulation 383 of the transgene instead of loss, fitness estimation would require knowing the mutations responsible and 384 monitoring their frequencies. Use of culture-wide antigen levels to measure fitness might provide a sense 385",
