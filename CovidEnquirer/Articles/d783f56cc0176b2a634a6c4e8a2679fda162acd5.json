We first identified four HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes derived from SARS-CoV using HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice and recombinant adenovirus expressing predicted epitopes. These peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes, and inoculated into mice. Two of the liposomal peptides were effective for peptide-specific CTL induction, and one of them was efficient for the clearance of vaccinia virus expressing epitopes of SARS-CoV, suggesting that the surface-linked liposomal peptide might offer an effective CTLbased vaccine against SARS.",

More than 8000 cases of SARS had been identified worldwide, and nearly 800 patients had died before the epidemic ended [1] . The etiologic agent of SARS has turned out to be a novel coronavirus termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] [3] [4] , which is a plus-stranded RNA virus with an approximately 30-kb long genome encoding replicase gene products and the structural proteins containing spike (S), envelop (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Until now, the viral genome has been sequenced [5] and the viral receptor has been identified [6] . However, the pathogenesis of SARS remains poorly understood, and the apparent latency of SARS-CoV in animal reservoirs continuously provides us a serious threat of reemergence. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against SARS.",

Accordingly, S protein is a major target for neutralizing antibodies [7] . High titers of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected in sera of the recovered patients [8] , and further, humoral immunity induced by a DNA vaccine contributed to the protection against SARS-CoV challenge in mice [7] . These data imply that neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in the clearance of SARS-CoV. On the other hand, a rapid loss of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells was observed in patients suffering from severe SARS, and the cell counts gradually returned to normal ranges as the patients recovered [9] . Furthermore, certain HLA class I alleles have been reported to correlate with SARS susceptibility [10, 11] . These data strongly suggest that, as with many other viral infections, virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be important for viral elimination in SARS as well.",

First, synthetic peptides rarely cause undesirable responses including general toxicity, immunosuppression and autoimmunity. Second, it is possible to select short peptides in the absence of amino acid mutations. Third, synthetic peptides can easily be prepared as a pure immunogen in large quantities. However, a major disadvantage is the weak immunogenicity. Therefore, it is critical to search for adjuvant vehi- cles which are non-immunogenic themselves but which enhance the immunogenicity of peptides.",

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that an OVA-derived peptide, OVA 257-264 conjugated on the surface of liposomes made from unsaturated, but not saturated fatty acid, induced OVA 257-264 -specific CTLs in mice more effectively than did liposomes containing OVA 257-264 inside [14, 15] . In addition, it was shown that surface-linked liposomal peptides were able to provide tumor eradication [15] and protection against viral challenge [14] in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that liposomes would become an excellent adjuvant vehicle for a synthetic peptide vaccine when a peptide(s) is chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes.",

N protein was chosen for the analyses because this is more conserved than S protein.

In agreement with the data of ICS (Fig. 2) , the four peptides, N-222 (Fig. 3C), N-223 (Fig. 3D), N-227 (Fig. 3E ) and N-317 (Fig. 3F ) elicited strong peptide-specific CTL responses in Ad-SARS-N8E-infected mice but not in Ad-WT-infected mice.

After immunization with either Ad-WT or Ad-SARS-N8E, HHD mice received i.v. injection of peptide-pulsed CFSE high targets and unpulsed CFSE low targets. Twelve hours later, spleen cells were prepared and peptide-specific lysis was assessed by flow cytometry.

Since four peptides including N-222, N-223, N-227 and N-317 were expected to be HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes (Figs. 2-4) , these peptides were chemically conjugated on the surface of liposomes. Surface-linked liposomal peptides, Lip-N222, Lip-N223, Lip-N227 and Lip-N317 were then evaluated for their capabilities of CTL induction in HHD mice. One week after immunization with each of the liposomal peptides, spleen cells were prepared, stimulated with a relevant peptide, and stained for their expression of surface CD8 and intracellular IFN-\u2425. As shown in Fig. 5 , significant numbers of IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells were elicited in mice that had been immunized once with either Lip-N223 or Lip-N227 in the footpad. In the case of Lip-N317, however, one injection with Lip-N317 did not result in the induction of IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells (Fig. 5) , and after three injections, a significant expansion of IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells in response to N-317 was finally observed (Fig. 5) , indicating that Lip-N317 might be less immunogenic than Lip-N223 and Lip-N227. On the other hand, Lip-N222 failed to elicit N-222-specific IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells in mice (Fig. 5 ) even after multiple injections. Since N-222 is a 10-mer peptide composed of an N-223 peptide with one additional leucine at the N-terminus (Table 1) , there was a possibility of cross reaction between N-222 and N-223. As shown in Fig. 6 , both N-222 and N-223 peptides obviously stimulated IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells in mice immunized with Lip-N223, demonstrating that N-223-specific CTLs primed by Lip-N223 was activated by stimulation with N-222 as well as N-223.

One week after immunization of mice, both peptide-pulsed CFSE high target cells and unpulsed CFSE low target cells were delivered into the mice via i.v. injection. As shown in Fig. 7 , the peptide-specific killing activity in Lip-N223-immunized mice was greater than that in Lip-N227immunized mice, indicating that Lip-N223 was more immunogenic than Lip-N227. Therefore, we next tested whether mice immunized with Lip-N223 were able to clear virus challenged. HHD mice were immunized twice with Lip-N223 at a 2-week interval. Two weeks after the last immunization, the mice were challenged with 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU of VV-SARS-N8E or VV-WT. After 5 days following the challenge, viral titers were measured in two ovaries of each mouse. As shown in Fig. 8 , titers of vaccinia virus in mice challenged with VV-SARS-N8E were 3 logs lower than those in mice challenged with VV-WT. Mice immunized with empty liposomes retained high viral titers after challenge with either VV-SARS-N8E (Fig. 8) or VV-WT (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that immunization with Lip-N223 is effective in the protection against virus. Fig. 3 .

            "text": "Since S protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors [6] , this is a major target for neutralizing antibodies [7] . Moreover, vigorous S-specific CTL responses were generated in SARS-CoV-infected patients [30, 31] , indicating that S protein is an antigen for CTL as well. In fact, four CTL epitopes derived from S protein have been identified [31] [32] [33] . However, since N protein is more conserved and synthesized earlier than S protein, N protein seems preferable to S protein as an antigenic target for T-cell immunity. Therefore, we focused on SARS-CoV N protein for the development of a CTL-based vaccine in the current study. High-performing computational algorithms have extensively been used for the identification of CTL epitopes [18, [31] [32] [33] [34] . Chentoufi et al. [34] supported their predictive computational algorithms by multiple immunological screenings. Thus, it is important to use multiple screenings for successful identification of functional CTL epitopes. We also performed multiple immunological screens, including cell surface stabilization of HLA-A*0201 molecules on T2 cells, detection of antigen-driven IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells, and functional in vivo and in vitro CTL assays. Our strategy for the identification of CTL epitopes has several advantages. First, the use of recombinant adenovirus and vaccinia virus allowed us to circumvent the necessity for handling live SARS-CoV. Both of the recombinant viruses, Ad-SARS-N8E and VV-SARS-N8E, carry the multiepitope minigene that encodes eight predicted epitopes with several natural flanking amino acid residues at both of the ends, thereby offering natural antigen processing in the infected cells. The basic idea comes from the observation that flanking sequences proximal to CTL epitopes modulate proteasomal processing of the epitopes [35, 36] . Furthermore, we can carry out in vitro and in vivo experiments using these viruses in BSL-2 facilities. Replication-defective recombinant adenovirus effectively induces CTLs specific for a protein encoded by a gene inserted into the viral genome [29, 37, 38] . Recombinant vaccinia virus can be employed as a virus challenged in the protection experiment [29, 39] . Second, we used highly reactive HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice, termed HHD mice [20] . Because the innate H-2D b and mouse \u24242m genes have been disrupted by homologous recombination in HHD mice, the only MHC class I molecule on the cell surface, HLA-A*0201, is efficiently utilized by HLA-A*0201-restricted CTLs. We used lymphocytes of HHD mice infected with Ad-SARS-N8E as a replacement for PBL of SARS patients. As a consequence, we identified three HLA- A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes, N-223, N-227, and N-317, derived from SARS-CoV-N, which were identical to those reported by Tsao et al. [40] . This indicates that our approach has proved to be practical in the epitope identification for viruses. However, it has to be taken account that there may be differences between the immunogenic variations observed in HLA class I transgenic mice and that in humans primarily because the antigen processing, presentation and ultimately, immunodominance may differ between them. Further, it will be necessary to use SARS-CoV for viral challenge experiments at the final stage.",

Of note, the most immunogenic liposomal peptide, Lip-N223 efficiently induced protection against viral challenge with vaccinia virus expressing N-223 (Fig. 8) . These data strongly suggest that the surface-linked liposomal peptide may offer an effective and safe CTL-based vaccine against SARS. However, in vivo CTL activity induced by Lip-N223 immunization was half of that induced by Ad-SARS-N8E (Figs. 4 and 7) although the level of IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells was similar between the Ad-SARS-N8E and Lip-N223 immunization (Figs. 2 and 5) . These data might suggest that liposomes disturb the CTL killing activity in some degree. Furthermore, a number of IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + T cells specific for N-317 were elicited in mice that had received one injection of Ad-SARS-N8E (Fig. 2) . In contrast, three injections of Lip-N317 were required for the significant induction of N-317-specific IFN-\u2425-producing CD8 + CTLs in mice (Fig. 5) .

Fist of all, self-adjuvanting lipopeptides stimulate peptide-specific CTLs via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 without any particular adjuvants [42, 43] . In contrast, induction of CTLs by surface-linked liposomal peptides requires external TLR ligands such as CpG [14] . However, it is well known that CpG causes toxicity in humans [44] . Hence, it is essential to find out a safe adjuvant for clinical use of liposomal peptides.

Four peptides that were expected to be epitopes were then chemically conjugated on the surface of liposomes. It was shown that two of the liposomal peptides were effective for peptide-specific CTL induction, and the most immunogenic liposomal peptide efficiently induced protection against viral challenge with vaccinia virus expressing this peptide. These data suggest that the surface-linked liposomal peptide may be useful for CTL-based immunotherapy against SARS.",
