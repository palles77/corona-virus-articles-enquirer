            "text": "Background: The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and significance of hypouricemia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS are thought to result from proinflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Acute renal failure has been reported in patients with SARS, but whether cytokines can injure renal tubules is unknown. Methods: Sixty patients diagnosed with SARS in Taiwan in April 2003 were studied. Patients were identified as hypouricemic when their serum uric acid (UA) level was less than 2.5 mg/dL (<149 mol/L) within 15 days after fever onset. Urine UA and creatinine levels were available for 43 patients; the serum cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423) were measured in 16 patients. Results: Sixteen patients (26.7%) had hypouricemia (UA, 1.68 \u060e 0.52 mg/dL [100 \u060e 31 mol/L]). No differences in age, sex, symptoms, vital signs, hemogram, or other biochemistry data existed between the hypouricemic and normouricemic groups. Fractional excretion (FE) of UA (FE UA ) in 12 hypouricemic patients was 39.6% \u060e 23.4%, significantly greater than that of 31 normouricemic patients (16.4% \u060e 11.4%; P < 0.0001). After adjustments for age and sex, high FE UA was significantly associated with the lowest blood oxygenation (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.001; r \u202b\u060d\u202c \u060a0.624). The number of catastrophic outcomes (endotracheal intubation and/or death) adjusted for older age and sex showed that hypouremic patients had an odds ratio of 10.57 (confidence interval, 2.33 to 47.98; P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.002). Kaplan-Meier curves for catastrophic outcome-free results showed significant differences between patients with normouricemia or hypouricemia (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.01). Serum IL-8 levels correlated significantly with FE UA (P < 0.001; r \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.785) and inversely with serum UA level (P \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.044; r \u202b\u060d\u202c \u060a0.509); neither IL-6 nor TNF-\u2423 level showed such correlations. Conclusion: One fourth of patients with SARS developed hypouricemia, which might result from a defect in renal UA handling and was associated with a high serum IL-8 level. Renal hypouricemia is an ominous sign in patients with SARS. Am J Kidney Dis 45:88 -95.",

However, we observed that the elevation in serum creatinine levels in patients with ARF was preceded by increased serum cytokine levels, indicating that proinflammatory cytokine-related renal lesions may have an important role. 4 Direct and indirect associations of viral infections with human renal diseases have been noted for years, 5 and several pathogenic mechanisms have been postulated as contributing to the renal diseases associated with viral infections. 6 Most virus-related renal diseases mainly involve glomeruli. However, lesions of the renal tubules and interstitium have been reported infrequently. 7 We showed interstitial infiltrations of inflammatory cells in renal histological specimens obtained at necropsy for 2 patients with SARS complicated by ARF. 4 Taking these observations together, we speculate that significant elevations in proinflammatory cytokine levels may have a pivotal role in renal injury in patients with SARS.",

The inverse correlation between serum UA level and FE UA indicates that the hypouricemia in patients with SARS resulted from an abnormal increase in UA excretion during SARS-CoV infection. Although SARS-CoV could be detected in patients' urine, most of the patients with SARS we studied had normal renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis has been associated with various viral infections, but not reported in SARS-CoV infection. We had reported 2 necropsy cases of patients with SARS with ARF and did not find glomerular or tubular lesions. 4 Several diseases or factors may cause renal hypouricemia, eg, obstructive jaundice, solid or hematologic neoplasias, diabetes mellitus, and drugs affecting urate homeostasis. 14 Renal hypouricemia associated with infections has been reported infrequently. 18,19 Although a substantial proportion of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have presented with renal hypouricemia, co-trimoxazole was thought to be a contributory factor. 19,20 Causes of renal hypouricemia in patients with other systemic infections are not known.",

Although proinflammatory cytokine data were obtained from a small proportion of our patients with SARS, it is interesting that serum IL-8 level correlated significantly with FE UA . It has been shown that proinflammatory cytokines can influence UA excretion 24 and modulate the activities of channels and transporters by various mechanisms. 25,26 To our knowledge, the effect of cytokines on urate transport has not been investigated. Previous reports indicated that the mean time for immunoglobulin G seroconversion of SARS-CoV occurs on day 10, 2 accompanied by a decline in serum levels of such proinflammatory cytokines as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u2423 in the convalescent stage. 27 Our study showed that the lowest serum UA level occurred days 7 to 9 after fever onset, when the cytokine storm of patients with SARS usually occurred. 27 Hypouricemia is a poor prognostic indicator in patients with intra-abdominal sepsis 18 or radiating pneumonitis. 28 In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with infections of the central nervous system, renal hypouricemia also is an ominous sign. 19 The present study shows that hypouricemic patients with SARS had a poor outcome, especially in terms of respiratory failure, compared with normouricemic patients. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves for catastrophic outcome-free results showed significant differences between patients with normouricemia or hypouricemia. In addition, FE UA correlated inversely with blood oxygenation. UA is the main metabolite of adenosine triphosphate degradation, and increased UA excretion has been observed in patients with respiratory failure. 29 However, in such patients, serum UA levels were not decreased or changed by treatment, 29 implicating increased UA production, rather than abnormal UA renal handling, in hypoxic patients. We speculate that both hypoxia and hypouricemia in patients with SARS indicate the severity of SARS-CoV infection, which affects both ventilation and UA excretion. In vivo and in vitro studies 30, 31 have shown UA to be an important antioxidant, contributing as much as 60% of free-radical scavenging in human serum. 32 A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that a nucleotide-supplemented diet could significantly reduce complications and shorten hospital stay after admission to an intensive care unit, 33 suggesting serum UA as a possible surrogate of antioxidant capacity. 34 It is not clear whether poor outcomes of hypouricemic patients with SARS are caused in part by a shortage of antioxidants.",
