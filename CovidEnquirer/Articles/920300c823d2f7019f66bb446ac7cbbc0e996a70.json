The effect of population vaccination is also considered. The proposed model can serve as a basis for the development of other algorithms to simulate real epidemics based on real data.",

Consequently, since the first years of the last century, an interdisciplinary effort to study the spreading of a disease in a social system has been made. In this sense, mathematical epidemiology is concerned with modeling the spread of infectious disease in a population. The aim is generally to understand the time course of the disease with the goal of controlling its spread. Such models are used, for example, to guide policy in vaccination strategies for childhood diseases.",

Nevertheless, the work due to Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (see [2] ) can be considered as the starting point for the design of modern mathematical models. It consists of a SIR model. Specifically, one can consider some types of mathematical models depending on the division of the population into classes. So, we have the SIR models where susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals are considered. The susceptible individuals are those capable to contracting the disease; the infected individuals are those capable of spreading the disease; and the recovered individuals are those immune from the disease, either died from the disease, or, having recovered, are definitely immune to it. For many infections there is a period of time during which the individual has been infected but is not yet infectious himself; during this latent period the individual is said to be exposed. In this case we have the SEIR model in which the new class of exposed individuals (E) must be considered. Some infections, for example the group of those responsible for the common cold, do not confer any long lasting immunity. Such infections do not have a recovered state and individuals become susceptible again after infection. Then we have the SIS models. Moreover, there are another variants of these models such as the SIRS model or the SEIRS model.",

Of special interest are the CA-epidemic proposals modeling the motion of individuals (see, for example [14] [15] [16] ). Roughly speaking, cellular automata are simple models of computation capable to simulate physical, biological or environmental complex phenomena. Consequently, several models based on such mathematical objects have been appeared in the literature to simulate growth processes, reaction-diffusion systems, self-reproduction models, epidemic models, forest fire spreading, image processing algorithms, etc. (see, for example, [17] ). Specifically, a two-dimensional CA is formed by a two-dimensional array of identical objects called cells, which are endowed with a state that changes in discrete steps of time according to a specific rule. As the CA evolves, the updated function (whose variables are the states of the neighbors cells) determines how local interactions can influence the global behaviour of the system.",

It is based on cellular automata, and three classes of population are considered: susceptible, infected and recovered. Furthermore, in each cell several individuals are considered instead of only one individual, as is stated in the majority of proposals appeared in the literature, since the proposed model try to simulate epidemic spreading in large regions. Consequently, each cell stands for an square portion of the land and its state is obtained from the fraction of the number of individuals which are susceptible, infected, or recovered from the disease.

The main goal of the model is to compute the factors S t ij , I t ij and R t ij . The local transition function used is the following: Eqs. (8) and (10) reflect that every loss in the infected population is due to a gain in the recovered population, while every gain in the infected population is due to a loss in the susceptible population. Roughly speaking, the Eq. (8) can be interpreted as saying that the portion of infected individuals of a cell (i, j) at a particular time step t is given by the portion of infected individuals which have not been recovered from the disease (first sum of the summation) and by the portion of susceptible individuals of the same cell at time t \u00c0 1 which have been infected by the infected individuals at time t \u00c0 1 of the cell (second sum of the summation) taking into account the virulence of the disease. Moreover, some susceptible individuals of the cell (i, j) can be infected by infected individuals of the neighbour cells which have travelled to the cell (third sum of the summation). Obviously, it depends on some parameters involving the virulence, the nature of the connections between the cells, the possibilities of an infected individual to be moved from one cell to another, and the relation between the population of the cells. Furthermore, Eq. (10) gives the portion of recovered individuals of the cell (i, j) at time t as the number of recovered individuals of the cell at the previous time step plus the fraction of infected individuals of the cell which have been recovered in one step of time.
