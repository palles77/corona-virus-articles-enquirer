For this purpose, we have analyzed the results of molecular dynamics simulations where all possible conformational and aggregational space was systematically explored. Two main assumptions were considered; the first is that protein E contains one transmembrane a-helical domain, with its N-and C-termini located in opposite faces of the lipid bilayer. The second is that protein E forms the same type of transmembrane oligomer and with identical backbone structure in different coronaviruses. The models arising from the molecular dynamics simulations were tested for evolutionary conservation using 13 coronavirus protein E homologous sequences. It is extremely unlikely that if any of our assumptions were not correct we would find a persistent structure for all the sequences tested. We show that a low energy dimeric, trimeric and two pentameric models appear to be conserved through evolution, and are therefore likely to be present in vivo. In support of this, we have observed only dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric aggregates for the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E in SDS. The models obtained point to residues essential for protein E oligomerization in the life cycle of the SARS virus, specifically N15. In addition, these results strongly support a general model where transmembrane domains transiently adopt many aggregation states necessary for function.",

Recently, one of its members has been found to be the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Rota et al., 2003) . Coronaviruses are surrounded by a lipid bilayer, or envelope, which typically embeds three proteins: spike (S), matrix (M), and the E protein. The envelope surrounds a nucleocapsid, containing the viral RNA and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Proteins S, M, and N have been studied for their important roles in receptor binding and virion budding. For example, the envelope spike protein S mediates attachment to cellular receptors and entry by fusion with cell membranes, whereas the matrix protein M is involved in budding and interacts with N and S proteins (Opstelten et al., 1995; Narayanan et al., 2000) .",

Additionally, although in many coronaviruses expression of M protein on its own is not sufficient to produce virus-like particles, coexpression of proteins M and E can readily produce them (Bos et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1996; Baudoux et al., 1998; Corse and Machamer, 2000) . Proteins M and E have been found to interact via their cytoplasmic domains in pre-Golgi compartments (Lim and Liu, 2001) . Another role suggested for protein E has been in promoting apoptosis (An et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2001) , an effect that can be opposed by Bcl-2. Further, recent data (Liao et al., 2004) suggests that SARS coronavirus E protein (SCoVE) can increase membrane permeability and may have ion channel activity.",

Another group (Maeda et al., 2001) has suggested that protein E in MHV traverses the lipid bilayer twice, whereby both N-and C-termini of the protein would reside in the cytoplasm, which is topologically equivalent to the interior of the viral envelope. Even more recently, based on in vitro biophysical studies (Arbely et al., 2004 ) a short hairpin (12 amino acids long) has been suggested for the putative transmembrane domain of SCoVE.",

We have then performed global searching molecular dynamics simulations (Adams et al., 1995) using only the transmembrane sequence of protein E (TME). As the oligomeric size of the hypothetic bundle is not known, we explored different oligomeric sizes, from dimers to hexamers. This procedure was performed on 13 different sequence variants, to select a model that would be evolutionarily conserved (Briggs et al., 2001) . The latter strategy has already been used successfully to predict correct models for transmembrane peptides known to form dimers (Briggs et al., 2001) , trimers (Kukol et al., 2002) , tetramers (Torres et al., 2002a,b) , or pentamers (Torres et al., 2002a) for which experimental data was available a priori, and the validity of the predictions could be readily assessed.

As described previously (Arkin et al., 1997) , the rotational orientation angle v is defined by the angle between a vector perpendicular to the helix axis, oriented toward the middle of the peptidic C\u00bcO bond of the residue, and a plane that contains both the helical axis and the normal to the bilayer. This angle is 0\u00b0when the residue is located in the direction of the tilt. For all representations in Figs. 3-5, the rotational orientation v was defined relative to residue 23, indicated as v 23 , in the sequence SCovE (see asterisk symbol in Fig. 2) , and its equivalent residue for other sequences. The tilt angle of the models, b, was taken as the average of the angles between each helix axis in the bundle and the bundle axis. The bundle axis, coincident with the normal to the bilayer, was calculated by CHI. The helix axis was calculated as a vector with starting and end points above and below a defined residue, where the points correspond to the geometric mean of the coordinates of the five a-carbons N-terminal and the five a-carbons C-terminal to the defined residue. Intersequence comparisons between low energy clusters were performed by calculating the RMSD between their a-carbon backbones. Fitting was performed using the program ProFit (http:// www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit). The energies calculated correspond to the total energy of the system, including both bonded, e.g., bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and nonbonded, i.e., van der Waals and electrostatic terms (Adams et al., 1995) .

We hypothesize that models A and B could represent closed (low energy) and open (high energy) forms of a channel (see Discussion). Slices through both structures are given in Fig. 6 (two columns on the right).",

Recent in vivo studies performed on the whole protein (Liao et al., 2004) also show dimers and trimers in nonreducing conditions, but only monomers in reducing conditions which prevent disulfide bond formation between monomers via the extramembrane cysteine residues (see Fig.  1 ). Overall, these combined results suggest that although the specificity in the interactions between monomers resides in the transmembrane domain, a dramatic effect on oligomerization is contributed by the extramembrane domain, specifically, but possibly not limited to, intermonomer disulfide bonds. In addition, the reported membrane permeabilizing activity of SCoVE (Liao et al., 2004) is consistent with our prediction of a pentameric bundle or pore, for which we find two close conformations, A and B. Although based on their energy values only model A appears to be correct, it is intriguing that the only persistent models found after a systematic search for a homopentamer should have the same handedness and helix tilt and be separated by a rotation of their helices of just 55\u00b0. We propose therefore that these two models could represent open and closed states of a channel, as both conformations should have been equally conserved during evolution. This is clearly reminiscent of phospholamban, where the possible existence of two transmembrane homopentameric models separated only by a rotation of their helices of ;40\u00b0has been discussed (Torres et al., , 2002a .",

Recently, this prediction was partially confirmed by the observation of a homotetrameric form of the cytoplasmic domain of CD3-z (Sigalov et al., 2004 ) that could only be detected at very high concentrations. As both CD3-z and protein E are targeted to lipid rafts, it is possible that the local increase in concentration catalyzes the formation of many types of oligomers.",

Our results implicitly support a topology for protein E where N-and C-termini are in opposite sides of the membrane (Corse and Machamer, 2000) . The latter authors showed unquestionably that the long hydrophilic tail (C-terminus) is facing the cytoplasm and therefore should be located in the inside of the virion envelope. Consistently, Raamsman et al. (2000) found that protein E was not digested after treating MHV particles with proteinase K in the absence of detergent. It was concluded that no part of protein E faces the virus exterior, although a question should be raised about the accessibility of such a small N-terminus to proteinase K (;10 amino acids, probably associated to the membrane). In fact, Yu et al. (1994) showed previously using an antibody against protein E in MHV that protein E was accessible from the surface of the virion envelope. Recently, Maeda et al. (2001) targeted a hydrophylic peptide (a flag) added to either the N-or the C-termini of protein E with antibodies and suggested that both N-and C-termini of the protein would reside in the cytoplasm, i.e., topologically equivalent to the virus lumen. These authors argued that an alternative explanation for the data reported by Corse and Machamer (2000) was that although both C and N are in the cytoplasmic domain, the N-terminus was simply too short to be targeted by the antibody. Even more recently, in vitro biophysical studies (Arbely et al., 2004) have led to the suggestion that the putative TM domain of protein E forms a short hairpin that inserts only partially in the membrane.",

These different structural models could arise in different environments. For example, many viral envelope proteins contain putative palmitoylated sites and it is thought that this modification is important in protein-protein interactions during virus assembly. Palmitoylation may also induce raft partitioning, as shown for example in HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Bhattacharya et al., 2004) . The cytoplasmic tail of SCovE, for example, contains one or more putative palmitoylation sites, and specifically, a ''double cysteine'' CC motif, which is a strong predictor of palmitoylation, as exemplified in various receptors (Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003) . In addition, in IBV (Corse and Machamer, 2002) and in MHV (Yu et al., 1994 ) protein E has already been shown to be palmitoylated. It is possible that this reversible covalent modification could trigger conformational changes critical for function. Physical interaction of this domain with the M protein is critical in the formation of the virion (Lim and Liu, 2001 ). An interesting possibility therefore is that palmitoylation and the subsequent close association of the cytoplasmic tail to the lipid bilayer may trigger a conformational change, or even the formation of a TM hairpin. Both in vitro and in vivo studies are currently being performed in our labs to test each of these hypotheses.",
