Comfortable indoor environment, safety, and reliability are some of the amenities valued by guests. However, little research has been published about the indoor air quality (IAQ) of hotel buildings up to now and most hotel managers often ignore these important issues [1, 2] . On the other hand, state-of-the-art technical infrastructure is typically utilized in hotels to provide high levels of comfort, especially thermal comfort. Nevertheless, using energy-intensive spaceconditioning systems does not warrant absolute guest's satisfaction [1, 3] . Guests frequently complain about thermal discomfort, even where expensive and sophisticated systems are operated. Complaints in hotels are most commonly related to uncomfortable air temperatures (too high or too low), and to the difficulty or impossibility of individual adjustment [3] . Moreover, space conditioning (heating, cooling, and ventilation for the purpose of maintaining high standards of air quality and thermal comfort) typically accounts for about half the total energy consumed in hotels [4, 5] . Hence, most hotel designers and managers always pay attention only to the energy consumption of hotels operation. Managers take the management of resources as a major role that inevitably leads to housekeeping's greater emphasis on those tasks with visual satisfaction. Nevertheless, hotels are public places accommodating a vast variety of international travellers; therefore the demand for good IAQ may be higher than for other types of buildings [6] .",

European Standardization Organization (CEN) has drafted several standards to help the member countries implementing the directive. One of these is the ''Indoor environmental input parameters for design and assessment of energy performance of buildings\", addressing IAQ, thermal environment, lighting and acoustics [11] . The standard specifies design values for indoor environment, values to be used in energy calculations, and methods to verify the specified indoor environment in the buildings [12] . However it does not establish a methodology for IAQ audits of buildings. Portugal, as one of the European Union member states, approved a series of national laws to implement the EPBD [13e15], stating simultaneously that IAQ monitoring of the existing non residential buildings is mandatory, under the rules of RSECE [14] . However, it is not the case for most of the member countries.",

However equations (2) and (3) apply to the case of a uni-zone room having air exchanges only with outdoor environment. In the present case, as the room door is very tight and the corridor is most of the time unoccupied, it was concluded that the studied room could be considered a uni-zone compartment. Regarding the uniformity of the distribution of the CO 2 concentration inside the room, it was not possible to put in practice, previous to the decay phase, the recommended procedure of using a fan during a short period to promote a good dilution, on account of the hotel guests privacy issues. Nevertheless, it was latter checked that in a similar room where an equilibrium concentration of 1100 ppm had been achieved after the sleeping period, the spatial variability of CO 2 concentration was in the order of AE15 ppm. In rooms where there is not a strong ventilation flow, spatial non-uniformities of CO 2 concentrations tend to be lower. A previous smoothing procedure may be recommended to minimize the disturbing influence of imprecision due to the fluctuating feature of the recorded C(t) data, as it is the case of gas analyzers with imprecision higher than AE30 ppm. Parameters were estimated by fitting the logarithm of the concentrations against time. Fig. 2 shows the first day evolution of CO 2 concentration in suite #620, before any remediation action. A curve fitting, with a linear law for a chosen concentration-decay period is shown in Fig. 3 , indicating an AER of 0.429 h \u00c01 . The value of AER estimated by this method was robust, i.e., regression achieved a correlation coefficient R \u00bc 0.9978, which means that conditions were quite stable. The represented decay period corresponds to a calm day with low wind velocity (v < 2 m/s), thus it represents the worst case regarding AER conditions in the studied room. It is seen from Table 3 that by the 0.429 h \u00c01 AER, the amount of fresh air (coming into the room by infiltration) provided to suite #620 in the considered decay period was 20 m 3 /h/person, which is lower than the minimum requirement stated by national IAQ regulation (RSECE [14] ) for design project of hotel rooms in new buildings which is 30 m 3 /h/occupant.",

In the present audit, besides the purge of the hot-water storage tank and the return collector, 1 L samples were collected from ten showers (in rooms selected randomly), plus one at each of the staff male and the female washrooms. The measured data for selected rooms are shown in Table 7 and these results indicate that the indoor air microbial pollution in guest rooms is well below the limit values. However, a generalized contamination by Legionella was detected in the hot-water circuit, although with no presence of the pathogenic species (Legionella pneumophila).

Yet IAQ affects occupant health, comfort, and productivity, and in some cases even building usability, all of which can have significant economic impacts for building owners/managers and occupants/guests. While hotel manager/owner and building professionals may recognize the importance of IAQ, they often do not acknowledge how design, construction decisions and control routines can result in IAQ problems. In addition, they may assume that achieving a high level of IAQ is associated with premium costs and novel or even risky technical solutions. In other cases, they may employ individual measures thought to provide good IAQ, such as increased outdoor air ventilation rates or specification of lower emitting materials, without a sound understanding of the project-specific impacts of these measures or a systematic assessment of IAQ priorities. On the other hand little research has been concerned to the IAQ of hotel buildings up to now.",
