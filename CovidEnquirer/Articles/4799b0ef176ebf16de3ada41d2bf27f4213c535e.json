The smoke from one village blows over the hills, pastures, and oceans only to be inhaled in distant villages. Health issues are no different. What happens in one nation or geographic area has repercussions for the health and well being of that region and potentially the whole global community. In veterinary medicine this concept is of critical importance in addressing transboundary diseases such as brucellosis, tuberculosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Infections with pandemic potential zoonotic diseases (SARS-severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, West Nile encephalitis, Lyme disease, echinococosis, anthrax), water toxicity due to pathogens, pesticides and chemicals, and more insidious infections such as human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis are examples of how health issues quickly become worldwide concerns.",

In recent years many factors, most notably concern about emerging infectious diseases, have contributed to an increasing appreciation of the interdependency of human, animal and ecosystem health worldwide. Integrated global approaches to improve the health of humans, animals and their shared environments are proving to be in the best interest of many countries. A special symposium and award were established in memoriam to the internationally renowned epidemiologist, Dr. Calvin W. Schwabe, who (while at the University of California, Davis) was a significant advocate of the ''One Medicine'' approach to public health, calling upon all health professionals, including veterinarians, to work collaboratively and comparatively to improve human health. This paper discusses the evolution of the ''One Medicine'' concept into a global ''One Health'' approach to research, training capacity and service infrastructure, focused not only on disease, but also on health at the individual, population, and ecosystem levels. Projects involving UCD faculty which attempt to integrate a One Health approach include the Health for Animals and Livelihood Improvement (HALI) Project in Tanzania, Envirovet Summer Institute, Avian Flu School and Newcastle Immunization Program in Africa, a web-based virtual global health training program, and the Calvin Schwabe One Health Project.",

Developing nations continue to struggle with problems related to rapid population growth, sanitation, adequate safe water, lack of sustainable agriculture and livestock, as well as access to quality health care. At the same time, the health problems in developed nations have shifted to chronic degenerative illnesses, escalating health care costs, and the use and misuse of technology. Global environmental changes, population growth and increasing international trade, have resulted in expansive, often rapid movement of people, pathogens, animal (livestock and wildlife) products and produce worldwide (Slingenbergh et al., 2004; Bender et al., 2006; Chomel, 2008) . Such movement creates enormous challenges for tracking and controlling pathogens (foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza viruses) and toxins (melamine and ethylene glycol) that threaten both human and animal health. Most countries, including the USA, are inadequately equipped to deal with diseases involving the humananimal interface and environmental change. The impact of these health problems on the world's poorest communities is even more profound, and many have just begun to be recognized.",

Health is an imperative for economic strength and prosperity. Improved health increases productivity, reduces the need for foreign aid, and creates greater demand for goods and services, thereby stimulating the global economy. By improving health and reducing human suffering we also contribute to political stability, making the world more secure. Now more than ever, transdisciplinary approaches are needed to solve these complex health problems at the human-animal-environmental interface. Facilitating the involvement of our global community, including universities, industry, governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and citizens, is the only approach that holds promise to improve global health.

In the 19th century Robert Virchow, the German physician and pathologist acknowledged that ''between animal and human medicine there is no dividing line, nor should there be. The object is different, but the experience obtained constitutes the basis of all medicine'' (Kahn et al., 2007) . Early in his medical career, Virchow's experimental studies on Trichinella spiralis, a helminth parasite of pigs, as well as bovine cysticercosis and tuberculosis lead him to coin the term ''zoonosis'' to describe pathogens such as these which are transmitted from animals to humans (Saunders, 2000) . In 1873 a young Canadian physician -Sir William Osler -went to study with Virchow in Germany and upon his return he was the first to establish the field of veterinary pathology as an academic discipline in a North American school of veterinary medicine. Osler was also the first to use the term ''One Medicine'' in the English language literature (Cardiff et al., 2008; Saunders, 1987) .",

            "text": "There are several notable examples of successful collaborations involving veterinary and medical scientists over the past 150 years that resulted in significant discoveries benefiting both human and animal health. In 1893, Theobald Smith and F.L. Kilbourne were the first to discover that arthropods could serve as vectors for pathogen transmission. They showed that Boophilus ticks transmitted the intra-erythrocytic protozoal parasite Babesia bigemina, which caused the severe, often fatal cattle disease known as redwater. Subsequently, their work lead to the discovery by Walter Reed that mosquitoes vector the virus responsible for yellow fever in humans (Wilkinson, 1992) . Another example of zoonotic disease discovery is Edward Jenner's famous observations on the exposure of milk maids to cowpox and their resistance to smallpox resulting in the first human smallpox vaccine (Baxby, 1996) . Similarly, Jenner's use of the first inactivated vaccine for hog cholera in pigs laid the foundation for the production of human typhus and polio vaccines (Kahn, 2006) . A more recent example of successful collaborative discovery is that of physician Rolf Zinkernagel and veterinarian Peter Doherty who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1996 for their pioneering work showing how the immune system distinguishes normal cells from virusinfected cells (Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1974) .",

Schwabe. Dr. Schwabe, the late veterinary epidemiologist and parasitologist organized and chaired the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis. During the second half of the 20th century Dr. Schwabe reintroduced the ''One Medicine'' concept in his book Veterinary Medicine and Human Health and is credited with renewing recognition that the ''cumulative effect of all practitioners of medicine is aimed at quality of human life and survival'' (Schwabe, 1984 ). Schwabe's presciently contended words that ''the critical needs of man include the combating of diseases, ensuring enough food, adequate environmental quality, and a society in which humane values prevail'' (Schwabe, 1984) are even more profound today. His vision that human and veterinary medical practitioners are obliged to work together in sharing information to ensure the physical, mental, social, economic and inner health for all life, have never been more important than it is now in our changing global environment.",

Arguably, the most notable is the intensive public interest focused on emerging infectious diseases in the past 20 years. Human infections with zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola and HIV which were originally derived from primates; Rift Valley fever virus and Mycobacterium bovis (one cause of human tuberculosis) from livestock and wildlife; hantavirus, Yersinia pestis (cause of plague) and Borrelia burgdorferi (cause of Lyme disease) transmitted from wild rodents; Hendra, Nipah and rabies viruses from bats and domestic animals; and most recently, avian influenza virus H5N1 and mosquito-vectored encephalitis viruses such as West Nile virus from birds are of great concern to both public and animal health professionals, scientists and policy makers (Bengis et al., 2004; Brown, 2004; King et al., 2004; Torres-V\u00e9 lez and Brown, 2004; Kahn, 2006) . There is also an increasing awareness that a variety of protozoal parasites (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Toxoplasma, Entamoeba histolytica), bacteria (Salmonella, Vibrio cholera, Listeria, Escherichia coli 0157:H7) and viruses (Hepatitis E virus, Coxsachievirus B5, Norovirus) derived from wildlife and/ or domestic animals are transmitted to humans via food or water (Schlundt et al., 2004; Dubey and Jones, 2008) . In addition, bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE), referred to as Mad Cow Disease, attracted global attention when it was first discovered in 1986 and soon thereafter was recognized as a zoonotic prion disease, when evidence emerged that the human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) epidemic in the United Kingdom was associated with the consumption of BSE-infected beef. Human diseases caused by these zoonotic agents and others have focused faculty and student research interests on the interrelated factors of land and water use change, natural resource management (including wildlife conservation and livestock production), and human population behaviors that may alter the emergence and spread of zoonotic disease agents.",

            "text": "Animal and human health specialists are particularly interested in the interface of humans, wildlife and domestic animals in shared ecosystems because zoonotic agents are the most significant pathogens associated with emerging infectious diseases. Zoonotic pathogens account for 61% of the infectious organisms that cause illness in people, and are twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases as pathogens that are not zoonotic (Taylor et al., 2001) . Thus, domestic animals, wildlife and arthropod vectors are an important part of the public health picture, being integral to the ecology of many of the infectious diseases currently important to society. In addition to infectious disease, the veterinary and public health professions are called upon to solve environmental (ecosystem) health problems involving the management of agricultural byproducts, environmental contaminants, and air and water quality. The rapidly increasing human population, along with the industry, agriculture, and commerce needed to sustain it, has dramatically expanded the rural-urban interface, accelerating the movement of pathogens and pollutants among people and animals. In addition, the influx of human-generated toxins and chemicals seriously erodes the health and vitality of animal populations and communities. The challenge of sustaining healthy ecosystems defies simple solutions and narrow approaches. Pathogens, toxins, and environmental change are taking an increasing toll on the health of ecosystems. Although the problems are complex, they all point to one conclusion.",

As water becomes more and more scarce, animals and people are forced into smaller and smaller workable areas. Contact among infected animals and people then increases, facilitating infection transmission. When this situation is complicated by co-infection with HIV/AIDS, the results can be catastrophic to families and whole communities due to the increased susceptibility of immunosuppressed individuals to severe disease caused by pathogens such as M. bovis and Cryptospridium spp., which are better controlled by those with a healthier immune response.",

It is likely that the requisite sharing of diminishing water sources in rural Tanzania is increasing infection transmission and illness in livestock, wildlife, and people; reducing livestock productivity; and even impacting nonagricultural means of livelihood improvement, such as wildlife tourism. By determining zoonotic disease presence and prevalence in domestic animal and wildlife populations in areas of ample available water as compared to areas of water restriction, Tanzanian scientists are collecting critical data, necessary to develop socioeconomic and health models of zoonotic disease impacts. Detailed analyses of these models allow for the development of targeted management recommendations to improve wildlife conservation, water management, public health policy, and agricultural development. The HALI Project is led by Sokoine University of Agriculture, UC Davis Wildlife Health Center, Wildlife Conservation Society and the University of Vermont, with intellectual and financial support from the Global Livestock Collaborative Research Support Program of the United States Agency for International Development. Collaborative support is also provided to this project by the National Institute of Medical Research in Tanzania with medical researchers involved in the socioeconomic health surveys being conducted at the village level as well as in the investigation of tuberculosis transmission to humans. Although HALI is in its initial phases, bovine tuberculosis (M. bovis) has already been identified in cattle from which people are consuming raw products and from wildlife that share common water sources and habitat, as well as range into the national park, potentially exposing wildlife, one of Tanzania's most valuable resources, to this populationlimiting disease. (Beasley, 1993) . The intensive Summer Institute builds expertise to protect biodiversity and health with a focus on emerging and infectious diseases, chemical contaminants, climate change, and habitat degradation. Envirovet's main objective is to create an international cadre of scientists with the unique perspectives, knowledge, skills, and expertise to address complex issues in ecosystem health, conservation and emerging infectious diseases. The diverse faculty comes from around the globe, with the terrestrial ecosystem health and developing country instruction being led by UC Davis faculty, Drs. Kirsten Gilardi and Deana Clifford. Envirovet 2008 provided seven weeks of lecture, laboratory, and field experiences to 31 (11 male; 20 female) participants from eight countries (Canada, India, Nigeria, Uganda, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Mexico and the USA) in the areas of terrestrial and aquatic wildlife and ecosystem health, addressing both developed and developing country issues. Each participant engaged in comprehensive classroom, laboratory, and field interactions, totaling 60-70 h per week. Participants were linked to cutting-edge leaders in a wide variety of relevant disciplines. A strong emphasis was placed on collaborations to address health problems at the animal (livestock and wildlife) and human interface which occurred both in natural areas and areas devoted to agriculture, forestry, mining, urban development, and other forms of human enterprise.",

Students also directly participated in HALI project research activities which included testing cattle for bovine tuberculosis and sampling of water for fecally transmitted protozoal and bacterial pathogens to evaluate the prevalence of zoonotic disease at the interface between wildlife, livestock and human populations. At Sokoine University of Agriculture, students learned how to properly handle, test and necropsy chickens in case of a suspected outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. They received lectures from Tanzanian scientists involved in a recent Rift Valley fever outbreak as well as those working with medical researchers to access the impact of bovine tuberculosis transmission to human populations and evaluate the use of rats to diagnose human tuberculosis from bronchial swabs. Current research and innovative methods being developed in Tanzania for diagnosis and surveillance were emphasized in lectures, laboratories and discussions. Pollution problems and the latest research in freshwater and marine ecosystems were highlighted through discussions and field exercises at the Sokoine University, as well as at the Institute for Marine Sciences on Zanzibar.

Therefore, technology may have to be employed in an attempt to simulate these experiences. The article's first author (PC) was fortunate to work with Dave Hird, the 2008 recipient of the Calvin W. Schwabe Award, to develop a computerized case-based CD-ROM (CD) designed to give veterinary students an opportunity to ''virtually'' work along-side veterinarians as they tried to solve challenging health problems relating to tuberculosis in South African wildlife, bovine abortion in Mexico and neurologic disease caused by plant toxins in Rapa Nui, Chile. Each of the three case modules presented, in a highly interactive format, a problem or mystery that must be solved by the learner. As well as acquiring information by video clips and text about the specific health problem, learners obtained information about the different countries, language and social customs, wildlife and livestock management practices, diagnostic methods, related disease control issues, economic factors, human health risks and the opinions of local experts. After assimilating this information, the learner was required to define the problem and formulate an action plan to confirm the diagnosis or make appropriate health recommendations. The computerized program invoked three adult education principles; active learning, learner-centered education and experiential learning and thereby served as an efficient learning tool and template for developing other case-based, problem solving computerized programs. Individual cases or their component parts, such as videos and animations, developed for this program are freely available and have been used by others in courses offered online and in the classroom as well as for auto-tutorial instruction. The program is accessible on the Web at: http://calf.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/html/International_web/ international_menu.html.",

The AFS course is designed to be adaptable to different countries and environmental conditions. AFS curriculum has been utilized in courses in over 15 countries by the staff that includes both MD and DVM trained specialists working together.",

Poultry is a vital resource for rural families and communities across Africa, particularly for the poor. Improving poultry health and production at the village level has tremendous potential to improve the livelihoods and the health of some of the poorest and most undernourished people on earth. In general, women and children raise chickens, ducks, guinea fowl and other poultry for the family and market, putting them at greatest risk for acquiring zoonotic infections, like influenza. In addition, poor poultry production has limited the contribution of domestic fowl to rural livelihoods. This project aims to both assess and improve biosecurity practices at the village or community level through education, outreach and vaccination of chickens for Newcastle disease. Data collection at the rural village level is assessing changes in poultry health and productivity and biosecurity practices. Already, dramatic increases in poultry production have been achieved through the very inexpensive vaccination for Newcastle disease; families who rarely ate eggs or chicken before, opting to sell the few eggs they produced, now have animal protein in their diets with plenty of eggs remaining to sell at market. This project aims to develop a model village and market to demonstrate the potential for sustainable Newcastle disease vaccination programs, improving health and livelihoods while creating awareness about transmission of diseases like highly pathogenic avian influenza.",

The project's over arching goal is to provide focused educational opportunities and career transitioning experiences for a new 'cadre' of veterinary medical students, who are prepared to work with human health specialists on global health problems that affect both humans and animals. UC Davis is particularly well suited to support this transdisciplinary research and training project, with schools of veterinary and human medicine as well as management and education, colleges of agriculture and natural resources, letters and science and engineering, the Watershed Institute and the John Muir Institute for the Environment all on one campus, which provides for greater collaborative opportunities and potential linkages with the project. By creating opportunities to support increased communication, interaction and collaboration, the project aims to synergize the critical and innovative thinking of individuals from diverse disciplines and focus their attention on solving challenging global health problems. Within the School of Veterinary Medicine, the project strives to;",

The newly formed University of California Global Health Institute will include a One Health Center of Expertise (co-lead by faculty at the Davis and Riverside campuses). The mission of the Center is to train global health leaders in a transdisciplinary, action-oriented approach to solving problems that affect human, animal (both domestic and wildlife) and ecosystem health globally with a particular focus on those affecting underserved populations of the world. Today's 'One Health' professional is likely to find this perspective and skill set applicable at every level of the private or public health sector as well as in academia. 'One Health' concepts must be integrated into our global health and veterinary curricula to ensure that our graduates, both academic and professional, are prepared to excel in this new and complex global community in which the health of domestic animals, wildlife, people and the environment are interdependent.",
