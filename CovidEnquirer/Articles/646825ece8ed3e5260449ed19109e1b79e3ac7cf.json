            "text": "The use of transgenic plants as vaccine production systems was described recently. We report on the immunological response elicited by two recombinant versions of the glycoprotein S from the swine-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) expressed in transgenic plants. Arabidoposis plants were genetically transformed with cDNAs constructs encoding either the N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1\u00b1750) or the full-length glycoprotein S of TGEV, responsible for the neutralizing antibody induction against the virus, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter. Genomic DNA and mRNA analyses of leaf extracts from transformed plants demonstrated the incorporation of the foreign cDNA into the arabidopsis genome, as well as their transcription. Expression of recombinant polypeptides were observed in most transgenic plants by ELISA using specific antibodies. Mice immunized with leaf extracts from transgenic plants developed antibodies that reacted specifically with TGEV in ELISA, immunoprecipitated the virus-induced protein, and neutralized the virus infectivity. From these results, we conclude that transgenic plants expressing glycoprotein S polypeptides may possibly be used as a source of recombinant antigen for vaccine production.",

Protective immunity against this disease must be developed in pregnant sows to confer passive protection to the piglets through colostrum and milk. Neutralizing antibodies against the virus are directed mainly to glycoprotein S (Garwes et al., 1978; Jimenez et al., 1986) , and relevant epitopes in neutralization have been mapped into the N-terminal domain of this protein . Four major antigenic sites have been described in glycoprotein S, of which site A is the immunodominant (De Diego et al., 1992; Delmas et al., 1990; Sa \u00c2 nchez et al., 1990) . Glycoprotein S from TGEV has been expressed using different vectors with tropism that favored antigenic presentation in the mucosal surfaces (Smerdou et al., 1996; Torres et al., 1995) . These vaccination approaches promoted systemic and mucosal antibody induction and, in the case of adenovirus vector, conferred protection to suckling piglets (Torres et al., 1996) .",

The concept of vaccine production in transgenic plants was first introduced by Mason et al. in 1992 . Proteins involved in protective immune response can be produced at a low cost and easily purified from plant extracts for parental inoculation. In addition, oral immunization by edible vaccines produced in transgenic plants could stimulate immune responses at the portal entrance of many pathogens, facilitating the design of large-scale immunization programs. The presence of specific antigens into plants, even at low levels, can raise by the oral route immune reactions comparable to those raised by conventional vaccines (Haq et al., 1995; Mason et al., 1996) .",

Additionally, rabies virus glycoprotein was expressed in transgenic tomatoes, but the immune response induced by administration of these plants to animals was not tested (McGarvey et al., 1995) . In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of expressing the glycoprotein S from TGEV in transgenic plants, as well as the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the plant-derived protein. The S protein is an excellent model for developing oral vaccines against enteric pathogens of mammals because of its immunogenicity and resistance to degradation in the gut.",

Expression in eukaryotic hosts is required for antigenic determinants that are dependent on glycosylation. Of the three major antigenic sites defined on glycoprotein S involved in the induction of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies, sites A and B are complex, conformational, and glycosylation dependent. Site D can be represented by synthetic peptides, although glycosylation has a minor effect on its conformation (Gebauer et al., 1991) . Several genetically engineered vaccines using prokaryotic vectors have failed against TGEV. Glycoprotein S expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and used to inoculate animals did not induce neutralizing antibodies or confer protection in vivo (Hu et al., 1987) .",

Glycosylation in plants may differ in the extent of glycosylation, processing, or both of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains (Faye et al., 1993) . Furthermore, the complex glycans of plants are often smaller than those of animals, in part due to the absence of sialic acid (Faye et al., 1993) . The only precedent of a glycoprotein expressed in plants for vaccine development is the glycoprotein G of rabies virus (McGarvey et al., 1995) . This protein expressed in tomato plants showed a molecular mass \u03f34 and \u03f36 kDa less than that obtained from virus-infected cells but still larger than the protein size predicted for the unglycosylated polypeptide chain (McGarvey et al., 1995) . The molecular mass of glycoprotein S expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana could not be determined because we were not able to detect the recombinant protein on Western blotting. However, antigenic determinants with strong dependence of glycosylation seem to be preserved because the plant-derived antigens induced neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals, indicating that critical antigenic sites are at least in part correctly glycosylated in plants.",

Coated ELISA plates with 100 l of PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 g of virus were blocked as described above with 5% fetal bovine serum, and after washing of the plates six times, sera diluted 1:10 in PBS\u00b1Tween 20 were added (100 l per well) and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, plates were washed again to remove unbound antibodies, and goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:500) were added to reveal immunocomplexes. After being washed and developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate as described above, reaction was stopped with 2 N H 2 SO 4 , and plates were read at 492 nm.",

            "text": "Schematic structure of the binary plasmids pRoK I and II used for Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. The DNA sequences encoding for the full-length or N-terminal domain of glycoprotein S from TGEV are cloned downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter in recombinant pRoK plasmids, followed by the nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator. These plasmids contain the left (LB) and right (RB) borders of transferred DNA that demarcate the sequences that are incorporated into the plant genome.FIG. 2. Characterization of transgenic plants transformed with pRoK I (1\u00b14), pRoK II (5\u00b18), or pRoK 2 (9) plasmids. (A) Presence of the recombinant genes in representative transgenic arabidopsis plants detected by PCR. C, control amplification of the same DNA fragment from pRoK II. (B) Foreign gene transcription in representative transformed plants analyzed by RT-PCR. Samples were treated or not with RNase to assess the DNA specificity of the reactions. C, same analyses in arabidopsis plants transformed with pRoK 2 plasmid.",

(A) ELISA titers of sera from mice inoculated with plant extracts expressing the N-terminal (mice 1\u00b14) or the full-length glycoprotein S (mice 5\u00b18). Titers are referred to the ELISA values obtained with the serum from a mouse immunized with a pRoK 2 transformed plant extract. (B) Kinetic of antibody induction against glycoprotein S in a mouse (mouse 3) after one, two, and three immunization doses (15, 30, and 45 days postinoculation, respectively) analyzed by immunoprecipitation of the glycoprotein S induced by TGEV in infected cells. An anti-glycoprotein S (anti-gS) serum was used as immunoprecipitation control. (C) Neutralization indexes of sera from immunized mice with plant extracts expressing the N-terminal (mice 1\u00b14) or full-length glycoprotein S (mice 4\u00b18). The neutralization index is defined as the ratio between the log of virus titer in the presence of a control mouse serum and sera from mice immunized with transgenic plants expressing the antigens (1\u00b18) or transformed with pRoK 2 (Arabidopsis). A rabbit anti-TGEV serum (anti-TGEV) showing high neutralization titer was also used as positive control. ELISA and neutralization index values are the mean of three independent experiments.",

The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Denaturation of RNA\u00b1cDNA hybrids and inactivation of the reverse transcriptase were done by boiling the reaction for 5 min. To the RT mixture, we added 50 pM concentration of the above mentioned sense primer and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (GIBCO BRL). This reaction spe-cifically amplifies a 197-bp fragment of the glycoprotein S gene. Treatments of purified RNA samples with RNase (Promega) were carried out with 10 units of the enzyme for 15 min at 20\u00b0C.",
