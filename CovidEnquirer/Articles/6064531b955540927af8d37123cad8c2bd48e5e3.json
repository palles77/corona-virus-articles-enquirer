Diseases caused by organic dusts are not included among the pneumoconioses and, in medicolegal practice at least, the presence of dust alone is insufficient to indicate pneumoconiosis: for compensation to be considered, the mineral dust must alter the structure of the lung and cause disability. The British Industrial Injuries Advisory Council defined pneumoconiosis as 'permanent alteration of lung structure due to the inhalation of mineral dust and the tissue reactions of the lung to its presence, excluding bronchitis and emphysema' . 4 Parkes recommends that cancer and asthma caused by mineral dust should also be excluded from the definition, an opinion with which we concur. 5 ",

Larger or denser particles impact or precipitate on the walls of the conductive airways and are rapidly removed by ciliary action. Smaller particles may reach the alveoli but do not sediment so readily and many are therefore exhaled. Very small particles are deposited on the walls of alveoli by diffusion but because they are so small the total amount of dust deposited in this way is insignificant compared with that deposited by sedimentation ( Fig. 7.1. 2). Direct measurement shows that most lung dust (96%) has a particle diameter less than 2.5 \u00b5m. 6 Fibrous dust particles behave differently. Fibres over 100 \u00b5m in length may reach the alveoli if they are very thin and remain aligned with the air stream. Fibre penetration is inversely related to path length and the number of bifurcations. 7 Tall people have longer conductive airways and experience more deposition in these sites than short people who have greater alveolar deposition for the same level of exposure. 8 Slightly more dust is deposited in the right lung than the left, probably because the right main bronchus is more in line with the trachea, and is broader and shorter than the left, and carries 55% of the inhaled air. 9, 10 Dust clearance from the lung Inhaled dust that settles in the conductive airways is removed within a day or two by ciliary action. Only dust that reaches the alveoli is liable to cause pneumoconiosis and much of this is also removed, but the clearance rate here is much slower: many coalminers continue to expectorate mine dust years after retirement.

Some free dust enters through the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue 11, 12 and some is taken up by, or pierces, the alveolar epithelium ( Fig. 1.34 , p. 21). [14] [15] [16] Some of this is transported within hours to the hilar lymph nodes. 17 So rapid is this translocation that it is thought not to involve most, the lesions are more numerous and better developed in the upper lobes than the bases but the reverse is true of asbestosis. The reasons for this are complex but undoubtedly involve the dust deposition:clearance ratio for the effect of the dust will depend upon both its amount and the duration of its stay in the lungs. There are well-recognised regional differences in the distribution and clearance of inhaled material, which in turn are dependent upon man's upright posture, the consequent gravitational forces being maximal at the apices. 35 When standing at rest, the apices of the lungs are hardly perfused, so that lymph formation and clearance are much better at the bases. [36] [37] [38] Similarly, the apices are relatively less well aerated; alveoli in the lower lobes receive more air than those in the upper lobes. 37, 39 The greater respiratory excursions at the bases are thought to promote macrophage mobility there. It is to be expected therefore that the bases would both receive and clear more dust than the apices, rendering it difficult to predict on theoretical grounds which parts of the lungs carry the heaviest dust burden. In fact, more dust of all types is found in the upper lobes, the part most severely affected by every type of pneumoconiosis except asbestosis. 40, 41 The predilection of asbestos to affect the periphery of the lower lobes is attributed to the dangerous long asbestos fibres preponderating there. 41, 42 Pulmonary reactions to mineral dust",

Occasionally, stains can be used to identify minerals, e.g. a modified Perls' reaction for inhaled iron, and Irwin's aluminon stain for aluminium, but these too have largely been replaced by modern analytical techniques. Ultrafine dust particles are particularly liable to be transported across the alveolar epithelium. 11 The integrity of the alveolar epithelium is very important to dust translocation from the air spaces to the interstitium. Much more dust reaches the interstitium if the epithelium is damaged. 18, 19 It is widely thought that macrophages that have left the interstitium for the alveolar space never return, 17, 20 but this is probably untrue. 21 Heavily laden macrophages accumulate in alveoli bordering the terminal and respiratory bronchioles, eventually filling them completely. Erosion of the alveolar epithelium permits re-entry of these macrophages into the interstitium, 22 very close to foci of bronchial mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which are found near the terminal bronchioles. 23 These aggregates guard the mouths of lymphatics, which commence at this point; alveoli are devoid of lymphatics. Dustladen interstitial macrophages accumulate in and around the bronchial MALT, which Macklin therefore referred to as dust sumps. 24 Most pneumoconiotic lesions are found in the region of the dust sumps and are therefore focal. Asbestosis is diffuse rather than focal because the long asbestos fibres are not readily mobilised and cannot be concentrated in the centriacinar dust sumps. This is also seen on occasion with platy non-fibrous dusts such as talc, mica, kaolinite and feldspar. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Within the dust sumps the dust particles are not static. They are constantly being freed and reingested by interstitial macrophages and, because these cells are mobile, successively inhaled dusts soon become intimately mixed. 34 Macrophages play an important role in pneumoconiosis and if the dust is fibrogenic the repeated phagocytosis of indestructible mineral particles results in constant fibroblast stimulation.",

Alternatively, elemental analysis may be undertaken with either energy-dispersive or wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. With energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, all elements of atomic number above 11 are identified, whilst with wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy the section can be scanned for one particular element. With the former technique different elements are shown graphically as individual peaks, the heights of which are proportional to the amounts of the different elements within the particle studied, thereby giving information on probable molecular formula ( Fig. 7.1.6) . Thus, different silicates can be distinguished from each other and also from silica, which registers as pure silicon, oxygen (atomic number 8) not being detected. The fact that the elements of low atomic number that constitute organic chemicals are not detected means that any minerals present (except beryllium, atomic number 4) can be recognised easily in tissue sections. Only particles can be analysed however: elements present in only molecular amounts cannot be detected by X-ray analysis.",

Micro-Raman spectroscopy is also useful in this respect. Some metals cause hypersensitivity, which can be identified by exposing the patient's lymphocytes to metals and measuring their reaction in vitro. 52 Radiological grading of pneumoconiosis A scheme for grading pneumoconiosis radiologically by comparison with standard radiographs has been adopted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and is widely used. 53 Small opacities (up to 1 cm diameter) are graded by their profusion, 1, 2 and 3 indicating increasing numbers, and by their size, increasing through p, q and r if rounded and s, t and u if irregular. Type p opacities are described as punctiform and measure up to 1.5 mm in diameter; larger lesions up to 3 mm in diameter (type q) are described as micronodular or miliary; and those over 3 mm and up to 1 cm in diameter (type r) are described as nodular. Irregular opacities cannot be sized so accurately, s, t and u indicating fine, medium and coarse respectively. Large opacities (over 1 cm diameter) are graded by their combined size, increasing through A, an opacity measuring between 1 and 5 cm in diameter; B, one or more opacities whose combined area does not exceed the equivalent of one-third of the area of the right lung field (when they are regrouped in the mind's eye or measured with a transparent ruler); and C, one or more opacities whose combined area exceeds one-third of the area of the right lung field (when similarly regrouped). In coalworkers, small opacities (up to 1 cm diameter) correspond to simple coalworker's pneumoconiosis and large opacities (over 1 cm diameter) to complicated coalworker's pneumoconiosis, which is also known as progressive massive fibrosis.",

As long ago as the sixteenth century in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jachymov, Czech Republic), diseases of miners' lungs were attributed to the dust the miners breathed. Silicosis, tuberculosis and lung cancer are all now known to have been prevalent among the miners in this region, the cancer being largely attributable to the high level of radioactivity in the mines. Silicosis was recognised in the UK soon after the discovery in 1720 that the addition of calcined flint to the clay from which china is made produced a finer, whiter and tougher ware. The preparation and use of this flint powder were highly dangerous, causing the condition known as potter's rot, one of the first of the many trade names by which silicosis has since been known. Aluminium oxide (alumina) now provides a safe, effective substitute for flint in this industry.",

However, silicosis still occurs in some miners, tunnellers, quarrymen, stone dressers and metal workers. Silica in one form or another is used in many trades -in the manufacture of glass and pottery, in the moulds used in iron foundries, as an abrasive in grinding and sandblasting, and as a furnace lining that is refractory to high temperatures. Rocks such as granite and sandstone are siliceous and their dusts are encountered in many mining and quarrying operations. In coal mining in the UK the highest incidence of the disease was in pits where the thinness of the coal seams required the removal of a large amount of siliceous rock, a process known as 'hard heading' . In South Africa, silicosis causes a high mortality among the gold miners on the Witwatersrand, where the metallic ore is embedded in quartz. Slate is a metamorphic rock that contains both silica and silicates, and slateworkers develop both silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. 55, 56 Nor are rural industries immune from the disease, particularly if ventilation is inadequate, as it is in certain African huts where stone implements are used to pound meal and the occupants develop mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. 57 Silicosis and mixed-dust pneumoconiosis have also been reported in dental technicians. 58 Desert sand is practically pure silica but the particles are generally too large to reach the lungs. However, silicosis has been reported in inhabitants of the Sahara, Libyan and Negev deserts and those living in windy valleys high in the Himalayan mountains, [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] whilst in California the inhalation of dust raised from earth has led to silicate pneumoconiosis in farm workers, 66 horses 67 and a variety of zoo animals. 68 The silica in rocks such as granite, slate and sandstone is largely in the form of quartz and this is therefore the type of silica encountered in most of the industries considered above. Cristobalite and tridymite, which are possibly even more fibrogenic than quartz, are more likely to be encountered in the ceramic, refractory and diatomaceous earth industries where processing involves high temperatures.",

Such 'acute silicosis' was observed in the scouring powder industry in the 1930s when these cleansing agents consisted of ground sandstone mixed with a little soap and washing soda. 69, 70 The additives were considered to have rendered the silica in the sandstone more dangerous but it is possible that the rapidity of onset of the disease merely reflected the intensity of the dust cloud to which the packers were exposed. Confusingly, the term 'acute silicosis' has since been applied to a further effect of heavy dust exposure in tunnellers, sand blasters and silica flour workers, namely pulmonary alveolar lipoproteinosis (see below), 71, 72 whilst the terms 'accelerated silicosis' or 'cellular phase silicosis' have been substituted for 'acute silicosis' in referring to the rapid development of early cellular lesions. 43, 73 The time from first exposure to the development of symptoms (the latency period) is inversely proportional to the exposure level. However, it is evident that a certain amount of silica can be tolerated in the lungs without fibrosis developing, indicating either a time factor in the pathogenetic process or a threshold dust load that has to be reached before fibrosis develops.",

            "text": "Silica particles that are roughly spherical in shape and of a diameter in the range of 1-5 \u00b5m sediment out in the alveoli and are concentrated within macrophages at Macklin's dust sumps, as explained previously (see p. 27). Early lesions, as seen in so-called accelerated or cellular phase silicosis, consist of collections of macrophages separated by only an occasional wisp of collagen. The early lesions have been likened to granulomas and on occasion have been mistaken for Langerhans cell histiocytosis or a storage disorder, but Langerhans cells are scanty and the histiocytes contain dust particles rather than accumulated lipid or polysaccharide. The macrophages of the early lesion are gradually replaced by fibroblasts and collagen is laid down in a characteristic pattern. The mature silicotic nodule is largely acellular and consists of hyaline collagen arranged in a whorled pattern, the whole lesion being well demarcated ( Fig. 7.1.8 ) and sometimes calcified. Small numbers of birefringent crystals are generally evident within the nodules when polarising filters are used, but these mainly represent silicates such as mica and talc, inhaled with the silica. Silica particles are generally considered to be only weakly birefringent, 43 but fairly strong birefringence is evident in strong light (see above). 44 Silicotic nodules develop first in the hilar lymph nodes and are generally better developed there than in the lungs. [74] [75] [76] Indeed, silicotic nodules are occasionally found in the hilar lymph nodes of persons who have no occupational history of exposure to silica and whose lungs are free of such lesions, the silica in the nodes being presumed to represent inhaled particles derived from quartz-rich soil. 77 Severely affected lymph nodes often calcify peripherally, giving a characteristic eggshell-like radiographic pattern. This is sometimes the only radiological abnormality. 76 Such enlarged lymph nodes may occasionally press upon and obstruct adjacent large bronchi 78 or result in a left recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, 79 so simulating malignancy. 80 Sometimes the nodules develop within the walls of major bronchi, occasionally causing a middle-lobe syndrome (see p. 92). 81 Silicotic nodules are also found along the lines of the pleural lymphatics 75, 82 where they have been likened to drops of candle wax on the visceral pleura. Very rarely, silica-induced fibrosis is more pronounced in the pleura than in the lungs. 83 Lung tissue between the nodules is often quite normal and not until the process is very advanced is there any disability ( Fig. 7. 1.9B). In severe cases large masses of fibrous tissue are formed, which may undergo central necrosis and cavitation ( Fig. 7.1.10 ). 84 On close inspection it is evident that these consist of conglomerations of many silicotic nodules closely packed together. In such severe cases cor pulmonale develops. Occasionally, silicotic nodules develop in the abdominal as well as the thoracic lymph nodes, and in the liver, spleen, peritoneum and bone marrow. [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] In about 10% of cases, the typical pulmonary nodules that predominantly affect the upper lobes are accompanied by diffuse fibrosis that is maximal in the lower lobes. 27, 33, [90] [91] [92] The latter may show 'honeycombing' and closely resemble idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The association is too common to be explained by chance and the diffuse fibrosis is therefore regarded as a further manifestation of the pneumoconiosis, possibly due to an interaction between the dust and the immunological factors discussed below.",

An early theory held that the hardness of the silica was responsible, but this was discounted by the observation that silicon carbide (carborundum) is harder than silica but is non-fibrogenic. Theories based on the piezoelectric property and on the solubility of silica were successively abandoned although the latter had a long period of popularity. It gained support from Kettle's experiments which showed that fibrosis developed about chambers placed in an animal's peritoneal cavity if the chambers contained silica powder sealed in by a collodion membrane through which solutes such as silicic acid could pass. However, it was later shown that the pores in a collodion membrane are quite irregular in size and when the experiments were repeated using chambers guarded by millipore membranes, no fibrosis developed, despite solutes being able to diffuse out. 93 The solubility theory also fails to take account of the differing fibrogenicity of the various forms of silica despite them being of similar solubility. 54 Furthermore, if the outer, more soluble layer of the particles is removed by etching, fibrogenicity is increased although solubility is decreased. In line with this, freshly fractured crystalline silica is more pathogenic in every respect than its aged equivalent, 94 which may partly explain the severity of silicosis in trades such as sandblasting. These observations suggest that the fibrogenicity of silica is connected with its surface configuration.",

            "text": "It is now known that uptake of the silica by macrophages is necessary for silicosis to develop. If silica and macrophages are enclosed together in peritoneal millipore chambers, a soluble product of the macrophages diffuses out and causes fibrosis. This observation led to the realisation that the fibrogenicity of the various crystalline forms of silica correlated well with their toxicity to macrophages and for a time macrophage death was thought to be necessary. 95 It is now considered that before the macrophages are killed by the ingested silica, they are stimulated to secrete factors that both damage other con stituents of the lung and promote fibrosis. [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is one fibrogenic factor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of silicosis. [103] [104] [105] Toxic damage to macrophages is due to silica particles injuring the phagolysosomal membranes, so releasing acid hydrolases into the cytoplasm. 95 It is important in the pathogenesis of the disease indirectly because when the macrophage crumbles, the silica particles are taken up by fresh macrophages and the fibrogenic process continues. It has been suggested that early involvement of the hilar lymph nodes in the fibrogenic process promotes the development of the disease in the lung by delaying dust clearance. 74",

It is thought that in the presence of silica, the tubercle bacilli proliferate more rapidly because the ingested silica particles damage phagolysosomal membranes and thereby interfere with the defensive activity of the macrophages. The synergistic action of silica dust has long been held responsible for the inordinately high incidence of respiratory tuberculosis in mining communities. Many former South African gold miners now have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as well as silicosis and tuberculosis has consequently reached almost epidemic proportions amongst these men. Phagocyte damage by ingested dust particles may also cause some cases of chronic necrotising aspergillosis complicating pneumoconiosis. 111",

[119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] Alveolar macrophages are enlarged by numerous phagolysosomes distended by lamellar bodies that represent ingested surfactant. The alveoli are filled by such cells and, having a foamy cytoplasm, they produce the appearances of endogenous lipid pneumonia, similar to that more usually encountered as part of an obstructive pneumonitis distal to a bronchial tumour. The macrophages gradually disintegrate and the free denatured surfactant slowly becomes compacted, during which time its staining with both eosin and the periodic acid-Schiff reagents intensifies until the appearances are finally those of alveolar lipoproteinosis. This process prevents the aggregation and concentration of the dust in the usual foci and thereby hinders the development of silicosis. Lipoproteinosis and silicosis may be seen in conjunction but, more often, different areas of the lung show one or the other. The lipoproteinosis has its own severe impact on lung function, but, unlike silicosis, is potentially reversible (by massive alveolar lavage).",

            "text": "An amorphous silica is the principal component of the fossilised remains of diatoms that constitute the sedimentary rock, diatomite ( Fig. 7.1.11 ). This is generally obtained by open-cast mining, following which the rock is crushed and calcined. The calcined product is used in filters, insulation material and as a filler. Being amorphous, the silica in diatomite is harmless, but calcining (>1000\u00b0C) results in its conversion to crystalline forms of silica. Diatomaceous earth pneumoconiosis is unusual and its risk appears to be related to the amount of cristobalite and tridymite (two forms of crystalline silica) produced in the calcining process. 130 The silicates are complex compounds in which silicon and oxygen form an anion combined with cations such as aluminium and magnesium: talc, for example, is a hydrated magnesium silicate with the formula Mg 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 . Silicates include fibrous forms (asbestos and the zeolites), plate-like forms (talc and mica) and clays (kaolinite and fuller's earth). In histological sections, the platy talc and mica particles are generally cut tangentially and therefore appear needleshaped (see Fig. 7 .1.4). They are strongly birefringent whereas the clays are only weakly so. Talc particles in the lung exceeding 5 \u00b5m in length should arouse suspicion of intravenous drug abuse. 131 Of the fibrous silicates, zeolite is used as a building material in certain communities, notably in central Turkey. Pneumoconiosis is not a problem but zeolites are of medical interest because, like asbestos, they present a mesothelioma risk. Asbestos is dealt with separately (see below).",

            "text": "Pneumoconiosis has been described with various non-fibrous silicates, notably in the rubber industry, which uses talc and, less commonly, mica as lubricants. Other occupations posing a risk include the extraction of kaolinite from china clay (kaolin), 27, 132, 133 and in the open-cast and underground mining of fuller's earth (montmorillonite, bentonite and attapulgite clays, which were originally used in 'fulling' (degreasing) wool). 134, 135 However, all these substances are commonly contaminated with silica, asbestos or both, and it has been questioned whether in pure state they are at all fibrogenic. The modifying effect of inert substances such as iron on that of silica is well known (see mixed-dust pneumoconiosis, below) and it has been suggested that talc, mica and fuller's earth act in a similar way in regard to their more fibrogenic contaminants, the pneumoconioses attributed to them in reality representing mixed-dust pneumoconiosis or asbestosis. Contrary evidence comes from reports of pulmonary fibrosis in persons heavily exposed to pure talc, mica or kaolin. 32 All these silicates are evident in the tissues as plate-like birefringent crystals which often provoke a foreign-body giant cell reaction (see Fig. 7 .1.3) and may result in fibrotic nodules. Large focal lesions resembling the progressive massive fibrosis of coalworkers may be produced, and also a diffuse 'asbestosis-like' form of pneumoconiosis, the latter attributed to poor macrophage mobilisation of the plate-like particles. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] It would appear therefore that silicates are indeed fibrogenic if enough is inhaled; they appear to vary in fibrogenicity but in all cases they are less fibrogenic than silica.",

It is also the principal constituent of coal, which is dealt with separately below, and large amounts of pure carbon may be inhaled by workers involved in the manufacture of carbon black, carbon electrodes and charcoal. [141] [142] [143] [144] Although carbon is regarded as being non-fibrogenic, the very heavy lung burdens encountered in industries such as these may lead to the complicated form of pneumonconiosis known as progressive massive fibrosis that is more commonly encountered in coal workers (see p. 340). Heavy pure carbon deposition may also be acquired domestically when wood is burnt in buildings devoid of a chimney, so-called 'hut lung', 145 a term that is also applied to the domestic acquisition of carbon mixed with silica or silicates, resulting in forms of mixeddust pneumoconiosis. 57, 64, 65 Anthracofibrosis is a term introduced by Chinese bronchoscopists for bronchial stenosis or obliteration associated with carbon pigmentation of the mucosa. 146 Although the original description incriminated tuberculosis, mixtures of various mineral dusts acquired at work or domestically are a more likely cause. [147] [148] [149] [150] Iron dust in the lungs was first described by Zenker in 1867, when he also introduced the terms siderosis and pneumonokoniosis. 3 Zenker was describing a woman who coloured paper with iron oxide powder ('rouge'), a substance which is still encountered by some workers engaged in polishing silver, glass, stone and cutlery. Siderosis is also found in welders, iron foundry fettlers, steel workers, boiler scalers and haematite miners and crushers. Iron dust particles are reddish-brown but in the lung may be masked by carbon 151 : when evident, or revealed by microincineration, they resemble haemosiderin and generally give a positive Perls' reaction, but particularly with haematite, heat (60-80 o C) and concentrated (12N) hydrochloric acid may be necessary. 152 Haematite miners in both the UK (Cumbria) and France (Lorraine) have an increased risk of bronchial carcinoma, but radon gas rather than haematite is the suspected carcinogen. Radon is a decay product of uranium. Minute amounts are present in all rocks but local concentrations occur and these are liable to build up in mines if ventilation is limited.",

More diffuse interstitial fibrosis has been reported in about 16% of Welsh and West Virginian coalminers, usually involving those carrying a particularly heavy dust burden; it runs a more benign course than non-occupational interstitial fibrosis (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). 161 Similar findings have been reported from France. 162 Simple coal pneumoconiosis consists of focal dust pigmentation of the lungs, which may be associated with a little fibrosis and varying degrees of emphysema. Its clinical effects are relatively minor. Some degree of black pigmentation (anthracosis) of the lungs is common in the general urban population, especially in industrial areas, but much denser pigmentation is seen in coalminers, whose lungs at necropsy are black or slate-grey. Black pigment is evident in the visceral pleura along the lines of the lymphatics and on the cut surface where it outlines the interlobular septa and is concentrated in Macklin's centriacinar dust sumps ( Fig. 7.1.12 ). The dust is generally more plentiful in the upper parts of the lungs and in the hilar lymph nodes, possibly due to poorer perfusion and consequently poorer lymphatic drainage there (see p. 21). 162 Two forms of coal dust foci are recognised, macules and nodules, the former being soft and impalpable and the latter hard due to substantial amounts of collagen. Both lesions are typically stellate but the more fibrotic the nodules, the more rounded they become, until it is difficult to distinguish them macroscopically from those of silicosis. In these circumstances reliance has to be placed on the whorled pattern of the collagen that is evident microscopically in silicosis. The stellate nodules are analogous to those seen in mixed-dust pneumoconiosis caused by mixtures of silica and inert dusts other than carbon (see above). With polarising filters, small numbers of birefringent crystals may be seen in both macules and nodules, usually representing mica or kaolinite derived from rock that bordered the coal.",

Others find it very difficult to identify any convincing difference between the emphysema of coalworkers and that encountered outside the industry but Heppleston based his claims on the study of serial sections. By this means he showed that, although both forms affect respiratory bronchioles, the focal emphysema of coalworkers affects more proximal orders of these airways and is not associated with the bronchiolitis seen with centriacinar emphysema. Furthermore, focal emphysema is a dilatation lesion whereas coniosis, also known as progressive massive fibrosis, can have very serious consequences. Particularly when the lesions are large, it is associated with productive cough, breathlessness, significant impairment of lung function and premature death. The major factor accounting for the development of progressive massive fibrosis appears to be the sheer bulk of coal dust in the lung, rather than coal rank or the silica content of the mine dust. 179 Progressive massive fibrosis has occasionally been recorded in dockers loading silica-free coal into the holds of ships 158 and in workers exposed to pure carbon in the manufacture of carbon black and carbon electrodes. [141] [142] [143] Progressive massive fibrosis is characterised by large (over 1 cm) black masses, situated anywhere in the lungs but most common in the upper lobes. The lesions may be solitary or multiple and very large, occupying most of the lobe and even crossing an interlobar fissure to involve an adjacent lobe (Figs 7.1.3B, 7.1.16). They cut fairly easily, often with the release from a central cavity of black fluid flecked by cholesterol crystals. For many years it was believed that the condition was the result of synergism between mycobacterial infection and dust but the failure of the attack rate to decrease as tuberculosis declined negated this view. 180 Today, more emphasis is placed on total dust load for the lesions tend to affect lungs that carry an unduly heavy dust burden. If the remainder of the lung shows little evidence of dust accumulation, the possibility of the masses representing Caplantype lesions (see below) should be considered. centriacinar emphysema involves destruction of adjacent alveolar walls. By definition, therefore, focal emphysema is not a true emphysema at all (see p. 102). However, it has been shown that mineral dusts cause elastin and collagen breakdown in the rat lung. 170 Focal emphysema may progress to the destructive centriacinar form and this has strengthened claims that mine dust plays a causal role in centriacinar emphysema. 1, [171] [172] [173] [174] [175] [176] In the UK, these claims have been accepted and chronic bronchitis and emphysema in coalminers and metal production workers have been accepted as prescribed industrial diseases since 1992. 177 In Germany too, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is now compensatable as an occupational disease. The conditions for compensation in the UK were initially:",

            "text": "Asbestos is a generic term for more than 30 naturally occurring fibrous silicates, fibre being defined as an elongated particle with a length-tobreadth (aspect) ratio of at least 3. Asbestos fibres have a high aspect ratio, generally over 8. Based on their physical configuration they can be divided into two major groups, serpentine and amphibole. The physical dimensions and configuration of asbestos fibres are strongly linked to their pathogenicity. Chrysotile (white asbestos) is the only important serpentine form. It accounts for most of the world production of asbestos of all types ( 194 Being a serpentine mineral, chrysotile consists of long, curly fibres that can be carded, spun and woven like cotton ( Fig.  7.1.19 ). The curly chrysotile fibres are carried into the lungs less readily than the straight amphibole asbestos fibres, and once there undergo physicochemical dissolution and are cleared more readily. They readily fragment into short particles that are easily ingested by macrophages and in the acidic environment of the macrophage phagolysosome they are particularly unstable. The half-life of chrysotile in the lungs is estimated to be in the order of only a few months. 195, 196 Not surprisingly therefore chrysotile is the least harmful type of asbestos in respect of all forms of asbestos-induced pleuropulmonary disease. [197] [198] [199] It may nevertheless cause pulmonary fibrosis if sufficient is inhaled. 200, 201 In contrast to chrysotile, amphibole forms of asbestos consist of straight rigid fibres that are stable within the lung. They do not fragment, they are insensitive to chemical attack and their clearance halflives are in the order of decades rather than months. 196 The main amphibole forms of asbestos of commercial importance are crocidolite (blue asbestos) and amosite (brown asbestos). Crocidolite, reputedly the most dangerous in regard to all forms of asbestos-related disease, was formerly mined in Western Australia (Wittenoom) and South Africa (Cape Province and the Transvaal); it was the principal amphibole used in the UK. Amosite, the name of which derives from the acronym for the former Asbestos Mines of South Africa company in the Transvaal, was the principal amphibole used in North America. Amphiboles are no longer imported by the developed countries but much remains in old lagging and presents a considerable dust hazard when this is removed. Tremolite, a further amphibole asbestos, contaminates Quebec chrysotile deposits, Montana vermiculite and many forms of commercial (non-cosmetic) talc and is responsible for much of the asbestos-related disease in chrysotile miners and millers. 202 Another amphibole asbestos, anthophyllite, was formerly mined in Finland. It causes pleural plaques (see p. 716) but not lung disease, possibly because its fibres are relatively thick ( Fig. 7.1.20) . 203 Erionite is a zeolite rather than a type of asbestos but is comparable in form to amphibole asbestos and is also biopersistent. It is found . These coated structures are termed 'asbestos bodies' . Because other fibres may gain a similar coat, the non-specific term 'ferruginous body' has been advocated. However, coated carbon fibres (so-called coal bodies) are easily recognised as such by their black core. 206 In practice, ferruginous bodies with the appearance of asbestos bodies almost always prove to have an asbestos core. 207, 208 Long fibres are more likely to be coated than short ones, which are cleared more quickly: in one study few fibres less than 5 \u00b5m in length were coated and few fibres over 40 \u00b5m in length were uncoated. 209 Amphiboles form bodies more readily than chrysotile. A comparison of light and electron microscopic fibre counts found that 0.14% of chrysotile, 5% of crocidolite and 26.5% of amosite formed bodies. 210 Nevertheless, sufficient chrysotile fibres are coated to permit recognition of asbestosis by standard histological criteria (diffuse fibrosis and asbestos bodies), even if chrysotile is the only asbestos present. 211 Despite the biodegradability of chrysotile, asbestos body numbers do not materially diminish with time. 212 Very occasionally however a patient with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and a history of asbestos exposure has no evident asbestos bodies but analysis shows a fibre burden within the range found in asbestosis, justifying fibre analysis in such cases. 212a There is evidence that alveolar macrophages are involved in the coating of asbestos fibres to form asbestos bodies and that the bodies are less harmful to the macrophages than uncoated fibres. 213 Asbestos bodies give a Prussian blue reaction for iron when stained by Perls' method and their yellow-brown colour makes them easily recognisable in unstained films of sputum or in unstained histological sections. Sections may be cut 30 \u00b5m thick to increase the yield and help identify bodies that lie at an angle to the microtome blade. There is a good correlation between the numbers of asbestos bodies seen in lung sections and those in tissue digests. 214, 215 The bodies may be found singly or in irregular clumps or stellate clusters. They are unevenly distributed but in well-established asbestosis they are easily found. If they are not evident, asbestos burden may be assessed quantitatively in tissue digests (see below). Their presence in lung tissue, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid merely confirms exposure, not the presence of disease. However, the number of asbestos bodies in lavage fluid correlates well with lung asbestos burden 216, 217 and the number in sputum correlates with the duration and intensity of exposure. [216] [217] [218] Fibre counts 193, 208, [219] [220] [221] [222] [223] Quantitation is desirable in certain circumstances (Box 7.1.1), in which case it is best effected on 2-cm 3 blocks of fixed or fresh lung tissue obtained from three different sites, avoiding tumour and thickened pleura. The tissue blocks are digested with caustic soda or bleach, following which the fibres may be collected on a millipore membrane or viewed in suspension in a red blood cell-counting chamber. If phase contrast optics are used both coated and uncoated fibres can be assessed. 219 Alternatively, dark ground illumination can be used to demonstrate uncoated fibres. 221 However, electron microscopy is to be preferred as it detects far more fibres than are visible by light microscopy and can also provide information on fibre type. It is important that the laboratory is well practised in fibre analysis and has established its own control range for the general population as well as asbestosis as most lungs contain some asbestos.",

Slicing the lung affected by asbestosis shows a fine subpleural fibrosis, especially of the lower lobes ( Fig. 7 .1.23). In severe cases the fibrosis often extends upwards to involve the middle lobe and lingula, and sometimes the upper lobes also. Microcystic change associated with the fibrosis develops in advanced cases and in severe disease there may be cysts over 1 cm in diameter. However, these classic changes are seldom seen in developed countries today. Following decades of dust suppression in asbestos factories, current patients have mild to moderate asbestosis and are dying of related cancer or of non-pulmonary disease. 238 In some of these cases the asbestosis is only detectable microscopically. Fixation of the lungs through the bronchi and the use of Heard's barium sulphate impregnation technique facilitate demonstration of the fibrosis (see p. 757 and Fig. 7.1.23 ). The mild degree of asbestosis currently encountered is of little functional significance but is often critical in determining whether an associated carcinoma of the lung should be attributed to asbestos exposure (see below).",

Hence, with light exposure there is a substantial risk of mesothelioma but only a small risk of lung cancer. Asbestosis requires heavy exposure and in one group of patients with asbestosis, 39% died of pulmonary carcinoma, 10% of mesothelioma and 19% of other respiratory diseases. 238 Although there were many earlier reports, the link with carcinoma of the lung may be considered to have been firmly established by 1955, 275 that between crocidolite asbestos and mesothelioma by 1960, 276 and that between amosite asbestos and mesothelioma by 1972. 277 Mesothelioma is considered on page 717.",

There is usually a latent period in excess of 20 years between first exposure to asbestos and the development of lung cancer and the risk increases the greater the cumulative exposure. The increased risk involves carcinomas of all the histological types encountered in the lung, although adenocarcinoma has been disproportionately overrepresented. 245, [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] It is uncertain 114 whether the increased risk of carcinoma is caused by the asbestos 192, [286] [287] [288] [289] [290] [291] or the asbestosis. [292] [293] [294] [295] [296] [297] [298] [299] The latter view envisages the carcinoma arising in the foci of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and dysplasia that commonly accompany any interstitial fibrosis (see carcinoma complicating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, p. 275). However, most carcinomas complicating asbestosis arise in the bronchi rather than the alveolar tissue. On the other hand, more arise in the sites worst affected by asbestosis, the lower lobes and the periphery of the lung, than in the general population ( Fig. 7.1.26) . 238, 245, [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] The majority view has been that asbestosis is a necessary precursor of the carcinoma but evidence to the contrary is finding increasing support (Table 7 .1.8). 192 In the UK, industrial compensation was formerly only awarded to an asbestos worker for carcinoma of the lung if there was also asbestosis or diffuse pleural fibrosis but new rules were introduced in 2006. Asbestosis remains a sufficient criterion but diffuse pleural thickening is not and asbestosis is no longer a necessary criterion: asbestos is deemed to have been responsible if the patient worked in asbestos textile manufacture, spraying, lagging or gas mask manufacture for at least 5 years before 1975 or 10 years after 1975. The basis for these changes is the premise that heavy asbestos exposure is sufficient in itself to account for carcinoma of the lung. 278 Together, these factors have a multiplicative rather than additive effect",

Much of the airflow limitation is attributable to cigarette smoking but it is also seen in non-smoking asbestos workers and is worse in those with asbestosis. 300 The pathological basis of this appears to be small-airways disease (see p. 123). 301 It is possibly a non-specific reaction to inhaled dust or cigarette smoke. 302 Because it is not established that this lesion progresses to interstitial alveolar fibrosis (asbestosis) the term 'asbestos airways disease' is suggested. 302 Fibrosis limited to the bronchioles is specifically excluded from the definition of asbestosis in the latest guidelines (although these retain grade 0 for fibrosis limited to the bronchiolar walls). 193 It should also be noted that, although emphysema is considered to be a destructive rather than fibrotic condition, a little focal ",

Indeed, at one time Canadian miners breathed aluminium dust before work, in the belief that this would reduce the danger of silica in the mine dust 304 and more recently silicosis has been treated by such means in France. 305 It is questionable whether this practice is effective but it at least appears to cause no harm. The explanation for these contradictory observations probably lies in differing methods of manufacture of aluminium powder. Aluminium metal appears to be an inert substance but this is only because it has a high affinity for oxygen and the surface layer of aluminium oxide so formed is firmly bound to the underlying metal, unlike ferric oxide which permits further rusting of iron. Granular aluminium powders, produced in a ball mill or from a jet of molten aluminium, therefore acquire a protective coat of surface oxide and are inert. With stamped aluminium powders, however, surface oxidation is prevented by lubricants added to aid the separation of these flake-like particles. The usual lubricant (stearin) contains stearic acid and this polar compound combines with the underlying metal, which is thereby protected from both atmospheric oxidation and the action of body fluids when such dust is inhaled. In certain circumstances, however, non-polar lubricants in the form of mineral oils have been substituted for stearin. This happened in Germany during the Second World War when munition production was stepped up but stearin was difficult to obtain, 306, 307 and in the UK in the 1950s to make the powder darker for purely commercial reasons. 308 In vitro, oil-coated stamped aluminium powder reacts with water to produce aluminium hydroxide, which affords the underlying metal no protection against further attack, so that aluminium hydroxide continues to be formed. 309 This substance is a protein denaturant, once used in the tanning industry, and it is believed that this property underlies the very ex ceptional cases of severe pulmonary fibrosis that have occurred in connection with stamped aluminium powder produced with mineral oil rather than stearin. 309, 310 The fibrosis has a very characteristic pattern, affecting the upper lobes and progressing rapidly, the interval from onset of symptoms to death being as short as 2 years. 308 There is marked shrinkage of the lungs with gross elevation of the diaphragm and buckling of the trachea (Fig. 7.1.27 ). The lungs are grey ( Fig. 7.1.28) and microscopically, numerous small black jagged particles are seen. These can be shown to contain aluminium with Irwin's aluminon stain or by microprobe analysis. 311 What appears to be a different pathological effect of aluminium dust on the lungs is the rare development of granulomatous disease resembling sarcoidosis and berylliosis. 312, 313 This represents hypersensitivity to the metal, amenable to confirmation with a lymphocyte transformation test similar to that used to diagnosis berylliosis (see below).",

It is used in the tips of drill bits, on abrasive wheels and discs, and in armaments. Interstitial lung disease is liable to arise in its manufacture or in those using hard metal as an abrasive. 316 Experimental work suggests that cobalt is the dangerous constituent 317 but this element is soluble and, unless industrial contact has been recent, analysis of lung tissue usually shows tungsten and titanium but no cobalt. The role of cobalt is also indicated by the development of similar interstitial lung disease in diamond polishers using high-speed polishing discs made with a diamond-cobalt surface that lacked tungsten carbide and the other constituents of hard metal. 318, 319 Hard-metal lung disease and cobalt lung take two forms, an industrial asthma and interstitial fibrosis. The latter has a diffuse lower zonal distribution and the appearances mimic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, an unusual feature is the presence of moderate, or perhaps only small numbers, of giant cells (Fig. 7.1.29A, B) . 316, 320 Not only are there multinucleate alveolar macrophages but syncytial cell forms develop in the alveolar epithelium. Electron microscopy confirms that these are multinucleate type II pneumocytes (Fig. 7.1.29C ). 316 Such epithelial changes are well known in measles pneumonia but the viral inclusion bodies that characterise this infection are not found in hard-metal pneumoconiosis. The changes are those initially described as a particular pattern of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia termed giant cell interstitial pneumonia or GIP (see p. 264). Elemental analysis shows that many, but not all, cases of GIP represent hardmetal disease. The exceptions seldom give a history of cobalt exposure and must be presumed to represent true idiopathic cases. Conversely, epithelial giant cells are not always found in hard-metal pneumoconiosis and so their presence, although highly characteristic, is neither totally specific nor totally sensitive.",

Sometimes, the escape of dangerous fumes from the factories was on such a scale that people living in nearby houses, downwind from the places in which these materials were being worked, contracted and occasionally died from berylliosis ('neighbourhood cases'). 323 Alternatively, contamination of a beryllium worker's clothes might lead to berylliosis in a temperatures. The alloys of beryllium are also now widely used, especially those with copper, on which it confers elasticity and resistance to fatigue. Alloy manufacture and the machining of beryllium alloys are therefore further activities that entail a risk of berylliosis, as is the recovery of the metal in the recycling of scrapped electronic and computer parts. Seemingly innocuous occupations such as dental laboratory technician are not without risk of chronic berylliosis. 329",

Further evidence for the disease having an allergic basis derives from bronchoalveolar lavage, which demonstrates an excess of T-helper lymphocytes that proliferate in vitro on exposure to beryllium salts. 330 A positive transformation test given by these lymphocytes is a more reliable indicator of disease than in vitro blood lymphocyte transformation testing, 52 which is safe but not wholly reliable and indicates only sensitization, rather than berylliosis.",

The workers were required to paint patterns on textiles using a hand-held spray gun. The atmospheric pollution was intense but complaints of respiratory difficulties were met with reassurances and the workers urged to continue. This they did because of the otherwise poor economy, often returning to work when disabling breathlessness had settled down. A change of paint (to Acramin F) may have contributed because the worst-affected workers were employed at two plants that had made this switch. Their illness has been described as the 'Ardystil syndrome' after the name of one of these factories. Some workers were left with permanent respiratory disability. One required a lung transplant and 6 others died. [351] [352] [353] [354] Transbronchial biopsy showed organising pneumonia, which in the fatal cases had progressed to irreversible interstitial fibrosis. A similar outbreak of respiratory disease was subsequently reported in Algerian textile factories where Acromin F was applied by the same technique. 355, 356 Acromin F is marketed as a paste and used as such without ill-effect. Its use in heavy spray form appears to be responsible for the 'Ardystil syndrome' .",

However, welders may suffer various ill-effects from the inhalation of substances other than iron (Table 7.1.9). Some of these are para-occupational risks, that is, encountered by welders because they work near another process and are inadvertently exposed: thus, shipyard welders may be exposed to asbestos, 365 and those in foundries to silica. Welders may therefore develop a mixed-dust pneumoconiosis (see p. 337), rather than just siderosis. However, one analytical investigation identified excess amounts of iron alone in association with pulmonary fibrosis; the silicon content did not differ from that in controls. 366 More directly, welders may be exposed to asbestos insulation that they themselves use, while welders of special steel alloys run the risk of metal-induced asthma, metal fume fever, polymer fume fever and the consequences of toxic metal fume inhalation, 367 all of which are described separately in this chapter, as is lung disease in aluminium welders. Chronic bronchitis has been attributed to the inhalation of low concentrations of irritants such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide by welders but this risk is unproven and the subject of much controversy. Welders may also inhale carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds in the course of their work and therefore develop lung cancer. The term 'welder's lung' is often applied indiscriminately to any of these diseases and, as it has no specific meaning, is best avoided.",

Potentially dangerous levels of ozone are produced from atmospheric oxygen by ultraviolet radiation given off in welding while ozone is used in industry to sterilise water, bleach paper, flour and oils, and mask the odour of organic effluents. The damage wrought by ozone is predominantly centriacinar in distribution, affecting terminal and respiratory bronchiolar epithelium and proximal alveolar epithelium. [380] [381] [382] There is loss of cilia and necrosis of centriacinar alveolar type I epithelial cells. The changes are dose-dependent and, in one study, the youngest animals were most sensitive. 383 In long-term experiments, hyperplastic bronchiolar Clara and ciliated cells extended peripherally to line alveolar ducts. 384 The role of granulocytes is stressed in some experimental studies 385 and it is notable that neutrophil migration is prominent when the human lungs are damaged by ozone. 386 Aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde and acrylic aldehyde (acrolein) are widely used in the plastics and chemical industries. The first is a liquid and the others are water-soluble gases. Pathologists are of course familiar with formaldehyde solution from its use as a disinfectant and histological fixative. All these aldehydes are intensely irritant and their acute effects generally prevent prolonged exposure to high concentrations. Chronic effects include skin sensitivity and asthma, and in rats nasal carcinoma. However, the doses to which these experimental animals were exposed far exceed any that are likely to be encountered by humans, in whom there is no convincing evidence of aldehyde-induced cancer. 387 Ammonia gas is extensively used in industry as a raw material, notably in the manufacture of nitrogenous products such as fertilisers and plastics. It is highly soluble and its acute irritative effects are mainly felt in the eyes, nose and throat, but high levels affect the major airways, possibly leading to them being blocked by exudates. Survival usually brings full recovery but bronchiectasis and obliterative bronchiolitis have been described.",

The commonest, in descending order, are isocyanates, flour and grain, laboratory animals, glutaraldehyde, solder or colophony and hardening agents. 400 Atopy appears to predispose to occupational asthma when the allergen is of high molecular weight but not when it is of low molecular weight. For example, atopic individuals are particularly prone to develop asthma if employed in the manufacture of biological detergents, whereas atopy does not increase the risk of asthma from sensitisation to toluene di-isocyanate, which is a serious health problem in the manufacture of polyurethane. Similarly, platinum salts are such potent sensitising agents that nearly all those exposed to them develop asthma. Asthma-provoking metals other than platinum include chromium, cobalt, nickel and vanadium, all of which are used in steel alloys, and possibly aluminium (see pot-room asthma, p. 357). Other asthma-inducing factors encountered in industry include grain and flour dust, certain wood dusts, soldering fluxes containing colophony (pine resin), epoxy resin hardeners such as phthallic anhydride, isocyanate-containing foams and paints, formaldehyde and the excreta of laboratory animals. Contaminated humidifiers may cause occupational asthma as well as humidifier fever and extrinsic allergic alveolitis. 401 Pathologically, occupational asthma is identical to nonoccupational asthma (see p. 109).",

Humidifier fever develops in circum-stances that also lead to the development of a form of extrinsic allergic alveolitis, and not surprisingly the same name has been extended to this latter condition, with inevitable confusion. Both diseases are caused by microbiological contamination of humidifiers or air conditioners so that a fine spray of microorganisms is emitted into the office, factory or home. Investigations have generally shown the baffle plates of the air conditioner to be covered with a slime of bacteria, fungi or protozoa (mainly amoeba and ciliates), and extracts of this have been used to identify precipitins in the patient's sera, as in extrinsic allergic alveolitis. However, unlike extrinsic allergic alveolitis, humidifier fever resolves within a day and leaves no permanent injury. For this reason there is seldom the opportunity to study the tissue changes, and partly for this reason it remains unclear whether the disease is mediated by immune complexes, as in extrinsic allergic alveolitis, or by endotoxins derived from the contaminants.",

These mechanisms often act together but sometimes there is only blast injury, to which the lungs are particularly vulnerable. For a time it was considered that the damage was direct, the blast wave travelling down the airways to injure the lungs. However, at the start of the Second World War, experiments conducted in the UK showed that the lungs were injured indirectly, the blast wave being transmitted to them through the chest wall: pulmonary blast injury is worst on the side of the body towards the explosion, and can be reduced by protective clothing. 3 Underwater explosions are particularly dangerous because water is incompressible. There may be severe internal injury but no external evidence of damage other than a trickle of blood from the mouth or nose. This is because the injury is rate-dependent. Quite small thoracic deform-ation may produce severe pulmonary damage if peak compression is attained very quickly, typically in less than 5 ms. Conversely, severe chest wall distortion may produce only minor pulmonary contusion if this time is extended beyond 20 ms. 4 At necropsy, the lungs are contused, with blood evident in the airways and parenchyma. Depending on the force of the blast, the haemorrhage may be pinpoint, patchy or confluent. It tends to follow the lines of the ribs and may be accompanied by pleuropulmonary lacerations having the same distribution. In this case there will also be haemothorax, pneumothorax and possibly air embolism. Patchy pulmonary haemorrhages cuff the blood vessels. 5, 6 In patients who survive for a few days, the lungs resemble the liver macroscopically and histologically show chronic interstitial inflammation and fibrosis as well as haemorrhage. 7 Other injuries are often present and fat embolism, aspiration pneumonia, fluid overload and infection may all be added to the effects of the blast wave.",

Injury to the lung is caused by trapped alveolar gas expanding so rapidly that it exceeds total lung capacity before it can escape through the trachea. The lungs literally burst: the alveolar walls rupture and blood mixes directly with alveolar air. The victim experiences chest pain and there may be blood-stained froth at the mouth or frank haemoptysis. Air may enter the alveolar walls to cause interstitial emphysema or air embolism. Asthmatics may be at particular risk because of regional air-trapping. 10 . Diving mammals such as porpoises and whales are protected from such dangers of peripheral air-trapping by cartilage extending far out into the finest conductive airways so that these passages never close, even at the end of full expiration (Fig. 7.2.1) . 11, 12 Patients requiring positive-pressure artificial respiration are also at risk of burst lung, but the complications of the resultant interstitial emphysema differ from those experienced by divers. In divers, the chest wall is buttressed by the surrounding water and air in the interstitium is liable to track towards the hilum of the lungs and enter pulmonary veins, with resultant cerebral and coronary air embolism, either of which may prove fatal. 13 Iatrogenic burst lung, on the other hand, takes place in patients whose chest wall is not so buttressed, and then outward rupture of the interstitial air is more likely, resulting in pneumothorax. Extension of the interstitial emphysema to the mediastinum, neck and chest wall is also more likely in such patients, resulting in surgical emphysema at these sites. However, there are exceptional cases marked by both cerebral embolism and extensive air tracking. 14 ",

Gradual decompression permits the nitrogen to diffuse across the alveolar membranes and be exhaled. If, however, substantial amounts of nitrogen are released from solution, sufficient pulmonary arteries may be blocked to cause pulmonary hypertension, with resultant opening of arteriovenous communications or a patent foraman ovale, so permitting the gas to enter the systemic circulation. This is often followed by limb pains ('the bends') and perhaps cerebral symptoms ('the staggers'). Fatal cases are characterised by gas bubbles within blood vessels throughout the body and froth in the heart chambers. Delayed effects include ischaemic necrosis of bones and other tissues. 17 Deep-diving mammals are protected by the same mechanism that prevents them suffering from burst lung. They exhale before diving and during the dive the chest is compressed to the extent that virtually all the gas in the lungs passes into the cartilage-buttressed nonrespiratory airways (see Fig. 7.2.1) , resulting in very little to be absorbed by the blood. The pulmonary collapse also serves to reduce buoyancy. The distribution of the little gas that is absorbed is minimised by bradycardia. 18 Many viscera experience anaerobic respiration but hypoxia is minimised in the heart and musculature by high levels of haemoglobin and myoglobin. The brain is further protected by the supplying arteries drawing on oxygen stored in an unusual spongelike cervical organ known as the rete mirabilis. ",

An association with certain HLA complexes (HLA-DR6 and HLA-DQ4) suggests that this has a genetic basis. 25 Although arteriolar constriction only tends to protect the pulmonary capillaries, it could explain the oedema if the process was patchy -as is the resultant oedema -for patchy arteriolar constriction would subject the rest of the lung to abnormally high pressures and lead to capillary stress failure in these areas (see pp. 402 and 448). 26, 27 Measurements of capillary pressure suggest that this is indeed the case. 28 Furthermore, vasodilators such as calcium channel blocking agents and inhaled nitric oxide gas 23, 29, 30 have been used with success to counter acute mountain sickness, supporting the idea that hypoxic vasoconstriction plays a central role.",

Areas of haemorrhagic oedema alternate with others that contain clear oedema fluid and others that are normal apart from overinflation. Pulmonary arterial thrombi are commonly found. Microscopy confirms the presence of haemorrhagic oedema and may show neutrophils and hyaline membranes in the alveoli. The alveolar capillaries are congested and may contain thrombi. There may also be an increase in mast cells and rarely pulmonary infarction. The right ventricle is commonly dilated whereas the left ventricle is normal. Highlanders generally show right ventricular hypertrophy and increased muscle in their pulmonary arteriesm, changes that are not apparent in lowlanders. 31, 32 Chronic mountain sickness Prolonged residence at high altitude leads to hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (see p. 424), an increase in red cell mass and cor pulmonale. Livestock taken from lowland plains to high-altitude pastures suffer similarly but the natural stock of the Himalayas and Ethiopian highlands are apparently immune. So too are other species long established at high altitude such as the llama and yak. These species are said to have adapted to their climate, that is, the forces of natural selection have bred out the pulmonary vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia. Cattle of European origin and humans acclimatise to high altitude by processes such as increasing their red cell mass but generally they are not adapted like native species and suffer hypoxic pulmonary hypertension at altitudes in excess of 3000 m. Certain Himalayan highlanders may be an exception to this in that their small pulmonary arteries are reported not to show the muscularisation that characterises hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. 33 In cattle of European origin, the dependent oedema of right-sided cardiac failure caused by hypoxic pulmonary hypertension affects the breast (brisket) particularly and in the Rocky Mountains of North America such cattle are said to have 'brisket disease' . 34 A human counterpart of this has been described in children of Chinese ancestry who have been taken to reside in Tibet and who have developed a fatal form of subacute infantile mountain sickness. 35 A small minority of permanent residents in the Andes develop the changes of chronic mountain sickness to a marked degree and are said to suffer from Monge's disease. 36 The basis of this is alveolar hypoventilation, which leads to a progressive fall in systemic arterial oxygen saturation and elevation of haemoglobin concentration to an unusually severe degree. The latter averages about 25 g/dl, which exceeds even the 20 g/dl found in healthy high-altitude residents. Patients with Monge's disease are so deeply cyanosed that their lips are virtually black. Their pulmonary artery resistance is also markedly raised. The cause of the alveolar hypoventilation is uncertain but the only cases of Monge's disease that have come to necropsy had conditions such as kyphoscoliosis that predispose to alveolar hypoxia.",

[37] [38] [39] Fresh water is absorbed even more quickly. It is unnecessary to tip the patient to hasten this process. Any water recovered in this way comes from the stomach and time that should be devoted to mouth-to-mouth breathing and cardiac massage is lost. These resuscitative efforts may need to be prolonged as fresh water in particular inactivates alveolar surfactant, leading to alveolar collapse which persists until the surfactant is replenished. Very few victims who are resuscitated on site fail to survive, and very few who cannot be resuscitated on site recover later.",

            "text": "The lungs have a rather stereotyped pattern of response to inhaled toxins, displaying degenerative changes and inflammation of varying degree, the former sometimes amounting to necrosis. In general, the site of maximal absorption or injury is related to solubility (for gases and vapours) and particle size (for aerosols such as dusts, fog, fumes, mists, smog and smoke): the less water-soluble and the smaller the particle size, the further down the respiratory tract the agent will penetrate ( Fig. 7 [40] [41] [42] Thus, ammonia produces intense congestion of the upper respiratory passages and laryngeal oedema whereas phosgene has little effect on these sites but causes pulmonary oedema. 40 Air pollution [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] The toxic (as opposed to allergenic) air pollutants thought to pose the greatest threat to the lungs comprise smoke particles, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, various aldehydes and ozone. Smoke and sulphur dioxide derive particularly from the combustion of fossil fuels in domestic fires and power stations, nitrogen dioxide is an important car exhaust and domestic gas appliance pollutant and ozone is the principal photochemical product of smog. Aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acrylic aldehyde (acrolein) also contribute to general air pollution because they are released in the combustion of diesel oil and petrol. Collectively, these pollutants have been incriminated in the exacerbation (rather than causation) of asthma. They also predispose to respiratory infection and result in airway inflammation and hypersecretion. 48, 49 Their effect on children is of particular concern because development of the lungs is known to continue well into childhood and damage to the lungs before their growth is complete is likely to be irreparable. At the other extreme of life episodes of severe air pollution are known to hasten the deaths of many patients with chronic airway disease. Particularly high concentrations of the agents responsible for air pollution may be encountered in industry and their effects are therefore also considered in Chapter 7.1, on occupational diseases of the lung. Many of the polycyclic hydrocarbons found in polluted air are carcinogenic (see p. 532) and it is therefore not surprising that urban air pollution has been found to be associated with excess mortality from lung cancer. 50 Domestic air pollution is rife in many of the poorer parts of the world due to the burning of biomass (wood, dried cow dung, bagasse, straw) in unventilated living rooms for heating and cooking. The women are particularly at risk of developing chronic bronchitis while their children have an increased incidence of acute respiratory infections. 51,52,52a Volcanic ash (tephra) irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory tract and in some eruptions may contain much free silica (e.g. Montserrat in 1995 and Mount St Helens, Washington state, USA in 1980) or be associated with the release of radon gas (e.g. the Azores in 1957). 53 The destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001 caused massive air pollution of New York city that had lasting respiratory effects on survivors, rescue workers and local residents. [54] [55] [56] At the time of the disaster there was much smoke from combustion of aeroplane fuel and flammable materials in the building while the collapse of the twin towers released dust from cement and dry-wall partitions that was highly alkaline. [57] [58] [59] This caused considerable irritation of the eyes and the conductive airways. A year later many victims were still suffering from bronchial hyperreactivity and poor ventilatory function, in a so-called reactive airways dysfunction syndrome 54, 55 and there was continuing spirometric decline 5 years later. 60 The respirable portion of the dust formed only a small fraction of the whole but given the level of exposure its future effects cannot be discounted, particularly as it contained substances such as asbestos. Unusual effects attributed to the disaster include acute eosinophilic pneumonia and granulomatous pneumonitis. 61, 62 Allergenic air pollutants are dealt with in detail in the sections on asthma (see p. 109) and extrinsic allergic alveolitis (see p. 279). Allergenic air pollution is generally occupational or domestic but periodic widespread air pollution was responsible for the epidemics of asthma seen in Barcelona in the 1980s, which were eventually traced to ships discharging cargoes of soya flour (see p. 114).",

Of the greatest importance, both in the number of patients they affect and in their clinical effects on the individual, are the various forms of chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer, but there are many other respiratory diseases associated with smoking, and a few that are less common in smokers (Box 7.2.1). 63 Not surprisingly, these diseases are often encountered in combination and sometimes one may obscure another. For example, a cigarette smoker may have emphysema in the upper lobes and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the lower lobes. 64, 65 Alternatively, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and desquamative interstitial pneumonia may affect the same parts of the lungs, in which case the focal lesions of the former may be masked by the latter condition. 63 The term 'smoking-related interstitial lung disease' has been introduced to cover a spectrum of interstitial diseases related to smoking 63, 66, 67 as well as being used in a more restricted sense to describe a combination of air space enlargement and interstitial fibrosis predominantly affecting the lower lobes. 68,69,69a Quite advanced interstitial fibrosis has been reported in smokers with no clinical evidence of interstitial lung disease. 69b Early changes detectable in smokers include chronic bronchiolitis, fibrosis of the bronchiolar wall and mild peribronchiolar interstitial fibrosis. 70, 71 Even earlier changes are detectable at the molecular level: as many as 152 smoking-responsive genes that are significantly up-regulated or down-regulated have been identified in normal cigarette smokers. 72 There is marked individual variation, which may explain why many lifelong heavy smokers experience no respiratory problems.",

Soot is cleared rapidly and if the patient survives a few days an absence of soot from the airways is to be expected. 76 Lung injury may result directly from heat and smoke inhalation or indirectly from the release of mediators associated with blast injury or shock. Although air temperature in a fire may reach very high temperatures thermal injury seldom extends beyond the carina but more extensive injury from heat alone was seen in men exposed to steam escaping from a fractured boiler pipe. 78 Those dying immediately showed coagulative necrosis of the respiratory mucosa down to the level of the alveolar ducts and alveolar congestion and oedema, while those surviving a little longer exhibited diffuse alveolar damage.

Irritant smoke products have two principal effects. Firstly, they cause an immediate painful stimulation of the eyes and respiratory tract which at low concentrations may prevent escape and at high concentrations may cause laryngeal spasm and death. Secondly, they cause bronchopulmonary injury some hours after exposure. Burned patients dying within 4-12 days often show tracheobronchial necrosis and diffuse alveolar damage with prominent hyaline membranes. 76, 77, 80 Secondary herpesvirus infection is often present. 81, 82 The respiratory changes caused by heat and smoke are non-specific and careful consideration of the many causes of lung injury in burned patients listed in Box 7.2.2 and of the clinical circumstances and management is generally required.

It is applied as a spray and if the manufacturer's instructions are followed there is no danger to health. Most fatal cases of paraquat poisoning, both accidental and suicidal, have been due to ingestion of the 20% aqueous solution Gramoxone. The less concentrated granular form Weedol is unlikely to be ingested accidentally but may be taken suicidally. 89 Paraquat is not absorbed by the intact skin but repeated or prolonged application damages the epidermis so that absorption into the blood stream with consequent systemic effects is possible, but rare. 90 Although paraquat has toxic effects on the liver, kidneys and myocardium, these are transient and attention has centred on the pulmonary changes, which are usually fatal. Following suicidal ingestion of large amounts of paraquat, death from multiorgan failure and pulmonary haemorrhage occurs within a few days, whereas most victims of accidental paraquat poisoning die from progressive pulmonary fibrosis between 10 and 14 days after ingestion. In those who survive longer, a honeycomb pattern of pulmonary fibrosis may be apparent. 91 Paraquat is a powerful oxidant and owes its toxicity to the production of active oxygen radicals. The lungs are particularly susceptible because paraquat is concentrated there by an active uptake mechanism in the alveolar epithelium. The inadvertent uptake of paraquat probably stems from a similarity between the molecular arrangement of its quaternary nitrogen atoms and the amine groups of endogenous oligoamines such as putrescine, spermidine and spermine, which are concerned in alveolar epithelial cell division and differentiation (Fig. 7.2.4) . 92 This results in paraquat levels being 6-10 times higher in the lung than in the plasma. Once taken up by the lung, paraquat is not metabolised but participates in redox cycling so that superoxide radicals are constantly produced. Epithelial injury is proportional to the concentration of paraquat, while it is lessened by hypoxia and antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, and potentiated by increased concentrations of oxygen. [93] [94] [95] [96] The high concentration of oxygen in the alveoli is a further reason why the lungs are particularly vulnerable to paraquat.",

The disease was initially thought to be Mycoplasma pneumonia but was soon found to be associated with the use of adulterated oil sold illicitly by door-to-door salesmen. Although it was sold for culinary purposes the oil had been produced for industrial use in steel manufacture. It consisted of rapeseed and olive oil mixed with liquified animal fat, aniline and other organic chemicals. It has not been possible to identify the exact chemical responsible for the disease or to reproduce the changes in other species but the later induction of similar pathological changes by another substance contaminated with an aniline derivative is possibly relevant (see l-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, p. 389). 111 Some clinical and pathological features of the disease suggest that immune mechanisms may also be involved. The initial clinical features included fever, respiratory distress, cough, haemoptysis, skin eruptions and marked eosinophilia. Radiographs suggested pulmonary oedema and sometimes showed pleural effusion. About 5% of patients died at this stage but most recovered quickly. However, within a few weeks many were readmitted to hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. About a quarter then proceeded to develop weakness, myalgia, weight loss, scleroderma-like skin signs and pulmonary hypertension. 112, 113 Many of these patients died after a long, wasting illness or are permanently disabled with neurological and hepatic disorders.",

In some patients dying of haemoptysis, dilated thin-walled blood vessels were identified in the mucosa of major blood-filled airways. Late features in the lungs included plexogenic arteriopathy (see p. 420), possibly secondary to changes in the liver. Similar inflammatory and vascular changes were seen in many other tissues.

It is apparently harmless when cooked but recently there has been a vogue in Taiwan for consuming large amounts of its unprocessed juice, blended with that of guavas or pineapple, because of its supposed efficacy as a slimming aid and in blood pressure control. Coincident with this fad there has been an upsurge in patients with symptoms of obstructive lung disease. Within a 4-month period more than 60 such patients were seen at one hospital. [115] [116] [117] They had four features in common: recent consumption of uncooked S. androgynus juice, fixed ventilatory obstruction, radiological evidence of bilateral bronchiectasis and an absence of any previous chronic respiratory disease. Four patients agreed to undergo open-lung biopsy. This showed chronic bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis of constrictive pattern. The lymphocytes were mainly T cells but immunofluorescent and electron microscopy showed no evidence of an immune process. Four patients underwent single-lung transplantation. The excised lungs showed sclerotic obliteration of bronchial arteries in the walls of bronchi 4-5 mm in diameter with segmental necrosis of bronchi 2-4 mm in diameter. The changes were considered to fit best with segmental ischaemic necrosis of bronchi at the watershed zone of the bronchial and pulmonary vasculature. 118 Further patients have required lung transplantation but public education of the dangers of this herbal medicine now appears to have been successful. 119 ",

Those of tobacco smoking are summarised above and dealt with in detail in the chapters on obstructive lung disease (Chapter 3) and carcinoma of the lung (Chapter 12.1). Less well known is the lung disease that results from smoking Blackfat tobacco, a practice popular with Guyanese Indians. Blackfat is the trade name of a type of tobacco that is flavoured with mineral oil, some of which vaporises and is inhaled when the tobacco is smoked, to cause exogenous lipid pneumonia (see p. 314 [Ch8] ). 120 In recent years the smoking of two other substances, marijuana and cocaine, has gained in popularity. It would not be surprising if the long-term effects of smoking these substances were similar to those of cigarette smoking but as yet it is too early to judge. However, the short-term effects are similar to those of tobacco smoking and this bodes badly for their ultimate effects.",

            "text": "Marijuana consists of the dried leaves of the cannabis plant, also known as hemp, as opposed to hashish, which is the plant's resin, and a further extract known as 'weed oil' . All these substances are smoked because they contain cannabis alkaloids which have psychoactive effects. However, this habit also exposes the lungs to many of the same respiratory irritants that are found in tobacco smoke. Initial exposure to marijuana smoke often results in coughing while habitual smokers produce black sputum. Bronchial biopsy shows inflammation and squamous metaplasia and bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrates increased numbers of cells, which are predominantly macrophages but also include neutrophils. [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] These changes are virtually identical to the short-term effects of tobacco smoke and are therefore likely to be similarly followed by the development of chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer. Indeed, the dangers of smoking marijuana are probably greater than those of smoking tobacco as compared with tobacco smoking it is associated with a fivefold greater increase in blood carboxyhaemoglobin and a threefold increase in the amount of tar inhaled. 126 It is estimated that three cannabis cigarettes result in the same degree of bronchial damage as 20 tobacco cigarettes. 127 There is also evidence that the effects of smoking marijuana and tobacco are additive. 128 Not surprisingly therefore, epidemiological studies report a doserelated impairment of large-airway function in marijuana smokers. 129 There are also several reports attributing pneumothorax to marijuana smoking ( Fig. 7.2.7) . 130, 131 The pneumothorax may be spontaneous or develop during the deep, sustained inspiratory effort involved in smoking marijuana (or cocaine), which may be enhanced by a partner applying positive ventilatory pressure by mouth-to-mouth contact. Thoracoscopy in such cases has shown predominantly apical, irregular bullous emphysema, while lung biopsy has demonstrated widespread alveolar filling by heavily pigmented macrophages. 131, 132 Evidence is also beginning to accumulate that long-term cannabis use increases the risk of lung cancer. 133 Smoking cannabis in the form of weed oil is also reported to result in exogenous lipid pneumonia. 134 Cocaine Cocaine hydrochloride is a fine white powder derived from the leaves of the plant Erythroxolon coca by a complex chemical process. It is heat-labile and therefore cannot be smoked. Users inject it intravenously or inhale it unheated through the nose, the latter practice being known as 'snorting' . However, a heat-stable free-base form that can be smoked is easily prepared from the hydrochloride with baking powder and a solvent such as ether. This process results in a crystalline deposit that is known as 'rock' because of its appearance or 'crack' because of the crackling sound it emits when heated. When smoked, the cocaine is readily absorbed and an intense surge of euphoria is experienced within 8 seconds. The intravenous route takes twice as long and 'snorting' several minutes. The hard addict therefore prefers to smoke 'crack' .",

Asthma may be aggravated, black sputum is produced, and pneumothorax and interstitial emphysema have resulted from Valsalva manoeuvres undertaken in the belief that they promote even more rapid absorption. Biopsy has shown pulmonary congestion and oedema, organising pneumonia, haemorrhage, haemosiderosis, diffuse alveolar damage and interstitial pneumonia or fibrosis. Less common effects include eosinophilic pneumonia, extrapulmonary eosinophilic angiitis, medial thickening of pulmonary arteries and the barotrauma described above (see Fig. 7.2.7) . Severe burning of the airways has also been seen due to 'crack' being smoked before all the ether used in its preparation has evaporated. 'Snorting' unheated cocaine has its own complications: substances such as cellulose or talc with which the drug is 'cut' (mixed as a diluent) are liable to provoke a foreign-body giant cell reaction in the lungs (Fig. 7.2.8 ). 145 However, particles of foreign material larger than those in the usual respirable range (allowing for the fibrous shape of substances such as cellulose) should suggest intravenous use (see 'Filler embolism', below).",

[21] [22] [23] [24] It remains the mainstay of treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia. Like other alkylating agents, it acts by cross-linking DNA strands. Clinical estimates of the incidence of pulmonary toxicity vary around 4% but subclinical damage is thought to be much more common. Although not strictly dose-dependent, toxicity is rarely seen with a total cumulative dose of less than 500 mg. Synergy with radiation and other cytotoxic drugs occurs. 25 Similar effects have been reported for most cytotoxic agents, particularly bleomycin. 26 Pulmonary toxicity is seen less commonly with other alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and melphalan. [27] [28] [29] [30] Bleomycin is a cytotoxic antibiotic derived from Streptomyces species. It is widely used in the treatment of neoplasms such as lymphomas and germ cell tumours, and is thought to produce its therapeutic and toxic effects by altering the normal balance between oxidants (active oxygen radicals) and antioxidant systems. 26 Bleomycin produces superoxide radicals when incubated with oxygen and iron in vitro. Oxygen enhances its effects, 31 a fact well known to anaesthetists who accordingly take care to limit concentrations of inspired oxygen to 30% in patients on bleomycin who are undergoing surgery. [32] [33] [34] Radiotherapy and cytotoxic agents such as bleomycin are also synergistic. Bleomycin is preferentially concentrated in the lungs and pulmonary fibrosis can be produced in animals when it is administered intravenously, intraperitoneally or by intratracheal instillation. Electron microscopy shows that the early changes consist of swelling and vesiculation of endothelial cells, interstitial oedema and type I epithelial cell necrosis. 35, 36 The reported incidence of bleomycin toxicity varies from 2 to 40% depending on the type of patient being treated and on dosage. In general, toxic effects increase with age and cumulative dose: above a total dose of about 500 units they rise significantly.",

The interstitial component is often accompanied by a non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrate. The proportions of inflammation, which is potentially reversible, and fibrosis, which when collagenous is irreversible, obviously bear on the prognosis. However, most case reports antedate the recent classification of interstitial pneumonia described in Chapter 6 and it is uncertain how their pathological appearances would now be classified. The majority lack the classic features of usual interstitial pneumonia and fibrotic non-specific interstitial pneumonia. Many show overlapping patterns of intersitital pneumonia and this alone should arouse suspicion that a drug may have been responsible. However, Some cytotoxic drugs result in pulmonary changes by more than one mechanism: for example, methotrexate may produce hypersensitivity reactions with granuloma formation [41] [42] [43] [44] or pulmonary eosinophilia 45 as well as diffuse alveolar damage. Pulmonary toxicity is also occasionally seen in patients undergoing treatment with gold salts for rheumatoid disease: in addition to diffuse alveolar damage, there may be eosinophilia and dermatitis in these cases, again indicating possible hypersensitivity. 46 Nitrofurantoin is another example of a drug resulting in a variety of patterns of alveolar injury: diffuse alveolar damage, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, giant cell interstitial pneumonia, organising pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia have all been recorded in association with this drug. [47] [48] [49] It should also be noted that in patients with neoplastic disease, clinical features suggestive of a pulmonary drug reaction may be due to factors other than drugs. In leukaemic patients, for example, these include direct infiltration of the lungs by leukaemic cells, opportunist infection and, if bone marrow transplantation has been undertaken, the effects of irradiation and possibly graft-versus-host disease.",

This leads to their accumulation throughout the body but the effect is most marked in tissues that take up the drug and contain cells rich in lysosomes. The lung fulfils both these requirements through its rich complement of alveolar macrophages. These cells accumulate the enzyme substrate (phospholipid) in their cytoplasm with the result that large foam cells fill the alveoli (Fig. 7.3.6 ). The appearances are those of endogenous lipid pneumonia, similar to that seen in obstructive pneumonitis. However, with amiodarone cytoplasmic vacuolation is also seen in epithelial and interstitial cells. The phospholipid inclusions contained within the vacuoles are particularly well seen in unstained frozen sections viewed by polarised light. 51 Identical changes to those induced by amiodarone were seen in the lungs of rats exposed to very high levels of the antidepressant drug iprindole 52 and the anorectic drug chlorphentermine. 53 These three compounds, iprindole, chlorphentermine and amiodarone, all belong to the amphiphilic group of drugs which block lysosomal phospholipase and sphingomyelinase. Although their pharmacological actions are very different, a molecular homology is apparent (Fig. 7.3.7) .",

Only a minority experience respiratory impairment and in these there is also evidence of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, which is possibly mediated immunologically. 54 These patients generally have a restrictive lung deficit, the onset of which may be acute or chronic. Bronchoalveolar lavage shows foamy macrophages but these cells indicate exposure to the drug rather than drug toxicity; nor are they specific to amiodarone, being observed on occasion with other drugs. Lymphocytes of suppressor type may also be detected on lavage. 54 Histologically, amiodarone toxicity is diagnosed on a combination of phospholipidosis and interstitial pneumonia and fibrosis. Occasionally the hyaline membranes of diffuse alveolar damage are superimposed on the interstitial changes (see Fig. 7.3.2) . [55] [56] [57] In some patients the fibrosis is intraalveolar rather than interstitial and the appearances are those of organising pneumonia. 58 The process may be localised and mimic a neoplasm radiologically. 59, 60 Amiodarone toxicity is probably dose-dependent but there is considerable individual variation in the amount required, 61 ,62 which appears to be under genetic control. 63 Amiodarone toxicity is uncommon in patients taking daily doses of 200 mg or less whereas the there are drugs that undoubtedly cause a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, for example the chemotherapeutic agents and nitrofurantoin (Fig. 7. 3.5), while others, for example the statins, are recorded as having induced a non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern. 39 A drug history is therefore imperative when assessing any patient with diffuse parenchymal lung disease.",

[72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Cases were subsequently described in Europe where there were further fatalities. l-tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is freely available to the public: its purchase does not require a medical prescription. It has been promoted as a dietary supplement and as an agent against insomnia and premenstrual tension. Women in the reproductive years preponderated in the patients affected by the resultant eosinophiliamyalgia. The clinicopathological features of the syndrome are similar to those of the Spanish toxic oil syndrome (see p. 375) and differ more in degree than type. The discovery of an aniline-derived contaminant in the tryptophan-induced condition is a further link connecting these two syndromes. 77 An immune basis is suggested by the identification of T lymphocytes activated against fibroblasts in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. 78 The illness is a multisystem disorder and besides blood eosinophilia and myalgia there may be arthralgia, fever, rash and involvement of the lungs, liver and central nervous system. As in the toxic oil syndrome, there is fasciitis, wasting and muscle pain associated with blood and tissue eosinophilia. The lungs are affected in 60% of cases. Pulmonary symptoms have included cough, dyspnoea and chest pain. Radiographs have shown diffuse bilateral infiltrates and pulmonary hypertension has been documented in a few cases. 79 Histology of the lungs shows an oedematous myxoid intimal thickening affecting small pulmonary blood vessels and a diffuse interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrate. 72, 73, 75, 76, 80 These cells may also be seen within the walls of the thickened blood vessels (Fig.  7.3.8) . 72, 76 Massive ingestion of l-tryptophan has resulted in the appearances of an organising pneumonia. 81 ",

[91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] The consumption of liquid paraffin as an aperient is common in some countries and may be taking place without the knowledge of the patient's medical practitioner. Regurgitation and aspiration of ingested oil are especially likely to happen during sleep in the presence of a hiatus hernia or when the oesophagus fails to empty completely into the stomach because of achalasia of the cardia. The aspiration of vegetable oil occurred in the past from the use of menthol in olive oil for the treatment of tuberculous laryngitis, and occasionally from the use of iodinated vegetable oils for bronchography. [98] [99] [100] [101] More recently exogenous lipid pneumonia has developed from the constant sucking of lollipops formulated for the administration of the analgesic fentanyl but also containing a stearate component. 102 The treatment of epistaxis by nasal packing with paraffin gauze has also led to exogenous lipid pneumonia. The pathology of exogenous lipid pneumonia is described on page 314. Other medicines may also be aspirated unwittingly, for example a ferrous sulphate tablet may cause brown iron staining and necrosis of the bronchus at the point of impact, progressing to bronchial stenosis. [103] [104] [105] Distal infection is then likely, as with any foreign body. Barium sulphate aspiration may complicate gastrointestinal radiography. 106 Large amounts may impair ventilation but being inert there is no permanent injury to the lungs, although the striking changes are evident on the chest radiograph.",

            "text": "An outbreak of pulmonary hypertension affecting many Swiss, Austrian and German patients in the period 1966-68 was probably due to the anorectic drug aminorex, 107 which was accordingly withdrawn with regression in the number of new cases. The pathology in these patients was identical to that of primary pulmonary hypertension (see p. 420) and it proved impossible to reproduce the condition in laboratory animals but the epidemiological evidence that aminorex was to blame is very strong. Fenfluramine and phentermine, further anorectic drugs that are chemically similar to aminorex, have also been associated with such plexogenic pulmonary hypertension, [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] and with fibroproliferative plaque on the tricuspid valve and pulmonary arteries. 113 Pulmonary hypertension due to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease has sometimes complicated the use of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents 114 or followed bone marrow transplantation. 115 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as indomethacin and diclofenac cross the placenta and, if given in late pregnancy, may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, resulting in severe neonatal pulmonary hypertension. 116, 117 Pulmonary hypertension is a well-recognised association of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but until recently has been unexplained. Now, however, evidence is emerging that the highly active antiretroviral therapy administered to HIV-positive patients might be responsible for the pulmonary hypertension. 118 ",

            "text": "The older high-oestrogen contraceptive drugs carried a slight risk of thromboembolism but this is not seen with the newer preparations. Pulmonary thromboembolism has also occurred with a drug-induced lupus syndrome associated with anticardiolipin antibodies. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as mitomycin may cause widespread smallvessel thrombosis resulting in the haemolytic-uraemic (thrombotic microangiopathic) syndrome. There is prominent involvement of pulmonary vessels and patients often suffer from respiratory as well as renal insufficiency, and pulmonary hypertension. The syndrome can develop during treatment or up to several months after the drug has been withdrawn. Pulmonary thromboembolism is also recorded as a complication of immunoglobulin infusion. 119 Non-traumatic fat embolism has resulted from the agglutination or 'creaming' of fat emulsions administered intravenously as a source of calories to debilitated patients. [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] The agglutinated liposomes occlude fine blood vessels throughout the body, causing effects such as priapism, osteonecrosis and pancreatitis. They may be demonstrated in the pulmonary capillaries but the lungs have considerable vascular reserve and it is uncertain what effect the vascular occlusion has on pulmonary function. Agglutination of these fat emulsions is particularly common in severely ill patients and this has been attributed to the elevated blood levels of acute-phase proteins, especially C-reactive protein, that are found in the very ill. The agglutination is also induced by calcium and may be brought about by administering calcium and other mineral supplements through the same venous line as the fat. Once agglutinated, the fat is less soluble and may be demonstrated in paraffin sections. Sudan black is especially useful for this purpose (Fig. 7.3.9 ). Microvascular crystal embolism is a further risk of parenteral nutrition, the crystals representing various calcium salts that may precipitate in the circulation. 126 Transient diffusion abnormalities attributed to oil embolism are very common in patients undergoing lymphangiography but serious respiratory impairment is limited to those patients with pre-existing lung disease or in whom substantial amounts of contrast medium are injected rapidly. [127] [128] [129] [130] Other emboli of an iatrogenic nature described in pulmonary arteries include the broken-off ends of intravenous catheters and cannulas, particles from dialysis tubing, 131 prosthetic implants of substances such as Teflon and silicone 88, [132] [133] [134] [135] and various materials injected to occlude abnormal blood vessels. 136, 137 Diffuse pulmonary haemorrhage Diffuse pulmonary haemorrhage may result from interference with the clotting mechanism by anticoagulants 138 or from widespread pulmonary capillaritis, the latter reported in leukaemic patients treated with retinoic acid. 139 Pulmonary haemorrhage has also been reported as an idiosyncratic reaction to lymphangiography media 140 and as a complication of immunoglobulin infusion, 141 while the development of anti-basement membrane antibodies resulting in Goodpasture's syndrome has been attributed to penicillamine. 141a",

            "text": "Reports of radiation-induced lung damage began to appear soon after ionising radiation became widely used in the treatment of malignant disease. [146] [147] [148] Despite refinements in radiotherapy techniques it is often impossible to avoid irradiating small areas of lung when treating cancer of the lung, breast, spine, thymus and oesophagus. Parts of the lungs are also included in 'mantle' irradiation of mediastinal lymph nodes affected by lymphoma. Occasionally, the whole of both lungs is irradiated, as in the treatment of widespread pulmonary metastases or as part of whole-body irradiation prior to marrow transplantation for the treatment of leukaemia. Radiation pneumonitis, usually localised, is estimated to affect about 8% of patients. 149 Therapeutic irradiation is given as divided doses over several weeks in order to minimise damage to adjacent tissue. The effects of such fractionated treatment are cumulative. In the lungs an early exudative phase soon passes and progressive damage becomes apparent only after months or even years. 150, 151 The changes are generally confined to the area of lung that is irradiated but are widespread when the whole body is irradiated prior to bone marrow transplantation or there is accidental whole-body irradiation. However, localised irradiation of the lung has been followed by abnormalities in non-irradiated areas. These include bilateral alveolar exudates, 152 migratory organising pneumonia affecting both lungs 153, 154 and fulminant bilateral interstitial pneumonia. 155 The likelihood of lung injury is increased by the simultaneous use of cytotoxic drugs and oxygen therapy. 156 Furthermore, chemotherapy following irradiation may result in exacerbation of the injury in areas previously irradiated, a phenomenon termed 'recall pneumonitis' . 157, 158 In the long term, irradiation also results in an increased incidence of lung carcinoma. This was seen in patients given therapeutic irradiation to the spine for ankylosing spondylitis 159 and is still encountered on occasion following irra diation for breast cancer. 160 The pathogenesis of radiation injury is described on page 146.",

The migratory organising pneumonia referred to above is an unusual further effect, as is chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. 68 In the pleura, radiation causes fibrinous effusions and adhesions. Pleural effusion and pulmonary oedema may be augmented by the long-term effects of radiation on the heart. Fulminant acute injury is an unusual and unexpected effect of therapeutic radiation but one that is likely to come to the attention of the pathologist as an autopsy is often requested. The clinical features are those of acute lung injury and the pathological changes are those of diffuse alveolar damage. The cause is likely to be accidental overdosage, augmentation of the radiation damage by accompanying oxygen therapy or treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Occasionally however these factors can be excluded, in which case the damage has to be ascribed to 'hypersensitivity' .",

            "text": "Although oxygen is necessary to life, it is cytotoxic in high concentrations. Severe hyperoxia damages DNA, inhibits cellular proliferation and ultimately kills cells. Its toxicity is thought to be due to the intracellular production of active oxygen radicals, some of which derive from activated neutrophils attracted to the site of injury. [167] [168] [169] [170] Under normal conditions most of the oxygen is reduced to water by cytochrome oxidase, and any active radicals produced are eliminated by superoxide dismutase, catalase and other antioxidants. However, these defence mechanisms may prove inadequate when active radicals are produced in excess. 171 Problems are likely to arise in clinical practice when lung disease necessitates the concentration of oxygen in the inspired air being raised in order to maintain normal blood levels of oxygen and prevent cerebral hypoxia. [172] [173] [174] A 'safe' level for oxygen administration is not firmly established and, because of species differences in susceptibility to oxygen, caution is needed in extrapolating from animal studies. However, animal experiments have shown that previous damage to the lungs renders them unduly sensitive to oxygen 175,176 and conversely that prior exposure to high levels of oxygen confers some resistance to subsequent oxygen exposure. 177 Clinical studies suggest that less than 50% oxygen (at atmospheric pressure) can be tolerated for long periods without ill effect. Little, if any, serious lung damage results from administration of 100% oxygen for up to 48 hours but concentrations between 50% and 100% carry a risk of damage if this period is exceeded. 171, 178 Extracorporeal oxygenation of the blood circumvents the problem but if it is to be prolonged it becomes a major undertaking that poses its own hazards; it is therefore generally reserved for patients who remain hypoxaemic despite other measures. 179 Intravenous blood oxygenators are employed to minimise the supplementation of inspired oxygen and partial liquid ventilation utilising perfluorocarbon has also been used. 180 Experimentally, disruption of CD40 binding to reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines has shown promising results in blunting oxygen-induced lung injury. 181 None of the morphological changes attributable to oxygen toxicity is specific. 174 The earliest ultrastructural change in experimental oxygen poisoning is swelling of endothelial cells, the cytoplasm of which becomes grossly oedematous and vacuolated. Swelling and fragmentation of type I epithelial cells follow and these cells become separated from their basement membrane, which is then coated by thin strands of protein. 178 This coating is replaced by proliferating type II cells by the 12th day. With recovery in room air the lungs practically return to normal. 182 The full clinical picture of oxygen poisoning is the acute respiratory distress syndrome and the corresponding pathological changes are those of diffuse alveolar damage, 174 as described on page 136.",

Although hypervolaemia is the commonest cause of pulmonary oedema after blood transfusion, transfusion-related acute lung injury is more often fatal. Platelet and white cell aggregates are known to develop in stored blood, but a relationship between the number of microaggregates transfused and the degree of respiratory impairment has not been convincingly demonstrated. Leukocyte antibodies are a more likely cause of lung injury in these patients. Such antibodies are often found in multiparous female donors as a result of sensitisation by fetal white cells during pregnancy. Alternatively, the recipient may have developed them during pregnancy or as a result of previous blood transfusions. The implicated antibodies are thought to initiate alveolar capillary damage within hours of transfusion by stimulating granulocyte aggregation. 183, 184 Electron microscopy has shown capillary endothelial damage with activated granulocytes in contact with alveolar basement membranes. 185 ",

Animal studies have shown that if one lung is excised early in life the enlargement is partly due to enhanced growth but later it represents only dilatation of existing air spaces. Hepatocyte growth factor is thought to be involved in the proliferation of residual lung cells following pneumonectomy. 211 Pulmonary complications include those typically seen after other thoracic procedures, such as haemorrhage and infection, and those unique to the postpneumonectomy state, namely anastomotic dehiscence and postpneumonectomy pulmonary oedema. The latter presents as the acute respiratory distress syndrome and represents the early stages of diffuse alveolar damage. It follows severe shift of the heart and mediastinum, which is commoner in children and young adults, in whom the tissues are more compliant. [212] [213] [214] [215] The condition complicates up to 4% of lung resections 216, 217 and is commoner following excision of the right lung when severe herniation of the left lung into the postpneumonectomy space stretches the trachea and left main bronchus and the latter is compressed between the left pulmonary artery in front and the arch of the aorta behind. In the long term the compression can result in bronchomalacia and postobstructive bronchiectasis. If postpneumonectomy oedema develops the immediate postoperative mortality is high -50% following pneumonectomy, 42% following lobectomy and 22% following sublobar resections. 217, 218 The pathogenesis is probably multifactorial but apart from factors such as fluid overload and high inspired oxygen concentrations there is probably an element of alveolar wall injury, induced by oxidant generation secondary to lung stretching and general surgical trauma. 219, 220 ",
