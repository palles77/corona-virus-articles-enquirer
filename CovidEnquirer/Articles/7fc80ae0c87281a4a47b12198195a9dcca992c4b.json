Moreover, the hazardous nature of low molecular weight azides, warrant the search for a simple, short, and high-yielding alternate protocol to synthesize substituted benzotriazoles.

The benzotriazenes (3a-f) on further treatment with CuI in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 led to the formation of various N 1 -subsituted benzotriazoles (4a-d, f) in good yields (Scheme 2).

In our early attempts to synthesize N 1 -substituted benzotriazole, we did not succeed in converting the benzotriazene intermediates into the desired products. The reaction was investigated carefully and we noticed that the intermediate formed after the coupling of diazonium salt of o-chloroaniline with amine 1 was not sufficiently stable. It was getting converted into p-aminoazoaryne, a thermodynamically favoured rearranged product after keeping at 45\u00b0C for a short period of time. Hence, the reaction was carried out at 20\u00b0C initially for 1 h to avoid decomposition and then allowed further to continue at 55\u00b0C. Having established a protocol for the synthesis of benzotriazole derivatives, we shifted our focus toward the role of solvents like CH 2 Cl 2 , CHCl 3 , DMF, and toluene upon yield and the reaction time. The results illustrated that the reaction in toluene did not give the desired benzotriazole, whereas, the reaction in CHCl 3 was slow and did not proceed smoothly. However, for this cyclization CH 2 Cl 2 was found to be good in terms of yield and handling but took a slightly longer time to afford the products. Eventually, DMF emerged as a solvent of choice for N-arylation of o-chloro-1,2,3-benzotriazenes by affording the desired product in very good yield. N-Arylation reactions are greatly influenced by the base used, therefore, to find out the appropriate base, we examined K 2 CO 3 and Cs 2 CO 3 in the cyclization reaction of 3a and found that the reaction in the presence of K 2 CO 3 afforded the N 1 -substituted benzotriazole in 72% yield after a prolonged reaction (10 h) whereas Cs 2 CO 3 gave this product in 80% yield. We believe that carbonate with a bigger counter cation may be more dissociated in aprotic solvents and consequently is more reactive. In order to enhance the yield further, we reviewed some more bases and noticed that for a similar type of cyclization, DABCO with ligand 1,10-phenanthroline has been successfully used. 16 When the cyclization reaction 3a was carried out with DABCO in presence of 1,10-phenanthroline ligand, the yield of N 1 -substituted benzotriazole dropped drastically from 80% to 30% (Table 1) . Therefore we explored another ligand, 1,8naphthyridine which provides a 1,3 chelating site but this also gave a poor yield of the product.",

The failure of the reaction to afford the desired product confirmed the feasibility of this cyclization only under the catalysis of CuI. Then the cyclization of 3a through diacetoxyiodobenzene 17 was tried and the reaction again did not occur smoothly and yielded the compound 4a in trace amounts. All the above studies suggest that CuI in combination with Cs 2 CO 3 in anhydrous DMF is well suited for intramolecular N-arylation reaction. In another reaction, o-chloroaniline 1 was coupled in situ with its own diazonium salt to afford intermediate o-chloro-1,2,3-benzotriazene 3b in good yield which on treatment with CuI/Cs 2 CO 3 in anhydrous DMF afforded 2-cholorophenyl benzotriazole 4b in good yield (78%). Unfortunately similar CuI-catalyzed cyclization reaction with benzyl-substituted compound did not provide the desired benzotriazole. Under similar reaction conditions a series of diverse N 1 -substituted benzotriazoles (4a-d, and f) were obtained in good to high yields using different amines such as p-toluedine, o-chloroaniline, p-anisidine, aniline, and 2-napthylamine (Scheme 2). 18 In conclusion, a simple, efficient and novel method has been developed for an easy access to diverse N 1 -aryl benzotriazoles through intramolecular N-arylation of different o-chloro-1,2,3benzotriazenes using CuI/Cs 2 CO 3 . The protocol offers several advantages including (a) mild reaction conditions; (b) simple work-up procedure; (c) moderately high yields of the desired products; and finally (d) the use of explosive azides is avoided. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of this kind of intramolecular N-arylation reaction for an easy access to functionalized benzotriazoles. Efforts to widen the scope of the process on fused heterocycles as well as carbohydrate-based molecules of great chemotherapeutic value are under progress in our laboratory.",
