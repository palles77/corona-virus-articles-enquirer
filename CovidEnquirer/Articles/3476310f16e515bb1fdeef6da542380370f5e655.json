            "text": "Background/Purpose: As a result of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, the World Health Organization placed Taiwan on the travel alert list from May 21 to July 5, 2003. The aim of this study was to explore the post-crisis psychological distress among residents in Taiwan after the SARS epidemic. Methods: The target population consisted of a nationwide representative sample of residents aged \u2265 18 years. Data were collected using computer assisted telephone interview systems by stratified random sampling according to geographic area. The survey (n = 1278) was conducted in November 2003, about 4 months after resolution of the SARS crisis in Taiwan. The maximum deviation of sampling error at the 95% confidence level was \u00b1 2.74%. Psychological distress was measured by a question related to subject's changes in perception of life, plus the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the correlation of psychological distress. Results: About 9.2% of the participants reported that their perceptions of life became more pessimistic following the SARS crisis. The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 11.7%. Major predictors of higher levels of pessimism after the SARS epidemic included demographic factors, perception of SARS and preparedness, knowing people or having personal experiences of SARS-related discrimination, and individual worries and psychiatric morbidity. The correlates of symptomatic cases, as indicated by the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, included age \u2265 50 years, senior high school graduate, and worries about recurrence of SARS. Conclusion: Psychological distress was significantly correlated with demographic factors and perception regarding the SARS epidemic. It is suggested that marketing of mental health education should be segmented according to age and education level, which should enhance crisis communication for newly emerging infectious diseases among community populations.",

[2] [3] [4] Notably, the uncertainty and rapid spread of the SARS pandemic increased the worldwide media coverage. 5, 6 It also heightened the anxiety and fear of the SARS outbreak. 7 Nosocomial infection was a major route of transmission for the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. 8, 9 A number of studies on the psychological impact of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan have focused on the psychiatric morbidity of hospital staff, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] for example, post-traumatic stress disorder, 10, 15 and decreased utilization of medical services. [16] [17] [18] Relatively few researchers have conducted studies related to the psychological responses of SARS among the general population. 7, 19 Mental health plays an important role in managing new EIDs like SARS. The fear of SARS could increase panic 7 and lead to social stigmatization. [20] [21] [22] [23] In particular, effective crisis communication is important to mitigate the fear of new EIDs. The challenge of communication about the risk of EIDs was one of the lessons learned from the experience of SARS. 24 As new diseases have been emerging at an unprecedented rate, it is vital to maintain continued vigilance by delivering the most accurate information successfully and unambiguously. 24 Research on the post-crisis response merits further discussion of the pre-crisis preparedness for the emergence of the next new disease.",

Hence, nearly 80% of the participants reported having received SARS-related health education information from the media in the past 2 weeks prior to the time of the telephone survey. However, only 64% of the participants in this study held the belief that current medical technology could prolong the lives of patients suffering from SARS. This is in contrast to the actual fatality rate of SARS patients in Taiwan, which was 10.7%. 28 Such a discrepancy between the true and perceived fatality rate might be due to a public risk perception that is based more on rumors and anecdotes than scientific evidence. A recent study has shown that the perceived threat, vulnerability and response efficacy for SARS varied between countries in Europe and Asia. 29 A total of 668 probable SARS cases were diagnosed between March 14 and July 30, 2003 in Taiwan. 30 The impact of the epidemic on the country's medical and social system was tremendous. Fear was widespread. For example, despite the fact that none of the probable SARS cases were discovered in the communities of indigenous peoples (2% of Taiwan's population are Austronesian aborigines, mostly living in remote mountains), 42.6-50.9% of indigenous community residents reported that their daily life was affected by the SARS epidemic. 31 The prevalence of BSRS-5-defined psychiatric morbidity in our study population was found to be 11.7%. As expected, this was lower than that of hospital staff, with psychiatric morbidity among hospital workers ranging from 18 to 57%, depending on their level of involvement with SARS patients, and with the highest prevalence in hospitals that had nosocomial transmission of SARS. 12 The post-crisis prevalence (11.7%) in 2003 was higher than the prevalence in the general population (8.8%) after 2003, 32 but considerably lower than that of HIV-infected prison inmates (46.1%). 33 It is very likely that negative life events also influence BSRS scores.

It is also noteworthy that limited information exists with regard to the potential importance of life events in predicting psychiatric morbidity such as depression, 38 which warrants further exploration. The potential recall bias might be inevitable for certain elderly respondents. However, the fact that 76.6% of the respondents received SARS-related health education information from the media in the 2 weeks prior to the survey reduces this potential recall bias. Another potential selection bias is due to the 593 non-respondents. Yet, weighted samples were used in the analysis to ensure that the estimates reflected the general population.
