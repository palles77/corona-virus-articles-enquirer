            "text": "Combination antiretroviral therapy fails in complete suppression of HIV-1 due to drug resistance and persistent latency. Novel therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible for viral replication, specifically those untargeted by antiretroviral drugs. An understudied phenomenon is the nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein, which completes nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced/partially spliced HIV mRNA through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets-the Rev-response element (RRE). Rev contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) comprising the COOH terminus of the arginine-rich motif for accumulation within nucleoli-speculated as the interaction ground for Rev with cellular proteins mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. Functionality of Rev nucleolar access during HIV-1 production and infection was investigated in the context of deletion and single-point mutations within Rev-NoLS. Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle. HIV-1 HXB2 replication ceased with Rev mutations lacking nucleolar access due to loss or replacement of multiple arginine residues. Rev mutations missing single arginine residues remained strictly nucleolar in pattern and participated in proviral production, however, with reduced efficiency. Viral RNA packaging also decreased in efficiency after expression of nucleolar-localizing mutations. These results were observed during propagation of variant HIV-1 NL4-3 containing nucleolar-localizing mutations within the viral backbone (M4, M5, and M6). Lentiviral particles produced with Rev single-point mutations were transducible at extremely low frequency. Similarly, HIV-1 NL4-3 Rev-NoLS variants lost infectivity, unlike virulent WT (wild type) HIV-1 NL4-3 . HIV-1 NL4-3 variants were capable of CD4 + host entry and reverse transcription as WT HIV-1 NL4-3 , but lacked ability to complete a full infectious cycle. We currently reveal that viral integration is deregulated in the presence of Rev-NoLS mutations.",

U16Rz was expressed in HeLa T4, where nucleolar specificity was observed. Upon HIV challenge, nucleolar U16Rz strongly suppressed HIV-1 production, 22 selectively cleaving unspliced and partially spliced transcripts that traversed through the nucleolus to the sequestered ribozyme. Similarly, modified U16Rz targeting both U5 and gag (RzC36) significantly reduced viral production in CEM during HIV challenge. 23 The potent catalytic activity of nucleolar-specific U16Rz against HIV RRE-containing transcripts suggests an HIV-1 nucleolar pathway facilitated through Rev nucleocytoplasmic activity.",

We currently reveal that Rev nucleolar access is necessary for the completion of the HIV-1 infectious cycle. Nucleolar activity allows efficient HIV-1 mRNA splicing and nucleocytoplasmic transport. In the background of Rev nucleolar mutations, the frequency of viral integration increases dramatically in comparison to WT (wild type) HIV-1. Extreme integration frequencies result in cell death and the arrest of the HIV-1 infectious cycle. We further demonstrate the loss of Rev interaction with B23 as a result of nucleolar mutations, and discuss the involvement of B23 in other viral infectious models requiring nucleolar access for infectivity.",

The HIV-1 mRNA splicing machinery was initially examined, as HIV-1 mRNA splicing is dependent on the host mRNA-splicing machinery to produce three mRNA species for expression of proteins required in viral assembly and release-unspliced 9 kb mRNA, partially spliced 4 kb mRNA, and fully spliced 2 kb mRNA. Upon infection and viral integration into host genomes, fully spliced viral mRNA leads to expression of Tat, Rev, and Nef. Rev in turn achieves nucleocytoplasmic transport of RREcontaining RNAs through affinity with CRM1, involved in an mRNA-independent nuclear export pathway. 50 Rev transports partially spliced viral mRNA to the cytoplasm for expression of Vif, Vpr, and Vpu accessory proteins. Rev additionally stabilizes and transports unspliced viral mRNA to encode Gag and Gag-/Pol-derived proteins; unspliced HIV mRNA serves as viral genomic RNA to be packaged within viral particles for release and re-infection of other hosts. It is currently unknown if HIV-1 mRNA stabilization for this process involves a nucleolar pathway mediated by the nucleocytoplasmic activity of Rev. Rev-NoLS single-point mutations and deletions corresponding to nucleolar-localizing M4, M5, M6, and M8 were induced within the HIV-1 NL4-3 backbone. HIV-1 mRNA splicing was observed as a result of nucleolar mutations to further understand the role of the nucleolus on viral mRNA splicing.",

We next tested the ability of mutant viral particles to achieve host cell entry, quantified through intraviral EGFP-Vpr infectious transfer. The direct cellular uptake of HIV-1 virions to the CD4 surface receptor has been observed with fluorescence microscopy by copackaging EGFP-Vpr fusion protein to create GFP + HIV particles. 51 EGFP-Vpr was later utilized to monitor virion uptake into CD4 + and CD4 -HeLa cells during HIV-1 Nef regulation of viral entry into the host cytoplasm. 52 Thus, we implemented this technique to quantify the cellular uptake of GFP + HIV-1 particles co-packaged with our Rev-NoLS variants. HIV-1 NL4-3 cDNA-WT or Rev-NoLS variants-was co-packaged with EGFP-vpr vector to propagate fluorescent viral particles. CEM and CD4 + HeLa T4 cells were subjected to infection with 1 lg p24 supernatant for 1.5 h, preserved, and quantified for EGFP positivity using FACS analysis.

Cre-loxP dual fluorescent reporters indicate lentiviral entry, reverse transcription, and integration in the background of Rev-NoLS mutations. An HT1080 reporter cell line was generated to test for viral entry, reverse transcription, and transgene integration. HT1080 reporters contain a LoxP-mCFP-LoxP-TagRFP (XCXR) gene cassette, which undergoes conversion from mCFP (cyan) to TagRFP (red) upon the viral delivery of Cre protein (A). The viral delivery system packages Cre-Vpr fusion protein expressed from a Tat-responsive lentiviral vector (HIV LTR-Cre-Vpr fusion-IRES-Tat/ GFP fusion or CVITG) (B). CVITG lentiviral vector was co-expressed with Gag/Pol and VSV-G packaging vectors 91 , and a-flag-tagged Rev-NoLS mutations (M4, M5, and M6) in HEK293T. Viral supernatant was collected 48 h later and quantified using p24 ELISA antigen capture assays. Rev-NoLS mutations M4, M5, and M6 function in lentiviral production, but not as efficiently as WT Rev (C). XCXR were transduced with 10 lg CVITG Cre-Vpr lentivirus. CFP transition to RFP from lentiviral transduction was assessed using FACS analysis 7 days post-transduction. CVITG lentivirus co-packaged with M4, M5, and M6 Rev variants induced TagRFP expression at extremely low frequency; this was an indicator of lentiviral entry (D, E). Control experiments using WT Rev with reverse transcriptase inhibitor (AZT) and/or integrase inhibitor (118-D-24) served as negative controls for CVITG transduction, and demonstrated the functionality of the system to detect viral entry, reverse transcription, and integration (F, G). HT1080 (-) represents an additional cell population used as negative controls for RFP and CFP expression. XCXR (-) represents a negative control population of reporter cells that are not transduced with CVITG lentivirus. AZT, azidothymidine; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; RFP, red fluorescent protein.",

Exon definition and bridging between 5\u00a2ss and 3\u00a2ss lead to formation of an early, irreversible splicing complex (E complex), resulting in splicing reactions. 62, 63 Core splicing signals are surrounded by cis-elements that either enhance (exonic splicing enhancers [ESEs]) or repress (exonic splicing silencers [ESSs]) exon definition during alternative splicing reactions. 64, 65 ESEs are sequence elements within exons that interact with serine-arginine-rich splicing factors (SR proteins). ESSs interact with the heterogeneous ribonuclear splicing inhibitors (hnRNP) to repress exon definition.

            "text": "We observed that Rev single-point mutations decrease the cytoplasmic export of the 9 kb HIV-1 mRNA, thereby leading to the decrease of p24 production, since p24 is derived from gag/pol precursors of 9 kb mRNA. 46, 71 Two amino acid deletions of M8 did not significantly change the levels of the 9 kb mRNA, although disproportionately higher levels of 2 and 4 kb mRNA splice variants were observed. Impairment of Rev in facilitating nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced and partially spliced transcripts could result in the accumulation of fully spliced 2 kb transcripts, which encode Tat, Rev, and Nef proteins. Therefore, an increase of Tat expression would activate the Tat-positive feedback loop, leading to the enhanced transactivation of HIV gene expression and the subsequent accumulation of 2 and 4 kb mRNAs. 6, 72 This is also consistent with computational models, which predict an increase of 2, 4, and 9 kb transcripts upon inhibition of Rev. 73 The proportionality of spliced/unspliced mRNA variants may be a prerequisite for viral production and infection. In addition, host cell protein interactions with Rev in the nucleolus may regulate HIV mRNA transport and splicing. Nucleolar B23 is involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Rev-bound HIV mRNA and is well characterized in its interactions with the NoLS of host factors-p120 growth factor (amino acids 40-57) 74 and C23 pre-rRNA processor (amino acids 540-628) 75 -and retroviral proteins HTLV-1 Rex (amino acids 1-22) 76 and HIV-1 Tat (amino acids [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . 77 Currently, we reveal that Rev-NoLS single-point mutations abolished B23 interaction with Rev. This may lead to the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HIV mRNAs. We also reveal that the loss of B23 interaction with Rev does not hinder viral production, yet diminishes viral infectivity, suggesting that other nucleolar factors are involved in viral production.",

B23 is characterized in interactions with NoLS of cellular factors for nucleocytoplasmic transport-p120 growth factor (amino acids [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] 74 and C23 pre-rRNA processor (amino acids 540-628) 75 -and with retroviral proteins HTLV-1 Rex (amino acids 1-22), 76 HIV-1 Tat (amino acids 49-57), 77 and HIV-1 Rev (amino acids 37-47). 83 Juvenile Encephalitis virus (JEV) infection is transmitted through mosquito vectors, leading to acute encephalitis in humans. The JEV genome encodes a nucleolar-localizing core protein, through which amino acids Gly42 and Pro43 interact with N-terminal region of B23 during JEV infection, resulting in transportation of viral core protein/B23 into the nucleus. 84 The single-strand RNA HBV causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma during infection. The HBV genome is composed partially of double-stranded DNA, which encodes a nucleolar core protein. HBV core protein associates with nucleolin and B23 in the nucleolus 85 ; B23 was demonstrated in HBV assembly through interaction with the core protein Nterminal domain. Specifically, B23 amino acids 259-294 bind the N-terminal domain of HBV core protein to allow viral encapsidation. 86 The negative-sense, single-strand RNA hepatitis D virus (HDV) expresses HDVAg antigen in two isoforms; the small isoform aids in RNA replication and the large isoform facilitates viral assembly. RNA replication takes place within the nucleolus and requires B23 interaction with HDVAg. 87, 88 HDV infection causes an upregulation of B23, which interacts mostly with the small HDVAg isoform and less with the large HDVAg isoform. Interactions take place through the small HDVAg NLS domain, through which B23 binds and achieves nuclear accumulation. Upon deletion of HDV binding site to B23, RNA replication was impaired. HDVAg was shown to co-localize with B23 and nucleolin in the nucleolus. Nucleolin was discovered to possess transcriptional properties as a repressor, 89 revealing the nucleolus as a compartment for regulation of HDV replication.",

HIV-1 NL4-3 backbone containing the nucleolar-localizing M8 deletion did not yield viral particles and was therefore used in this study as a negative control along with the pcDNA negative control. JLTRG-R5 was subjected to infection with 2 ng p24 viral supernatant containing each HIV-1 NL4-3 variant and washed 24 h later with 2\u00b7 HBSS (Hank's balanced salt solution). Infected cells were resupplemented in RPMI media. JLTRG-R5 was collected afterward at 5-day intervals postinfection.HIV-infected cells were measured for EGFP positivity(inducible upon Tat expression after integration) using fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Unlike infectious WT HIV-1 NL4-3 , variants of HIV-1 NL4-3 harboring single-point mutations (M4, M5, and M6) lacked the ability to replicate and produce abundant Tat for the internal activation of LTR-EGFP. Low frequency in LTR-EGFP activation after replication of HIV-1 NL4-3 variants, unlike WT HIV-1 NL4-3 , was evident up to 20 days postinfection (Fig. 3C). During the replication peak at day 15, HIV-1 NL4-3 variants exhibited significant defects in replication compared to WT \u2030 FIG. 3. HIV-1 NL4-3 harboring Rev nucleolar single-point mutations are unable to complete a full infectious cycle. Mutations corresponding to Rev-NoLS M4, M5, M6, and M8-all nucleolar in pattern-were induced within HIV-1 NL4-3 cDNA and used to propagate virus. Virus was collected 48 h later and quantified using p24 ELISA antigen capture assays. Single-point mutations within HIV-1 NL4-3 backbone (M4, M5, and M6) allowed viral production to occur, however, not as efficiently as WT HIV-1 NL4-3 (A). Viral supernatant (20 ng p24) was subjected to bDNA assays using probe specific to vif of packaged genomic RNA. Single-point mutations within HIV-1 NL4-3 backbone did not prevent viral RNA packaging within viral particles (B). HIV-1 NL4-3 particles (2 ng p24 viral supernatant) harboring nucleolar mutations (M4, M5, and M6) within the viral backbone were examined for replication and infectivity of CD4 + JLTRG-R5 at 5-day intervals postinfection. HIV-infected cells were measured for EGFP positivity using FACS analysis. Unlike infectious WT HIV-1 NL4-3 , HIV-1 NL4-3 variants lacked the ability to replicate up to 20 days postinfection (C). HIV-1 NL4-3 variants exhibited defects in the ability to replicate and infect JLTRG-R5 compared to WT HIV-1 NL4-3 , which infected 20% of the entire cell population at the day 15 infectious peak (D). HIV-1 NL4-3 variants replicated and infected host cells at extremely low frequency at the 15-day time point (N = 3 during unpaired t-tests, E). Quantification of infected JLTRG-R5 is as follows for WT versus HIV1 NL4-3 variants: M4 p value = .01, M5 p value = .01, and M6 p value = .01. Ability of HIV-1 NL4-3 variants to gain function into the HIV-1 infectious cycle was monitored through p24 viral output. Viral supernatant from infected JLTRG-R5 was collected at 4-day intervals until 32 days postinfection. Unlike infectious WT HIV-1 NL4-3 , HIV-1 NL4-3 variants lacked ability to fully regain functionality and infectivity up to 32 days postinfection (F). This was also evident upon examination of genomic DNA harvested from HIV-infected JLTRG-R5 (WT HIV-1 NL4-3 vs. single-point variants). Genomic DNA was collected every 5 days postinfection for 25 days and subjected to PCR amplification for detection of total HIV DNA and preintegrated 2-LTR circles. Total HIV DNA was undetectable from JLTRG-R5 infected with NL4-3 variants (M4, M5, M6, and M8), unlike detectable total HIV DNA from WT HIV-1 NL4-3 starting at day 15 (G). Preintegrated 2-LTR circles accumulated in the presence of WT HIV-1 NL4-3 infection beginning at day 15; 2-LTR circles were not detected in DNA genomic samples from the NL4-3 variants.
