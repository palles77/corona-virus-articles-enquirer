This paper reports an evaluation of the knowledge, attitude, practices and sources of information relating to SARS among physicians who staffed the SARS fever hotline service. A retrospective survey was conducted using a self-administered postal questionnaire. Participants were physicians who staffed a SARS hotline during the SARS epidemic in Taipei, Taiwan from June 1 to 10, 2003. A response rate of 83% was obtained. All respondents knew the causative agent of SARS, and knowledge regarding SARS features and preventive practices was good. However, only 54% of respondents knew the incubation period of SARS. Hospital guidelines and news media were the major information sources. In responding to two case scenarios most physicians were likely to triage callers at high risk of SARS appropriately, but not callers at low risk. Less than half of all respondents answered both scenarios correctly. The results obtained suggest that knowledge of SARS was generally good although obtained from both medical and non-medical sources. Specific knowledge was however lacking in certain areas and this affected the ability to appropriately triage callers. Standardized education and assessment of prior knowledge of SARS could improve the ability of physicians to triage callers in future outbreaks.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] The SARS fever hotline, staffed by physicians, was introduced in June 2003 to advise callers regarding SARS, and refer them to appropriate healthcare service when necessary.",

The overall objective was prompt recognition of persons at high risk for SARS, thereby limiting the risk of possible transmission to others. In conjunction with this campaign, persons with fever or other features associated with SARS were encouraged to call a dedicated SARS fever hotline, which began operating on June 1, 2003. The purpose of the fever hotline was to prevent unnecessary visits to hospital and clinics. The hotline had a tollfree number and was staffed by physicians from the local medical association working 6-hour shifts between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Physicians triaged calls using an algorithm developed by members of the local medical association.",

The questionnaire included questions related to respondent demographics; SARS information source; knowledge about SARS; attitude towards, and beliefs about the hotline; and scenarios on referral practices. The questionnaire was developed in English, piloted, and translated into Mandarin Chinese, with translation and backtranslation being undertaken independently by bilingual public health professionals. 5 Questionnaires were sent to the physicians on July 9, 2003. Telephone reminders were made on July 16, and July 22. These were followed by a postal reminder to non-responders on July 25.",

Not knowing the incubation period may have led the physicians to inappropriately triage persons with fever. In addition, there was a disparity in the level of knowledge among the hotline staff. The variety of medical and non-medical sources of information about SARS may have been responsible. Research has shown that staff providing telephone advice should have the appropriate knowledge and training to deal with calls. 8 Standardized education and competency training before staffing the hotline would improve the quality of information provided by hotline physicians. Physicians obtained their information about SARS mainly from hospital guidelines and the news media. It is possible that the information from either or both of these sources was incorrect. An evaluation of the content of the news media and the hospital guidelines is beyond the scope of this study, but is an area of potential future research. Less than half of the respondents would have dealt with both clinical scenarios appropriately using the standardized algorithm. The algorithm was distributed to the physicians without prior training. Poor triaging may be due to an incorrect algorithm or lack of training in how to use it correctly.",

Furthermore, telephone triage has been shown to be an effective means of managing demand for healthcare as it can be used to provide patient information, patient education and provide guided access to appropriate healthcare. 9, 10 There are a number of limitations to this study. Firstly, the survey relied on self-reporting and may therefore not truly reflect practice. Secondly, the results are based on small numbers. However the response rate was high at over 80%. Thirdly, although the questionnaire was translated and back-translated, linguistic or cultural differences may have led respondents to misunderstand a number of questions.",
