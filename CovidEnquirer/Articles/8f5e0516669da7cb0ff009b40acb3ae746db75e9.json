Additionally, those calves were hypoglycemic from 4 to 12 h after the challenge with the degree of hypoglycemia inversely related to the dose of the E. coli. All calves challenged with E. coli had decreased plasma zinc concentrations, and the magnitude was inversely proportional to the challenge dose. There were treatment \u00d7 time interactions (P < 0.001) on rectal temperatures following the challenge.

            "text": "It is well documented that dairy calves are highly susceptible to disease and early mortality (Roy, 1990) . Enteric disease is the primary cause of pre-weaning morbidity and mortality, and many enteric pathogens can cause bacteremia and septicemia among dairy calves. Thirty-one percent of scouring calves were bacteremic and survival rates were low, only 12% (Lofstedt et al., 1999) . In agreement, Fecteau et al. (1997) in 2 experiments observed that 24 and 31% of severely ill calves were bacteremic and the mortality of blood culture positive calves was greater, 57.4%, versus 15.1% for blood culture negative calves. Fecteau et al. (2001) reported that of the 51 bacterial isolates, 51% were Escherichia coli, 25.5% from other gram negative enterics, 5.9% gram negative anaerobes, 11.8% gram positive cocci, and 5.9% gram positive rods. The high mortality in blood culture bacteria positive calves could be associated with septic shock due to an over-aggressive systemic acute phase response.",

Immediate administration of antibiotic and therapeutic treatments would need to be implemented for a septicemic calf; however, differentiating between a septicemic and non-septicemic calf with scours is difficult based on clinical observations alone (Fecteau et al., 1997) . There is a need for an inexpensive and rapid on-farm test that can accurately and precisely identify septicemic calves. The objective of the present study was to characterize the pathogenesis of septicemia in colostrum-fed Jersey calves and identify any potential biochemical markers indicative of septicemia.",

Twenty Jersey bull calves (1 \u00b1 1 d of age) were acquired from a local commercial dairy in January 2010 and transported 130 km to the Livestock Issue Research Unit calf facility in Liberty, TX. The calves were given 4 quarts of pooled colostrum within the first 12 h of life. Cows in the herd are routinely vaccinated against rotavirus, coronavirus, and the J-5 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core and K99+ antigens of E. coli. Peripheral blood samples were collected immediately upon arrival and serum collected and quantified for total serum protein using a temperature controlled refractometer (Atago Inc., Bellevue, WA). Antibodies to the J-5 LPS core antigen could have attenuated the response in the current study if compared with calves that received colostrum from cows that were not vaccinated against the J-5 LPS core antigen or did not receive colostrum (Deluyker et al., 2004) . Calves were individually housed in stainless steel pens (1 m \u00d7 2 m) with a slotted rubber mat floor in a thermo-controlled room (ranged from 20.3 to 21.9 \u2022 C). The calf nursery was illuminated with fluorescent lighting 24 h a day. All calves were fed 454 g/d as-fed of a commercial, non-medicated, 20% fat and 20% all milk protein, milk replacer (Lawley's Inc., Stockton, CA) for a 21-d adaptation period. During this period, calves with scours were treated therapeutically with acidified oral electrolytes (Bluelite C, Tech Mix, Stewart, MN) and bismuth subsalicylate added directly to the milk replacer. Calves were fed twice daily at 0800 and 1630 h.",

The E. coli expressed the intimin and shiga-like toxin 1 genes. The challenge doses included 0, 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 , 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 , 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 , 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 , and 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 colony-forming units (CFU) given as a bolus by venapuncture in 5 mL of sterile isotonic saline immediately following the AM feeding. The challenge doses were prepared from a 12 h, log-growth culture in tryptic soy broth. Briefly, 40 mL of tryptic soy broth was inoculated with a pure culture of the E. coli O111:H8 from a Microbank bead (Pro-lab Diagnostics, Austin, TX). The culture was incubated for 12 h at 37 \u2022 C and 200 rpm. The quantity of free LPS was determined in duplicate cultures, grown under the same conditions used in the challenge culture, by a commercial laboratory (Nelson Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT) using the limulus amebocyte lysate method. Confirmation of challenge doses was performed approximately 30 min before the challenge was administered by spread plating serial dilutions. The range of the E. coli challenge doses was based on data from Smith and Halls (1968) , and 21 d old calves were used in the current study to ensure that all calves were free of any clinical signs of enteric or systemic disease. Additionally, a 48 h observation period was evaluated based on the clinical course of the disease observed by Smith and Halls (1968) after various challenge strains of E. coli were administered intravenously. The E. coli O111:H8 strain was chosen in the present study because our lab has used it in our phagocytic and oxidative burst assays and it was shown to be rapidly phagocytized and produce a robust oxidative burst (Hulbert et al., 2011) .",

Control serum (Randox Laboratories, Jefferson City, WV) was used to calculate the inter-assay coefficients of variations of 4.5 and 5.8% for plasma glucose and urea nitrogen, respectively. Intra-assay coefficients of variations were 3.7 and 4.2% for plasma glucose and urea nitrogen, respectively. Plasma cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, interleukin-6, and interferon-\u2425, were measured using a multi-plexed sandwich-based chemiluminescence ELISA (Searchlight-Aushon Biosystems, Inc., Billerica, MA). The inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variations were 9.2 and 12.1%, respectively. Plasma haptoglobin was quantified as described by Makimura and Suzuki (1982) . The interand intra-assay coefficients of variation for the haptoglobin assay were 1.8 and 1.9%, respectively. Plasma zinc concentrations were analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Smimadzu AA-6300, Columbia, MD) after plasma protein was precipitated by mixing equal volumes of plasma and 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubating at 100 \u2022 C for 20 min. Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 2.1 and 2.6%, respectively.",

The 2 largest doses of E. coli O111:H8 used in this study induced acute signs of septicemia including sickness behavior, febrile responses, increased peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines, hypoglycemia, and leucopenia. Many of the responses were dose dependent. Calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 CFU displayed severely depressed behaviors while calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU became recumbent and 2 of the 3 calves had no reaction to stimuli during their peak response. The greatest scores for sickness behaviors among calves treated with the two highest doses occurred between 3 and 4.5 h postchallenge; after which these calves began to recover. Calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 CFU had recovered within 7 h, but the latency until recovery for calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU was longer, occurring within 32 h. Smith and Halls (1968) also observed immediate sickness behaviors in both colostrum deprived and adequate Jersey calves when challenged intravenously with 10 9.7 CFU of E. coli 078:K80, which persisted from 1-5 h post-challenge. In the current study, the hypoglycemia was more severe in calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU than those challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 CFU. Dose dependent clinical and biochemical responses to endotoxin were observed in cattle, but it was dependent on the response variable (Jacobsen et al., 2004) . This is evident in the current study where the magnitude and temporal response of the leucopenia were similar for calves challenged with either of the two high doses of E. coli. The acute responses observed in these animals was similar to those observed when Jersey calves are challenged with purified LPS; however, the febrile response was sustained through 48 h post-challenge using the live pathogen; whereas rectal temperatures in Jersey calves returned to baseline within 24 h after the LPS challenge in a previous study (Ballou et al., 2008) . It is probable that the acute signs of septicemia in the calves challenged with either 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 or 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU were at least partially attributable to the concentrations of free LPS in the challenge preparations.",

Calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU had the greatest peaks in rectal temperatures, which occurred 11-14 h post-challenge. The greater magnitude in febrile response observed in these calves may have occurred in response to an attenuated counter anti-inflammatory response. A robust counter anti-inflammatory response is often observed during endotoxemia and septicemia (Ejima et al., 2003) . Although calves challenged with either 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 or 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 CFU did not display any sickness behaviors or changes in leucocytes or biochemical responses during the 48 h post-challenge observation period, they did develop dose-dependent febrile and decreased plasma zinc concentration responses. Calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 CFU displayed a slight febrile response from 20 to 35 h post-challenge; whereas calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 CFU had febrile responses of greater magnitude and length, lasting from 10 to 35 h post-challenge. These data indicate calves challenged with less than or equal to 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU developed acute phase responses, but did not become septicemic. This could be a reflection of the good colostrum status of these calves or the E. coli O111:H8 used in the current study. These data also indicate that rectal temperatures and plasma zinc concentrations are very sensitive indicators of infection, but not necessarily specific for septicemia.",

Peripheral inflammation during septicemia and endotoxemia can directly activate the central nervous system and alter the thermoregulatory center of the brain (Givalois et al., 1994) ; however, in localized inflammation, febrile responses are still observed, even in the absence of peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines (Zhang et al., 2008) . The current data indicate that the febrile and decreased plasma zinc concentration responses during infection without concurrent septicemia were independent of peripheral concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u2423 and IL-6. Additionally, the leucopenia and increased plasma haptoglobin concentrations in calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU were not influenced by peripheral cytokine concentrations. In contrast, it is well documented in rats and humans that acute phase protein synthesis is responsive to the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u2423 and IL-1 and IL-6 (Koj, 1985; Gabay et al., 1996) . Furthermore, IL-6 is considered a major inducer of acute phase protein synthesis (Heinrich et al., 1990) . Despite elevations in haptoglobin observed at 12 and 24 h post-challenge in the 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU challenged calves, the current data indicate that the intermediate dose of E. coli O111:H8, 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU, had the greatest and most sustained increase in plasma haptoglobin. Localized inflammation or other peripheral factors not measured in the current study may have influenced the response. The greater response observed in calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU could be due to less of an acute counter anti-inflammatory response that was likely observed in calves challenged with either 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 or 10 9 CFU.",

            "text": "Peripheral concentrations of IFN-\u2425 were elevated in calves challenged with greater or equal to 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 CFU; however, the responses were dose dependent. Calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU had acute responses with greatest elevation of IFN-\u2425 at 4 h. Previous research from our laboratories has shown that IFN-\u2425 concentrations in plasma increase following an intravenous LPS challenge among beef calves, peaking at 4-5 h and returning to baseline concentrations within 12 h (Carroll et al., 2009) . The concentrations of IFN-\u2425 in plasma of these Jersey calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU were approximately 10 fold higher than observed by Carroll et al. (2009) (990 versus 120 pg/mL). The current data taken together with the data from Carroll et al. (2009) suggest that some immunogens from the live culture are stimulating IFN-\u2425 secretion in addition to what is observed from LPS alone. The source of the IFN-\u2425 measured in plasma is unknown, but could either come from direct stimulation of natural killer cells or activated T-lymphocytes. In addition, calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 CFU, having displayed clinical, hematological, and biochemical responses indicative of septicemia had a very different temporal IFN-\u2425 response, peaking at 12 h and returning to baseline within 48 h post challenge, than that observed in calves challenged with either 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU or purified LPS (Carroll et al., 2009) . The temporal response observed in calves challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 CFU was similar to that for calves challenged with either 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 or 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU. The more delayed cytokine response observed among these calves is likely a reflection of the link between the innate and adaptive immune responses, but secretion from natural killer cells cannot be ruled out. Similar temporal results have been observed in rats challenged with Streptococcus pneumonia and furthermore using interferon-\u2425 knock-outs they were able to show a protective role for interferon-\u2425 (Rubins and Pomeroy, 1997) .",

Hypoglycemia, leucopenia, and decreased plasma mineral concentrations in calves following LPS challenges have been consistently reported (Kinsbergen et al., 1994; Deluyker et al., 2004; Ballou et al., 2008) . The current data suggest that plasma glucose and zinc maybe dose-responsive indicators of acute E. coli septicemia/endotoxemia. The diagnostic value of using either plasma glucose or zinc concentrations to identify a calf that is septicemic versus non-septicemic calf with scours is unknown; future research should determine the sensitivity and specificity of each metabolite to screen severely ill calves for septicemia. It is plausible that non-septicemic calves with scours could also have decreased plasma glucose and/or zinc concentrations due to decreased absorption of nutrients.",

The degree of hypoglycemia and the decrease in plasma zinc observed was directly related to the challenge dose. Calves challenged with the intermediate dose of 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 CFU developed a robust acute phase response with a stronger febrile response and more sustained acute phase protein synthesis. However, the acute phase response of the calves was independent of increases in peripheral concentrations of either the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u2423 or IL-6. All calves developed a febrile response, indicating that rectal temperatures are a sensitive measure of infection, but non-specific for degree of infection. All Jersey calves fed colostrum survived 48 h following the E. coli O111:H8 challenge.",
