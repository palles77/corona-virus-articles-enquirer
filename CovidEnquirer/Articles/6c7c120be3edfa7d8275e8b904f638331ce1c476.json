We report here that two polypeptides with the sizes expected for the 5a and 5b products can be synthesised by in vitro translation of a single artificial mRNA containing both the 5a and 5b ORFs. To establish whether these polypeptides represent genuine virus gene products, both the 5a and 5b coding sequences were expressed as bacterial fusion proteins, and these were used to raise monospecific antisera. Antisera raised against both the 5a and 5b-specific sequences recognized specifically proteins of the expected size in infectious bronchitis virus-infected chicken kidney and Vero cells, indicating that 5a and 5b do represent genuine virus genes, and suggesting that mRNA5 is indeed functionally dicistronic.",

Five such subgenomic mRNAs have been identified in virus-infected cells, and these form a 3' co-terminal 'nested' structure (28, 29) . Recently these mRNAs have been redesignated mRNA 2 to 6 in decreasing order of size (9)) with the genomic mRNA representing mRNA1. For mRNAs 2, 4, and 6, the 5'-\"unique\" region (i.e., the region which is not present in the next smallest mRNA species) contains a single ORF, suggesting that these mRNAs are functionally monocistronic. This is supported by in vitro translation studies which have shown that mRNAs 2,4, and 6 encode the major virion structural proteins spike (S), membrane ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed (M), and nucleocapsid (N), respectively (30). However, the other three mRNAs 1, 3, and 5, all contain more than one ORF in their 5'-\"unique\" region, suggesting that they may be functionally polycistronic. Previous studies in this laboratory have indicated that the two 5' proximal ORFs present on the genomic RNA are expressed in infected cells (6) and can be translated from a single mRNA through an efficient ribosomal frame-shift mechanism (5, 7) . Similarly all three of the ORFs present on mRNA 3 encode proteins in infected cells and can be translated from a single mRNA (20, 26) although by a different mechanism involving independent initiation. As yet however no information is available regarding the coding capacity of mRNA5.",

For this purpose, two plasmids (plBS6 and plBS7) were constructed. Plasmid plBS6 contains the 5b ORF adjacent to the SP6 phage RNA polymerase promoter, and plasmid plBS7 is identical to plBS6 except that it contains both the 5a and 5b ORFs (with 5a adjacent to the SP6 promoter). Details of these plasmid constructions are given in the legend to Fig. la . As shown in Fig. 1 a, plasmids plBS6 and plBS7 may be transcribed in vitro using the SP6 phage RNA polymerase into mRNA containing either both ORFs (plBS7) or 5b alone (plBS6). Transcripts were therefore prepared from Hindlll-digested plBS6 and plBS7, incorporating the dinucleotide 7mGpppG to provide a 5' cap structure ( IO), purified as detailed in Fig. 1 b, and then translated in a cell-free system derived from wheat germ ( 15). The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1 b. Messenger RNA from plBS6 directed the synthesis of a single major translation product, with an apparent molecularweight of about 1 OK, which was consistent with the predicted MW of 9.5K for the product of 5b. Two major products were produced by plBS7-derived transcripts. The larger one comigrated exactly with the 1 OK protein synthesized in response to plBS6-derived RNA, identifying it as the product of 5b. The more abundant product however was not present among those directed by plBS6 transcripts and migrated with the expected molecular weight for 5a (7.5K), strongly suggesting that it does indeed represent the product of the 5a ORF. These data are therefore consistent with the idea that both the 5a and 5b ORFs could encode polypeptides in the virus-infected cells. Furthermore the observation that both 5a and 5b-encoded proteins could be synthesized in vitro in response to a single mRNA (i.e., the plBS7-derived transcripts) raises the possibility that the natural mRNA5 may be functionally dicistronic. To investigate these possibilities further we therefore set out to examine virus-infected cells for the presence of 5a-and Sb-encoded polypeptides.",

Thus both the 5a and 5b ORFs are expressed in infected cells. The function of these polypeptides however remains unclear. The deduced amino acid sequence of 5a is unusual in that 26% (17 out of 65) of its residues are leucines (3), and its obvious hydrophobic nature suggests that it may be membrane-associated, although it does not appear to contain a conventional \"membrane-spanning\" domain.

            "text": "How could these two products be translated from a single messenger RNA? The most obvious possibility is by a \"leaky scanning\" mechanism, in which ribosomes bind at the capped 5' end of the mRNA and scan in a 3' direction until an initiation codon is en-countered; occasionally however they may fail to recognize the initiation codon for the upstream 5a ORF and continue onward to the 5b ORF (17). The sequence context around the initiation codon of the upstream 5a ORF (CGGACGUG) conforms well to that preferred for functional eukaryotic initiation codons ( 16) with an A at the -3 position and G at +4, suggesting that translational initiation of this ORF should occur efficiently. Our in vitro cell free translation results using synthetic mRNAs bearing the 5a and 5b ORFs are consistent with this idea; these mRNAs directed efficient synthesis of a product corresponding to the 5a polypeptide (Fig. 3b) . Expression of the 5b ORF from such synthetic dicistronic mRNAs in vitro was by contrast relatively inefficient, which would be expected if its synthesis relies on leaky scanning ( 17). Furthermore synthesis of both proteins from the dicistronic mRNA was sensitive to inhibition by the cap analogue 7mGTP in vitro (data not shown) suggesting that translation of each required ribosome entry at the 5' end. However 5b synthesis in vitro appeared to be inefficient even when the 5b ORF was placed proximal to the 5'end of a synthetic mRNA (Fig. 1 b) , in spite of the fact that sequences around the 5b initiation codon (GCUGG-C/J&A) would seem to present a favorable context for translation with a G at position -3 and A at +4. It is perhaps surprising therefore that expression of 5b was relatively easy to detect in virus-infected cells in comparison to that of 5a. This could represent a genuine difference in the relative expression ratio of the two proteins in viva from that observed by in vitro translation, as has been reported previously for the products of other di-cistronic mRNAs ( 11, 12, 32) . If this were the case, it would undermine somewhat the argument for leaky scanning as a mechanism to account for 5b translation in vivo. However, the relative ease of 5b detection may simply reflect differing avidities of our mono-specific antisera; indeed, the anti-5b serum clearly recognized its target protein more efficiently than did the anti-5a serum when tested against in vitro translated material (Fig. 2) . At present then the mechanism by which mRNA5 can function dicistronically in infected cells remains unclear, although our in vitro translation data would favor a leaky scanning hypothesis.",

Among the coronaviruses, there are also some examples of functionally polycistronic mRNAs. One of the other IBV subgenomic mRNAs, mRNA3, can function as a tricistronic messenger (20) , encoding a 6.7K proteins (3a), a 7K protein (3b), and a membrane-associated virion protein (3~). Murine hepatitis virus also appears to encode a dicistronic mRNA. Messenger RNA5 contains two ORFs in its 5'-unique region, and a product from the second of these has been detected in virus infected cells (8, 79, 25) .
