            "text": "In the medical literature, motor neuronopathies have rarely been associated with solid tumors. In a recent review, Forsyth et al 2 described 14 patients with motor neuron disease and cancer. These were grouped into patients having anti-Hu antibodies, patients with either a lower motor neuron (LMN) or upper motor neuron (UMN) form, or patients with more typical combined UMN and LMN findings. The authors suggested that patients with either specific paraneoplastic markers (eg, anti-Hu) or with an isolated UMN or LMN syndrome should be investigated for an underlying cancer. In this series, one patient with small cell lung cancer had improvement in muscular weakness with chemotherapy early in his clinical course. Two patients developed respiratory failure late in their disease course requiring mechanical ventilation. No patient presented with respiratory failure or was able to be weaned from mechanical ventilation after therapy for the tumor. 2 To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a paraneoplastic motor neuron disease (MND) presenting with respiratory failure. Furthermore, there was a complete recovery of motor strength and successful weaning from ventilator support following removal of the underlying malignancy. There are case reports of patients with MND having remission of neurologic symptoms after successful removal of their tumor. 3, 4 Renal cell carcinoma in association with MND has been reported, but presenting with more typical peripheral motor weakness. 5 Resolution or improvement of symptoms followed removal of the renal tumor. 3, 5 Such cases are presumably autoantibody related with resolution of antibody production after tumor removal.",

Neurologic investigation and EMG/nerve conduction studies should be sought early in such patients. Infectious bronchitis virus, otherwise known as coronavirus, can cause mild upper respiratory tract illnesses in children and adults. Rarely has coronavirus been linked, either by serology or nasal wash, to pneumonia. We report a case of a young woman who, following treatment for stage IIIA breast cancer using a high-dose chemotherapy regimen followed by autologous bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, developed respiratory failure and was found to have coronavirus pneumonia as diagnosed by electron microscopy from BAL fluid. We propose that coronavirus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory failure in cancer patients who have undergone high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic support.",

Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is the most severe form of posttransplant interstitial pneumonitis and is best characterized by severe hypoxemia, radiographic infiltrates, and is associated with high mortality. 3-5 However, we have recently described in detail a milder form of posttransplant pneumonitis occurring in autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients that we have termed delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome (DPTS). 6 DPTS is characterized by its high incidence (69%), prompt response to steroids with resolution of pulmonary symptoms and improvement in diffusion of carbon monoxide (Dlco), and very low mortality. 6, 7 Radiographic abnormalities, when present, typically appear as scattered, predominantly peripheral ill-defined opacities. 8 Possible mechanisms for the pathogenesis of either IPS or DPTS include the following: (1) pulmonary drug toxic reactions caused by carmustine (BCNU) and/or cyclophosphamide; 3, 9 (2) imbalance of lung cytokines that promote a proinflammatory state; 10, 11 (3) occult latent viral infections (eg, CMV, RSV, Epstein-Barr virus, or human herpes 6 virus); 12, 13 or (4) an imbalance in pulmonary oxidants and antioxidants. 14 Allogeneic transplant patients, in contrast to autologous, are also susceptible to graft-vshost disease processes and in addition, are maintained in an immunodeficiency state for an extended time.",

Phase I is subclinical and asymptomatic and is best characterized by a decreased Dlco measurement following the first three cycles of the CAF induction chemotherapy (Fig 1) .

We believe so. The BAL sample was obtained 36 h after intubation and the bronchoscope was placed into the lumen of the endotracheal tube, thus minimizing possible nasal mucosa contamination. We have considered other possibilities. For example, the coronavirus could simply have been present in the BAL specimen, but was not pathogenic. In this scenario, the etiology of the respiratory failure could have been caused by several different factors, including radiation pneumonitis, druginduced interstitial pneumonitis, or showering of the lung with inflammatory cytokines from an abdominal or septic source resulting in ARDS. Radiation pneumonitis seems less likely since the pattern of radiographic lung injury does not duplicate the radiation port, 6 although case studies have shown that radiation pneumonitis can occur outside the radiation port. 22 It would be unusual to see interstitial pneumonitis from the HDC/ABMT this far out after transplant and without a concomitant decrease in Dlco. 6 The liver biopsy, which occurred 2 days before respiratory failure, was complicated by a stable subcapsular hematoma, a brief episode of hypotension, and fever. We cannot exclude the possibility that inflammatory cytokines, released from GI sources, showered the lung causing acute lung injury leading to respiratory failure. Also, we could not rule out bacterial pneumonia as a complicating factor since the patient was receiving antibiotics for \u03fe24 h prior to obtaining BAL fluid and this would be predicted to lower our diagnostic yield of bacteria.",
