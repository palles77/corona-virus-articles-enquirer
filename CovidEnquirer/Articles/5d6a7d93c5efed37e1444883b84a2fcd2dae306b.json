Of 31 individual elements tested, supplementation with iron alone was sufficient to restore microbial growth in the presence of egg white. Adding to the fortuitous nature of their discovery, the authors posited that an iron-binding component present in the egg white prevented acquisition of this nutrient by microbes, which could have important implications for immunity. Two years later the scientists reported similar activity present in human blood serum [8] . The factor responsible for this activity in both cases was later revealed to be the protein transferrin, which plays a central role in animal iron metabolism by binding and transporting this metal to target cells [9,10].",

Weinberg's theory explained previous observations that human iron overload disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis and thalassemia render affected individuals highly susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. The theory of nutritional immunity was also consistent with George Cartwright's earlier observations that infection induces an acute reduction in circulating iron levels [12] [13] [14] . Subsequent microbiology and molecular genetic studies established that nutritional immunity plays a pivotal role in defense against an array of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites [3, 15] . Owing to the iron-binding properties of proteins, such as transferrin, circulating levels of free iron in the body are orders of magnitude below the requirements for optimal microbial growth.",

One of the most common microbial iron acquisition strategies involves the secretion of siderophores, small molecule chelators, which possess an affinity for iron unmatched even by proteins such as transferrin [17, 18] . Microbes then recover iron-siderophore complexes via cell surface receptors. Obviating the need for siderophores, several microbes also express receptors that directly recognize and extract iron from host proteins including transferrin and lactoferrin [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Additional mechanisms involve the acquisition of heme, the iron-containing porphyrin cofactor, from abundant host proteins such as hemoglobin [24] [25] [26] . Ferric reductases are an important class of iron acquisition systems in fungal pathogens, which convert transferrin or lactoferrin-bound ferric iron into a soluble ferrous form [27] . The identification of iron acquisition genes as pathogen virulence factors further underscores the role of iron in infection, as well as the potential for evolutionary conflicts to arise in the struggle for this precious nutrient.",

Genetic signatures of positive selection at the transferrin-TbpA binding interface suggest that this interaction has been a key determinant of infection during millions of years of primate divergence.

The evolution of lactoferrin introduces a fascinating twist; in addition to sequestering iron, lactoferrin has acquired mutations to generate antimicrobial peptide (AMP) domains that bind and disrupt pathogen membranes [45, 46] .

Some pathogens evade this defense through production of modified 'stealth siderophores', which are not recognized by lipocalin 2 [52,53].

This was an astounding discovery given that iron serves as a cofactor for numerous metalloproteins involved in essential cellular processes including the electron transport chain and DNA metabolism. How then has B. burgdorferi managed such an evolutionary feat? Closer inspection of the B. burgdorferi genome revealed that numerous genes encoding iron-binding proteins have been lost, and remaining enzymes that normally bind iron have undergone modification to bind manganese in its place [54, 55] . Beyond these general observations, we are only beginning to unravel the stepwise genetic mechanisms that lead to such major evolutionary innovations [56-58].

Although the molecular mechanisms by which HFE mutations cause HH are still unclear, HFE is expressed on the surface of several cell types where it interacts with the transferrin receptor Tf-R to regulate iron absorption in the gut and release of iron stored in circulating macrophages. The high frequency of the C282Y mutation among Europeans has led to speculation as to the underlying cause for its abundance [61] . In addition to other associated health problems, individuals with HH are highly susceptible to infection by normally noninvasive microbes, such as the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus and Yersinia enterocolitica [62] [63] [64] . Ironically, this increased susceptibility to extracellular pathogens may be offset by resistance to others that normally infect macrophages such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, which cause tuberculosis and typhoid fever, respectively [65] .

Because na\u00efve populations typically lack pre-existing genetic resistance to these new pathogens, zoonotic diseases have caused some of the most deadly epidemics in human history, including the Black Death and the 1918 Spanish flu, along with recently emerging pathogens such as Ebola virus and the MERS coronavirus [66, 67] . The mechanisms that dictate the host range of pathogens are thus of high interest to evolutionary biologists and infectious disease researchers alike. A number of studies have now implicated nutritional immunity factors in restricting the host range of several bacterial pathogens. For example, bacteria that utilize transferrin receptors possess extremely narrow host ranges, such as the human-specific N. gonorrhoeae and the porcine pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Consistent with this observation, TbpA and its coreceptor TbpB exclusively recognize their host transferrin proteins when compared with diverse mammals [68] [69] [70] . Our recent work further demonstrated that single rapidly evolving sites in transferrin are sufficient to dictate TbpA-binding differences between even our closest relatives, such as chimpanzees [36]. Moreover, expressing or injecting human transferrin in mice can promote infection with human-specific Neisseria [71, 72] . These findings suggest that adaptive evolution of nutritional immunity factors may be sufficient to establish a host range barrier against pathogens. The implications for transferrin variation on host range likely extend beyond bacteria as well, given that transferrin receptors have been implicated in iron acquisition and tropism of Trypanosoma brucei, the eukaryotic parasite that causes African sleeping sickness [73, 74] .",

This hypothesis also invokes the long-standing concept of evolutionary 'cheaters', which can profoundly influence the stability of microbial populations. Previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial siderophore production follows many predictions of kin selection, whereby relatedness and degrees of competition influence the emergence of cheaters that do not produce siderophores [80, 81] .

In addition to previous examples, loss of iron acquisition genes in B. burgdorferi could be interpreted as a Black Queen process arising within the host cell, whereas rapid evolution of bacterial transferrin receptors reflects a prototypical Red Queen conflict. The Black Queen Hypothesis may also provide a basis for understanding the fitness advantage conferred by bacterial receptors such as TbpA. By forgoing siderophore production and targeting host iron-binding proteins directly, these bacteria use a less leaky system, which may be inherently resistant to cheaters. In turn, dependence on these receptors gives rise to Red Queen conflicts with host proteins, such as transferrin, contributing to narrow host ranges observed for these strains. Future studies of iron acquisition could reveal additional genetic or ecological factors that contribute to these distinct evolutionary outcomes and the implications for infectious disease.",

P. aeruginosa, like many microbes, possesses multiple distinct iron acquisition systems, including siderophores and a heme uptake system. Recently Marvig et al. investigated the genetic basis of host adaptation in P. aeruginosa strains that had maintained persistent human colonization for over 36 years [88] . Among several potential adaptations that took place during this period, evidence of positive selection was detected in the promoter of phu, the bacterial heme uptake system. Using experimental culture systems, the authors determined that increased expression of the phu system enhanced bacterial growth in a model of the CF lung, and that similar mutations had occurred independently in P. aeruginosa isolates from other patients with CF. These results suggest that a shift to enhanced heme uptake via hemoglobin plays an important role in the transition of P. aeruginosa from an environmental microbe to a dedicated human pathogen.",

While often present as a commensal member of the gut microbiota, C. albicans is also capable of proliferating in the bloodstream and causing systemic infections in susceptible individuals [89] . The mechanisms by which C. albicans can shift between these distinct lifestyles are still largely mysterious. Chen et al. dissected the evolution of an elaborate transcriptional network in C. albicans whereby incorporation of a novel transcriptional activator, Sef1, into a pre-existing iron-responsive repressor system mediates growth in different host niches [90] . The authors demonstrated that Sef1 promotes iron acquisition and is essential for virulence in vivo. In addition, Sef1 is regulated by and itself regulates Sfu1, a transcriptional repressor. Sfu1 in turn represses iron acquisition and is dispensable for virulence, but is conversely essential for commensal growth in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, C. albicans has evolved an intricate transcriptional program to regulate iron acquisition during commensal or pathogenic states [91] . Given that iron starvation acts as a trigger for activation of virulence genes in many pathogens [92] , it is likely that similar gene regulatory networks also exist in other microbes.",

Adding to this complexity, Neisseria are naturally competent and horizontal gene transfer readily occurs between pathogenic and commensal strains [94] .

For example, while the majority of studies addressing nutritional immunity involve iron, recent work has begun to reveal the contribution of other essential metals including manganese and zinc in this process [95] [96] [97] [98] . In addition, while previous findings have demonstrated that iron plays an important role in microbial competition, we understand comparatively little regarding its importance in the evolution of cooperative microbial communities. Finally, we have focused largely here on the role of bacteria in the evolutionary battle for iron, while fungi and parasites are undoubtedly also subject to similar conflicts [74, 99, 100] . The potential for adaptive evolution to dictate the outcome of microbial infection further provides an impetus to harness these studies for novel therapeutics. The application of evolutionary insights has led to promising genetic and chemical strategies for combatting human disease, most notably in the case of HIV [66, [101] [102] [103] . Future studies promise to reveal additional genetic innovations favoring or countering microbial piracy of iron and other critical nutrients. ",
