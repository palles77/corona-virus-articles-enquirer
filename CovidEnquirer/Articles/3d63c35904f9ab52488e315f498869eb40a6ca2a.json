            "text": "Gastrointestinal viral pathogens have great social and economic impact in both developed and developing nations. Gastrointestinal viruses are shed with human fecal wastes and are transmitted through the oro-fecal route by direct contact with an infected person and by consumption of, or contact with, contaminated water or food (Buesa and Rodr\u00edguez-D\u00edaz, 2006; Knipe and Howley, 2007) . Intestinal viral infections usually result in diarrhea of varying degrees, and oral or parenteral rehydration therapy is the most common treatment. However, there is a growing interest in the use of probiotic antiviral therapies due to their positive influence on human health. Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that, upon ingestion in certain quantities, exert beneficial effects on the host. The most common probiotics are members of the lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, etc.), Bifidobacteria, and some yeast strains. These microorganisms are generally recognized as safe, have a long history of use in food production, and are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract. This ecosystem is colonized by a diverse microbiota, which at some locations can reach up to 10 12 microorganisms per gram of content, and it is constituted by approximately 1000 different species, making it one of the most dense and complex microbial ecosystems. The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the organism's physiology and helps maintain host health (Collado et al., 2009 ). Thus, imbalances in its composition (dysbiosis) underlie some pathologies (e.g., inflammatory bowel diseases). The gut-associated immune system displays a hyporesponsiveness to this resident microbiota, but it is sensitive to products derived from it, the so-called microbial-associated molecular patterns (DNA, components of the cell wall, proteins, etc.), which are sensed by a complex family of receptors present in epithelial and immunocompetent cells (e.g., the Toll-like receptors -TLRs). A cross-talk is established between the microbiota and epithelial/immune cells, which influences cell proliferation and maturation and helps maintain the immune homeostasis and gut barrier functions (Gill and Prasad, 2008) . The epithelium and the intestinal microbiota constitute a synergic physical and chemical defense line against pathogens. These defense functions are susceptible to being modulated by the use of probiotics.",

The major NVs infecting humans belong to the GI and GII genogroups, with the GII4 genotype emerging as the main genotype causing gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. The incubation time ranges from 15 to 48 h, leading to gastroenteritis for 12-60 h from the beginning of the symptoms. NV infection usually courses as a self-limited diarrhea and is characterized by vomiting, but in special cases, it can lead to severe dehydration and death.",

RVs also lead to high childhood mortality in developing countries, causing $500 000 deaths per year as a result of dehydration and deficient medical care. In developed countries, RV diarrheas are responsible for a large number of hospitalizations. Although some RV vaccines have been developed during the last few years, more economic alternatives would be desirable, especially in developing countries. RVs are 70-nm icosahedral viruses that belong to the family Reoviridae and infect mature enterocytes. Seven RV serogroups (A-G) have been described based on the antigenicity of the capsid VP6 protein. Most human pathogens belong to groups A, B, and C. RVs of group A are the most important from a public health standpoint. The virus is composed of three protein shells, an outer capsid, an inner capsid, and an internal core that surround 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. Three major structural and nonstructural proteins are of interest in epidemiological studies and vaccine development against group A RV: NSP4 (genotypes A-F), VP7 (G genotypes 1-15), and VP4 (P genotypes from 1 to 14). VP7 and VP4 are of special interest because they are able to elicit neutralizing antibodies.",

            "text": "One of the first viral infection mechanisms that can be targeted by probiotics is viral binding to host cells. Exclusion of pathogens by direct binding, attachment inhibition, or displacement has been thoroughly studied for bacterial pathogens in in vitro and in vivo studies using probiotics, but data on exclusion of viruses are scarce. Viruses can use oligosaccharides present as glycoconjugates on cellular surfaces as receptors for attachment and entry. RVs recognize sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) residues as a first step for cellular entry, whereas NVs display binding specificities toward a1,2-fucosylated carbohydrates and a2,3-sialylated carbohydrates, which form part of the histoblood group antigens expressed at mucosal surfaces. Many Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains display lectin-like activities on their surfaces. Surface components from these bacteria have been characterized that bind to the highly glycosylated intestinal mucus and extracellular matrix proteins or are responsible for attachment to cultured enterocyte lines (e.g., Caco-2, HT-29, or T84 cell lines) (Lebeer et al., 2008) . The surface layer proteins (SlpA) from Lactobacillus have been implicated in attachment to cellular surfaces and pathogen displacement, and other surface proteins with no evident secretion signals (e.g., chaperones and glycolytic enzymes) decorate the surface of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus reuteri, or Lactobacillus johnsonii strains and behave as sticky factors playing a role in adhesion. Lactobacillus species adapted to the gastrointestinal niche (L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, L. johnsonii, and L. reuteri) possess surfacespecialized proteins involved in mucin binding in a mannose-sensitive manner (lectinlike) or specific mucin-binding pili, as is the case for Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Other molecules of nonprotein nature present at the bacterial surface and reported to be involved in binding are lipoteichoic acids and exopolysaccharides. These types of molecules allow probiotics to attach to the intestinal mucosal surface and might be responsible for their persistence in this niche and, in addition, participate in viral exclusion and displacement from the surface of target cells. Besides, probiotic strains are able to directly bind viruses, which would promote their elimination in feces. This implies that some surface molecules (glycosylated proteins or other components of the cell wall) from probiotics could be mimicking viral receptors. Interestingly, the two strains of L. rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 with a better-documented efficacy in infectious diarrhea exhibited the best binding ability to RV particles (Salminen et al., 2010) .",

Milk fermented with Bifidobacterium bifidum and L. casei DN-114 001 was assayed for its effects in mice and germ-free suckling rats, respectively, demonstrating that survival and colonization of the digestive tract by the probiotics was linked to reduced diarrhea and viral shedding after infection with group A RV (Duffy et al., 1994; Guerin-Danan et al., 2001 ). The murine model has also been utilized to assess the effectiveness of L. rhamnosus GG combined with IgA antibodies against RV. This combination resulted in an effective prophylaxis against RV diarrhea, reducing the virus load in the intestines, preventing histopathological changes, and significantly reducing the diarrhea outcome measures (Pant et al., 2007) .",

B. lactis HN019 reduced the diarrhea associated to RV in a piglet model, showing the potential use of probiotics in farms to reduce the severity of the weanling diarrhea and to improve the feed conversion efficiency associated to a reduction of RV in feces and increased intestinal pathogen-specific antibody titers. This work postulates the enhanced immunemediated response as the possible mechanism for the beneficial effect of this probiotic (Shu et al., 2001) . Following this postulation, studies on the virus-specific B and T cell responses induced by the attenuated and virulent Wa human RV strains in gnotobiotic piglets, with or without L. acidophilus or L. reuteri colonization, demonstrated an enhanced immunity against RV conferred by the probiotics (Zhang et al., 2008a) . These studies were completed by using L. acidophilus and L. reuteri and the virulent human Wa RV strain to assay the distribution and maturation of antigen-presenting cells. The authors showed a differential distribution and frequency of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells. Furthermore, differences in the maturation marker CD14 and a differential activation of TLRs and innate immunity cytokines IFN-g and IL-4 were observed, identifying the enhanced immune response as a possible mechanism of viral protection (Wen et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008b) .",

This study aimed to elucidate the protection ability and seek for a mechanistic explanation of the effect of several probiotics against a model virus (vesicular stomatitis virus or VSV) . When seven different probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium breve DSM 2009, Bifidobacterium longum Q46, Lactobacillus paracasei A14, L. paracasei F19, L. paracasei/rhamnosus Q85, L. plantarum M1.1, and L. reuteri DSM 12246) were analyzed, the protection conferred was up to 70%, and all strains prevented VSV cellular binding when the cell monolayers were preincubated with the strains for 24-48 h prior to the viral challenge. Furthermore, previous adsorption of VSV directly to probiotics had the same effect, giving a mechanistic explanation for the observed protection. Culture supernatants of probiotics were assayed to elucidate if they were able to produce any antiviral metabolite. Three strains, B. longum Q46, L. plantarum M1.1, and L. reuteri DSM 12246, produced metabolites able to reduce the viral infection by up to 67% . Similar results have been obtained with culture supernatants of the L. reuteri strain Probio-16, isolated from pig feces, which blocked viral infection of a group A porcine RV in an African green monkey epithelial cell line (Seo et al., 2010) . Ivec and collaborators showed that four of the strains previously assayed in the Botic's study (L. paracasei/rhamnosus Q85, L. paracasei A14, L. paracasei F19, and B. longum Q46) were able to reduce viral infectivity in macrophages (3D4/21), increasing the antiviral response against VSV measured as IFN-g, IL-6, and nitric oxide production and thus confirming a cross-talk between probiotics and macrophages (Ivec et al., 2007) . The same cell model (IPEC-J12) has been used to study the influence of probiotics on the innate immune response to RV. Two probiotic strains with known anti-rotaviral effect were utilized (L. acidophilus NCFM and L rhamnosus GG), but none of them were able to protect the cell cultures against porcine RV OSU strain infection. L. acidophilus was able to increase the IL-6 response, which was consistent with the adjuvant effect of L. acidophilus. On the contrary, L. rhamnosus GG was able to increase the expression of TLR-2 and decrease the levels of IL-6, confirming an anti-inflammatory effect (Liu et al., 2010) . In this line of experiments, priming of bovine intestinal epithelial cells with L. plantarum 299v prior RV infection resulted in upregulation of genes involved in innate immunity (TLR-3, TLR-7, TLR-9, IFN-a, and IFN-b) and a decrease in virus infection (Thompson et al., 2010) .",

However, it has to be noted that the diverse etiology makes it difficult to assign an episode of infectious diarrhea to a particular pathogen without proper serological, microbiological, or molecular studies. A number of randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that oral intake of certain strains, particularly L. rhamnosus GG and B. lactis Bb-12, promotes a faster recovery from acute RV diarrhea (shortening of diarrhea by 1-1.5 days) and reduced symptom severity (Table 17. 2). Moreover, probiotics are well tolerated and no adverse effects are generally reported. These positive results have also been documented for these and other probiotics in infectious diarrhea of non-RV origin or antibioticassociated diarrhea, supporting the use of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy combined with classical rehydration. However, studies on the prophylactic use of probiotics to reduce the risk of diarrhea in children at day care centers or nosocomial diarrheas originated by RV have produced modest evidences or conflicting results. As an example, studies conducted on 81 hospitalized children orally given two daily doses of 6 \u00c2 10 9 L. rhamnosus GG bacterial cells resulted in an 87% reduction in the incidence of RV diarrhea (Szajewska et al., 2001) . On the contrary, a daily intake of 10 10 bacteria of the same strain in 220 children did not show an effect in the risk of RV diarrhea compared with placebo (Mastretta et al., 2002) .",

Treatment of acute diarrhea in children seems the most justified area of application, although the efficacy of probiotics in gastrointestinal viral infections in adults is still questionable. Research in the field of probiotics and their application needs, however, to address several key issues: (i) The heterogeneity of the experimental designs, the number of patients, the analyses, and the diarrhea outcome measurements, which make evaluation of different clinical trials very difficult. This warrants the design of more standardized trials with higher numbers of subjects in order to obtain better-supported conclusions. This will help to define better treatment protocols with established doses, frequencies, and specific strains. (ii) The research has to be extended to other viruses different from RVs that are important agents causing gastroenteritis, such as NVs. For this, new infection models are needed and an adequate identification of the infectious agent (viral or bacterial nature) in clinical trials is required. (iii) The reported effects are strain specific and proven only for a few probiotics. L. rhamnosus GG, the strain for which a higher number of clinical trials have been conducted, has been shown to be effective against RV but it did not have any effects on enteropathogenic bacteria. On the contrary, other strains have shown effects on diarrheas of viral and nonviral origin. Collections of probiotics need to be screened for their antiviral effects so that specific strains able to inhibit different viruses can be identified. The availability of several in vitro (cell lines) and animal models of infection will help in this screening and in the detailed investigation of the molecular mechanisms and probiotic-derived compounds mediating the effects. Although immunomodulation emerges as the main plausible explanation for the antiviral effects, the underlying mechanisms are far from being understood and constitute an interesting research field for the future.",
