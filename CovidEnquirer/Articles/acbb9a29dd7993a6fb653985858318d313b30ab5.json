Near the end of the response was the statement, \"For a patient with Staphylococcus aureus in the nares, the health care provider or visitor should place a mask on his or her face within 4 feet of the patient.\" 1(p170) The 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) document Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings 2 is cited as the source of the information for the response. However, it is concerning that the information was not applied correctly in response to the droplet precautions question in distinguishing S aureus colonization from active infection.",
