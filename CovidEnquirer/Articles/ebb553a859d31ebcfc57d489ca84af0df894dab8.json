The most diagnostic 40 morphological feature of choanoflagellates, a \"collar complex\" composed of a single apical 41 flagellum surrounded by a collar of actin-filled microvilli (Fig. 1) , was interpreted as evidence of 42 a special relationship between choanoflagellates and sponges, whose choanocytes (or \"collar 43 cells\") each bear a collar complex. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses and the discovery of cells 44 with a collar complex in nearly all animal phyla have revealed that sponges and all other 45 animals are monophyletic, with choanoflagellates as their closest living relatives ( Fig. 1) (Lang 46 et al., 2002; King et al., 2008; Ruiz-Trillo et al., 2008; Burger et al., 2003; Fairclough et al., 2013; 47 We observed that transfected cells resembled untransfected cells in their shape, motility, 133 and ability to propagate, indicating that transfection did not irreparably harm S. rosetta. 134",

Therefore, we investigated the localization of septins, a 193 family of paralogous genes hypothesized to contribute to multicellular development in S. rosetta 194 (Fairclough et al., 2013) . The assembly of septin monomers into higher order structures is 195 important for septin localization and for the conserved roles of septins in 196 regulating cytokinesis and cell polarity in fungi and animals. In animals, septins also function in 197 phagocytosis (Huang et al., 2008) , ciliogenesis (Hu et al., 2010) , and planar cell polarity (Kim et 198 paralogs interact directly through their G-domains to form heteromeric filaments, and these 202 heteromeric filaments interact with each other through the septin coiled-coil domains to form 203 higher order assemblies (Bertin et al., 2008; Garcia et al., 2011; Sirajuddin et al., 2007) . 204 S. rosetta expresses four septin paralogs, three of which have well-annotated genome 205 models in the current draft genome (Fairclough et al., 2013) . We started by examining the 206 localization of the S. rosetta septin protein SrSeptin2 (PTSG_07215), a septin with domains 207 conserved in human and fungal septins (Fairclough et al., 2013) that are necessary for septin 208 filament formation (Sirajuddin et al., 2007; Bertin et al., 2008) .

            "text": "The basal and lateral localization of SrSeptin2 and SrSeptin6 in rosettes is reminiscent of 233 septin localization in polarized epithelial cells (Fares et al., 1995; Spiliotis et al., 2008) , in which 234 septins interact with the positive ends of microtubules that are growing toward the basal pole 235 (Bowen et al., 2011) . In choanoflagellates, microtubules radiate down from the apical 236 microtubule organizing centers (Karpov and Leadbeater, 1998) , with the plus ends meeting at 237 the basal pole of each cell, similar to the orientation of microtubule plus ends toward the basal 238 pole in animal epithelia (Meads and Schroer, 1995) . To examine if septins also interact with the 239 plus ends of microtubules in S. rosetta, we co-transfected cells with mTFP1-SrSeptin2 and the 240 tubulin marker \u03b1-tubulin-mCherry (Fig. 4G ). Fluorescence microscopy showed that septin 241 filaments intercalate between cortical microtubules at the basal pole of the cell ( laboratories. This method overcomes numerous barriers that prevented efficient DNA delivery in 252 our prior attempts using diverse methods, including standard electroporation, lipofection, 253 bombardment, and cell-penetrating peptides. A key breakthrough for this study was the 254 discovery that the extracellular coat surrounding S. rosetta might present a barrier for 255 transfection, which motivated the development of a method to gently remove the extracellular 256 material surrounding S. rosetta, thereby sensitizing cells for transfection. Additional 257 improvements to the transfection procedure, such as a step for promoting the closure of the 258 plasma membrane after electrical pulsation, were designed to address the unique challenges 259 that arise from culturing S. rosetta in sea water. Just as our method was informed by 260 approaches developed in model microeukaryotes (Chlamydomonas and yeast), the methods we 261 have established in S. rosetta will likely extend to aid gene delivery in diverse non-model marine 262",

Lifeact-mCherry also showed details of actin filament 168 organization that have not previously been evident, such as the existence of actin filaments that 169 originate in the cell body and coalesce at the base of the collar to form each microvillus (Fig. 170 3G', upper arrow; improved immunofluorescence techniques also preserve these cortical actin 171 filaments, Fig. 1B).

This mTFP1-SrSeptin2 fusion likely revealed the 211 native localization of SrSeptin2 in S. rosetta because septins visualized by immunofluorescence 212 microscopy in yeast (Ford and Pringle, 1991; Kim, H. B. et al., 1991; Cid et al., 1998; Haarer 213 and Pringle, 1987), Drosophila (Adam et al., 2000; Silverman-Gavrila et al., 2008; Neufeld and 214 Rubin, 1994), and mammalian cells (Spiliotis et al., 2008) display the same localization as 215 septins tagged with fluorescent proteins. 216 To investigate whether SrSeptin2 localized to the basal pole of cells might be part of 217 heteromeric septin filaments, we examined the localization of another septin paralog, SrSeptin6 218 (PTSG_06009) and found that SrSeptin6 displays the same basal localization as SrSeptin2 (Fig. 219 4C). Such colocalization (Fig. S9) and the sequence homology with septins that have previously 220 been shown to form heteromeric filaments (Sirajuddin et al., 2007) strongly suggests that 221 SrSeptin2 and SrSeptin6 assemble together at the basal pole. We further found that the basal 222 localization of SrSeptin2 requires the coiled-coil domain, as a complete deletion of the coiled-223 coil domain (SrSeptin2\u2206CC; Fig. 4A, D, F) eliminated SrSeptin2 enrichment at the basal pole 224 when expressed in wild-type cells. Unexpectedly, mTFP1-SrSeptin2\u2206CC formed ectopic rings 225 around vesicles in the cytosol in wild-type cells (Fig. 4D and 4F). The localization of mTFP1-226 SrSeptin2\u2206CC resembled the formation of ectopic septin filaments at convex membranes and 227 the depletion of septins at the concave membranes in the filamentous fungi Ashbya gosypii 228 (Meseroll et al., 2012) upon the deletion of the coiled-coil domain of the fungal septin Shs1p. 229Similarly, vesicles to which mTFP1-SrSeptin2\u2206CC localized have convex membranes as 230",

From these vectors, we constructed a 269 panel of fluorescently tagged subcellular markers that serve as references for monitoring the 270 localization of other proteins in S. rosetta. For example, through our pilot study of SrSeptin2 and 271 SrSeptin6, the use of these new transgenic tools revealed that septins localize to the basal pole 272 of choanoflagellates, mirroring their localization in animal epithelial cells (Spiliotis et al., 2008; 273 Fares et al., 1995). 274 Observing septin localization in S. rosetta contributes to our understanding of how septin 275 functions evolved prior to the evolution of an epithelium in stem animals. A hallmark of animal 276 epithelia is tightly connected cells that each have an apical and basal pole comprised of distinct 277 lipids, proteins, and cytoskeletal structures (Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014). Septins help 278 shape epithelia and other types of cells by serving as buttresses (Tanaka-Takiguchi et al., 2009; 279 Tooley et al., 2009) and diffusion barriers (Barral et al., 2000; Takizawa et al., 2000; Hu et al., 280 2010) for membranes that have distinct geometries (Bridges et al., 2016; Cannon et al., 2018) 281 and lipid compositions (Casamayor and Snyder, 2003; Tanaka-Takiguchi et al., 2009; Bertin et 282 al., 2010; Bridges et al., 2014) and by interacting with microtubules (Spiliotis, 2010) and 283 filamentous actin (Mavrakis et al., 2014). While comparisons between animals and fungi have 284 revealed conserved functions of septins in cell organization (Spiliotis and Gladfelter, 2012), the 285 divergence of the lineages that gave rise to fungi and animals over one billion years ago 286 (Parfrey et al., 2011) resulted in important differences in fungal and animal cell biology (Stajich 287 et al., 2009). In fungi, septins facilitate polarized cell growth toward the new daughter cell (Kim 288 et al., 1991; Berepiki and Read, 2013), compartmentalize connected daughter cells (Barral et 289 al., 2000; Takizawa et al., 2000; Helfer and Gladfelter, 2006) , and mediate cytokinesis 290",

The basal 294 localization of septins in S. rosetta suggests that septin filaments organize a distinct region at 295 end of the cell, perhaps supporting intercellular contacts at the basal ends of cells in 296 rosettes (Fig. 4E). Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that the Rosetteless 297 protein, which is necessary for rosette development, localizes to the basal end of cells prior to 298 secretion into the interior of rosettes where the basal ends of cells meet (Levin et al., 2014). 299 Continued study of septin function in S. rosetta will establish the mechanisms by which septins 300 facilitate multicellular development, and further comparisons with non-metazoan holozoans with 301 recently established transgenic methods, such as Capsaspora owczarzaki (Parra-Acero et al., 302 2018) and Creolimax fragrantissima (Suga and Ruiz-Trillo, 2013), will provide further insights 303 into the ancestral functions of septins. 304 Previous analyses of gene function in choanoflagellates relied on custom antibodies 305 (Abedin and King, 2008; Young et al., 2011; Burkhardt et al., 2014; Levin et al., 2014), laborious 306 forward genetic screens (Levin et al., 2014), and in vitro biochemistry (Burkhardt et al., 2014). 307",

Complete plasmid 343 sequences and plasmids have also been deposited at Addgene 344 (http://www.addgene.org/Nicole_King). Below is a brief summary of considerations for designing 345 plasmids, and a more detailed description of standard molecular cloning methods for 346 engineering plasmids can be found in the Supplementary Information. 347 Cloning regulatory regions from S. rosetta genes. Because we had no previous 348 knowledge about the architecture of choanoflagellate regulatory regions, we aimed to clone as 349 slightly larger than the mean intergenic distance of 885 bp (Sebe-Pedros et al., 351 2017). Of necessity, the cloned intergenic sequences reported here were shorter to avoid 352 repetitive CA and GT sequences that were present before the putative promoter and after the 353 3'-UTR, respectively. To increase the specificity of primers, we designed the primers to anneal 354 to regions with a GC content \u2264 50%, as the S. rosetta genome is 56% GC. Ultimately, the 355 cloned regions that encompass the promoter and the 5'-UTR ranged in size from 550 bp to 356 1095 bp and those encompassing the 3'UTR ranged from 200 bp to 807 bp. 357 Synthetic gene design. Synthetic reporter genes (nanoluc and the genes encoding 358 diverse fluorescent proteins listed in Supplementary File 1) were codon optimized to match the 359 codon usage of the set of highly expressed intron-less genes listed in Fig. S1, as codon usage 360 can be biased for highly expressed genes (Hiraoka et al., 2009). A codon usage table (Dataset 361 S2) was generated from the coding sequences of highly expressed intronless genes (Dataset 362 S2A) and from all coding sequences (Dataset S2B) using the 'cusp' tool in Emboss (Rice et al., 363 2000). The codon usage table was then used to generate a codon optimized DNA sequence for 364 each target protein sequence with the 'backtranseq' tool on Emboss. The DNA sequences were 365 further edited by making synonymous substitutions with less frequently used codons to change 366 restriction enzyme sites and to remove repetitive sequences. Finally, sequences were added to 367 the ends of these designed genes for cloning with restriction enzymes or Gibson assembly. The 368 engineered reporter gene sequences are available through Addgene (Dataset S1; 369 http://www.addgene.org/Nicole_King). 370 Subcellular marker design. Dataset S3 provides the amino acid sequences for all of the 371 subcellular markers reported in Fig. 3. To ensure that the fluorescent protein tag for each 372 marker would not interfere with the functions of proteins or peptides that determine localization, 373 some of the constructs were engineered to have a flexible linker sequence (SGGSGGS) 374 separating the fluorescent protein and the localization signals. 375 376",

Two days prior to transfection, a culture flask (Corning, Cat. No. 353144) was 381 seeded with S. rosetta at a density of 5,000 cells/ml in 200 ml of 1x High Nutrient Media. The 382 supplemented with 2 mg of frozen E. pacifica by resuspending a 10 mg pellet of 383 flash-frozen E. pacifica in 1 ml of media and then adding 200 \u00b5l of the resuspended pellet to the 384 culture of S. rosetta. 385Wash. After 36-48 hours of growth, bacteria were washed away from S. rosetta cells 386 through three consecutive rounds of centrifugation and resuspension in sterile AK seawater. 387The culture flask was vigorously shaken for 30 sec to homogenize the 200 ml that was seeded 388 two days prior (see above) and then transferred to 50 ml conical tubes and spun for 5 min at 389 2000 x g and 22\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed with a serological pipette, and residual 390 media was removed with a fine tip transfer pipette. The cell pellets were resuspended in a total 391 volume of 100 ml of AK seawater, vigorously shaken in their conical tubes for 30 sec, and then 392 centrifuged for 5 min at 2200 x g and 22\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed as before.Each cell 393 pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of AK seawater, vigorously shaken for 30 sec, and centrifuged 394 for 5 min at 2400 x g and 22\u00b0C. After the supernatant was removed, the cells were resuspended 395 in a total volume of 100 \u00b5l of AK seawater. A 100-fold dilution of cells was counted on a Luna-FL 396 automated cell counter (Logos Biosystems) and the remaining cells were diluted to a final 397 concentration of 5x10 7 choanoflagellate cells/ml. The resuspended cells were divided into 100 \u00b5l 398 aliquots with 5x10 6 cells per aliquot to immediately prime cells in the next step. A 200 ml culture 399 typically yields 6-8 aliquots of cells. 400 Prime. After washing away bacteria, each aliquot of S. rosetta cells was incubated in 401 priming buffer to remove the extracellular material coating the cell. The 100 \u00b5l aliquots that 402 contained 5x10 6 cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 x g and at room temperature. The 403 supernatant was removed with a fine tip micropipette. Cells were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of 404 priming buffer (40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5; 34 mM Lithium Citrate; 50 mM L-Cysteine; 15% 405 (w/v) PEG 8000; and 1 \u00b5M papain) and then incubated for 30 min. Priming was quenched by 406 adding 2 \u00b5l of 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin-fraction V (Sigma) and then centrifuged for 5 min 407 at 1250 x g and 22\u00b0C with the centrifuge brake set to a 'soft' setting. The supernatant was 408 removed with a fine-tip micropipette, and the cells were resuspended in 25 \u00b5l of SF Buffer 409 (Lonza). 410 Nucleofect. Each transfection reaction was prepared by adding 2 \u00b5l of 'primed' cells 411 resuspended in SF buffer to a mixture of 14 \u00b5l of SF Buffer; 2 \u00b5l of 20 \u00b5g/\u00b5l pUC19; 1 \u00b5l of 250 412 mM ATP, pH 7.5; 1 \u00b5l of 100 mg/ml Sodium Heparin; and \u22647 \u00b5l of reporter DNA. (Note that 413 higher volumes of nucleofection lead to lower transfection frequencies; thus, reporter DNA 414 should be as concentrated as possible, not exceeding 7 \u00b5l.

Immediately after pulsation, 100 \u00b5l of ice-cold recovery buffer (10 mM 419 HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5; 0.9 M Sorbitol; 8% (w/v) PEG 8000) was added to the cells, Recovery 420 buffer was gently mixed with the transfected cells by firmly tapping the side of the plate and then 421 incubating the samples for 5 min. The whole volume of the transfection reaction plus the 422 recovery buffer was transferred to 1 ml of 1x High Nutrient Media in a 12-well plate. After the 423 cells recovered for 1 hour, 5 \u00b5l of a 10 mg frozen E. pacifica pellet resuspended in media (see 424 above), was added to each well. The cells were grown for 24 to 48 hours before assaying for 425 luminescence or fluorescence. 426 Note about establishing transfection in non-model microeukaryotes. Establishing a 427 transfection protocol for S. rosetta required adapting several different transfection procedures 428 for a variety of eukaryotic cells to meet the unique requirements of S. rosetta. While the specific 429 details for transfecting S. rosetta may not be readily applicable to other organisms, the general 430 considerations and the process for optimization that led to the development of the transfection 431 protocol described here could inform efforts to transfect other microeukaryotes. Therefore, we 432 have included a summary in the supplementary information (See text and Figs. S10 and S11) of 433 the initial development and optimization of the aforementioned protocol. 434 435 Nanoluc reporter assay 436 To measure relative transfection efficiency resulting from different transfection protocols 437 and promoters, we performed luciferase assays on lysates of transfected cells. Cells transfected 438 with 2.5 \u00b5g of nanoluc reporter plasmids were pelleted by centrifuging for 10 min at 4200 x g 439 and 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of NanoGlo 440 buffer (Promega) and then transferred to a well of a white, opaque 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-441 one Cat No.655083). Luminescence was immediately recorded on a Spectramax L Microplate 442 Reader (Molecular Devices) with a 1 min dark adaption and 10 sec dwell time with the 443 photomultiplier gain set to photon counting mode. 444 Based on standard definitions from analytical chemistry (Harris, 2007) the detection limit 445",

Second, the detection limit was 452 also determined as three standard deviations above the mean of eight replicate luciferase 453 measurements of cells transfected without any reporter plasmid, which resulted in the same 454 calculated detection limit. 455Reproducibility in luciferase assays was assessed by performing at least two independent 456 experiments on separate days with different preparations of 'primed' cells; data presented in 457Fig. 2, S2, S3, S10, and S11 represent one of the independent experiments. Within each 458 experiment from the same preparation of 'primed' cells, replicate measurements were 459 performed by setting up three to five independent transfections for each condition (shown as 460 black dots); bar graphs in Fig. 2, S2, S3, S10, and S11 show the mean values of the five 461 independent transfections with error bars showing the standard deviation. Before performing 462 statistical tests that rely on a normal distribution, luciferase data were transformed to a log-463 normal distribution by taking the base-10 logarithm of luciferase values as gene expression data 464 from luciferase assays display a log-normal distribution (Muranaka et al., 2013). 465 466 Flow Cytometry 467 To measure the percentage of cells expressing each of the different transgenes under 468 different transfection conditions, we used flow cytometry. Cells were transfected with 10 \u00b5g of 469 mWasabi or 10 \u00b5g of TagRFP-T reporter plasmids for flow cytometry because these 470 fluorophores produced the highest fluorescence signal upon illumination with the 488 or 561 nm 471 lasers, respectively. To prepare cells for flow cytometry, cultures from 10-12 transfections were 472 pooled 24 hours after transfection and centrifuged for 15 min at 3600 x g and 4\u00b0C. The 473 supernatant was removed with a fine-tip transfer pipette to avoid disturbing the pellet. The 474 pelleted cells were resuspended in 500 \u00b5l of 0.22 \u00b5m filtered AK seawater and then filtered 475 through a 40 \u00b5m filter. 476 Because a large number of bacteria were present in the cultures, S. rosetta cells were 477 gated based on the area of forward scattering signal versus the area of the side scattering 478 signal and the area of the forward scattering signal versus the height of the forward scattering 479 signals.

To this end, we have established improved protocols for live cell 490 imaging in S. rosetta. Glass-bottomed dishes were prepared for live cell microscopy by corona-491 treating the glass for 10 s. Afterwards, 300 \u00b5l of 0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine was applied to the 492 glass cover (18 \u00b5l/cm 2 ), incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then removed. Excess 493 poly-D-lysine was washed away from the glass surface with three rinses of 500 \u00b5l artificial 494 seawater. 495 Cells transfected with 5 \u00b5g of each fluorescent reporter were prepared for microscopy by 496 centrifuging 1-2 ml of transfected cells for 10 min at 3,600 x g and 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation, the 497 supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 \u00b5l of 4/5 Tropic of Marin 498 artificial seawater with 100 mM LiCl. Lithium chloride slows flagellar beating, as in spermatozoa 499 (Brokaw, 1987; Gibbons and Gibbons, 2013), to decrease the movement of cells during 500 imaging. The resuspended cells were pipetted on top of the poly-D-lysine coated glass-bottom 501 dish and adsorbed on the surface for 10 min. Lastly, 200 \u00b5l of 20% (w/v) Ficoll 400 dissolved in 502 4/5 Tropic of Marin artificial seawater with 100 mM LiCl was pipetted drop-by-drop on top of the 503 cells. The addition of Ficoll decreases flagellar movement by increasing the viscosity of the 504 media (Wilson et al., 2015; Pate and Brokaw, 1980) without significantly changing the 505 osmolarity or refractive index of the sample (GE Lifesciences). 506Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axio Observer LSM 880 with an Airyscan 507 detector and a 63x/NA1.40 Plan-Apochromatic oil immersion objective.

A titration of fluorescent reporter plasmids 527 showed that 10 \u00b5g of total reporter plasmid(s) best balanced transfection efficiency, brightness, 528 and a faithful indication of subcellular architecture. We caution that high plasmid concentrations 529 can result in the overexpression of fluorescent markers, leading to aberrant localization of the 530 marker and gross changes in cell morphology. Such artefacts can be avoided by performing a 531 titration to determine the best concentration of plasmid and recording images from cells with a 532 range of fluorescence intensities that result from any transfection. One of the best markers to 533 assess optimal reporter plasmid concentrations is the tubulin marker because of its distinct 534 localization that can be benchmarked with immunofluorescence. 535 536 Immunofluorescence staining and imaging 537 Immunfluorescence was performed as previously described (Woznica et al., 2016) with 538 modifications to better preserve features of the cytoskeleton.

After allowing the cells to settle 542 on the coverslip for 30 min, 150 \u00b5l of the cell solution was gently removed from the side of the 543 dish.

Introduction to Salpingoeca rosetta, an experimentally-tractable model 895 choanoflagellate 896 (A) S. rosetta and other choanoflagellates (abbreviated as 'choano') are the closest living 897 relatives of animals. (B, C) S. rosetta has a complex life history that includes single cells (B) and 898 multicellular rosettes (C). Immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized S. rosetta single cells (B) 899 highlights the diagnostic cellular architecture of choanoflagellates, including a single apical 900 flagellum (f) made of microtubules (white) surrounded by a collar (co) filled with F-actin (red) of 901 microvilli. Staining for tubulin also illuminates cortical microtubules (cm) that run in parallel 902 tracks along the cell periphery from the apical to the basal poles of each cell. DNA staining 903 (blue) highlights the choanoflagellate nucleus (n) and the nucleoids of bacterial prey (b) present 904 in choanoflagellate cultures. (C) In multicellular rosettes (stained as in panel B), the basal poles 905 of cells are oriented toward the interior of the rosette and the apical flagella point outward. 906 A robust procedure for transfecting S. rosetta 908 (A) A summary of the step-wise procedure to transfect S. rosetta with DNA plasmids. To 909 prepare S. rosetta for transfection, cells were harvested at mid-log phase and then washed to 910 remove bacteria (depicted as grey ovals). S. rosetta cells (depicted with an apical collar, 911 flagellum, and nucleus; n) were primed for nucleofection (step 1) through washing with a buffer 912 that degrades extracellular material. A DNA plasmid encoding a highly sensitive luciferase, 913 nanoluc, or a fluorescent protein was then transfected into the nucleus with a nucleofector (step 914 2). Immediately after transfection, the cells rested in a buffer that promotes membrane closure 915 (step 3). Finally, the cells were transferred into 1x High Nutrient Media prepared with AK 916 seawater for two days (step 4) before we assayed the expression of nanoluc or fluorescent 917 proteins from the transfected DNA. (B) Non-coding DNA sequences flanking the coding 918 sequences for S. rosetta elongation factor L (pEFL), \u03b1-tubulin (pTub), \u03b2-actin (pAct), and 919 histone H3 (pH3) genes drive the expression of a codon-optimized nanoluc reporter gene. 2.5 920 \u00b5g of pEFL-nanoluc, pTub-nanoluc, pAct-nanoluc, and pH3-nanoluc reporter plasmids were 921 each transfected into S. rosetta and the cells were subsequently assayed for luciferase 922 expression. Each reporter produced a luminescence signal that was at least three orders of 923 magnitude greater than the detection limit (dotted line) and significantly greater (one-way 924 statistical tests. (C) Systematically omitting each step of the transfection 927 procedure revealed critical steps for the delivery and expression of plasmid DNA in S. rosetta 928 cells. As a baseline for comparison, cells with 2.5 \u00b5g of pH3-nanoluc reporter (row b) produced 929 a luciferase signal that was three orders of magnitude greater than the background detected 930 from cells transfected without the reporter plasmid (row a). Omitting the priming step by 931 incubating cells in artificial seawater instead of priming buffer (row c), decreased luciferase 932 signal by over two orders of magnitude. Nucleofection without carrier DNA (row d) or the 933 application of the CM156 electrical pulse (row e) resulted in a complete loss of luciferase signal, 934 indicating that both were essential for successful transfection. Directly transferring cells to sea 935 water after nucleofection instead of a buffer that promotes membrane resealing during the rest 936 step (row f) decreased the luciferase signal almost ten-fold. Finally, despite the fact that most 937 prey bacteria were washed out prior to nucleofection, addition of fresh prey bacteria did not 938 appear to be necessary. Supplementing transfected cells with fresh prey bacteria at the start of 939 the recovery step had seemingly little effect on transfection success (row g), probably due to the 940 persistence of a small number of live bacteria throughout the nucleofection procedure. (D and 941 E) Fluorescent reporters mark transfected cells. Live cells transfected with a pAct-mWasabi 942 reporter construct could be observed by fluorescence microscopy (D) and quantified by flow 943 cytometry (E). Untransfected cells were used to draw a gate that includes 99.99% of cells, or 944 four-standard deviations above the mean fluorescence value (left). The same gate was applied 945 to a population of transfected cells (right) to categorize the mWasabi-population. Cells with 946 higher values of green fluorescence that laid outside of the mWasabi-gate are categorized as 947 mWasabi+. The efficiency of transformation, as quantified by three independent flow cytometry 948 experiments, was ~1% in a population of 1 million cells. 949 Fluorescent markers illuminate the cell biology of S. rosetta in live cells 951 Fluorescent subcellular markers expressed from reporter plasmids in live S. rosetta cells were 952constructed by fusing mCherry in frame to genes encoding localization peptides and proteins 953 (Datasets S1 and S3). Twenty-four hours after co-transfecting cells with 5 \u00b5g of a plasmid 954 encoding a subcellular marker fused to the mCherry protein and 5 \u00b5g of a plasmid encoding 955 untagged mTFP1 that served as a whole cell marker, live cells were visualized by 956 superresolution microscopy with a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan.
