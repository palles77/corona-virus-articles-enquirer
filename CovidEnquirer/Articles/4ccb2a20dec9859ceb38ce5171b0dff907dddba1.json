            "text": "We have demonstrated that human peripheral blood basophils released histamine on direct incubation with paramyxoviruses in vitro. Most histamine release occurred during the first I5 to 30 minutes after challenge, depending on the dose of virus used; release initiated by virus was complete by 1 hour. At a viruslcell ratio of 1: 1, Sendai virus caused 41 -C 9% histamine release, whereas parainjluenza type 3 (PI-3) virus caused 25 2 5% release and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus caused 19 -C 5% release. Sendai, but not PI-3 or RS, also caused a decrease in cell number and release of lactic dehydrogenase; however, this apparent cell lysis did not account for all the histamine released. Incubation of cells with virus desensitized them to subsequent triggering by viruses but did not affect response of cells to other stimuli. Histamine release was dependent on the viruslcell ratio, temperature, and metabolic energy, but it was not strictly dependent on the presence of calcium in the extracellular medium. Histamine release was not affected by preincubation of cells with colchicine, suggesting that microtubules were not involved in the release process. Basophils desensitized by anti-IgE in the absence of calcium or treated with lactic acid to dissociate IgE molecules from membrane receptors released amounts of histamine similar to that of control basophils; thus, release was not initiated through Fc, receptors. It was found, however, that histamine release by these viruses was greatly reduced when concanavalin A was used for desensitization. These data demonstrate that the respiratory viruses studied can cause direct nonimmunologic release of histamine from human basophils. Our findings provide evidence for another mechanism by which respiratory viruses can initiate inflammation. (.I ALLERGY CLIN IM.M,NOL 1989; 84:538-46.)

Indeed, we and other investigators have demonstrated histamine in nasal secretions during certain acute respiratory infections.'-Y Welliver et al.' have identified IgE antibociies specific for viral antigens. suggesting that mediator release from respiratory tract mast cells and basophils could be the result of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to viral agents.

These data together imply that concomitant generation of anaphylatoxins from complement by viruses also might initiate mediator release. Sugiyama\" demonstrated that Sendai virus, which is not pathogenic to humans, will induce histamine release in vitro from rat mast cells. However, other investigators have been unak~le to document histamine release from human basophils incubated with viruses that cause human respiratory tract infections. i '-'5 In the present study, we have demonstrated the ability of thre'z paramyxoviruses to cause the direct release of histamine from human basophils. These observations indicate that a direct interaction of paramyxoviruses with mediator-containing cells might be important during respirarory tract infection.",

To begin to understand the potential mechanisms for paramyxovirus-induced histamine release, we explored the time course of release from virus-treated basophils. At a virus/cell ratio of 10: 1, Sendai-induced histamine release was rapid, such that three fourths of release occurred during the first 15 minutes, and the rate of release slowed during the next 45 minutes (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, lower virus/cell ratios caused a decreased rate of release as well as total amount of histamine released. We detected no further release of histamine after the first hour of incubation at any virus/cell ratio tested. Similar results were observed with PI-3 and RS. The changes in rate of histamine release over time suggested that release was the result of degranulation of basophils rather than nonspecific leakage of cell contents or cell lysis.",

To study further this possibility, we used basophils that had been rendered unresponsive to IgE-mediated stimuli with two different approaches. First, basophils were desensitized with either anti-IgE (1 X 10-l mg/ ml) or Con A (5 kg/ ml) for 30 minutes at 37\" C in calcium-free buffer. After cells were washed, they were resuspended in media containing calcium and incubated with a paramyxovirus, anti-IgE, or Con A. As illustrated in Fig.  2 , release induced by anti-IgE or Con A was completely blocked by preincubation with either agent in calcium-free buffer. However, no change in histamine release by these paramyxoviruses was observed when leukocytes had been desensitized with anti-IgE. It also should be noted that preincubation of cells with paramyxoviruses did not affect their subsequent response to triggering with anti-IgE (Table [I) . Second, cell aliquots were suspended in 0.01 mol/L of lactic acid I lactate buffered isotonic saline at pH 3.9 for 2.5 minutes at room temperature to dissociate IgE molecules from basophil membrane receptors. \" After cells were washed in HA buffer, pH 7.4, cells were either maintained in this buffer or passively sensitized with autologous serum and then incubated with anti-IgE or a paramyxovirus. As illustrated in Fig. 3 , lactic acid treatment of cells reduced histamine release by anti-IgE from 51 + 14% (mean :!z SD: n = 3) to Leukocytes were incubated with viruses at a virus/cell ratio of 1: 1, or with anti-IgE antibody (0.1 mg/ml), or calcium ionophore A23187 (0.3 pgiml) at 37\" C in buffer containing 2 mmol/L Ca*+ for 1 hour. After incubation for the first hour, either control media or an additional aliquot of stimulus was added to the incubation mixtures, and the reactions were permitted to proceed for a second hour. Percent histamine released into cell supematants at the end of incubation for the first and second hour are expressed as mean 5 SD of three experiments. *p < 0.05 compared with results of the second hour of incubation with control media. tp < 0.01 compared with results of the second hour of incubation with control media.

However, lactic acid treatment had no effect on histamine release by Sendai, PI-3, or RS. These results demonstrate that triggering of histamine release from human cells is not necessarily IgE dependent. It is noteworthy that there was a decrease in histamine release from basophils that had been desensitized with Con A (Fig. 2) , suggesting that this lectin may be binding to carbohydrates on the cell membrane as well as on IgE molecules. Active release of histamine from mast cells and basophils is dependent on formation of microtubules, transport of intracellular granules containing mediators to the cell surface, fusion of granule membrane with the cell membrane, and subsequent degranulation. Preincubation of basophils with colchicine will block histamine release by IgE-dependent stimuli, by preincubation with anti-IgE (0.1 mg/ml) or Con A (5 wgiml) in HA buffer for 30 minutes at 37\" C followed by washing and further incubation with viruses for 60 minutes in HACM.

            "text": "We also studied the ability of UV inactivated viruses to cause histamine release. Samples of each virus were exposed to UV light; aliquots were removed at intervals and assayed for infectivity, hemagglutinating activity (Sendai only), and ability to cause histamine release (Table IV) . UV treatment of RS for 5 minutes caused a 2.7 log reduction in infective virus while it virtually ablated release of histamine. Similar treatment of PI-3 resulted in a OS log reduction in infective virus while it decreased histamine release by 68%. UV treatment of Sendai caused a 1.6 log reduction in infective virus, but only a single tube dilution decrease in hemagglutination titer; histamine release was decreased by 58%. Thus, we found not only a difference in effect of UV treatment among these viruses but also a discrepancy between effect on infectivity and histamine-releasing capacity. DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that three different paramyxoviruses, Sendai virus, PI-3, and RS, will induce secretion of histamine from preparation of human basophils. The lack of significant LDH release after incubation with PI-3 or RS, the lack of detectable change in cell number, and the inability of additional virus to cause additional histamine release support our conclusion that histamine release is the result of de-granulation rather than leakage or cell lysis. Although Sendai caused some damage to cell membranes, resulting in loss of cytoplasmic content (LDH), this alone was insufficient to explain the histamine release observed, indicating that Sendai also will cause degranulation of human basophils. Our data indicate that IgE molecules and Fc, receptors do not necessarily play any role in histamine release induced by these viruses. Clearly, neither desensitization of cells with anti-IgE nor stripping IgE molecules from Fc, receptors altered virus-induced histamine release, and triggering of cells with virus did not alter their subsequent response to anti-IgE. In fact, the kinetics of release is inconsistent with a receptor-mediated phenomenon. It is evident that triggering cells with either anti-IgE or calcium ionophore A23 187 causes some alteration in cell function that interferes with subsequent triggering by viruses; this is unlikely to be related to Fc, receptors.",

            "text": "Our data suggest that these viruses interact directly with the cell membrane to permit histamine release. It appears reasonable to speculate that this interaction is a result of the binding of virus-specific glycoproteins with carbohydrates on the cell surface, which is the usual mechanism for paramyxovirus attachment that leads to cell infection. These three paramyxovimses all possess F (fusion) glycoproteins that permit insertion of the virus envelope into the cell membrane and, subsequently, also are responsible for formation of syncitia. In the case of human basophils, it is possible that this interaction permits the passive fusion of intracellular granules containing histamine and other mediators with the cell membrane, resulting in release of these mediators extracellularly. It has been suggested previously that this virus-cell interaction results VOLUME 84 NUMBER 4, PART ' in an alteration in the permeability of cell membranes.'O An alteration in membrane permeability permitting influx of calcium would be expected to result in histamine release, and the augmentation of virusinduced histamine release by calcium suggests that this might occur. However, the lack of dependence of virus-induced histamine release on the presence of calcium in the buffer, the lack of inhibition by colchicine, and the kinetics of release all suggest that virus-induced histamine release is not primarily the result of calcium influx and cell triggering, which occurs with the calcium ionophore A23 187. The loss of HA activity by Sendai treated with UV light suggests that this treatment can alter envelope glycoproteins: thi:< effect may explain the loss of histaminereleasing capacity by UV-treated viruses.",

We were unable to detect direct histamine release by viruses other than paramyxoviruses, as in previous studies by other investigators.\"-\" It should be noted that the emphasis of these studies was to demonstrate that viruses affect histamine release by indirect mechanisms. Ida et al.\" were unable to detect histamine release by Sendai, and Chonmaitree et al. I5 were unable to detect histamine release by RS. In both studies, cells were incubated with viruses for 2 hours, washed, then resuspended in virus-free buffer; there was no histamine release from these cells after a subsequent 22-hour incubation. There was no indication of observation for histamine release after the initial 2-hour incubation by either group. We also were unable to dlemonstrate that histamine release occurs after the first 2 hours of exposure to the viruses studied. It is likely that respiratory viruses can trigger mast cells and basophils to release histamine by IgE-dependent mechanisms'; however, these mechanisms are not necessary to achieve significant release of histamine by these viruses. Basophils from all donors studied so far have responded to these respiratory viruses. Small interdonor variability has been noted, which can be observed in the results presented above. We have been unable to identify differences in virus-induced responses of cells from atopic versus nonatopic donors. It should be noted that we did not study cells from children, who might be more susceptible to this effect. Further studies will be necessary to explore the relationship between host susceptibility to this direct virus effect or intrinsic releasability of histamine and clinical symptoms during acute infection with these viruses.",
