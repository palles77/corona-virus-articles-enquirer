Here we present structures of the yeast Chd1 protein engaged with nucleosomes in the presence of the transition state mimic ADP-beryllium fluoride. The path of DNA strands through the ATPase domains indicates the presence of contacts conserved with single strand translocases and additional contacts with both strands that are unique to Snf2 related proteins. The structure provides connectivity between rearrangement of ATPase lobes to a closed, nucleotide bound state and the sensing of linker DNA. Two turns of linker DNA are prised off the surface of the histone octamer as a result of Chd1 binding, and both the histone H3 tail and ubiquitin conjugated to lysine 120 are re-orientated towards the unravelled DNA. This indicates how changes to nucleosome structure can alter the way in which histone epitopes are presented.",

At the heart of all these proteins are paired domains capable of rearranging during the ATP hydrolysis cycle to create a ratchet like motion along DNA in single base increments (Clapier et al., 2017; Gu & Rice, 2010; Velankar et al., 1999) .",

An intriguing aspect of H2BK120ub is that while mutation of the writer enzymes or K120 itself disrupts nucleosome organisation, deletion of the deubiquitinylases increases chromatin organisation (Batta et al., 2011) . One way in which H2BK120 may influence nucleosome organisation is via effects on enzymes responsible for chromatin organisation. Consistent with this H2BK120 increases nucleosome repositioning mediated by Chd1 (Levendosky et al., 2016) .",

The binding of the Chd1 DNABD unravels two turns of DNA from the surface of nucleosomes in a nucleotide stimulated reaction (Farnung et al., 2017; Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) . Here we report a structure for the yeast Chd1 protein in association with a nucleosome, bearing modifications that are found to occur within coding regions, where Chd1 is known to act. Interestingly, nucleosomal epitopes are observed to be reconfigured specifically on the side of the nucleosome on which DNA is unwrapped. This indicates the potential for changes to nucleosome structure to reconfigure the way in which histone epitopes are presented.",

The ATPase domains are bound at the SHL-2 location. Of the two SHL2 locations within nucleosomes, the bound site is in closest proximity to SANT-SLIDE domain bound linker DNA in physical space, but distal on the unwrapped linear DNA sequence (Figure 1 ).

The extent of DNA unwrapping observed here when Chd1 is bound to nucleosomes flanked by a 14 base pair linker DNA is identical to that observed when Chd1 is bound to the opposite surface of the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence with a 63 base pair linker (Farnung et al., 2017) . As the interaction of histones with the two sides of the 601 positioning sequence differ quite dramatically (Chua et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2009; Levendosky et al., 2016; Ngo et al., 2015) , this suggests that the extent of unwrapping is dominated by the properties of Chd1 rather than the affinity of DNA for the octamer. The path of this unwrapped DNA is oriented away from the plane of the wrapped DNA gyre and is kinked at the location where contacts are made with the SANT-SLIDE domains ( Figure 1 ). Other than DNA unwrapping we do not detect additional changes in the organisation of DNA on Chd1 bound nucleosomes at this resolution.",

This is indeed the case as the chromodomains undergo an 18 degree rotation when compared to the orientation observed in The repositioning of ATPase lobe II enables contacts to be made with nucleosomal DNA (see below), the histone H4 tail and the histone H3 alpha 1 helix ( Figure 2 -figure supplement 4) .These are the only direct contacts with histone components of the nucleosome.

With a linker length of 19 bp Chd1 can be modelled binding the linker between adjacent nucleosomes ( Figure 5 ). However, as the linker between nucleosomes is reduced, steric clashes become increasingly prohibitive. The requirement for a 19bp linker is likely to provide a limit below which engagement of the DNABD will be less stable. As this lower limit is set by clashes between the DNABD and the adjacent nucleosome, it is different from the length of linker required to occupy the DNA binding surface of the SANT and SLIDE domains on a mononucleosome with a free DNA linker. In this latter case 7 base pairs of DNA make contact with the DNABD (Figure 1 ). The c19 bp separation below which access of the DNABD to linker becomes progressively more difficult resonates with the average inter-nucleosome spacing of 19 bp observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tsankov et al., 2010) . As the conformation of the DNABD is connected via the chromodomains to the ATPase domains, the structure of Chd1 provides molecular connectivity between the availability of nucleosomal linker DNA in excess of 19bp and the generation of closed nucleotide bound motor domains. This potentially provides a mechanism via which linker DNA length regulates the rate of nucleosome movement (Yang et al., 2006) .",

This has been observed directly for several Snf2 family proteins (Deindl et al., 2013; Lia et al., 2006; Sirinakis et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2006) and is conserved within a wider family of superfamily II ATPases (Singleton et al., 2007) NS3 (Durr et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2017; Thoma et al., 2005) . As a result the alignment is restricted to conserved helices. In the case of lobe I and II the RMSD of the fit is 4.9 \u00c5 and 6.5 \u00c5 respectively (Figure 6 -figure supplement 1A). In the closed state alignment of both domains with the structure of NS3 in the ADP.BeF bound state results in an RMSD of 9.8 \u00c5. Using this alignment the ssDNA bound by NS3 can be docked into the Chd1-Nucleosome structure ( Figure 6A ). This ssDNA aligns with the top strand of nucleosomal DNA ( Figure 6 ).

In addition, the trajectory of the tail is different to that observed in previous structures ( Figure 8A ). This altered trajectory was also not observed in a previous structure of a Chd1 bound nucleosome, however, this structure was made in the presence of PAF1 and FACT which may result in some noise in this region that is not apparent in our structure (Farnung et al., 2017) .

Enzymes that exhibit this organising activity typically reposition nucleosomes away from the ends of short DNA fragments. This is also true for Chd1 (McKnight et al., 2011; Stockdale et al., 2006) . As a result we would anticipate that Chd1 would be most likely to reposition nucleosomes away from the short (exit) linker, encroaching into the long Inferring the mechanism of Chd1 from NS3 is complicated by the fact these enzymes are not so closely related. Conserved motifs are difficult to align based on sequence alone. In addition some aspects of nucleic acid binding by both Snf2 and Chd1 profoundly differ from NS3. Notably, motifs II and III within lobe 1 contact the opposite, 3'-5' stand, which is not present in NS3. In addition, Snf2 related chromatin remodelling enzymes contain features that extend the nucleic acid binding cleft between the two ATPase lobes and make contacts with both strands ( Figure 6 ). As a result of the extensive contacts with both strands, it is possible that the assignment of guide and tracking strands within remodelling ATPases is not absolute as tracking may be coupled to both strands. Consistent with this experiments that have probed the action of remodelling enzymes using short gaps in either strand of nucleosomal DNA have found them to be sensitive to lesions in either strand (Saha et al., 2005; Zofall et al., 2006) .",

All processes that generate local DNA unwrapping would be anticipated to result in similar repositioning of histone tail epitopes. In particular, where combinations of modifications are recognised bivalently, the spatial alignment of epitopes will be important for recognition by coupled reader domains. This potentially provides a means of tuning signalling via histone modifications to regions of transient histone dynamics.",

Conditions were established to favour binding of a single Chd1 to modified nucleosomes that included an asymmetric linker DNA extension of 14bp (Figure 1 -figure supplement 2B) in the presence of ADP-BeF. Purified complexes were frozen onto EM grids. 2D classification of some 893000 particles revealed 16 classes in which nucleosomes with the Chd1 molecule attached could be identified (Figure 1 -Figure supplement 3B). Initial 3D classification resulted in 5 related classes (Figure 1 -Figure supplement 3C). Three of these were combined and reclassified as six classes, one of which was selected for refinement. This resulted in the generation of a map with a resolution of 4.5\u00c5 (FSC 0.143) (Figure 1 -Figure supplement 4A). The resolution varies within the map, with resolution close to 4 \u00c5 in the region occupied by the nucleosome and ATPase lobes and lower resolution in the vicinity of the DNABD and ubiquitin peptides (Figure 1 -figure supplement 4B). The nucleosome particles exhibited a preferred orientation which may limit the resolution (Figure 1 Figure supplement 4C). A structural model was generated to fit the density map making use of the structures of a nucleosome assembled on the 601 DNA sequence, Chd1 chromoATPase, and DNABD (Figure 1).

As a result closure of the ATPase domains is anticipated to drive nucleotide dependent repositioning of the chromodomains. Pulsed EPR was used to directly measure repositioning of the chromodomains in the absence of nucleosomes (Figure 4). The distance between engineered label at V256C in chromodomain I and S524C in ATPase lobe1 is 4.4nm in the open state, consistent with that observed in the crystal structure of the Chd1 chromoATPase domains (Hauk et al., 2010). In the presence of ADP-BeF the 4.4nm distance predominates, but a shoulder is observed consistent with a proportion of molecules adopting a new conformation with a distance of 5.6nm (Figure 4) which is similar to that observed in the ADP-BeF bound nucleosome by cryo-EM.

In addition, DNA is not present in this location as it is lifted off the surface of the octamer (Figure 6 -Figure supplement 2B). In the case of the Snf2 protein the interaction with the adjacent DNA gyre is proposed to anchor the translocase preventing it from transiting around the octamer surface (Liu et al., 2017). Chd1 has a relatively small interaction interface with histones, so there is a similar requirement for DNA interactions to constrain motion of the whole protein. In the case of Chd1 this could instead be provided through the interaction of the chromodomains with DNA at SHL1 and through the interaction of the DNA binding domain with linker DNA. Amino acids 476 to 480 of lobe 1 also interact with DNA in the unravelled state (Figure 6 -figure supplement 2B). These residues are not conserved even in Chd1 proteins so the significance of this contact is not clear. Two molecules of Chd1 can bind a single nucleosome using the same mode of binding.",

Two Chd1 molecules bound in the same mode observed in the 1:1 complex can be docked into this volume. There are no direct contacts between the two Chd1 proteins suggesting that the two bound enzymes are likely to function independently. Previously, negative stain EM of two Chd1 molecules bound to a single nucleosome indicated that the DNA binding domain interacted with linker DNA on only one side of the nucleosome (Nodelman et al., 2017). Our envelope shows that both DNA binding domains can bind to linker DNA simultaneously and that the extent of DNA unwrapping is similar on both sides of the nucleosome. This provides further evidence that the differences in DNA binding to the two sides of the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence do not influence the extent of DNA unwrapping. Any differences between the two bound Chd1 molecules must be localised and not detectable at this resolution.",

On the unwrapped side of the nucleosome, the ubiquitin peptide is displaced across the lateral surface towards the DNA. The unwrapped DNA is oriented away from the lateral surface and this positions the DNA backbone at SHL6 in contact with the repositioned ubiquitin (Figure 8B). In 2D classes, ubiquitin is more prominent on the unwrapped side suggesting it is more tightly constrained. The residues interacting with DNA include Lys 48 Arg 54 and Asp 60. It is likely this interaction stabilises DNA in the unwrapped state, perhaps explaining why H2B K123 ubiquitinylation directly stimulates remodelling by Chd1(Levendosky et al., 2016).",

We show that a second Chd1 molecule can bind the opposite side of the nucleosome using a similar mode of interaction (Figure 7). Even in the case of a nucleosome bound by two Chd1 molecules the lateral surfaces of the nucleosome are accessible for binding by other factors. Despite a lack of direct contacts with histones H2A and H2B, Chd1 activity is dependent on histone dimers (Levendosky et al., 2016). The requirement for histone dimers may arise as a result of dimer loss affecting DNA wrapping.Loss of a histone dimer will result in a loss of histone DNA contacts at SHL3.5, 4.5 and 5.5. More extensive unwrapping of DNA to SHL3.5 would require major repositioning of DNABD in order to retain the interaction with linker DNA while the chromoATPase is engaged at SHL-2. This provides a potential explanation for the dependency of Chd1activity on histone dimers.Conversely, association of a histone dimer with a histone tetramer or hexamer around which DNA is initially significantly unwrapped, could be stabilised by the binding of Chd1 rewrapping DNA to SHL5. The stabilisation of the SHL5 wrapped state may facilitated correct docking of histone dimers into chromatin. This provides a mechanistic basis for the observed activities of Chd1 in H2A/H2B transfer(Lusser et al., 2005)  and chromatin assembly(Fei   et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2012; Torigoe et al., 2013). Repositioning of the Chd1 DNA binding domain towards the major orientation observed in free solution, the Apo state reported by(Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017), would guide linker DNA towards the fully wrapped state. As a result Chd1 has the potential to function in multiple stages of chromatin assembly and the generation of organised chromatin(Lusser et al., 2005; Robinson & Schultz, 2003; Torigoe   et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Stockdale et al., 2006).There is further evidence to support the conformation of Chd1 with the DNABD bound to linker DNA as an active state. Firstly, in the ADP.BeF bound state, the ATPase domains are repositioned to a closed conformation andconserved residues are positioned for catalysis (Figure 2 -figure supplement 3). The closure of the ATPase domains in the Chd1-nucleosome complex is connected to the nucleotide-dependent unwrapping of DNA via repositioning of the chromodomains, which in turn levers the DNABD position. Secondly, efficient nucleosome repositioning by Chd1 is dependent on the DNABD (Ryan et al., 2011b). This is anticipated if the DNA binding domain acts to generate an active conformation, but not if sensing of exit linker DNA is repressive. Thirdly, the activity of chimeric Chd1 proteins in which DNA binding is provided via a heterologous domain is greatest when the cognate binding site is placed in the entry linker mimicking the arrangement observed in the Chd1-nuceosome structure (McKnight et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2012). An additional confounding factor in assigning the directionality with which Chd1 translocates is the recent observation that a single Chd1 molecule can direct bidirectional nucleosome movement (Qiu et al.). As a result, further studies are required to resolve how Chd1 acts to drive DNA across the octamer surface.",

            "text": "possibility that this modification is recognised by the enzyme, possibly via the chromodomains. However, we observe electron density for the histone H3 tail to residue 26, indicating that H3K36 does not stably interact with the chromodomains or any other component of Chd1 in the structure reported here. Furthermore, for this interaction to occur, either the chromodomains would need to be repositioned, or the structure of the Nterminus of H3 reconfigured for example by unfolding of the alpha-N helix (Elsasser et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012). The improved density for the H3 tail on the unwrapped side of the nucleosome is most likely to result from the interaction of the basic N-terminal region of the H3 tail, which is not resolved, with DNA. It is notable that in the fully wrapped state the H3 tail would need to follow a very different path in order to interact with DNA. Consistent with this the trajectory of the H3 tail on the unwrapped side of the nucleosome is different to that observed in structures of intact nucleosomes (Wilson et al., 2016). This raises the possibility that changes to DNA wrapping could affect the way in which histone tail epitopes are displayed. In principle, such effects could be positive or negative. For example the tudor domain of PHF1 preferentially interacts with trimethylated H3K36 on partially unwrapped nucleosomes (Gibson et al., 2017). The interaction of the PHD domains of Chd4 with DNA is also inhibited by nucleosomal DNA (Gatchalian et al., 2017). As a result if Chd4 generates unwrapped structures similar to those observed with Chd1 the interaction of these domains would be enhanced. The reconfiguration of the H3 tail by Chd1 has the potential to affect the interaction of histone reader, writer and eraser enzymes with the tail and as a result the distribution of these modifications in chromatin. Such effects have been observed, as Chd1 contributes to the establishment of boundaries between H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 at most transcribed genes (Lee et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Ubiquitin on the unwrapped side of the nucleosome is repositioned such that it interacts directly with DNA. As in the case of the H3 tail, the repositioning of the ubiquitin resulting from Chd1-directed DNA unwrapping could potentially affect interactions with the factors involved in the placing, removal or recognition of H2BK120ub. The most striking functional evidence for this interplay is that H2BK120ub is greatly reduced in Chd1 mutants(Lee et al.,   2012). One possible explanation for this effect is that Chd1 sequestersubiquitin in a conformation less accessible for removal. Consistent with this the position of ubiquitin on the unwrapped side of Chd1 bound nucleosomes is incompatible with interaction with the SAGA DUB module (Morgan et al., 2016). Interestingly, the paradigm for trans regulation between histone modifications stems from the interplay between H2BK120ub and H3 K4 methylation (Sun & Allis, 2002), both of which are influenced by Chd1 binding. While Chd1 is not required for H3K4me3 (Lee et al., 2012) it does influence the distribution of this histone modification (Lee et al., 2017). H2BK120Ub has previously been observed to directly affect chromosome structure at the level of chromatin fibre formation (Debelouchina et al., 2017; Fierz et al., 2011). Our observations show a new role for H2BK120Ub at the level of nucleosomal DNA wrapping. The specific relocation of ubiquitin on the unravelled side of the nucleosome, the local distortion of H2B at the site of attachment and the presence of lysine and arginine residues at the site of DNA all indicate this is a favourable interaction that stabilises DNA in the unwrapped state. The outer turns of nucleosomal DNA rapidly associate and dissociate on millisecond time scales, with occupancy of the unwrapped state estimated at 10% (Li et al., 2005). The ubiquitin interaction we have observed would be anticipated to stabilise the transiently unwrapped state increasing its abundance. It is however, unlikely that the unwrapped state predominates in the absence of Chd1 or other factors that promote unwrapping as the structure of isolated ubiquitinylated nucleosomes is unchanged (Machida et al., 2016). Nonetheless, increased occupancy of the transiently unwrapped state would be anticipated to facilitate access to nucleosomal DNA. Chromatin folding to form higher order structures is likely to be favoured by fully wrapped, nucleosomes and so an increase in the proportion of unwrapped nucleosomes could potentially contribute to the effects of H2BK120Ub on chromatin fibre formation (Fierz et al., 2011). Many other processes involving chromatin dynamics are linked to H2BK120Ub including transcription (Bonnet et al., 2014), DNA repair (Moyal et al., 2011; Nakamura et al., 2011) and DNA replication (Lin et al., 2014). A more stable unwrapped state could also provide an explanation for the association of factors that lack recognised ubiquitin interaction domains, with ubiquitinylated chromatin (Shema-Yaacoby et al., 2013). Interestingly, H2BK120Ub associating proteins include human Chd1, SWI/SNF complex, pol II and the elongation factors NELF and DISF (Shema-Yaacoby et al., 2013). The change in the position of ubiquitin also has the potential to indirectly affect the way in which other factors interact with ubiquitinylated nucleosomes. On the wrapped side of the nucleosome ubiquitin is positioned such that it occludes access to the acidic patch formed by the cleft between histones H2A and H2B. This provides surface via which many proteins including LANA peptides (Barbera et al., 2006), RCC1 (Makde et al., 2010), Sir3 (Armache et al., 2011), PRC1 (McGinty et al., 2014) and the SAGA DUB module (Morgan et al., 2016) interact with nucleosomes. The repositioning of ubiquitin away from the acidic patch on the unwrapped side of the nucleosome improves access to the acidic patch. In this way H2BK120ub may",
