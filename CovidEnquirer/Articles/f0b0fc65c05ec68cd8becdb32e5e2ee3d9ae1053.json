Nine 4 to 7-day-old calves were randomly assigned to two groups: BoNoV infection (n = 7; calves #1-7) and Mock (n = 2; calves #8 and 9). Calves #1 and 2 were inoculated orally with 11.9 log 10 GE of the CV186-OH strain, while calves #3-7 were inoculated orally with lower doses of the calf #1-passaged intestinal contents as follows: 11.0-11.3 log 10 GE (calves #3-5) and 10.0-10.1 log 10 GE (calves #6 and 7). After BoNoV inoculation, we monitored clinical signs daily until necropsy. Degree of lethargy was evaluated by the magnitude of loss of appetite and activity of calves. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency. Fecal consistency was scored as follows: 0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semi-liquid; 3, liquid, with scores of 1 or more considered diarrheic. Scores 1-3 indicate mild to severe diarrhea, respectively. Calves #3 and 4 were monitored for longer-term clinical signs and virus shedding until PID 30 and PID 21, respectively. Other infected or negative calves were kept for shorter-term studies and were euthanized for histopathological and serological examination at an acute-stage (PIDs 1-3), a mid-stage (PIDs 4-6), and a laterstage (PIDs 8-30) of BoNoV infection. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The Ohio State University approved all protocols related to the animal experiments in this study.

Reverse transcription was conducted at 50 8C for 30 min, followed by a 15 min denaturation step at 95 8C and 45 cycles of 95 8C for 15 s and 60 8C for 1 min using an Eppendorf Realplex thermocycler (Eppendorf, Germany). A standard curve was generated using a plasmid DNA carrying the CBECU F/R amplicon of the Bo/GIII.2/CV186-OH/00/US strain (Smiley et al., 2003) .

For comparison, the VLPs of Hu/GII.4/ HS194/2009/US NoV were also tested in this ELISA (Jung et al., 2012) . The CV186-OH/00/US and Hu/NoV/GII.4/ HS194/2009/US VLPs, semi-purified by ultracentrifugation through a 40% (w/v) sucrose cushion, were used as antigens in a standardized antibody capture ELISA, as validated previously (Thomas et al., 2013) . Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated overnight at 4 8C with 1 mg/ml of either CV186-OH/ 00/US or Hu/NoV/GII.4/HS194/2009/US VLPs or with semipurified Sf9 cell supernatant as negative control in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Blocking was performed with one of the 2 following blocking solutions: i) Blocking solution A, 2% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in 0.01 M PBS-T (pH 7.4), containing 0.05% Tween-20; and ii) Blocking solution B, 1\u00c2 buffered solution of casein (10\u00c2 Power Block TM Universal Blocking Reagent, Biogenx, CA, USA) in distilled water for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Four-fold serial dilutions, beginning at 1:4, of the bovine paired serum samples were added to wells, and the plates were incubated for 1.5 h at Rt. A goat polyclonal antibody to bovine IgG (whole IgG) and conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was diluted (1:1000) in 0.01 M PBS-T (pH 7.4). The plates were incubated for 1.5 h at RT. The assay samples were developed with tetramethylbenzidine (KPL), incubated for 15-20 min at Rt, and stopped with 1.8 N H 2 SO 4. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by using an E max microplate reader (Molecular Devises Co., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Paired positive and negative wells with a resulting difference in absorbance greater than the cut-off value (average value for absorbance of negative control samples plus 3 times the standard deviation) were considered positive for CV186-OH/00/US or HS194/2009/US NoV antibodies. The antibody titers were calculated and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution positive for CV186-OH/00/US or HS194/2009/US NoV IgG antibodies.",

The Gn calves infected with Newbury-1 nebovirus exhibited anorexia and maladsorptive diarrhea, and they also had intestinal lesions, such as atrophic jejunitis, in which IHCpositive cells were identified using convalescent antiserum to detect viral antigens Hall et al., 1984) . Our lab reported that the GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH strain induced diarrhea, fecal virus shedding (RT-PCR), and seroconversion in infected Gn calves (Han et al., 2006 (Han et al., , 2004 , but no histopathology or IHC studies were conducted on the infected calves. A recent study reported prolonged shedding, as determined by qRT-PCR, of conventional calves experimentally infected with a Norwegian GIII.2 BoNoV strain (Jor et al., 2010) . For GIII.1 BoNoV, conventional calves infected with the Jena strain showed early, short-term shedding (RT-PCR and ELISA) ( PID 4) and diarrhea ( PID 3), but they all had severe atrophic enteritis (Otto et al., 2011) . Our study demonstrated that, unlike the Jena GIII.1 BoNoV, the CV186-OH GIII.2 BoNoV did not induce any major histological changes in the intestine of Gn calves, such as necrosis of intestinal epithelium, villous atrophy, or inflammatory lesions. Viral antigens/RNA were not detected in the intestine by IHC/ ISH, indicating difficulties with in situ identification of this virus using routine pathology techniques, and thus requiring improved detection (IHC/ISH) methods with increased sensitivity. Thus, persisting diarrhea exhibited by the infected calves might not be related to virusinduced changes in the intestine as determined by histologic examination, but might be associated with virus-induced immunopathology or possible structural and functional alterations in the intestinal epithelium. Further studies are needed to elucidate the disease mechanisms related to GIII.2 BoNoV infection.",

These two bovine and human NoVs appear to share antigenic epitope(s) in the capsid protein, as suggested in several previous studies (Li et al., 2010; Oliver et al., 2006) . A cross-reactive epitope between GIII.1/GIII.2 BoNoVs and GII.3 HuNoVs was also identified (Oliver et al., 2006) , and an epitope site (N2C3) in the capsid protein of GII.4 HuNoV was reported to be shared with GIII.1/GIII.2 BoNoVs and murine NoVs (GV) (Li et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "In conclusion, CV186-OH GIII.2 BoNoV infection led to persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal shedding, but with no significant intestinal lesions, in infected Gn calves. The enteropathogenic characteristics of the virus differed from the short-term diarrhea and fecal virus shedding that the Jena GIII.1 BoNoV induced in conventional calves, with remarkably severe atrophic jejunitis, suggesting milder enteropathogenicity of the CV186-OH GIII.2 BoNoV. Nevertheless, persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal virus shedding that GIII.2 BoNoV induces, as confirmed in young Gn calves in our study, might contribute to establishment of an endemic situation of enteric disease in young cattle from dairies, feedlots and veal farms. In addition, our data suggest that enteric infection of Gn calves with GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH strain is a useful model for comparative pathogenesis studies of other enteric NoV infections, such as human NoV, due to the pathogenic similarities (prolonged shedding) between GIII.2 BoNoV and human NoVs, as identified in our study. This model might also help to elucidate the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the clearance of NoV from the infected intestine or prolonged virus shedding and diarrhea.",
