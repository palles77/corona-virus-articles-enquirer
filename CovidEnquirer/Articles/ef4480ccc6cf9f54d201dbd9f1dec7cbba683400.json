Inappropriate overemphasis of specialization of disciplines has ignored public health. Identifying the causes of disease and determining how exposures are related to outcomes in ''emerging zoonoses\" affecting multiple species are considered to be the hallmarks of public health research and practice that compels the adoption of ''One Health\". The interactions within and among populations of vertebrates in the causation and transmissions of emerging zoonotic diseases are inherently dynamic, interdependent, and systems based. Disease causality theories have moved from one or several agents causing disease in a single species, to one infectious agent causing disease in multiple species-emerging zoonoses. Identification of the causative pathogen components or structures, elucidating the mechanisms of species specificity, and understanding the natural conditions of emergence would facilitate better derivation of the causal mechanism. Good quality evidence on causation in emerging zoonoses affecting multiple species makes a strong recommendation under the One Health approach for disease prevention and control from diagnostic tests, treatment, antimicrobial resistance, preventive vaccines, and evidence informed health policies. In the tenets of One Health, alliances work best when the legitimate interests of the different partners combine to prevent and control emerging zoonoses.",

It has been continuously proven that inappropriate overemphasis of specialization of disciplines has ignored the large scale approaches to public health; identifying the causes of disease and determining how exposures are related to outcomes in ''emerging zoonoses\"-assumed to be an established understanding of causal mechanisms in ''known zoonoses\"-affecting multi-ple species are considered the hallmarks of public health research and practice.

Beyond the population dynamics, feedback among exposures and outcomes are integral to wider causal webs of the natural environment, and that generates context-dependent effects. Further, causal effects on individual and population levels are impacted by herd immunity and the threshold density of the cause.

Currently, a number of infectious agents-prion disease-are accepted as the cause of disease, despite their not fulfilling all of Koch's postulates. However, severe acquired respiratory syndrome fulfilled the postulates. Bradford Hill's criteria are considered to determine causation. All of Hill's criteria have not stood the test of time. Nevertheless, they are still recognized as the starting point of many new causal explanations for emerging zoonoses. On the contrary, Bradford Hill's criteria cannot be used to dismiss the assumption of a causal relation. The most recent description of Bradford Hill's causality criteria, given by Rothman and Greenland [18] lists the following nine causality criteria which are applied to emerging zoonoses: (1) strength of the association: the stronger the association, the more likely that the association is causal and a weak association would be easier to imagine as an unmeasured confounder. However, a strong association is neither necessary nor sufficient for a cause and a weak association is neither necessary nor sufficient for the absence of causality. (2) Consistency: if more studies find similar results, the more likely it is that the association is causal. Nonetheless, lack of consistency does not rule out a causal association since some effects are produced under unusual circumstances. (3) Specificity: a specific exposure exerts a specific effect. (4) Temporality: the causal exposure should precede the disease in time and this is an inarguable criterion. (5) Biological gradient or dose response: associations of trend with increasing levels of exposure are more likely but not necessarily causal. (6) Plausibility: depends on the current knowledge of the etiology of the disease. The causal inference must be made from not only epidemiology, but also with inputs from toxicology, pharmacology, basic biology, and other sciences. (7) Coherence: refers to other observed biological effects, possibly relevant in the etiologic pathway, that makes a causal association more likely, for instance, histological changes in the target organ. (8) Experimental evidence: to Hill, experimental evidence meant a reduction in the disease rates after the causal agent has been eliminated. (9) Analogy: if a similar agent exerts similar effects, it is more likely that the association is causal.",

There is no single accepted method to establish a causal relationship between an infective agent and its corresponding infectious disease. The two main purposes of epidemiological evidence are to provide a sound understanding on causation and to recommend the basis for intervention. Both of these are dependent on causal status of the observed associations [20] . Currently, we have 70 human vaccines licensed for 30 microbes and this number is expected to rise. Public health authorities traditionally respond to emerging zoonoses by identifying disease in humans and then identifying the cause among animals, or at best, by identifying risk factors related to human infection from animals.",

Analysis of previous emergence events has led to a better understanding of the causes (drivers) of emergence. Predicting pandemics needs a better understanding of the dynamics of pathogen transmission, ecology, and evolution. These advances in causation in One Health can provide valuable insights into pathogen ecology and can inform zoonotic disease-control programs, evidence-based policies and practices. In the tenets of One Health, alliances work best when the legitimate interests of the different partners combine to prevent and control emerging zoonoses.",
