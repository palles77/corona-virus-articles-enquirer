Methods: We conducted a survey of 400 HCWs working in eight hospitals in Beijing by face to face interview using a standardized questionnaire. Results: We found that 280/400 (70.0%) of HCWs were compliant with mask-wearing while in contact with patients. Respiratory infection occurred in 238/400 (59.5%) subjects from November, 2007 through February, 2008. Respiratory infection was higher among females (odds ratio [OR], 2.00 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.16-3.49]) and staff working in larger hospitals (OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.09-2.72]), but was lower among subjects with seasonal influenza vaccination (OR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28-0.76]), wearing medical masks (reference: cotton-yarn; OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.39-0.91]) or with good mask-wearing adherence (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.37-0.98])",

Conclusion: Our data suggest that female HCWs and staffs working in larger hospitals are the focus of prevention and control of respiratory infection in Beijing hospitals. Mask-wearing and seasonal influenza vaccination are protective for respiratory infection in HCWs; the protective efficacy of medical masks is better than that of cotton yarn ones; respiratory infection of HCWs working in low risk areas should also be given attention.",

            "text": "Influenza pandemic has been a global public health issue in recent years, 1 and in 2009, a pandemic of a novel H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin occurred. 2, 3 During the initial stages of an influenza pandemic, supplies of vaccines and antiviral medications are likely to be delayed or inadequate to treat a very large number of affected individuals. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions will be important, including the use of respirators and/or medical masks, which is able to confer respiratory protection. [4] [5] [6] If hospitals are to continue to function adequately during a pandemic, reliable access to effective protection strategies for healthcare workers (HCWs) will be imperative. Reducing transmission to HCWs may not only help support the healthcare workforce, but may also prevent influenza transmission to patients. 7 It is commonly acknowledged that adherence with an intervention can change with perception of risk during a pandemic or an out-break of unknown origin. Since the epidemic of SARS in Beijing in 2003, awareness and commitment to infection control increased, including the use of masks among HCWs. However, we are not aware of the exact rate of and adherence to mask-wearing after the SARS outbreak in 2003. Furthermore, we commonly assume that frontline HCWs are at increased risk of respiratory infection, but to the best of our knowledge there is no data examining this in our setting. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine the level of mask-wearing and respiratory infection in healthcare workers during an influenza season in Beijing, China.",

Eventually, 400 HCWs were enrolled. These 400 HCWs came from a range of different departments and wards representing high and low risk settings for respiratory infection (respiratory, emergency, infectious disease and surgical departments) of eight hospitals in Beijing, using a two-stage random sampling technique. For this study, we classified the first three wards/departments as being high-risk settings for respiratory pathogen transmission and the surgical department as being low risk. In the first stage, eight hospitals were randomly selected from 23 level 2 or 3 hospitals in Beijing. In China, hospitals are categorized into three levels (Level 1, 2 and 3) according to the magnitude (Level 3 > Level 2 > Level 1). 9 In the second stage, for each selected hospital, 50 subjects were randomly enrolled in this survey from respiratory, emergency, infectious disease and surgical departments.",

This high level of mask-wearing adherence may be attributed to enhanced management of nosocomial infection control and improved consciousness among HCWs following the SARS outbreak in Beijing in 2003, especially after the occurrence of SARS infection in HCWs. 11 We found that the majority of our participants used re-usable cotton-yarn masks, followed by medical masks. N95 masks were not reported as being used routinely. It may be hypothesized that the cost of N95 masks may be a potential barrier for their use in these wards, and departments prefer to re-usable cotton-yarn masks which could be considered as more economically viable in the setting of limited funding/resources. *Mask-wearing adherence was categorized into two groups: good adherence (wearing the mask for \u2265 70% of patient-contact time) and poor adherence (wearing the mask for < 70% of patient-contact time). \u2021 Defined as having at least two of the following symptoms simultaneously: fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea. In this study, female and junior/intermediate HCWs had better adherence to mask-wearing than their counterparts, which may be due to better consciousness of self-protection of females and junior/intermediate HCWs who are much more prone to comply with the hospital infection control policies. HCWs of level 3 hospitals had higher level of adherence to mask-wearing, compared to their counterparts in level 2 facilities. This may be due to the stricter and more complete regulations of infection control in larger hospitals.",

[4] [5] [6] 15 The protective efficacy of masks/respirators is provided through a combined effect of transmission blocking potential, the fit and related air leakage of the mask/respirator, and the consistency in the use of masks/ respirators. Their efficacy is graded on the level of protection the material offers, assuming a perfect fit and optimal compliance. 16 Medical masks are designed to protect the environment from respiratory droplets produced by the wearer. Research studies on the filtration and fit of medical masks show wide variation in penetration of aerosol particles (4% to 90%) and a higher amount of face seal leakage when compared to respirators. 17 The fit of cloth masks/cottonyarn masks, which are widely used in Asia, is likely to be even looser than medical masks and hence, cloth masks are likely to have a lower level of protection, suggested by the higher efficacy of medical masks found in this study. In addition, reuse of cloth masks may lead to contamination, which adds to the risk of respiratory infection. But there are no clinical data associated with cloth masks currently.",
