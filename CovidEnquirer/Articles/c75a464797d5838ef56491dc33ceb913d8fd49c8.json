The key intermediate, 4-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid was prepared by the condensation of benzimidazole with aryldiazonium chloride of 4-amino-benzenesulfonic acid, which in turn prepared by the diazotization of 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid [17] . However, based on our experience, the application of the cupric chloride for the condensation of aryldiazonium chloride with benzimidazole as suggested by Dahiya and Pathak [18] resulted in resinous (sticky) products. Therefore, the coupling was carried out by using sodium acetate along with stirring at cold conditions for the initial 3 h followed by 48 h stirring at room temperature which resulted in a solid product. For the synthesis of 4-[1-(substituted aryl/alkyl carbonyl)-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-benzenesulfonic acids, the key intermediates 4-(1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonic acid has been reacted with corresponding aryl/alkyl acid chlorides which were formed by the reaction of corresponding aryl/alkyl acids with thionyl chloride. It is important to note here that the yield of most of the synthesized benzimidazoles were below 50%. The low yield of synthetic compounds may be attributed to any one or more of the following reasons [17] : a). The reaction may be reversible and position of equilibrium is unfavorable to the product; b). The incursion of side reactions leading to the formation of by-products; c). The premature work-up of the reaction before its completion; d). The volatilization of products during reaction or work-up; e). The loss of product due to incomplete extraction, inefficient crystallization or other work-up procedures; f). The presence of contaminants in the reactants or reagents leading to a less efficient reaction. The physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized compounds are presented in Table 1 .",

The primary amino group in compound 1 is depicted by the presence of NH asymmetric stretch at 3481.81 cm \u00c01 . The IR bending vibration corresponding to OCH 3 of compound 8 appeared at 1425.61 cm \u00c01 . The presence of heterocyclic pyridine moiety in compound 15 is demonstrated by the presence of CH out of plane bending at 829.04 cm \u00c01 . The presence of an additional SeN stretch at 808.61 cm \u00c01 apart from the SO 3 asymmetric stretch in the region of 1260e1150 cm \u00c01 indicated that compound 20 contains a link between SO 2 and N 1 of benzimidazole. The appearance of C]O stretch in the range of 1630e1600 cm \u00c01 indicated the formation of tertiary amides (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) by the reaction of acid chlorides with the 4-(1H-benzoimidazol-2yl)-benzenesulfonic acid. Formation of tertiary amide is further evidenced by the absence of IR bands at 1725e1700 cm \u00c01 and 1700e1680 cm \u00c01 corresponding to the alkyl and aryl acids, respectively. The appearance of SO 3 asymmetric stretch in the region of 1260e1150 cm \u00c01 demonstrated the presence of SO 3 H group of benzenesulfonic acid attached to the 2nd position of benzimidazole.",

Further the multiplet corresponds to 6 chloride of methacrylic acid. Further the coupling constant value of 18 Hz in compound 14 indicated that the nature of the double bond in the synthesized compound 14 is of trans nature. Compound 8 showed a singlet at d 3.78 ppm corresponding to a proton of the OCH 3 . This confirmed the attachment of the para methoxy benzoyl group to the N 1 position of benzimidazole. The absence of a singlet at d 11 ppm in the NMR spectra of compounds 1-20 indicated the absence of the free COOH group. This confirms that the compounds 1-20 are tertiary amides and not the physical mixture of aryl/alkyl acids and 4-(1Hbenzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid. Therefore, this assures the reaction of aryl/alkyl acid chlorides with the secondary nitrogen of the benzimidazole nucleus.",

But it is important to note that the predictability of the QSAR models developed in the present study is highly evidenced by the low residual values. This is in accordance with results suggested by Bajaj et al. [30] , who stated that the reliability of the QSAR model lies in its predictive ability even though the activity data are in the narrow range. Further, recent literature reveals that the QSAR have been applied to describe the relationship between narrow range of biological activity and physicochemical properties of the molecules [31e33]. When biological activity data lies in the narrow range, the presence of minimum standard deviation of the biological activity justifies its use in QSAR studies [34, 35] .

The contribution of LUMO in describing antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the interaction of benzimidazole derivatives with nucleophilic amino acid residue like cysteine of microorganisms [42] . The topological descriptor, i.e. the valence second order molecular connectivity index encodes information related to the degree of stargraph likeness and takes a large value for more linear molecule [43] . The trend in Eq. (13) indicated that higher the values of J, LUMO and 2 c v lower will be the antimicrobial activity of benzimidazole derivatives.",

The results of antibacterial activity indicated that compound 9, 4-[1-(4-Nitrobenzoyl)-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-benzenesulfonic acid was effective against all the three bacterial species under test. It may be due to the presence of the electron withdrawing nitro group. The role of electron withdrawing group in increasing the antimicrobial activity is similar to the results of Sharma et al. [44] . 2. The results of antifungal activity indicated that compound 18, 4-(1-octadec-9-enoyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid was effective against both tested fungal strains. 3. The comparison of most effective antibacterial and antifungal compound gave information that the aromatic acid substitution at N 1 of benzimidazole is required for antibacterial activity and aliphatic acid substitution at N 1 of benzimidazole is required for antifungal activity. This indicated that different structural requirements are essential for binding of drug to bacterial or fungal targets respectively [45] . 4. None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. ",

The synthesized compounds were characterized by physicochemical and spectral means and the IR and NMR spectral data are found in agreement with the assigned molecular structures. Further, the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the bacterial strains S. aureus, B. subtilis; E. coli and fungal strains e A. niger and C. albicans by tube dilution method. The antimicrobial screening results indicated that compounds 4-[1-(4-Nitrobenzoyl)-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl]-benzenesulfonic acid (9) and 4-(1-octadec-9-enoyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-benzenesulfonic acid (18) were the most active ones. The antiviral evaluations revealed no specific antiviral activity for the test compounds. The QSAR study carried out to find the relationship between physicochemical parameters and antimicrobial activity of benzimidazole derivatives indicated the importance of the topological parameter, Balaban index (1) 4-Amino-benzenesulfonic acid (0.13 mol) in hydrochloric acid/ water mixture (1:1) was diazotized using solution of sodium nitrite at 0e10 C. To the diazotized mixture, benzimidazole (0.004 mol) was added with vigorous shaking. A solution of sodium acetate (40 g in 100 ml) was added drop wise to the above mixture by maintaining temperature at 5e10 C. The above solution was stirred initially for 3 h at cold condition followed by continuation of stirring at room temperature for 48 h.
