We previously reported the preparation of a feline TNF-alpha (fTNF-alpha)-neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (anti-fTNF-alpha mAb). This anti-fTNF-alpha mAb 2-4 was confirmed to inhibit the following fTNF-alphainduced conditions in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether mAb 2-4 improved the FIP symptoms and survival rate of experimentally FIPV-inoculated SPF cats. Progression to FIP was prevented in 2 out of 3 cats treated with mAb 2-4, whereas all 3 cats developed FIP in the placebo control group. Plasma alpha1-glycoprotein and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were improved by the administration of mAb 2-4, and the peripheral lymphocyte count also recovered. These results strongly suggested that the anti-fTNF-alpha antibody is effective for the treatment of FIP.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. Several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, serosae, kidneys, eyes, and central nervous system, are affected in cats that develop FIP, and the formation of lesions in these organs is accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation (Pedersen, 2009) . Pleural effusion and ascitic fluid was reported to accumulate in some cats. Macrophages/monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP. For example, differences in the proliferation of virus in macrophages/monocytes were shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Stoddart and Scott, 1989) . FECV and FIPV cannot be serologically distinguished from each other; however, FECV infection is normally asymptomatic in cats. It was recently reported that FECV and FIPV may be distinguished based on the base sequences of the ORF 2 (S gene) and 3c genes (Bank-Wolf et al., 2014; Licitra et al., 2013; Pedersen et al., 2012; Porter et al., 2014) .",

For example, when it binds to cell surface TNFR-1, caspase is activated and induces apoptosis, and when it binds to cell surface TNFR-2, transcription factors, such as NF-kB and c-Jun, are activated that promote cell proliferation and induce the expression of cytokines involved in immunity and inflammation (Faustman and Davis, 2010; Tracey et al., 2008) . TNF-alpha plays a critical role in many aspects of immunity. However, the excessive production of TNF-alpha can lead to acute inflammation and immune system abnormalities in human and other animals. The involvement of TNF-alpha in aggravating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease has been reported (Kollias et al., 1999; Brotas et al., 2012; Wang and Fu, 2005) . Moreover, previous studies have described aggravation of the pathologies of viral infections (such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and dengue virus infections) due to increased TNFalpha production (Fauci, 1993; Maury and L\u0103hdevirta, 1990; Poli et al., 1990; Uchide et al., 2012; Yen et al., 2008) .",

The highly pathogenic FIPV 79-1146 was chosen for this reason: the high probability of inducing FIP by the use of FIPV strain 79-1146 may be important to reduce the number of animals used to perform the experiment (to reliably induce FIP). Fewer than 50% of Type I FIPV-inoculated cats develop FIP. In our previous experiment, when the type I FIPV strain KU-2 was orally, subcutaneously, and intraperitoneally administered, the incidences of FIP were 0, 20, and 50% (unpublished data), respectively, suggesting that when type I FIPV is used, the incidence is not stable and the therapeutic effect cannot be accurately judged. It may also be difficult to reproduce FIP development by challenging field fecal materials derived from cats with type I FIP. This point remains to be further investigated.",

Furthermore, clinical signs (fever, listlessness, and jaundice) developed 6-8 days after the FIPV inoculation in all groups. The timing of the administration of mAb 2-4 was based on a comprehensive judgment of these findings. To use a mouse mAb as a placebo, it would be necessary to confirm that it does not affect the virus, feline tissue, or the immune system. Since no such mouse mAb was available, we used the solvent of anti-fTNF-alpha mAb, PBS, as a placebo. Since the single administration of anti-fTNF-alpha mAb caused no adverse reaction to mAbs, we consider that the use of PBS as a placebo was appropriate.",

In addition, a plasma AGP level exceeding the diagnostic criterion of FIP, 1500 \u03bcg/ml (Addie et al., 2009) , was observed on day 21 in the placebo group, whereas the level was significantly lower in mAb 2-4 treated cats.

On the other hand, treatments with anti-inflammatory drugs, represented by steroids, have also been tested because FIP is an inflammatory disease. However, existing anti-FIPV and anti-inflammatory drugs only transiently improve FIP symptoms, and do not improve survival times or quality of life (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008) . MAb 2-4 improved the survival time and quality of life of cats with FIP; however, one of the 3 mAb 2-4-treated cats developed FIP. Thus, further investigations are necessary to determine its applicability as a therapeutic drug for FIP. We considered the combination of the above anti-FIPV drugs and mAb 2-4 to have improved therapeutic effects on FIP. The therapeutic effects of the combination of an anti-TNFalpha antibody and anti-HSV drugs on HSV infection were previously reported to be high (Boivin et al., 2013) . Regarding HSV infection, anti-HSV drugs such as acyclovir that only target the factors essential for viral replication have been developed. This type of drug has recently been developed for FIPV, for which future studies are expected (Hsieh et al., 2010) . The treatment of FIP with a combination of these drugs warrants further investigation.",

However, it may be necessary to investigate the multiple administration of mouse mAb 2-4 to cats in which a therapeutic effect is only temporarily exhibited, as noted in cat No. B3. Since administration of mouse mAb 2-4 leads to anti-mouse mAb response to cats, it may cause anaphylactic reactions as an adverse effect, reductions in the therapeutic effects, and shortening of the half-life from second administration of mouse mAb 2-4. Umehashi et al. (2002) reported that the administration of a mAb with a constant region converted to the feline form (a mousefeline chimeric antibody) did not induce an anaphylactic reaction. Based on this finding, we modified mAb 2-4 to a mouse-feline chimeric antibody, and are now evaluating its effects. Furthermore, we will need to prepare Fab-fragment which removed Fc portion of mAb 2-4.",
