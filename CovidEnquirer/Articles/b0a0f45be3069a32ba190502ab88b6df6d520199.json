Computational binding site discovery focuses on finding significantly overrepresented sequences in upstream regions of co-regulated genes (6) (7) (8) .

Experimental techniques, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (12) , have been successfully used to generate a genome scale mapping of approximate TF-binding positions (10, 13, 14) . Computational techniques, such as phylogenetic profiling (15, 16) and artificial neural networks, can also be used to identify sets of co-regulated genes. Both experimental and computational approaches, however, suffer from a significant false positive (FP) prediction rate. Inclusion of extraneous promoters in the input sets dilutes the enrichment of the shared TFBS sequences making computational TFBS discovery significantly more challenging (17) . We term such erroneously included promoters decoy sequences (DSs).",

The predicted sequences can be used to construct a position weight matrix (PWM) representing the average nucleotide frequencies for each position in the site (19) . Ideally, computational detection will return all sequences that bind to every TF with biologically relevant function in those upstream regions. However, since the source of binding specificity for TFs is not well understood (20) , heuristic approaches and ad hoc multiple alignment based scoring schemes are used to identify locally optimal solutions (17) . Each local optimum that exists in a given set of promoters may correspond to distinctly different motifs, and may score differently relative to each other according to different scoring schemes.",

Mobility shift assays showed several predicted GABR-binding sequences specifically bind nuclear proteins derived from primary neocortical neurons kept in culture.

Sequence similarity based clustering is impaired by the combination of sequence variation within motifs, the short length of TF-binding sites, and aligning motifs of different lengths. Instead of using sequence based clustering, we chose to cluster results by position, counting the number of times Gibbs sampling identifies each nucleotide in the promoter (Figure 1 ). We find that Gibbs sampling predictions, generated using BioProspector (8) are power-law distributed over nucleotide position (Supplementary Figure S2) . Gibbs sampling converges on the majority of nucleotides very infrequently, and a small number of nucleotides very frequently. Thus, the most frequently recurring nucleotides appear in as few as 10% of results. Moreover, we find the power-law distribution of results is robust to Gibbs sampling algorithm and scoring scheme (data not shown). We can hypothesize that the most frequently occurring positions are the most biologically significant. Thus, discarding the least frequent Gibbs sampling results may yield higher accuracy and robust identification of biologically insignificant positions.",

Improvement appears to be limited and unreliable only when sampling alone correctly identifies the binding site in fewer than 20% of results.

            "text": "Identification of GABR cis-regulatory sequences As described above in Introduction, identifying functional TFBS in mammals is difficult due in part to inclusion of decoy sequence from long upstream regions and lack of information on co-regulation of genes. Positional clustering, as shown above, is more robust to noisy input than Gibbs sampling alone, and thus may be better suited to identify de novo cis-regulatory elements in mammalian promoters that are coordinately regulated. To test this possibility, we chose seven mammalian GABR promoters (GABRps) whose activity is potentially altered in response to status epilepticus as identified through change in mRNA levels of the gene products (10) . For each set, the initial promoters were analyzed using Gibbs sampling with positional clustering (solid triangles) and without (open triangles). Two Gibbs sampling approaches were applied to each dataset: a Gibbs sampler procedure similar to BioProspector (8) (row A), and MotifSampler (39) (row B). Row C shows the combination of both sampling procedures, along with positional clustering of the combined results. x-axis counts over addition of DSs. We evaluated the positive predictive value of each technique on each dataset, and found positional clustering generally improved the PPV through addition of 100% random DSs. (31, 35) . We also included orthologous rodent promoters in the input sets (45) . Orthologous promoters were included to provide more instances of binding sites in the input set than would be expected by random, allowing for easier detection of the sites. Inclusion of orthologous promoters has the additional effect of selectively amplifying evolutionarily conserved binding sites. Such binding sites are more likely to have major functional roles in the regulation of the GABR receptor. Thus, sensitivity to such sequences is improved at the expense of sensitivity to species-specific binding sites. With this effect in mind, we require all GABR-binding site predictions to exist in orthologous promoters. Since the mechanisms of co-regulation for the seven GABRs are unknown, hypothetical co-regulation models were evaluated by querying all 2 7 possible subsets of the seven GABRps. Clustering results on nucleotide positions and selecting the most frequently occurring positions, we predicted 13 functional TF-binding sites.",

We began by evaluating the stability of binding site predictions via repeated runs of Gibbs sampling. To quantify the robustness of predictions, we counted the number of Gibbs sampling results at each nucleotide position in the input set ( Figure 1 ) over a large number of repeated trials. We find that the most frequently returned positions better predict TF binding sites than the maximally scoring motifs from Gibbs sampling (Figures 2 and 3 ). Since scoring functions are empirically derived and do not necessarily represent biological reality, the result is not altogether unexpected (17) . However, we find that selecting frequently recurring positions allows filtering of up to 90% of spurious sampling results caused by convergence on biologically uninformative local minima. Positional clustering allows unbiased aggregation of results from different motif widths, thus approximating the width of the binding site 'for free' (54) .",

Such sequences arise from inclusion of promoter regions in input sets without direct binding to the TF either due to experimental error or computational mis-annotation (17, 22) . In the STE12 example studied, linear regression models indicate our approach will maintain an advantage over traditional Gibbs sampling through addition of up to 150% noise to the original signal (Supplementary Figure S4) . Empirical data, however, show a sharp decrease in improvement close to the addition of 45 DSs, or roughly double the input set ( Figure 2 ). Moreover, evaluations using promoters co-regulated by other TFs Figure 6 . Double-stranded oligonucleotide functional assay for GABRA4 regulation. Primary cultures of rat neocortical neurons were treated with DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate) alone (Mock) or with DOTAP and phosphothioate oligonucleotides from either a cAMP response element (CRE Decoy) or a sequence from the GABA-A4 promoter predicted using positional clustering (GABA-A4 Decoy) (GTGCACACACACGCCCACCGCGGCTCGGG). mRNA was harvested after 24 h, and real-time RT-PCR was performed with GABA-A4 specific primers. Error bars refer to individual experiments; i.e. different platings of cells from different animals. Data was normalized to rRNA levels, and expressed as relative mRNA levels (GABA-A4/rRNA).

Neocortical (NEO) and fibroblast (FIB) nuclear extracts from E18 rat embryos were incubated with three 32 P-radiolabeled probes from human A4 and D receptor subunits. Cold wild-type oligonucleotides were used to define specificity through competition. Cold oligonucleotides were added at 100-fold excess over probe. indicate positional clustering is less likely to improve predictions when Gibbs sampling identifies a correct site in <20% of repetitions ( Figure 3 ). Thus, it is possible the rather simplistic linear model overestimates improvement in robustness beyond what is practically achievable. Moreover, when multiple motifs exist in the input promoters, preliminary evidence suggests positional clustering will uniquely identify a single dominant motif (Supplementary Figure S5) . With further refinement, however, it may be possible to recover subordinate motifs, enabling identification of cis-regulatory modules. In spite of these limitations, using positional clustering of repeated runs, researchers can successfully apply sampling algorithms in identification of functional binding sites in datasets with a significant proportion of noise.",

We reasoned that GABA A receptor subunit genes either up-regulated or down-regulated in the animal model of epilepsy would share common binding motifs. Using positional clustering, we predicted 13 TF-binding sites upstream of GABA A receptor subunit genes ( Table 1) . Twelve of our predictions were verified by either comparison to known binding sites or experimental verification using in vitro binding assays.
