            "text": "Originally developed and commercialized as an antiprotozoal agent, nitazoxanide was later identified as a first-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral drug and has been repurposed for the treatment of influenza. A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial recently published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that oral administration of nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for five days reduced the duration of clinical symptoms and reduced viral shedding compared to placebo in persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza. The same study also suggested a potential benefit for subjects with influenza-like illness who did not have influenza or other documented respiratory viral infection. From a chemical perspective, nitazoxanide is the scaffold for a new class of drugs called thiazolides. These small-molecule drugs target host-regulated processes involved in viral replication. Nitazoxanide is orally bioavailable and safe with extensive post-marketing experience involving more than 75 million adults and children. A new dosage formulation of nitazoxanide is presently undergoing global Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of influenza. Nitazoxanide inhibits a broad range of influenza A and B viruses including influenza A(pH1N1) and the avian A(H7N9) as well as viruses that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors. It is synergistic with neuraminidase inhibitors, and combination therapy with oseltamivir is being studied in humans as part of ongoing Phase 3 clinical development. Nitazoxanide also inhibits the replication of a broad range of other RNA and DNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus in cell culture assays. Clinical trials have indicated a potential role for thiazolides in treating rotavirus and norovirus gastroenteritis and chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C. Ongoing and future clinical development is focused on viral respiratory infections, viral gastroenteritis and emerging infections such as dengue fever.",

            "text": "In recent years, the desirability of new broad-spectrum antiviral drugs has been emphasized as a means of providing greater protection against a range of viruses while mitigating risks of resistance and reducing costs associated with developing drugs that are targeted to every specific virus (Shaw, 2011; Diarmond and Farzan, 2013; Debing et al., 2013; Zhou and Simmons, 2012) . In view of the constant threat caused by new emerging strains of influenza and limitations of existing drugs, there is a particular need for drugs with new mechanisms of action that may be used alone or in combination with neuraminidase inhibitors to provide more optimal medical countermeasures against seasonal and pandemic influenza. In this context, the repurposing of nitazoxanide as a treatment of influenza could prove to be important.",

Initially, nitazoxanide was developed as an oral anti-parasitic agent and studied for activity against protozoan and helminthic infections in vitro and/or in vivo in mice, cats, dogs and sheep (Cavier and Rossignol, 1982; Euzeby et al., 1980) . It was first studied in humans for treatment of intestinal cestodes (Rossignol and Maisonneuve, 1984) . Later, nitazoxanide was found effective in cell culture assays and in several animal models against the emerging intracellular protozoan, Cryptosporidium parvum (Blagburn et al., 1998; Theodos et al., 1998; Li et al., 2003; Baishanbo et al., 2006) , and it was licensed in the United States (Alinia \u00d2 , Romark Laboratories) as an Orphan Drug for treatment of diarrhea caused by C. parvum and Giardia intestinalis in adults and children at least 12 months of age (Ortiz et al., 2001; Amadi et al., 2002; Rossignol et al., 2001) . It is the first and remains as the only FDA-approved treatment for Cryptosporidium infection. Nitazoxanide has also been widely commercialized in Latin America and in India where it is indicated for treating a broad spectrum of intestinal parasitic infections.",

            "text": "In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, nitazoxanide has been used primarily for treating intestinal infections. Treating systemic infections in animal models and in humans has been challenging because of the very poor solubility of the drug and its short elimination half-life. Following oral administration, nitazoxanide active pharmaceutical ingredient is absorbed from the intestinal tract and rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma esterases to form tizoxanide, its active circulating metabolite, which then is glucurono-conjugated in the liver. The drug is eliminated in urine and bile as tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide. The half-life of tizoxanide in plasma is only approximately 1.3 h. More than 99.9% of circulating tizoxanide is bound to plasma proteins (Broekhuysen et al., 2000; Romark Laboratories, 2007 In recent years, laboratory studies revealed broad-spectrum antiviral activity of nitazoxanide, rounding out a remarkably broad spectrum of activity for this drug and prompting efforts to develop nitazoxanide and other thiazolides as a new class of antiviral agents. A new controlled-release pharmaceutical formulation of nitazoxanide was developed to deliver drug systemically, and the drug is being repurposed as a new broad-spectrum agent with a novel mechanism of action for treatment of influenza. Here we review the antiviral activity of nitazoxanide and other thiazolides as reported in cell culture assays, animal studies and human clinical trials with an emphasis on influenza.",

The influenza viruses were sensitive to tizoxanide (IC 50 s ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 lg/mL, Table 1 ) using single step virus growth with high multiplicity of infection (5 PFU/cell) and multistep virus growth with low multiplicity of infection (0.001 PFU/cell). Antiviral activity was determined after 24 h in single step assays and after 24, 48 and 72 h for the multi-step assays by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) and/or by hemagglutination assay. The IC 50 s for tizoxanide were similar when influenza A/H1N1/PR8 was cultured in different canine and human cell lines: MDCK cells, monocytic U937, T-lymphocytic Jurkat, and alveolar type II-like A549 (Rossignol et al., 2009a; Ashton et al., 2010; Belardo et al., 2011; Sleeman et al., 2014; Gubareva et al., 2014) . Combinations of nitazoxanide with oseltamivir or zanamivir are synergistic when tested against influenza A/H1N1-PR8 and the avian A/H5N9. Combination index values ranged between 0.39 and 0.63, independent of multiplicity of infection used (Belardo et al., 2011) . As observed for the hepatitis C virus (Korba et al., 2008b) , tizoxanide had a high barrier to resistance to the influenza A virus. No decreased sensitivity was observed when viruses were passaged for 30 days in increasing concentrations (0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 lg/mL) of tizoxanide (Belardo et al., 2011) .",

From a regulatory perspective, placebo-controlled trials are required to clearly demonstrate drug-effect, and because of ethical considerations, placebo-controlled trials cannot be conducted in subjects with complicated illness or those at risk of complications. The trial design was generally consistent with previous clinical trials of oseltamivir and zanamivir, and while it is inherently difficult to compare results of this trial to clinical trials of neuraminidase inhibitors conducted fifteen to twenty years ago, reductions in symptom duration for the 600 mg dose group compared to the placebo (21.2 h) were in the range of those observed during similar trials of the neuraminidase inhibitors. Magnitude of treatment effect observed in different clinical trials could be influenced by study design (e.g., populations selected for analysis, use of acetaminophen or other symptom relief medications) and by characteristics of circulating influenza strains (e.g., pathogenicity, drug susceptibility) during a given trial. For example, this Phase 2b/3 trial enrolled subjects within 48 h of onset of symptoms while studies of the neuraminidase inhibitors typically enrolled subjects within 36 h of symptom onset. In subjects enrolled within 36 h of symptom onset, the median improvement in time to symptom alleviation for the nitazoxanide 600 mg treatment group was extended to 26.3 h.",

The primary efficacy endpoint is time from first dose to alleviation of symptoms, and co-primary efficacy analyses will compare time from first dose to alleviation of symptoms (i) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg group to that of the placebo group and (ii) for the nitazoxanide 600 mg plus oseltamivir 75 mg group to that of each of the other (monotherapy or placebo) groups. This study is being conducted under contract from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services administered by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This study is expected to provide important information related to the clinical benefit of nitazoxanide in treating uncomplicated influenza as well as the potential benefit of combining the drug with oseltamivir. To date, approximately 1600 subjects have been included in the trial over three flu seasons (one Northern Hemisphere and two Southern Hemisphere), and it is expected to be completed during the 2014/2015 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere. Notably, the Phase 3 trial will be the largest clinical trial ever conducted for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza, the first licensure-enabling clinical trial of a combination of drugs for treating influenza, and the first new registration-style clinical trial of oseltamivir that has been conducted in more than ten years. Future clinical trials of nitazoxanide are expected to include patients at risk of influenza complications including those with co-morbidities such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or diabetes, patients over 65 years of age and children under 12 years of age. A clinical trial in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) has recently been initiated under the sponsorship the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02057757).",

Adults and adolescents at least 12 years of age received one 500 mg nitazoxanide tablet or one matching placebo tablet, twice daily for three consecutive days. Children under 12 years of age received a 20 mg/mL suspension or matching placebo administered orally at doses of 200 mg/10 mL (4-11 years of age), 100 mg/5 mL (1-3 years) and 50 mg/2.5 mL (<12 months) twice daily for three days. Nitazoxanide significantly reduced the duration of symptoms compared to placebo in adults and adolescents infected with rotavirus (p = 0.0052) as well as subjects infected with norovirus (p = 0.0295) (Rossignol and El-Gohary, 2006) . Likewise, in children with rotavirus gastroenteritis, treatment with nitazoxanide significantly reduced the duration of symptoms compared to the placebo (p = 0.01) (Rossignol and El-Gohary, 2006) . Another study conducted in 75 children aged from 28 days to 24 months hospitalized with rotavirus gastroenteritis also reported that nitazoxanide significantly reduced the duration of illness (Teran et al., 2009 ). Successful treatment of norovirus gastroenteritis with nitazoxanide was also reported for a 43-year-old patient with leukemia who had received chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Siddiq et al., 2011) .

In this study, 4 of 23 subjects (17%) receiving one nitazoxanide tablet (500 mg) twice daily for 24 weeks experienced a sustained virologic response (SVR) with undetectable HCV RNA in serum six months after the end of treatment (median log 10 reduction = 5.0) compared to none of the 24 subjects (0%) in the placebo treatment group (p = 0.049) .

All four subjects with genotype 1 and 2 experienced SVR . Importantly, nitazoxanide was well tolerated by subjects with chronic hepatitis C enrolled in each of these three Phase 2 studies with no significant additional side-effects or changes in laboratory safety values other than those caused by the combination of peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin carried out monthly during treatment.",

The authors reported that nitazoxanide synergizes with known HIV drugs such as integrase inhibitors, and nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitors, exerting its antiviral effect post-HIV-1 entry, but before or at reverse transcription.",

A study conducted in pediatric patients in Peru has shown that empiric treatment of diarrheal illnesses in children from that region significantly reduced the duration of illness compared to placebo (Rossignol et al., 2012) . The ongoing study in aboriginal children supported by the Australian NHMRC is expected to provide additional data related to its use in treating diarrheal illnesses including viral gastroenteritis. Other similar studies may be expected in view of the growing recognition of the importance of Cryptosporidium as well as rotavirus and norovirus as causes of diarrhea in children. Studies of nitazoxanide for treatment of norovirus in immunocompromised patients have been suggested (Kaufman et al., 2014) and are likely in view of the need for a treatment in this population.",
