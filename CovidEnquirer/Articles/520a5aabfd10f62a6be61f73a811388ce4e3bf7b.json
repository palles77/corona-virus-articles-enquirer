In cell lines, fAPN serves as a receptor for serotype II, but not for serotype I FIPV. The role of fAPN in infection of in vivo target cells, monocytes, is not yet confirmed. Both serotype I and II FIPVs use fDC-SIGN for infection of monocyte-derived cells but how is not known. In this study, the role of fAPN and fDC-SIGN was studied at different stages in FIPV infection of monocytes. First, the effects of blocking the potential receptor(s) were studied for the processes of attachment and infection. Secondly, the level of co-localization of FIPV and the receptors was determined. It was found that FIPV I binding and infection were not affected by blocking fAPN while blocking fDC-SIGN reduced FIPV I binding to 36% and practically completely inhibited infection. Accordingly, 66% of bound FIPV I particles co-localized with fDC-SIGN. Blocking fAPN reduced FIPV II binding by 53% and infection by 80%. Further, 60% of bound FIPV II co-localized with fAPN. fDC-SIGN was not involved in FIPV II binding but infection was reduced with 64% when fDC-SIGN was blocked. In conclusion, FIPV I infection of monocytes depends on fDC-SIGN. Most FIPV I particles already interact with fDC-SIGN at the plasma membrane. For FIPV II, both fAPN and fDC-SIGN are involved in infection with only fAPN playing a receptor role at the plasma membrane.",

Therefore, a lot of research has been focussing on entry processes for a range of viruses (Cooley and Lewin, 2003; Timpe and McKeating, 2008) . This has led to the development of a number of promising agents, for example in the treatment of HIV-1 (Cooley and Lewin, 2003) . Over the last couple of years, the knowledge on the entry of feline coronaviruses in host cells has expanded. After binding to the receptor(s), FIPV 79-1146 is internalized in monocytes through endocytosis, more specifically via a clathrin-and caveolae-independent pathway using dynamin (Van Hamme et al., 2007 . According to , subsequent escape from endosomes is mediated by cathepsin B for FIPV strains 79-1146 and DF2, while for the enteric strain 79-1683 low pH in endocytic compartments and cathepsin L need to assist cathepsin B. In contrast, de Haan et al. (2008) observed that infection with FIPV 79-1146 appears to be insensitive to cathepsin inhibitors.",

            "text": "Two potential receptors have been described for the feline coronaviruses. The first one is aminopeptidase N (APN), also designated CD13, a ubiquitous and multifunctional glycoprotein of approximately 110 kDa and 967 amino acids (Luan and Xu, 2007) . It is a type II metalloprotease that contains seven domains (Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m et al., 2000) . Domains V-VII can interact to form noncovalently linked homodimers (Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m et al., 2000) . Feline APN (fAPN) serves as a receptor for feline, canine, porcine and human coronaviruses in coronavirus subgroup 1 (Tresnan et al., 1996) . However, only serotype II and not serotype I FCoV strains are able to recognize fAPN (Hohdatsu et al., 1998; Dye et al., 2007; Tekes et al., 2010) . Binding of serotype II strains to fAPN from cell lines can be blocked completely by the monoclonal antibody R-G-4 that binds to a region on fAPN between aa 251 and aa 582, i.e., in domains V or VI (Hohdatsu et al., 1998; Tusell et al., 2007) . The interaction between FIPV and fAPN was mainly studied on cell lines and by means of a fAPN cDNA clone originating from the FCWF-4 cell line. Secondly, it has been described that serotype II FCoVs use dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209) for entry into Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells, mouse 3T3 cells transfected with DC-SIGN and monocytes . DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin, which implies that it recognizes its ligands, high-mannose oligosaccharides, through Ca 2+ -dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains (Drickamer, 1999) . Many viruses, such as HIV, Ebola and hepatitis C, use DC-SIGN or the homologue L-SIGN, expressed in liver and lymph nodes, to augment infection (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000; Alvarez et al., 2002; Lozach et al., 2003; P\u00f6hlmann et al., 2003) . Some coronaviruses also interact with these lectins. For SARS-CoV, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN can enhance infection of cells that co-express the major SARS receptor, ACE2 (Jeffers et al., 2004; Marzi et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) . DC-SIGN, but not L-SIGN, can similarly augment infection with human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, that also relies on ACE2 for infectious entry (Hofmann et al., 2006) . Further, L-SIGN expressed in non-susceptible cells can bind HCoV-229E (Jeffers et al., 2006) . For serotype II FCoVs, expression of human DC-SIGN in CrFK cells induced an increase of infection that was blocked by mannan, a competitor of DC-SIGN binding. Further, infection of feline monocytes, the in vivo target cell, was strongly reduced by mannan . Recently, these data were extended and it was shown that both type I and type II FCoVs can use feline DC-SIGN for infection of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Regan et al., 2010) .",

This knowledge is required if we want to target the entry process with antivirals. Therefore, the role of the candidate receptors was determined in the multi-step entry process in blood monocytes. The effects of blocking fAPN and fDC-SIGN were studied for the processes of attachment and infection by FIPV strains Black (serotype I) and 79-1146 (serotype II). In addition, co-localization studies were performed between FIPV and these potential receptors. The aim of this study was to understand how FIPV interacts with its receptors on the primary FIPV target cells in vivo, blood monocytes.",

It is clear that the epitope of APN recognized by R-G-4 is not involved in the interaction between FIPV and DC-SIGN. On the contrary, the reduction of virus binding was slightly smaller compared to the reduction caused by mannan alone. Possibly the presence of the mAbs impair binding of mannan. The co-localization of 65.5 \u00b1 6.8% of bound FIP virions with fDC-SIGN confirms its role in virus binding (Fig. 3) . Further, infection is reduced in mannantreated cells to 1.5 \u00b1 3.7% of infection in control cells. This implies that binding of FIPV I to DC-SIGN results in infection. The reduction of infection is higher than reductions of virus binding, therefore it is possible that DC-SIGN is also involved in processes downstream virus binding.",

This was confirmed by the fact that combining mannan and R-G-4 did not significantly increase the inhibition of attachment caused by R-G-4. The results of the co-localization study between FIPV II and fDC-SIGN on monocytes supported this conclusion as the observed co-localization of 28.9 \u00b1 4.5% did not significantly exceed the level of 'background' co-localization (27.8 \u00b1 5.2%; Fig. 2B ). For infection, unlike for attachment, a reduction to 36.2% of infection in untreated cells was observed when mannan was added. This suggests that fDC-SIGN is involved in infection of primary cells. When both mAb R-G-4 and mannan were added to the cells, infection was reduced significantly to 11.1% of infection in control cells (compared to 19.6% when only APN is blocked). Based on these results, it appears that fDC-SIGN does seem to play a role in the infection process albeit not in initial binding. The underlying mechanism remains elusive thus far.",

Therefore, one might question the specificity of the interaction. To make sure that the effects of mannan are specific, we evaluated the influence of mannan on internalization of cellular components (albumin and transferrin). Mannan did not affect these internalization processes, thus the effect of mannan on entry and infection determined in previous assays is virus-dependent (data not shown). ",

However, probably another receptor besides fDC-SIGN is involved. Further, it cannot be excluded that fAPN interacts inefficiently with FIPV I through an epitope different from the R-G-4-recognized epitope, as suggested by Tekes et al. (2010) . This interaction would not be inhibited by R-G-4 and the co-localization assays only reveal high levels of co-localization ('background' due to co-incidence is 27.8%). In contrast, fDC-SIGN is not a receptor for FIPV II, while fAPN is responsible for the majority of FIPV II binding. However, fAPN is not the only virus binding receptor for FIPV II on monocytes like on CrFK cells. Because blocking fAPN did not completely prevent infection, it remains possible that internalization through the other receptor also leads to infection independently from APN. Although not involved in virus binding, DC-SIGN is important for FIPV II infection, most likely in a step during or after internalization. SARS-CoV infection was also reduced without affecting virus binding by compounds targeting high-mannose oligosaccharides (O'Keefe et al., 2010) . It was suggested that the high-mannose oligosaccharides are important for entry, possibly fusion. Our results suggest a similar role for high-mannoses on FIPV in the entry process through an interaction with DC-SIGN.",

For type II, a strong but incomplete reduction of infection was reported in both monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells.

Accordingly, the effect of blocking DC-SIGN was more pronounced for FIPV I, the strain used at lower moi. Concerning the in vivo relevance of these results, it seems likely that for FIPV I (most prevalent in the field) DC-SIGN will play a role in capturing virus particles in the first stages of infection (low number of virus particles present -comparable to low moi in vitro). Possibly, in the periphery of a pyogranuloma at later stages in infection (high numbers of virus particles present -comparable to high moi in vitro), fDC-SIGN might be less important at the level of virus binding.",
