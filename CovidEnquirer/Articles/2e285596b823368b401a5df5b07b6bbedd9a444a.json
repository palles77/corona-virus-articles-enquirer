(1) describe how confl ict leaves populations in dire poverty, internally displaced or seeking asylum, having poor access to essential services, and consequentially vulnerable to infectious diseases. Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is a disease that seems particularly sensitive to confl ict and deserves more consideration. Major risk factors for cholera-poverty, overcrowding, poor hygiene, contaminated food, and lack of safe drinking water (2,3)-largely resemble the consequences of war and civil fi ghting. Yet little is known about the relationship between cholera and confl ict. This lack of information may be because cholera tends to be epidemic, affecting hundreds to thousands of people across vast, war-torn regions, making it impossible for local governments, nongovernment organizations, and aid workers to control, let alone collect and analyze data.",

They are also among the poorest countries in the world; the latest statistics on human development (5) indicate that compared with all developing countries, on average they have higher rates of undernourishment, refugees, child deaths, and less adequate water and sanitation facilities. Thus, more information is needed about confl ict and cholera, especially in Africa. In Response: We agree with Kelly-Hope on the propensity for cholera outbreaks to occur in confl ict-affected countries and the need to monitor and respond more effectively to such events. In 2006, cholera was reported from 33 countries in Africa, and 88% of all reported cases were from confl ict-affected countries (1) .",
