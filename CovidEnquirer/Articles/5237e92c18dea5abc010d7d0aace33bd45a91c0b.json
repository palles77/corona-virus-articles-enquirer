A test based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) targeting the 5.8S rDNA subunit was designed for the specific identification of T. foetus. The LAMP assay was validated using 28 T. foetus and 35 non-T. foetus trichomonads strains. It did not exhibit cross-reaction with closely related parasites commonly found in smegma cultures like Tetratrichomonas spp. and Pentatrichomonas hominis. Bovine smegma did not show interferences for the detection of the parasite and, the sensitivity of the method (4 \u00d7 10 3 CFU/mL, approximately 10 cells/reaction) was slightly higher than that found for PCR amplification with TFR3 and TFR4 primers. The LAMP approach has potential applications for diagnosis and control of T. foetus and, practical use for low skill operators in rural areas.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technique developed for specific amplification of known DNA sequences (Notomi et al., 2000) . The procedure employs a strand displacement DNA polymerase and 4-6 primers that recognize 6-8 regions on the target DNA respectively, thus providing a high level of specificity (Notomi et al., 2000; Nagamine et al., 2002; Imai et al., 2007) . The LAMP test produces large amounts of DNA under isothermal conditions (60-65 \u2022 C) and it can be performed in a simple water bath. In addition, the high amount of DNA generated makes possible to evaluate the results by the naked eye (Dukes et al., 2006; Hill et al., 2008; Parida et al., 2005; Goto et al., 2009; Iwamoto et al., 2003) . Unlike PCR tests, LAMP has shown high tolerance to biological fluids, implying that DNA purification might be dispensable (Poon et al., 2006; Kaneko et al., 2007) .",

PCR approach based in the amplification of rDNA sequences helps for the rapid discrimination of T. foetus from other trichomonads (Felleisen et al., 1998) .

Thus we were capable to control the presence of specific and non-specific target sequences. Four primers lead to specific amplification of T. foetus DNA in less than 2 h. Faster reactions can be obtained by adding loop primers that would initiate further DNA amplification from the stem-loop region (Nagamine et al., 2002) . Nevertheless, we tested manually designed loop primers, without detecting any improvement in sensitivity or reducing the reaction time of the system. These results might be due to the already stem loop rich structure of ribosomal sequences.

In a complex fluid (smegma), PCR amplification showed a dim band at 4.0 \u00d7 10 3 cell/mL, while LAMP amplification was positive without decreasing the signal strength (Fig. 4) . Such effect is a usual finding in LAMP reactions and might be explained by the high amount of DNA obtained by LAMP reactions, as it was previously reported, where isothermal amplification yielded almost 100 times more DNA than a PCR (Mori et al., 2001) . On the other hand, sensitivity of PCR for T. foetus has been enhanced through enzyme linked assay (Felleisen et al., 1998) , nested-PCR (Gookin et al., 2002; Fernandes et al., 2008) and real time PCR (McMillen and Lew, 2006; Dufernez et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, LAMP for T. foetus detection is a technique conceived to perform DNA amplification with minimal equipment and the high sensitivity achieved (\u224810 parasites/reaction) could be used for direct diagnosis with minimal sample preparation. Up to now, LAMP is rapid, sensitive and specific as most molecular methods and it has found useful applications in diagnosis of virus, several pathogenic microorganisms and few parasites (Mori and Notomi, 2009) .",
