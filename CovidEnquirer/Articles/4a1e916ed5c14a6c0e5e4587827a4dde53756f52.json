Hospital B is a 500-bed tertiary Ministry of Health hospital in Taif Governorate, Makkah Region, Saudi Arabia, and has an associated but physically separate outpatient renal dialysis unit. Serologic analysis was performed on serum samples of PCR-positive MERS patients and of healthcare personnel (HCP) in the dialysis unit of Hospital B. HCP with potential exposure to MERS patients were identified. Enrolled HCP provided written informed consent and completed a brief, standardized questionnaire to gather information about demographics, job duties, symptom information, and specific exposures to MERS-CoV patients during the period of suspected transmission.",

Blood specimens were centrifuged to separate sera, which were transported to the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health and to CDC for antibody and rRT-PCR testing. Demographic and clinical characteristics were reported, and differences were assessed for significance (p = 0.05) by using \u03c7 2 test, Fisher exact test, and t-test, as appropriate. All data were analyzed by using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).",
