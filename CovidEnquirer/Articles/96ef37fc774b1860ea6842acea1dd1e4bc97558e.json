We will begin by discussing one form of acute gastroenteritis which characteristically occurs in epidemics and has been given various discriptive names such as viral diarrhea, epidemic diarrhea and vomiting, winter vomiting disease, epidemic nausea and vomiting, and acute infectious nonbacterial gastroenteritis (6). This is a usually self-limited disease which occurs often in outbreaks and which is characterized by a spectrum of clinical symptoms which may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, malaise, low-grade fever, or a combination thereof. It usually is self-limited with clinical features usually lasting 24-48 hr and appears to have a characteristic seasonal pattern occurring most frequently from September to March (6) .",

In the 1971 study by Dolin et al. (12) , the disease was successfully transmitted to volunteers using material derived from a rectal swab specimen obtained from a secondary case of gastroenteritis which occurred during an outbreak in Norwalk, Ohio (I). A filtrate made from a volunteer's stool specimen produced the disease in addi-tional volunteers, and in addition, filtrates derived from stools from the second volunteer passage again successfully induced the characteristic disease in volunteers (6, 12, 13) . However, in spite of the availability of known infectious stool filtrates and recent advances in cell and organ culture technology, an etiologic agent could not be isolated from any of these filtrates in cell cultures, and such attempts in intestinal organ cultures were inconclusive (6, 12, 13) .",

The difference in the quantity of antibody coating the particles in the prechallenge and postchallenge sera is clearly evident. After: Kapikian, A. Z., Feinstone, S. M., Purcell, R. H., Wyatt, R. G., Thornhill, T. S., Kalica, A. R., and Chanock, R. M., in \"Perspectives in Virology,\" Vol. IX (in press). other findings as well, suggested that the 27-nm particle was the etiologic agent of Norwalk gastroenteritis (18) . Additional studies by Thornhill et al. (24) in our laboratory, in which the technique of IEM was used to determine the shedding patterns of the Norwalk particle have provided additional evidence to support this view. In these studies, a total of 77 stool filtrates were examined by IEM using a serum which contained a high level of antibody; the particle was visualized in stool filtrates derived from stools of 11 of 23 volunteers who developed illness after challenge with Norwalk outbreak-derived stool filtrates. It was striking that the Norwalk particle was not observed in any of the 12 specimens obtained prior to the onset of illness, in 26 of 54 obtained during the first 72 hr after the onset of illness, and in only two of 11 obtained after 72 hr following the onset of illness. It was also found that the maximal shedding of the particle quantitatively occurred at the onset of experimental illness and shortly thereafter. We also found that a 1:5 dilution of an aliquot from a preparation of commercial immune serum globulin contained antibody to the Norwalk particle indicating that antibody to this or a related agent must occur more than rarely in the general population (17) . It appears, however, from crosschallenge studies by Wyatt et al. (25) in our laboratory and from our IEM studies (17, 18) that there are other gastroenteritis-producing viral agents which may represent additional serotypes not related antigenically to the Norwalk agent. It is noteworthy that the Norwalk agent appears to be parvovirus-like on the basis of its morphology, ether, acid, and relative heat stability, and buoyant density in cesium chloride (13, 20) . We expanded our gastroenteritis studies to include infants and young children admitted to Children's Hospital of the District of Columbia with acute gastroenteritis in an attempt to determine the etiologic agents of this severe disease in this young age group (21) . Previous studies from Australia, England, and Canada have suggested that an orbivirus-or reovirus-like agent might be an important etiologic agent of this disease (3) (4) (5) 7, 14) . We examined stool filtrates prepared from stools obtained during January, February, and March of 1974 from 21 infants and children 2 to 20 mo of age who had acute gastroenteritis manifested by diarrhea with or without vomiting, by IEM and in some instances conventional EM as well. These children all had gastroenteritis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. We found characteristic reovirus-like particles in stool filtrates prepared from stools from I3 (62%) of the 21 patients (21) . These particles had such a distinct morphological appearance and in general were so numerous in this study, that when stool filtrates were examined for the presence of reovirus-like particles by both conventional and IEM, they were positive by both methods. They measured approximately 70 nm in diameter and resembled the reoviruses morphologically (Fig. 3) . We were able to demonstrate serologic evidence of infection by IEM, and in addition were able to develop a complement-fixation test using a stool filtrate as antigen and by this test system demonstrated serologic evidence of infection also (21) .",

In a recent study by Wyatt et al. from our laboratory, the reovirus-like agent has been propagated in human fetal intestinal organ cultures, and in addition a serologic test has been developed utilizing indirect immunofluorescence (26). Another major step in the further study of these gastroenteritis agents will be attained when they are successfully propagated in a readily available cell culture system so that widespread epidemiologic studies can be carried out in order to elucidate their relative importance as agents of viral gastroenteritis. Until this is done, studies with available techniques should continue to yield valuable information. Luncet 2,",
