            "text": "Certain future scenarios of technological change are dystopian in their predictions. Fewer are optimistic. Taking a pragmatic stance, this paper seeks to identify certain key threats associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies, giving voice to those in the literature on different sides of the debate. Novel literature is considered that suggests that innovations in the discovery, or research process itself, may hold the key to developing certain collaborative capabilities that can amplify collective intelligence. These capabilities are discussed together with their potential to meet the challenges associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies. Testable propositions are derived from literature, and four technological scenarios are developed for analysis. Certain key challenges are identified and discussed in relation to each of the technological scenarios. In doing so, what are hopefully useful insights are derived for how changes can be made in the present to help avoid meeting the fates described by certain of these scenarios. T threats. These threats are used to guide and anchor discussions and arguments throughout different sections of the paper. This paper therefore seeks to make a contribution to the future studies literature, in the following ways. First, it seeks to relate the threat of technological development to Sardar's (2010) four laws of future studies. Whereas most approaches to such problems suffer from the constraints associated with disciplinary lenses, this work seeks to understand these problems through a systematic approach that does not privilege any specific disciplinary approach over another. Future studies \"is not just multi-and trans-disciplinary, it is unashamedly un-disciplinary: that is, it consciously rejects the status and state of a discipline while being a fully fledged systematic mode of critical enquiry\" (Sardar, 2010:183). This is Sardar's first law, and it is particularly important in light of certain of the arguments made here, which draw on Nielsen's (2012) theory of networked science, and its predictions that human collaboration enabled by novel technologies can result in radical innovations in the scientific discovery process itself. Nielsen argues that it is changes in the scientific discovery process itself that account for the great scientific leaps, or scientific advances through history. It is argued here that Nielsen's theory offers useful insights into how radical innovations in the research, or R&D process itself can improve the capacity of humans to manage technological advancement, or other 'wicked problems' associated with technological proliferation, considered here in terms of six primary technological threats facing humankind.",

            "text": "Second, although seemingly alarmist, the potential threats of technological proliferation require consideration for those seeking to develop useful future scenarios for how technology may impact society going forward. Technological advancement has seemingly considerable potential for technological development and proliferation to contribute to the betterment of society through elevating the health and wellbeing of populations (and through offering outright solutions to catastrophic problems). However, it also has the potential for catastrophic consequences of technological development itself and the proliferation of harmful outcomes. Effective theory needs to be developed that can help stakeholders capture benefits while mitigating risk. This paper therefore poses an important question, namely what are the key theoretical dimensions of this problem? This problem is defined as the need to manage the seemingly unlimited opportunities of technological change while at the same time also managing the proliferation of dangerous technological applications.",

It is also argued that a focus on the management of these two aspects, or dimensions, can provide important guidelines for the development of a discovery system that is relatively more robust to threats posed by both innovation failure as well as from dangerous technology proliferation.",

            "text": "These two dimensions relate to the urgent need (i) to manage the openness of the discovery system itself, and (ii) to manage the power relationships associated with a rapidly developing system of technological innovation. Sardar's (2010:183) second law states that future studies are characterized by Mutually Assured Diversity (MAD), whereby MAD \"is the proposition that full preservation of our humanity requires that [human diversity] is assured, that it not only survives but thrives in any desired future, and that future generations mutually recognise and appreciate each others' diversity.\" It is argued here that key to the survival of humans in the face of technological proliferation, following Nielsen's (2012) theory, is the need for openness in the discovery process itself, whereby openness is a necessary condition for the knowledge creation necessary for the co-evolution of our capabilities to manage the accelerating rate of emergent technologies. Indeed, according to Tegmark (2017:89), the challenges of technological advancement \"transcend all traditional boundaries-both between specialties and between nations.\" Sardar's (2010:183) third law relates to how futures studies are sceptical, and \"the reality of things is inaccessible to the human mind and certitude is impossible to attain.\" Given the uncertainties associated with technological proliferation, in developing theoretical insights it is necessary to take recourse to theory that predicts how diversity in human action has seemingly been checked by power throughout human history (see Foucault, 1982) . Thus, to develop a theoretical frame that is sceptical of truth claims, the initial structure developed here focuses first on a key defining issue of the knowledge age, namely the radical changes in the discovery process on account of the democratisation of knowledge (Callaghan, 2016) . These changes seem to be fundamentally enabled by the increasing openness of the knowledge creation process itself. Second, the analysis focuses on the way that power relationships have seemed to pose a fundamental threat to the diversity of views in human history (Foucault, 1982) . In this way, analysis is related to primary technological threats.",

To do so, a choice must be made in terms of what scientific methodology to use, and a definition is required, as to what it means to 'address' such threats. Given the almost unimaginable uncertainties associated with technological advancement and its consequences (Vinge, 1993; Szerszynski, Kearnes, Macnaghten, Owen, & Stilgoe, 2013; Bostrom, 2017; Tegmark, 2017) , and therefore the need for responsible innovation (Grunwald, 2011; , this paper takes recourse to the approach of future studies to develop a theoretical framework relating to how to prepare for such scenarios. In doing so, this paper also seeks to advance the argument that only through improvements in the capacity of humans to manage technology, can human agency survive into a technological future. This argument therefore draws from Tegmark's (2017) logic, that given uncertainty about technological outcomes, an important goal is to immediately undertake technology-safety research, and make this research mainstream. As an organising framework, literature is used to derive six primary technological [O]ptimists predict a \"science fiction,\" utopian future with Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics (GNR) revolutionizing everything, allowing humans to harness the speed, memory capacities and knowledge sharing ability of computers and our brain being directly connected to the cloud. Genetics would enable changing our genes to avoid disease and slow down, or even reverse aging, thus extending our life span considerably and perhaps eventually achieving immortality. Nanotechnology, using 3D printers, would enable us to create virtually any physical product from information and inexpensive materials bringing an unlimited creation of wealth. Finally robots would be doing all the actual work, leaving humans with the choice of spending their time performing activities of their choice or working, when they want, at jobs that interest them.",

Vinge (1993:1) defines the singularity as the \"imminent creation by technology of entities with greater than human intelligence\".

Tegmark (2017) stresses that discussions of malevolent machines are a red herring, and that the control issue reduces to one of competence, whereby the true danger would exist if the goals of a competent AI, for example, diverged from ours. It is argued here that technological advances need to be harnessed to enable human collaborative problem solving, or the capabilities associated with human collective intelligence so as to address this control threat, and to ensure that human management of technology is not eclipsed by machine intelligence or outpaced simply by the increasing complexity of the management challenge itself.",

Having the management of dangerous complex technologies subject to market profitability logics can be problematic, as shown in research on nuclear technology (Osborne & Jackson, 1988) . Losing control of dangerous technologies to market power, or exposing them to the vagaries of executive risk seeking are therefore yet other dimension of the control threat.",

Joy (2000) points to how the design and use of technology has resulted in unintended consequences, such as the overuse of antibiotics which has given rise to antibiotic resistance, and drug resistant genes in Malaria parasites. Drawing from Moravec's (1999) work, he also points to an argument that biological species \"almost never survive encounters with superior competitors,\" suggesting further that in a \"completely free marketplace, superior robots\" would outcompete humans, as robotic industries \"would compete vigorously among themselves for matter, energy, and space, incidentally driving their price beyond human reach,\" whereby humans, unable to afford the necessities of life, could be \"squeezed out of existence\" (Joy, 2000:1) . This type of problem relates to the problem of crowding out, primarily related to resources, or the resource competition threat. Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) point to how technological change may ultimately displace jobs. Advances in technologies are creating an unprecedented reallocation of wealth and income. However, whereas wages have increased alongside productivity for the previous two centuries, median wages have recently stopped tracking productivity, with important societal implications. Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) stress that on account of these changes, technological change has altered certain structural economic relationships and that this is in turn driving rapidly-increasing inequality. A small elite are therefore benefitting from growth in GDP and productivity but the median income is diverging from the mean. The main driver of this increasing inequality is therefore exponential, digital and combinatory technological change driven by the new economics associated with near zero marginal cost (Rifkin, 2014) which is creating 'winner takes all' markets where leading providers (with a fraction of traditional employment costs) can capture most of a market through digitization. Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) argue that it is no longer true that a rising tide of technical progress will 'lift all boats' because technology acts as a multiplier, in that while it produces more with limited inputs, it also substitutes for workers in lower-skilled work, increasing returns to high skilled work. This then results in skill-based technical change associated with increasing inequality.",

Although this also derives from the control threat, this threat is considered more specifically to relate to the reproduction of technology, and the potential for exponential increases in the harmful effects of technology. This threat is defined here as the reproduction threat. The unchecked reproduction of nanomachines is a particular concern, according to Kurzweil (1999:158) , due to the fact that to \"be effective, nanometer-sized machines need to come in the trillions\" and the \"only way to achieve this economically is through combinatory explosion: let the machines build themselves.\" He points to the risk of an exponentially exploding nanomachine population, and the risk of even minor software problems that fail to halt self-replication. The same is true for other technologies such as biotechnology. According to Kurzweil (1999:176) , we are \"very close to the point where the knowledge and equipment in a typical graduate-school biotechnology program will be sufficient to create self-replicating pathogens.\" A theoretical model that seeks to contribute useful insights regarding the management of these threats therefore also needs to take into account the amount of time available to do this.",

Under closed systems, destructive empowerment threats would perhaps be more difficult to defend against, without the social and institutional infrastructure that open systems of innovation are rapidly developing.

Joy's (2000) perspective might be read as a metaphor, that 'technology is dangerous,' conflicting with the metaphor that 'technology will solve our problems.' Drawing directly from this is the binary conflict between the metaphors 'technology should be relinquished,' and therefore that 'closed models of development are best' versus 'technology should be shared, and open models are best to keep us safe.'

On the basis of these conceptions, the answering metaphor is perhaps that 'technological dangers can be successfully managed,' juxtaposed against its counterpoint 'technological dangers cannot be successfully managed.' The relinquishment argument of Joy (2000) might needlessly echo historical Luddite arguments if there are no other options with which to frame our response to technological dangers.

These tensions can perhaps be related to the control threat, as individuals face losing control over privacy, over the continuity of their lifestyles, or as societies lose control over widening inequality on account of the digital divide. The latter issue also relates to the power inequality threat. If the cat is out of the bag already (as the example of the publication of the H5N1 papers shows), and relinquishment may no longer be a useful strategy (as countries and individuals differ in their moral propensity to develop and use dangerous technologies (Bostrom, 2017) ), the only way out may be to radically increase our ability, as humans, to collectively manage these threats.",

The enhanced surveillance abilities of the state might also lend themselves to a change in power dynamics, and an increase in power inequality, as this power might be part of the trade-off for safety in an era in which public gatherings, for example, are increasingly vulnerable to attack. Indeed, the same technological advances can also enable destructive empowerment, as individuals can use technology to amplify the damage they can cause. The key then, might be to therefore consider such management according to the principles of openness, and the democratisation of science, and its attendant ethical framework. According to the principles of maximum transparency and accountability, power inequality is reduced, and power over knowledge is made to be more equitable. In this way, inequality in the outcomes of knowledge is also reduced, maximising benefits to all affected by science as well as the problems it is tasked to solve.",

Fewer coordinative mechanisms between functional departments, more levels of administration, centralization and higher numbers of employees may constrain an organization's ability to respond to safety issues (Osborne & Jackson, 1988) . Risk preferences are also not constant over different types of decision making (Osborne & Jackson, 1988) . Indeed, under conditions of growing losses, decisions are typically more risky than they are under conditions of gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) . Osborne and Jackson (1988:930) therefore suggest that the proportion of a utility's investment in a dangerous technology like nuclear power \"partially reflects the technological risk preferences of its senior executives.\" Developing and empowering technology safety researchers as an important stakeholder group may therefore be an urgent need, so as to ensure that the post-trial-and-error paradigm is safely managed through more inclusive engagement going forward.",

Another channel might be through the erosion of jobs that fall below the 'waterline' of advancing machine intelligence, empowering a class of workers in areas that machines have not yet mastered (Tegmark, 2017) .

According to Tarko and Aligica (2011) ), terms associated with this phenomenon include Wikinomics (Tapscott & Williams, 2006) , the wisdom of crowds (Surowiecki, 2004) , the \"army of Davids\" (Reynolds, 2006) , and \"collective intelligence\" (Malone, Laubacher, & Dellarocas, 2009 ). Malone et al. (2009:2) also acknowledge other additional descriptions of the phenomenon in the literature, such as radical decentralization, crowd-sourcing, and peer production, arguing that the term collective intelligence is the most useful, defined broadly as \"groups of individuals doing things collectively that seem intelligent.\" The phenomenon has also been defined as crowdsourced R&D, and considered in terms of its roots in the seminal knowledge aggregation problem with a view to formalising this both as a body of theory and as a new scientific methodology in its own right (Callaghan, 2016) .

The democratization of science movement stresses the increasing importance of disclosure and transparency issues not only in the contemporary bioethics field, but in broader areas of technology governance. The concept of ethical practice in this literature highlights the importance of increased transparency together with increased accountability to stakeholders. This perspective echoes the emergence of new movements, such as those associated with citizen science (CS) (Bonney et al., 2009) , public participation in scientific research (PPSR) (Shirk et al., 2012) , and participant-led biomedical research (PLR) (Vayena & Tasioulas, 2013) , which all relate to increasing access of citizens, or populations to the research process itself. These movements are in turn related to postnormal science (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1994) , and its ethical framework premised on the need for maximized transparency and accountability. The need for the post-normal science ethical approach arose from the tensions between different perspectives of climate science, whereby only through maximized transparency could the necessary scrutiny of research findings result (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1994) . These bodies of theory extend stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984) and may form the basis for a complementary model of ethics in science that is robust to technological change.",

In fact, Nielsen's (2012) theory is perhaps foreshadowed by prior examples of the same phenomenon in the futures literature (see Tarko & Aligica, 2011) . These changes also seem to echo Sardar's (2010) principles, in that networked science transcends disciplines (first law), incorporates maximised diversity and inclusivity (openness) across society (second law), thereby mitigating the uncertainties (third law) inherent in the interactions of human agency with technological change though the dispersion of power and the empowerment of the scientific citizen. Such changes in the processes of science, or scientific research itself may make it possible to develop the management capabilities to address the control threat. A synthesis of this literature suggests, however, that there are two necessary (but not sufficient) conditions to the successful management of the control threat, namely the need for openness as a primary mode of discovery, and the need for dispersion in the power relationships around the management of dangerous technologies. From this body of theory, the following proposition is derived.",

However, because transparency and accountability, as well as the ethical framework related to this, is but a necessary condition, and not a sufficient condition for the effective management of technological change, it is argued that a further condition is necessary, namely the need for dispersed power relationships, whereby dominant elites do not gain control of the discovery process, resulting in inequitable access to it, and unequal access to its outcomes.",

A better solution therefore might not be the curtailment of material progress but the mitigation of the power of knowledge associated unequal concentration. Whereby openness ensures access to information and knowledge for affected populations, what is additionally needed is a mechanism to ensure the dispersion of power, or a mechanism to address power inequality, and to address threats of control.

Pharmaceutical investments, for example, will be skewed towards wealthy markets, and poorer populations will typically be disadvantaged if there is no mechanism through which firms can obtain returns on investment without targeting only markets wealthy enough to recoup investment costs.

This is the state predicted by probabilistic innovation theory, whereby innovation failure, or gridlock persists on account of a failure to taking advantage of the exponentially increasing economies of scale in data analysis that are currently offered by technologies that already exist (Callaghan, 2016) . Some have argued that in pharmaceutical innovation, for example, returns on investment have been stagnant for decades now. Although power is concentrated in markets, and innovation outcomes are inequitably distributed, the monopoly structure does not explicitly shut out new entrants, and the discovery system is considered to be open to disruption. This is broadly considered to reflect the current state of affairs. Because there is no explicit closure of the discovery process, the outcomes of discovery might be considered to be probabilistically related to investments in the discovery process. In others words, there is investment risk associated with innovation investments, but this risk can largely be quantified. Investment in innovation is not fundamentally uncertain in its outcomes.",

He suggests that collective intelligence is emergent, in much the same way as the connections in an individual's brain exhibit 'emergent' intelligence. He offers the notion that the brute number of connections in a human brain account for an individual's intelligence, and that if the brute number of human connections in the world matched this number of brain connections then collective human behaviour would relatively be as intelligence as an average human.

(2017) however caution that their results demonstrate that \"legal and social limitations on computerization are key to ensuring an economically viable future for humanity.\" Therefore controlling the crossover rate of occupations between susceptible and non-susceptible states \"will help reduce the proportion of susceptible occupations in the economy (p.6).\" Kim et al. (2017:8) also suggest that with regard to employment loss due to technology, the \"most viable solution for long-term success, however, may be a large-scale revision of the education system, in order to better equip future employees with the skills that will be necessary in a human-machine hybrid economy.\" It is argued here that an age of effectiveness is perhaps possible, as long as openness is used to increase connectivity and collaboration between humans, which might allow collective intelligence to be used to leverage human management capabilities. It is also argued that human agency is also key to this challenge, and that there are ways to meet these challenges, but these might require action in the present. A careful consideration is necessary now, to understand how the education system, for example, and other human systems, can be reconfigured to meet these future challenges. Table 1 summarises concepts derived from the discussions above, and relates certain key challenges to each of the technological scenarios, or modes of discovery identified in Fig. 2 . Further discussion of these relationships is offered in this table.",

This is considered a probabilistic era as outcomes can be calculated as risk. Dispersed power relationships mitigate the control and the power inequality threats. Destructive empowerment in the form of harmful activities are more effectively managed using the enhanced response capabilities associated with openness and distributed networks of collaborators. Accelerated problem solving may result under systems of collaborative problem solving, with lower power asymmetries providing the ability to harness the economies of scale of collective problem solving. Under conditions of technological change, which might be unforeseen, and therefore difficult to predict, it is arguably this quadrant which provides the most effective response to these potential dangers. Threats related to resource competition are also perhaps more effectively managed by the approach described by this quadrant. Arguably, the self-reproduction of artificial intelligence is a state that is subject to the extent to which technological change can be managed, and it is also this quadrant that provides the most useful approach to this. Similarly, the societal changes that influence human work are also, to some extent, a function of the effectiveness of the management of these changes.",

This article sought primarily to provoke further engagement with certain issues surrounding the development of dangerous technologies and their ultimate societal impact. The analysis undertaken here is however based on a critical review of literature, and therefore premised on subjective judgements of what aspects to prioritise in discussions. What insights were gained by the choices made here were necessarily at the cost of that lost by not considering other aspects. For example, anchoring the work on discussions of transparency and accountability as aspects of openness was based on the growing literature on responsible innovation, which was given priority. The choice to prioritise these perspectives was taken due to their accordance with the primary arguments of technology futures experts such as Bostrom and Tegmark. Given the need to subjectively provide an ordering, according to importance, of ideas and theory in this area, the analysis sought to draw on only what was taken to be the most salient work.

Certain key threats associated with the future proliferation of technology were identified. A theoretical model was developed, on the basis of theoretical propositions derived from the literature. Using these propositions as a heuristic frame, four future scenarios were identified, predicting different societal outcomes for different permutations of openness and the power of elites. Under conditions of high power and low openness, it was predicted that powerful elites might control innovation at the expense of relatively less powerful populations. The current global state of discovery was considered to be categorised by a mode of low power and low openness, associated with innovation gridlock, whereby few have access to the discovery process and slow innovation, particularly Incentives are balanced, with institutions developing to maintain balance between private and societally important innovations due to more effective global management of discovery itself.",

Under conditions of high power and high openness, however, the consequences of technological advancement and proliferation were taken to be uncertain, as the discovery process might be dominated by powerful elites who have the power to either curtail innovation or enable the proliferation of dangerous technologies. It was finally argued that conditions of high openness and high power dispersion might be optimal for the development of the management capabilities required to successfully manage technological change, and that technology itself may hold the key to developing these capabilities. According to this pragmatic perspective, an important avenue for future research is how collective intelligence might be leveraged using technology, as this might offer a useful approach to keeping pace with machine intelligence and other threats associated with a technological future. Ironically, it is typically only in the face of a common threat that humans become united, and seek radically improved collaborations. Uniting now, in the present, to develop radically enhanced collaborative capabilities might be our saving grace, and it is the responsibility of future studies to lead the way. Although recommendations were previously made throughout the above discussions, certain overarching recommendations derive from the analysis. First, given that the trial-and-error paradigm of practice and management may produce excessive risk, a new formalised approach may be necessary, and this is recommended. If a single mistake can have catastrophic consequences, then technology safety research should be an integral part of the technology development process. This may require openness and an explicit focus on the dispersion of societal power relationships so as to empower responsible innovation that is transparent in terms of its dangers.",

The futures literature is well placed to lead the way with this.",

By interrogating wicked problems related to technological proliferation, and formulating appropriate alternative technological scenarios, we will be better able to prepare for them in the present, otherwise certain of these less desirable scenarios may ultimately come to characterise the present.",

Lack of ethical oversight and no way to enforce it.Openness allows ethical oversight that might mitigate a greater potential for technological change on account of openness.Current paradigm of research and R&D in which a lack of innovation and progress against societal outcomes is unethical in itself.Maximized transparency and accountability together with low information and power asymmetry reflect a strong ethical engagement. Private incentives dominate, with few incentives for societally important discovery.Incentives are emergent, and uncertain, as rapid technological change from openness can be captured by more powerful groups.",
