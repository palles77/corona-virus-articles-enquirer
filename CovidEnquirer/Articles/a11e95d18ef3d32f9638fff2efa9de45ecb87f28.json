CypA is the most prevalent of the 19 human Cyps, and plays a crucial role in viral infectivity, most notably for HIV-1 and HCV. Cyclophilins have been shown to play key roles in effective replication of a number of viruses from different families. A drug template for CypA inhibition is cyclosporine A (CsA), a cyclic undecapeptide that simultaneously binds to both CypA and the Ca 2+ -dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CN), and can attenuate immune responses. Synthetic modifications of the CsA scaffold allows for selective binding to CypA and CN separately, thus providing access to novel, non-immunosuppressive antiviral agents.",

            "text": "Cyclophilins: The cyclophilin (Cyp) class of proteins shares a common enzymatic activity, that of a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase), which effects a cis-trans isomerization of amide bonds N-terminal to proline (Pro) residues, and thus play a regulatory role in protein folding. 5 At least 20 members of the Cyp class have been identified in humans, 6 with sizes ranging from small, single PPIase-domain Cyps (CypA, CypB, CypC, CypD, CypJ, PPIL1, PPIAL4, and USA-Cyp) to large multi-domain proteins in which a catalytic PPIase activity is linked to various additional activities (Fig. 1) . 7 CypA is the most abundantly expressed member of the class, representing the majority of the PPIase activity in a cell, with CypB being the only other Cyp found above trace level. In addition to the Cyps, two other families of proteins, FKBPs and parvulins ( Fig. 1) , have been described with similar PPIase activity. 8 Inhibi-tion of the PPIase activity of FKBPs by either FK506 or rapamycin was shown to be required for the immunosuppressive activity of these compounds. 9 The parvulins are responsible for the cis-trans isomerization of PO 3 H 2 Ser (PO 3 H 2 Thr)-Pro bonds; however, they are much less well studied. 10 One key member of the parvulin class, Pin1, interacts with phosphoproteins involved in the cell cycle of some cancer cells; 10 however, the lack of potent and selective inhibitors for parvulins has limited research in this area. 10, 11 Cyps show widely differing expression profiles, with CypA being found predominantly in the cytoplasm, while more restricted localization is observed for CypB (endoplasmic reticulum), CypD (mitochondrial inner membrane), CypE (nucleus), and RanBP2 (nuclear pore). 6 Studies directed at the functional characterization of CypA, CypB, CypD and Cyp40 have been reported over the last 20 years; 5b however, native roles for the majority of the class, and potential roles in disease states, have not yet been elucidated.",

            "text": "Several mechanisms by which Cyps catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of an Xaa-Pro bond have been proposed; however, the currently accepted mode of catalysis is based on distortion of the planar amide bond (Fig. 2) . 12 Binding of a Pro-containing substrate in a manner that twists the amide bond leads to a lower barrier to rotation due to loss of amide resonance. 13 An important hydrogen bond between an active site residue (side chain of Arg55 in CypA) and the prolyl amide nitrogen facilitates the formation of a pyramidal nitrogen, which is a key feature of the isomerization. 14 Notably, mutation of Arg55 results in a 'catalytically inactive' form of CypA, which has been used extensively as a mechanistic probe. 15 Crystal structure analysis of several Pro-containing substrate peptides bound to human CypA revealed that all ligands evaluated bound with the Xaa-Pro bond in the cis conformation and with no distortion from planarity. 16 Since most Xaa-Pro amide bonds reside preferably (5-to 6-fold preference) in the trans conformation, Ke proposed that the principle role of Cyps is to facilitate a trans to cis isomerization. 14, 16 While the PPIase activity of Cyps has been well studied, several additional roles for Cyps have also been described. Binding of either CypA or CypB to CD-147/EMMPRIN, an extracellular receptor for CypA, leads to activation of MAP kinase pathways and induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) production. 17 A role for CypA as an inflammatory chemotactic cytokine, acting through the CD-147/EMMPRIN receptor, was revealed using a murine model of asthma in which blocking the CypA-CD-147 interaction with anti-CD-147, or CsA, resulted in a significant decrease in neutrophil and eosinophil migration, and improved lung pathology. 18 Further roles for extracellular Cyps in renal fibrosis 19 and ischemia-reperfusion injury 20 have been described with CD-147/EMMPRIN being a key activating receptor. 21 The discovery that CypA is a requisite binding protein for the immunosuppressive activity of CsA served to place CypA firmly within the sphere of immunology research. The demonstration that this binary CypA:CsA complex inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase activity of calcineurin (CN), leading to inhibition of key activators of T-cells, provides a compelling explanation of the immunosuppressive activity of CsA. 22 SAR studies performed on CsA allowed two discrete 'faces' to be ascribed to CsA, reflecting how affinity for each protein is affected by modification of various regions of CsA (1, Fig. 3 ).",

            "text": "Initial reports of CsA inhibiting HIV-1 surfaced in 1988, 25 although the first report specifically implicating CypA involvement in the HIV-1 life cycle was published five years later when it was reported that endogenous CypA colocalizes with the HIV-1 Gag protein in the cytoplasm, binding specifically to a Pro-rich sequence in the HIV-1 capsid domain of Gag. 26 X-ray crystallography later revealed that residues 85-93 of HIV-1 capsid bind to the active site of CypA, 27 and subsequent studies have shown that virions produced in the presence of Gag mutated in the CypA binding region, or under pressure from competitive CypA inhibitors, were less infectious than wild type virions. 27 CypA is then incorporated into nascent HIV-1 virions during the assembly and budding process. 4a facilitates uncoating of the capsid and supports sufficient reverse transcription of the viral genome. 28 More recent studies, however, have suggested that CypA in the infected target cell, and not CypA from HIV-1 virions, is more important to HIV-1 infectivity. 29 It has been further shown that CypA in the target cell increases HIV-1 infectivity by inhibiting host cell restriction factors mounted as part of an innate immune response that ordinarily combats invading retroviruses. 30 Reducing the CypA-capsid interaction either by mutations altering binding of CypA to capsid, or by the introduction of a CypA inhibitor such as CsA, has been shown to increase HIV-1 susceptibility to TRIM5a restriction. 30 Other recent studies have suggested that CypA binds to HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr), which undergoes cis-trans isomerization of Pro residues in its Nterminal region. This activation by CypA ultimately governs the functional expression of Vpr, which is needed for translocation of virus to the nucleus, and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in infected T cells. 31 In summary, there are several stages in the HIV-1 life cycle that involve CypA, some understood more clearly than others. Clearly, a CypA inhibitor that bound to CypA alone and not CN would potentially be an effective anti-HIV therapeutic. Such compounds have been developed, and will be discussed in Section C.",

The demonstration that knockdown of CypA inhibited replication of a full length HCV genome significantly more effectively than a sub-genomic replicon system (NS3-NS5B) supports the idea that CypA is involved in interactions with HCV proteins other than NS5A and NS5B. 24b Details of the specific role of CypA in the HCV replication complex have recently appeared; however, a consensus mechanism has not emerged. While it is clear that CypA is an essential component of the HCV replication complex, different models have been proposed to explain this requirement, including a role in actively incorporating NS5B into the replication complex 37a versus a model whereby CypA, pre-residing in crude replication complex membrane fractions, serves to associate NS5A-NS5B into an assembling replication complex. 39 Clues toward an understanding of the role that CypA PPIase activity might play in HCV RNA replication were presented by Bartenschlager 24b in a study of the rate of HCV polyprotein processing. A resistance mutation to the Cyp inhibitor Alisporivir, occurring near the cleavage site of the NS5A-NS5B polyprotein, resulted in delayed processing of the protein and impaired replication activity. 24b This suggests that CypA may be required to allow the NS5A-NS5B protein to achieve the required conformation to allow effective cleavage. The virus may escape the need for CypA at a specific location by mutation of residues close to the cleavage site that introduce more conformational flexibility, however this comes at a cost to the virus of impaired replication capacity. The high barrier to resistance to a Cyp inhibitor may result from the need for multiple virus mutations to appear to escape the need for all CypA mediated reorganizations, with each mutation incurring a replication 'fitness' cost.",

Silencing CypA resulted in a decrease in interferon-b production and an increase in viral replication, with both effects being reported to be independent of the PPIase activity of CypA. 50 A role for Cyps in signaling pathways that are activated following viral infection was first suggested by the demonstration that CypB is involved in regulation of IRF-3. 52 Knockdown of CypB was found to suppress Newcastle Disease Virus-induced phosphorylation of IRF-3, which blocked IRF-3 dimerization and inhibited the production of interferon-b. A recent report from Hopkins 53 describes a novel induction of type I and III interferons in HCV-infected patients following treatment with the non-immunosuppressive Cyp inhibitor SCY-635.

The (4R)-4-[(E)-2-butenyl]-4methyl-L-threonine (MeBmt) group at position 1 is unique in that it resides in the Cyp binding domain, yet its sidechain drapes across the CsA scaffold and ultimately into the CN binding domain (Fig. 4) . In general, modifications to MeBmt tend to decrease Cyp binding. Removing or altering the stereochemistry of the 2-methyl group reduces activity, as does introducing a second methyl group at this position. 54 Likewise, removing, replacing, or capping the 3 0hydroxy as an ester also reduces potency. 55 One case in which Cyp binding is actually improved is when the C@C double bond is replaced with a bioisosteric sulfur atom ('MeThiaBmt'), which was found to bind to Cyp with 178% of the affinity of CsA itself. 54b The 3 CsA bind to Cyp with affinity comparable to that of CsA, 55a while [D-MeSer] 3 CsA binds to Cyp with over threefold greater affinity than CsA. 57 This is an important attribute that has been exploited in the design of CsA-based therapeutics.",

Sanglifehrin A (Fig. 7) is a natural product that was first described in 1999 and shown to be a potent inhibitor of CypA. 78 Derivatives of Sanglifehrin A have been described with good anti-HCV activity; however, these compounds have not yet progressed to clinical studies. 79 In conclusion, Cyp inhibition has emerged, over the last 10 years, from a supporting role required for immunosuppression via CN inhibition, into a viable approach towards treating a wide variety of disease states of which virology is the most mature. Host Cyps are clearly hijacked by several viruses to enable effective replication, and Cyp inhibition offers a promising new approach to antiviral therapy. The additional finding that Cyp inhibition plays a role in uncloaking a virus (HCV) to immune surveillance is potentially exciting; however, discovery efforts in this field are likely to be challenging, as many in vitro virus infection screening systems are successful due to an immunological defect that renders the host cell permissive to viral infection.",

As the biology of Cyps continues to unfold, the challenges to medicinal chemistry will be to discover compounds that can selectively inhibit members of the Cyp family, and to use these tools to validate the role of Cyps in disease states and as leads for drug discovery efforts. While CsA has served admirably as the starting point for Cyp research, little selectivity within the Cyp family has been described for derivatives of this compound. New inhibitory templates are beginning to appear that may deliver improved selectivity; however, the application of fragment-based screening, with the aid of available structural data to support the location of binding, should allow inhibitors to be designed that exploit regions of the Cyp protein that differ among family members.
