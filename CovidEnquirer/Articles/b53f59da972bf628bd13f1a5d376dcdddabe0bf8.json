Our first contact with NIAID on the possibility of developing an inactivated vaccine occurred in the first quarter of 2003. Sanofi pasteur was one of only two companies that satisfied the NIAID's eligibility criteria. The solicitation and funding mechanism that NIAID employed was a directed Request for Proposals (RFP).

While the first wave of the SARS epidemic seemed to have reached its conclusion, it was completely unclear how the spread of the virus would evolve. There was no clear understanding of the animal reservoir and the impact of virus mutation and unapparent infections. Different situations could be envisaged; one scenario was that virulent SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV) would persist and become endemic. Another possibility was that other epidemic waves would occur or, finally, that the virus would disappear.

We will review the decision-making process, the strategic choices made in terms of vaccine candidate, adjuvants, working conditions, and the safety precautions implemented at the beginning and throughout the entire production process of the SARS vaccine. In addition, we will discuss the unique challenges associated with moving a vaccine such as SARS through the regulatory process. with such a highly pathogenic, unknown virus. We will emphasize the industrial perspectives on inactivation and decontamination experiments, the selection of the most promising vaccine candidate, the production process and the choice and use of animal models in such a pressing and difficult situation. Finally, we will briefly review the unique regulatory environment created during this period for the development of a SARS vaccine. the absolute eligibility criteria, vaccine characteristics, and project objectives are clearly defined; the proposal review cycle is very short; and the necessary financial resources are immediately available. In this particular case, the RFP was received by us on May 23, and we submitted our project plan and budget by June 16. Preliminary work began in July and August, and by the third week of September 2003, we had a fully executed contract. By October 2004, our inactivated prototype SARS vaccine was filled and available for clinical assessment. Another positive aspect of this mechanism is that involvement of such a large research organization provides the potential to access the expertise of many different investigators, as technical problems may arise. Unlike traditional research grants, these types of contracts have very short duration and, consistent with the sense of urgency, progress against objectives is monitored on a weekly basis, perhaps, contributing to the fact that our project finished almost a month ahead of schedule. Importantly, this type of mechanism does not compete with academic researchers for funding but allows these researchers to develop more basic science proposals of longer duration that can be reviewed and funded by other established mechanisms.",

First, information must be shared quickly and transparently. The somewhat surprising observation that the SARS-CoV grew well in Vero cells was important in prioritizing the development of an inactivated, Vero cell -derived virus. Second, there should be an ongoing dialogue between the national research organizations and their potential industrial partners to understand what capacity and experience could be urgently brought to bear in a crisis situation. Although there are potential issues with competitive intelligence, it remains important that information about industrial capability should be shared. Third, funding organizations should have in place a mechanism for rapid proposal solicitation, review and monitoring, and also adequate discretionary funding that could support new vaccine projects in an urgent manner.",

It is not exceptional for vaccine manufacturers to work in BSL3 facilities for the production of certain vaccines, e.g., rabies, Japanese encephalitits, or polio viruses. Some of these commercial vaccines have been made for decades. For these vaccines, robust production processes and standard operating procedures have been put in place. The experience gained on the decontamination and inactivation of viral vaccines during the production process and the quality control (QC) are all important. Moreover, the personnel working at the different stages of such a vaccine production are typically vaccinated, and revaccination procedures are in place in case of major accidents (i.e., boost after potential rabies contamination).",

This was indeed the case for SARS. Therefore, our first experiments were dedicated to develop routine tests that are required for vaccine development and the analysis of the host response after immunization. These include neutralization tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), and others. Well-validated reagents are needed as reference standards for essential laboratory tests as polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, and PCR primer pairs. One of the most sensitive issues was how to select an appropriate animal model to evaluate the candidate vaccines. For example, we observed that NMRI mice gave a very heterogeneous response whereas Balb-C or C57BL/6J mice responded uniformly to immunization with the vaccine candidate. Also, guinea pigs appeared to be a good model for the evaluation of immune responses. Beyond immunogenicity, it is important to work with an animal model that is appropriate for challenge studies, as an assessment of vaccine efficacy. This is especially important for emerging infections since efficacy studies in humans may not be possible. In case of the SARS, the Macaca fascicularis was identified very early on ( Fouchier et al., 2003 ) as a likely predictive, challenge model.",

Similarly, alternative routes of vaccine administration (inoculation, aerosol, etc.) and formulation (adjuvants, etc.) were considered. In fact, several live attenuated and killed vaccines for veterinary CoVs are already marketed: e.g., a live attenuated and killed vaccine against the chicken infectious bronchitis virus ( Ladman et al., 2002 ) , a live modified virus against canine CoV ( Pratelli et al., 2004 ) .

To detect adventitious agents, sensitive cell culture monolayers of CV-1 cells, human diploid MRC-5 cells, and chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were inoculated with the crude viral suspension and are observed for induced CPE and/or hemadsorption. CV-1 cells are used in these tests, as they are of the same species and the same origin as the cells used for vaccine manufacturing. MRC-5 cells are human diploid cells and can potentially reveal other viruses able to infect human cells.

At the same time, adventitious agent testing was performed on control cells (search for hemagglutining or hemadsorbant viruses) and on the supernatant of the control cells (search for adventitious agents) by inoculation of the three cell lines: Vero, MRC-5, and CEF.

The initial stages would be very similar to those followed for vaccines under development for conventional infectious diseases. In the United States, the earliest stages would include the development of sufficient preclinical information about the vaccine to allow the preparation of an investigational new drug (IND) application for submission to the FDA (see Chapter 13). The IND may have information unique to the vaccine candidate but should include information about the rationale for the vaccine design, the source of the virus and other components, the manufacture of the active vaccine component, formulation, preliminary characterization of the vaccine to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine. For these agents, it would be too dangerous to conduct challenge studies in humans and the prevalence of the disease is either nonexistent, sporadic, or too small to allow the development of a reasonable clinical protocol. In anticipation of this problem, largely in the face of potential bioterrorist agents, in 2002, the FDA adapted the so-called Animal Rule [see Federal Register, May 31, 2002 (Volume 67, Number 105) ]. Under this guidance, new drugs or biological products that are intended to prevent serious or life-threatening conditions may be approved on evidence of effectiveness derived from appropriate studies in animals and any additional supporting data, if controlled clinical studies cannot be conducted in human volunteers and field trials are not possible. In order to satisfy this alternative mechanism, however, several criteria must be met. First, there is a reasonably well-understood pathophysiological mechanism that can be ameliorated or prevented by the product. Second, the effect is demonstrated in more than one animal species, unless it is demonstrated in a single species that represents a sufficiently well-characterized animal model. Third, the animal study endpoint is clearly related to the desired benefit in humans. And finally, the data are sufficiently well understood to allow selection of an effective dose in humans. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the effectiveness of the product in animal model(s) is a reliable indicator of its effectiveness in humans.",

Finally, a series of preliminary experiments on monkeys (three months after the start of the project) had given guidance whether it was appropriate to use an inactivated vaccine, as well as to the choice of the adjuvant.",

This communication was also very important for the qualification of the viral seed lots. The qualification of the Vero cells was not an issue as several vaccines are already produced in Vero cells, but this was obviously not the case for the viral seeds. Two major obstacles had to be overcome: (1) the realization that the animal testing had to be done in BSL3 facilities by BSL3-trained personnel, and (2) the search for adventitious agents using general classical tests (search for adventitious viruses on cells and in animals) and specific tests (PCR). For the latter, there was no list available and the final testing to be performed was under the responsibility of health authorities. This resulted in a rather exhaustive list of PCR testing.",

These pathogens will be categorized as BSL3 or BSL4 pathogens needing high security level laboratories as well as specialized personnel. How to manipulate these pathogens that are highly pathogenic, in large quantities? To face the emergence of new pathogens, dedicated structures are needed with the right equipment and trained personnel. From an industrial perspective, this seems not compatible with the need and use of trained personnel and facilities that do have a constant activity to assure the production of existing vaccines and the development of new vaccines. Such emergency structures could be set up and maintained by national reference centers respecting the BSL requirements as well as the GMP conditions. It would be very beneficial for industries to collaborate with such reference centers that provide purified pathogens and reagents allowing a prompt start of a vaccine development .",
