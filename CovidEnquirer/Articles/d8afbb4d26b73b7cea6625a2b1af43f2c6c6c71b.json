Ad isolates of serotypes 1-7 grown in HEp-2 or primary rhesus monkey kidney cells were identified by neutralization. Graham 293 cell cultures were used only when specimens were found to be positive for Ad by EM, type-specific Ad40/41 EIA, and for isolates not identified by neutralization. Ads grown in 293 cells were identified by DNA restriction endonuclease analysis. Of the 1187 specimens examined, 105 (9%) were found to be positive for Ad. VC detected 93, while 12 additional positives were detected by EM or EIA. The relative sensitivity of VC, EIA, and EM for the 105 specimens was 89% (93), 45% (47), and 35% (37), respectively.

Many of the various Ad types have been isolated from stool specimens of children with gastroenteritis and are presumed by frequency of association to be causative agents of disease (Christensen, 1989; Retter et al., 1979) . However, some Ads, usu-ally of low-numbered types, have been found to be excreted, sometimes for extensive periods, without clinical symptoms (Brandt et al., 1979; Fox et al., 1977; Kidd et al., 1982) . The isolation of Ad from healthy children in some studies has made it difficult to assert that an Ad discovered in the stool of a sick child was definitively the cause of disease. In the absence of a suitable laboratory model of Ad gastroenteritis, causation of disease by these lownumbered or conventional Ad types cannot be proven and should be distinguished from enteric types.",

These types can cause severe diarrhea and have been isolated from fatal cases of gastroenteritis and observed replicating in the nuclei of gut epithelial cells (Whitelaw et al., 1977) . Ad40 and Ad41 are referred to as enteric Ads to denote their specific association with the alimentary tract (Petric et al., 1982) and their association with disease is widely accepted. Enteric Ads have fastidious culture characteristics and present a particular challenge in the diagnostic laboratory. This diagnostic difficulty has promoted considerable effort to enhance detection of enteric Ads, producing improved methods for the diagnosis of Ad40 and Ad41, including enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (August and Warford, 1987; Herrmann et al., 1987; Mortensson-Egnund and Kjeldsberg, 1986; Singh-Naz et al., 1988) , dot-blot hybridization (Hammond et al., 1987; Kidd et al., 1985) , and immune electron microscopy (EM) (Wood et al., 1989) .

Both the EIA and EM results suggest that the enteric Ads are more often present in amounts that are detectable by these techniques. Of the EIA-positive specimens, 21 demonstrated restriction patterns of a variant strain of Ad41 (Hammond et al., 1985) . The remaining eight Ad40/41 type-specific enteric EIA-positive specimens could not be cultured in 293 cells. The blocking assay was performed on five of these eight specimens and the results are shown in Table 3 . The reference strains of Ad40 (Dugan) and Ad41 (TAK) showed >50% reduction in OD with homologous Ad40 and Ad41 monoclonal antibody. With the variant strain, a partial reduction in OD (37%) of Ad41 variant and four Ad-positive specimens (varying from 12% to 33%) was seen with monoclonal antibody against Ad41. These data suggest that these culture-negative specimens may represent serotypes other than 40 or 41, or were variant enteric serotypes.
