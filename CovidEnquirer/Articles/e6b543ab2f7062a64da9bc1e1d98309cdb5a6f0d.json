Our knowledge of the biology of genes and their products, of cells and multicellular organisms and also our diagnostic and therapeutic skills in practical medicine have been greatly furthered by information drawn from immunological research. Immunology has also become more heterogeneo,-s than perhaps any other scientific discipline. No contemporary immunologist can claim to have a comprehensive understanding of his entire field. Faced with this situation -which has both merits and difficulties -the International Congress of Immunology provides a singular opportunity for the individual scientist to recognize the major avenues of immunological research and thus to define individual pathways. More than ever before do we need this forum of mutual information and learning.",

It is estimated that cver 100 000 scientists all over the world work in the many different areas of immunology. Basic questions about the structure and function of the immune system at the molecular, cellular and physiological levels are asked in many different species. Clinical observations of immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases, in inflammations and allergies, help in the search for an explanmion, and eventually for a therapy, within a rapidly expanding understanding of the immune system. This increased knowledge encourages new strategies in transplantation and in the fight against bacterial, parasitic and viral infections as well as against cancer.

This lack of opportunity to become actively involved in clinical research is well recognized and is one of the many reasons why young medical doctors seek further training abroad -particularly in the UK and the USA. A problem then arises when these doctors come home to 'nest' at German University hospitals To make further progress, the fundamental structure of the German universities needs to be analyzed. German university professors, including those at medical faculties, enjoy tenured positions from their first appointment; this makes it difficult to develop procedures for redistribution of resources according to efficiency and achievements. However, looking back at the development of clinical research in this country over the past twenty years, it can be seen that considerable progress has been made, mainly due to programs initiated and conducted by the major science organizations. The present situation should be maintained and further improved. All societies in Germaqy engaged in clinical research should continue to support the Wissenschaftsrat, the Forschungsgemeinschaft, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft and the Bundesministerium flit Forschung und Technologie. This concerted effort will then further improve clinical science in our country.",

While mechanistic aspects are pursued mostly by molecular biologists, the immunologist's interest is in the production of functional antibodies or antibody fragments from specifically designed genes. The work of two groups should be mentioned in this context. A group at Penzberg (Boehringer Mannheim) started by cloning from a hybridoma and expressing the genes for an antibody against creatine kinase 16. Their main aim is to produce antibodies of diagnostic and therapeutic value. A. PIfJckthun's Group in Munich succeeded in producinq an 'antihndy' in E. coil that consists of just the variable domains but binds phosphorylcholine wc:l117. Their objective is largely mechanistic and concerns problems such as the folding and assembly of chains and ligand binding. The hypothesis that somatic mutation contributes to antibody diversity has been disputed by immunologists ~or a long time and on occasions bitterly. Strong support for the hypothesis came from early work of Weigert and cclleagues on the primary structure of murine kl chains 1. However, direct evidence for somatic mutation in antibody V regions required molecular biology techniques that allowed the comparison of the sequences of V regions carried in the germ line with those expressed by somatic cells (reviewed in Refs 2 and 3). An early case of localized somatic hypermutation was reported by Zachau's group in Munich, who compared the productively and non-productively rearranged VK genes of a myeloma to their germ line counterparts and found multiple somatic point mutations in both 4. The ~ame group has provided further examples of somatic mutation in VK genes in the course of their work on the VK gene cluster in humans (see Zachau's contribution in this issue).",

First, the B-cell compartment of mice transgenic for fully rearranged H and L chain genes was analysed. Second, H and L chain genes were introduced into actively rearranging pre-B-cell lines and their effect on rearrangement was studied. The results of these studies are summarized in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 ). Arrest of endogenous VH gene rearrangement in transgenic mice may be due to an accelerating effect on B-cell differentiation. Since the trans-i~ is expressed earlier in ontogeny than endogenous I~ (Ref. 4 )\u00b0 B-cell development could proceed mo:e quickly to V Lrearrangement leaving fewer pre-B cells and less time for endogenous VH rearrangement. This hypothesis could explain why in these mice, Abelson-Murine-Leukemiavirus (AbI-MuLV) transformation of pre-B ce!!s ~s about 100-fold less efficient (Ref. 9; G. K6hler, unpublished). Alternatively, a direct effect of I~ in shutting down further VH rearrangements is possible. Such a negative feedback has been observed by M. Reth (Cologne) and collaborators using the AbI-MuLV transformed pre-B-cell line 300-19 (Refs 10, 11) . This line carries a DJH3 join on each Ig rl allele and continues to rearrange its VH lOCUS while growing in culture: 12 secondary D to JH4 and 19 Vto DJ rearrangements in 65 reclones were counted. When a construct coding for membrane I~ (with or without a k light chain) was introduced by DNA transfection techniques, only 2 D to JH and no VH to DJH joins were observed in 31 reclones analyzed which argues in favour of a direct negative effect of I~ in the VH-rearrangement process.",

These mice showed a similar phenotype as l~ transgenic mice 14. Since the 8 chain lacks the domains homologous to C1~2 and C1~3, it was concluded that these domains could be dispensable for the regulatory effects. In contrast, expression in mice or in a pre-Bcell line of a p, gene lacking the first constant domain did not activate VL rearrangement (G. K6hler, unpublished). Light chains interact with the VH domain, and covalently with the C1~1 domain. They are necessary for the membrane deposition or secretion of I~. Presumably the light chain displaces the heavy chain from a protein (gp78) of the endoplasmic reticulum which binds to the first constant domain of heavy chains is. If, indeed, surface expression of heavy chains in pre-B cells is a prerequisite for their regulatory function, other proteins may also be required. This points to a role of genes specifically expressed in pre-B cells called Vpre-B (Ref. 16 ) and k5 (Ref. 17) . They are homologous to the variable (V pre-B) and the constant (X 5) region of the ~, light chain and their presumptive products are expressed in association with I~ chains on the surface of some pre-B-cell lines 18.19. In addition, genes (B29, MB-1) have recently been described, that are expressed in pre-B cells and B cells 2o,21. The product of one o. these genes (MB-1) is apparently associated with the membrane I~ chain and is necessary for its surface expression 22. Furthermore, an amino acid sequence motif has been identified in the cytoplasmic portion of B29 and MB-1, which is shared by proteins forming the Fce receptor and by members of the T3complex 23. The proteins of this complex are aFsociated with the T-cell receptor and are important for its surface expression. They may also be necessary for signal transduction during antigen activation. It is conceivable that a B3-complex, with similar functions, exists for the B-cell immunoglobulin receptor and that it also plays a role in regulating early B-cell differentiation.",

Jan Klein is a real scholar, who has given us important conceptual frameworks in MHC imrnunogenetics, and has always tried to bring order into the MHC and its nomenclature. Besides a vast number of papers, he has also written several important textbooks in which he does not hesitate to express his personal opinion, usually in a refreshing historical perspective. His Natural History of the MHC Complex 2 is excellent -delightful to read and an endless source of information. His witty and cutting commentaries in the 'Odd Page' of his journal Immunogenetics are also delightful to read.

Jan Klein is not someone who avoids controversies. When he and Zoltan Nagy observed that liposomes can stimulate class-ll-restricted T-cell clones, he proposed that antigen processing was not always necessary -a conclusion that is disputed by other investigators.

Subsequent studies showed that the transfected class I molecule provided the H-2 restriction element required for the recognition of a tumor antigen by CTL While it is accepted that CTL require class-l-positive target cells in several systems, an inverse correlation between natural killer (NK) lysis and class I expression on the NK targets has been observed. In H-2 gene transfection studies, SturmhOfel and Hammerling showed that the expression of the class I antigens was directly responsible for the increased resistance to NK lysis. The importance of MHC antigens for ~tumor growth led to studies on the molecular regulation of MHC expression. U. Maschek has found that K and D genes can be silent because of changes in the chromatin st~uc- Kvist (the latter working at the EMBL). These early studies showed that the class I determinants seen by CTL were exclusively formed by the ~1 and a2 domains 1\u00b0, which is con-sist~,~t with the picture derived from Bj6rkman's crystallographic structure of the HLA-A2 molecule. However, the ~3 domain is also important because it is involved in the interaction between the Lyt-2 accessory molecule and H-2 class I (B. Arnold, U. Kalinke and G. J. Hammerling in collaboration with A. H6veler, B. Malissen and A. Schrnitt-Verhulst in Marseille). These authors also observed a species-specific barrier because in mouse T cells the human CD8 molecule could not take over the function of Lyt-2. Preliminary evidence suggests that this CDS/class I species barrier is also the explanation for the notoriously weak xenogeneic CTL responses in comparison with the powerful alloresponses. Modifying what Jan Klein has said about alloreactivity, this perception of xenoreactivity would be the 'crown-D. Klar has identified a defect at the post-translational level. In these tumors H-2 and 13z-microglobulin coexist without assembly. However, assembly and cell surface expression can be induced by stimulation with gamma-interferon (IFN-~/) which indicates that cellular factors may be required for an efficient assembly 12.",

These mice were not tolerant to membrane bound K k because they could still make Kk-specific CTL and antibodies, possibly because soluble K k cannot efficiently crosslink receptors or interact with Lyt-2. In all textbooks, the HLA-C antigens are attributed with the same functions as HLA-A and HLA-B although no experimental data existed to support this assumption. Using HLA-Cw3 transgenic mice, Dill and colleagues ~5 first showed that HLA-C could indeed function as a transplantation antigen anc~ as an MHC restriction element.

The li sequence exhibits some similarities with the transferrin receptor -such as a fatty acylated cysteine close to the transmemblane region -and a sequence motif which is important for the recycling of the transferrin receptor.

Dobberstein's group at the EMBL use the li chain in order to understand how such class II proteins are transported through the various cellular compartments. Since the li chain is found in the endosomal compartment, it is possible that it transports the class II antigens to this compartment, where the class II molecules could meet peptides of endocytosed and processed antigens. In fact, recent studies by Stockinger and Koch suggest that the presence of the li chain is necessary for efficient antigen presentation by class-IItransfected fibroblasts 23.

A cobra venom factor, (CVF) was recognized as an anaphylatoxinreleasing substance and was also purified. A heat-labile cofactor essential for the activity of CVF was discovered in serum, and later identified as factor B. The interaction of factors B, D and CVF or C3b was analyzed and it was established that factor D could be replaced by trypsin. The reason that C5 activat,on is restricted to surfaces and the role of C3b as a ligand for native C5 rendering it accessible to either convertase was also recognized. Recently, a non-enzymic mechanism of C5 activation was discovered -oxidation by OH radicals. This indicates a positive feedback in inflammation, since the radicals are products of complement-stimulated leukocytes. B.

Both ligands, either in purir'r I produce a strong triggering signal to cells, which is selective for alternative pathway activation, These ligands interact with CD2 via two sites against which individual mAbs have been produced (termed anti-T111A and anti-T111B), TI I ~A is apparently the triggering site for LFA-3/TI ITS whereas, in contrast, the T111B site is a binding domain for the ph,,'siological ligands (LFA-3, T11TS) . Reagents that selectively b~ock the signal provided through CD2-LFA-3 have allowed the role of the CD2-mediated pathway of T-cell activation in physiological immune responses (for example to soluble antigens or alloantigens) to be studied. It was found that a considerable proportion of immune responses is apparently mediated through CD2. Given these results, it seems hardly surprising that some types of immunodeficiency are related to a failure to activate human T cells via CD2. The existence of lymphocytes ex-pf~.19 uuul Ti-CD3 clnu--~ CD2, which, however, cannot be triggered through CD2 (see above) suggest that additional molecules are required or involved in T-cell activation through the alternative pathway. This notion is formally supported by gene transfer experiments showing that transfection of CD2 genes in non-lymphoid cells is not r;uffic;ent for mediating signals such as calcium mobilization through this molecule. Such findings have prompted experiments to identify additional cell surface molecules that may be associated with CD2 in T-cell triggering. To ~his end, mAbs were produced and screened for their capacity to supplement a submitogenic signal mediated by antibodies directed a( CD2 in vitro. Such antibodies were recently found and shown to be reactive with molecules of the CD45 (leucocyte common antigen) family.

In both models, ultrastructural studies demonstrated discrete intra-Islet iniiltration by macrophages preceding diabetes manifestation (Victoria Kolb-Bachofen). Administration of silica, which can inhibit macrophage activity almost completely prevented disease development in these animal models. Accordingly, macrophages were assigned an essentia! roie in the early phase of the disease process. They suggested that prevalence of macrophages able to engulf islet cells in the prediabetic phase indicates their cytotoxic activity towards 13 cells. Currently, they are analysing mechanism(s) of macrophage-mediated islet cell lysis in vitro. Their data on the preventive effect of T-ceU depletion and/or inactivation on diabetes development in IDDM animal models are in agreement with those reported by other laboratories. In addition, the effect of various immunemodulating compounds on the disease process is under investigation, with a view to designing a thera-S34 peutic regimen applicable in clinical trials. Thomas Linn and Konrad Federhn at the Clinical Department of the Justus Liebig University of Giel3en are also engaged in defining the sequence of events leading to 13-cell destruction in the STZ model. They found an STZ-induced prevalence of intra-islet macrophages at early disease stages, and increased MHC class ~1 antigen expression on infiltrating mononuclear cells, but not on 13 cells. Another aspect of their research is to abrogate the ~-celldestructive process by dietary compounds such as co-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

One of the approaches that is widely used to determine the tissue origin of carcinomas and their metastases is the definition of their reactivity with anti-o~okeratin anti= bodies 4. The development of this approach resulted from intensive collaboration between the groups of W.W. Franke (Heidelberg) and K. Weber and M. Osbom (GOttingen), who identified and characterized the cytokeratins expressed by various tissues. Recently, it has been possible to detect bone-marrow micrometastases using anti-cytokeratin anti-bodies that can dlsting_,ish the tumor cells (which are of epithelial origin) from the bone-marrow cells and stroma. The presence of such micrometastases in patients with no other sign of metastatic disease is predictive of the development of frank metastatic disease s .",

Macher, MQnster; J. Johnson, G. RiethmOller, Munich). Two molecules expressecl by melanomas with a high risk of metastasis have been cloned; one (MUC18) is a cell surface molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and showing sequence similarity to a group of neural cell adhesion molecules and to CEA. The second molecule is the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (Ref. 9). A molecule whose expression is associated with malignant transformation in a variety of human tumors has also recently been shown to be a cell adhesion molecule (E. Klein, Ulm). Thus a variety of different adhesion molecules may play roles in the development and progression of malignancies. The lymphocyte homing receptors with differing organ specificities may also be involved and recent studies show that they can be selective!y regulated upon cell activation (A. Hamann, Hamburg).",

P.Klein  started his research in 1962 at the Institut for Medizinische Mikrobiologie in Mainz. In association with H.J. Wellensiek, his work at the time centered around the description of the 'classical C3 complex', leading to the identification of the components C3, (_5, C6, C7, C8 and C9. Many 'second generation' complementologists, such as H.J. Wellensiek, W. Opferkuch, D. Bitter-Suermann, U. Hadding, M.P. Dierich, M. Loos, R. Burger and H.P. Heinz, now continue this work in their own groups and institutions. Their contributions, and those of their coworkers, to the field of complement research are discussed below. K. Rother and U. Rother started working in Freiburg at the Max-Planck-lnstitut for Immunbiologie and continued in Heidelberg at the Institut for Immunologie und Serologie. Their main contributions were the description of a genetic C6-deficiency in rabbits, of a leuco-H 1989, Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd, UK. 0167~,919/89/$02.00cyte mobilizing factor, generated from C3 and later identified as C3e, and studies on the role of C5 in initiating the lytic events (deviated lysis) of complement.

Vogt in GOtlingen at the Max-Planck-lnstitut for Experimentelle Medizin was more interested in the specialized field of anaphylatoxic peptides, their enzymatic generation and their promolecules. He was one of the first to characterize CSa (porcine). His co-workers, V. Brade, the late B. Damerau and I.V. Zabern, contributed to the renown of this lab.Finally, H. M011er-Eberhard from Scripps Clinic and Research Institute, La Jolla, now chairman of the Bernhard Nocht-lnstitut for Tropische Medizin, Hamburg, supported the rebirth of complement research in Germany and from the very beginning was a major contributor to it. He trained several postdoctoral fellows (such as U. Hadding, the late V. Bokisch, O. GOtze and H.

Reske-Kunz and their associates in Mainz have investigated the signals required for the kinetics of IL-2 receptor expression in T-cell clones after activation and the possible physiological role of soluble IL-2 receptors 17. Activated helper T cells secrete lymphokines which have pleiotropic effects on the secreting T cells, T cells of the same or different subsets, B cells, macrophages and cells outside the immune system. The T-cell-tropic lymphokines include T-cell cytotoxicity inducing factor 1 (TCF-1), which induces growth and maturation of precursors of cytotoxic T cells (W. Falk, Mannel, and W. Dr6ge. Heidelberg 18). Lymphokines with activity on B cells include T-cell replacing factor (TRF) and 11_-4. Late TRF activity as initially described was thought to be mediated by one factor but has proved to involve various factors (for example, IL-4, IL-5) depending on the type of B cell studied and the degree of antigen receptor engagement (A. Schimpl and E. Wecker, WQrzburg). The work on IL-4 as a lymphokine that induces isotype switching of lipopolysaccharide prestimulated murine B cells towards IgG1 and IgE, was started by Vitetta (Dallas), P. Krammer (Heidelberg) 19, Coffman (Palo Alto) 2o and their groups and is also investigated by K. Rajewski's group (Cologne), by A. Radbruch and MQIler and their associates. Their results, using molecular biological techniques, suggest that IL-4, as previously suspected from immunoglobulin isotype tests with B cells in limiting dilution, actually induces immunogiobulin isotype switching rather than expanding ~-cell clones which have already switched to a particular immunoglobulin isotype 21. T-cell derived lymphokines also stimulate macrophages and lead to their activation to different functions. Signals important for macrophage activation are investigated by the groups of D. Gemsa (Marburg) 22, H. Kirchner (LQbeck) 23, P. Krammer (Heidelberg) 24, M. Lohmann-M:~tthes (Hannover) 2s and R611inghoff (Erlangen) 26. Since gamma-interferon (IFN-~/) has emerged as the first macrophage activating factor (MAF) acting in conjunction with lipopolysaccharide, a number of different MAFs has been described which activate macrophages either alone or in combination with IFN-~. Thus, IL-4 and colonystimulating factors (CSFs) can have MAF activities. In addition, P. Krammer and D. Gemsa showed that IFN-~ in combination with lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activate macrophages. Macrophages activated by T-cell derived lymphokines or directly by tumor cells (D.

Meyer zum Bueschenfelde (Department of Internal Medicine) and their co-workers are investigating the pathogenesis of non-viral hepatitis. Studies pioneered by P. Beaune, Paris, established that patients suffering from drug-induced hepatitis produce autoantibodies against that particular isoform of hepatic cytochrome P450 that is responsible for metabolizing the inducing drug. Z. Ametizat et aL (Mainz) observed that autoantibodies against o/tochrome P450 are a general phenomenon in patients suffering from idiopathic c!',ronic hepatitis, sugge~ ing ~hat chemicals are involved in the etiopathogenesis of such cases. Current research by E. Gleichmann's group (Medical Institute of Environmental Hygiene, DOsseldorf) focusses on the GVH-like autoimmune disease inducible by HgCl2. Based on the work of P. Druet (Paris) and others, a mouse model has been established. Upon treatment with hgCl2, susceptible strains develop high serum igG and IgE levels and extremely high titers of antinucleolar autoantibodies (ANolA). In association with R. LOhrmann's group (Marburg) fibrillarir,, a component of U3 snRNP, and an snRNP of more than 90 kDa were identified as the major antigens detected by these AnolA. Very similar, if not identical, autoantibodies occur in idiopathic scleroderma and GVH mice. Injection of anti-interleukin 4 (IL-4) into HgCI2-treated mice abrogate(J the enhanced IgE formation, indicating that HgCl2 activates the helper T cell subpopulation, TH2 (M. Ochel and H-W. Vohr). Susceptible mouse strains treated with HgCIz contain T cells primed to HgCI2 as the nominal antigen. This finding is consistent with a GVH-like pathogene:!: ofHgCI2-induced autoimmunity. The MHC plays a major role in determining susceptibility to the HgCI2induced autoimmune disease. While susceptibility to ANolA formation is determined by I-A s, concomitant ,.xpression of I-E significantly suppresses it. Thus, this response to selfantigen follows the rules established for responses to nonself-antigens, as established by C. Baxevanis, Zoltan Nagy and Jan Klein (Max-Planck-Institut for Biology, TObingen) and evident in a variety of murine parasite infections (Chella David, Rochester), including Plasmodium chabaudi (F.

When it became clear that the tools and concepts of cellular immunology, imrnunomgulation and molecular biology could be used in the analysis of complex host-parasite interactions, several groups in the Federal Republic of Germany joined the global research efforts to gain deeper insights into this field. This research is dominated by attempts to identify and analyse immune responses that are host-protective or parasiteinhibitory and to isolate and produce target antigens of such responses.J. Langhorne and co-workers (Freiburg) are studying the immune response to Plasmodium shown that cyclosporin A has a suppressive effect on infection with Leishmania major by inhibiting the expansion of CD4 + T cells, thereby reducing the production of tymphokines such as granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-3, which are involved in the expansion of monocytes and macrophages that form the cellular basis of cutaneous !esions induced by L. major 3. In addition, this drug enhances the elimination of the intracellular parasites by macrophages 4. These observations are supported by ~he demonstration that recombinant GM-CSF has a detrimental effe~ on the course of the infection in BALB/c mice s.

T cells with chara:eristics not only of 1\"81 and TH2 subtypes, but also of an intermediate type, have been cloned from BALB/c mice infected with L. major; this suggests $37Immunology Today, VoL 10, No. 8, 1989 Supplement $38 that a critical balance of these functionally different T cells is required to overcome the infection. Furthermore. TH2 cells specific for L. major have been shown to be responsible .or the polyclonal B-ceil stimulation and hypergammaglobulinemia that is typically found in chronic infections with L. major 6. Recently H. Moll joined this group and is studying the T-cell immune response to the purified lipophosphoglycan of L. major.D. Russell ~T~bingen) also works with Leishmania. He has purified the abundant promastigote surface antigen gp63 and the lipophosphoglycan from L. rnexicana and rec~nst6 tuted them into liposomes. These liposomes act as a potent vaccine: in CBA and BALB/c mice they induce appreciable levels of protection 7.M.L. Lohmann-Matthes and colleagues (Hannover), who study macrophages and their effects, have recently shown that macrophages and their non-phagocytic precursors can lyse L. donovani parasites extracellularly. She proposes that this spontaneous leishmanicidal activity may be of particular importance in the early phase of infection with Leishmania 8.R. Williams and D. Dobbeleare (Karlsruhe) study lymphocytes transformed by Theileria parva. They have analysed the control of expression of genes related to T-cell proliferation, which are expressed while the cell is infected with the parasite, and have provided evidence that IL-2 and its receptor are constitutively expressed in cells infected by Theileria 9.The immunology of schistosomiasis is studied by A.

Nowadays several bacterial infections are well controlled-some of them as a result of immunological studies. Interest in antibacterial immunity remains high, especially as several infections still cause major health problems because of their intimate relationship with the immune system.Several groups are now trying to define the relevant epitopes of bacterial components using synthetic peptides and/or mAbs in an attempt to develop diagnostic and therapeutic reagents. D. Bitter-Suermann, M.

Kaufmann's group in UIm. The activation of antibacterial and antifungal macrophage effector mechanisms by interleukins is being studied using murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages as a defined cell population (summarized in Ref. 22) . They have shown that in addition to interleukin-producing CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells with cytolytic activity are also involved in protection against intracellular bacteria (reviewed in Ref. 23 ). These findings !ed to the concept that cytolytic CD8 + T cells may contribute to host resistance by releasing bacteria from their niches within host cells that are unable to destroy their intracellular parasites. In this way, more potent phagocytes could eliminate the pathogens. At the same time, lysis of host cells by CD8 + T cells could be detrimental to the host since it allows microbial dissemination and leads to tissue destruction. Another Immunology Today, VoL 10, No. 8, 1989Supplement f t resproject of this group is the characterization of mycobacterial T-cell anti-9ens of potential value for vaccine design against leprosy and tuberculosis. One of the major T-cell antigens, the 65 kDa protein, is a heat shock protein which is highly conserved (for summary see Ref. 24 ). T cells specific for this molecule recognize epitopes shared by various microbes, and could therefore participate in cross-immunity to different pathogens 2s. On the other hand, some T cells are directed to epitopes shared by the bacterial and human 65 kDa protein, and could be responsible for certain autoimmune sequelae of bacterial infections (reviewed in Ref. 25 ).An understanding of how viruses Immunity to viruses ! and their hosts interact can be reached only by an interdisciplinary approach. Without considering the immune response of the host, the virologist cannot explain viral pathogenesis, and by viewing viruses as passive protein antigens, the immunologist cannot explain the immune response to infection, This brief overview on viral immunology in the Federal Republic of Germany cannot do justice to all who work in this field and -rather than reviewing merits of the 2ast -it will focus on current basic research that is aimed at answering open questions about the mechanisms of protective immunity and immunopathology in viral infections. choriomeningitis (LCM) virus infection.

A division within the CD8 subset of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity and antiviral activity is also indicated by findings with the mutant mouse strain BALB/c H-2 drn2, in which the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) L region is deleted. This mutant, in contrast to BALB/c mice, does not generate a significant LCM virus-specific CTI response in vitro; this must be taken to mean that in the MHC d haplotype most LCM virus-specific CTL recognize viral antigens presented by the L d molecule.

To explain this, Lehmann-Grube postulates that an antiviral cytokine blocks viral replicatlon in already infected cells and is released or induced by antiviral effector cells.

But whatever the final answer, Lehmann-Grube has drawn attention to a paradox.Another current research interes~ of this group is the role of the local LCM virus-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction in viral clearance 2.

Supporting the assumption that the underly;ng effector mechanism is the same in EAE and virusinduced SAE, MHC class-ll-resericted CD4 + T-cell lines specific for rat MBP could be isolated from susceptible Lewis rats during SAE induced by infection with corona or measles virus, whereas in the resista~,t Brown Norway strain, SAC does no' develop and no MBP-specific T-lymphocyte response is generated. As was the case for EAE, MBP-specific lines isolated from SAE rats proved to be encephalitogenic when infused into naive recipients s. In contrast, measles-virus-specific CD4 + T-cell lines derived from the same donors were neither encephalitogenic, nor could they be restimulated in vitro with rat MBP. The conclusion that measles virus epitopes do not mimic the complete encephalitogenic epitope of rat MBP is supported by the fact that amino acid sequences analogous to the encephalitogenic site in rat MBP are not encoded by the measles virus genome. The mechanism by which the infection aids the generation of self (MBP)-reactive T lymphocytes is not finally resolved. Besides interesting speculations ihat cannot all be discussed here, evidence is provided by V. ter Meulen and his co-authors for an induction by corona as well as by measles virus of MHC c!ass II glycoprotein expression on astrocytes 6-8, which, in the case of measles virus, can be amplified synergistically by tumor necrosis factor s. Such a mechar~ism can make astrocytes ccmpeter, t to present MBP peptides to MHC class-II-restricted MBP-specific =lones.R. Rott and his group (Giessen) have contributed to viral immunology by recent work on the pathogenesis of Borna disease, a progressive encephalomyelitis of horses and sheep that can also be studied in the Lewis rat model 9.1o. An immunopathogenetic mechanism in Boma disease was already indicated by the finding that manifestations of disease are absent in immunodeficient newborn or athymic rats and after immunosuppression, despite persistent replication of Borna disease virus (BDV) in astrocytes. So far, BDV is only partially characterized. Borna disease.could be evoked in persistently infected immunosuppressed recipient~ by transfer of an MHC class-II-restricted CD4 + T lymphocyte line directed against a BDV-specific protein. Thus, unlike the examples cited above, Borna disease is not a virus-induced autoimmune disease, but is an example ol an immunopathology based on expression of viral antigens. This conclusion is supported by the finding that the BDV-specific line is not encephalitogenic in noninfected recipients, while this is a characteristic of the MBP-specific lines in EAE or virus-induced SAE.",

In contrast, after immunosuppression, lymphohematogenous spread of virus results in generalized infection, encephalitis and death 11.

This work led to the identification of the minimal antigenic sequence in an immunodominant viral protein. Gene expression in herpes viruses is temporally f~LJU~=,~u' d =n\" three phases: the immediate-early, the early and the late phase. Within the 235 kilobase pairs of the DNA genome of murine CMV, immediate eariy proteins are encoded in a region of approximately 12 kilobase pairs. In the acut~ immune response of BALB/c mice to local infection, almost half of all CTL in a draining lymph node are directed against antigens specified in this region 16. The regulatory phosphoprotein pp89, which is encoded by the immediate early gene iel, serves as an antigen for polyclonal CTI., and the recombinant vaccinia virus MCMViel-VAC protects mice against lethal challenge infection ~7. Deletion mutagenesis of ie~ located the antigenic site within the 595 amino acids of pp89 in a region of 95 amino acids ~8. The nonapeptide YPHFMPTNL (one-letter code), presented by the MHC class I molecule Ld0 was identified as the optimal antigenic peptide for the pp89specific CTL clone IE1 (CD8, TCR ~dV~6). With the sequence HFMPT, this nonapeptide contains an antigenic motif predicted by J.B. Rothbard (London). The demonstration of a direct antigenicity of the peniapeptide HFMPT has added a new aspect to the current understanding of the MHC molecule-peptide-TCR interaction ~ 9.Research on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a somewhat delayed start in West Gern~any, similar to the time lag of about two years for the start of the German AIDS epidemic compared with the situation in the United States 1. Initial studies focused mainly on clinical disease manifestation, epidemiological studies, descriptions of immune dysfunctions in AIDS patients and the devc',opn,,~nt of methods for the diagnosis of AIDSrelated disease. More recently, detailed studies have begun on HIVrelated immune dysfunctions, pathogenetic mechanisms, biology ot the virus-host relationship and therapeutic vaccination approaches.",

This observation is suggested as a possible explanation for the failure of cellular immune response in HiVinfected patients.A. Ganser, D. Hoelzer and colleagues (University Frankfurt) found that hematopoietic progenitor cells were decreased in bone marrow and peripheral blood of patients with HIV-infection 28,29 which they propose is due to the inversion of CD4/ CD8 lymphocytic subpopulation ratio, while their response to nemopoietic stimulating factors is normal.The group of P.H.

Cultivated KS cells express endothelial cell markers as do their counterparts in the tumor, indicating that these cells have an endothelial origin 3o.31.

Motz and cotleagues work on identifying the Immunology Today, VoL 10, No. 8, 1989 Supplement immunorelevant epitopes of HIV using computer-assisted analysis. They identified the envelope protein with their antigenic epitopes and constant and variable regions within the amino acid sequence of various HIV-isolates and studied their role in the humoral and cellular immune response using synthetic oligopeptides 32. The macaque model for HIV vaccine and treatment trials is being studied by G. Hunsmann and co-workers (G6ttingen). Rhesus monkeys vaccinated with purified glycoproteins of simian immunodeficiency virus (S~V) develop high neutralizing antibody titers. Experiments to challenge these animals with pre-titrated SIV are planned 33. R. Kurth (Paul Ehrlich-Institut, Frankfurt) and colleagues have isolated, cloned and sequenced SIV from African green monkeys 34,3s.G. KOhler (MPI, Freiburg) is trying to clone anti-mouse CD4 antibody encoding genes to analyse transgenic mice carrying these genes for lack of CD4 + cells and their immune status. F. Emmrich's group (University Erlangen) have produced an antihuman CD4 monoclonal antibody that efficiently blocks both the binding of gp120 to CD4, and HIV infection in vitro. Using this antibody, a series of high affinity combining site associated anti-idiotypic (anti-id) antibodies were generated in syngeneic mice, but to date no internal image idiotype of CD4 that recognizes gp120 and blocks HIV infection has been obtained. G. RiethmCil!er's group is using a similar approach, but have not been successful in finding internal image antibodies either. A screening system for antiviral comoounds has been developed by H. RCibsamen-Waigmann and coworkers. With this system, pentosanpolysulfate (HOE/BAY 946) was shown to inhibit HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains with comparable efficiency in cell culture, and with very low toxicity. Furthermore, the substance was found to inhibit virus synthesis, and may have potential as a therapeutic agent in early stages of HIV infection to prevent development of AIDS 36. It was proposed by W. Dr6ge's group (DKFZ, Heidelberg) that reduced plasma cysteine (thiol) levels in HIV-infected patients are responsible for reduced lymphocyte and macrophage function 37 and they suggest N-acetyl-cysteine for treatment of HIV-1 infected patients.The focus of the research of M. Pawlita, H. zur Hausen and their colleagues (DKFZ, Heidelberg) is on inhibition of HIV expression arid ,eplication by using the molecular genetic principle of cloning and inducing 'anti sense' RNA for viral genes in HIV-infected cells.K.
