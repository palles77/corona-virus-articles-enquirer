Despite hardships such as poor working conditions, he quickly made great strides in the accumulation of medical knowledge, which lent him support in pursuing future progress. In 1972, the significant national burden of chronic bronchitis prompted the central government to establish The Group for Prevention and Management of Chronic Bronchitis, which in 1979 became Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease. In recognition of their achievement in investigating the effects of a Chinese herb on chronic bronchitis, Professor Zhong and colleagues were awarded the National Prize for scientific advances.",

The development of a corrected formula for calculating nutritional energy balance in critically ill patients has significantly improved patient health care in ICUs.

The establishment of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease has transformed his visions into an ideal platform for bridging the gap between basic scientific research and clinical practice. He has frequently stated that scientific research should be pursued for the improvement of people's well-being, which has led to copious landmark translational research that has dramatically changed the way medicine should be practiced. The study finding that carbocisteine effectively reduced the annual acute exacerbation rate of COPD was awarded \"Paper of the year 2008\" by The Lancet editorial Board. Recognizing challenges of COPD management in China, he and colleagues performed the largest epidemiologic investigation on the national disease burden, highlighting that approximately 36% of patients with COPD remained asymptomatic on presentation, that biomass fuel combustion might be the main risk factor for COPD in women (particularly in rural areas), and that simple practical approaches (eg, installation of exhaust fans and replacing biomass with biogas) may significantly ameliorate the rate of lung function decline and reduce the incidence of COPD. Recently, he designed the first multicenter clinical trial proving that early intervention in COPD (eg, with tiotropium inhalation) may effectively ameliorate the decline in lung function. His comments on improving air quality to reduce the burden on chronic respiratory diseases have inspired scientists and clinicians to dedicate themselves to the prevention and management of air pollution in China.",

His open mind, coupled with a laudable drive and physical fitness, have lent him measurable support to pursue further achievement, which will ultimately benefit people worldwide, making him a true Giant in Chest Medicine. Physicians and scientists worldwide can benefit considerably by standing on the shoulders of his work. We encourage all to view the interview of Professor Zhong's words of wisdom (Video 1).",
