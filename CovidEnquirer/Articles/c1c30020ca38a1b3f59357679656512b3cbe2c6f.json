In the present study, the complete genome sequence of Newbury1 was determined and classified Newbury1 in a new genus of the Caliciviridae. The Newbury1 genome, of 7454 nucleotides, had two predicted open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encoded the non-structural and contiguous capsid proteins. ORF2 encoded a basic protein characteristic of the family Caliciviridae. Compared to the 4 recognized Caliciviridae genera, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus and Vesivirus, Newbury1 had less than 39% amino acid (47% nucleotide) identity in the complete 2C-helicase, 3C-protease, 3D-polymerase and capsid regions but had 89% to 98% amino acid (78% to 92% nucleotide) identity to the recently characterized NB virus in these regions. By phylogenetic analyses, Newbury1 and NB viruses formed a distinct clade independent of the 4 recognized genera. However, amino acid identities showed that Newbury1 and the NB virus were distinct polymerase types (90% amino acid identity), but their complete capsid proteins were almost identical (98% amino acid identity). Analyses of contemporary viruses showed that the two polymerase genotypes, Newbury1 and NB, were circulating in UK cattle and antibody to Newbury1-like viruses was common in cattle sera. The present study defined the existence of a new genus in the Caliciviridae that we propose be named Becovirus or Nabovirus to distinguish the new clade from bovine noroviruses.",

            "text": "In experimental calves, Newbury1 was more pathogenic than the Newbury2 virus, causing fecal color change and increased fecal output, anorexia and xylose malabsorption . The most severe small intestinal lesions caused by Newbury1 infection were in the anterior small intestine where villi were atrophied with complete loss of enterocytes that exposed parts of the lamina propria . Virus particles were seen by electron microscopy in feces (Woode and Virology 350 (2006) 240 -250 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro Bridger, 1978) . Viral antigen was found in the cytoplasm of enterocytes in the anterior small intestine up to 3 days postinfection . All of these features were consistent with an enteropathogenic virus. The Newbury1 virion had several properties consistent with the Caliciviridae: a typical morphology showing cup-like depressions, a particle diameter of 36.6 nm, a buoyant density of 1.34 g/cm 3 in CsCl and a single capsid protein with a molecular mass of 49 kDa (Dastjerdi et al., 2000) . There are currently 4 genera recognized in the family Caliciviridae (Green et al., 2000) . Each one has been named after the disease symptom (vesicular lesions-Vesivirus), hosts infected (lagomorphs-Lagovirus) or the geographical location where the type species was first isolated (Sapporo, Japan-Sapovirus; Norwalk, USA-Norovirus). All of these small, non-enveloped, icosohedral viruses contain positive-sense, single-stranded, polyadenylated RNA genomes that range from 7.3 to 8.5 kbp in length flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (reviewed by Green et al., 2001) . The division of the caliciviruses into the 4 distinct genera has been based on differences in their genomic organization and extensive genomic sequence diversity of the polymerase and capsid genes that form 4 clades by phylogenetic analyses (reviewed by Green et al., 2000) . The genomes of the lagoviruses and sapoviruses are organized into two open reading frames (ORFs) whereas those of the noroviruses, into which Newbury2 has been classified, and the vesiviruses are organized into three. ORFs 1 and 2 of the noroviruses overlap but those of the vesiviruses are separated by a few nucleotides. In addition, the capsid proteins of the vesiviruses have a leader sequence that is proteolytically cleaved during maturation (Matsuura et al., 2000; Sosnovtsev et al., 1998) . In all the genera, the 3\u2032 terminal ORF, ORF2 for the sapoviruses and lagoviruses and ORF3 for the noroviruses and vesiviruses, overlap with the capsid gene (reviewed by Green et al., 2001) . The proteins encoded by the genome follow the order NH 2 -terminal, 2C-helicase, 3A, 3B, 3C-protease, 3D-polymerase, capsid and a basic protein (3\u2032 terminal ORF), which distinguished the Caliciviridae from other families of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The translated proteins of all the genera have at least one conserved amino acid motif for the 2C-helicase (GXXGXGKS/ T), 3C-protease (GDCG), 3D-polymerase (GLPSG, YGDD) and capsid (PPG) proteins.",

It had a 5\u2032 untranslated region of 75 nucleotides and a 3\u2032 untranslated region of 67 nucleotides flanking 2 ORFs (Table 1) . ORF1 was 6633 nucleotides (2210 amino acids) long, started from nucleotide 76 and was terminated by the ochre stop codon UAA. The short 3\u2032 terminal ORF (ORF2) was 678 nucleotides (225 amino acids) long. It did not overlap with ORF1 but was separated by a single nucleotide so that the gene was in a +2 frame-shift. The non-structural proteins (NH 2 -terminal, 2C-helicase, 3A, 3B, 3C-protease and 3D-polymerse) and the capsid protein were predicted to be encoded by ORF1 with a combined molecular mass predicted to be 239 kDa. The organization of the ORF1 polyprotein was determined by the presence of amino acid motifs (conserved amino acids underlined) for the 2C-helicase (GPPGHGKS), 3Cprotease (GYCG), 3D-polymerase (GLPSG and YGDD) and capsid (PPG) proteins. The observation that the 5\u2032 end of the Newbury1 genome had 12 nucleotides conserved within a 22nucleotide region of ORF1 (nucleotides 5036 to 5047) predicted a possible internal initiation codon ( 5059 ATG 5061 ) for the capsid gene that encoded a 58 kDa protein. A second possible initiation codon ( 5326 ATG 5328 ) was predicted to produce a 49 kDa capsid protein similar to that detected previously for Newbury1 by Western blot (Dastjerdi et al., 2000) . However, it is unknown, at present, if translation occurs from a subgenomic RNA.",

The dipeptides at the predicted cleavage sites consisted of E/ QG/A. Increased hydrophilicity of the polyprotein, as determined by the method of Kyte-Doolittle, corresponded with the position of the cleavage dipeptides. The predicted NH 2terminal, 2C-helicase and 3A cleavage products for the Newbury1 polyprotein contained both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic region. The predicted 3B cleavage product was exclusively hydrophilic with the 3C-protease predominantly neutral. Whether alternative cleavage sites exist is unknown at present. The capsid protein could be divided into 2 hydrophobic and a hydrophilic region that coincided with the S, P1 and P2 domains based on the crystal structure determined for the capsid protein of the Norwalk virus (Prasad et al., 1999) . In contrast to viruses in the 4 recognized Caliciviridae genera, cysteine, important for disulfide bridge formation, was not present in the capsid protein.

The highest amino acid identity (39%) was seen with the Lagovirus polymerase. The lowest amino acid identity (\u22649%) was seen with the 3\u2032 terminal ORF for the sapoviruses (ORF2) and vesiviruses (ORF3). In contrast, the entire Newbury1 ORF1 polyprotein had \u226589% amino acid (\u226578% nucleotide) identity compared to the previously characterized NB virus (Smiley et al., 2002) . Surprisingly, the least variation was seen between the P-domains of the capsid protein of the 2 viruses. Newbury1 failed to group phylogenetically with the 4 recognized Caliciviridae genera but formed a separate clade with NB virus by UPGMA, Fitch-Margoliash, parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of the nucleotide and translated amino acids of ORF1 (excluding the capsid gene), the individual regions that encoded the 2C-helicase, 3C-protease, 3D-polymerase and complete capsid genes (not shown). The NH 2 -terminal, 3A and 3B regions were not used for phylogenetic analyses because of the poor nucleotide and amino acid alignments caused by the extensive diversity in these sequences between the 4 calicivirus genera. Both Newbury1 and NB viruses consistently grouped more closely with the lagoviruses but the branch lengths were very long, indicative of evolutionary diverse viruses.",

Homology models are useful to compare sequences with low levels of identity, as observed in the present study. Newbury1 and NB were again phylogenetically closer to the lagoviruses in their polymerase sequences ( Fig. 3A ) but were more closely related to the noroviruses in their conserved capsid S-domain sequences (Fig. 3B) . However, the statistical support at the node between the Newbury1 and NB viruses and the noroviruses was weak (72%), indicating that this relationship was uncertain. The divergence of the Newbury1 and NB genomes from the other calicivirus genera was confirmed by higher mean values for maximum likelihood distances, a measure of evolutionary divergence for nucleotide or amino acid sequences. Newbury1 and NB had twice the nucleotide maximum-likelihood distances when compared to the 4 recognized calicivirus genera for the non-structural genes (x = 1.419; \u03c3 = 0.158) and the complete capsid genes (x = 1.377; \u03c3 = 0.214) than the means within each of the 4 genera (non-structural genes: Vesivirus-x = 0.726; \u03c3 = 0.323).

The genomic organization was typical of the calicivirus genera Lagovirus and Sapovirus, not the genera Norovirus or Vesivirus, as a single ORF encoded the non-structural (NH 2 -terminal, 2C-helicase, 3A, 3B, 3Cprotease, 3D-polymerase) and single major capsid protein (Green et al., 2001) . However, three significant differences in the Newbury1 genome organization distinguished it from the 4 recognized calicivirus genera. Firstly, the 5\u2032 UTR was at least 3 times longer than any other calicivirus. Secondly, ORF1 and ORF2 did not overlap but were separated by a single nucleotide. A similar separation between ORFs has been seen for the vesiviruses but between the non-structural and major capsid proteins (Glenn et al., 1999; Matsuura et al., 2002) . Thirdly, the 3C-protease had a GYCG motif that was identical to some members of the Picornaviridae (Carrillo et al., 2005; Doherty et al., 1999; Skern et al., 1985; Wutz et al., 1996) , but not the typical calicivirus GDCG motif. The Newbury1 ORF2 protein was at least 60 residues longer than those for the lagoviruses, sapoviruses and vesiviruses but was of a similar size to the analogous 3\u2032 terminal norovirus proteins (ORF3). All of these genomic features and the low levels of sequence identities, combined with phylogenetic analyses and the maximum likelihood distances, proved that Newbury1 was a calicivirus distinct from those of the 4 recognized genera of the Caliciviridae.",

            "text": "predicted molecular mass of 58 kDa for the Newbury1 and NB capsid proteins contrasted with the 49 kDa previously determined for Newbury1 by Western blot analysis (Dastjerdi et al., 2000) . The smaller mass might be due to cleavage of a precursor capsid protein, as described for the genus Vesivirus (Matsuura et al., 2000; Sosnovtsev et al., 1998) , or translation of a subgenomic RNA of the Newbury1 capsid gene at a predicted initiation codon located at nucleotide 5326 in the Newbury1 genome (5327 for the NB genome). The molecular mass of the NB capsid protein has not been reported. As the viruses have not been propagated in cell culture, in vitro molecular studies are required to determine the biologically active ORF1 polyprotein protease cleavage sites and translation of the capsid genes for this new calicivirus genus. The present study and one previous study demonstrated that Newbury1-like viruses are currently circulating in cattle on two continents (Smiley et al., 2003) . For the first time, the present study indicated that two polymerase, but not capsid, genotypes exist. It was unlikely that analysis of the NH 2terminal regions of the Newbury-like and NB-like viruses failed to recognize different capsid types as capsid genotypes within the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus can be distinguished by analysis of the conserved NH 2 -terminal region of the capsid protein (Kageyama et al., 2004; Okada et al., 2002) . It is uncertain whether both polymerase types exist in the USA as, to date, polymerase sequence data are available only for a single contemporary NB-like virus, Bo/CV23-OH/00/US. There are precedents within the genera Norovirus and Sapovirus for different polymerase genes being associated with similar capsid genes (Bull et al., 2005; Han et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 1999a; Katayama et al., 2004; Katayama et al., 2002; Lochridge and Hardy, 2003; Oliver et al., 2004) . This is thought to be due to genomic recombination. Further studies are required to examine the diversity of the caliciviruses within the new genus.",

            "text": "Our data has substantially advanced the knowledge about caliciviruses that cause diarrhea in cattle. Outbreaks of calf diarrhea cause significant economic losses in the UK (Stott and Gunn, 1995) . Enteropathogens are not identified for approximately 30% of calf diarrhea cases (Andrews, 2000; Reynolds et al., 1986; Snodgrass et al., 1986) , even though the presence of rotaviruses, coronaviruses, Cryptosporidia, Coccidia, Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli are sought. However, caliciviruses are not routinely tested for. In the present study, Newbury1-and NB-like viruses were found with similar frequency (8.4%) to the bovine noroviruses (Oliver et al., 2003; Smiley et al., 2003; van der Poel et al., 2003; Wise et al., 2004) although this was substantially lower than the frequency of 28% for NB-like viruses found in the USA (Smiley et al., 2003) . Hence, in the UK, our data indicate that caliciviruses (noroviruses and the caliciviruses in the new genus) are associated with about 17% of calf diarrhea cases, leaving about 13% of cases still undiagnosed. It seems likely that Newbury1-and NB-like viruses are responsible for a proportion of diarrhea in farm calves as Newbury1 and NB caused enteric disease after oral inoculation of experimental calves and produced small intestinal lesions typical of enteropathogenic viruses Hall et al., 1984; Smiley et al., 2002) . Further studies are required to assess the antigenic diversity of caliciviruses within the proposed new genus, their incidence and prevalence in calf diarrhea outbreaks, their species specificity and whether similar viruses exist in man.

For Newbury1, feces were available from two experimentally infected calves (1424 and 2010) (Dastjerdi et al., 2000) . Fecal samples from 107 diarrheic farm calves collected in 2000 from two geographically distant locations in the UK, Penrith (n = 57) and Starcross (n = 50), were kindly provided by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency. Sera from 18 cattle were collected from two herds; 8 were from mixed sexes of 6-month-old cattle at the Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Berkshire, UK in 1990 and 10 were from yearling female cattle collected in 1993 from Wiltshire, UK, kindly provided by Dr. Ian Thompson, Royal Veterinary College, UK. Amplification and sequence analysis of the Bo/Newbury1/ 1976/UK genome RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed as described previously (Oliver et al., 2003) . Reverse transcription was performed at 42\u00b0C using 200 IU of Moloney murine leukemia virus (H-) reverse transcriptase (Promega). The PCR primers used to initially amplify Newbury1 were those designed to anneal with viruses in the family Caliciviridae BoCVpol001 (5\u2032-ATCAAGGAGCACG-TGGTGGAG-3\u2032)/YGDD , 290/289 (Jiang et al., 1999b) , NORO(F)/NORO(R) (Smiley et al., 2003) or the NB-like viruses NBU(F)/NB(R) (Smiley et al., 2003) . To generate amplicons that spanned the entire Newbury1 genome, PCR was performed with HotStar Taq (Qiagen) using primers partly based on Newbury1 sequence and the NB virus (Smiley et al., 2002) that overlapped the entire length of the Newbury1 genome. An initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, then, dependant on the primer pairs, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C for 30 to 60 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 to 2 min were performed, with final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplicons from 0.2 to 1.7-kbp in length were generated and gel purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Purified amplicons were cloned using a TOPO-TA pCR2.1 cloning kit (Invitrogen Ltd.). Nucleotide sequencing of 3 to 5 clones for each PCR amplicon from Newbury1 was performed by MRCgeneservice, Hinxton, UK. The consensus nucleotide sequence of Newbury1 was prepared using the STADEN sequencing package (Staden et al., 2000) . ORFs were predicted using the NCBI ORF finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html). The GC content of the Newbury1 genome was calculated, the molecular masses and isoelectric points of proteins were predicted and hydropathy plots were generated using the bioinformatics software Jemboss (Carver and Bleasby, 2003) .",

TreePuzzle 5.2 was used for additional maximum likelihood with quartet puzzling analyses (Schmidt et al., 2002) . In addition, phylogenetic analyses were performed using amino acid alignments generated from homology models of the polymerase and the S-domain of the capsid protein. This was done to compensate for the high diversity between Newbury1 and the 4 Caliciviridae genera; amino acid alignments were generated based on the 3Dstructure of the polymerase and the S-domain of the capsid. Homology models of the polymerase and S-domain of the capsid were generated using the Swiss-model server (http:// swissmodel.expasy.org//SWISS-MODEL.html). Amino acids sequences for the 17 caliciviruses plus Newbury1 were aligned by eye using the homology model alignments for the conserved regions of the polymerase and the S-domain of the capsid protein. Phylogenetic trees were prepared by using TreeView (Page, 1996) and edited for clarity with Microsoft Word. To determine the evolutionary divergence of the calicivirus genome sequences, maximum likelihood distances were calculated using TreePuzzle 5.2.",
