Snails become infected with a different type of larva that hatches from eggs excreted in human faeces or urine into fresh water. Approximately 200 million persons in South America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East, People's Republic of China, Southeast Asia, and the Philippines suffer from schistosomiasis.
