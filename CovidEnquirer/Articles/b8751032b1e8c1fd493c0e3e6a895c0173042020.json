First, countries often insist on maintaining their sovereignty in matters of health. As a result, governments may fail to adhere to international health norms or cooperate with international agencies such as WHO. Second, most international public-health law is concerned with horizontal governance-ie, the regulation of travel and trade among sovereign nations. 2 Consequently, international law often entails border controls rather than globally established health rules that require, for example, strong national public-health capacities. Finally, the powerful high-income countries have inordinate influence on the global health agenda. Their concern is primarily to prevent movement of infections from the developing to the developed world rather than to alleviate endemic diseases in poorer regions such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. Powerful countries also have failed to provide the technical assistance and resources necessary to improve health in developing countries.",

The IHRs should stress the salience of global health and WHO's essential functions to achieve that purpose. WHO should dedicate itself to the protection and promotion of global health. Wherever possible, health rules should respect travel and trade, but assuring global health remains WHO's primary function.",

This narrow scope impedes WHO in effectively dealing with modern health threats ranging from HIV/AIDS to bioterrorism. The revised IHRs cover \"all events potentially constituting a public health emergency of international concern\". This new approach is preferable because it is flexible, future-oriented, and covers all hazards (radiological, chemical, and biological), whether naturally occurring, accidental, or intentional. WHO should continually specify the kinds of health conditions encompassed within this broad definition. Failure to do so could give member states an excuse not to report specific infectious diseases.",

Public notification of health threats can adversely affect a country's economy and prestige. It can trigger media coverage or travel advisories affecting trade and tourism, and adversely affect the reputation and electoral prospects of political leaders. Global surveillance can be substantially improved by effective vertical governance. First, WHO could establish criteria for uniform data sets, core informational requirements, and timely monitoring and reporting. These norms would help set a standard for national and global surveillance. Second, WHO should expand its data sources beyond official government channels. \"Smallworld networks\" consisting of scientists, health professionals, membership associations, and nongovernmental organisations could considerably broaden the sources of health information. Finally, WHO should use modern technology for surveillance including electronic health records and the internet to gather and analyse surveillance data. WHO is already beginning this process, which could be enhanced through the revised IHRs.",

As the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks demonstrated, prompt and efficient monitoring and response at the national level is critically important to prevent the proliferation of disease. 5 To improve national competencies, WHO should set minimum standards for laboratories, data systems, and response. By setting performance standards and measuring outcomes, WHO could continually help member states evaluate their public-health preparedness. Compliance with international health norms has been a serious problem. It is therefore important for WHO to adopt measures to enhance conformance with global health norms. This could be accomplished through a combination of hard and soft law: mediation, adjudication, and incentives. A related problem is that poor countries cannot, without help, meet minimum standards for publichealth preparedness. The international community, therefore, should substantially increase technical and financial assistance for health-system improvement in developing countries.",

Health measures may also be applied inequitably leading to discrimination against unpopular groups such as migrants and ethnic minorities.

His symptoms had begun with high-grade fever during the 3rd week of November followed by bloody diarrhoea, leg swelling, rectal prolapse, and decreased urine output. The child was treated as an outpatient by a local health-care provider with several doses each of co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, and pivmecillinam. Due to a progressive worsening in his clinical status, he was brought to ICDDR, B in Dhaka. Stool culture done at the ICDDR, B laboratory yielded S dysenteriae type 1, resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin. Because the patient's family reported dysenteric illness among other residents of the tea plantation estate, we conducted a field investigation in early December, 2003, to confirm the cluster of dysentery cases, determine the extent of the outbreak, and examine patterns of antimicrobial use by local health providers.",
