Despite its importance in interferonregulated antiviral innate immunity, relatively little is known about its precise mechanism of action. Here we present a functional characterization of 2.5 \u00c5 and 3.25 \u00c5 X-ray crystal and small-angle X-ray scattering structures of RNase L bound to a natural 2-5A activator with and without ADP or the nonhydrolysable ATP mimetic AMP-PNP. These studies reveal how recognition of 2-5A through interactions with the ankyrin repeat domain and the pseudokinase domain, together with nucleotide binding, imposes a rigid intertwined dimer configuration that is essential for RNase catalytic and antiviral functions. The involvement of the pseudokinase domain of RNase L in 2-5A sensing, nucleotide binding, dimerization, and ribonuclease functions highlights the evolutionary adaptability of the eukaryotic protein kinase fold.",

            "text": "In higher vertebrates, RNase L is a principal mediator of the interferon (IFN)-inducible antiviral state that can determine survival of animals infected with highly pathogenic viruses (Zhou et al., 1993 (Zhou et al., , 1997 . Virus-infected cells produce and secrete type I IFNs that bind to the cell-surface receptor, IFNAR, initiating JAK-STAT signaling to many IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), including 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS) genes (reviewed in Kristiansen et al. [2011] ; Stark et al. [1998] ). OAS1-3 proteins are pathogen recognition receptors for the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern, double-stranded (ds) RNA (reviewed in Silverman [2007] ). Once activated by viral dsRNA, OAS uses ATP to synthesize a series of 2-5A molecules consisting of p 3 A(2 0 p5 0 A) n , n R 2 (Kerr and Brown, 1978) . The only wellestablished function of 2-5A is to activate RNase L. 2-5A binds to monomeric, inactive RNase L, causing it to dimerize into its active state and resulting in cleavage of single-stranded viral and cellular RNA, principally after UpU and UpA dinucleotides (Floyd-Smith et al., 1981; Wreschner et al., 1981) . The triadenylate form of 2-5A is the minimal active species; however, longer 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylates, such as the tetraadenylate, retain the ability to activate RNase L (Dong et al., 1994) . Naturally occurring species of 2-5A contain three phosphoryl groups on the 5 0 -OH (Kerr and Brown, 1978) , although 5 0 -monophosphorylated 2-5A is capable of activating human RNase L in vitro (Dong et al., 1994) . RNase L contains, from its N to its C termini, an ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain, a pseudo-protein kinase (PK) domain lacking catalytic function (Dong and Silverman, 1999) , and a ribonuclease (RNase) domain, the latter two of which form a fused module homologous to the dual kinase-ribonuclease enzyme IRE1, a key effector of the unfolded protein response pathway (Walter and Ron, 2011) .",

Subsequent analysis of the complete ANK domain revealed how concerted binding of 2-5A to two ANK domains can mediate dimerization (Han et al., 2012) . Whether the PK and RNase domains also participate in 2-5A recognition and how 2-5A induces dimerization of the ANK domain imposing a specific dimer configuration on other regions of RNase L remained open questions. The function of the pseudo-PK domain has remained largely uncharacterized, but early studies indicated a possible role for ADP or ATP binding in enzyme stabilization or activation (Dong et al., 1994; Wreschner et al., 1982) . In addition, a K392R mutation in the kinase ATP binding site of human RNase L (corresponding to residue 390 in porcine RNase L) resulted in greatly impaired RNase activity (Dong and Silverman, 1999) . Lastly, the RNase domain of RNase L shows sequence similarity to only the RNase domain of IRE1 (Korennykh et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008) , and by inference, RNase L was predicted to share a common catalytic mechanism regulated by the imposition of a precise dimer configuration (Lee et al., 2008) .",

As observed in the isolated ANK domain crystal structures of human RNase L (Han et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2004) , the ANK domain of porcine RNase L adopts a crescentshaped structure consisting of a stack of nine ankyrin repeats ( Figure 1B ), each possessing a characteristic loop-helix1-loop-helix2-loop architecture.

Positioned between b strand nine and helix aF (as shown for PKA in Figure 2B ) are the expected positions of the activation segment, helix aEF and the helix aEF-aF connecting loop, elements which serve phospho-regulatory and phosphoacceptor recognition functions in prototypical protein kinases (Nolen et al., 2004) . In the RNase L structure, this entire region is absent and substituted by a four-residue shunt, whose structure enables a nonstandard position of a split helix aG, an element also normally implicated in PK substrate recognition (Brennan et al., 2011; Dar et al., 2005) . Other distinguishing features of the PK C-lobe include uncommon substitutions at PK conserved positions Gln484, Gln481, and Asp502 (Lys, Arg, and Gly residues in IRE1, respectively) ( Figure 2C ). Together, these unconventional features of the kinase C-lobe likely account for the incompetence of RNase L as a PK enzyme (Dong and Silverman, 1999) . However, suggesting a critical role for nucleotide binding in the overall biological function of RNase L, a fully ordered AMP-PNP molecule is found coordinated by a full complement of PK invariant residues, namely, Asp482 (catalytic base), Asn487 (Mg 2+ coordination), Asp500 (Mg 2+ coordination), Lys390 (phosphate coordination), Glu402 (salt contact with Lys390), and Ala388 (contact with adenine base), within the kinase interlobe cleft ( Figure 2C ). The uncommon substitution of Gly for Asp at position 502 is notable for contributing additional interactions to a magnesium ion, which tethers the g-phosphate of AMP-PNP ( Figure 2C ). The binding of AMP-PNP gives rise to a rigid closed conformation of the PK domain, as evidenced by intact catalytic and regulatory spines ( Figure 2D ), features reflective of the active state of protein kinases (Kornev et al., 2008) . The absence of nucleotide in the AMP-PNP-free structure notably disrupts the integrity of the catalytic spine and leaves the kinase C-lobe relatively untethered from the N-lobe.",

Centered on helix a4 of each protomer at the base of a deep cleft formed by the dimerization of two RNase domains lies the ribonuclease active site with two copies composed in cis of an invariant tetrad consisting of Tyr663, Arg 675, Asn676, and His680 side chains and the conserved basic side chain of Lys672. Consistent with a shared catalytic mechanism for phosphodiester bond cleavage inferred originally from comparisons to tRNA ribonuclease (Lee et al., 2008; Xue et al., 2006) , the catalytic residues of RNase L adopt conformations and placements highly similar to those adopted by the corresponding residues of IRE1 ( Figure 1C ). In contrast, residues composing the surrounding solvent-exposed surface are completely divergent across paralogues with RNase L also possessing a unique helical insert (helix a1 0 ) lining the outermost edge of the catalytic cleft.

Engagement of these two surfaces is coordinated by the rigidly fused junction between the PK C-lobe and the RNase domain arising from a contiguous hydrophobic core ( Figure S4A ), and by the binding of AMP-PNP to the pseudo-PK active site, which is predicted to constrain the inherent interlobe flexibility of the PK domain to a single closed conformation (Masterson et al., 2011) . Although only 3 (Tyr419, Arg675, and His680) of 27 back-to-back dimer contact residues on each protomer are conserved across paralogues ( Figure S2 ), the back-to-back dimer configuration of RNase L is highly similar (difference of 25 ) to that adopted by yeast IRE1 ( Figure S4A ). Back-to-back dimer contacts are primarily polar in nature and include a reciprocal salt bridge between Glu383 and Arg410 in the kinase N-lobes and between Lys603 and Glu683 and between Arg675 and Glu679 in the RNase domains ( Figure 3A , insets).

The channel mouth oriented inward to a large internal cavity between RNase L protomers engages the triphosphate moieties of Adenine 1 ( Figure 4B ), while the channel mouth oriented outward to solvent accommodates the untethered end of activators of length greater than three adenine residues ( Figure 4A ). Remarkably, within the tight confine of the channel center, virtually every functional group of 2-5A is engaged in molecular interactions with RNase L. Contacts with the two ANK domains bury 711 \u00c5 2 of the 1,167 \u00c5 2 total surface area of 2-5A and are similar overall to the contacts uncovered for a synthetic, monophosphate 2-5A analog in isolated ANK domain structures (Han et al., 2012; Tanaka et al., 2004) . Subtle differences in binding mode include a flip of the Adenine 3 base ( Figure S5 ) and the repositioning of the ANK Arg308 side chain to capture a pi-stacking interaction with PK Trp352 to form a clamp around the Adenine 3 ribose ring ( Figure 4A ). ANK repeats 1-6 of one protomer make extensive (SA = 529 \u00c5 2 ) contact with the back side of all three adenine residues while ANK repeat nine of the second protomer makes focused contacts (SA = 182 \u00c5 2 ) with the phosphate, sugar, and base of Adenine 3. Novel PK domain contacts covering 156 \u00c5 2 of 2-5A are mediated primarily by L2 of the PK N-lobe appendage, with the b and g phosphates of Adenosine 1 coordinated by a bifurcated salt interaction with the Lys164 side chain, which in turn is coordinated by a salt interaction with Asp424 in the b4-b5 linker of the PK domain (the latter is visible in Figure 3B ). Lastly, the phosphate moiety linking Adenine 1 and Adenine 2 is coordinated by a salt interaction with Arg353 in the PK N-lobe appendage and by van der Waals contacts with adjacent Pro354, Ile363, and Phe362 side chains.",

            "text": "Analyses of RNase L To probe the functional interplay between ANK, PK, and RNase domains and the importance of specific contacts, we pursued functional analyses of wild-type (WT) RNase L and a comprehensive panel of structure guided mutants (Figures 5, S6, and S7 ). We first investigated the effect of ligand binding on the oligomerization status of WT enzyme in solution using velocity analytical ultracentrifugation ( Figure S6A ). RNase L alone and in the presence of AMP-PNP was a monomer over the 0.5-10 mM protein concentration range tested. In the presence of 2-5A activator alone or with both 2-5A and AMP-PNP, RNase L was a dimer. These results with porcine RNase L are consistent with the behavior of human RNase L (Cole et al., 1997) . Using fluorescein-labeled RNase L, which enabled AUC analyses at nanomolar protein concentrations, we observed that AMP-PNP had no significant effect on the ability of RNase L to dimerize when already bound to 2-5A ( Figure S6B ). Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with biotin-labeled 2-5A immobilized onto streptavidin sensor chips, we assessed the relative binding affinity of full-length versus an ANK domainonly fragment of RNase L. Consistent with the PK domain contributing direct contacts to 2-5A, full-length RNase L bound to 2-5A with $7-fold higher affinity than the isolated ANK domain (57 \u00b1 16 nM versus 376 \u00b1 10 nM, respectively) ( Figure 5A ). In the case of full-length RNase L, the presence of ATP had no significant effect on the ability to bind 2-5A ( Figures 5A and S7A ). We next assessed the effect of ligand binding on the RNase activity of WT enzyme at 1.6 nM concentration. In the absence of both or either of 2-5A and nucleotide ligand, no RNase activity was detected, whereas in the presence of both ligands robust RNase activity was observed ( Figure 5B ). We attribute the unanticipated strict dependency of RNase L RNase function on nucleotide (Dong et al., 1994; Wreschner et al., 1982) to the purity of our protein preparations (see Experimental Procedures). We also investigated the ability of RNase L to discriminate between nucleotides, since the RNase function of yeast IRE1 responds more potently to ADP than to ATP (Sidrauski and Walter, 1997) . We found that ATP, ADP, and, to a slight lesser degree, the nonhydrolysable analog AMP-PNP all potentiated RNase function ( Figure 5B ). Consistent with these observations, mutation of ATP-coordinating residues in RNase L that markedly reduced nucleotide binding ( Figure 5C ) also caused a major impairment to RNase enzyme function ( Figure 5D ). This impairment could be partially offset for some mutants by higher nucleotide concentration ( Figure S7B ). Consistent with the corollary finding, we observed that 2-5A did not potentiate RNase L binding to nucleotide ( Figure S7C ).",

Notably, these adverse effects were comparable to the loss of function displayed by the RNase catalytic tetrad mutant His680Ala ( Figure 5F ). Similarly, mutation of the sole cis interaction site between ANK and PK domains (Arg308Ala or Trp352Ala) caused great to intermediate loss of RNase function, respectively ( Figure 5G ). The difference in severity for the two mutations may in part reflect the different roles that each position also plays in directly contacting 2-5A (Figure 4) . Disruption of the ANK domain-PK domain interaction in trans by the single charge reversal substitutions Asp158Lys or Lys368Asp, by the double substitution Asp158Lys/Lys368Asp, or by deletion of helix aAR8 0 (D156-166) also potently dimin-ished RNase activity ( Figure 5G ). Lastly, Tyr310Ala, Lys164Glu, and Arg353Glu mutations affecting 2-5A contacts with each of the two ANK domains, and the PK domain, respectively, also perturbed RNase function ( Figure 5H ). Since all RNase L mutants tested appeared properly folded as assessed by elution volume during purification by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown), these in vitro functional studies support the notion that the dimer configuration visualized in a crystal environment reflects a functionally relevant form of RNase L in solution.",

WT or mutant forms of porcine RNase L were transfected into HeLa-M cells for 24 hr prior to transfecting with the synthetic double-stranded RNA, poly(rI):poly(rC) (pIC), for an additional 3 hr. When introduced into cells, pIC activates OAS, causing production and accumulation of 2-5A, and activation of RNase L (Zhao et al., 2012) . To monitor RNase L activity in intact cells, total cellular RNA was isolated and separated on RNA chips (Agilent) (Xiang et al., 2003) (Figures 6A and 6B, upper panels) . The rRNA remained intact in control HeLa-M cells transfected with empty vector following by pIC ( Figures 6A and 6B, lane 1) . In contrast, WT porcine RNase L expressed in HeLa-M cells was strongly activated in response to pIC as determined by monitoring highly specific and characteristic discrete cleavage products of 28S and 18S rRNA from ribosomes (Silverman et al., 1983 ) ( Figures  6A and 6B , compare lanes 2 and 3 without and with pIC, respectively). Mutant RNase L lacking residues 156-166, an ANK segment interacting with both 2-5A and the PK domain, lacked ribonuclease activity ( Figure 6A, lane 4) . The Lys164Glu mutation of the binding site for natural 2-5A (through its b and g phosphoryl groups), showed reduced ribonuclease activity ( Figure 6A , lane 5). Mutant Tyr310Ala in the ANK 2-5A binding site was inactive, consistent with a prior report (Han et al., 2012) (Figure 6A , lane 6). Arg410Glu in the PK:PK interface was also defective for ribonuclease activity ( Figure 6A, lane 7) . Lys603Glu in the RNase:RNase interface had reduced activity ( Figure 6A , lane 8). RNase domain mutants Lys672Ala, Arg675Glu, and Glu679Arg were all defective ( Figure 6A, lanes 9-11) . ANK mutation Asp158Lys, a residue that forms a salt bridge to Lys368 in the PK domain, had reduced activity, whereas ribonuclease activity in the double compensatory mutant Asp158Lys-Lys368-Glu, that regenerates the salt bridge, was partially restored ( Figure 6A, lanes 12 and 13) . The latter result supports the functionality of the ANK:PK domain interface, although a partial recovery of function was not observed for a similar Asp158Lys-Lys368Asp mutant in our in vitro analysis. Five mutations in the ATP binding site of the PK domain were also evaluated for ribonuclease activity in intact cells ( Figure 6B ). Mutants Ala388Phe, Asp482Ala, Asn487Ala, Asp500Ala and to a lesser degree Glu402Ala all showed reduced activity ( Figure 6B, lanes 4-8) . Expression of the WT and the various mutant forms of porcine RNase L in HeLa-M cells occurred at similar levels as determined in western blots ( Figures 6A and 6B, lower panels) .",

The Rg and Dmax derived for the scattering data for RNase L bound to 2-5A was consistent with those expected from the crystal structure (see Table S1 for data collection parameters). The SAXS envelope resulting from ten independently generated ab initio models resulted in an elongated envelope with two distinct volumes. Superimposition of the crystal structure of RNase L onto this envelope using the supcomb program revealed that the ankyrin repeat domains and kinase N-lobes readily fit in the larger volume of the envelope and that the kinase C-lobes and RNase domains fit in the smaller volume ( Figure 7A ) (Kozin and Svergun, 2001) . In good agreement, the Porod-calculated molecular weight (195 kDa) is consistent with RNase L existing as a dimer in solution. We then collected SAXS data for RNase L bound to 2-5A in the presence of ADP and found the sample had smaller Rg and Dmax values (Table S1 ). The averaged SAXS envelope for this sample was also elongated but smaller in overall volume. Superimposition of the X-ray crystal structure of RNase L onto this envelope revealed a tightening of volume along the dimerization axis most pronounced in the region corresponding to the kinase C-lobe and RNase domains. These results are consistent with ADP causing a restriction of motion between the two protein kinase lobes.",

In response to the binding of 2-5A ligands to composite binding channels involving two ANK domains and one PK domain and to the binding of nucleotide to the PK active site, full-length RNase L dimerizes into a single rigid body that juxtaposes the two dual PK domain-RNase domain modules in a parallel back-to-back configuration.

See also Table S1. domain, IRE1 possesses an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident luminal domain, which allows it to sense the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins. The detection of misfolded protein transitions the ER luminal domain from low (n = 1 or 2) to high (n R 2) stoichiometric oligomers (Credle et al., 2005; Kimata et al., 2007) . Unlike RNase L, the dual PK-RNase domain module of IRE1 plays no role in the direct sensing of upstream-activating stimuli, and indeed the sensor and catalytic halves of IRE1 reside in separate organelle compartments, a feature which necessitates a less direct and precise mechanism for propagating dimerization/oligomerization signals. Lastly, the ability of the PK domain of RNase L to participate in stimuli sensing is supported by the evolution of a unique N-terminal lobe appendage not present in IRE1.",

RNase L, in contrast, lacks both the infrastructure to support phosphotransfer function and also the infrastructure (namely an activation segment harboring phosphoacceptor sites) to respond to autophosphorylation. In this respect, RNase L appears to have de-evolved to a structure akin to that of primitive atypical protein kinases such as Rio1 and Bud32 (Laronde-Leblanc et al., 2005; Mao et al., 2008) , which are similarly lacking in canonical C-lobe features. Despite a loss of phosphotransfer function, the ATP binding function of RNase L, like that of IRE1, is preserved, enabling the enforcement of a closed conformation of the PK domain required to assemble a dimeric and functional RNase module (Lee et al., 2008) .

Since total cellular ATP/ADP levels are generally high (3-5 mM) relative to the high affinity of RNase L for ATP (0.6-1.2 mM), and are tightly regulated to remain constant, they would be constitutively available for binding to the PK domain of RNase L. These properties likely account for our observation that some ATP binding site mutants of RNase L that display near-complete impairment of RNase function in vitro at low ATP concentration display significant residual function in cells. It is thus likely that the RNase function of RNase L is regulated primarily by 2-5A levels.

            "text": "Prior studies have shown that RNase L is a potent inhibitor of viral infections that can be essential for controlling viral pathogenesis, for instance as shown for viral hepatitis caused by a murine coronavirus, MHV (Zhao et al., 2012) . While a number of different RNA and DNA viruses are susceptible to RNase L (reviewed in Silverman [2007] ), some viruses have acquired or evolved genes that antagonize the OAS-RNase L pathway at different levels, including preventing OAS activation by sequestering dsRNA (Xiang et al., 2002) , degrading 2-5A (Zhang et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012) , or directly inhibiting RNase L (Sorgeloos et al., 2013; Townsend et al., 2008) . Viral antagonism of the OAS-RNase L pathway emphasizes the threat to the virus imposed by RNase L. Activation of RNase L also has profound effects on the cell by regulating innate immune signaling (Malathi et al., 2007) , autophagy (Chakrabarti et al., 2012; Siddiqui and Malathi, 2012) , and apoptosis (Castelli et al., 1997 (Castelli et al., , 1998 Zhou et al., 1997) . In addition, some human genetic studies have suggested that RNase L gene variants influence risk for different types of cancer, including hereditary prostate cancer (Carpten et al., 2002) , hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Kr\u00fc ger et al., 2005) , and breast cancer (Madsen et al., 2008) . A better understanding of RNase L activation at a molecular level may provide insight into these different facets of RNase L biology. Indeed, in these studies we show that the PK-PK interface, RNase-RNase interface, and ANK and pseudo-PK domains that interact with 2-5A are all essential for the antiviral activity of RNase L.",
