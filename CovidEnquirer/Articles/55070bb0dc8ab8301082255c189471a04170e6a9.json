However, soyabean products improperly treated may lead to gastrointestinal adverse reactions characterised by alterations in gut morphology and physiology, diarrhoea and poor growth (review by Sissons, 1989; Lallb et al., 1993a) . Many factors including animal, dietary and environment as well as intestinal bacterial flora have been suspected in this food sensitivity. Adverse reactions may be related to major soyabean storage globulins, glycinin and P-conglycinin (Sissons, 1982) ) or usual antinutritional factors ( ANF) like protease inhibitors and lectins (review by Huisman and Jansman, 199 1) . However, even if these ANF were inactivated by steam heating, gut disturbances were still observed (Sissons, 1982) . Indeed, only specific treatments including hot-ethanol denaturation or enzymatic proteolysis appeared more satisfactory to improve calf performance .",

Each of the 96 wells received 5 ml of a given antigen solution ( 1 pg ml-'). After 10 min of incubation under vacuum, membranes were blocked with Tris-milk buffer (skim milk powder (5%) in Tris buffer (Tris 10 mM, NaCl 150 mM, pH 8.0) for 30 min. When SMP was the coating antigen, gelatin 2% (Sigma) in Tris buffer was used as the blocking solution. After washing in a Tris-Tween 20 buffer (0,5% Tween 20 (Sigma) in Tris buffer), membranes were replaced in the same position in the dot apparatus. Then, serial doubling dilutions of the plasma or mucosal secretion extracts in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 150 mM, pH 7.2) were added to each well. After 10 min of binding, membranes were washed in Tris-Tween 20 buffer. All the following steps were carried out in batches.",

This increase depended on the way soya products were treated as previously shown (review by Sissons, 1982) .

However, increases in specific IgG1 and IgA levels, as observed here, were the most obvious features in infants suffering from gluten intolerance (Kelly et al., 199 1) .

Recent studies suggested that antigens inducing IgGl response first also involved IgE response in a second time, depending on the antigen levels (Snapper et al., 1988; Armerding et al., 1993) . Specific IgE can be assayed using the anti-bovine IgE Mab developed by Thatcher and Gershwin ( 1988) . Such an IgE response was not evidenced here by peroxidase immunostaining, possibly because IgE levels were low (data not shown). But a contribution of IgE antibodies in the hypersensitivity to soyabean proteins has been shown by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in a limited number of calves (Barratt and Porter, 1979; Kilshaw and Sissons, 1979) . More direct evidence of individual IgE responses and allergen identification are currently under investigation using radiolabelled antibody probes.",

Thus, in calves, alterations of the villi could also result from a cellular hypersensitivity reaction.

The band of 30-32 kDa may correspond to the subunit of soyabean agglutinin (Yates and Sage, 1983) . The bands of 20-23 and 37-42 kDa were similar to glycinin acid and basic subunits, respectively (Nielsen, 1985) . These bands were only observed in calves fed HSF in both plasma and mucosal secretions. Other specific bands of 47-5 1,59-62 and 65568 kDa may correspond to the three subunits of ,& conglycinin (Winters et al., 1990) . They were detected in calves fed HSPI or HSF. Moreover, visual differences between groups were observed in the staining intensity of bands corresponding to glycinin and /?-conglycinin, suggesting that these proteins were the most antigenic components of soyabean proteins (Kilshaw and Sissons, 1979; Sissons, 1982) . Other non-identified bands were also recognised by plasma and mucus Abs from calves fed HSF or HSPI. In addition, bands below 15 kDa were recognised only by IgGl from the calves fed HSF, strongly suggesting that antigens of these MWs could also be part of the hypersensitivity reaction. A band of about 22 kDa was detected by IgG2 probing in the calves fed HSPI but it was not observed in the calves fed HSF. This may indicate that hydrolysis of proteins is responsible for the appearance of neo-epitopes. HSPI probably shares common epitopes with HSF, but these epitopes may not be deleterious since growth (Lalles et al., 1994) or gut myoelectric activity (La&s et al., 1993b) were near-normal with HSPI.",

Finally, experiments on specific IgE, interleukins and antigens/allergens may provide new lights on dietary hypersensitivity reactions in farm animals.",
