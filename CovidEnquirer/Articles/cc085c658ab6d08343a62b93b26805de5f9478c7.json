Methods: All of the dengue case data were obtained from the surveillance system of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and were analyzed by Pearson correlations, linear regression, and geographical information system (GIS)-based mapping. The impact of implementing airport fever screening was evaluated using the Student's t-test and two-way analysis of variance. Results: A total of 10 351 dengue cases, including 7.1% of imported cases were investigated between 1998 and 2007. The majority of indigenous dengue cases (98.5%) were significantly clustered in southern Taiwan; 62.9% occurred in the metropolitan areas. The seasonality of dengue cases showed a peak from September to November. Airport fever screening was successful in identifying 45% (244/542 ; 95% confidence interval 33.1-57.8%) of imported dengue cases with fever. However, no statistical difference was found regarding the impact on community transmission when comparing the presence and absence of airport fever screening. Conclusions: Our results show that airport fever screening had a positive effect on partially blocking the local transmission of imported dengue cases, while those undetected cases due to latent or asymptomatic infection would be the source of new dengue outbreaks each year. \u00df",

Local outbreaks usually start in the summer following the importation of dengue virus (DENV) strains, reach a peak in October and November, and then slow down and cease in the winter of each year. Therefore, dengue is listed as a quarantine agent at the international airports in Taiwan, and in 2003 active surveillance for dengue was integrated into the airport fever screening program to reduce the importation of DENV strains. An empirical investigation into the impact of this intervention has not been carried out to date. In this study, we evaluated the effect of this intervention on community transmission. The findings of this study will contribute towards our understanding of dengue epidemics in Taiwan and this information may be applied in other epidemic areas to develop effective control measures in the future.",

The association of indigenous cases and imported cases (R ID-IP ), as well as population density (R ID-PD ) and population numbers (R ID-PN ), were measured using the Pearson product moment correlations test (R < 0.3 was considered to show no statistical association) and/or the linear regression test. The effect of airport screening was analyzed by several methods including the Student's t-test, the positive predictive value, and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), assuming the number of imported cases as the independent variable, the number of indigenous cases as the dependent variable, and the implementation of airport screening during 2003-2007 and no airport screening during 1998-2002. (Table 1 ). For example, Table 1 The spatial heterogeneity of dengue cases and the various dominant serotypes in local outbreaks in Taiwan (Table 1 ). Figure 1 shows the monthly distribution of dengue cases during the study period. There was significant seasonal fluctuation of indigenous cases among epidemic and non-epidemic years ( Figure 1A) . A slight increase in the number of cases was seen in June, this peaked from September to November and then subsided gradually in December, and new cases ceased between January and April. Regarding the four seasons, i.e., winter (December-February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-November), the highest prevalence of DENV infection was seen between summer and autumn annually. By comparing the seasonality of imported cases to indigenous cases, the pattern appeared to be slightly shifted to the left, except in 2002 ( Figure 1B ). Figure 2 shows the heterogeneous distribution of the total number of 9616 indigenous and imported cases recorded in the GIS surveillance system from 1998 to 2007. The majority (98.5%; 9475/ 9616) of indigenous dengue cases were significantly clustered in southern Taiwan, which has a tropical climate, especially in metropolitan areas (62.9%; 6051/9616), whereas only sporadic cases occurred in northern Taiwan, which has a subtropical climate. Further analysis of the indigenous cases in the hot spot regions of southern (tropical) Taiwan showed a higher prevalence of dengue in the urbanized cities than in the neighboring urban areas (Table 1, Figure 2A) .

Dengue outbreaks were mainly clustered in southern (tropical) Taiwan, especially in the metropolitan areas. The heterogeneity of dengue incidence in time and geography might be attributed to the complexity of risk factors involved in the disease in Taiwan, including the interaction of ecological factors, such as mosquito vectors, human density, and climate. The mosquito vectors Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti coexist in tropical southern Taiwan. The multi-meal feeding vector, A. aegypti, is the main vector, often found among humans in urban dwellings. 5, 6 For example, the distribution of A. aegypti in densely populated Kaohsiung City was found to be wider than A. albopictus and appeared to be increasing, whereas this was not found in the nearby counties. 11 Also, a significant correlation was found between the number of dengue cases per week and the adult A. aegypti index obtained 5 weeks before the disease occurred, whereas no correlation was found between the number of cases and the adult A. albopictus index in the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas during 2004-2008. 11 In subtropical northern Taiwan, however, only A. albopictus has been found and only sporadic dengue cases have been recorded during the past decade. The weather in tropical Taiwan, with heavy rain, lasting high temperatures averaging 28 8C, and a moist environment (50-55% relative humidity), has been considered optimal for mosquitoes seeking their hosts, 12, 15 leading to DENV replication. [12] [13] [14] However, in winter, dry conditions, relatively low temperatures averaging 20 8C, and occasional drops in temperature to 10-18 8C, could be a bottleneck for virus survival, amplification, and transmission. 16, 17 In northern Taiwan with a subtropical climate, the rainfall is moderate and temperatures are relatively mild. 4, 5 We observed that the dominant DENV abated each winter (December to February) even in tropical Taiwan, with diverse serotypes causing subsequent epidemics in following years (Table 1) . This annual diversity in the dominant serotype and data from phylogenetic studies 7, 9, 10 indicate that dengue is not endemic in Taiwan.",

The urbanized Kaohsiung City was found to be the highest risk area, followed by nearby Kaohsiung County, Tainan City, Tainan County, and then Pingtung County ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ). Wu et al. 5 proposed that the utilization of incidence rates to assess the occurrence of dengue infections gave limited results. In this study, we assessed the dengue incidence rate based on the number of cases divided by the stratified population of each separate region, instead of dividing by the total population. This provided meaningful differences between subtropical and tropical zone regions in epidemic years, but the results were rather meaningless in nonepidemic years or other areas ( Table 1) .",

However, airport fever screening followed by laboratory confirmation by real-time RT-PCR 8 successfully identified approximately half, 45% (244/542), of imported dengue cases in the viremic stages on days 1-5 after onset of illness. Our results also indirectly demonstrate that about 55.0% (298/542) of imported cases were temporary, non-febrile, i.e., latent cases, undetected by airport fever screening, entering Taiwan with some risk of community transmission. We agree with the findings of a previous report 17 that 50-90% of dengue infection cases are asymptomatic, and therefore transmission of DENV into Taiwan via incoming travelers may be inevitable. Nevertheless, our findings that the total number of imported cases = 3.459 + 0.418 \u00c2 number of imported cases detected by fever screening (R 2 = 0.80, p < 0.05), and that the geographical heterogeneity was the number of indigenous cases \u00c0169.283 + 53.398 \u00c2 number of imported cases (R 2 = 0.61) during 2003-2007 when airport fever screening had been implemented, indicate that border screening might provide a guide to the total number of dengue imported cases and indirectly alert authorities of possible domestic outbreaks in southern Taiwan. The immediate quarantine of infectious cases could also help to block partial domestic transmission, reducing the risk to the population and the need for subsequent intervention, including vector control and medical care for patients. The efficacy of screening symptomatic passengers passing through Taiwan airports by NCIT was found to have a PPV = 30.5-62.6% when fever prevalence among passengers was <1%; this is similar to a previous report. 8, 18 However, the effect on mitigating community transmission in dengue epidemics was not significantly different between pre-2003 border control methods (filling out questionnaires) and post-2003 methods (fever screening). This limitation was attributed to latent dengue cases, resulting from asymptomatic infection and possibly other factors, such as passengers hiding their symptoms. 8, 18 All of these factors that could impair airport screening strategies should be considered when setting up border control measures to delay the pandemic progression of DENV.",
