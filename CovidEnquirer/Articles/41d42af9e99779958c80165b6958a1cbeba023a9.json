Briefly, 0.206 g of CdO, 1.05 g of DDPA, 7g of TOPO and 10.2 g of HDA were loaded in a 100 mL three-neck flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The threeneck flask was purged with Ar several times and then degassed under vacuum at 100 o C for 2 hours. In a separate 50 mL three-neck flask, an injection solution was prepared by mixing 0.36 g of Se and 10 mL of TOP and the same procedure was performed. After degassing of both solutions under vacuum at 100 o C for 2 hours, they were refilled with Ar. The former solution was heated to 300 o C with stirring until the solid became a transparent liquid and then the injection solution was rapidly injected into it. The solution temperature was then dropped to 270 o C. Different sizes of CdSe quantum dots can be obtained by varying the time for solution at high temperature. Subsequently, the flask was cooled to room temperature with a wet cloth, then in a water bath. The synthesized CdSe QD was collected by dissolution/precipitation technique using chloroform and acetone solvents., Next,100 mL of chloroform was added and 200 mL of acetone was poured to precipitate the product. The product was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 mins and then washed three times using chloroform and acetone. After drying the solvents using a rotary evaporator, CdSe QD was obtained and stored in the dark.",

The water-soluble MPA capped CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD were prepared from TOPO-capped CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD by ligand exchange method. This phenomenon was confirmed by the 1 H-NMR results (Fig. S1b) . In 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, the peak arising from the TOPO ligand at 1.64, 1.26 and 0.87 ppm disappeared in the 1 H-NMR of and CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD 2 , indicating that the original TOPO ligand on the surface of CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD-TOPO completely exchanged with MPA by the ligand exchange process. The 1 H-NMR chemical shift for CH 2 in the MPA ligand of CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD-MPA showed at 2.53 and 2.83 ppm 2 . The peak at 3.14 ppm is from CH 3 group in tetramethylammonium cation (TMA + ) 3 . From thermal properties of the quantum dots by TGA results, the weight % of TOPO ligand in the CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD-TOPO was 86%. In the case of CdSe/CdS/ZnS QD-MPA, the weight % of MPA ligand was 12%. It indicated that ligand exchange was complete to replace big molecular TOPO to small molecular MPA. The CdS and ZnS shells were grown over CdSe core consecutively at an optimized temperature 240\u00b0C (Fig.S1c) . The crystalline structure of the quantum dots was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in Fig. S1d . All these diffraction peaks were assigned to the reflections from the (111), (220) and (311) lattice planes of a zinc blend-structured CdSe 2-5 . The optical properties of the QD-580 and QD-650 were characterized by UV absorption and PL emission spectroscopies and are shown in Fig. S1e . Since the calculated full widths at half maxima (FWHM) of the emission spectra of QD-580 and QD-650 were approximately 27.4 nm and 40.6 nm, respectively, we established that the synthesized quantum dots were uniformly distributed. The absolute QY of the quantum dot at room temperature was determined by comparison of the integrated PL intensity of the quantum dot with that of the rhodamine 6G (R6G) in absolute ethanol. The quantum yield of quantum dot was calculated as previously described 6 ;",

The hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) of H5 subtypeor influenza A NP -primers, probes, and RT-PCR conditions have been described previously 7 , 8 . For the standard of RNA copy number, the template was generated in plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) including 106 (NP)-or 161-base pair (HA) insert. RiboMax (Promega) kit was used for the in vitro transcription of HA1 RNA and the RNA copy number for the LOD of FICT was determined. The standard curve was calculated automatically by plotting the Ct values against each standard of known RNA copy number and by extrapolating the linear regression line of this curve. The RNA copy number of the LOD (10 HAU/mL) of SRDFDS was determined by rRT-PCR. After preparing 10-fold dilution from 5 HAU/mL to 40 HAU/mL, 75 \u03bcL of virus sample was used for RNA extraction. Two calibration curves were generated by serially-diluted RNA standard of influenza A NP and H5 HA. A standard curve was drawn to show the starting copy number of the standard RNA on the X-axis vs the cycle threshold (Ct) on the Y-axis. The plot of a standard curve of Ct values against the logarithmic dilutions produced a r 2 value = 0.998 and the slope (-3.888) corresponding to efficiency in the range 80.8% for influenza A NP and a r 2 value = 0.990 and the slope (-3.261) corresponding to efficiency in the range 102.6% for H5 HA, which was close to the optimized protocol. The LOD of FICT (10 HAU/mL) corresponded to Ct value of 27.86 \u00b1 0.26 (mean \u00b1 SD) and 3.3 \u00d7 10 5 \u00b1 5,247 (mean \u00b1 SD) of RNA/\uf06dL for influenza A NP and Ct value of 28.27 \u00b1 0.095 (mean \u00b1 SD) and 5.9 \u00d7 10 5 \u00b1 3,942 (mean \u00b1 SD) of RNA/\uf06dL for H5 HA, respectively. The linear relationship between the threshold cycle (Ct) and RNA copy number of hemagglutinin (HA) of H5 subtype was determined to make the standard curve. Second bottom panel shows rRT-PCR product of standard RNAs. After preparing two-fold dilutions from 5 HAU/mL to 40 HAU/mL of H5N3 virus, the sample was subjected to RNA extraction and used for rRT-PCR. The arrows indicate Ct values and the RNA copy numbers at each virus titer. Quantum Dots (QDs) and Latex were assumed as spheres with radii r and R respectively. Scheme S1. Mode of Quantum Dots packed on the surface of Latex particle. We assumed a new sphere with radius R + r from the center of the Latex particle.
