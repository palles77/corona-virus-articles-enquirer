Based on 42,173 ill returned travelers seen by the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network at 53 different clinical sites on six continents, in patients presenting to infectious or tropical diseases specialists after travel to the developing world, specific travel destinations are associated with the probability of the diagnosis of certain diseases. 4 Diagnostic approaches and empirical therapies can be guided by these destinationspecific differences. Important region-specific disease occurrence data indicate that febrile illness is most important from Africa and Southeast Asia; malaria is one of the top three diagnoses from every region, yet over the past decade dengue has become the most common febrile illness from every region outside sub-Saharan Africa; in sub-Saharan Africa, rickettsial disease is second only to malaria as a cause of fever; respiratory disease is most important in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa; and acute diarrhea is disproportionately from South Central Asia. When individual diagnoses are collected into syndrome groups and examined for all regions together, 233 of every 1000 ill returned travelers have a systemic febrile illness, 334 have acute or chronic gastrointestinal infection, 195 have a dermatologic disorder, and 209 have a respiratory disorder.",

This may be the case, but often it is not. Routine disorders are common, and common disorders are common whether actually acquired during travel or at some time after the trip. Thus fever, sore throat, and cervical adenopathy in a college student who returned 2 weeks earlier from a developing country is still more likely to be streptococcal pharyngitis or infectious mononucleosis than diphtheria. Presented with an ill patient with a history of travel, the physician must maintain discipline in making two separate lists of differential diagnoses, the first with the travel history factored in and the second considering the same presenting symptoms and signs as if in any other patient. The approach and workup must then proceed in parallel, with appropriate priority given to the most urgent or the most treatable diagnoses at the top of each list.",

Detailed discussions of pathophysiology, spectrum of clinical manifestations, and therapy for each infectious agent are found in the disease-specific chapters of this book. Fever, traveler's diarrhea, and skin problems are the most common presenting illnesses in returned travelers. Eosinophilia is less common but is a frequent source of referral to the infectious diseases specialist. to specialists with a febrile illness is 24%, with variation by region of travel: Americas, 14%; South-Central Asia (includes India), 13%; Southeast Asia, 18%; and sub-Saharan Africa, 43%. Several large case series from busy tropical disease units indicate malaria to be the cause of the fever in 27% to 42%. [5] [6] [7] The other most common tropical diseases specific to returning travelers are dengue, rickettsial disease, typhoid fever, and those caused by enteric pathogens. Less common but important considerations are leptospirosis, chikungunya, acute schistosomiasis, and amebic liver abscess. All of these diseases have widespread distribution in the tropics and need to be considered initially in all febrile travelers. Some may be ruled out quickly based on a detailed travel and exposure history and Asia (October), South America (March), and the Caribbean (August, October). 11, 12 Exposures A detailed dietary history is essential. Budget travel and associated high-risk eating habits predispose to a variety of common enteric pathogens. A history of specific foods associated with known pathogens also should be elicited. This includes unpasteurized dairy products (Brucella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), shellfish (vibrios, enteric viruses, viral hepatitis), uncooked beef such as carpaccio and steak tartare (Toxoplasma, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157-H7), undercooked fish such as sushi and ceviche (vibrios, Anisakis, Gnathostoma), and undercooked pork or game meat (trichinosis). Exposure to fresh water or surface water in recreational or other settings may be associated with schistosomiasis [13] [14] [15] or leptospirosis. 16, 17 A history of exposure to mosquitoes and flies is generally unhelpful, but a history of tick bite (rickettsiae, relapsing fever, tick-borne encephalitis) or tsetse fly bite should be sought in the right setting. Exposures to new sexual partners, 18, 19, 20 needles, or blood should be ascertained. Rodent exposure is associated with Lassa fever, hantavirus infection, murine typhus, and rat-bite fever. A history of contact with other sick people is especially important in the post-travel setting. Travelers usually move in groups or with families or companions, all of whom will likely have shared the same exposures.",

Upper and lower respiratory tract infection, including streptococcal pharyngitis and influenza, as well as urinary tract infections, are cosmopolitan, nontropical febrile disorders that are remarkably common in travelers and should always be considered. In every series from sophisticated referral centers, up to 22% to 25% of those presenting with fever have self-limited illnesses that never have an etiologic diagnosis confirmed. 7 These are mostly viral syndromes caused by one of hundreds of viral agents that exist outside developed countries for which diagnostic tests may not be available anywhere. In many cases, the time and expense of a large panel of viral isolation and serologic assays is not warranted outside the research setting.

Knowledge of typical incubation periods (Table  324 -2) of possible infectious causes is a key tool in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Many agents are simply not biologically possible outside their usual incubation period. Arboviral diseases such as dengue uniformly have short incubation periods. Onset of illness more than 2 weeks after the last possible exposure effectively rules out this class of viral illness. None of the known hemorrhagic fever viruses has a possible incubation longer than 21 days. Long-incubation infections like schistosomiasis cannot present less than several weeks after first possible exposure. Some diseases such as malaria or enteric fever have more variable incubation periods but nevertheless have a typical incubation period during which time the majority of the patients present. A number of diseases, especially those that are arthropod borne, have a strict seasonality whereby transmission stops during either cold or dry weather. Examples would include malaria in nontropical countries such as Korea, Tajikistan, or northern China, as well as Lyme borreliosis or tick-borne encephalitis, all of which completely cease transmission during winter months. GeoSentinel surveillance data indicate that dengue cases in travelers show marked regionspecific peaks for Southeast Asia (June, September), South-Central malarious areas have the highest risk for infection. Resources describing current country-specific malaria microepidemiology should be immediately accessible to those assessing tropical fevers. In general, malaria is a rural disease, but the cities of Africa and India are exceptions. P. falciparum malaria in nonimmune travelers most commonly has an incubation period of 9 to 14 days, and 90% of cases occur within 1 month of last exposure. Non-P. falciparum malaria in travelers is only rarely life threatening but can present much later after arrival. Incubation periods are prolonged in those taking inadequate or incomplete chemoprophylaxis. Relapses of disease due to Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale may occur many months after travel in those whose initial attack was clinically silent because of suppressive chemoprophylaxis but in whom terminal prophylaxis with primaquine was not used (see Chapter 276).",

Classic periodic malarial fever is not a usual manifestation of imported malaria, although when fever does occur in discrete, repeated 48-or 72-hour cycles, the diagnosis is almost certain. The simian malaria parasite P. knowlesi, 26 which is now known to commonly infect humans in Malaysia and throughout Southeast Asia, uniquely has a periodicity of 24 hours.

Patients often look and feel particularly unwell, with severe prostration and high, unremitting fever. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia often occur. Blood cultures are not always positive, but bone marrow cultures increase the yield. Serologic assays, including agglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), have overall poor sensitivity, especially early in the course, and some lack of specificity in some settings and enjoy poor reputations. However, when present, an unequivocal high titer in a previously na\u00efve traveler provides a more rapid diagnosis than will blood cultures. Up-to-date vaccination against typhoid provides only partial protection against Salmonella typhi and does not protect at all against Salmonella Paratyphi. 30 Because of resistance, fluoroquinolones are no longer an option for empirical treatment in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and third-generation cephalosporins or a carbapenem should be used. 27 Increasing data support the use of high-dose oral azithromycin for quinolone-resistant S. typhi. 30",

In contrast, protozoal diarrhea (most often due to Giardia lamblia or Entamoeba histolytica) begins gradually, with loose stools occurring in distinct episodes and gradually becoming more disabling over 1 to 2 weeks. In protozoal diarrhea, medical care usually is not sought immediately because of the low-grade nature of the symptoms. Because most traveler's diarrhea is bacterial, many travelers are instructed to self-treat with quinolone antibiotics and are told to seek medical assistance if diarrhea does not resolve after 3 to 5 days of treatment. [51] [52] [53] [54] Classic traveler's diarrhea is defined as three or more unformed stools per day, although a syndrome of nonclassic traveler's diarrhea with fewer stools but with accompanying symptoms is defined by some. Travelers may vary in their own definition of what is an abnormal bowel pattern, and this needs to be established with the patient in a quantitative way at the outset. Returned travelers with acute diarrhea of a few days' duration who have not yet had a course of quinolone antibiotic can be prescribed an empirical course without any workup or stool culture. Toxic patients with bloody diarrhea should have a wet prep of stool and an immediate sigmoidoscopic examination to look for amebic trophozoites. Nonresponders at 36 to 48 hours should then have stool specimen sent for performance of bacterial culture, ova and parasite testing, acid-fast bacilli testing (to detect Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora), Giardia enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence assay, Entamoeba ELISA, and Clostridium difficile toxin assay. Vibrio cultures usually require a special request. Quinoloneresistant Campylobacter is increasing worldwide and is prevalent in Southeast Asia, so an empirical course of azithromycin can be given while awaiting culture if the patient is still moderately ill. 53 Rifaximin has been approved for traveler's diarrhea due to E. coli. 54 Because of the difficulty in making the diagnosis of giardiasis, an empirical course of tinidazole is often given in practice to those with subacute symptoms and a negative workup. Reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter's syndrome) is an occasional sequela of enteritis due to Shigella or Campylobacter.",

HIV infection and its complications, syphilis, and tuberculosis should be sought at this stage if there is any suggestive exposure at all. After ruling out potentially serious as well as potentially treatable infections by history, physical examination, and routine laboratory work, and especially if patient financial resources are limiting, the clinician must then decide whether to wait 48 to 72 hours before serology and sophisticated diagnostic studies are pursued. Because up to 25% of all febrile illnesses in returning travelers are self-limited viral syndromes, a patient who was highly febrile and quite toxic looking at initial assessment is quite often perfectly well 48 hours later with no intervention. Reasonable clinical and local laboratory experience and confidence are required for this approach, but from the patient standpoint it is the most desirable course. At a minimum, acute serum should be stored for possible later use.

Thus, in this situation, if clinical suspicion is high, the patient may need to be admitted for parenteral therapy. Empirical therapy for malaria without a positive blood film is appropriate if clinical evidence of cerebral dysfunction or any other end-organ damage consistent with malaria is present. Otherwise, examination of these patients and of serial blood smears over several days by someone with appropriate experience will generally lead to the parasitologic diagnosis of malaria, when present. 44 Expertise is rarely so far away as to compromise patient care, although empirical therapy with co-artemether or atovaquone-proguanil is generally well tolerated. However, empirical treatment will necessarily eliminate any possibility of making a species diagnosis if the patient, in fact, does have malaria.

Some helpful physical findings are dermatitis (onchocerciasis, cutaneous larva migrans, larva currens); migratory swellings (loiasis, gnathostomiasis); wheezing or cough (Strongyloides, hookworm, Ascaris, or Schistosoma larvae in the lung); hemoptysis (Paragonimus); hepatomegaly (Toxocara, Echinococcus); lymphedema (filariasis); facial edema and myositis (trichinosis); subcutaneous mass (cysticercosis); meningeal signs (angiostrongyliasis, gnathostomiasis); and abdominal tenderness (angiostrongyliasis, anisakiasis, fascioliasis).",

The limited number of available cost-effectiveness studies have yet to show significant benefit to this approach on a population basis. [71] [72] [73] Neither a clinic visit nor any nondirected laboratory screening of returned very short-term travelers is indicated. Exceptions are those with known discrete highrisk exposure events in situations conducive to transmission of specific agents. This would include testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, a purified protein derivative skin test or interferon-\u03b3 release assay, or Schistosoma serology. For those who have spent 6 malabsorption, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody/antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody serologic studies for inflammatory bowel disease, antigliadin/antiendomysial/antitransglutamase antibodies for celiac disease, and upper and lower endoscopy with all aspirates and biopsy samples examined carefully for a parasitic cause. G. lamblia, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cyclospora cayetanensis are occasional infectious causes of persistent diarrhea and may be discovered only after invasive workup. Serology for S. stercoralis, Schistosoma mansoni, or E. histolytica is indicated when exposure to these agents may have occurred. Intestinal biopsy almost always yields nonspecific findings, although cases of tropical or nontropical sprue are occasionally discovered or an initial diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease made. In many patients, the etiology of the frequently found nonspecific villus blunting is unclear. This syndrome has often been termed tropical enteropathy or postinfective tropical malabsorption and is believed to be the residual damage caused by an initial bacterial or other insult. A temporary luminal disaccharidase deficiency may occur. Diarrhea may persist for months before resolving. In the absence of definitive diagnosis in patients with chronic traveler's diarrhea, symptomatic treatment with loperamide is indicated. Elimination diets with restriction of lactose, fructose, gluten, and fat are sometimes of benefit. Those with preexisting irritable bowel syndrome may have it unmasked by travel and frequently have exacerbations during or after travel. Tegaserod, alosetron, antispasmodics, or other appropriate medication for the underlying disease may be needed. [56] [57] [58] [59] ",

Seabather's eruption (sometimes called \"sea lice\") is a pruritic papular rash notable for being distributed only on skin covered by the patient's bathing suit. 66 Larval sea anemones become trapped by the fabric while the patient is swimming. The indurated erythematous chancre of Trypanosoma rhodesiense infection (see Chapter 279) should not be overlooked. 67 Arboviral eruptions usually present as acute febrile illnesses and not as predominant rash illnesses.

Returning travelers and long-term residents of tropical countries are as prone to nonparasitic causes of eosinophilia as is the general population, and these must be considered when obtaining a history and initiating a diagnostic workup in a returned traveler. Schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasis are the most common parasitic causes of significant eosinophilia in returning travelers, and serology should be sent on every traveler with potential exposure to either. 68, 69 Eosinophilia is a reaction to a tissue-invasive helminth, with its intensity being proportional to the degree of tissue invasion. During the initial larval migration phase after a new infection with a specific parasite (e.g., hookworm), there may be an intense eosinophilia (up to 5000/mm 3 ). Weeks or months later, when the mature adults reside FIGURE 324-2 Some common diseases of travelers with pathologic effects localized to circumscribed areas of the skin and underlying tissue. A, Painless ulcer with a clean base in a traveler to Peru with New World cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis. B, More nodular and inflammatory lesions with crusting but only slight ulceration in a traveler to Afghanistan, which is more characteristic of Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania major. C, Painless nasal perforation, which is often the earliest manifestation of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis due to metastatic spread of L. braziliensis from an earlier cutaneous lesion. D, Cutaneous larva migrans or creeping eruption due to the canine hookworm Ancylostoma caninum. E, Furuncular myiasis due to Dermatobia hominis (botfly). Patients often report a sense of movement inside; note tiny hole for the respiratory spicule of the botfly. F, D. hominis larva after migration to surface when the respiratory spicule was blocked with petroleum jelly. G, Characteristic multilesion presentation of African furuncular myiasis due to Cordylobia anthropophaga (tumbu fly). H, Phytophotodermatitis in a traveler to Ecuador after application of a lime juice-containing mixture by a shaman during a native ceremony; the same effect is seen when common tropical cocktails are spilled on sun-exposed areas. Pigmented lesions may take weeks to resolve. I, Tropical pyomyositis in a traveler to the Amazon. Pyomyositis due to deep staphylococcal infection is common in moist, warm climates and is characterized by brown pus as the muscle fibers dissolve. Initial lesions are characterized by exquisitely painful, localized erythematous areas overlying the affected muscle. months or more under any conditions in a developing country, a purified protein derivative skin test or interferon-\u03b3 release assay is the highest priority even without a specific exposure. For those living under harsher conditions, any abnormalities found on a complete physical examination, including a dermatologic assessment, that would lead to specific laboratory testing should be sought first. For general screening, a stool sample for ova and parasite testing and an eosinophil count are used by most. Serologic studies for schistosomiasis, filarial infection, and strongyloidiasis are often performed but should be strictly limited to those with extended travel to a known endemic area for each pathogen tested for. Those with new sexual partners should be screened for HIV and sexually transmitted infections at an appropriate interval after last potential exposure. Malaria smears are not indicated in asymptomatic travelers, even those with a remote history of malaria exposure during the travel, but primaquine treatment for those at risk for later relapse of disease due to P. vivax or P. ovale is indicated.
