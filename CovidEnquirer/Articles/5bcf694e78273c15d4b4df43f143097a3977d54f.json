Until recently, the presence of rhinovirus in the nasal secretions of an individual presenting with symptoms of the common cold, could only be demonstrated by cultivation in a'sensitive cell or organ culture (Al-Nakib and Tyrrell, 1988) . Recently, however, cDNA probes have been successfully used to detect the presence of viral RNA in filter hybridization assays, although viruses present at low concentrations (<IO\" TCID&ml) may not be detected (Al-Nakib et al., 1986) . In situ hybridization has recently been applied in the rapid diagnosis of a number of virus infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) in liver graft cells (Naoumov et al., 1988) herpes simplex virus (HSV) in brain cells (Forghani et al., 1985) , human papillomavirus in cervical tissues (Burns et al., 1987) ; and adenoviruses in cells obtained from nasopharyngeal secretions (Gomes et al., 1985) . This technique is useful in that viral nucleic acid sequences can be located within individual cells using complementary probes labelled with an isotope such as \"-phosphorus or non-isotopic label such as biotin. We report on the application of in situ hybridization for the detection of rhinoviruses directly in cells obtained from nasal washings of human volunteers infected with a rhinovirus. This technique may have important application both for the detection of infection by demonstrating virus RNA in single cells and also for the study of the pathogenesis of this virus in the respiratory tract.",

Samples were spun for 5 min at 500 x g in a bench centrifuge. This resulted in the mucus remaining at the top of the gradient while the cells had pelleted. The cells were resuspended in PBS and aliquoted out onto 12-well multitest microscope slides (Flow) which had previously been coated with poly-I-iysine. After air drying, the cells were fixed with freshly prepared periodatelysine-parafo~aldehyde ]PLP; three parts buffered lysine (0.1 M lysine, 0.005 M Nal HPOd), one part 8%. paraformaldehyde, 0.01 M sodium periodate].

Control slides were prepared by infecting confluent layers of Ohio HeLa cells grown in Lab Tek (Plow Laboratories) eight chamber glass slides with HRV-14. When approximately 50% of the cells showed cytopathic effect (CPE), the slides were washed three times with PBS and fixed with PLP as described for the clinical samples.",

Twenty microlitres of the probe in the hybridization mixture was applied to each well of the slides including those of the controls.

Various different fixatives such as Camoy's (6 parts absolute alcohol, I part acetic acid, 3 parts chloroform) and PLPG (periodate-lysineparaformaldehyde-glutarate, 0.5% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutarate in buffered lysine [see PLP] and 0.01 M sodium periodate) were initially evaluated. How-ever, PLP gave the most consistent results and was particularly useful since it also maintained cell morphology. Eighteen minutes incubation with proteinase K produced the best results, whereas incubation of less than 15 min or more than 20 min were not optimal and often resulted in fewer cells being positive.",

In samples which had no mucus, this method was adequate. However, if mucus was present, which it frequently was, it was pelleted down with the cells and later transferred to the multitest slide. The presence of the mucus prevented the cells from properly adhering to the slide surface and hence were lost following subsequent processing. The use of a Percoll gradient to separate the mucus from the cells, therefore, greatly improved cell retention although still some 1040% of cells were lost during the procedure.",

Only 14 of 38 (37%) volunteers had significant antibody rises as detected by the neutralisation test. Of the 38 volunteers analysed, 13 (34%) had significant colds. Of these 12 (92%) and 10 (77%) were positive by virus isolation or ISH, on at least one day, respectively. Six (46%) had significant antibody rises (Table 1) . Similarly, of the 38 volunteers challenged, 22 (58%) were asymptomatic and of these 10 (45.5%) and 12 (54.5%) were positive by virus isolation and ISH, on at least one day, respectively (Table 1) . Only eight (36.4%) of these asymptomatic volunteers showed significant antibody increases by neutralization. These results clearly show that both virus isolation and ISH were more sensitive than serology in providing evidence of infection. Fig. 2 , shows the percentage of volunteers showing a positive test on different days after virus challenge when the whole group of volunteers was c,onsidered. As shown in the figure there generally was no significant association between the proportion of volunteers who excreted virus and those who were positive for HRV-14 RNA by ISH, except on day 3 after virus challenge, (P=O.O2). Fig. 3 compares the proportion of volunteers who excreted virus with those who were positive for viral RNA by ISH on different days after virus_challenge in the group of volunteers who developed symptoms of colds. As shown in the figure, generally more volunteers who developed colds were found positive by virus isolation than by ISH in the first four days after virus challenge and there was a significant association (P=O.O25) between HRV-14 RNA detection by ISH and the detection of virus by isolation on day 3. However, on day 5 after virus challenge, 54% of volunteers showed a positive test by ISH as compared with only 38% by virus isolation (P=O.O8). Fig. 4 compares the results of both tests on different days after virus challenge when the asymptomatic group of volunteers was considered.

However, this procedure may complement other methods and can be useful for the study of rhinovirus pathogenicity. Indeed, the whole process of rhinovirus infection of the nasal epithelium and the mechanism by which it produces disease in man is still not entirely clear (Sperber and Hayden, 1988) . Furthermore, the role of this virus in the development of lower respiratory tract infection which may be serious in immunocompromised patients (Krilov et al., 1986) or in triggering episodes of bronchitis and asthma (Gregg, 1983 ) require more precise and detailed investigations.
