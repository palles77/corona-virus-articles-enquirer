He was taken by his parents to visit a doctor at the outpatient clinic of the children's hospital on May 3, where he was initially diagnosed as having infant hepatitis syndrome. On May 5, the child was admitted to the children's hospital with the diagnosis of neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis and was kept at a ward (room X, zone 10) in the gastroenterology department. However, the child developed a fever and started to cough on May 25. On the following day, red maculopapules were found on his face and trunk, and white spots were found on his oral mucous membrane. His body temperature became normal on May 28. He was diagnosed clinically as having acute bronchitis, measles, and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis in a consultation on May 29. He started to recover on June 5 and was discharged from the hospital on June 7 (Figs 1 and 2) .",

The primary cause of the hospital-acquired infection event was that the possibility of measles was not considered for child B's diagnosis when he was admitted to the children's hospital, although red maculopapules and desquamation were found on his face and trunk. If he had been assigned to an isolated room for treatment, the transmission of measles infection and hMPV infection to others could have been avoided. Therefore, the improvement of diagnostic ability for respiratory virus infections and enhanced measures of isolation treatment are relevant to the control of nosocomial infection of respiratory viruses. This report sheds light on the importance of making accurate clinical diagnoses and instituting infection control measures early in the course of an illness.",
