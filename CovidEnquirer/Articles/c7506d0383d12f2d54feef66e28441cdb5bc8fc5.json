The aim of the survey was to investigate the pre-travel health-seeking practices of travelers to Asian destinations. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted at the Athens International Airport between the 1st of November 2011 and the 30th of April 2013. Results: A total of 1666 adult travelers participated in the study, and 69.7% were men. The mean age of the participants was 39 years. Previous travel to tropical countries was reported by 69% of the participants. The most frequent destination was the Indian subcontinent (45.0%). The main reasons for travel were visiting friends and relatives (VFRs; 36.5%) and business (32.4%). Most of the participants traveled for <1 month (51.4%). Only 24.5% pursued pre-travel consultations. Vaccinations were administered to 14.4% of the participants, and of those, 77%, 73%, and 32.5% received hepatitis A, tetanus/diphtheria, and typhoid vaccines, respectively. Malaria prophylaxis was given to 12.2% of the participants. Logistic regression analysis revealed that being male and unemployed, having an elementary level of education, traveling to visiting friends and relatives, and short durations of travel were significant determinants of not seeking pre-travel consultations.",

A standard multiple logistic regression was conducted (with the variables with p-values <0.15 in the univariate analyses) to examine the relations between pre-travel preparation and independent factors. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify the factors that influenced the decision to seek a pretravel consultation. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. Unanswered items were excluded from the analyses. The analyses were performed using STATA v12.1 software.",

Those traveling to VFRs predominantly visited the Indian subcontinent, the business travelers predominately visited the Middle East (most had East Asia as a second destination) and East Asia, and those who traveled for recreation predominately visited Southeast Asia. A change in the demographic pattern of Greek travelers to developing countries was shown in the current survey relative to previous studies [26] , which might reflect the influence of the economic crisis in Greece on immigration and international travel; there have been gradual increases in the proportion of travelers who are traveling to VFRs and business travelers and a decrease in the number of people traveling for recreation. However, according to a recent Greek study, only 24.7% of all business travelers going to developing countries are vaccinated [27] . Although the vaccination rate in the current survey was low, it is comparable to the results of other studies [8, 12, 14, 15] . The hepatitis A vaccine was the most prevalent vaccine delivered. Similarly, this was found to be the most common vaccine administered in a United States study and in two Australian studies, which also reported similar rates [8, 10, 14, 15] . However, the vaccination rate for hepatitis A was lower than expected as indicated by retrospective analyses of travel and the travelers' characteristics. This finding might be attributable to the travelers' lack of knowledge about high-risk destinations [25] and possible pre-existing immunities [28] . The typhoid vaccine was delivered to less than 5% of the travelers; this rate was lower than those reported in other studies [8, 15] . Although those traveling to VFRs accounted for more than one-third of the travelers, and their main destination was the Indian subcontinent, only a few had received a typhoid fever vaccine. Retrospective analyses based on travel and the travelers' characteristics revealed that the rate of vaccination rate against typhoid fever was lower than expected (35%). The low rate of vaccination against rabies might be related to the travelers' and travel health providers' lack of knowledge about the risks of rabies exposure, as shown in a recent study from Greece, and to the time between consultation and departure [29, 30] .",

Retrospective analyses of the data revealed that less than one-quarter of all travelers who visited malaria endemic areas, such as the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, received chemoprophylaxis. Only a few of those traveling to VFRs and approximately half of the business travelers who traveled to malaria endemic areas were prescribed chemoprophylaxis. The results of this survey suggest that the rate of malaria prophylaxis was below the expected rate, particularly among special groups, such as those traveling to VFRs and business travelers. These findings might be attributable to a lack of awareness about the risks of the disease among the travelers [26, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .",
