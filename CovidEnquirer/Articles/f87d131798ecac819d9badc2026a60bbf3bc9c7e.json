Results obtained from Sims's first-order DSGE representation suggest that two policy variableschanges in the exchange rate and changes in the real interest rate lagged by one quarteract as stabilizers for contemporaneous changes in stock indices for Thailand, Malaysia, and the U.S., but as destabilizers for Taiwan and Hong Kong. However, changes in personal consumption expenditure lagged by one quarter only play a destabilizing role in Hong Kong. For contemporaneous changes in the current account balance, all three policy variables become destabilizers for all five countries except the one-quarter lagged change in real interest rate, which acts as a stabilizer in Malaysia. \u00df",

The second area has been investigated from national and regional perspectives (Baig & Goldfajn, 1999; Glick & Spiegel, 2010; Hasan, 2002; Ho, 2011) . Table 1 reports quarterly variations in the stock market indices and current account balances of four Southeast/East Asian countries/areas (henceforth countries) and the U.S. during financial crises. These include Thailand, Malaysia, the Republic of Table 1 indicates the severity of the losses in stock market indices in Asian countries. In Thailand alone, the loss in the Stock Exchange of Thailand index (SET) reached 70 percent from 1997Q1 to 1998Q3, whereas the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) experienced a 2 percent gain. During the same period, the Thai current account balance increased by 261 percent and the U.S. figure by 36 percent.",

One channel is inadequate risk management (Dwyer & Tkac, 2009; Hellwig, 2008) , and another is business cycle movement (Barro & Urs\u00fa a, 2009 ). The third channel highlights the wealth effect in monetary policy (Ludvigson, Steindel, & Lettau, 2002; Mishkin, 2013) . In theory, a high level of wealth should lead to a higher level of consumption and ultimately promote higher levels of aggregate income (Fair, 1971; Starr-McCluer, 1998) . The effects of changes in wealth have been studied, i.e., a change in wealth holdings leads to a change in consumption, thereby generating a change in income (Stevans, 2004) . Would personal consumption expenditure actively affect a stock index and the current account in a general equilibrium-framework in the presence of financial crises? This issue has yet to be examined in depth. During unexpected financial crises, what are the relationships between three macroeconomic policy variables, namely, personal consumption expenditure, the exchange rate, and the interest rate, and two state variables, namely, a stock market index and the nation's current account balance? The purpose of this study is to explore these relationships to shed some light on this area.",

It is possible to compare this study's results with those of other studies using OLS, the VAR, and the GMM. Quarterly data from 1997 to 2010 constitute the study period. This paper is organized as follows: a brief literature review is provided in Section 2, the methodology and data will be discussed in Section 3, and the empirical results are presented in Section 4, followed by an analysis in Section 5. Section 6 reports on an application of the results, and Section 7 concludes with policy implications.",

            "text": "A brief discussion of studies of financial crises, stock market indices, and current accounts is presented below. Mishkin (2000) identifies three causes of the 1997 AFC: speculative funds, an unsophisticated market structure, and a weak regulatory environment. Click and Plummer (2005) in addressing the equity market integration issue in the ASEAN-5 nations following the 1997 AFC, conclude that co-integration exists. Regarding the 2008 GFC, Eichengreen (2008) considers the reasons for crises in numerous countries, excluding the U.S., to be the time required to effectively respond, a lack of government actions, and a limited policy choice set. Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) compare 18 historical financial crises in industrialized nations and claim that such crises are related to international capital flows and the country's current account balance. Concerning the relationship between the current account and financial crises, Danninger and Jaumotte (2008) , and Obstfeld (2012) observe differences in current account behaviors among emerging Asian and European countries. After comparing current accounts surpluses in Southeast Asian economies from 1997 to 1998, Moreno (2008) suggests that the explanation of these surpluses appears to be the large capital outflows from these countries. Medina, Prat, and Bauer (2010) examine the equilibrium current accounts in 33 emerging market countries, Thailand and Malaysia included, and suggest that their central governments need to maintain fiscal balance. Hoontrakul (2008) evaluates the impact of the 2008 GFC on the Thai economy excluding the stock market, with respect to risks from a banker's perspective. Jiranyakul (2009) , using the Johansen test, claims that co-integration exists among the stock index, real GDP, money supply, nominal effective exchange rate, and price level in Thailand. He also claims that the 1997 AFC had no influence on stock prices. Chirathivat and Malikamas (2010) state that Thailand has been affected by the U.S. sub-prime crisis. Baharumshah and Ismail (2012) report the close correlation between changes in the current account and the present value of future net output based on a VAR model. Examining the SET index, Chokesirikuchai et al. (2013) confirm the sensitivities of the interactions between the stock index and exchange rate and between the interest rate and inflation rate. However, the authors do not include financial crises in their OLS model and the study period does not include the 1997 AFC. Chen and Huang (2012) , using the Markov approach, suggest that financial crises have negative effects on the SET index.",

The change in the HK Hang Seng index of 2001.32 reported in row 1 is the largest value observed in the five countries considered.

Row 2 reports the product of l 2 and the one-period lagged change in the exchange rate shown in equation 7. For Thailand, only .04 percent of the average stock index change of 79.77 can be attributed to the one-period lagged change in the exchange rate. Malaysia fared better, with a negative .37 percent of the change in the KLCI index being attributable to the one-period lagged change in the exchange rate. The results for the countries indicate a contribution of less than one percent. For the U.S., changes in the exchange rate exhibit an inverse relationship with changes in the DJIA index number, but this change is of insignificant magnitude. This result suggests that changes in consumption expenditures contribute much less than changes in the interest or exchange rated with respect to changes in stock market indices during 2009.",
