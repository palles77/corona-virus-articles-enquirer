            "text": "Indoor air can be an important vehicle for a variety of human pathogens. This review provides examples of airborne transmission of infectious agents from experimental and field studies and discusses how airborne pathogens can contaminate other parts of the environment to give rise to secondary vehicles leading air-surface-air nexus with possible transmission to susceptible hosts. The following groups of human pathogens are covered because of their known or potential airborne spread: vegetative bacteria (staphylococci and legionellae), fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium spp and Stachybotrys chartarum), enteric viruses (noro-and rotaviruses), respiratory viruses (influenza and coronaviruses), mycobacteria (tuberculous and nontuberculous), and bacterial spore formers (Clostridium difficile and Bacillus anthracis). An overview of methods for experimentally generating and recovering airborne human pathogens is included, along with a discussion of factors that influence microbial survival in indoor air. Available guidelines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other global regulatory bodies for the study of airborne pathogens are critically reviewed with particular reference to microbial surrogates that are recommended. Recent developments in experimental facilities to contaminate indoor air with microbial aerosols are presented, along with emerging technologies to decontaminate indoor air under fieldrelevant conditions. Furthermore, the role that air decontamination may play in reducing the contamination of environmental surfaces and its combined impact on interrupting the risk of pathogen spread in both domestic and institutional settings is discussed. \u00a9 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.",

            "text": "Air, a universal environmental equalizer, affects all living and nonliving forms on planet earth. For humans, it has profound health implications in all indoor environments where we normally spend most of our time. [1] [2] [3] Air quality is also forever changing because of the influence of many controllable and uncontrollable factors that are virtually everywhere. Indoor air, in particular, can expose us to noxious chemicals, particulates, and a variety of infectious agents, as well as pollen and other allergens. 4, 5 Emerging pathogens, such as noroviruses 6 and Clostridium difficile, 7 have also been detected in indoor air, with a strong potential for airborne dissemination. Pathogens discharged into the air may settle on environmental surfaces, which could then become secondary vehicles for the spread of infectious agents indoors. 8 The possible transmission of drug-resistant bacteria by indoor air adds another cause for concern. 9 A combination of on-going societal changes is adding further to the potential of air as a vehicle for infectious agents. [10] [11] [12] The quality of indoor air is therefore a prominent public health concern 13,14 that requires a clear understanding of the transmission processes for the development and implementation of targeted infection prevention and control measures. 15 Although direct and indirect exposure to pathogens in the air can occur by other means, infections from the inhalation and retention, including translocation and ingestion after inhalation of droplet nuclei, are generally regarded as true airborne spread. Aerosols of various sizes that contain infectious agents can be emitted from a variety of sources, such as infected or colonized individuals 16 or flushing toilets, and may expose susceptible persons either directly (droplet transmission) or by remaining suspended in the air for inhalation (airborne transmission). 17, 18 Contrary to the conventionally held belief, modeling work has redefined the Wells evaporation-falling curve, 19, 20 revealing that expelled large droplets could be carried >6 m away by exhaled air at a velocity of 50 m/s (sneezing), >2 m away at a velocity of 10 m/s (coughing), and <1 m away at a velocity of 1 m/s (breathing), leading to potential transmission of short-range infectious agents that contain aerosols. 21 Airborne transmission requires that pathogens survive the process of aerosolization and persist in the air long enough to be transmitted to a susceptible host. 22 Aerosolized pathogens may settle onto environmental surfaces in the immediate vicinity, leading to genesis of secondary vehicles (Fig 1) . 23 This review provides current information on the spread of human pathogens by indoor air, with a focus on the major classes of human pathogens from experimental and field studies, and on emerging air decontamination technologies, including test protocols developed to assess their performance under field-relevant conditions.",

These sources may include humans; pets; plants; plumbing systems, such as operational toilets and shower heads; heating, ventilation, vacuuming, mopping, and air-conditioning systems; resuspension of settled dust; and outdoor air. The yellow and red dots represent human pathogens or harmless microorganisms. Adapted with permission from BioMed Central. 23 in their test design. First, the number of inhaled microbes may not be known or it may be unrealistically high. Second, the test protocol may not have fully excluded microbial exposure by means other than inhalation. Third, there may be incomplete recording of the environmental conditions (eg, RH, air temperature) to assess their impact on microbial viability. Fourth, pertinent differences may exist between laboratory-adapted strains of the tested microbe compared with strains in the field. Studies using the actual pathogen aerosolized in body fluids provide the strongest evidence of pathogen survivability. 18 In contrast, field studies face their own set of challenges, which include the noise, bulk, and expense of inefficient air collection devices. 25 Moreover, passive impingers may not adequately collect low concentrations of pathogens found in the clinical environment. 33 Slit sampling does not impose size exclusion and may be more effective at recovering viable pathogens of any size. 33 From a methodologic perspective, field studies also must control for potential variables, such as air turbulence or human activity in areas proximate to sampling, such that sampling occurs before, during, and after an area is occupied and should include functioning ventilation systems. 34 We have previously reviewed published studies on the airborne spread of viruses of animals and humans. 13, 25 Table 2 summarizes key human pathogens with evidence of aerosol transmission.

            "text": "Experimental studies have used surrogates for human pathogenic enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, such as Cystovirus (\u03d56) and bacteriophage MS-2, respectively. 35 Enteric viruses are transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route, but airborne transmission has been reported. 13 Airborne transmission of norovirus may be possible via aerosolization of vomitus and toilet flushing, which are regarded as potential sources of both indoor air and environmental surface contamination. Enteric bacteria and viruses have been recovered from indoor air and environmental surfaces in areas sur-rounding toilets. 18, 36, 37 We reported that aerosolized simian rotavirus SA-11 38 survived best at midrange RH. 39, 40 These results contradicted a prior study by Moe and Harper, 41 in which the UK strain of calf rotavirus was reported to survive best at low and high RH, but not at high temperature. 41 Subsequent studies on human rotavirus, 39 murine rotavirus, and a UK strain of calf rotavirus, aerosolized under the same experimental setup, confirmed the behavior of all strains of rotaviruses are similar in airborne state. 39, 40 Furthermore, studies of different picornaviruses (poliovirus type 1 [Sabin] and human rhinovirus) and a human coronavirus (an enveloped virus) that used the same experimental conditions produced results that were consistent with the published literature, suggesting that the experimental design did not introduce bias toward the behavior of aerosolized rotaviruses. 39, 42, 43 Among the respiratory viruses, influenza virus is present in the air around infected individuals, and airborne transmission via droplet nuclei has been demonstrated in experimental models and in reports of influenza spread on-board aircrafts. 15 Low RH favors airborne survival and transmission; however, high air exchange rates facilitate dilution of virus-containing aerosols, regardless of their size. 12 A recent study confirmed recovery of influenza virus from the air emitted by infected persons at distances of 0.5-1.5 m, which could reach the breathing zone of susceptible individuals, including health care workers. 44 Surprisingly, and in spite of much study, the exact mode of and the relative importance of various types of vehicles for transmission of rhinoviruses, which are the most frequent cause of the common cold, remain shrouded in mystery. 45, 46 The behavior of experimentally aerosolized rhinovirus type 14, which represents typical picornaviruses (as previously mentioned), 43 coupled with rhinovirus recovery from both indoor air 47 and outdoor air, 48 substantiate the role of air as a vehicle in spread of some of these picornaviruses. Taken together, an overall assessment of the available evidence suggests a role for airborne spread 49 and for the role of contaminated hands and environmental surfaces in rhinovirus dissemination. 50 Coronaviruses are the second leading cause of the common cold and are also responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome. 37 SARS is thought to be transmitted via direct contact, but airborne transmission is also suspected because the virus has been detected in air samples that were collected from rooms where a patient was recovering from SARS. 18, 33 The virus is spread through droplets and can remain viable on surfaces for several days at room temperature. The use of aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, and oxygen delivery vents, may promote dispersal of SARS via enhanced release in mists of exhaled pulmonary gases. 34, 51 Our earlier work on the behavior of aerosolized human coronaviruses 229E further substantiates the potential role of air in their aerial spread. 39 Aerosol transmission of the Ebola virus is biologically plausible. 18 The virus is present in saliva, stool, blood, and other body fluids; therefore, it could be aerosolized through symptoms associated with infection or via health care procedures. The Ebola virus has been shown to survive in the air when the half-life of the virus ranged from 15 (Zaire Ebola virus) to 24 minutes (Reston Ebola virus), and the time for 99% biologic decay of the aerosolized virus held in rotating drum (at 50%-55% RH and 22\u00b0C \u00b1 3\u00b0C) was estimated to be between 104 and 162 minutes. Additionally, infection of rhesus monkeys via experimentally aerosolized Ebola virus has also been reported. 52 These findings raise concerns for aerosol transmission and control of this serious pathogen; however, thus far, there is no clear evidence for the airborne spread of this virus in humans. 18 Epidemiologic evidence indicates transmission is associated with direct physical contact or contact with body fluids; however, the possibility of aerosolized spread has been postulated by Ebola virologists. 18, 53 Bacteria Approximately one-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus, with the anterior nares as a common site of colonization, 54 and environmental contamination plays an important role in the transmission of methicillin-resistant S aureus. Shedding of the bacteria is highly variable, but transmission likely occurs via skin squames that settle out on environmental surfaces in the vicinity. Smaller particles may remain airborne, particularly if there is air turbulence. 54, 55 An important characteristic of the staphylococci is their ability to survive over a wide range of temperatures, RH, and exposure to sunlight. 54 Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted via droplet nuclei expectorated from infected persons during coughing, sneezing, and talking. 18, 34 Control measures include expensive negative-pressure ventilation and less expensive, but climate-dependent, natural ventilation. 56 Upper-room ultraviolet (UV) light or negative air ionization may help reduce the airborne spread of M tuberculosis. 56 Nontuberculous mycobacteria are found in soil and water sources and can form biofilms under domestic environments, such as shower heads. 57 Transmission to humans is uncertain, but droplet aerosolization is a suspected route of pulmonary disease, with shower heads considered a common source. 57, 58 Contamination of hospital water supplies and medical equipment are suspected in nosocomial outbreaks of disease. 59 Similarly, Legionella spp become airborne by active aerosolization of contaminated water and form biofilms in air conditioning systems. 34 Legionella-like amoebal pathogens are a subset of bacteria that grow within amoebae and often are coinfectious agents with other bacteria and fungi. 60 Clostridium difficile spores have been recovered from the air near symptomatic patients, especially those with recent-onset diarrhea. 61 Air samples were positive for C difficile in 70% of patients, and the highest levels of surface recovery were in areas closest to the patient. 7 The isolates recovered from the air were indistinguishable from those recovered from fecal samples and from the environment in the same settings. 7 Additionally, C difficile has been recovered after toilet flushing, and leaving the lid open when flushing increases contamination of surrounding environmental surfaces. 61 Airborne infection of Bacillus anthracis is affected by environmental factors that include room size, ventilation rate, and host factors, such as pulmonary ventilation rate. 62 Secondary aerosolization of viable B anthracis spores was reported after contamination of a U.S. Senate office, with >80% of particles being in the respirable size range of 0.95-3.5 \u03bcm. 14 ",

There are also a variety of fungal components that have been identified in air, including mycotoxins, ergosterols, glucans, and microbial volatile organic compounds, and these require unique analysis methods. 64 Taken together, these findings provide a foundation for the definition of sick building syndrome. 68 High humidity within sick houses and buildings allows for growth of fungi indoors, particularly species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium and Stachybotrys chartarum, an indoor mold that was associated with sick building syndrome several decades ago. 64, 68, 69 These fungi can be found in dust, furniture, carpets, and ventilation systems at concentrations ranging from 0-1,000 colony-forming unit (CFU)/m 3 . 64 In fact, carpet has been described as a sink for fungi, but it is also a source for resuspension of fungal particles into the air. 64 Various respiratory conditions (eg, wheeze, cough, asthma) have been linked to fungi and their biologic components in the indoor environment. 64 Fungal species found outdoors include Cladosporium and Alternaria spp, which are responsible for triggering hypersensitivity reactions, including rhinitis, sinusitis, and asthma. 27, 64 ",

The air-decontaminating claims of many such technologies are not based on testing under field-relevant conditions with pathogens relevant to human health, and scientifically valid and standardized protocols to generate field-relevant data for label claims for review by regulatory and public health agencies and the public at large remain unavailable. Here, we address this gap in the development of a test platform for standardized testing of commercially available devices for decontaminating indoor air of vegetative bacteria that represent airborne human pathogens. We know of only one guideline that directly relates to this topic. 71 It specifies the size of a sealed enclosure for experimental contamination of the air with aerosols of vegetative bacteria to assess technologies for their temporary reduction.

The lids of the plates were removed. A suspension of S aureus in a soil load was nebulized into the chamber with the muffin fan operating for 5 minutes to evenly distribute the airborne bacterial particles. A 2-minute air sample was then collected from the chamber using an STA sampler to determine the initial level of airborne contamination. Ten minutes were allowed to elapse for circulation of the airborne bacteria in the chamber. The muffin fan was then turned off and the airborne bacteria were allowed to settle for 30 minutes. At the end of this period, the Petri plates were retrieved and eluted for CFU to determine the titer of microbial contamination deposited on each one. Such testing allowed us to determine the levels of airborne bacteria that could settle on the plates without air decontamination procedures.",

Although classic airborne spread of pathogens occurs via droplet nuclei, droplets can potentially contaminate environmental surfaces, depending on their size and prevailing environmental conditions, thereby creating secondary vehicles for pathogens. Therefore, targeting airborne pathogens could potentially provide an additional advantage by reducing environmental surface contamination. Our preliminary findings indicate that a reduction in the level of viable airborne bacteria using active air decontamination can also reduce bacterial contamination on environmental surfaces in the same setting. Therefore, targeting airborne pathogens could entail additional benefits, such as preventing or reducing the deposition of harmful microbes on secondary vehicles that include frequently touched environmental surfaces and also preventing or reducing their resuspension from these surfaces back into the air via a variety of indoor activities (Fig 1) . 8, 12, 17, 75, 76 Further studies should investigate the role air decontamination may play in reducing the contamination of environmental surfaces and its combined impact on interrupting the risk of pathogen spread in both domestic and institutional settings.",
