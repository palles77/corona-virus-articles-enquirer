The development of new, more effective vaccines has been hampered by difficulties in isolating strains and viral genome manipulation. In the present study, we successfully isolated a highly pathogenic field strain AH2012/12, from a pig farm reporting severe diarrhea in China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new isolate belongs to group G2, which represents epidemic and pandemic field strains. Furthermore, we constructed an infectious cDNA clone of the newly isolated strain, rAH2012/12, and the rescued virus displayed phenotypic properties identical to the parental virus in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the rescued virus displayed similar pathogenicity to the parental isolate, causing high mortality rates in suckling pigs. This study provided a strong basis for the development of live attenuated vaccines and for research into the pathogenic mechanisms of this virus.",

In 2010, an outbreak of PEDV rapidly spread in China and caused substantial economic losses in the swine industry (Sun et al., 2012) . Subsequently, the etiologic agent was identified as variant PEDV (Pan et al., 2012) . The characteristics of the infection and its epidemiology were quite dramatic with the rates of morbidity and fatality approaching 100% in 1-week old piglets, despite the use of commercial, inactivated vaccines (Pan et al., 2012) . In May 2013, PED outbreaks suddenly emerged in the United States and rapidly spread nationwide, as well as to Canada and Mexico, causing high mortality rates in newborn piglets and significant financial concerns (Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "PEDV belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronavirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae family (Marthaler et al., 2013) . It possesses a 28-kb, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which is predicted to encode at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) in the following order: ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The S glycoprotein of PEDV plays an important role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, specific receptor binding, and cell membrane fusion (Bosch et al., 2003; Cruz et al., 2008) . According to the phylogenetic analyses of the spike gene, the PEDV strains were divided into two distinct clusters, designated genogroup 1 (G1; classical) and genogroup 2 (G2; field epidemic or pandemic) (Chen et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013a) . Concurrently, several US variant PEDV strains, characterized by insertions and deletions (INDELs) in the spike (S) gene and designated as S-INDEL PEDV, were found to be circulating in US swine farms Wang et al., 2014; Jarvis et al., 2016) . Therefore, the PEDV S glycoprotein is known to be an appropriate viral gene for determining the genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates and for developing diagnostic assays and effective vaccines (Lee et al., 2010; Lee and Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014) .",

However, the cell culture isolation of PEDV has proven to be difficult and even when isolated virus is obtained it may be unable to maintain infectivity upon further passage in cell culture (Chen et al., 2014) . Moreover, the necessity of trypsin increases the uncertainty and difficulty of virus isolation. Recently, several PEDV strains have been isolated and successfully grown in cell culture in the US and Korea (Chen et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015; Oka et al., 2014) . However, there are a few reports on the successful propagation of the original highly virulent strains that caused serious outbreaks of PEDV in China (Pan et al., 2012) . In this study, we attempted to isolate and propagate PEDV from various PEDV-positive samples in Vero cells, and one highly virulent Chinese strain AH2012/12 was successfully isolated and serially propagated in cell culture for over 50 passages.",

            "text": "Reverse-genetic technology is a powerful tool for researching the molecular biology and pathogenicity of viruses. To date, there have been three reports about the rescue of PEDV using different technological platforms. Li and colleagues recently described the reverse genetics of PEDV based on targeted RNA recombination technology (Li et al., 2013b) , and Juggragarn and colleagues constructed a full-length cDNA clone of PEDV by assembling contiguous cDNA fragments in an artificial bacterial chromosome (Jengarn et al., 2015) . However, these two rescued PEDV strains belonged to subgroup G1, which represents the classical PEDV strains (Lee, 2015) . A more recent study reported the generation of a virulent North American PEDV strain, PC22A, by in vitro transcription (Beall et al., 2016) . However, there is still no report on the reverse genetics of a Chinese strain of PEDV. In this study, we generated an infectious cDNA clone of the newly-isolated Chinese virulent PEDV strain, AH2012/12. In vivo experiments in pigs confirmed that the rescued virus displayed similar pathogenicity to the parental isolate. This technical advance will enable the development of effective live attenuated vaccines of this virus and research into its pathogenic mechanisms.",

The typical cytopathic effects (CPEs) of PEDV infection, such as cell fusion, syncytium, and detachment, appeared on the third day after tissue supernatant inoculation in Vero cells (Fig. 2a) . Infected cells were detected by fluorescent antibody staining. As shown in Fig. 2b , AH2012/12-infected cells exhibited fluorescence correlating to the PEDV-N protein as detected by an anti-N monoclonal antibody. Moreover, electron microscopy of a negativelystained sample revealed typical coronavirus particles, i.e. mediumsized viral particles of approximately 100-120 nm in diameter and characteristic surface projections (Fig. 2c) . To investigate whether the isolate could be efficiently cultivated and maintained in cell culture, we serially passaged isolate AH2012/12 for a total of 50 passages in Vero cells. Prominent CPEs were observed within 48 h post-infection in passages three and four. In later passages, prominent CPEs appeared within 24 h post-infection. Meanwhile, we selected five passages to infect Vero cells at the same time. The culture supernatants were collected at 24 or 48 h post-infection at which a 70% CPE is commonly developed, and the virus titers were measured. The results showed that the infectious titer of the isolate ranged from 10 4.5 to 10 6.5 TCID 50 /mL up to passage 50 (Fig. 2d) .",

            "text": "PEDV has now emerged or re-emerged as one of the most devastating viral diseases of swine in the world, leading to significant financial concerns in the global swine industry. Several PEDV vaccines have been developed such as the CV777-attenuated or -inactivated vaccines, live virus vaccine 83P-5, SM98-1 (93 passages), and DR-13 (100 passages), which have been employed in different countries (Kweon et al., 1999; Sato et al., 2011; Song et al., 2007) . However, none of these vaccines have significantly reduced the morbidity rate caused by diarrhea, or virus shedding in feces (Lee, 2015) . The low to moderate effectiveness of current PEDV vaccines appears to be due to antigenic, genetic, and phylogenetic differences between vaccine and field epidemic strains Lee et al., 2010 Lee et al., , 2015 Lee and Lee, 2014) . Therefore, epidemic PEDV or related strains prevalent in the field should be used for the development of next generation vaccines to control PED. PEDV field isolates need to be isolated and their molecular epidemiology investigated to better control and prevent future PEDV outbreaks. In China, there have only been a few reports of the successful isolation of epidemic PEDV strains (Chen et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015) . In our laboratory, we reported and sequenced the Chinese strain AH2012 (KC210145), which is most closely related to emergent strains in the USA. However, we did not successfully culture this strain in cells. In this study, we isolated an epidemic PEDV field strain AH2012/12 from a pig farm reporting severe diarrhea in Anhui province. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new isolate belonged to group G2b. We generated an infectious cDNA clone of the virulent Chinese PEDV strain and in vivo experiments in piglets revealed that the rescued virus showed similar pathogenicity to the parental isolate. Our findings will be important in the development of effective live attenuated vaccines and future studies into the pathogenicity of this virus.",

            "text": "The large size of the CoV genome and the instability of some CoV replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria, represent serious obstacles for the development of reverse genetics systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense RNA viruses. However, several alternatives to more conventional plasmid-based approaches have been established in the last thirteen years (Almazan et al., 2014) . The same is for PEDV, several reports have described the recovery of infectious particles of PEDV using different technological platforms. Li and colleagues described the reverse genetics of PEDV based on targeted RNA recombination technology that allowed for modification of the 3\u02b9-end of the viral genome, which encodes the structural proteins and the ORF3 protein (Li et al., 2013b) . The approach based on the use of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) was also overcome the large genome size and toxicity problems. Using this approach, the infectious genome of the TGEV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were generated (Almazan et al., , 2013 (Almazan et al., , 2000 . Subsequently, Jengarn and colleagues reported that the full-length cDNA clone was constructed by assembling contiguous cDNA fragments encompassing the complete genome of PEDVAVCT12 in a bacterial artificial chromosome (Jengarn et al., 2015) . In addition, a research team from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, recently reported a reverse genetics system for PEDV obtained by in vitro transcription of the clone followed by transfection of the full-length RNA (Beall et al., 2016) . In fact, this method has been developed to rescue several coronaviruses, including mouse hepatitis virus (Yount et al., 2002) , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Yount et al., 2000) , avian infectious bronchitis virus (Casais et al., 2001) , SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Scobey et al., 2013; Yount et al., 2003) . In this study, we also used this method and finally rescued a variant PEDV strain, AH2012/12, isolated from a pig farm reporting severe diarrhea in China. Reverse genetics technologies have been limited by factors relating to the construction and manipulation of molecular clones and the characterization of recombinant viruses, particularly those with large genomes. As reported in the construction of the other coronavirus infectious clones (St-Jean et al., 2006; Yount et al., 2002) , we also encountered many technical difficulties in the construction of the fulllength genome of PEDV in this study. Because of the reported phenomenon of bacterial toxicity, we initially used the low-copy number cloning vector pSMART-LC to maintain the six fragments. The results showed that all fragments, with the exception of fragment C, could be accurately maintained in this cloning vector. Fragment C, encompassing nucleotide positions 9,108-15,108, was similar to the previously reported nucleotide sites 12,810-15,657 in PEDV, which were toxic to the bacterial host (Jengarn et al., 2015) . Fortunately, when we divided fragment C into two at position 13,014, these two smaller fragments could be maintained in the pSMART-LC vector. This phenomenon revealed that the bacterial toxic domain of PEDV is likely Fig. 5 . The recovery and growth characteristics of the recombinant PEDV rAH2012/12. (a) The full-length PEDV cDNA genome was generated by ligation of the digested fragments. The label \"M\" was the DNA maker \u03bbDNA/Hind III, and the label \"1\" was the ligation product of digested fragments. (b) The CPEs of the rescue strain rAH2012/12 on Vero cells. (c) Fluorescence microscopy of rAH2012/12 on Vero cells. (d) Verification of the marker mutation in the rescued virus from rAH2012/12. One silent mutation A6602G was introduced to remove the naturally occurring PflmI site. Two 2048-nt amplicons (nucleotide positions 5922-7969) were obtained from the rescued (panel rV) and parental virus (panel wV) strains, respectively. (e) The sequence chromatograms of partial fragments (nucleotide positions 6591-6614) of rV and wV. The difference between the two chromatograms was indicated by the black box. The PflmI recognition site is CCANNNNNTGG with blue box. (f) Representative plaques (arrows) of Vero cells infected with the parental AH2012/12 strain and rescued rAH2012/12 strain, from left to right, at 2 dpi. (g) The growth curves of the parental AH2012/12 strain and the rescued rAH2012/12 strain. Epidemic PEDV infection is characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration, variable vomiting, high mortality in neonatal piglets, and high morbidity but low mortality in weaned pigs (Liu et al., 2015) . Recently, Sunhee Lee and colleagues isolated a highly enteropathogenic Korean strain KNU-141112, which caused fatalities in suckling piglets at one dpi . A highly pathogenic strain of PEDV, PC22A, isolated from an outbreak in Ohio, USA, in June 2013, caused 100% mortality in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs (Beall et al., 2016; Oka et al., 2014) . In this study, phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome revealed that AH2012/12 belongs to genogroup G2b of PEDV along with the highly pathogenic strains KNU-14112 and PC22A (Fig. 3) . In vivo experiments also exhibited that isolate AH2012/12 caused 100% mortality in newborn piglets, and the rescued virus showed similar pathogenicity to the parental strain. Although one piglet in the rAH2012/12 challenge group survived for two days longer than the piglets in the parental group, this was likely due to individual differences among the piglets. In addition, the mean PEDV RNA fecal shedding titers in rectal swab samples in this study were determined to be approximately 2 log10 lower than that of highly virulent strain-inoculated piglets in the previous report by using the described real-time RT-PCR method (Chen et al., 2016) . The possible reasons causing this different results might be the differences in modified special primers and the time point of sample collection between these two researches. Besides, the mean fecal shedding titers were reduced by the inconsistent disease progressions. Therefore, the individual difference of piglet was also one reason causing the different results. This will be improved in the future study.",

Due to the limitations of reverse genetics, previous studies have analyzed the virulence genes of PEDV by comparing sequence differences between the parent and attenuated virus, and found that the ORF3 gene might play a role in the pathogenicity of PEDV. Notably, Sato and colleagues found that the S genes of the two attenuated PEDV strains, Korean DR13 (100th) and Japanese 83P-5 (100th), showed remarkable similarity with comparable nucleotide mutations and amino acid substitutions in their parental viruses. This finding revealed that mutations in the S gene of PEDV were associated with the attenuation of virulence in vivo (Sato et al., 2011) . Using reverse genetics technology, future studies can investigate the other potential virulence genes of PEDV, as well as the S gene, to further our understanding of PEDV pathogenesis.",

Animal experiments revealed that this PEDV strain was highly pathogenic to newborn piglets. Furthermore, we performed reverse genetics of AH2012/12, and the rescued virus showed similar biological characteristics to the parental isolate both in vitro and in vivo. This is the first report of the generation of an infectious cDNA clone of a virulent Chinese PEDV strain. These advances will be key to the study of PEDV pathogenesis and, importantly, in the development of live attenuated vaccines.",
