We thus developed a technique of detection of these glycoconjugates using, as a probe, a laboratory strain of INF-C which underwent a large number of passages in eggs (Manuguerra et al., 1991) . Although isolation of INF-C has been reported to be efficient using human melanoma cell lines (Nishimura et al., 1989 ) studying the HEF protein and its binding and enzymatic properties still remains difficult. Since investigation of attachment specificity and esterase activity cannot be carried out with a small amount of virus, i.e., without any adaptation on the egg (which can alter characteristics of the haemagglutinin (Robertson et al., 1985; ) we thought it worth amplifying the entire coding region of HEF RNA segment. This was for use later for cloning, sequencing and expressing purposes. Very recently, PCR was applied to the C/JHB/1/66 strain of INF-C in order to amplify a 1397 base pair fragment of the HEF RNA segment with sequencing purposes. Two primers were used which were complementary to the sequence 28-42 of the non-coding strand and to the sequence 1425-1405 of the coding strand of the homologous strain (Szepanski et al., 1992) . Little is known about INF-C compared to the 2 other types of influenza viruses in most respects including epidemiology, virulence and immunology.",

The answers to this debate rely on virus detection when it circulates. For the time being, it is still assumed that INF-C causes only very mild influenza syndrome (Katagiri et al., 1983) but several recent isolations of strains such as G/Paris/145/91 strain, studied in the following experiments, are different and are consistent with the rare reports of severe respiratory diseases including pneumonia, mostly made in the 1950s (Andrews and McDonald, 1955; Librach, 1956; Gerber et al., 1952; Pead et al., 1985) . These findings emphasise the need for further studies of influenza C virus.

A strain of influenza C virus was isolated in the laboratory from a throat swab sampled from a 46-year-old woman. She suffered from intense headache and high fever (39.5\"C). Sampling was carried out only 12 h after the onset of the flu syndrome. The specimen was tested for the presence of influenza A and B viruses by immunocapture (Pothier et al., 1988) and cell culture (Davies et al., 1978; Hannoun et al., 1989) . The MDCK cell line used for isolation belongs to the type which expresses hardly any receptor-like molecules for INF-C (Herrler and Klenk, 1987) . The specimen was negative for influenza A and B viruses as well as for Respiratory syncytial virus ('in-house' immunocapture technique and Directigen, Becton-Dickinson, USA). The clinical sample was then tested by ELISA on nitrocellulose membrane using purified polyclonal IgG prepared from a hyperimmune rabbit inoculated with C/Johannesburg/l/66 (C/JHB/1/66). It was found positive for INF-C along with 34 other specimens and then inoculated into 8-day-old embryonated eggs by the amniotic route and incubated at 35\u00b0C: amniotic and allantoic fluids were harvested three days later. After the first passage, haemagglutination was observed and virus was inoculated by allantoic route to lo-day-old embryonated eggs and harvested three days later. The virus was identified by the haemagglutination inhibition test (HI) as described previously (Dowdle et al., 1979) , using chicken erythrocytes and antisera treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Manuguerra et al., 1992) . The identification name of the strain is G/Paris/145/91. The stock virus of G/Paris/145/91 used for all PCR experiments was the allantoic fluid corresponding to the first passage in eggs after isolation. The C/JHB/1/66 was used as a 'reference' strain. The strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34(HlNl) [A/PR/8/34] was included in our work as a control.",

All manipulations were carried out with A/PR/ 8/34(HlNl), C/JHB/1/66 and G/Paris/145/91. All experiments on influenza C virions were carried out with freshly harvested virus immediately or after having been frozen at -80\u00b0C upon harvesting; otherwise most results were negative. The HA titre of each stock of virus used was 32 or diluted to this titre. Initially, we used the universal primer Unil which can be utilised to synthesise cDNA from all segments of influenza A and B viruses. The full length of C/ JHB/1/66 HEF RNA segment is 2073 nucleotides (Pfeiffer and Compans, 1984) and that of C/California/78 is 2071 (Nakada et al., 1984) . The sequences of the primers specific for the HEF segment of INF-C were based on C/JHB/1/66 and G/California/78. Using Seqaid ver 3.7, analyses were carried out to calculate the number of mismatches between the primers and the sequences of all available HEF genes from human INF-C (Table 1 ). The positions of the first nucleotide of each primer within the targeted gene are indicated. The numbering of each strain starts with the first nucleotide sequenced as no. 1. As shown in Table 1 , most strains have not been sequenced from the very first nucleotide at the 3' end of the gene. As expected, the extent of mismatch (number of mismatches/length of the respective primer) between A/5/1, A/l 117/2 and HEF gene sequences was very high, varying from 40 to 83%. On the contrary, EnzC/ 19 1 S/2 completely matched with all the HEF gene sequences, the 7 or 8 mismatches being due to the insertion of 2 stop codons and 1 restriction site. EnzC/2032/2 matched perfectly at the expected position with 7 strains out of the 11 analysed. However, the score of mismatches was high, between 33% and 52% (depending on the restriction site built into the primer), with 4 strains C/Nara/82, C/Mississipi/80, C/Kyoto/41/82 and C/ Hyogo/83. C/2046/2 matched perfectly and at the expected position with 8 strains including the 7 strains mentioned above for EnzC/2032/2 plus C/ Mississipi/80 (Table 1 ). The score of mismatches was high (46%) with C/Nara/ 82, C/Kyoto/41/82 and C/Hyogo/83. As shown in Figure 1 , lane 5 and Table 2 Sizes of PCR products Expected and observed sizes of PCR products are summarised. The sizes of the expected fragments were calculated according to the published sequences of C/JHB/l/66 (Pfeiffer and Compans, 1984) and A/PR/8/34 (Winter et al., 1981) . 18/2 pair of primers (Table 3) (Fig. 1, lane 6) . A band of 1908 bp was expected ( Table 2) . As a positive reaction control (Fig. 1, lane l) , A/PR/ 8/34 RNA segments were transcribed into cDNAs with Unil and the cDNAs were then amplified with the A/5/1 and A/l 117/2 primers specific for the HA1 ",

            "text": "The products of amplification of the full length HEF cDNA (from position 10 to 2046) obtained for G/Paris/145/91 can be used for direct sequencing. The products of the PCR primed with backward primers into which restriction sites had been built, such as HindIIIC/1918/2, XbaIC/1918/2, XbaIC/2032/2 and S&C/2032/2 (Table 4 ) were used to prepare DNA fragments (Fig. 2 , lanes 5-8) for cloning purposes in the sequencing vector: bacteriophage M13mp19 (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and also in the shuttle expression vector: plasmide pSV-SPORT1 (Gibco/BRL, USA). The occurrence of HindIII, SacI, ,S&I, SmaI and X&I restriction sites was assessed for all the sequences of INF-C HEF cDNA published so far, obtained from Genbank, and also in purified PCR products. As shown in Table 5 , the existence of a Hind111 restriction site, which was predictable from the published sequence of C/JHB/1/66, was confirmed for the PCR product. Occurrence of Hind111 restriction sites varies from strain to strain. As shown in Table 5 , the number of sites varies from 0 to 2. The strains C/California/78 and G/England/892/83 have no Hind111 site, whereas C/Taylor/ 1233/47, C/Nara/82, C/Mississipi/80, C/Kyoto/41/82 as well as C/JHB/1/66 have 2 sites and C/Yamagata/l0/83, C/Ann Arbor/l/SO, C/ Great Lake/1167/54 have 1 site. The positions of Hind111 restriction sites are 986, 994 or 1052 and/or 1562, 1570 or 1628. When cDNA of C/JHB/ l/66 was submitted to PCR with C/10/1-C/2046/2, the length of the undigested PCR product was 2029 bp (sd = 12.5 bp), which is in accordance with the sequence data (Table 2 ). After digestion, 3 bands were generated: 1069 bp (sd = 12.5 bp), 559 bp (sd = 12.5 bp) and 367 bp (sd = 12.5 bp) instead of 1052 bp, 576 bp and 445 bp we expected as indicated in Table 5 . The electrophoreses were carried out on a submarine mini-gel and this may account for a lack of accuracy of measurement. As shown in Fig. 2 , lane 4, when HEF cDNA from G/Paris/145/91 was the template for PCR ( Table 4 ) the length of the undigested product was 2035 bp (sd = 20 bp) ( Table 2) . After digestion by HindIII, there were three bands of 1101 bp (sd = 20 bp), 561 bp (sd = 20 bp) and 362 bp (sd = 20 bp) as shown in Table 5 , the total of which being 2024 bp (k 60 bp). These findings are close to those for C/Hyogo/l/83, C/Kyoto/41/82 and C/Nara/82 (all Japanese strains) by analysis of their sequence as shown in Table 5 . No SacI, s&I, SmuI and X&I restriction sites existed in the full length HEF gene of C/JHB/1/66 as expected from the sequence as well as in any HEF gene of any INF-C sequenced so far including G/Paris/145/91 (Table 5) . As a consequence, the DNA amplified with the C/10/1-XbuIC/1918/2, C/10/1-XbuIC/2032/2 or C/10/1-S&C/2032/2 pairs of primers can be used for oriented cloning experiments in the polycloning sites of bacteriophage M 13mp19 and pSV-SPORT1 with little risk of encountering undesired restriction sites in an unknown strain. Digestions of bacteriophage M 13mp19 and pSV-SPORT1 with SmuI and XbuI can be carried out in the same incubation buffer and generate one blunt end and one cohesive end in the correct orientation. The DNA amplified with the C~lO~l-~~~C/2032/2 pair of primers (Fig. 2, lanes 67,  8) can also be cloned in both types of vectors using SmaI and Salf for digestions. The DNA amplitied with pairs of primers containing HindHI restriction sites such as HindIIIC/1918/2 cannot be used for cloning because of internal Hind111 sites in the gene of interest in C/Paris/l45/91.",

            "text": "There has been little interest in INF-C epidemiology and genetics and there is to date only one report concerning genie enzymatic ampli~cation or PCR applied to the HEF RNA this type of virus, but it was applied to a partial amplification of the gene of the laboratory strain C/JHB/l/66 (Szepanski et al., 1992) . As the virus itself requires specific means and efforts for isolation or detection, we believe that PCR can provide an easily available method and useful information about the real importance of INF-C as a pathogen. This would be an indispensable complement to sero-epidemiological surveys which have shown that INF-C is an agent of a widespread infection (Minuse et al., 1954; Dyke et al., 1980; O'Callaghan et al., 1980; Andrews and McDonald, 1955; Gerth et al., 1975; Jennings et al., 1968; Homma et al., 1982; Nishimura et al., 1987; Manuguerra et al., 1992) . The strain recently isolated in our laboratory (G/Paris/145/91) is a prime example that INF-C can cause a severe flu syndrome. This contradicts views widely held about the mild clinical expression of this virus based on a single study (Katagiri et al., 1983) in spite of rare reports dealing with acute and severe illness caused by INF-C (Andrews and McDonald, 1955; Librach, 1956; Gerber et al., 1952; Pead et al., 1985) . Detection alone is not sufficient and further detailed analyses such as sequence determination should be carried out. Moreover, the binding and enzymatic specificities of the HEF protein make INF-C a unique and powerful tool to study 9(4)-0-acetylated sialogiycoconjugates, much appreciated by biochemists. PCR experiments as described here carried out on the full length HEF gene enables direct sequencing or cloning of vRNA for expression experiments. Most binding properties and enzymatic characteristics of the esterase activity of TNF-C, described so far have been assessed on old strains whose passage history is unclear.",

We lack information about recent strains which have a very short passage history. PCR could help to increase our knowledge about the binding capacity of 'wild' INF-C, about the specificity of esterase activity and its possible role in pathogenesis. Isolation of INF-C can be carried out with high yields of virus on only a limited number of cell lines which display a sufficient amount of 9(4)-0-acetylated sialic acids on their surface, e.g. human melanoma cell lines (Nishimura et al., 1989; unpublished personal data). Human cancer cell lines are not usually used for isolation of INF-A and INF-B. The identification by haemagglutination inhibition test (HI) or by ELISA on membrane or on antibody coated plates relies on strict antibody specificity. According to our experience, and as anticipated, due to similar features between some coronaviruses and INF-C (Vlasak et al., 1988) , there is a wide serological cross-reactivity between INF-C and respiratory human coronaviruses with some monoclonal antibodies. This may be due to the large homology of aminoacid sequence of INF-C HEF and a coronavirus glycoprotein such as the HEX protein of mouse hepatitis virus .",

As shown in Table 1 , most of INF-C strains, whose HEF gene sequence has been analysed, can be aligned without any gaps and with a very low score of mismatch with all the primers specific for the 5' end of HEF gene. Three strains C/Nara/82, C/Kyoto/41/2 and C/Hyogo/83 can match only with EnzC/1918/2. C/Mississipi/80 matches with EnzC/1918/2 and C/2046/2. G/Taylor/1233/47, C/Yamagata/l0/83, G/England/892/83, C/Ann Arbor/l/SO, C/Great-Lakes/ 1167/54 and of course C/JHB/1/66, C/California/78 and G/Paris/145/91 matched perfectly with all the 11 primers mentioned above. These results indicate that the sets of primers for reverse transcription and PCR used in this work can be used for any strain of INF-C and among them particularly Uni l-EnzC/1918/2 and C/10/1-EnzC/1918/2.",

It is specific for the HA RNA segment of INF-A or for the HEF RNA segment of INF-C. The PCR, which followed reverse transcription, was also type-specific since cDNA of A/PR/8/34 as well as C/JHB/1/66 and G/Paris/145/91 synthesised with Unil were not amplified with primers specific for INF-C HEF gene or INF-A(H lN1) HA gene respectively. No cross-amplification was observed when the cDNA of A/PR/8/34 or C/JHB/1/66 and G/Paris/145/91 were synthesised with a primer specific for the 4th segment of INF-A and INF-C respectively. Since the universal primer Unil can be used to prime the synthesis of cDNA of any influenza virus, a unique reverse transcription mixture with a single primer is sufficient. As PCR is type-specific (according to the above results) and even sub-type specific (Robertson et al., in press), a cocktail of pairs of primers specific for A(HlNl), A(H3N2), B and C viruses can potentially be used for synthesis of fragments with different sizes. This would allow detection and identification of any influenza A, B but also C virus in a single test and would be particularly useful for epidemiological studies.",

The reason may be due to size and thus to a longer synthesis of the HEF target which the Taq polymerase could not complete as efficiently. Since the aim of this work was not only detection, the length of the amplified cDNA was dehberately not shortened. In order to express a soluble form of HEF, thus easily available in a eukaryotic expression system, we also ampli~ed the part of the sequence coding for an anchorless protein. The target was the region of the HEF gene which extends from the signal peptide to the beginning of the hydrophobic stretch that transverses the lipid bilayer of the envelope. The sequence of the primers have been determined according to that of C/.IHB/1/66 (Pfeiffer and Compans, 1984) and ~~California~78 (Nakada et al., 1984) . Two stop codons have been built into these primers. The expected protein would lack the proximal stretch of hydrophobic residues and the anchor to the membrane protein.",

Only 11 have been published so far, although interest in INF-C has progressively increased during the past 6 years. This shows the necessity of developing studies about this virus. The number of INF-C strains isolated during the winter 1990. --1991 (35 detections, 4 isolations), which is the highest ever obtained in our laboratory, contrasts with that of INF-B and A strains isolated during the same period of time: 204 (202 INF-B, 2 INF-A(H3N2)) (unpublished results). Unfortunately we could not perform any experiment directly on clinical samples, because of shortage of original virus material. For this reason we worked with stock virus which had undergone only 2 passages in eggs. We chose 4 restriction sites which are not present in the HEF genes already sequenced. They are present and correctly oriented in the cloning and expression vectors we intend to use. The occurrence of the Hind111 restriction site was studied because it is one of the variable sites in INF-C strains. The primers published in this report (~~~1~~2032~2, XbaIC/ 1918/Z, SalIC/2032/2, SuZIC/l918/2) are likely to be suitable for the amplification and cloning of any INF-C.
