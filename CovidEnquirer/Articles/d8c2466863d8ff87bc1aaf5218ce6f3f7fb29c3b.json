            "text": "Social experiences are an important predictor of disease susceptibility and survival in humans and other social mammals. Chronic social stress is thought to generate a proinflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-\u03baBdependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-\u03baB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history -in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.",

This relationship is thought to arise in part through changes in gene regulation, which mediate the genomic response to physiological signals of social stress (e.g., glucocorticoids, adrenaline, noradrenaline; (6, 7) ). Gene expression signatures of social status and social adversity have now been reported in multiple studies, encompassing clinical and population-based samples in humans, and studies of both experimental and natural populations in other social animals (6, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (see also (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) for evidence in social insects and other social vertebrates). Because this work has concentrated most extensively on peripheral white blood cells, it provides a direct window into how social experiences are reflected in the regulation of the immune system (26) (27) (28) .",

First, high social adversity, including social isolation, early life insults, and low social status in adulthood, tends to predict higher expression of genes in pro-inflammatory pathways. This observation dovetails with associations between chronic social stress and elevated levels of protein biomarkers of inflammation, including those produced by peripheral blood cells (e.g., interleukin-6; (13, 29, 30) ). Second, high social adversity tends to predict lower expression of genes that function in the innate immune defense against virus, especially genes involved in type I interferon (IFN) signaling. In most cases, this pattern has been shown based on data in unstimulated cells (6) ; however, in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells, induction of type I IFN-associated gene expression responses are also attenuated in low status (compared to high status) rhesus macaques (18) . Third, these findings are explained in part by socially patterned differences in the use of immune defense-modulating transcription factors. For example, genes that are more highly expressed in low status female rhesus macaques are enriched near accessible binding sites for the transcription factor complex nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), a master regulator of inflammation. In contrast, genes that are more highly expressed in high status females fall near accessible binding sites for interferon regulatory factors, which coordinate type I IFN-mediated responses (18, 31) .",

Such a model argues that high social adversity shifts investment in the immune system towards resistance against bacterial pathogens and wound healing (possibly in anticipation of physical insults), at the cost of increased susceptibility to viral pathogens. This in turn accounts for both social gradients in conditions linked to chronic inflammation, such as cardiovascular disease, and social gradients in viral infections. Consistent with this hypothesis, psychosocial stress predicts reactivation rates of latent herpesvirus in mice and humans (33, 34) and rates of respiratory virus infection for experimentally exposed human subjects (35, 36) . Similarly, low status cynomolgus macaques males housed in a controlled environment experience both increased susceptibility to experimentally administered adenovirus and elevated rates of coronary artery stenosis (35, 37, 38) .",

            "text": "Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether social patterning of viral susceptibility is directly related to social patterning of gene expression in peripheral blood cells. In particular, increased susceptibility to virus has been suggested to occur because the trade-offs induced by social adversity lead to insufficient production of antiviral gene transcripts (32) . This logic is largely based on lower expression levels for key antiviral genes (e.g., MX1, OAS family genes, interferon regulatory factors) measured at baseline. However, exposure to immune stimulants can radically change the transcriptional landscape of immune cells, and social environmental effects on gene expression have been shown to specifically depend on the cellular environment. For example, in rhesus macaque females, social status has more pronounced effects on gene expression after exposure to LPS, but weaker effects on gene expression after exposure to glucocorticoids (18, 31) . Because no study to date has evaluated the effects of social adversity on gene expression after both bacterial and viral challenge, it is therefore unclear whether chronic social stress in fact attenuates the gene regulatory response to virus, consistent with a trade-offs model. In addition, although increased expression of inflammation-related genes and decreased expression of type I IFN-related genes have been associated with social adversity in both adulthood and early life (9, 13, 18, 39) but see (40), we do not yet understand how the timing of social experiences affects the response to either pathogen type.",

This model takes advantage of the highly hierarchical social structure of female macaques, in which low rank predicts increased harassment and reduced social control, and combines it with the ability to manipulate rank via controlled introduction into newly formed social groups (earlier introduced females are higher ranking) (41, 42) . Using this study design, we previously showed that social status effects on blood cell gene expression are pervasive, cell typespecific, and dependent on the cellular environment: most relevant to this study, they can be substantially altered by bacterial stimulation (18) . Importantly, we also demonstrated that serial manipulations of dominance rank are possible. Specifically, by rearranging group composition a second time and placing females of previously similar rank into the same social group, the same individuals can be observed when they occupy two distinct positions in the social status hierarchy. Because pre-and post-rearrangement social status are completely uncorrelated, this approach provides an ideal setting to investigate the relative contributions of past versus present social environment to immune gene regulation.",

As expected from this experimental paradigm (42) , earlier introduction predicted higher social status in both phases, as measured by a continuous Elo rating score (Pearson's r between order of introduction and Elo score: Phase I: \u22120.57, p = 4.1 x 10 -5 ; Phase II: -0.68, p =3.3 x 10 -7 ). Importantly, once dominance ranks were established, they remained highly stable throughout each study phase, and individual Elo scores were completely uncorrelated between phases (r=0.06, p=0.68, SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ).",

We generated three gene expression profiles per animal, from: (i) a control (untreated) sample, with blood cultured in cell culture media only (negative control, NC); (ii) a sample cultured in cell culture media spiked with LPS, a Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist that mimics infection by Gram-negative bacteria; and (iii) a sample cultured in cell culture media spiked with Gardiquimod (Gard), a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist that mimics infection by a single-stranded RNA virus. We incubated samples from each individual for 4 hours in parallel, lysed the white blood cell fraction, and generated RNA-sequencing data from the matched non-stimulated and stimulated conditions. To confirm successful immune stimulation, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the correlation matrix of normalized gene expression levels for all conditions, after controlling for relatedness, age, and the potential confounding effects of batch and tissue composition ( Fig. 1B ; SI Appendix, Material and Methods). We observed distinct clusters corresponding to the control, LPS-stimulated, and Gard-stimulated samples, with treatment effects most clearly reflected along PC1 (r=0.61, p=6.5 x 10 -10 for the separation between control versus LPS samples) and PC4 (r=0.76, p=1.7 x 10 -17 for the separation between control versus Gard samples).

            "text": "Consistent with previous findings (18, 19, 34) , we also observed a strong signature of dominance rank. Specifically, dominance rank (Elo score) was significantly correlated with PC3 of the full gene expression matrix within all three conditions (Pearson's r = 0.75 (NC); r = 0.75 (LPS), r = 0.69 (Gard), p<6.0 x 10 -7 for all conditions; SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). This observation translated to gene-level analyses, where dominance rank drove the expression of 3,675, 5,322 and 2,694 genes (FDR<5%) in the control, LPS, and Gard conditions, respectively (Fig. 1C , SI Appendix, Dataset S3). Strikingly, the number of rank-associated genes in the LPS condition was 1.5 -2x higher than in the Gard or control conditions. Thus, although rank effects are amplified after activation of the bacterial-sensing TLR4 pathway, this pattern does not appear to be a universal feature of immune activation. Indeed, the number of genes for which the intensity of the response (i.e., gene expression in LPS/Gard conditions, relative to paired control samples) depended on dominance rank was almost fivefold lower in the viral Gard condition than for the bacterial LPS-stimulated samples (851 vs 4,111; FDR < 0.05; Fig. 2A ). Further, while 73% of rank effects on the LPS response were directionally biased towards larger responses in low status females, neither low nor high status systematically predicted stronger responses to Gard. Instead, rank effects on the response to Gard were almost perfectly balanced: 49.5% of rank-dependent genes exhibited a stronger response in low status animals, while 51.5% exhibited a stronger response in high status animals (Fig. 2B) .",

            "text": "To investigate the hypothesis that social status-induced stress mediates trade-offs between antibacterial and antiviral responses, we restricted our analysis to genes belonging to the Gene Ontology categories that were most enriched among genes up-regulated by LPS, Gard, or both. As we showed in previous analyses (18) , genes involved in immune defense, inflammation and cytokine signaling are biased towards higher expression in low-ranking females, in LPS condition samples (Fig. 2C) . In contrast, genes involved in viral defenseassociated type I IFN signaling are biased towards higher expression in high-ranking females, in the same condition (Fig. 2C) . A trade-offs model would predict a similar dichotomy after challenge with a viral mimic. Surprisingly, this is not what we observed: in the Gard condition, low status predicted increased expression of both proinflammatory/cytokine signaling-associated and type I IFN-associated genes. For example, for rank-associated genes in the Gene Ontology category \"type I interferon signaling\" 57% of genes measured in the LPS condition were more highly expressed in high status females. However, for rank-associated genes in the same category, measured in the Gard condition, only 25% were more highly expressed in high status females. Consequently, status-related effects for type I IFN genes differ significantly between LPS and Gard conditions (Wilcoxon test, p=6.4 x 10 -4 ). This pattern holds for key viral defense genes such as OAS2 and OAS3, which are involved in inhibition of viral replication; the IFN-inducible genes IFIT2, IFIT3, MX1 and MX2; and STAT1, a master regulator of interferon-mediated defense (Fig. 2D) . It also extends to measures of the response to immune challenge (i.e., the change in gene expression levels between control and challenged cells): genes involved in type I IFN signaling tend to be more strongly up-regulated in high status females after LPS challenge, but more strongly up-regulated in low status females after Gard challenge (SI Appendix, Fig.  S3 )",

As previously reported (18) , genes that were more highly expressed in low status animals were enriched for NF-\u03baB binding sites in the LPS condition. In contrast, genes that were more highly expressed in high status animals were enriched for predicted TF binding sites for interferon regulatory factors (IRF1, IRF2, and IRF7) and STAT1-the masterregulators of anti-viral responses (Fig. 3) . Strikingly, that dichotomy disappeared when samples were stimulated with a viral mimic. In the Gard condition, the promoter regions of genes that were more highly expressed in low status animals were enriched for TF binding sites for virtually all immune-associated TFs, including NF-\u03baB, several IRFs, and STAT1 (Fig. 3) . These results corroborate our enrichment analyses for the gene expression data alone (Fig. 2C) , and suggest that differences in TF activity account for the distinct patterns of social status-associated gene expression after LPS versus Gard stimulation.",

This pattern is highly robust across statistical thresholds (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). Genes associated with past rank were also enriched for distinct biological functions (SI Appendix, Dataset S2). For example, in the unstimulated controls, genes that were more highly expressed in high status animals at the time of sampling were strongly enriched for viral transcription (FDR-corrected p=2.8 x 10 -11 ) and viral gene expression (FDR-corrected p=5.5 x 10 -11 ). However, genes associated with past rank were not overrepresented in either category. Similarly, genes that were more highly expressed in females with a past history of high status were uniquely enriched in categories involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including chromatin organization (FDRcorrected p=4.8 x 10 -11 ), and histone modification (FDR-corrected p=3.6 x 10 -7 ) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5, Dataset S2) .",

We defined \u0398 as the square root of the ratio between the variance in gene expression explained by current rank, and the total variance explained by both past and current rank (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods). \u0398 values range from 0 to 1, where values close to 1 imply a high degree of plasticity and little evidence of memory, and values close to 0 imply a high degree of memory and little plasticity in response to changes in social status. Overall, we identified a much greater contribution of social history to gene expression levels in the unstimulated control samples than in either of the stimulated conditions (control: median \u0398 for the top 1000 rank-associated genes in NC = 0.52; LPS = 0.87; Gard = 0.74; Wilcoxon test p<2.2 x 10 -16 for all pairwise comparisons; Fig 4B; see also SI Appendix, Fig. S6 for comparisons using different numbers of rank-associated genes). In agreement with this observation, social status effects on the response to LPS and Gard (i.e., the interaction between Elo score and control versus stimulated treatment) were dominated by the effects of current rank. We identified 4,111 and 851 genes for which the response to LPS and Gard, respectively, depended on dominance rank at the time of sampling (FDR<5%), but no cases in which these responses depended on past rank. Thus, although there is a strong signature of social history on gene expression levels in an unperturbed state, this signature gives way to the effects of current social conditions when cells enter an immune-challenged state.",

We therefore tested if past and current rank combined non-additively to influence gene expression. In the control condition, where the effects of social history are most pronounced, we identified 1,079 genes in which past and current rank interacted to influence gene expression (FDR<5%). Interaction effects were strongly directionally biased: specifically, for 88% of these genes, a history of past low status predicted reduced sensitivity to current dominance rank ( Fig. 4C and 4D) . Thus, females who fell in rank were strongly affected by their current, lower rank in Phase II, whereas females who achieved higher status in Phase II were proportionally more affected by their lower status in Phase I. Fig. S6 ). Plasticity scores are systematically lower in the unstimulated control samples (NC) than in the LPS or Gard conditions, indicating that immune stimulation proportionally weakens social history effects, relative to current rank effects. (D) In an example of a current rank x past rank interaction, current rank effects (x-axis) on expression of the transcription factor FOSL1, which is implicated in regulation of the type I IFN response (47) , are strongest in females who were previously high rank and weakest in females who were previously low rank (interaction=0.54, FDR-corrected p=0.01). (E) Predicted current rank effects, based on model fits for each gene on the full data set (see SI Appendix, Materials and Methods), for low past rank and high past rank females (based on the mean Elo scores for the lowest ranking and highest ranking females in Phase I groups, respectively). Distributions show estimated effect sizes across 1,079 genes for which we identified a significant current rank-past rank interaction effect in the control condition. Current rank effects were systematically larger in females who were previously high-ranking than in females who were previously low-ranking (Wilcoxon test p<2.2x10 -16 ).",

Our findings join those of others to suggest that social adversity is particularly relevant to the inflammatory response, one of the first lines of defense in the innate immune system (49) . Because biomarkers of inflammation in turn predict disease and mortality outcomes (50), these findings suggest that social regulation of immune gene expression may partly mediate social gradients in health. However, contrary to current predictions based on data collected in unstimulated conditions, low status females did not mount attenuated gene regulatory responses to viral challenge (6, 32) . Instead, they show a stronger up-regulation of genes involved in the regulation of type I IFN when comparing Gard to control samples. Further, for these genes, the status-dependent polarization of gene expression patterns observed following exposure to a bacteriaassociated challenge disappears following exposure to a virus-associated challenge.",

Thus, while the gene expression signature of social stress may be somewhat conserved across different types of social adversity, and potentially across species, it does not appear to be highly conserved across pathogen environments. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that social status interacts with LPS and glucocorticoid exposure (18, 31) , and that genetic effects on gene expression can also be altered by local cellular conditions (i.e., gene-environment interactions, e.g., (51) (52) (53) (54) ). However, while prior work has primarily shown environment or genotype-dependent differences in the presence or magnitude of effects, here we observed a more striking pattern: directional shifts in the effects of social status, specifically for genes involved in the antiviral response. This reversal of effects suggests that social status-sensitive regulatory elements involved in the response to LPS are, at least to some degree, distinct from social status-sensitive regulatory elements involved in the response to Gard -a hypothesis that requires further experimental validation.",

Specifically, we identified thousands of genes for which gene expression levels in peripheral blood cells depend not only on current social status, but also on the effects of past social status. Social history effects were themselves dependent on other factors, however, with much more extensive effects in unstimulated cells than immunechallenged cells, and in females with a history of low status than for females with a history of high status. These observations are consistent with several possibilities. First, a history of high social status (i.e., low social adversity) could confer increased plasticity in response to environmental change (e.g., subsequent losses of status). Second, historical exposure to social subordination-induced stress could blunt responses to future high-quality environments. Third, social history effects may dissipate over time, but at a faster pace for formerly high status females. Given that the effects of current rank dominate after immune stimulation, external environmental challenges might hasten this process. Longitudinal, repeated measures of gene expression will be needed to differentiate between these possibilities.",

They therefore extend the concept of biological embedding to adulthood, in keeping with the observation that the molecular mechanisms thought to mediate the embedding process early in life (e.g., DNA methylation, histone marks) remain environmentally sensitive across the life course. The mechanism of memory in this case may differ from cases of biological embedding that persist over years or decades. For example, memory T cells, which can represent up to 40% of total circulating T cells in adulthood (55) , can survive in the body for years, raising the possibility that slow turnover of some PBMC subsets could be responsible for the social history effects we observed. However, recent evidence suggests that even shortlived cells in the innate immune system-which canonically has been thought to lack memory-can be epigenetically altered by environmental experience (56) .",

If temporally separate exposures independently tap into the same gene regulatory mechanisms, then the genome can be viewed as a mosaic, in which some loci retain more of a long-term signature of social history than others. This perspective is consistent with studies of organism-level traits. For example, in nonhuman primate models of social stress, behavioral signatures of status are highly plastic with changes in dominance rank, whereas the development of coronary artery plaques are explained by the combination of present and past social status (59, 60) . A key contribution of genomic approaches rests in their ability to compare levels of plasticity across thousands of traits simultaneously.

Notably, although the type I IFN response is often discussed in opposition to pro-inflammatory, NF-\u03baB-mediated antibacterial responses, type I IFN signaling itself can also be pro-inflammatory (61) . High reactivity to both viral and bacterial ligands may therefore represent two distinct sources of elevated inflammation in low status individuals.

All study subjects were initially drawn from the YNPRC breeding colony, assigned to five-member social groups in January -June 2013, and behaviorally monitored to assess social status in February 2013 -March 2014 (Phase I). Group membership was rearranged in March -June 2014 (start of Phase II) by cohousing females of the same or adjacent ordinal ranks in Phase I in the same Phase II groups. This approach allowed us to observe all possible between-phase changes in ordinal dominance rank and produced completely uncorrelated individual ranks between phases (r=0.06, p=0.68), thus enabling us to separate the effects of rank at sampling from rank social history.",

The major source of batch effects across conditions arises from differences in the timing of library prep and sequencing for the Gard samples, relative to the NC and LPS samples (which were prepped and sequenced together). Because condition is completely collinear with this source of batch effects, we cannot correct for it in our data analysis. Importantly, this issue does not impact our estimation of rank effects within NC, LPS, or Gard data sets, which are the effects of primary interest for this study. It could, however, impact the identity and magnitude of our estimates for genes that are differentially expressed in response to Gard stimulation (i.e., when we compare NC to Gard data collected from the same individuals). Reassuringly, gene set enrichment analysis shows that genes we identified as responsive to Gard are strongly enriched for pathways involved in antiviral responses (e.g., response to cytokine: FDRcorrected p=2.4x10 -6 ; type I interferon signaling pathway: FDR-corrected p=1.2x10 -5 ; cellular response to interferon gamma: FDR-corrected p=3.1x10 -5 ; SI Appendix, Dataset S2).
