However, the complexity of SeV virion antigen limits the accuracy of the diagnostic method. In the current study, complete SeV virion antigen was separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed, with nucleocapsid protein (NP) showing predominant antigenicity. A peptide array containing overlapping 14-mer peptides covering the entire NP was developed. The array used SeV positive serum and resulted in four antigenic linear peptides being identified, which were located in the carboxyl-terminus of NP. The four peptides were coated on ELISA plates and tested with SeV positive and SeV negative sera, and the antigenicity of three peptides, NP413-428, NP473-490 and NP507-524, was confirmed. Mixture of the three peptides showed comparable sensitivity and better specificity in clinical rat sera ELISA tests compared with complete SeV virion antigen. In conclusion, the three peptides, NP413-428, NP473-490 and NP507-524, would be good candidates as linear antigens for SeV detection.",

Three weeks after infection, 20 rats were euthanised with a sodium pentobarbital overdose after blood collection. The sera of rats were confirmed as being SeV positive by ELISA.

Negative control serum had no significant avidity on ELISA plates. Positive serum reactivity was more than five times higher than negative serum reactivity on peptide NP413-428-, NP473-490-and NP507-524-coated ELISA plates; although positive serum reactivity on peptide-coated ELISA plates was lower than complete virions. The specific avidity of SeV positive serum was not detectable on peptide NP449-468-coated plates. Sequentially diluted positive and negative control sera were also tested on peptide NP413-428-, NP473-490-and NP507-524-coated plates (Fig. 3B-D) . Absorbance values significantly decreased as positive serum was diluted sequentially on all peptide-coated plates. Reaction values slightly decreased as negative serum dilution increased. All negative serum values were lower than 0.1 at OD450. To explore the applicability of these peptide antigens, a mixture of peptide NP413-428, NP473-490 and NP507-524 was coated on the same wells of an ELISA plate. Seventeen clinical sera samples were tested using the peptide mixture-coated plate and a SeV virion-coated plate (Fig. 4) . Absorbance values of samples 3, 4, 6 and 7 on the SeV virion-coated plate were higher than the cut-off value, which was set by negative serum on the SeV virion-coated plate. Absorbance values of these four samples from the peptide mixture-coated plate were also higher than the cut-off value. Four of the 17 samples were determined as being SeV antibody-positive by the complete virion-or the peptide mixture-coated ELISA plates.

The antigenicity of three of the peptides was confirmed. Although overlapping peptides for amino acids 449-468 of NP had higher avidity with SeV positive serum, synthesized NP449-468 failed to show antigenicity in ELISA tests. NP449-468 also failed to show antigenicity in repeated experiments. These results may be due to the antigenicity displayed of synthesized NP449-468 on coated ELISA plates differing from the overlapping peptides synthesized directly on the membrane.",

A SeV NP sequence comparative analysis was performed by DELTA-BLAST in a non-redundant protein sequences database (Boratyn et al., 2012) . The homologous sequence of SeV NP is also found in NP from the following viruses: Human parainfluenza virus, Bovine parainfluenza virus, Simian Agent 10, Mossman virus, Cedar virus, Canine distemper virus, Nariva virus, Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus, Measles virus, Rinderpest virus and Tailam virus. The homologous sequence of SeV NP is located mainly at amino acids 1-350. In the current study, all three linear antigenic peptides found were located in the carboxyl-terminus of SeV NP. The NP carboxyl-terminal sequence of SeV is comparably unique to SeV NP. SeV negative rat sera samples had lower avidity with the three peptides than SeV complete virions (Figs. 3 and 4) . Additionally, a mixture of these three peptides had no cross-reaction with mouse hepatitis virus, rat corona virus or sialodacryoadenitis virus, the most prevalent pathogens affecting mice and rats (data not shown). The results suggest that the three peptides identified may be SeV-specific epitopes, and possibly have better specificity for SeV in serological detection.",

The absorbance values of sera samples have already omitted the absorbance value of the blank well. The cut-off value was set by the absorbance value of SeV negative control serum from SeV complete virion-coated plates +0.15. The absorbance values of samples 3, 4, 6 and 7 are higher than the cutoff value, both from the SeV complete virion-coated plate and the peptide mixturecoated plate.",
