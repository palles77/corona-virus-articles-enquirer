The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was",

            "text": "Wuhan, a large city with 14 million residents and a major air and train transportation hub of central China, identified a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia on December 29, 2019 1 . Four patients were initially reported and all these initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market 2 . Chinese health authorities and scientists did immediate investigation and isolated a novel coronavirus from these patients by January 7, 2020, which is then named as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization 3, 4 . 2019-nCoV can cause acute respiratory diseases that progress to severe pneumonia 5 . The infection fatality risk is around 3% estimated from the data of early outbreak 3, 6 . Information on new cases strongly indicates human-to-human spread 1, 7, 8 . Infection of 2019-nCoV quickly spread to other cities in China and other countries ( Figure 1 ). It becomes an event of global health concern 9 . Up to February 11, 2020, according to the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, all prefecturelevel cities of mainland China have confirmed cases and the total number reaches to 42667, of whom 1016 have died and 4242 recovered; 24 oversea countries have 398 confirmed cases (1 died). Chinese government took great effort to control the spread of disease, including closing the public transportation from and to Wuhan on January 23, extending the Spring Festival holiday, postponing the school-back day, and suspending all domestic and international group tours. Unfortunately, many external factors bring a challenge to control virus spreading. First, it might be already late to stop the migration of infected cases. Evidence suggests that Wuhan is the center of 2019-nCoV outbreak 1, 10 . However, around 5 million Wuhan residents left Wuhan in January 2020 due to the Spring Festival (January 24, 2020). It is very likely that a considerable number of infected cases have moved from Wuhan to other cities before Wuhan government implemented border control on January 23. Second, it is highly possible that infected cases spread the virus to their family members or relatives 7 . A study based on 425 patients at the early stage of outbreak revealed that the time from infection to illness onset is 5.2 days 1 . As a result, presymptomatic cases who have left Wuhan may not be isolated themselves from their family and relatives 11 . Third, due to the sudden outbreak of virus, the preparation and resources for preventing virus transmission are limited. The protective equipment in many hospitals in Wuhan was in short supply so that it is difficult to maintain strict personal hygiene. With the quick increase of infected cases, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province have large pressure to isolate and give medical treatment to infected people. All above factors make preventing the spread of 2019-nCoV even more difficult than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus outbreak in China 17 years ago that caused more than 8000 infections and 800 deaths.",

Right after the outbreak, several studies have retrieved the epidemiological parameters and predicted the future situation [12] [13] [14] [15] . These studies used the reported cases at the early stage of outbreak and modeled epidemic dynamics in Wuhan and nation-wide. A recent study 10 used air passenger data and social medium data to forecast the spread of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan and other major Chinese cities. They estimated that 75815 individuals have been infected in Greater Wuhan as of January 25, 2020 and epidemics are already growing exponentially in major cities of China with a 1-2 weeks lag time behind Wuhan outbreak. Although these studies at the early stage of outbreak help us understand the key epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, the fine-scale and updated epidemic trend in individual Chinese cities remains unknown, which is more helpful for allocating medical resources to achieve the optimal result of preventing disease spreading.",

We modified the SIR structure based on the unique characteristics of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. First, in all cities other than Wuhan, the initial infectious cases are most likely imported from Wuhan 10 . Second, many Wuhan residents moved to other cities due to the Spring Festival and this mobility was closed after the quarantine on January 23. Third, those people from Wuhan have low contacts with local residents because Chinese government required them to implement self-isolation. Last, during the past 40 days, all cities took efforts to control the virus spreading, which slows down the daily increase of new infections ( Figure 1 ). Accordingly, in the modified SIR model, the susceptible variable was divided into two groups: 1 , the number of local susceptible, and 2 , the number of susceptible with Wuhan travel history. These Wuhan-inbound groups ( 2 ), have transmission rate ( 2 ) different from transmission rate ( 1 ) of local residents ( 1 ) as Chinese government took measures to reduce the person-to-person contacts. A decay rate a was introduced to tune the value of \u03b2 in each day, accounting for the gradual impact of prevention interventions in each city. In our modified SIR model, recovered population R was extended to include those cured, died, and isolated in hospital because they cannot transmit the virus.

The Nelder-Mead algorithm 17 was employed to estimate parameters through minimizing the sum of squared differences between the simulated and actual daily cumulative confirmed cases. To better capture the current trend, the number of daily cumulative cases were also used to weight the samples in parameter retrieval. Since the epidemic model is highly sensitive to the initial infectious number I0, and the reported initial infectious number often has large uncertainty, we treated the initial infectious number 0 as another parameter to be estimated together with 1 and 2 . Specifically, we used daily cumulative confirmed cases of each city from January 25 to February 10, 2020 to retrieve the parameters and assumed January 20, 2020 as the start point when massive inter-city mobility happened before the Spring Festival.

We examined the fitted models with R-squared less than 0.7 (26 out of 306 cities) and found that all these cities have very small number (1-3) of confirmed cases and the number does not change in the past several days. It is reasonable to assume that these cities have completely controlled the spreading and no new infected cases will emerge in the future. Therefore, for these cities with R-squared less than 0.70, the 1 value of the city was set to zero. Transmission rate 2 estimated using Wuhan confirmed cases is 0.9, reflecting a high transmission around January 20. The transmission rate 1 , decay rate a, and initial infectious population 0 vary from city to city (Supplementary data Table 3 ). As the transmission rate among local residents in each city, 1 reflects the intensity of control measures adopted by each local government at the beginning of outbreak, as well as the awareness of citizens to take protective measures. For example, 1 in megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are low ( Figure 5 .a) which may attribute to higher health literacy of their citizens 21 , although they have intensive traffic and population mobility. Decay rate a reflects the continuous effort input by each city to control the transmission of disease. It shows that decay rates of cities close to Wuhan is generally lower than other cities ( Figure 5 .b), suggesting the big challenge faced by these cities to control the disease spreading. ",

Our prediction shows that the whole mainland China will have 72172, 54348, and 149774 people infected up to March 12, 2020 under the above three scenarios respectively (Supplementary data Table 4 ). To provide an intuitive picture about epidemic dynamics in different scenarios, we showed in Figure 7 the number of cumulative infections in each city on March 12. The infected people will mainly distribute in the central and eastern provinces, the number of western cities at a relatively low level under all scenarios. In scenario 3 (Figure 7 .c), many cites have much larger number of infections than scenario 1 (Figure 7 .a) and 2 (Figure 7 .b), suggesting that work resuming will bring large challenge to control the disease timely. This difference is significant for those cities with largest number of infections by March 12 (Figure 8) , such as Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. To understand the specific attributes of epidemic dynamics under different scenarios, we investigated the temporal changes of daily new infections across all cities in mainland China. In Figure 9 , we show the results in Wuhan, Hubei province excluding Wuhan, other provinces, and four first-tier cities. Compared with the scenario 1 where current trend is maintained, the daily new infections in scenario 2 reduces quickly in the second half of February. In scenario 3 where transmissibility rebounds after the public holiday in all cities, the peak of new infections will postpone ten days and the magnitude will be twice of that in scenarios 1 and 2. Our simulation suggests that strict quarantine of inner-and inter-city population movement during February would have a significant effect on the suppression of virus spreading. Table 4 ) suggests that the exponential growing of disease will stop and the spreading would be controlled gradually. Under current trend, our model estimated that the number of new infections in 79.7% cities already reached the peak point before February 11 and in all other cities, it will reach the peak point by February 21. With the control effort expanded, all cities will have the peak point of new infections by February 14, one week earlier than current trend. However, the peak point of new infections will be greatly delayed under scenario 3 that a few cities in Hubei province will show the peak point of new infections by February 26.",

Generally speaking, densely populated cities and cities in central China will face severe pressure to control the epidemic, since the number of infections keeps increasing in all three scenarios in the near future. By comparing predictions of three scenarios, it is obvious that reducing the transmissibility is a critical approach to reduce the daily new infections and controlling the magnitude of epidemics. Fortunately, the latest number of confirmed diagnoses ( Figure 1 ) and our prediction both show the slowing down of new infections in these days, indicating current control measures implemented by Chinese government are effective, including controlling traffic between Wuhan and other regions, isolating suspected patients, canceling mass gatherings, and requiring people to implement protective measures. However, once the Spring Festival travel rush returns as scenario 3 (most provinces planned to resume work on February 9), it will inevitably cause considerable growth in transmissibility and further re-increase of epidemics. In addition, current insufficient supply of protective equipment may exacerbate this situation. Therefore, public health interventions should be performed continuously to obtain the best results of epidemic control. The following measures are recommended to implement continuously in the near future, such as, postponing work resuming, arranging work-from-home, and instructing enterprises to implement epidemic prevention measures. Essentially, all measures are for reducing population mobility and person-to-person contact, and there is no panacea for all conditions, hence interventions in different regions should be adapted according to local epidemics.",
