            "text": "We previously showed that erythropoietin (EPO) attenuates the morphological signs of spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in swine [1] without, however, improving neurological function. The clinical use of EPO has been cautioned most recently due to serious safety concerns arising from an increased mortality in acute stroke patients treated with EPO and simultaneously receiving systemic thrombolysis [2]. Carbamylated EPO (cEPO) is an EPO derivative without erythropoietic activity and devoid of the EPO side eff ects, but with apparently well maintained cytoprotective qualities [3]. We therefore tested the hypothesis whether cEPO may be equally effi cient as EPO in reducing morphological as well as functional aortic occlusion-induced spinal cord I/R injury. Methods In a randomized and blinded trial pigs received either vehicle (control, n = 9), EPO or cEPO, respectively (n = 9 each; 5,000 IU/kg over 30 minutes before and during the fi rst 4 hours of reperfusion). Animals underwent 30 minutes of thoracic aortic balloon occlusion with catheters placed immediately downstream of the A. subclavia and upstream of the aortic trifurcation. Spinal cord function was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEP as percentage of the amplitude before aortic occlusion) and lower limb refl exes (assessed as the subjective strength of response) for a period of 10 hours after reperfusion. Tissue damage was evaluated using Nissl staining. Results Both EPO-treated and cEPO-treated animals presented with attenuated spinal cord injury in the Nissl staining (median (quartile) percentage of damaged neurons in the thoracic segments: control 27 (25,44), cEPO 8 (4,10), and EPO 5 (5,7), P <0.001 vs control group; in the lumbar segments: control 26 (19,32), cEPO 7 (5,13), EPO 8 (5,10), P <0.001 vs control group). However, while only cEPO treatment was associated with recovery of the MEP amplitude to pre-occlusion values when compared with the control group (P <0.05), lower limb refl ex response was comparably restored stronger in both treatment groups (P <0.05 vs control). Conclusions In a clinically relevant porcine model mimicking aortic crossclamping during vascular surgery repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm, cEPO protected spinal cord function and integrity as eff ective as EPO when applied at equipotent doses.

Therefore, we investigated the metabolic eff ects of inhaled H 2 S in our model of resuscitated murine septic shock. Methods Sixteen hours after induction of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation, anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice received 100 ppm H 2 S or vehicle over 5 hours at body temperatures of 38 and 27\u00b0C, respectively. During the observation period, hyperdynamic hemodynamics were maintained by colloid resuscitation and noradrenaline infusion [5]. Endogenous glucose production was calculated from blood 13 C6-glucose isotope enrichment derived from the rate of appearance of stable, non-radioactive labeled 1,2,3,4,5,6-13 C6 glucose during continuous isotope infusion [6]. Whole-body glucose oxidation rate was derived from the total CO 2 -production rate, the mixed expiratory 13 CO 2 / 12 CO 2 isotope ratio and the 13 C6-glucose infusion rate after the steady state was achieved. Results While endogenous glucose production was not aff ected by hypothermia, it was signifi cantly higher in the septic animals when compared with the corresponding sham operated groups, most likely due to the ongoing noradrenaline infusion. In contrast, despite the catecholamine infusion and higher glucose release, whole body glucose oxidation was signifi cantly reduced in normothermic septic animals. During hypothermia, H 2 S shifted substrate towards preferential glucose utilisation, but this eff ect disappeared in the septic mice. Conclusions H 2 S inhalation alone does not infl uence glucose metabolism once temperature is maintained at normothermic levels in anesthetised and mechanically ventilated mice. The H 2 S-related shift of energy metabo lism towards preferential carbohydrate oxidation present during hypothermia is blunted during sepsis, possibly as a result of the ongoing catecholamine treatment.",

            "text": "Introduction Unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated apoptosis plays a pivotal role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) has been reported to act as a chemical chaperone inhibiting UPR-mediated apoptosis triggered by ischemia in various organs other than the heart. Therefore we investigated whether PBA reduces UPR-mediated apoptosis and protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. Methods C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 30 minutes LAD ischemia followed by reperfusion. PBA (100 mg/kg) or PBS (control) was administrated intraperitoneally just before ischemia. Apoptosis, infarct size and tissue protein levels of Grp78 and caspase-12 (UPR-mediated apoptosisassociated protein) were evaluated by TUNEL, TTC stain and western blot analyses, respectively, at 48 hours after ischemia (n = 5 for each group). Echocardiography was performed at 3 weeks after ischemia and the survival ratio was observed (n = 9 for each group). Results Compared with PBS, PBA reduced apoptotic cells (30.8 \u00b1 0.2% vs 20.5 \u00b1 0.5%, P <0.05) and infarct size (32.0 \u00b1 3.8% vs 13.0 \u00b1 2.1%, P <0.01) after ischemia-reperfusion. Grp78 and caspase-12 were increased in mice with PBS, but PBA attenuated the increase in Grp78 (P <0.05) and caspase-12 (P <0.05). PBA inhibited the deterioration of cardiac parameters including LVEDD (3.35 \u00b1 0.08 mm vs 2.74 \u00b1 0.11 mm, P <0.01), LVESD (2.30 \u00b1 0.08 mm vs 1.54 \u00b1 0.12 mm, P <0.01), and %FS (31.3 \u00b1 2.2% vs 39.4 \u00b1 2.2%, P <0.05). All mice with PBA survived, but 33% animals with PBS died. Conclusions PBA maintained cardiac function and improved survival ratio after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion by reducing UPR-mediated apoptosis in mice. References Introduction In awake, spontaneously breathing mice, inhaling hydrogen sulfi de (H 2 S) induced a hibernation-like metabolic state characterised by reduced energy expenditure and hypothermia [1] , which protected against otherwise lethal hypoxia [2] and hemorrhage [3] . In contrast, other authors reported that inhibition of endogenous H 2 S synthesis attenuated posthemorrhage organ dysfunction [4, 5] . All these data originate, however, from unresuscitated models using a pre-treatment design. Therefore we investigated the time-dependent eff ect of intravenous H 2 S in a clinically relevant, long-term model of porcine hemorrhage and resuscitation. Methods After surgical instrumentation, pigs were subjected to 4 hours of hemorrhagic shock induced by removal of 40% of the calculated blood volume and thereafter by additional removal or retransfusion of blood boli as needed to maintain MAP = 30 mmHg. Animals randomly received vehicle (control, n = 14) or the intravenous H 2 S donor Na 2 S started 2 hours before hemorrhage (pre-treatment, n = 11), at the beginning of blood removal (early post-treatment, n = 10) or at the beginning of resuscitation (late post-treatment, n = 10). In all groups the Na 2 S infusion was continued over the fi rst 10 hours of reperfusion. Resuscitation comprised retransfusion of shed blood, colloid volume expansion, and noradrenaline titrated to keep MAP at pre-shock levels. Systemic, renal and liver perfusion, O 2 exchange, and organ function were assessed before and at the end of hemorrhage as well as at 10 and 22 hours of resuscitation. Results Survival (71% in the control vs 100, 91, and 90% in the pretreatment, early post-treatment and late post-treatment groups, respectively) was signifi cantly improved in all treatment groups. The noradrenaline infusion rate required to maintain hemodynamic targets was signifi cantly reduced in the early post-treatment group only, which coincided with a progressive drop in core temperature and attenuated kidney dysfunction (blood creatinine levels, creatinine clearance) in these animals. Conclusions Na 2 S application improved survival regardless of the drug timing. The less benefi cial eff ect of pre-treatment on organ function may be due to the higher total amount of drug infused, possibly suggesting some toxicity at these doses.",

Most of these animal studies have had high baseline mortality and have not employed standardised management of sepsis as usually provided in an ICU. The aim of this study was to develop a large animal model of septic shock receiving standardised intensive care management, thus replicating the management of septic shock in humans. Methods Eleven Marino ewes (weight 60 to 70 kg, hemiazygous vein ligated) were anaesthetised and had radiological guided catheters inserted into the iliac, renal, and hepatic veins, coronary sinus, and the pulmonary and carotid arteries. Tracheostomy tubes were inserted and the animals mechanically ventilated while supported in a sling. Six sheep were administered intravenous E. coli (ATCC 25922) 1.0 x 10 8 orgs/kg over 1 hour (septic sheep), fi ve received placebo (nonseptic sheep). For 24 hours, animals were monitored and received sedation (midazolam + ketamine), ventilation, fl uids and inotropes according to a protocol. Primary end-point was noradrenaline (NA) dose to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 75 mmHg. Secondary end-points included haemodynamic variables, respiratory, hepatic, and renal function, haematology, acid-base status and global, hind-limb, renal, hepatic and coronary oxygen extraction ratio (OER). Results Sheep were successfully instrumented, monitored and supported for 24 hours. Septic sheep required NA (mean dose 0.28 \u03bcg/kg/min vs 0.00, P <0.001), developed a higher cardiac index (6.6 l/m 2 vs 4.3, P <0.05) and lower SVRI (769 dynes/m 2 vs 1,804, P <0.05). At 24 hours, septic sheep had renal impairment (creatinine 286 mmol/l vs 76, P <0.05; urea 12 mmol/l vs 7, P <0.05), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.21 vs 7.39, P <0.05; lactate 10.9 mmol/l vs 1.2, P <0.01; pCO 2 32 vs 31, P = 0.63), coagulopathy (INR 5.9 vs 1.9, P <0.05; fi brinogen 0.9 g/l vs 2.7, P <0.05) but preserved respiratory and hepatic function. Global OER was lower in septic sheep (0.16 vs 0.29, P <0.05) as was coronary OER (0.36 vs 0.68, P <0.05). OER did not change with sepsis in the kidney (0.09 vs 0.11, P = 0.52), liver (0.24 vs 0.31, P = 0.48) and hind-limb (0.31 vs 0.42, P = 0.23). Conclusions We have developed a large animal model of septic shock that receives intensive care support and standardised management. This model replicates much of the pathophysiology and management that occurs in human septic shock. It allows a large range of physiological parameters to be assessed when investigating new therapies for sepsis.",

            "text": "Introduction Sepsis-induced lymphocyte apoptosis plays a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Recent animal models of sepsis have identifi ed anomalies in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, a key pathological occurrence in sepsis [1] . Specifi cally apoptosis markers such as caspases 1, 3, 8, 9 and FADD have been shown to be signifi cant in animal models of infection [2] .We investigated mRNA transcription of these markers in a human model of severe sepsis. We hypothesized that ICU mortality from severe sepsis is associated with distinctive gene expression of extrinsic apoptosis markers. Methods A prospective observational study of patients with severe sepsis was performed. Mononuclear cells were isolated from 48 patients with severe sepsis. Total RNA was extracted from samples for day 1 of admission and again on day 7. FADD, caspase 1, 3, 8, and 9 mRNA was quantifi ed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Standard demographic and outcome data were recorded. Between-group comparisons were performed by Wilcoxon rank sum test. All values are stated as median and interquartile range. Results Sixteen of the 48 patients died in the ICU. Caspase 9 mRNA copy numbers were signifi cantly increased on day 7 in the survivor group (5.4 x 10 6 ; 7.4 x 10 6 to 8.9 x 10 6 ) compared with death in the ICU group (1.9 x 10 6 ; 3.0 x 10 6 to 1.2 x 10 6 ) P = 0.001. FADD, caspase 1, 3 and 8 mRNA copy numbers were not signifi cantly diff erent between patients who died and those discharged from the ICU on either day 1 or day 7 of admission. Conclusions Caspase 9 may be an important regulator of apoptotic mechanisms in humans with late sepsis. Pro-apoptotic mechanisms may have a role in the resolution of severe sepsis. Conclusions Individual variability occurs in both faecal and zymosan peritonitis models as shown by heterogeneous clinical responses and local immune cell numbers to the same dose in similar animals. The cellular immune response in both models is consistent with current understanding of infection-induced infl ammation. Neutrophils, but not macrophages, rose in proportion to worsening clinical severity. The signifi cance of F4/80 + /GR-1 + cells in the FS model requires further evaluation.",

To study cytokine production, PMBC were cultured in the presence of PMA/ionomycin (50/750 ng/ml) in supplemented RPMI 1640 for 5 hours. Intracellular cytokines IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, IFN\u03b3 were stained in CD3 + /CD4 + , CD3 + /CD8 + cells using fl ow cytometry for both. The number of cytokine producing cells was compared with age/sex-matched healthy human volunteers. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. Results There were 12 patients (66 years old, six males, APACHE II-24, eight survivors) and nine volunteers. We found a relative increase in the frequency of Treg cells while the proportion of CD4 + cells remained unchanged in septic patients. The PMA/ionomycin lead to maximal T-cell stimulation, testing the ability of individual cell subsets to produce cytokines. Septic patients displayed reduction of IFN\u03b3 (10.5 \u00b1 0.8% vs 14.7 \u00b1 1.9%, P <0.01) and a tendency to higher number of IL-10 (1.7 \u00b1 0.3% vs 0.5 \u00b1 0.1%, P = 0.10) producing CD4 + cells, while the proportion of IFN\u03b3-positive CD8 + cells increased (42.8 \u00b1 5.8% vs 28.1 \u00b1 4.9%, P = 0.03). However, the overall CD8 + T-cell population was reduced (14.29 \u00b1 1.6% vs 25 \u00b1 1.2%) following ex vivo activation in patients. The number of IL-4 and IL-17 staining cells was unchanged ( Figure 1 ). Conclusions Our results confi rm a relative increase of Treg [1] and a skew towards Th2 lineage in the CD4 + cells. The highly activated CD8 + cells appear to be more susceptible to activation-induced cell death. Introduction It is currently being understood that most of the agents modulating host response in sepsis have failed because they act to refrain an over-exaggerated immune response whereas immunoparalysis takes place on the time of their administration. The eff ect of IFN\u03b3 on immunoparalysis of monocytes in sepsis was assessed. Introduction Nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Recently, we demonstrated that endothelial NOS (eNOS) contributes to endogenous NO-production and modulates infl ammation, associated with preserved cardiac function resulting in prolonged survival of eNOS -/compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The role of neuronal NOS (nNOS) in septic cardiomyopathy remains unclear. This study's aim is to elucidate the infl uence of nNOS in the presence/absence of eNOS on cardiac function and survival in a clinically relevant model of sepsis. Methods Inhibition of nNOS was achieved via continuous application of the selective nNOS-inhibitor Vinyl-L-NIO (VL-NIO) (0.02 mg/kg BW/hour) using an osmotic mini pump. B6/c57 WT and eNOS -/mice were rendered septic by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP). After 12 hours heart function was analyzed using a pressure-volume catheter placed in the left ventricle. For catecholamine responsiveness, norepinephrine was applied (0.4 \u03bcg/kg BW/minute, intraperitoneally). NOx-levels in plasma were measured using high-pressure performing liquid chromatography. Results Inhibition of nNOS via VL-NIO application resulted in signifi cantly reduced nitrate plasma levels and prolonged survival (WT CLP + VL-NIO = 38 Critical Care 2010, Volume 14 Suppl 1 http://ccforum.com/supplements/14/S1",

Levels correlated with mortality in patients and anti-HMGB antibodies prevented endotoxininduced death in animal models [1] . In marked contrast to these fi ndings are reports of cytoprotective eff ects because HMGB protected liver from ischemia/reperfusion (IR) [2] and HMGB-transgenic mice were resistant to myocardial infarction [3] . Despite these reports, little is known of the role or mechanism of HMGB. We aimed to further evaluate HMGB in rat hearts and in pulmonary and renal cell cultures. Methods Isolated hearts received HMGB/vehicle before 30 minutes ischemia and 120 minutes reperfusion. In separate studies, rats were rendered septic by caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) prior to IR. Left ventricular (LV) function was measured with a latex LV balloon. Infarct size was measured by TTC staining. For human cell culture studies, A549 alveolar cells or HK-2 renal tubular cells were treated with HMGB/vehicle before incubation in normoxia or hypoxia. Fluorimetric caspase-3 activity was used as measure of apoptosis. Cytochrome C was measured by ELISA. For HK-2 cells, the MTT assay was used to test viability. Results HMGB, prior to cardiac IR, preserved developed (d) LVP at 120 minutes reperfusion compared with controls (44 mmHg vs 27 mmHg, P <0.05) and infarct size, expressed as %V weight \u00b1 SEM, was reduced (31 \u00b1 5.4 vs 44 \u00b1 4.2, P <0.05), n = 6/group.

In A549 cells, HMGB inhibited apoptosis (49% reduced caspase-3 activity (8.6 vs 17.1 a.u., P <0.01)). This was associated with reduced cytochrome C release (250 vs 389 pg/ml, P <0.05).

There were a high positive linear correlation between CD64 and SOFA score (r = 0.806; Introduction The incidence of sepsis is reported around 37% in European ICUs [1] . The mortality rate depends on the severity of organ failure, up to 65% if four or more organs are involved. Multiple organ failure (MOF) is due to microcirculatory dysfunction with microthrombosis resulting from coagulation disorders including platelets' activation. An early diagnosis should identify the microcirculatory dysfunction before MOF became clinically evident. The diagnosis of sepsis is commonly based on clinical criteria, pathogen identifi cation and use of markers like procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (PCR) associated with infection. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether the routine measurement of immature platelet fraction (IPF), considered a precocious marker of platelet production, is associated with sepsis and its severity and/or whether it could be used as a predicting marker of sepsis. Methods We enrolled 66 consecutive patients admitted to the ICU, dividing them into two groups: septic (n = 44) and no septic (n = 22). The severity of sepsis was evaluated. The exclusion criterion was a platelet count <150,000/mm 3 . Blood count, coagulation, PCR, PCT, and IPF were collected every day.",

Medical patients formed 44% of the study cohort; whilst 23% of patients were general surgical and the remaining 33% were post cardiothoracic surgery. The age and admission APACHE II score of the study cohort was 61.8 (16.3) years and 18.4 (5.6) . The median LOS and ICU mortality of the cohort was 24 days and 27.6%. The most common CDC reportable diagnosis was clinical or microbiological confi rmed pneumonia (PNU1/PNU2/LRI) (n = 57), followed by intra-abdominal infection (SSI-GIT) (n = 10) and urinary tract infection (SUTI) (n = 8). The culture positivity rate was 71.2%. The appropriateness of the ICU antibiotic guideline is summarised in Table 1 . Monotherapy was used in 52.5% of episodes. The median length of antibiotic treatment with positive cultures was 7 days, and 5 days for culture negative episodes. In sepsis episodes with negative culture, antibiotics were stopped within 3 days in 17% of the episodes. Introduction Secondary peritonitis is the most frequent form of peritonitis, characterized by a high disease burden and a high mortality rate. Choice of adequate antibiotics is an independent factor for survival. The aim of this study was to compare treatment of secondary peritonitis with tigecycline (TG) with standard regimens (SR) from an economical standpoint. Methods After ethics committee approval, the study was performed as prospective, non-interventional cohort trial in 23 medical centers in Germany. Patients could be included if suff ering from severe secondary peritonitis treated in an ICU. Patients with pregnancy, aged below 18 years and milder forms of diseases (APACHE II score <15) were not eligible. In order to compare treatment with TG with SR, the following data were documented: demographic data, disease severity scores, causing microorganisms, laboratory parameters, and length of stay (LOS). Patients were analysed according to initial antibiotic choice except for perioperative prophylaxis. In order to balance for diff erences in co-morbidities and severity of disease, a matched-pairs analysis was performed based on logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 178 patients were enrolled (49 TG/129 SR). After logistic regression analysis and matching for gender, age \u00b1 3 years, APACHE II score \u00b1 1 and (non)existence of liver cirrhosis, arterial sclerosis and coronary heart disease, 15 matched pairs were built. Compared with the SR group, in the TG group was a tendency for higher creatinine, urea and glucose levels, higher number of co-morbidities (3.3 vs 3.0, NS) and higher number of pathogens isolated on initial surgery (2.2 vs 1.6, NS). There was a higher number of discharges 9/15 in the TG group (vs 7/15 SR, NS) and 6/15 patients died (vs 4/15 SR, NS). Considering these factors, there was a trend for shorter LOS in patients treated with TG (11 days vs 18 days and 8 days vs 16 days for survivors and nonsurvivors, respectively, NS) and total costs of ICU stay were signifi cantly lower in the TG group (\u20ac8,832 vs \u20ac15,482, P = 0.023).",

Methods A retrospective observational study of patients undergoing elective fi rst-time CABG was performed, covering a 13-month period. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics: fl ucloxacillin 1 g pre-operatively and three 1 g doses post-operatively. Patients who were MRSA-positive, MRSA unknown or penicillin allergic received an alternative regimen: vancomycin 1 g pre-operatively and 1 g post-operatively. Exclusion criteria: preoperative creatinine >133mmol/l, any antibiotics other than prophylaxis and haemodynamic support except <5 \u03bcg/kg/hour dopamine. Results Of 1,413 patients in the study period, 415 met the study criteria: 360 patients received fl ucloxacillin and 55 patients received vancomycin.

However, as infections mainly occur in extracellular tissue fl uid (ECF), corresponding unbound ECF antibiotic concentrations are responsible for the antimicrobial eff ect. Because of the blood-brain barrier, the cerebral antibiotic distribution is thought to be reduced compared with tissues without any physiological barrier. This study aims to determine meropenem (MPM) unbound concentrations in the brain and compare them with MPM concentrations in plasma to explore cerebral distribution of MPM in patients with acute brain injury. Methods After local ethic approval and written informed consent, two brain-injured patients, sedated, mechanically ventilated, receiving MPM for an infection and monitored by cerebral microdialysis (CMA 71, membrane length 10 mm, membrane diameter 0.6 mm, molecular cut-off 100 kDa; CMA, Stockholm, Sweden) were enrolled. The PK study succeeded to 1 g meropenem over 30 minutes and brain dialysates and blood samples were collected over 420 minutes. Probe recoveries were evaluated individually by retrodialysis. MPM was assayed by HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results For each of the two patients, the MPM brain AUC is much lower than plasma AUC and accordingly brain to serum AUC ratios are respectively 0.73 for Patient 1 (P1) and 0.14 for Patient 2 (P2). MPM concentration versus time curves in brain are delayed (time-to-peak in P1 = 100 minutes, in P2 = 80 minutes) and present a smooth peak compared with the corresponding curves in plasma ( Figure 1 ). Mean probe recoveries are respectively 19 \u00b1 7% for P1 and 29 \u00b1 7% for P2. Conclusions The MPM brain AUC is much lower than plasma AUC for the two patients enrolled, consistent with the PK theory in the presence of tissue with effl ux transporters. More patients are needed to better understand MPM brain distribution characteristics. [1] . The aim of this study was to explore the eff ect of changing this antibiotic prophylaxis protocol on microbial fl ora in sputum. Methods Retrospective study. All patients admitted >10 days on the ICU after elective CV surgery between 1 June 2006 and 1 June 2007 (Group 1) were compared with the same group of patients between 1 July 2007 and 1 August 2008 (Group 2). Patients received single-dose prophylaxis (bypass surgery), or 2 days of prophylaxis (cardiac prosthetic surgery). Group 1 received cefuroxime and Group 2 received cefazolin. Patients did not receive selective digestive tract decontamination. Isolated pathogens from elective sputum cultures of all patients were registered and compared between groups after dividing pathogens into six classes based on the profi le of intrinsic antibiotic susceptibility.

The production of metallo-\u03b2-lactamase leaves colistin as the only therapeutic option. Outbreaks due to MDRAB can persist for months. Traditional decontamination methods fail to deal with this level of colonisation and contamination eff ectively. We tackled a recent outbreak of MDRAB eff ectively using gaseous ozone. To our knowledge it is the fi rst time ozone has been used to control an outbreak of MDRAB. Methods An external company (Hydrozone Environmental Ltd) was hired to perform the fumigation. The ICU was divided into three decontamination areas using heavy-duty polythene sheets. Patients were in turn relocated from contaminated to clean areas before each area was sealed and fumigated. Humidity levels within were raised to 70 to 80% using a humidifi er. An Ozone Ultra Pro 16 g/hour ozone generator with ozone destruct capability, operated remotely, delivered ozone to a target concentration of >2.0 ppm for 15 minutes. A fan was used to achieve even dispersal. For safety reasons perimeter ozone concentrations were monitored with a UV photometer and kept below 0.05 ppm. The effi cacy of the fumigation was measured by environmental microbiological sampling before and after fumigation. Results All fumigated areas received ozone concentrations of 4.62 to 5.66 ppm for 21 to 32 minutes. Ozone was not detected outside the treatment areas. Prior to fumigation, 72 (38%) of 188 environmental samples were MDRAB-positive. Following fumigation, nine (5%) of 158 samples were positive. Most of these samples were from nontouch areas, for example ceiling, above door frame with signifi cant dust collection and without daily cleaning. Considering that dust may impede ozone penetration, Introduction In the current pandemic it is likely that some patients will be admitted to hospital and require respiratory support including mechanical ventilation. These patients are likely to have a profound systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS); consequently they may have multiorgan failure (MOF) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) with haemofi ltration. Two questions then arise -what dose of oseltamivir (Tamifl u) should we give these patients to shorten the duration of the H1N1 infection? How should we modify the dose in response to altered renal drug clearance and in those requiring RRT?",

Enteral nutrition absorption was uncertain, and thus we sampled her blood to ensure adequate oseltamivir absorption and that activation of the pro-drug was not inhibited. We undertook serial sampling for blood concentration assay to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters in this diffi cult scenario. Blood samples were collected in plain serum tubes (without sodium fl uoride). The samples were spun and refrigerated within half an hour, then batched and shipped to Bangkok for drug concentration measurement. Results We report both the parent oseltamivir phosphate (OP) and that of the active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). OP levels were low at 10 to 77 ng/ml. but OC concentrations were high at 2,600 to 5,000 ng/ml. Conclusions The population normal parameter for half-life OP is 1 hour and for OC it is 3 to 5 hours. A single dose of 150 mg OP is expected to achieve an OP level of 50 to 150 ng/ml and an OC level of 1,000 to 1,500 ng/ml. Our slightly low OP levels are likely to be due to ex vivo hydrolysis in the collection tube due to a lack of esterase inhibitor. The high OC levels are most probably due to reduced renal elimination despite being on haemofi ltration. Our concerns were focused on the possibility of viral mutation (subsequently shown to be negative) or poor enteral absorption/activation. What we found was that 150 mg BD produces more than adequate OC levels to treat H1N1 infection.",

Introduction Direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized fi ber column (DHP-PMX; Toray Industries Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was fi rst developed in 1994 and has since been used for the treatment of septic shock. Methods A total of 47 patients with septic shock who received DHP-PMX for 2 to 6 hours were retrospectively reviewed to examine any improvement in sepsis-related factors after DHP-PMX and to analyze the relationship between any such improvement and increase in SBP. Introduction Direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized fi ber column (DHP-PMX) has been used for the treatment of septic shock. As an alternative method for acute blood purifi cation therapy, continuous venovenous hemodiafi ltration (CVVHDF) has been reported to be an eff ective clinical treatment for critically ill patients; however, the optimal column for performing CVVHDF remains controversial. On the other hand, recently, one of the lipid mediators, endocannabinoids (N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG)) have been reported with a blood pressure decreased eff ect. Methods We investigated 14 polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membrane hemofi lters and three polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane hemofi lters after use in patients with septic shock. Therefore, in clinical study, we used CVVHDF after DHP-PMX to treat 32 patients with septic shock. To determine the optimal acute blood purifi cation therapy, we subsequently divided the patients into two groups: group A underwent CVVHDF using a PMMA membrane hemofi lter after undergoing DHP-PMX (n = 25); group B underwent CVVHDF using a PAN membrane hemofi lter after undergoing DHP-PMX (n = 7). In addition, the levels of endocannabinoids (AEA, 2-AG) were measured. The severity scores and the improvement of endocannabinoids were compared between the two groups. Results Endocannabinoids (AEA, 2-AG) were adsorbed more in the PMMA column (AEA; 506.3 \u00b1 680.2 ng/column, 2-AG; 23.0 \u00b1 38.5 \u03bcg/column) than in the PAN column (AEA; 1.5 \u00b1 0.7 ng/column, 2-AG; 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg/column).

Methods Retrospective study of 400 consecutive ICU patients ventilated >48 hours in the past 4 years. Patients age, gender, APACHE II, prior illness, cause of admittance, length of stay (LOS), time of mechanical ventilation (MV), outcome, time of appearance of AC and infection of the LRT were registered. MODS and CPIS were measured at onset of infection (VAT-VAP) and 3 days after. MODS was also calculated on the day AC appeared. Bronchial secretions were cultured at admission, at least once a week and whenever there was a change in the amount and quality of bronchial secretions or clinical infection was suspected. The Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis and statistical signifi cance was set at P <0.05. Results From the 400 studied patients 68 (17%) were colonized and 153 (48.25%) developed infections: 54 (13.5%) VAT and 99 (24.7%) VAP.

Twenty-fi ve (36.7%) of the colonized patients developed infections of the LRT (with the same pathogen): 8 (11.7%) VAT after 4.6 \u00b1 2.7 days and 17 (25%) were diagnosed with VAP after 9.8 \u00b1 1.8 days. From the eight VAT patients, four developed VAP (50%) after 5.4 \u00b1 0.4 days. None of the colonized patients died. The colonized patients who developed infections were elderly (P <0.05), more severely ill (P <0.04) and had at the time of infection a diagnosis higher temperature (P <0.01), more severe leukocytosis (P <0.02) but not statistically signifi cant organ dysfunction (P >0.3).

Methods Adult BALB/c mice were infected with X31 (H3N2) infl uenza (1:80) via the intranasal route and randomized to intraperitoneal rehydration with 20 ml/kg compound sodium lactate (CSL), normal saline (NS) or no rehydration (NR) starting on day 3 following infection and continued for 4 days (n = 5/group). On day 7, mice were challenged with 1 x 10 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotype 2). Two further cohorts of mice were challenged with diff erent doses of infl uenza and rehydrated from day 3 to 7 to investigate pulmonary immune responses in the absence of bacteria. Mice were infected with 1:80 (n = 10/group) infl uenza and rehydrated once daily or 1:60 (n = 5/group) infl uenza and rehydrated twice (1:60) daily with 20 ml/kg CSL or not. Daily weight, survival following secondary bacterial pneumonia, number of colony-forming units (48 hours after bacterial challenge) from peripheral blood, lung, and nasal wash and cellularity in lung compartments were measured. Results Rehydration did not aff ect weight loss following 1:80 infl uenza infection (na\u00efve mice (+0.3 \u00b1 0.4 g), infl uenza plus NR (-1.58 \u00b1 0.4 g), infl uenza plus CSL (-1.1 \u00b1 0.7 g) and infl uenza with NS (-1.3 \u00b1 0.4 g)). A repeat experiment with CSL once daily or twice daily did not alter weight loss compared with NR (P >0.05). Survival or CFU counts following bacterial pneumonia did not diff er between the groups (P >0.05). The total number or activational status of bronchoalveolar, lung macrophages/monocytes and lymphocytes was not aff ected by rehydration following infl uenza infection or 48 hours following bacterial pneumonia (P >0.05; P <0.05 vs na\u00efve mice).",

The study objective was to examine the eff ect of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's ventilator bundle plus oral decontamination with chlorhexidine (ODC) in the incidence of VAP in an ICU. Methods The study was conducted in a 20-bed, medical-surgical ICU. Criteria for nosocomial pneumonia are those from the CDC. Strategy was to implement the IHI's ventilator bundle plus ODC. The goals were the ICU team adhesion of 80% achieved in the ninth month after bundle implementation and 98% after 1 year of follow-up. These measures included fi ve strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia: 30 to 45\u00b0 elevation of the head of the bed, adequate sedation level (Ramsay 2 or 3), DVT/PE prevention, peptic ulcer prophylaxis and oral decontamination with chlorhexidine 0.12%. From February 2009 onwards, the ICU nursing staff and ICT performed a daily checklist in order to observe the fi ve issues accomplishment. If any item was found to be inadequate it was promptly corrected. Introduction This systematic review aims to evaluate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for oral chlorhexidine in preventing nosocomial pneumonia in intubated mechanically ventilated critically ill adults. Use of oral chlorhexidine appeals since it should reduce bacterial aspiration from the orophayrnx. A number of RCTs have recently been published on this topic. Methods Search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, grey literature registers, conference proceedings and reference lists for RCTs comparing chlorhexidine with placebo or standard care for prevention of pneumonia in the critically ill. Outcomes: episode of nosocomial respiratory tract infection (RTI), mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and length of ITU stay (ITU LOS).

All patients were treated with oral administration of oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) and inhaled zanamivir (10 mg twice daily) since ICU admission. Six patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to their critical respiratory conditions. Two of them resulted co-infected by legionella pneumophila. Results As shown in Figure 1 , RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab at ICU admission failed to demonstrate the viral infection in four patients, whereas RT-PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage had a sensibility of 100%. Similarly, the time course showed that RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab resulted negative in an average time of 3 days after therapy start, while RT-PCRs from bronchoalveolar lavage continued to permit infection monitoring and therapy regimen conduction.

Anyway, pleural gliding was present most of the time (87.5%), even if with a visible decrease of its movement. This was replaced with the lung pulse only in the presence of important lung consolidation. Alveolar interstitial syndrome (AIS) was always present on the whole lung, ranging from moderate to severe (100%), with high positivity at the base, posteriorly (100%). White lung appeared in every patient, most at the lung base and in the middle fi elds, posteriorly. As far as consolidation is concerned, its presence was confi rmed in 100% of the patients, associated with satellite multiple subpleural consolidations in 37.5% of patients. Basal lung was always involved (100%), followed by middle (50%) and apical fi elds(25%). Bronchogram was present in 100% of patients in bigger consolidations. Their aspect was aerial and only in one patient, with severe consolidations, turned into a fl uid one. Anechoic pleural eff usions were found in 37.5% of patients. No cases of pneumothorax were detected. Conclusions In this group of patients, H1N1 infection shows diff erent lung patterns altogether, where the most frequent seemed to be severe basal posterior AIS, multiple subpleural lung consolidations, and multiple parenchymal consolidation with bronchogram.

Introduction Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-negative patients frequently presents as fulminant respiratory failure and is associated with a high mortality rate when the patient requires mechanical ventilation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the outcome and prognostic factors in the patients with HIV-negative PCP requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and collected the HIV-negative patients who were microbiologically confi rmed as PCP and required MV in ICU over a 10-year period in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Results A total of 51 patients were identifi ed. Mean age was 55.4 \u00b1 15.0 years. Mean APACHE II score at ICU admission was 25.7 \u00b1 5.8. The 28-day mortality and in-hospital mortality were 45.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Between survivors and nonsurvivors, there were no signifi cant diff erences in baseline characteristics, APACHE II score, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, and absolute neutrophil counts on ICU admission day. Also the mortality was not diff erent in relation to the presence of barotrauma, application of noninvasive ventilation, timing of susceptible antibiotic administration, changing or not to salvage regimens, presence of cytomegalovirus coinfection and even the microbiologic persistency in follow-up specimens. Based on the types and intensity of previous immunosuppressive therapy, we classifi ed patients into three subgroups: patients receiving low-dose steroid maintenance \u00b1 other immunosuppressive agents (LS), which represent previously stable organ transplants; another group consisting of patients receiving recent intensive chemotherapy (CTx); and the other group refers to patients receiving high dose (defi ned as >2 weeks at least 1 mg/kg dose) steroid therapy \u00b1 other immunosuppressive agents (HS). Signifi cant diff erences of outcome were observed among the three diff erent groups (28-day mortality: LS = 22.2%, CTx = 29.4%, HS = 71.4%, P = 0.01; 60-day mortality: LS = 33.3%, CTx = 64.7%, HS = 81.0%, P = 0.04).

Due to technical restraints, size limitations, the necessity for a relatively large amount of blood withdrawn and possible indicator toxicity, many methods of cardiac output monitoring are not feasible, hence cardiac output is generally estimated from indirect parameters of systemic blood fl ow. In a former study we assessed the agreement for cardiac output using the ultrasound dilution method (UDCO) and ultrasound transit time-based measurement of main pulmonary blood fl ow in a juvenile piglet model without shunts [1] . In the present study we analyzed the infl uence of a left-to-right shunt on the agreement between UDCO and ultrasonic transit time pulmonary blood fl ow in a juvenile lamb model. Methods In this prospective, experimental animal study, which was approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal Research of the Radboud University Nijmegen, we placed a Gore-Tex\u00ae shunt between the left pulmonary artery and the descending aorta in eight randombred newborn lambs (3.5 to 8.3 kg). This aortopulmonary shunt was intermittently opened and closed while cardiac output was manipulated by creating hemorrhagic hypotension. Ultrasound dilution cardiac output (Q-UDCO) -using repeated injection of 1.0 ml/kg isotonic saline at body temperature -was compared with pulmonary blood fl ow (Q-MPA) invasively measured by a perivascular fl ow probe around the main pulmonary artery.

            "text": "Introduction Arrhythmias are common among high-risk surgical and ICU patients. The PulseCO pressure waveform algorithm is used for both LiDCO\u2122plus and LiDCOrapid hemodynamic monitors, which are frequently used to estimate cardiac output (CO) in critically ill patients. Cardiac arrythmias could increase the variation of both the lithium dilution (LiDCO) and/or the PulseCO measurement. At set-up the algorithm is calibrated by comparing the PulseCO CO estimate, averaged over 30 seconds, with a known CO (normally LiDCO) to generate a calibration factor (CF) [1] . This study was designed to explore the eff ect of arrythmias on the accuracy of CF generation in the PulseCO monitor. Methods LiDCO\u2122plus hemodynamic data fi les were obtained retro spectively from a university hospital medical/surgical ICU. Files were separated into those records with and without arrhythmia -defi ned as heart rate variation >5% during at least one additional CF determination after monitor set-up. Previous studies have established the coeffi cient of variation (CV) of a single LiDCO determination at 8% [2] and the PulseCO measurement at 2.4% [3] . A combined CV, refl ecting the eff ect of calibration, is estimated at 8.5%, resulting in an expected precision for the CF of 17%. Data were analysed for variation in CF against HRV using linear regression and the Student' s t test. Results Twenty-eight records were collected and analysed. Twenty-one records contained 32 post set-up calibration events. Of these 17 occurred with HRV \u22645% (median = 1%, range: 0 to 5%) and 15 occurred while HRV >5% (median: 19%, range: 7 to 26%). The average variation in CF during HRV was 5.4 \u00b1 4.0% and for high HRV was 8.9 \u00b1 8.1% of the initial value. The t test indicated no diff erence in the mean variation of CF (P = 0.162) or median. There was no correlation between HRV and CF variation (r 2 = 0.002). Ninety-one per cent (29/32) of the observed CF variation were less than 17% of the initial CF value.",

Seven CI measurements (median number; every 4 hours) by thermodilution (TD) were performed in each patient (in triplicate), PC-derived data were recorded continuously. We used a special PiCCOplus monitor with a disabled auto-recalibrate feature; that is, TD did not lead to an automatic calibration of the PC analysis. Calibration was only performed manually once at the start of the analysis for each patient. Later TD measurements were recorded but had no eff ect on the CIPC. An additional comparison was performed using the FloTrac/Vigileo System (Edwards, USA), which does not need manual recalibration and instead recalibrates itself every 60 seconds based on the arterial waveform. The FloTrac/Vigileo monitor used was a secondgeneration device (software version 1.14). Both the pressure transducers of the PiCCO and the FloTrac were connected in series to the same femoral artery catheter. Introduction Cardiac output (CO) monitoring is one of the key points in the hemodynamic evaluation of critically ill patients, and can be useful in various settings of high-risk surgery. There is a lack of evidence that the extensive use of invasive devices in the hemodynamic monitoring has a good impact in terms of outcome [1] , and less invasive systems have been proposed. Our aim was to compare the CO estimated by Vigileo/FloTrac with the blood fl ow in thoracic aorta as measured by transoesophageal Doppler in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, during the aortic cross-clamping (AoX) phase. We have measured the Augmentation Index (AI), a parameter related to vascular stiff ness, using the applanation tonometry method, in order to have a better understanding of the eff ect of AoX on blood pressure waves. Methods We enrolled 10 consecutive patients (10 men; age 66 \u00b1 6 years) undergoing elective open AAA repair (ASA II to III) under general anesthesia. Radial arterial access was used for semi-invasive determination of blood pressures and CO (APCO) with the Vigileo. An esophageal Doppler was positioned after clinical stabilization. Applanation tonometry was measured just before and after the aortic clamping.",

Normal values of GEDI have been created more than a decade ago based on studies in pre-selected patients. Therefore, it was the aim of our prospective study to investigate the correlation of GEDI to cardiac index (CI) in clinical routine. Methods Over a 6-month period all 1,574 routine TPTD measurements in 78 consecutive patients (APACHE II: 23.5 \u00b1 8.6) of an internal ICU with a PiCCO catheter were prospectively documented and analysed: correlation (Spearman) and multiple regression analysis; SPSS 17.0. Results Including all 1,574 measurements, CI was univariately correlated to GEDI (r = 0.251; P <0.001), dP max (r = 0.221; P <0.001) and heart rate (r = 0.102; P <0.001), but not to CVP (r = 0.001; P = 0.962). The correlation of GEDI, dP max and heart rate to CI was confi rmed in multivariate analysis (P <0.001 for all three variables). Changes in CI (Delta-CI) were univariately correlated to changes in GEDI (r = 0.414), dP max (r = 0.240) and ELWI (r = 0.152; P <0.001 for all comparisons). In a multivariate analysis of all measurements, Delta-CI was independently associated with changes in GEDI (P <0.001), dP max (P <0.001) and CVP (P = 0.017). Subgroup analysis of all measurements with GEDI below the lower normal level 680 ml/kg/m 2 demonstrated an independent association of CI to GEDI (P <0.001), dP max (P <0.001) and ELWI (P = 0.041) but not to CVP. Similarly, Delta-CI was independently associated with changes in GEDI and dP max (P <0.001). Similar results were found for the measurements with GEDI within the normal range (680 to 800 ml/kg/ m 2 ): signifi cant and independent correlation of CI to GEDI (P <0.017) and dP max (P <0.001). Changes in CI were independently correlated to changes in GEDI (P <0.001), dP max (P <0.001) and CVP (P = 0.035). Interestingly, even in measurements with GEDI >800 ml/kg/m 2 , CI was independently correlated to GEDI (P = 0.009) and dP max (P <0.001). Changes in CI in this group were independently associated with changes in dP max and GEDI (P <0.001).In the subgroup of measurements with GEDI >1,000 ml/kg/m 2 there was no correlation of any parameter to CI, however changes in CI were independently correlated to changes in GEDI (P <0.001) and dP max (P = 0.003).",

Methods Single-blinded, prospective observational study conducted on consecutive adult patients undergoing major head and neck reconstructive free fl ap surgery.

The anaesthetist was blinded to the LiDCOrapid data and observations were made by an independent investigator.

We aimed to investigate the feasibility of StO 2 measurements in the mouth as a quantitative indicator comparable with StO 2 measurements obtained from the thenar eminence during changes in central blood volume (CBV). Methods We performed a head-up tilt (HUT) test in 10 healthy volunteers as an experimental model to reduce CBV. StO 2 was continuously measured using two devices (InSpectra model 650): a multiple depth optical probe was placed over the thenar eminence (15 and 25 mm) and a 1-mm probe was placed in the mouth. Subjects were placed on an electrically driven tilt table with a footboard. After 5 minute baseline measurements in the supine position, the table was tilted up to 70\u00b0 and returned to the supine position after 10 minutes. StO 2 readings were analyzed at the lowest stroke volume value. Results All subjects (mean age: 23 \u00b1 6; six males) tolerated well the supine and head-up positions. Cardiac output signifi cantly decreased in the HUT position; simultaneous decrease in StO 2 was observed in the mouth, but not in the thenar. The general results of the HUT test are shown in Tables  1 and 2 . Introduction Hemodynamic optimisation based on fl ow variables allows an early detection and correction of possible occult organ hypoperfusion in patients undergoing major surgery. Shoemaker described a markedly decreased cardiac index (CI) in nonsurvivors, which remained signifi cantly below the values compared with survivors during the surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the length of ICU stay, overall in-hospital stay and the postoperative outcome in a group of patients undergoing major urological surgery, while the CI is maintained within the normal range during intraoperative period. Methods Patients were randomised into groups the day before surgeryconventional management group (decision about fl uid therapy and vasoactive support was based on internal guidelines to preserve normal macrohemodynamic variables), and protocol group. Each patient in the protocol group received an oesophageal Doppler probe (TED) (Hemosonic 100; Arrow International, USA) after the start of general anaesthesia and then hemodynamic optimisation (fl uid management and vasoactive drugs), according to TED variables, was performed to keep CI between 2.6 and 3.8 l/minute/m 2 .",

There were no signifi cant diff erences in baseline variables between both groups (age, gender, length of surgical procedure, estimated blood loss and also in intraoperative values of MAP and CVP). In the protocol group was observed a high frequency of CI <2.6 l/minute/m 2 after induction of anesthesia 75% with fast recovery of CI. Introduction Fluid therapy in ICU patients serves to maintain tissue perfusion and is directed at increasing cardiac stroke volume (SV) through an increase in preload: fl uid responsiveness. Although there is increasing evidence that the regional blood fl ow cannot be predicted from global hemodynamic measurements, the relation between SV and parameters of peripheral perfusion is not clear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the eff ect of an increase in preload on commonly used parameters of peripheral perfusion. Methods Hemodynamically unstable patients with clinically suspected fl uid responsiveness underwent a passive leg raising (PLR) test, which consisted of 5 minutes of rest in a semirecumbent position of 30\u00b0, followed by 5 minutes PLR (lower limbs elevated at 30\u00b0 and trunk in supine position). SV was measured continuously by pulse contour analysis using PiCCO (Pulsion). Peripheral perfusion was measured continuously with sidestream dark fi eld imaging (sublingual area) and laser Doppler fl owmetry (LDF) (fi nger). Results Sixteen patients (age: 63 years (55 to 72), APACHE II: 25 (20 to 28), SOFA: 10 (7 to 13)) were included in our study. Of these 16 patients, six (38%) increased their SV by >10% in response to a PLR. Flow indices (LDF and sublinguale microcirculatory fl ow) did not change. However, there was a trend in increase of the functional capillary density in the responders (see Figure 1 ). Conclusions These data suggest that increasing SV in hemodynamically unstable patients might improve peripheral perfusion, however only in the sublingual area and not in all patients. There was no relation between systemic circulation and peripheral perfusion: it remains to be investigated whether optimizing SV actually results in improved tissue perfusion. Among all patients, at baseline, median CI and dIVC% were 2.6 l/minute/ m 2 and 29%, respectively. Volume expansion signifi cantly increased the median CI from 2.6 (2 to 3.3) to 3 (2.1 to 4) l/minute/m 2 (P = 0.005) and decreased dIVC% from 29.4% to 12.6% (P = 0.003). The median dIVC% in R was higher than NR: 31.3% vs 17% (P <0.05). Fluid therapy decreased more dIVC% in R than in NR: R 31% to 12% (P = 0.03), NR 17% to 12% (P = 0.04). The dIVC% showed similar trend in both groups of septic shock (SS) and trauma shock (TS) patients before and after fl uid therapy: dIVC% 27% in SS and 24% in TS before fl uid therapy; 15% in SS and 11% in TS after therapy. Conclusions Our data suggest that dIVC% is a sensitive index of fl uid responsive ness in septic and trauma patients in shock. Limitations: few patients.",

So far, the mechanism underlying sildenafi l's eff ects on pulmonary vascular remodeling and potassium channel activity in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) has not been clearly addressed in pulmonary hypertension secondary to increased pulmonary blood fl ow. Methods A total of 27 male SD rats were randomly divided into a sham group (n = 9), a shunt group (n = 9) and a shunt + sildenafi l group (n = 9). A left-to-right shunt was established by performing an abdominal aorta to inferior vena cava fi stula both in the shunt group and the shunt + sildenafi l group. Rats in the shunt + sildenafi l group received oral sildenafi l 10 mg/kg/ day, whereas the rats in the sham group and the shunt group were fed with normal saline of the same volume. Eleven weeks later, mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was measured. Meanwhile, the ratio of right ventricular mass to left ventricular plus septal mass (RV/(LV+S)) was detected as a marker of the degree of right ventricular hypertrophy. The relative medial thickness (RMT) of middle and small pulmonary muscularized arteries was calculated as a sign of pathological changes of pulmonary vasculature.

The U patients fi rst received U 6.25 mg boluses every 5 minutes until the diastolic BP dropped below 105 mmHg, followed by a 4 mg/hour infusion adjusted as needed. In the N group, patients fi rst received a N 1 \u03b3/kg/minute infusion until a 15% reduction in mean BP, followed by a N 0.75 \u03b3/kg/minute infusion adjusted as needed. Non-invasive BP was assessed every 5 minutes during treatment titration and then every 15 minutes. The time needed to reach the therapeutic goal was registered. The main endpoint was the achievement of the BP goal in 2 hours or less. Tolerance was assessed by the number of episodes of hypotension (HO) (defi ned as MBP below 100 mmHg) and side eff ects. Severe HO, defi ned as MBP below 80 mmHg or two episodes of HO, was considered as treatment failure and led to exclusion. Further assessment was limited to safety, amount of ocytocics used and neonatal evaluation by ICU paediatricians until discharge from ICU. Results were compared using analysis of variance. Side eff ects were compared with the chi-square test. Results One U patient was excluded from the effi cacy assessment due to a protocol violation. The main endpoint was reached in all 17 patients, after 50 minutes in both groups. During the fi rst 2 hours, the needed treatment adjustment median value was 1 (0 to 10) in the U group and 1 (0 to 13) in the N group. Side eff ects attributable to the study treatment were observed in six of the nine cases in the N group and in one of the nine cases in the U group (P <0.02). There were no severe side eff ects or neonatal side eff ects.",

However, this is currently not supported by human clinical data. Therefore we used real-time human microvascular imaging to test our hypothesis that pulsatile perfusion would enhance microvascular perfusion. Methods We used sidestream dark fi eld imaging to record video clips of the human microcirculation in 16 patients undergoing routine CPB for cardiac surgery. Following administration of cardioplegia, CPB was continued in either pulsatile (PP, n = 8) or nonpulsatile (NP) mode. After 10 minutes, microvascular recordings were made. The perfusion mode was then switched from PP to NP or vice versa. Ten minutes later, a second series of microvascular video recordings were obtained. Global hemodynamic and laboratory data were recorded and the energy equivalent pressure (EEP) and pulse pressure (both mean \u00b1 SD) were calculated to quantify PP generated surplus energy. Microvascular analysis was performed both for smaller and larger microvessels with a diameter cut-off of 20 \u03bcm. Assessments included perfused vessel density (PVD) (mean \u00b1 SD, 95% confi dence intervals of the diff erence between NP and PP (95% CID)) and the Microvascular Flow Index (MFI) (mean \u00b1 SD and interquartile range).",

In contrast, the two groups had similar values for glucose (5.9 \u00b1 2.7 vs 4.3 \u00b1 2.9, P = 0.18), glycerol (369 \u00b1 225 vs 252 \u00b1 171, P = 0.21), and L/P ratio (83 \u00b1 289 vs 75 \u00b1 150, P = 0.92). Septic shock correlated with SOFA on day 1 (r = 0.55, P = 0.001), APACHE II (r = 0.42, P = 0.01), lactate on day 1 (r = 0.48, P = 0.004), lactate on day 2 (r = 0.50, P = 0.002), pyruvate on day 1 (r = 0.040, P = 0.018), and with pyruvate on day 2 (r = 0.35, P = 0.04). Nonsurvivors had higher glycerol (426 \u00b1 236 vs 253 \u00b1 157, P = 0.01) at study entry and on day 1 (437 \u00b1 260 vs 282 \u00b1 169, P = 0.04) compared with survivors. Nonsurvivors also had higher pyruvate levels on day 1 (170 \u00b1 99 vs 104 \u00b1 65, P = 0.03) and on day 2 (150 \u00b1 81 vs 97 \u00b1 61, P = 0.04). Logistic regression analysis showed that APACHE II (OR = 1.312, P = 0.06) and glycerol on day 1 (OR = 1.005, P = 0.04) independently predicted patient outcome.",

Ten articles discussed tissue oxygenation in a hemorrhagic model and nine articles in a model of endotoxemia. No relevant articles concerning ptO 2 and experimental trauma were found. Eight articles compared splanchnic ptO 2 measurements in relation to ptO 2 measured in several peripheral sites, like subcutaneous and skeletal muscle tissue. A positive correlation between these locations was found in seven articles. A decrease in both peripheral and central tissue oxygen pressure (ptO 2 ) was found during hemorrhage. Importantly, peripheral ptO 2 changed earlier during hemorrhage before any hemodynamic parameter did. In contrast, only one article found an earlier change in hemodynamic parameters than in peripheral ptO 2 . Nine articles discussed ptO 2 in a model of septic shock. Only two studies compared peripheral ptO 2 measurements with splanchnic ptO 2 measurements. Both sites had decreased ptO 2 values in endotoxemia and both were found to change before any changes in hemodynamic parameters. Conclusions A signifi cant relation between intestinal ptO 2 and peripheral ptO 2 was found in studies on experimental models of hemorrhagic and septic shock. This suggests that peripheral sites like the subcutaneous tissue or skeletal muscles tissue are reliable locations for measurements of ptO 2 . In all, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), and standard hemodynamic parameters were continuously recorded.

Introduction Although the adverse eff ects of mechanical ventilation on circulation and intestinal organ perfusion are well known, the infl uence of assisted breathing versus controlled ventilation has not been investigated. We hypothesized that pressure support ventilation causes less decrease in gut perfusion and less neutrophil adhesion than controlled ventilation. Methods Male SD rats (n = 40) were anesthetized and tracheotomized and 10 animals each ventilated in pressure support (PSV) or pressure controlled (PCV) mode. PCV animals were paralyzed. After 5 hours of ventilation, intravital microscopy was performed. Endotoxin (15 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide) was given to 20 rats, 20 animals served as controls.

Pressure-controlled ventilation had a signifi cant infl uence on microcirculation and neutrophil adhesion in controls. In septic animals, pressure support ventilation did not attenuate these adverse eff ects as compared with PCV. Introduction Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 ) has been shown to be a useful therapeutic target in septic shock or high-risk surgery. The central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide diff erence (Pcv-aCO 2 ) has been proposed as a complementary tool for goal-directed therapy (GDT) in septic shock. We tested the hypothesis that both ScvO 2 and Pcv-aCO 2 could be used as complementary tools for GDT during high-risk surgery. Methods Seventy adult patients, ASA I to III, undergoing major abdominal surgery, were randomly assigned to 6 ml/kg/hour (R-GDT group, n = 36) or 12 ml/kg/hour (C-GDT group, n = 34) of crystalloids. Additional boluses of HES (130/0.4) were given to maintain respiratory variation in peak aortic fl ow velocity (\u0394PV) below 13%. In both groups, ScvO 2 , cardiac output (CO), oxygen delivery (DO 2 i), Pcv-aCO 2 and postoperative complications were blindly recorded. Results At baseline, there were no diff erences in hemodynamic variables, ScvO 2 (79 \u00b1 7 vs 80 \u00b1 6, P = 0.37) and Pcv-aCO 2 (6 \u00b1 3 vs 6 \u00b1 2, P = 0.95). The total volume of fl uid perfused was larger in the C-GDT group than in the R-GDT group (P <0.01). The two groups showed no diff erences in intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, mean CO and mean DO 2 i values. Overall, postoperative complications were increased in the R-GDT group (P <0.01), especially postoperative sepsis occurred more often (P = 0.0064). Minimal ScvO 2 (minScvO 2 ) was higher in the C-GDT group (72 \u00b1 6 vs 69 \u00b1 6%, P = 0.04). In patients with complications, minScvO 2 was signifi cantly reduced (72 \u00b1 6 vs 67 \u00b1 6%, P = 0.0017). minScvO 2 <70% was independently associated with sepsis (OR 4.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 14.4), P = 0.025). Intraoperative mean Pcv-aCO 2 was higher in the R-GDT group (7 \u00b1 3 vs 5 \u00b1 2 mmHg, P <0.01). In patients who develop sepsis, Pcv-aCO 2 was higher than in patients who did not (8 \u00b1 2 vs 5 \u00b1 2 mmHg, P <0.01). In patients with ScvO 2 >70% and who develop sepsis, Pcv-aCO 2 was also signifi cantly higher (P <0.01). The area under the ROC curve was 0.758 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.81) for discrimination of patients with ScvO 2 >70% who did and did not develop sepsis, with 5 mmHg as the best threshold value. Conclusions ScvO 2 refl ects important changes in oxygen delivery in relation to oxygen needs during the perioperative period and might help guiding GDT better than \u0394PV alone. Pcv-aCO 2 appears a useful tool to identify persistent hypoperfusion when GDT is associated with ScvO 2 >70%. is a marker of venous fl ow adequacy to remove the total CO 2 produced by peripheral tissues [1] . Substitution of a central for a mixed venousarterial pCO 2 diff erence is acceptable [2] . The objective was to assess the relationship between \u0394CO 2 and SOFA score variation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Lactate and ScO 2 were also evaluated. Methods Prospective observational study in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock admitted to an adult tertiary ICU. The management of sepsis was carried out as proposed by Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. The earliest simultaneous measurement of lactate, SvcO 2 , and \u0394CO 2 were obtained when clinically indicated (T0) and after 8 to 12 hours (T8-12). The SOFA score was determined at T0 and after 24 hours (T24) and \u0394SOFA (T24-T0) was calculated. Conclusions Patients with hyperlactatemia in the beginning of admission, which persists with increased levels of lactate, evolve to a worsening of SOFA score in 24 hours. \u0394CO 2 and SvcO 2 and its trends are unrelated to the SOFA score in 24 hours.",

Several studies have already shown that dPCO 2 and the cardiac index (CI) are inversely correlated in critically ill patients. However, the dPCO 2 can be infl uenced not only by CI, but also by other factors governing CO 2 production and CO 2 elimination. The aim of this work was to study the behaviour of dPCO 2 , measured from central venous blood, and its evolution during the early stage of septic shock. Methods Forty-six patients with septic shock were prospectively included. dPCO 2 was calculated by the diff erence between the arterial PCO 2 and the PCO 2 from central venous blood. A value of dPCO 2 >6 mmHg was considered high. The CI was measured by transpulmonary thermodilution. ScvO 2 and serum lactate were obtained.

Introduction High lactate (LCT) identifi es critically ill patients, predicts risk of mortality and guides resuscitation. Low central venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ) is associated with mortality and is used as a resuscitation target. A change in LCT, but not in SvO 2 , has been shown to relate to outcome. It is physiologically plausible that those with low SvO 2 and high LCT do worse versus those with only one of SvO 2 or LCT abnormal, or with both normal. Early changes in these combinations may also determine subsequent changes in organ performance. We hypothesised that changes in combinations in SvO 2 and LCT from day 1 to day 2 predicted changes in total SOFA between day 2 and day 4. Methods We used a retrospective cohort methodology using data obtained from the electronic clinical information system. All included patients underwent LCT and SvO 2 measurement (from internal jugular or subclavian vein) in the fi st 24 hours after ICU admission. Baseline (demographic, physiological), daily follow-up (physiological, SOFA) and 30-day mortality data were recorded. Worst admission values were used to combine SvO 2 /LCT into four groups (SL groups: 0 to 3) dichotomised by mean (SvO 2 ) and median (LCT): 0 -N/N; 1 -L/N; 2 -N/H; 3 -L/H. Variables individually associated (P <0.20) with a change in total SOFA between day 2 and day 4 were included in a multivariate linear regression model (with change in total SOFA as the dependent variable) using forward stepwise inclusion.

The diff erent eff ects observed for SIG and BE imply a signifi cant unmeasured acid load infl uencing mortality. Bias and confounding may aff ect these fi ndings and they should therefore be confi rmed prospectively. Introduction Intubation and mechanical ventilation impair secretion clearance and can lead to lung collapse, consolidation and ventilatorassociated pneumonia [1] . There is, however, no valid diagnosis of secretion retention in the intubated and ventilated patient. Vibration response imaging (VRI) is a commercially developed acoustic lung imaging system that displays breath sound distribution [2] . VRI should be able to identify relationships between specifi c breath sound distributions and secretion retention. This preliminary study investigated the changes in VRI measurements before and after chest physiotherapy in adult intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. Methods Intubated and ventilated adult patients who were receiving chest physiotherapy were investigated. Lung sound amplitude at peak inspiration was measured immediately before and after chest physiotherapy using two arrays of sensors attached to the patient's back in a supine position. Chest physiotherapy included combinations of closed airway suctioning, saline lavage, postural drainage, manual techniques and/or lung hyperinfl ation, dependent upon clinical indications. Means are compared with the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Results A total of 16 patients were included in the study (12 males, four females, age 65 \u00b1 14). Patients were predominantly ventilated with continuous positive airway pressure and pressure support. Following physiotherapy, total lung sound amplitude at peak inspiration decreased twofold from 37 \u00b1 58.10 6 to 18 \u00b1 23.10 6 arbitrary units (AU), with signifi cant reduction in the left lung (P = 0.03). Furthermore, the diff erence in sound amplitude between right and left lungs signifi cantly decreased posttreatment compared with pretreatment (P = 0.03).",

Introduction Knowledge of micromechanical properties of lung parenchyma is essential for understanding macroscopic lung mechanics. The fi rst results of in vivo and in situ measurements using an endomicroscopic device [1] are reported. The degree of local lung deformation in dependence of locally applied pressure is shown. Methods An endoscopic system including two concentric trocars was constructed to apply a defi ned local pressure within the fi eld of view (P fov ). The endoscopic system was placed between the ribs of mechanically ventilated rats with the tip placed on the pleura. P fov was applied to a circular area on to the lungs' surface and led to a local deformation. By adjusting the fl ow rate of the fl ushing fl uid from the outer trocar to the inner trocar, P fov was varied. The resulting local deformation of lung parenchyma was optically measured by estimating the diameter of ceramic particles, fi xed on the pleura for that purpose. Deformation was measured at diff erent levels of airway pressure (P aw ) with P fov ramped from 0 to -40 mbar.",

The purpose of this study was to assess regional lung ventilation by EIT in a pig model of acid-induced acute lung injury (ALI) during pressurecontrolled (PCV) and volume-controlled ventilation (VCV). Methods Ten anesthetized and tracheotomized female pigs (25 to 30 kg) were randomized into two groups: mechanical ventilation by PCV (pressure adjusted to achieve and maintain 8 ml/kg tidal volume, n = 5) or VCV (8 ml/kg, n = 5) in FiO 2 50%. ALI was induced in both groups by intratracheal instillation of 4 ml/kg hydrochloric acid (HCl) 0.1 N. Impedance changes (Draeger, Germany) were recorded by a 16-electrode belt placed at the level of the sixth intercostal space, and four horizontal, equally-sized regions of interest (ROIs) were defi ned for offl ine data analysis. Measurements were performed before (T-BL) and after lung injury (T-ALI). Lung tidal volume (Vt), pulmonary static compliance (C stat ), pulmonary mean artery pressure (mPAP), peak pressure (P p ), respiratory rate (RR) and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio were also recorded. Statistical analysis was based on two-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test for analysis of data within and between groups, and a t test was used analysis of impedance changes induced by ALI.

The purpose of this study was to monitor changes in lung impedance in a pig model of severe shock followed by fl uid resuscitation.

Animals were allocated to positive control (PC, n = 6) or treatment group with lactated Ringer's to achieve and maintain pulse pressure variation 13% and mean arterial pressure 65 mmHg (PPV, n = 6). Ventilatory and hemodynamic parameters were recorded at baseline, 1 hour after hemorrhagic shock (Tshock), and hourly for 3 hours (T1 to T3). A 16-electrode belt was placed at the level of the sixth intercostal space for EIT measurements (Dr\u00e4ger, Germany). Offl ine analysis was based on four horizontal regions of interest (ROIs) over the ventrodorsal lung area. Statistical analysis was based on two-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey test (P <0.05).",

Introduction Setting the optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the ICU is still a matter of debate. Talmor and colleagues used the transpulmonary pressure calculated from the oesophageal balloon to set PEEP in a recent randomized controlled study. This strategy aims at preventing alveolar collapse by counterbalancing the gravitational force of the lung by an equal or higher PEEP. We evaluated the relation between ventilation distribution measured by EIT and transpulmonary pressure during a PEEP trial in porcine ALI. Methods Eight pigs (30 kg) were studied during a PEEP trial before and after the induction of acute lung injury (ALI) with oleic acid. Global lung parameters, regional compliance, and oesophageal pressure were recorded at the end of each PEEP step. Regional compliance was calculated by dividing the tidal impedance variation (EIT Evaluation Kit 2; Dr\u00e4ger, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) by the applied driving pressure.",

Neutrophil elastase is thought to be one of the causes of ALI/ARDS, because it raises the pulmonary capillary permeability, lyses of pulmonary connective tissue proteins, and produces leukocyte chemotactic factors. However, a causal relationship between the plasma neutrophil elastase level and changes in the pulmonary capillary permeability has not been established in patients with pneumonia, one of the most serious diseases underlying ALI/ARDS. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether an increase in plasma neutrophil elastase is related to elevation of the pulmonary capillary permeability in patients with pneumonia. Methods Patients with pneumonia who were hospitalized from November 2008 to April 2009 and had PaO 2 \u226460 in room air with no need for mechanical ventilation were prospectively enrolled in the study. Plasma neutrophil elastase levels were collected via blood samples at baseline; 1, 3, and 7 days after the start of the study. Of those enrolled, patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 \u2264150 also had their extravascular lung water index (EVLWi) and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) monitored using the PiCCO system (Pulsion, Munich, Germany) when required by their attending physician.

After cannulation of the carotid artery was performed, a baseline blood gas sample was taken. Subsequently 0.5 ml of 10 5 cfu/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inoculated through the tracheotomy tube and PEEP was increased to 3 cmH 2 O and ventilated for 30 minutes before randomization.

The aim of our study was to develop a fl ow pattern that simultaneously produces locally diff erent alveolar pressures, in order to recruit collapsed alveoli and at the same time to prevent hyperinfl ation of already open alveoli. Methods We modifi ed Horsfi eld's model of the canine lung [1] to predict alveolar pressure diff erences between the collapsed and opened alveoli. The morphometric model has an asymmetrical branching airway system with 47 orders, whereby order 47 corresponds to the trachea. Each branch is terminated with a viscoelastic tissue unit and there are in total 150,077 acini for the whole model. Using this model, atelectasis of alveoli was simulated by reducing the diameter of small airways (order 1, 2 and 3) up to 90% of their original sizes. The tissue damping factor G was 10 4 times higher in the collapsed alveoli than that in normal alveoli. The shunt gas compression compliance C g for the alveolus was 10 6 times smaller. Diff erent percentages of atelectatic area from 0 to 90% were simulated. Flow distribution and airway input impedance were calculated at diff erent frequencies from 0.1 to 5 Hz. Alveolar pressure diff erences were obtained by analyzing the products of fl ow distribution and alveolar input impedance.",

Introduction Low tidal volumes (Vt) are thought to protect the lung by avoiding overdistension. We recently have shown that Vt may also infl uence repeated opening and closing (O/C) [1] . The goal of this study was to determine whether decreasing Vt from 6 to 4 ml/kg was eff ective to reduce O/C, and whether it was possible to maintain alveolar ventilation at such low Vt. Methods Cross-over study at two Vt levels: 6 versus 4 ml/kg IBW. We included ALI/ARDS patients, ventilated <48 hours, and who would have a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. For the 4 ml/kg arm: we replaced the heat and moisture exchange fi lter by a heated humidifi er, and the respiratory rate was increased to keep minute ventilation constant. The protocol had two parts: one bedside and other in the CT room. Both Vts were applied in a random order. For the bedside protocol each Vt arm was applied for 30 minutes. Data on lung mechanics and gas exchange were taken at baseline and 30 minutes. For the CT scan protocol each Vt arm was applied for 5 minutes and then a dynamic CT (4 images/second for 8 seconds) was taken at each Vt at a fi xed transverse region at the lower third of the lungs. Afterwards, CT images were analyzed by software (MALUNA) and repeated O/C was determined as nonaerated tissue variation between inspiration and expiration, expressed as a percentage of lung tissue weight.",

We hypothesized that severity of hypoxemia on admission after optimal ventilation may predict hospital outcome if the ARDS patients are categorised based on the primary etiology: pulmonary ARDS (ARDS p ) and extra pulmonary ARDS (ARDS exp ).

Introduction With adaptive support ventilation (ASV), a microprocessorcontrolled mode of mechanical ventilation, the ventilator adapts tidal volume (VT) size based on the Otis least work of breathing formula. In recent studies in patients with ALI/ARDS, ASV applied VT of 7.3 (6.7 to 8.8) ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW). It is unclear whether an open-lung approach was used in these studies. Lung recruitment improves lung compliance, and as a consequence may allow the ventilator to apply too large a VT with ASV. Methods Ten consecutive patients with ALI/ARDS, ventilated in accordance with our local protocol dictating frequent recruitment maneuvers, were observed while the ventilator was switched from pressure control ventilation (PC) to ASV. Thereafter, all patients were subjected to an additional standard recruitment procedure. The primary endpoint was VT before and after switch of the ventilator, and after standard recruitment. Results Four patients suff ered from ALI, six patients from ARDS. Seven patients had an extrapulmonary cause for ALI/ARDS. VT increased from 6.5 \u00b1 0.8 ml/kg IBW to 9.0 \u00b1 1.6 ml/kg IBW (P <0.01) after switch from PC to ASV. Additional recruitment after switch of the ventilator did not aff ect VT size (9.3 \u00b1 1.4 ml/kg IBW, P >0.05). In seven patients ASV applied VT >8 ml/kg IBW, in one patient VT even increased to >12 ml/kg IBW. Conclusions Patients with ALI/ARDS may be ventilated with too large a VT when subjected to ASV. Our results contrast fi ndings of previous studies on ASV in patients with ALI/ARDS, probably because we frequently use recruitment maneuvers. Conference criteria).

Introduction In animal models of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), mild hypothermia was found to be protective by reducing pulmonary infl ammation and possibly by reducing mechanical strain by applying lower respiratory rates. However, models are hampered by severe alkalosis or an ex vivo design. In a physiological model of VILI, we investigated whether hypothermia protects from VILI by reducing respiratory rates, or by reducing infl ammation. Methods In rats, VILI was induced using a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH 2 O and zero PEEP. Controls were ventilated with a PIP of 12 cmH 2 O and PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O.

This study was designed to investigate possible benefi ts of HS in the treatment of pigs submitted to experimental acute lung injury. Methods Twelve anesthetized, tracheotomized pigs (25 to 30 kg) were mechanically ventilated by pressure, adjusted to 8 ml/kg tidal volume, with FiO 2 50%, and submitted to intratracheal instillation of 4 ml/kg hydrochloric acid (HCl) 0.1 N. They were then randomized to ALI group (n = 7) or ALI + HS group (n = 5), where animals of the latter group received 4 ml/kg intravenous hypertonic saline, 15 minutes after injury. Hemodynamic parameters, pulmonary compliance (C stat ), peak pressure (P peak ), plateau pressure (P plat ) and tidal volume (V t ) were analyzed at baseline (TBL), 15 minutes after HCl instillation (TALI) and hourly thereafter for 4 hours (T0 to T3). Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at the end of the observation period for fl ow cytometry analysis of neutrophil burst activity. Postmortem histopathology of the right diaphragmatic lung was also performed in all animals. Results After TALI, animals of both groups presented signifi cant increases in P peak and P plat , and a decrease in C stat , at all time points, when compared with TBL. V t was preserved in both groups over time. There were signifi cant diff erences between groups ALI and ALI + HS, respectively, in: central venous pressure (T0, T1 and T2), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (T1 and T2) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (TALI). In the ALI group, signifi cant diff erences related to TBL were found in mean arterial pressure (T1), mean pulmonary artery pressure (TALI, T0, T1, T2 and T3) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (TALI, T0, T3). In the ALI + HS group, there were signifi cant diff erences related to TBL in mean arterial pressure (T0, T1, T2), mean pulmonary artery pressure (TALI, T0, T1, T2, T3), cardiac index (T0, T1, T2) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (T1, T2, T3).

Hyperproduction of infl ammatory mediators is one of the side eff ects in these cases. This factor could delay or prevent resolution of respiratory failure [1, 2] . However, it is not clear whether conventional mechanical ventilation damages intact lungs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the eff ects of conventional and protective mechanical ventilation on intact lungs in patients with severe trauma. Methods A prospective, randomized controlled trial in trauma patients with mechanical ventilation for extrapulmonary indications. The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Seventy-eight patients were randomized to conventional (Vt 10 to 12 ml/kg IBW, PEEP 5 cmH 2 O -n = 39) or protective (Vt 5 to 6 ml/kg IBW, PEEP 10 cmH 2 O -n = 39) mechanical ventilation. TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels in plasma and BAL fl uids were measured on 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days of MV. Frequency of ALI (AECC criteria) and VAP were evaluated. The endpoints of this study were the length of MV, LOS in ICU and outcome on 28 days. Results In fi rst 3 days ALI was revealed in 26 patients (66.6%) in the conventional and 10 patients (26.5%) in the protective MV groups (P = 0.001; OR 4.375, 95% CI 2.227 to 8.189). ARDS occurred in four patients (10,2%) of the conventional MV group (LIS >2) and no one in the protective MV group (P <0.0001). Levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in BAL fl uids were signifi cantly higher in the conventional MV group from 1 to 7 days with maximal increase on day 3 (542 \u00b1 44/91 \u00b1 11; 315 \u00b1 35/86 \u00b1 10; 1,092 \u00b1 160/111 \u00b1 18, P <0.0001). No diff erences were found in levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in plasma samples. VAP occurred in 31 patients (83.7%) of the conventional and nine patients (23%) of the protective MV groups (P = 0.0001; OR 17.2, 95% CI 5.5 to 54.3). The length of MV was 17.4 \u00b1 6 vs 12.8 \u00b1 3 (P = 0.0001; OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 11.5), LOS in the ICU was 21.9 \u00b1 5.6 vs 15.75 \u00b1 2.9 (P = 0.0002; OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.18 to 23.6).

We hypothesized that VC with higher VT would signifi cantly unload and deactivate the diaphragm, whereas NAVA would not. Methods Seven intubated C3 to C7 SCI patients (age: 28 \u00b1 12 years) were studied. Using VC (Servo300), VT was increased progressively (not exceeding 40 cmH 2 O or 2 l VT) (high volume) and then lowered until 6 ml/kg or intolerance (low volume). NAVA was then progressively adjusted targeting similar peak pressures. Finally subjects received 15 minutes each of: high VC, low VC, high NAVA, and low NAVA in randomized order. Results Despite comparable increases in peak airway pressure (Pmo), VT increased with VC but was unaltered with NAVA. Inspiratory and total breath durations were lower and respiratory rate higher with NAVA compared with VC during both assist levels. VC resulted in signifi cant diaphragm unloading and deactivation whereas both were maintained during high and low NAVA. Complete diaphragm deactivation in more than 80% of breaths was observed during VC in fi ve of the patients. Introduction A novel methodology is proposed to adapt decisionmaking strategies into our fuzzy-based expert system, AUTOPILOT-BT [1] . The special features of this approach are: knowledge from clinical experts can be extracted in a setup simulating daily ICU routine; an automated process serves to obtain the required information and to create new fuzzy sets; and the fuzzy controller from AUTOPILOT-BT employs the newly derived fuzzy rules. Thus, the knowledge base can easily be modifi ed and the resulting mechanical ventilation therapies may be adapted to individual preferences of the clinician. Methods The methodology consists of: (i) Acquisition of decision-making strategies from single or groups of anesthesiologists. This can either be done with a questionnaire or with a PC-based program simulating the doctors every day situation in diagnosis.

Introduction Respiratory muscle weakness is an important risk factor for prolonged mechanical ventilation, and may be part of critical illness related polyneuropathy and myopathy. Animal data also strongly point to atrophy and weakness of the diaphragm due to mechanical ventilation itself, called ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction. Recently, measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure following magnetic stimulation (TwPdi BAMPS) was introduced in the ICU to evaluate diaphragm function [1, 2] . We aimed to evaluate reproducibility of twitch TwPdi BAMPS in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients. We also aimed to describe the relationship between TwPdi and duration of mechanical ventilation. Methods Prospective observational study in a medical ICU of a university hospital. TwPdi BAMPS was measured in critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients. Briefl y, the phrenic nerves were stimulated bilaterally from the anterior approach, at the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, at the level of the cricoids using two fi gureof-eight 45 mm magnetic coils (Magstim, Dyfed, Wales) and a bistim (Magstim, Dyfed, Wales). A custom-built occlusion valve was used to create isometric conditions during stimulation. Oesophageal and abdominal pressure changes were measured using balloon catheters (UK Medical, Sheffi eld, UK) inserted through the nose after local anaesthesia.",

All patients independent from the underlying cause were treated with high-dose intravenous steroids, 69 patients with antihistamines, 33 with epinephrine (inhalation or i.m.), two patients with ACEI-induced AE were successfully treated with icatibant. Ten patients needed an intubation, 11 a tracheotomy, one patient an emergency coniotomy to preserve the airway. All 11 tracheotomy patients suff ered from cancer. Nine out of 10 intubated patients took an ACEI and were extubated on the ICU after 2 to 7 days. Conclusions According to our experience 80% of the patients with laryngeal swelling and upper airway obstruction react well to the standard therapy with steroids, epinephrine and antihistamines, indicating that the AE is histamine induced. In contrast these drugs have almost no eff ect on bradykinin-induced angioedema; that is, AE induced by ACEI. There is preliminary evidence that the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist icatibant that is approved for treatment of HAE type I and II may also be eff ective in ACEI-induced edema. Forty-six laryngoscopes were tested. All had traditional vacuum incandescent bulbs. Twelve (26%) fell below 1,000 Lux and six (13%) fell below the 500 Lux minimum. The failures were corrected by battery replacement in 25% and by bulb replacement in the remaining 75% (see Figure 1 ). Conclusions Simply checking laryngoscopes for the presence of illumination on a regular basis is insuffi cient to ensure best or even adequate function. Poor function is as frequently related to bulb dysfunction as battery fatigue. Institutions should consider quality control and maintenance programs or consider more advanced laryngoscopic lighting (for example, LED or halogen bulbs). References (Table 1) .

Introduction Mechanically ventilated (MV) patients are prone to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia. One of the major risk factors is microaspirations of supraglottic secretions past the endotracheal tube cuff (usually in polyvinyl (PV)). A novel polyurethane (PUE) cuff was designed to minimize these leakages. We therefore compared the sealing capacities of the two tubes in MV patients. Methods Twenty-nine consecutive MV patients (mean age \u00b1 SD: 68 \u00b1 13, 21 males), were randomly allocated to receive either a PV (HI-LO Evac, Mallinckrodt) or a PUE (SEALGUARD Evac, Mallinckrodt) cuff ed endotracheal tube (size: 9 for men; 8 or 8.5 for women, as a rule). We excluded patients with emergency intubation, unstable haemodynamics, severe respiratory failure or patients with history of tracheal/laryngeal disease. In each patient, cuff pressure was maintained at 30 cmH 2 O, and ventilator parameters were set to plateau pressure \u226430 cmH 2 O; patients were fasting and placed in a strict semirecumbent position (45\u00b0). Radioactivity of tracheal aspirates was assessed sequentially (hourly samplings from T0 to T6 hours, then T8 hours and T12 hours) after injection of 74 MBq 99m Tc-DTPA diluted in 5 ml of 0.9% NaCl just above the cuff via the aspiration channel of the tube. Additionally, kinetics of respiratory tract contamination was followed by simultaneous pulmonary images using a scintillation camera. Data were blindly analysed by nuclear physicians. The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from relatives. Results Sixteen PUE and 13 PV cuff ed tubes were compared. The study was performed 3.2 \u00b1 2.8 days after intubation and 8.3 \u00b1 9.6 days after ICU admission (mean \u00b1 SD). Ventilator parameters were the following: volume control or pressure support but one on T tube, FiO 2 was 0.43 \u00b1 0.14, PEEP 6 \u00b1 2 cmH 2 O. Leakages were observed in 11/29 patients (38%), with similar rate of aspiration in PUE (5/16) and PV (6/13) groups (P = NS). Leakages were more frequently observed in female (7/8) than in male patients (4/21) (P <0.001). There was a trend to decreased frequency of aspiration in patients with larger tubes (size 9 vs 8.5: P = 0.062).",

Introduction For decades it was assumed that cuff ed endotracheal tubes prevented aspiration. However, currently used cuff ed tubes do not prevent the development of post-intubation pulmonary complications caused by microaspiration [1, 2] . A new taper-shaped cuff ed tube (TaperGuard (TG)) has recently been introduced. The aim of this study was to compare this tube with a traditional tube (Hi-Lo (HL)) in an aspiration pig model. Methods Fourteen pigs between 65 and 75 kg were studied. The pigs were randomly intubated with either TaperGuard (tapered cuff ) or Hi-Lo (barrel cuff ) tubes. The tube size was either 7.0 or 8.5 depending on weight. Cuff pressures were maintained between 24 and 27 cm water. After intubation, 0.3 ml/kg acidic blue dye (ph 2.5) was placed on top of the cuff . The animals were ventilated for 3 hours. The animals were then sacrifi ced and the tracheobronchial tree and lungs examined. Aspiration was characterized as follows: dye leak, ulceration/erosion, hemorrhagic pneumonia, bronchitis/bronchiolitis.",

We investigated whether the RSBI could be a useful parameter in our patient population. Methods From June 2008 until March 2009 all patients who had been mechanically ventilated on our six-bed ICU were studied. Only the patients who were invasively mechanically ventilated, for longer than 6 hours, who had no missing information and did not die whilst on the ventilator were included in this study. RSBIs were measured by these patients at two diff erent time points of weaning, fi rstly at the point of reduction in pressure support and then at the point of extubation. The RSBI was measured using the ventilator (Maquet servo-i) by reducing the pressure support level to zero and adjusting the PEEP to 5 cmH 2 O. A signifi cance level <0.05 was considered signifi cant. The nonparametric Kruskall-Wallis test was used to analyse the collected data. Results One hundred and nineteen patients were ventilated over this time period: 74 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria; 45 were included. At the time point of further reduction in pressure support, the RSBI showed signifi cant diff erences (P = 0.038) between the group who was ready for weaning and the group who was not ready for weaning. In the group with successful reduction of PS (n = 28) the RSBI was 83.54 \u00b1 32.12, and in the group without successful reduction of PS (n = 2) the RSBI was 158.50 \u00b1 38.89. At the point of extubation the RSBI was signifi cant in predicting successful extubation (P <0.001). In the group who was successfully extubated (n = 24) the RSBI was 75.25 \u00b1 21.62, and in the group who was unsuccessfully extubated (n = 5) the RSBI was 155.20 \u00b1 25.23.

W Naue, A Guntzel, A Silva, R Condessa, R Oliveira, S Vieira Methods After being placed in the supine position in bed, with head angle elevation at 30\u00b0, patients were randomized to: group 1 (G1): vibrocompression for 10 minutes in the chest, or group 2 (G2): vibrocompression plus increase of 10 cmH 2 O in IP in PSV for 10 minutes in the chest. Clinical variables and APACHE II score were registered. Parameters analyzed at the beginning (1) and at the end (2) of the protocol were: variation of peak pressure (\u0394PP = Pp2 -Pp1), variation of tidal volume (\u0394VT = VT2 -VT1), variation of dynamic compliance (\u0394Cdyn = Cdyn2 -Cdyn1). The amount of variation of mucus secretion aspirated (\u0394Sa = Sa2 -Sa1) at the end was also measured. The results are showed in mean \u00b1 SD.

Conclusions We found no diff erences between groups, except in peak pressure (Pp2 >Pp1) that was greater in G1. This result could be probably due to decreased airway resistance. References Introduction Failure in weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) is frequent (25 to 30%) and associated with high mortality. Indexes predicting success can be helpful clinically. However their predictive capacity can be low, principally in patients with cardiac disease. The goal of this study is to evaluate weaning predictor indexes in patients with cardiac disease during weaning from MV. Methods We included patients with and without cardiac disease under MV for at least 48 hours, submitted to spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for 30 minutes, extubated according to clinical decision and followed for 48 hours. They were evaluated concerning age, sex, clinical characteristics, length of hospital and ICU stay and of MV. At the fi rst and 30th minutes from SBT there were analyzed: arterial blood gases, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters as respiratory rate (f ), tidal volume (VT), rapid shallow breathing index (f/VT), maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Comparisons were done between this group of patients and success x failure, defi ning failure as a return to MV in the fi rst 48 hours. Results Four hundred and thirteen patients were studied, 81 with cardiac disease and 332 without. Overall mortality rate was 14%. Return to MV occurred in 19.7%. The most important diff erences comparing patients with cardiac disease with the control group were: lower mortality rate (21% x 13.5%, P <0.006), shorter length of ICU stay (9 \u00b1 3 x 16 \u00b1 13 days). Comparing patients who failed in the weaning process with and without heart disease (20% x 20%, P <0.55). Comparing f/VT in 30th minute of patients who have had success with those who failed the weaning process (60 \u00b1 38 x 74 \u00b1 47, P <0.012), a lower increase in f/VT (\u0394f/VT) (4 \u00b1 27 x 11 \u00b1 33, P <0.075) during the test. Conclusions In this group of patients a great number failed in the weaning process, showing, as expected, a higher mortality rate. Parameters most related to failure in the literature were higher age, longer length of ICU stay, mortality and f/VT. In this study, just the last parameter was sensitive principally in the 30th minute, and higher increase in f/VT (\u0394f/VT) during the test, demonstrating that patients with cardiac disease not fail more than others during the weaning process, as well as the effi ciency of the test to predict success in weaning.",

            "text": "Introduction Due to the improvement of nearly all fi elds of acute care in the past decades, the burden of long-term dependency from mechanical ventilation (MV) increases incessantly. The aim of this study was to implement and test a standardised weaning protocol in patients suff ering from long-term mechanical ventilation. Methods After approval by the local ethics committee and informed consent, 644 patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study in 1 year. The mean time on the ventilator before inclusion was 39.4 (6 to 357) days. The reasons for long-term MV were: cerebral 33.1%; cardiovascular 31.5%; pulmonary 28.7% and 5.6% neuromuscular diseases. The weaning protocol started with 6 x 5 minutes spontaneous breathing (intermission of mechanical ventilation) on day 1 and was increased stepwise up to 24 hours spontaneous breathing on day 22. If there was no improvement in weaning steps over 5 days or there were more than three steps backwards the patient was switched to the individual weaning approach. The weaning protocol was carried out by the previously trained ICU staff as well as by specialized physiotherapists. Results A total of 77.3% (n = 498) of the patients could be weaned off the ventilator by the fi rst eff ort. Out of these, 85.9% of the patients were weaned by the protocol whereas 14.1% needed an individual approach. The mean time of weaning was 17 (5 to 67) days using the protocol and 29 (1 to 88) days due to the individual approach. In 12.6% both weaning procedures failed and these patients were discharged from the hospital into a home-care ventilation program. In total, 10.1% of the patients died on mechanical ventilation during their ICU stay. Patients who had needed a second weaning eff ort (n = 111) were weaned in 36.4% by the protocol, transferred to home-care ventilation (28.8%) or died (35.1%). Conclusions Using the standardised weaning protocol, more than three-quarters of the prolonged mechanically ventilated patients could be weaned off the ventilator in a mean of 17 days. Only 14.1% needed an individual strategy that takes 29 days until complete release from the ventilator. Therefore we suggest this kind of weaning protocol as a useful Introduction This study compared the reliability and the effi cacy of three diff erent non-invasive CPAP systems, Ventumask\u00ae low fl ow (LF), Ventumask\u00ae high fl ow (HF) and Boussignac\u00ae CPAP valve (B), both in a lung model and in healthy subjects. Methods Lung model: pneumatic simulator fi rst set at respiratory rate 16/ minute with 400 ml tidal volume (L1), then RR 40/minute with 800 ml tidal volume (L2). Human study: 10 healthy subjects were asked to make an expiratory pause (T1), fi ve breaths at tidal volume (T2), and a short sequence of tachypnea (T3). The diff erences between set and eff ective PEEP and FiO 2 were used as indexes of reliability. The minimum airway pressure below the PEEP level and the airway pressure swing around PEEP were used as indexes of effi cacy. In the lung simulator protocol, the pressure-time product was measured and then correlated to the other effi cacy indexes. Results Lung model: HF showed a tendency towards a more stable PEEP (P = 0.067). In B a signifi cant fall in the FiO 2 value from L1 (96.9 (95.5; 97.6)%) to L2 (54.2 (50.4; 56.9)%) was observed (P <0.001). The airway pressure swing around PEEP was greater in LF and B compared with HF in L1 (P <0.001), while during L2 it was lower in B (P = 0.007). The pressure-time product was better described by the airway pressure swing around PEEP (r 2 = 0.95) rather than the minimum airway pressure below the PEEP level (r 2 = 0.85). Human study: a lower diff erence between set and eff ective FiO 2 was registered with HF (P <0.001). Ventumask\u00ae systems showed an overall higher minimum airway pressure below the PEEP level compared with B (P <0.001). During T3, HF (+10.1 (+7.4; +13.2) cmH 2 O) showed a smaller airway pressure swing around PEEP relative to LF (+11.9 (+10.1; +16.6) cmH 2 O, P <0.001) but not to B (+12.2 (+6.6; +15.1) cmH 2 O, P = 0.40). During the whole respiratory sequence, an increase in end-expiratory pressure was observed. This increase was greater in B valve than in HF and LF (P <0.001). Conclusions According to observations, HF seemed to be the most reliable device. In conditions of high fl ow demand, B reached FiO 2 values lower than expected. The dynamic hyper-pressurization, higher with B, is probably due to the relationship between expiratory fl ow and the resistance off ered by the expiratory valve. B, even if handy and lightweight, is less reliable in terms of fl ow supply and PEEP stability. Introduction Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) has been used in hypoxic postoperative cardiac patients but more studies are necessary to clarify its respiratory and hemodynamic eff ects. Therefore, our objective was to study its eff ects in the oxygenation index (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and in hemodynamic variables in this group of patients. Methods This is a randomized trial in which all postoperative cardiac patients having a pulmonary artery catheter and showing a PaO 2 /FiO 2 between 150 and 300 (with FIO 2 0.31), 1 hour after extubation, were included. The intervention group used NIV with a bilevel positive airway pressure (an inspiratory pressure to generate a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg and an expiratory pressure of 7 cmH 2 O) with FIO 2 0.4 during 3 hours. The control group used oxygen by Venturi mask in order to keep good oxygenation. In both groups, measurements were done in a basal situation (FiO 2 0.31), in the fi rst hour after beginning the treatment (FiO 2 0.4) and 1 hour after the end of the intervention (FiO 2 0.31). Variables studied included: pH, PaO 2 , PaCO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), central venous pressure (CVP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) and cardiac output (CO). Results Forty-two patients were included in the study period. The mean age was 65.7 \u00b1 10 years. The basal variables were similar in the two groups. There was an increase in the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in the NIV group in the fi rst hour (P <0.05, 95% CI 74.8 to 6.6) and 1 hour after stopping the treatment (P <0.05, 95% CI 90.7 to 10.8) compared with the control group. There were no signifi cant changes in hemodynamic parameters, pH and PaCO 2 during NIV compared with the control group. Conclusions There were no changes in hemodynamic variables during the NIV period. However, these results suggest that NIV improved oxygenation even 1 hour after stopping the treatment.",

The criteria for selecting patients for NIPPV included a combination of the following factors: patients with acute respiratory failure, haemodynamically stable, conscious and cooperative with their treatment. There had to be no need for endotracheal intubation. Results Thirty-one patients were treated with NIPPV. Nineteen were female. Mean age was 44.22 years, mean total body surface area (TBSA) was 38.37%. NIPPV was used to treat hypoxia in 21 patients, hypercapnia in four patients and both of them in six patients. The mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio before NIPPV was 188.53. NIPPV was used to treat ARDS in 12 patients, pneumonia in eight patients, atelectasis in six patients and cardiogenic oedema in fi ve patients. The mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio after NIPPV was 256.43. Intubation was successfully avoided in 12 out of the 31 (38.7%) patients.

The variation of CI depended on the variation of stroke volume (SV), while the heart rate (HR) did not change during the trial.

The variation of CI and DO 2 , observed within and among the two groups was never signifi cant. Conclusions Both groups of patients were successful in achieving spontaneous ventilation. In our opinion, continuous hemodynamic monitoring may provide helpful beat-to-beat information and it might be used, combined with the gas exchange and oxygen saturation monitoring, during the weaning process as a predictor of cardiovascular instability or respiratory failure. Moreover, continuous hemodynamic monitoring enables one to be aware of the variation of systemic oxygen delivery, and these data could be used to value critically ill patients during the weaning process. Introduction Obesity rates are increasing in the general population and it is also prevalent in ICUs. Patients are sometimes admitted to ICUs for hypercapnic respiratory failure or cor pulmonale but in general they are admitted for pneumonia, excessive daytime sleepiness, heart failure, COPD or asthma attacks or pulmonary embolism; and hypercapnic respiratory failure is noticed during this period. On the other hand, optimal non-invasive mechanical ventilation strategy is not known during their ICU treatment. The aim of this study is to assess the diff erences between NIV strategies and outcomes between obese and nonobese patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, 73 patients were studied and all of them were ventilated with a face mask. Patients divided into two groups as obese (BMI >35 kg/m 2 ) and nonobese (BMI <35 kg/m 2 ), and whether necessary pressure, volume, mode, ventilator and time to reduce PaCO 2 below 50 mmHg were signifi cantly diff erent in obese and nonobese patients was investigated. Results Mean age of the patients was 66 \u00b1 14 years and mean admission APACHE II score was 18 \u00b1 4; 41 (56%) of them were female. ICU admission reasons for the obese patients were signifi cantly more frequently pulmonary edema and less frequently pulmonary infections (P = 0.003 and 0.043, respectively) than the nonobese patients. While there were no signifi cant diff erences across the groups between the ventilators, modes, and inspiratory pressure levels, obese patients required higher end-expiratory pressure levels and more time to reduce the PaCO 2 level below 50 mmHg than the nonobese group. Length of NIV and ICU stay, intubation and the mortality rate were similar across the groups. Conclusions These results suggest that improvement of hypercapnia in obese patients may require higher PEEP levels and longer times than the non-obese ones during acute hypercapnic respiratory failure attack.",

We introduced a new severity scoring system to our ICU. The aim of this report is to describe the database and present the results of the fi rst 12 months. Methods We analysed needs for database and severity scoring. We chose on-admission scoring with EUROSCORE for cardiac surgical patients, and Mortality Prediction Model II time zero for other patients. Data were collected via highly simplifi ed forms onto a spreadsheet. Demographic entry was by ward clerk, on-admission severity scoring was by resident medical staff , and risk of death calculation and data cleaning was by senior attending medical staff . Individual patient risk of death was presented as a logit. Combined risk of death for the whole cohort was calculated from the arithmetic mean of individual logits. We estimated the time to completion of each step in data acquisition to calculate a total time spent per patient. Results There were 1,355 admissions, mean (SD) age 69.2 (15.9) years, 57.1% male; median (range) length of stay 23.1 (1.7 to 1,882.5) hours. Fiftyfour per cent of patients were ventilated for a median (range) 7.5 (0.8 to 1,877) hours. Predicted mortality for cardiothoracic and noncardiothoracic patients combined was 8.64% and the observed mortality was 2.8%. EUROSCORE-predicted mortality for the 535 cardiothoracic patients was 5.72% and the observed mortality was 0.75% (four patients). MPMpredicted mortality for the 820 noncardiothoracic patients was 11.23% and the observed mortality was 4% (34 patients). Estimated time to complete the severity scoring form was 30 seconds, to enter a new patient on the database was 90 seconds and to calculate risk of death and check data integrity was 90 seconds. Total was 3.5 minutes per patient. Conclusions Data collection/analysis is essential for quality management in the ICU. Proprietary systems are expensive. Traditional scoring systems (APACHE II) are poorly calibrated to some case mixes. To overcome these problems, we devised a simple, inexpensive and highly valuable ICU database. The key features were well calibrated, on-admission severity scoring, highly simplifi ed forms, a basic spreadsheet and collaborative staff involvement. Senior medical staff performed the fi nal data checking. The project provided abundant high-quality data with a total input of 3.5 minutes per patient. We are trialling the database in a large ICU in China and we would welcome input from other ICUs that would like to copy our methods.",

Eleven of these patients had a SOFA score higher than 9 during 5 days or more. In the SOFA(+) group, LOS (22.6 \u00b1 13.1 vs 10.8 \u00b1 6.9 days) and mortality (55% vs 33%) are signifi cantly higher (P <0.05). The mortality of 55% is in good agreement with the predicted IGSII mortality but far less than the 100% predicted by Cabr\u00e9 and colleagues. Conclusions A SOFA score higher than 9 for at least 5 days in patients older than 60 years seems useless to defi ne futility in our patient population. It is applicable to only less than 3% of the 430 patients admitted in 2007. The mortality rate of the SOFA(+) group increased but remained far from values permitting to withdraw or withhold intensive care. A weakness of the use of sequential SOFA score to predict outcome is that some therapeutic options can infl uence the value of the SOFA score. Introduction Prolonged ICU stay is associated with high morbidity, mortality and costs [1, 2] . Prediction of this prolonged stay will provide information for physician and family and help with resource allocation. Even though, available severity scoring system ie. APACHE II, APACHE III, MPM, SAPS II, MODS scores are widely accepted for evaluating outcomes in the ICU population. But these models might be inaccurate when apply to subpopulation and might not predict prolonged length of stay. Conclusions All three scores are useful prognostic factors for mortality and for ICU therapy in the ED, with usually lower patients' severity of infection than in the ICU. The ICU-validated APACHE II and SOFA scores were of similar prognostic value as the ED-specifi c MEDS score.",

Each parameter is subdivided into four classes, scored from 0 to 3 points. Scores of each class are summed to obtain the EMTRAS, ranging from 0 to 12. Here we present preliminary results of a study with the aim to validate this new scoring system and to compare it with other commonly used illness scores. Methods One hundred and fi fty trauma patients admitted to the regional referral trauma center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy) were studied. Predictive value of the EMTRAS score was compared with the Injury Severity Score (ISS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Trauma Injury Introduction Severe sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality following major surgery. Factors that are associated with an increased risk of sepsis following surgery include emergency surgery, patient co-morbidities, allogeneic blood transfusion and degree of surgical insult [1] . Physiological track-and-trigger systems are widely used to identify deteriorating patients. The Modifi ed Early Warning System (MEWS) is one such system, but has not been studied in regard to predicting the development of sepsis after surgery. Although high MEWS scores are associated with increased hospital mortality, the sensitivity of MEWS and other physiological track and trigger scores for predicting death or admission to intensive care is low [2] . Methods We carried out a prospective cohort study on 101 patients undergoing elective major surgery in a large university teaching hospital. The patients were followed up for 10 days, and the incidence of sepsis and septic shock was documented. MEWS scores were recorded daily for each patient. Admissions to critical care were documented, along with critical care length of stay.",

Factors associated with the development of sepsis were intraoperative blood transfusion (P = 0.013), duration of operation (P = 0.004) and a postoperative MEWS score greater than 3 (P = 0.0003). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, a MEWS score greater than 3 after surgery was the only factor that remained signifi cantly associated with sepsis (odds ratio 4.89, P = 0.003). Although a high MEWS score was associated with sepsis after surgery, only fi ve (19%) patients who developed sepsis had an abnormal MEWS score prior to (mean 4.6 days) sepsis being diagnosed. In the post-CCO group 10 of the 27 patients were admitted to the ICU and 17 of these were treated in hematology ward, and nine of these received NIV (Figure 1 ). We defi ned six criteria for activation of the CCO team: radiological signs of pneumonia, organ increased by 116% (n = 65; type 1 MI: 54%; type 2 MI: 46%; P <0.05). Type 1 MI increased by 75%, which was refl ected by a 57% decrease of patients formerly classifi ed as instable angina. Of note, increases of MI diagnosis were mainly refl ected by a 200% increase of type 2 MI (for example, acute heart failure, tachycardia or hypertensive crisis). Numbers of patients with noncardiac chest pain were not signifi cantly changed with the use of the new cutoff point. AUC of admission cTnT levels were 0.76 and 0.96 for the cTnT fourth generation and cTnThs (P <0.05). At admission, sensitivity and specifi city of cTnThs were 93% and 94% for the detection of acute MI, while they were 32% and 96% using cTnT fourth generation. Conclusions Using lower cutoff points for the defi nition of MI as suggested by current recommendations, the rate of chest pain patients with acute MI doubled. Because the increased rate of patients categorized as acute MI is mainly refl ected MI type 2, the ED triage decision at lower cutoff levels of cTnT levels should include patient history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG and cardiac imaging.",

The presence of B+ line artifacts on lung US is correlated with increased extravascular lung water. In patients with acute decompensated heart failure the resolution of B+ lines can be used to monitor resolution of pulmonary congestion. A simple nine-point comet score has been proposed to quantify B+ lines and monitor ACPE treatment [1] . Methods Twenty-one patients with ACPE were submitted to lung US and BGA on presentation at 2 and 24 hours after admission. Lung US was done in nine thoracic areas and scored one point if B+ lines were present. A score of 10 was given for the presence of multiple coalesced comets in all fi elds (white lung). BGA values were used to calculate PO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) and A-a gradient. Results A total of 64 scans were performed with simultaneous BGA. Ninety-eight percent of patients presenting with white lung were severely hypoxic (PO 2 <50 mmHg; P/F <200). Figure 1 illustrates a strong linear correlation between reduction in comet score and improvement in P/F (r = -0.73; P <0.001). A decrease in comet score of 2 points corresponded to a minimum increase of 20 points in P/F (P <0.05). The correlation between comet score and A-a gradient was less striking signifi cant (r = -0.51; P = 0.05), perhaps because patients with underlying lung disease were not excluded from this pilot study. Conclusions There is a strong negative correlation between lung comet score and gas exchange in patients with ACPE. In these patients, serial thoracic US may reduce the need for repeated invasive BGA monitoring and further help tailor therapy. Reference ",

Introduction Exacerbation of asthma can appear during air transport. Severe patients, not responding to conventional therapy can require ventilator support. We evaluated the performance of two transport ventilators, built with turbine technology -the T-bird VSO2 and the LTV 1000 -for use during aeromedical evacuation of acute severe asthma. We have assessed the ability of both ventilators to deliver to an acute severe asthma model a tidal volume (Vt) set at diff erent simulated altitudes, by changing the ambient air pressure. Methods We used a decompression chamber to mimic the hypobaric environment at a range of simulated cabin altitudes of 1,500, 2,500 and 3,000 meters (4,000, 6,670, 8,000 feet). Ventilators were tested with realistic parameters. Vt was set at 700 ml and 400 ml in an acute severe asthma lung model. The protocol included three measurements for each simulated altitude. Comparisons of preset to actual measured values were accomplished using a t test for each altitude.",

Data for all investigations requested within 2 hours from admission were analyzed. Results From 1 November 2007 to 31 October 2009, 743 MT patients were admitted to the ED. EUs was performed in 515 patients (69%), total body CT scan in 679 (91%).

Thirty-eight patients had a chest X-ray taken in the ED (5.1%), 11 (1.5%) a pelvic X-ray and only three a cervical spine X-ray. Conclusions Although many international guidelines for trauma care still recommend traditional plain radiographic investigations, our TC as well as many other European institutions with a high volume of trauma patients have adopted a diff erent strategy based on the extended use of EUs and CT scan. This may improve the accuracy of the diagnosis in the stabilized patients and reduce time to the operating room in the highly instable ones.

Hypernatraemia was defi ned as a twice elevation of the plasma sodium level over 149 mmol/l within 24 hours, while polyuria was defi ned as an increase in the hourly diuresis of more than 3 ml/kg/hour in no less than 6 hours.",

The duration of the period of hypernatraemia in Group C was 4.5 days with max 181.1 mmol/l and average 161 \u00b1 4.7 mmol/l. Polyuria was diagnosed in 15.5% of the cases. The highest diuresis in this group was 4.1 mmol/kg/hour, mean 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 ml/kg/hour. Such changes were considered a manifestation of CDI. All 12 patients in Group C received desmopressin (DDAVP) for more than 48 hours (mean 56.8 \u00b1 4. 5 hours). The doses were 0.025 to 0.2 mg/day. In four out of 14 children in Group B (29%), an increase hourly diuresis up to 3 ml/kg/hour was considered the onset of CDI; thus, they were also prescribed DDAVP. Unfavorable outcomes (GOS score 1 to 3) during a 30-day assessment were observed only in Groups B and C. In a comparison of unsuccessful outcomes between Groups B and C, there was an increase in the unfavorable outcome rate in patients of Group C (with hypernatraemia and polyuria) -10 children (84%) and Group Bfour children (28%). The risk factor in the comparison between patients of Groups B and C was 0.3, P <0.05. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that hypernatraemia increases the rate of unfavorable outcomes in children with TBI. Thirty-day outcomes were worse with CDI patients. Presumably, the used of DDAVP prevents dehydration and CDI advance. Introduction Secondary ischemic insult after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is correlated with poor outcome.

Introduction After traumatic brain injury (TBI), structural lesions are heterogeneous, but the spatial heterogeneity of consequences of insults as hypoxia-hypotension (HH) and/or TBI has never been studied. The objective of this study was to compare the eff ect of standardized insults (HH, TBI and both) on brain energy metabolism in two diff erent regions: frontal cortex and thalamus. Methods Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups: Sham, TBI (impact acceleration alone, 450 g weight drop from 1.8 m), HH (blood depletion to mean arterial pressure 40 mmHg, FiO 2 10%, 15 minutes) and TBI-HH (TBI followed by HH, 45 minute delay). Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was continuously and invasively measured. Brain microdialysis and PtiO 2 probes were both inserted stereotaxically in the right thalamus and frontal cortex.",

During the hour following the HH period, a signifi cant increase in cerebral lactate/pyruvate ratio (Figure 1 ), glycerol and glutamate was observed. This increase was higher in the cortex than in the thalamus in all groups subjected to HH (P <0.001). In the TBI-HH groups, the increase in glycerol in the cortex was signifi cantly higher compared with the HH group (P <0.001), as well as thalamic and cortical glutamate. During 15 minutes following the HH phase (after reinjection and reoxygenation), an increase in PtiO 2 was observed in the cortex and thalamus, but with diff erent profi les (lower increase in the cortex) ( Figure 1 ). Conclusions Diff erent profi les of cerebral response to HH and TBI were observed with higher sensitivity in the cortex than in the thalamus. The post-ischemic hyperemia seems to be altered in the traumatized cortex but conserved into the thalamus and nontraumatized brain. Introduction Decompressive craniectomy is indicated for treatment of severe intracranial hypertension. However, this procedure is invasive and potentially associated with complications. We present a preliminary result of a study comparing early and late decompressive craniectomy in severe traumatic brain injury. Methods Patients studied were all admitted to the ICU of a tertiary referral center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy) during 4 years (2005 to 2009). In total, data of 62 brain-injured patients, who underwent decompressive craniectomy, were retrospectively examined and included in two groups based on decompressive craniectomy execution: early decompressive craniectomy group (decompressive craniectomy performed within 24 hours after brain injury, group A; n = 41) and late decompressive craniectomy (later than 24 hours, group B; n = 21). For all patients, demographic, scores, clinical data, length of stay and fi nal outcome were collected from the institutional database. Traumatic lesions were compared at admission using the Marshall score and 24 hours after decompressive craniectomy execution with CT scan. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 6 months was also collected.",

Before the study, they were educated about CPR and performed ECC for 5 minutes on the resuscitation manikin in two diff erent situations; on the fl oor and in the dental chair. On separate days, they repeated these ECC procedures on the fl oor and in the dental chair again. The depth of compression and the percentage of adequate compression were evaluated. In addition, each participant commented on the preferable situation in the questionnaire after each set of ECC. Results Four dental personnel performed ECC fi ve times on the fl oor and fi ve times in the dental chair and commented on the preferable setting fi ve times. The effi cacy of ECC was evaluated by the average depth and the percentage of ECC with adequate depth; 39.8 \u00b1 8.2 mm and 46.8 \u00b1 48.8% on the fl oor and 34.4 \u00b1 6.9 mm and 41.7 \u00b1 42.7% in the dental chair. The percentage of ECC with adequate depth was higher for the fl oor setting than that of the dental chair setting, although it did not reach statistical signifi cance (P = 0.079). In the 20 questionnaires, three of them preferred the dental chair setting, two of them were no diff erence between both settings and 15 of them preferred the fl oor setting.",

Introduction Today, the emergency medical service (EMS) system has been developing in each country. However, it is not known whether people are willing to perform CPR and whether they are prepared to perform CPR under telephone CPR advice. In this study, we examined how Japanese citizens are interested in the importance of immediate CPR and defi brillation, and how they understand this importance. Methods Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to nontraumatic etiology treated in our center for the past 2 years were enrolled. Cardiac arrest after the scene was excluded. Patients' records from our emergency department were reviewed. In Japan, the ambulance service, dispatch service and emergency life-saving technician (ELST) belong to the fi re department. ELSTs perform not only advanced CPR for CPA patients on the job but also education of call takers in the central operation center under medical control about the importance of the recognition of CPA and advice for immediate bystander CPR. Results A total of 747 patients were enrolled. Telephone CPR advice was performed for bystanders of 336 (45%) patients and 304 bystanders actually performed CPR (90%). Five percent (40) of all 747 cases underwent voluntarily bystander CPR before telephone advice, 40% underwent bystander CPR according to telephone advice, and 4% (32) did not undergo CPR against telephone CPR advice. In 344 patients with bystander CPR, 33% reached ROSC, 11% survived more than 24 hours, and 3% were discharged, and in 391 patients without bystander CPR, 30%, 11%, and 6%, respectively. Restricted in 302 witnessed patients, of 125 with bystander CPR, 52% reached ROSC, 16% survived more than 24 hours, and 3% were discharged, and in 177 without bystander CPR, 44% reached ROSC, 14% survived more than 24 hours, and 1% were discharged, respectively. Conclusions Most people are willing to perform CPR. Bystanders are prepared to perform CPR with telephone CPR advice to help them. However, bystander CPR is not always adequate, resulting in no distinct eff ect of CPR on survival rate. We should educate citizens beforehand and guide bystanders with more proper and quick advice by telephone.",

Conclusions As an alternative airway device recommended by the ERC, the LT may enable airway control rapidly and eff ectively. Additionally, by using the LT, a reduced 'no-fl ow-time' and a better outcome may be possible. LT may be a good alternative airway device for providing and maintaining a patent airway during resuscitation. Introduction Besides the gold standard endotracheal tube, supraglottic airway devices are alternatives for emergency airway management [1] . The goal of the study was to identify airway devices that provide successful ventilation, even 12 months after training in manikins. Conclusions One year after training, time for successful ventilation for all devices was lower than 25 seconds. This is acceptable compared with the gold standard endotracheal tube, but due to the rising gastric infl ation rate and high amount of insuffi cient tidal volume, shorter intervals of training maybe necessary. Introduction The purpose of the study was to clarify the infl uence of aging on attitudes toward the initial three links in chains of survival. Methods We gave questionnaires to attendants of compulsory programs for basic life support (BLS) or driving technique at the beginning in authorized driving schools. The questionnaires included their backgrounds. We studied their willingness in four hypothetical scenarios related to the initial three links: early emergency call, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) under one's own initiative, telephone-assisted chest compression and use of AED. The respondents were divided into young (17 to 29 years, n = 6,122), middle-aged (29 to 59 years, n = 827), older person (>59 years, n = 15,743) groups. Results There were signifi cant diff erences in gender, occupation, residential area and experience of BLS training, and knowledge of AED use between the three groups. The proportions of respondents who are willing to perform the desirable BLS actions were lowest in the older person group (Table 1) . Multiple logistic regression analysis confi rmed that aging is one of the independent factors relating to negative attitude in all the scenarios. Gender, occupation, resident area, experience of BLS training, and knowledge for AED use were other independent factors relating to negative attitude to some of the scenarios. Conclusions The aged population is more negative to the chain of survival. More are willing to follow the telephone-assisted direction for chest compression. The BLS training should be modifi ed for them to gain confi dence and to be aware of the signifi cance and benefi t of early call. ",

Conclusions This technique could help to determine which patients should receive shock fi rst and which should receive a period of CPR prior to shock, thereby increasing the probability of survival. The potential impact of this research is high in the direction of generating a new methodology able to increase the probability of survival after a cardiac crisis. References Introduction Recent studies report an increase of asystole and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) as the fi rst monitored cardiac arrest rhythms after arrival of the Emergency Medical Services [1] . The asystolic patients presumably undergo ischaemia for a longer time and may benefi t from treatment reducing hypoxic brain injury. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has expanded into prehospital care to be initiated as soon as possible. Rapid cold crystalloid infusion is the most frequent method; however, severe haemodynamic instability is its contraindication. The aim of the study was to assess the adverse eff ects of prehospital volume expansion in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms when used in a setting with only restricted cardiovascular monitoring. Methods All patients who were deemed eligible for advance cardiac life support (ACLS) were included as long as the arrest was witnessed and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated within 20 minutes of collapse. Patients were randomized to treatment or control groups. The trial was designed to determine the safety and eff ectiveness of early cooling initiated at the site of arrest. Survival and time to target temperature were documented. Results Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD or median (interquartile range (25, 75%)). Mean age was 67.8 \u00b1 14 years in the intervention group and 65.4 \u00b1 13.9 years in the control group. On average, cooling therapy was started in 33 \u00b1 12 minutes in the RhinoChill\u2122 group and 170 \u00b1 97 minutes in the control group. Temperatures at hospital admission were signifi cant lower in the RhinoChill\u2122 group. Time to target tympanic temperature, refl ecting brain temperature, were signifi cant faster in the RhinoChill\u2122 group (211 \u00b1 124 minutes vs 424 \u00b1 217 minutes; P <0.05). Adverse events occurred in 12 patients. None was related to the cooling therapy. In the intervention group fi ve patients (20%) survived and three patients (12%) had a CPC of 1 to 2. In the control group only four patients (12.5%) survived and one patient (3.1%) had a CPC of 1 to 2. Conclusions Using the intranasal cooling method, cooling was much faster and earlier in treated patients. Neurologically intact survival and discharge rates were higher in treated patients. Transnasal cooling for the induction of therapeutic hypothermia during prehospital resuscitation is feasible and highly eff ective in lowering brain temperature rapidly. The method off ers the possibility for immediate introduction and realization of mild hypothermia in the fi eld. [1] . We sought to investigate whether a hospitalwide approach to TH after CA would reduce delays and result in improved outcomes.",

Despite the fact that therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to improve survival and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest [1] , it is underused [2] and has been only slowly introduced in many institutions. One of the reasons that it is not more widely used may be the diffi culty of implementation of a program. Methods A multidisciplinary team was assembled in 2007 to explore the opportunity for therapeutic hypothermia in patients after cardiac arrest. Pertinent literature was reviewed and a guideline and electronic orders were drafted. The team investigated all available options for cooling and chose a method that was non-invasive and did not require a large fi nancial investment by the institution. Nurses were sent to an international program to learn about hypothermia and become advocates and educators. Education was done for caregivers in the prehospital setting, emergency department, cardiac catheterization laboratory, and adult ICUs. Advertising to community and other hospitals was done by newspaper, radio, and television. The team continued to meet regularly to assess and modify the program based on experience.",

The elements that contributed to a successful program included: teamwork; multidisciplinary nature of the team; promoting awareness of the program; buy-in by nurses who championed the program in the ICU; positive patient outcomes; and low fi nancial investment for the institution. Introduction Measurement of body temperature using the tympanic method (TTM) represents a standard non-invasive method which best approximates core temperature (CTM). However, published evidence increasingly casts doubt on the agreement between TTM and CTM. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement of these two methods of temperature measurement in critically ill patients. Methods We recruited 20 consecutive critically ill patients, who required indwelling thermistor-tipped arterial catheters for haemodynamic monitoring. For each patient we simultaneously collected the core temperature, obtained from the arterial catheter, and tympanic temperatures in the left and right ears, in the supine position. Tympanic temperature was recorded using the ear setting (TTMe) and the core setting tympanic temperature (TTMc) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Genius\u2122 2; Kendall, Tyco Healthcare, MA, USA). Local ethics committee approval was waived and the study was conducted as a service improvement audit. Bland-Altman analysis was used to measure agreement between the two set of measurements.",

Comparison of the TTM in the right and left ears resulted in high variability in the recorded temperature with a percentage error of 34.4%. In view of this observed large variability, the mean TTM between the two ears was used for subsequent comparison with core temperature. Comparison of core measurements against tympanic measurements using ear settings (TTMe) showed a small positive mean bias (limits of agreement (LOA); percentage error) of 0.3\u00b0C (-0.4 to 1.1\u00b0C, 2.4%). However, when the CTM and TTM were compared using the core temperature setting of the thermometer, the bias (LOA) increased to -0.97\u00b0C (-1.6 to -0.4\u00b0C), creating a larger bias than the unadjusted TTM. Conclusions Tympanic temperature measurements showed a large random variability compared with core temperatures and suggest bilateral averaged tympanic measurements may be necessary. In our series, using the core setting increased error and increased the bias between the two methods. Our fi ndings raise the possibility that the diagnosis of fever and the need for further investigation may be aff ected by the choice of temperature measurement site and device setting used.",

In this study, we investigated whether the changes in the cerebral oxygen saturation (T-SO 2 ) obtained with the TRS and the jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO 2 ) predicted cognitive decline after cardiac surgery. Methods With institutional approval and informed consent, we studied 10 patients (68.7 \u00b1 6.1 years) undergoing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). T-SO 2 was continuously monitored using a TRS-10 (Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Hamamatsu, Japan). For measurement of SjvO 2 , a 5.5 Fr oximetry catheter was inserted by retrograde cannulation of the right internal jugular vein. The values of T-SO 2 and SjvO 2 were compared with each point: before CPB, 5 minutes after the onset of CPB, before aorta clamp, after aorta clamp, rewarming, aorta declamp, end of rewarming, and end of CPB. The cognitive decline was evaluated by Mini Mental State Examination before and 7 days after the operation. The statistical analysis was performed by repeated-measures ANOVA followed by Fisher's PLSD. P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant. Results Four of 10 cases showed postoperative cognitive decline. The mean values of T-SO 2 and SjvO 2 during operation in patients without postoperative cognitive decline (n = 6) were 63.9 \u00b1 4.6% and 60.5 \u00b1 9.7%, respectively, and there were no statistical signifi cances between these values.

Moreover it aimed to verify whether this kind of monitoring aff ects the incidence of postoperative neurological defi cits. Methods We monitored 50 patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm clipping with the use of Somanetics INVOS Cerebral Oximeter 4100. The alarm threshold of rSO 2 was defi ned as a minimum of 20% drop from baseline, triggering intervention aimed at increasing rSO 2 values. Results Eleven cases of postoperative deterioration of neurological status were noted, of which six were reversible. Additional intraoperative events, such as numerous surgical clip displacements, temporary clipping, aneurysm ruptures, and trapping occurred in 16 cases. On the operated side, a rapid, lasting increase of rSO 2 values was noted in nearly one-half of the cases; implying an artifact caused by the neurosurgical procedure. On the nonoperated side, seven cases of rSO 2 values dipping below the alarm threshold were noted. In all cases intervention led to an increase and normalization of rSO 2 values in a relatively short time. Since the values registered in the frontal lobe on the nonoperated side were considered representative of the entire brain, the balance of cerebral oxygen supply and consumption was seen as intraoperatively preserved. The comparison between two groups of patients, with and without neurological defi cits developed in the postoperative period, revealed no disparities in cerebral oximetry values on the nonoperated side, nor in the range of other monitored physiological parameters. In 10 out of 16 cases involving additional intraoperative events, deterioration of neurological status was noted (62.5%), while in the remaining cases only one such occurrence was registered (2.95%). Conclusions Monitoring regional brain oxygen saturation on the operated side is a method hampered by a large percentage of false results, and thus is a monitoring tool of little prognostic value. Assuming that the frontal lobe on the nonoperated side is representative of the entire brain with regard to rSO 2 measures, the maintenance of oxygen supply and demand balance does not safeguard the brain against ischemic lesions in the supply area of the operated artery. stiff ness was assessed by sonographic measurements of the carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV).

It collects data from a variety of bedside monitors and produces time trends of parameters defi ned using confi gurable mathematical formulae. To date it is being used in nearly 40 clinical research centres worldwide. We present its application for continuous monitoring of cerebral autoregulation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methods Data from multiple bedside monitors are processed by ICM + in real time using a large selection of signal processing methods. These include various time and frequency domain analysis functions as well as fully customisable digital fi lters. The fi nal results are displayed in a variety of ways including simple time trends, as well as time window based histograms, cross histograms, correlations, and so forth. All this allows complex information from bedside monitors to be summarized in a concise fashion and presented to medical and nursing staff in a simple way that alerts them to the development of various pathological processes. Conclusions ICM + software is proving to be a very useful tool for enhancing the battery of available means for monitoring cerebral vasoreactivity and potentially facilitating autoregulation guided therapy. Complexity of data analysis is also hidden inside loadable profi les, thus allowing investigators to take full advantage of validated protocols including advanced processing formulas. dysbalances and their relationship to outcome in the neurologicneurosurgical care unit (NNICU) over a period of 5 years.

We compared the incidence of cerebral complications, Glasgow Outcome Scale upon discharge from the NNICU and mortality in the NNICU between these two groups.",

Results showed that some components of the TEG failed to identify hypercoagulation (r <0.2, P >0.75). All components of the HVG test refl ect postoperative coagulopathies. Conclusions Hypercoagulability is not refl ected completely by standard coagulation monitoring and TEG, and seems to be predominantly caused by increased platelet reactivity.

Incidence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 x 10 9 /l) was 29.8% on admission to the ICU, increasing to 46.9% when considering the entire ICU stay. Comparing survivors and nonsurvivors, nonsurvivors had a lower trough platelet count (140 x 10 9 /l vs 181 x 10 9 /l, P = 0.005). Patients with platelet counts less than 50 x 10 9 /l have the highest mortality (45.7% vs 27.6%, P = 0.006). Platelet data were used to construct an ROC curve, demonstrating an area under the curve of 0.66, P <0.001. Platelet count correlated negatively with APACHE II (r = -0.20, P <0.001) but did not correlate signifi cantly with length of stay or duration of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions Thrombocytopenia occurs in 47% of our ICU patients. It correlates signifi cantly with severity of illness as measured by APACHE II and decreasing platelet count correlates with increasing mortality, with the highest mortality in those with a trough ICU platelet count of less than 50 x 10 9 /l. The ROC characteristics also demonstrate that the platelet count is a useful predictor of mortality. Introduction Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a lifethreatening and limb-threatening, immune-mediated, prothrombotic disease resulting from an interaction between heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4). Due to the many causes of thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients, the diagnosis of HIT is diffi cult, requiring both a high clinical suspicion and confi rmatory testing. The ELISA test is the most commonly performed method to detect anti-PF4 antibodies; however, the ELISA results generally take one or more days to report. The particle immunofi ltration assay (PIFA) test has the advantage of being done rapidly; with results generally available within 1 hour.",

Exclusion criteria: haematological malignancy, platelet count <50,000/mm 3 before anticoagulant treatment. After anticoagulant administration start, patients showing a fall of platelet count >50% or a nadir <150,000/mm 3 were clinically evaluated with the 4T score (4Ts) [1] : cases with a 4Ts of at least 2 were investigated with the laboratory antigen assay, the ELISA.

References Introduction Many procedures in cardiac surgery require extracorporeal circulation (EC). During EC, blood is pumped from a venous line to an oxygenator, cooled and infused back via an arterial line. This procedure is known to compromise the coagulation system, especially under prolonged hypothermia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the eff ects of EC and hypothermia on the coagulation system in a porcine model. The effi cacy of a substitution therapy with a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) regarding normalization of coagulation and decrease in hemorrhage was evaluated. Methods A total of 17 male anesthetized pigs were included in the study. EC was performed in 12 animals by a hollowfi ber oxygenator with a priming solution containing saline, HES and heparin. Five animals without EC served as a control. The coagulation system was characterized by thromboelastography (TEG), thrombin generation, coagulation factor levels, platelet numbers and function (aggregation). A GoreTex patch was inserted into the carotid artery, bleeding occurred from the stitch channels. The eff ects of intravenous substitution therapy by PCC (Beriplex P/N, 30 U/kg, n = 6) compared with placebo (n = 6) on bleeding from the stitch channels was investigated.",

Using multiple linear regressions, all coagulation, TEG and HVG variables were used to model postoperative hypercoagulation. However, three components of the routine coagulation assay, including bleeding time, prothrombin time and platelet count, could be modeled to show prolonged postoperative hypercoagulability (P <0.01).

References Introduction Uncontrolled haemorrhage is a leading cause of early mortality in trauma. Administration of blood products, packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma (PRBC:FFP) in the ratio of 1:1 is associated with improved mortality in major haemorrhage in adult trauma. However, there is little evidence available for the management of major haemorrhage in the context of paediatric trauma. Methods We retrospectively analysed the local paediatric trauma database of all children following trauma call activation on arrival at the emergency department of The Royal London Hospital, a major urban trauma centre in London. The study period was over 15 months, May 2008 to August 2009. During this period, there has been no major haemorrhage policy within the centre for paediatric trauma. We collected data on demographic profi le, injury severity scores, blood products transfused in the fi rst 24 hours and the outcomes. We defi ned massive transfusion as the requirement of packed red cells >40 ml/kg in the fi rst 4 hours or >80 ml/kg in the fi rst 24 hours.",

            "text": "Results Two hundred and twenty-seven children presented to the emergency department during this period following major trauma call activation. The median age at presentation was 10.2 years. Thirteen (5.7%) children had major haemorrhage. The median ISS was 35 (IQR 10 to 60). All but one were males. Three had penetrating trauma, one of whom made it to theatre, but all died. Four had emergency damage control surgery. Abnormal results were seen in three patients, each having one abnormal result (INR =1.9 and APTT = 86, low Hb = 7.6, thrombocytopaenia = 63). Eight of the 13 patients received additional blood products such as fresh frozen plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate. However, no patient received the ratio of blood products of PRBC:FFP of 1:1 as practised in adult trauma. Two patients had no admission bloods done. Worsening coagulation parameters were seen in two patients when measured post transfusion and the remaining 11 patients did not have routine monitoring of blood parameters post transfusion. Eight (62%) patients died, of which seven died in the emergency department. Conclusions Major haemorrhage is associated with a very high mortality in severely injured children. We recommend rigorous monitoring of laboratory parameters to guide appropriate administration of blood products. There is a need for instituting a major haemorrhage policy in paediatric trauma and consideration of point-of-care testing of blood parameters. Methods Twenty-one pigs were anesthetized, instrumented and randomized into three groups: Control, HES and GEL. Animals in the HES and GEL groups were submitted to acute isovolemic anemia to a target hematocrit of 15% with volume replacement performed with HES 130/0.4 and GEL at a 1:1 ratio. The withdrawn blood was returned to the animals 120 minutes after the end of AIA.

Introduction Community-acquired sepsis at an early stage is common, but haemodynamic alterations remain unclear. The aim of the study was to characterize cardiovascular alterations in patients of our ProFS (monocentric observational) study, which was to characterize patients with sepsis in the emergency department. Methods Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO) were measured non-invasively using a TaskForce monitor (CNSystems, Graz, Austria) after admission, 24 hours and 72 hours. Indexed values were calculated (SVRI (dyn\u00b7second/cm 5 /m 2 ), CI (l/minute/m 2 )). Procalcitonin (PCT, ng/ml) was measured in serum. Results A sample of 64 patients of 208 included patients received haemodynamic examination. Mean age was 61.8 \u00b1 18.0 years, 62.7% were male. Patients were divided by PCT <2 and \u22652. Age, gender and previous medical history were comparable in both groups. The heart rate was 99.8 \u00b1 21.6 vs 104.6 \u00b1 23.0/minute (P = NS) and the mean artery pressure was 89.5 \u00b1 15.6 vs 81.6 \u00b1 21.5 mmHg (P <0.01). Mean SVRI in patients with PCT <2 was 2,934 \u00b1 1,045 vs 2,376 \u00b1 842, P <0.05 at the time of admission. No diff erence was found after 24 hours (2,959 \u00b1 1,002 vs 2,924 \u00b1 1,324, P = NS) and 72 hours (3,123 \u00b1 931 vs 3,556 \u00b1 1,524, P = NS). On the contrary, for patients with PCT \u22652 the increase after 72 hours was signifi cant (P <0.05). Diff erences after admission could not be observed for CI between patients with PCT <2 vs \u22652. Mean values after admission were 2.7 \u00b1 1.0 vs 2.8 \u00b1 0.8, after 24 hours 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 vs 2.5 \u00b1 0.5, and after 72 hours 2.3 \u00b1 0.7 vs 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 (all: P = NS). See Figure 1 Conclusions Patients with community-acquired sepsis in the emergency department had an elevated SVRI. At the time of admission patients with high PCT had a signifi cantly lower SVRI than patients with low PCT. Cardiac index at the time of admission was at a lower limit of normal range in all patients. These fi ndings are in strong contrast to the classic pattern of sepsis on the ICU, where SVRI is keenly reduced and CI elevated. They implicate that patients with sepsis in the emergency department may benefi t more from application of fl uid and positive inotrope substances than from vasopressor. Introduction A multicentre, prospective, observational study conducted in four intensive therapy units (ITUs) in India from June 2006 to June 2009 to determine the incidence and outcome of severe sepsis among adult patients. Methods All patients admitted to the ITU were screened daily for SIRS, organ dysfunction and severe sepsis as defi ned by the ACCP and SCCM. Patient with severe sepsis were further studied. Results A total of 5,478 ITU admissions were studied. SIRS with organ dysfunction was found in 1,385 (25%) patients, of which 731 (52.77%) were due to sepsis. The incidence of severe sepsis was 16.45% of all admissions. Mean age of the study population was 58.17 years (SD 18.66), of which 57.71% were male. The median APACHE II score was 13 (IQR 13 to 14) with predominant (90.93%) medical admission. ITU mortality of all admissions was 12.08% and that of severe sepsis was 59.26%. Hospital mortality and 28-day mortality of severe sepsis were 65.2% and 64.6%, respectively. The standardized mortality ratio of severe sepsis patients was 1.45. Median duration of stay in the ITU for the severe sepsis cohort who survived was 13 days (IQR 11 to 17). The number of episodes where infection was the primary reason for admission to the ITU was 86.32%. Culture positivity was found in 61.6%. The lung was the predominant source of sepsis (57.45%). Gram-negative organisms were responsible for 72.45% of cases and Grampositive for 13.13%. The rest were parasitic, viral and fungal infection.",

A 7% absolute reduction (relative reduction of 11.6%) in hospital mortality was found in the third semester of the campaign (OR 1.33 (1.04 to 1.69), P = 0.01). However, in the fourth semester mortality has increased again to 60.6%.",

In each patient the compliance to four resuscitation interventions recommended by the SSC guidelines (that is, 6-hour bundle) and the 30-day mortality were measured.

In these patients the MELD and SOFA scores (39 \u00b1 11 and 18 \u00b1 2) were higher (P <0.05) than those observed in patients without compliance to the 6-hour bundle (31 \u00b1 12 and vs 15 \u00b1 3). The 30-day mortality was 94.7% and 68.4% (P <0.05) in patients with and without 6-hour bundle compliance, respectively.

Recently, there has been further interest in the complications of DAA following a review by Gentry and colleagues suggesting a signifi cantly increased incidence of SBEs and death in those with baseline bleeding precautions [1] . We are one of the largest single-centre users of DAA worldwide and thus are keen to report our experience. Methods In 2002 a scoring system, reporting tool, and supporting database were developed to track the outcome of DAA-treated severe sepsis patients in our hospital. This is maintained by the clinical pharmacists and captures data on relative contraindications, adverse events and patient outcome. Classifi cation of data is obtained from the electronic patient record. Any DAA administration outside agreed criteria is recorded and bleeding incidents are reviewed with a consultant intensivist to confi rm categorisation into serious or minor. Conclusions Our results are similar to those of a UK-wide audit of APC usage [1] . The mortality of our patients was higher (56% vs 45%), but our patients were probably sicker (median fi ve organ failures vs three).

After the investigation of some cytokine levels we obtained similar results: IL-6, TNF\u03b2 and IL-8 levels had been reduced 30 to 40%, 87% and 62 to 76% accordingly. At the same time, IL-2, INF\u03b3, IL-12, TNF\u03b1, IL-4 and IL-5 levels in serum had not changed practically. However, in approximately 1/3 cases an IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 concentration increase in serum was observed (33 and 40% accordingly). Also our research has shown that, in the most of the cases after application of this sorbent, LBP decreased insignifi cantly (10 to 32%), but the sIL-1 RII level slightly increased (10 to 18%) in the majority of patients and considerably decreased (two times) in 1/3 investigated patients.

Introduction It was assumed that pathologic activation of neutrophils and monocytes is associated with sepsis, acute lung injury/ARDS, and multiple organ failure, and that removal of these cells from the circulation could reduce leukocyte-dependent tissue injury. Cartridges containing polymyxin B (PMX) immobilized to fi bers (Toraymyxin; Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan) have been developed for selective adsorption of circulating endotoxin in patients with Gram-negative bacterial infection, and this treatment has proven to be highly eff ective. This study examined the eff ect of direct hemoperfusion through fi lters with immobilized PMX direct-hemoperfusion (DHP) on leukocyte function and plasma levels of cytokines in patients with septic shock. Methods We evaluated the eff ect of PMX-DHP on circulating leukocytes in patients with septic shock by assessing the changes of neutrophil and monocyte surface antigen expression after PMX-DHP. In another experiment, heparinized blood from patients with sepsis was passed through PMX fi lters in a laboratory circuit and then changes of the cell count and surface antigen expression by neutrophils and monocytes were assessed. After perfusion, neutrophils were isolated and the capacity of these cells to damage cultured endothelial monolayers was also determined.",

Plasma levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and high-mobility group box-1, were elevated in patients with septic shock compared with healthy controls, but cytokine levels were not altered by PMX-DHP. Ex vivo perfusion of heparinized blood from patients with sepsis through PMX fi lters in a laboratory circuit caused a signifi cant decrease of the neutrophil and monocyte counts. Activated neutrophils with high CD11b/CD64 expression and low CXCR1/CXCR2 expression showed preferential adhesion to PMX fi lters. Neutrophils isolated from the blood after ex vivo PMX perfusion caused less damage on the endothelial cell monolayer than cells from sham-treated blood. Introduction Direct and rapid removal of pathogens or noxious metabolites from a patient is the most straightforward cure imaginable. Dialysis and plasma fi ltration/exchange are the current broadly applicable methods to perform a direct removal of disease-causing factors from a patient. We describe the use of stable nanomagnets to rapidly and selectively remove heavy metal ions, overdosed steroid drugs and proteins from human blood. This nanomagnet-based purifi cation method avoids fouling of fi lter membranes and benefi ts from a high external surface area, and a correspondingly fast diff usion. Methods Nanomagnets equipped with heavy metal complexants, digoxin antibody fragments and entire human IL-6 antibodies were added to a series of blood samples. The nanomagnets scan blood by Brownian motion and capture their target. Afterwards, a small magnet was placed at the sample tube wall accumulating the nanomagnets in the pole region of the external magnet. The purifi ed supernatant can then easily be decanted. The concentrations of lead, digoxin and IL-6 in blood samples were determined by standard clinical methods. Blood integrity was observed by rotation thromboelastography and monitoring of serum potassium, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin and haptoglobin levels. To measure the biological relevance of the IL-6 removal, the eff ect on caspase-3 activation was assessed in camptothecin-stimulated neutrophils.",

On the other hand, the current study also suggests that ICU admission and RRT should be considered in selected patients. Mortality in these patients is mostly dependent on the severity of acute illness and the performance status, rather than cancerrelated characteristics. Conclusions These results suggest signifi cant increased ICU mortality in the following groups: over 50 years old, smokers, patients with poor exercise tolerance, patients with IHD or PV, patients with COPD and patients who drink alcohol to excess or those with ALD. While these results should not be used as a basis upon which to permit or refuse intensive care admission, they should be used to inform staff and patients of likely outcome from intensive care. Introduction C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein, the blood levels of which increase rapidly in response to infection, trauma, ischemia, burns, and other infl ammatory conditions. Serum albumin decreases in critically ill patients with similar conditions. The use of these blood tests as risk markers or as predictors of organ failure and death has been studied previously [1, 2] and we wished to investigate their applicability to our population. Admission CRP correlated positively with length of stay (r = 0.14, P = 0.017) and APACHE II score (r = 0.13, P = 0.03) but did not signifi cantly correlate with duration of mechanical ventilation (r = 0.10, P = 0.103).

By 12 months, the mean score for the PICU group on the physical functioning subscale had improved signifi cantly (from 73.1 to 81.5, P <0.001) but was still below normal population levels (healthy mean = 88.5, P <0.01). The total PedsQL score at 12 months was not associated with PIM score or length of stay, but was signifi cantly negatively associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (r = -0.40, P <0.001). Within-group analyses revealed that electively admitted children reported higher emotional functioning than healthy children at 3 months (PICU elective mean = 91.0 vs healthy mean = 78.5, P <0.01).",

Methods ICU beds are classifi ed by levels of care deliverable as High (ventilator, monitor, and 720 minutes nurse time) and Low (monitor and 360 minutes nurse time) [1] . The level of care actually delivered is classifi ed as High (invasive or non-invasive ventilation, or two vasoactive drugs, or at least two of the following: one vasoactive drug, dialysis, respiratory support), Low (single vasoactive drug, or dialysis, or respiratory support) and Ordinary (none of the above) [2] . Mismatches between the level of beds available and the level of care delivered were evaluated both on admission and for each ICU-day of 4,237 patients in 28 ICUs. An ICU-day was judged as inappropriate, even without mismatch, if an Ordinary patient was present. [1] . Patients in critical care typically receive highrisk medications. Error reporting is integral to identifying common errors and medication risk reduction. Methods A medication reporting form was developed to run alongside the offi cial hospital incident reporting system for 2 weeks. Forms were distributed throughout the critical care facility.

Four ATC codes accounted for 80% of both quantities and costs, with ATC code B (blood and haematopoietic organs) amounting to 63% in quantities and 41% in costs, followed by ATC code J (systemic anti-infective, 20% of the costs), ATC code N (nervous system, 11% of the costs) and ATC code C (cardiovascular system, 8% of the costs). Prescription by SC amounted to 1% in drug quantities, but 19% in drug costs. The rate of increase in quantities and costs was seven times larger for ICP than for SC (Figure 1 overleaf ). Some peak values in costs and quantities were related to a very limited number of patients. Conclusions A 5-year increase in quantities and costs of drug prescription in an ICU is a matter of concern. Rather unexpectedly, total costs and cost increases were generated mainly by ICP. A careful follow-up is necessary to try infl uencing this evolution through an institutional policy co-opted by all professional categories involved in the process. Introduction One consequence of pressure on inpatient hospital bed numbers is a delay in the discharge of critically ill patients to the ward.

Thoracic epidural block (TEB), central \u03b1 2 -receptor stimulation via intravenous clonidine application and stimulation of opioid receptors can decrease either pain and/or stress and might therefore infl uence this immune imbalance. The primary endpoint of the current study was the perioperative Th1/Th2 balance in lung surgery. The secondary endpoints aimed to the incidence of pain and pneumonia. Methods After approval by the ethics committee and informed consent a total of 60 patients was randomized to receive double-blinded either remifentanil intravenously, or remifentanil + clonidine intravenously, or ropivacaine epidurally. Pain intensity was assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS). The Th1/Th2 ratio was measured using a cytometric bead array.

Introduction Methyl-naltrexone (Relistor\u00ae), a peripheral \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist shown to induce laxation in patients receiving opioids, is licenced for use in palliative care; a similar benefi t is proposed in critical care patients. Impaired gut motility and constipation are common issues in the critical care setting with contributing factors including trauma, surgery and use of opiate analgesics. The eff ects of methyl-naltrexone were studied on seven patients in whom conventional treatment for constipation with stimulant and osmotic laxatives, faecal softeners and suppositories failed to produce eff ects. Methods Over a 6-week period, 15 critically ill patients with opiateinduced constipation (OIC) of more than 4 days duration were pros pectively studied. All patients were treated with conventional methods from admission to critical care, which included regular senna and sodium docusate, supplemented with glycerin suppositories and picolax for resistant constipation. Methyl-naltrexone was administered to seven patients at 0.15 \u03bcg/kg subcutaneously on alternate days until laxation occurred. The remainder of patients in the study continued with conventional therapy. Results Six out of seven patients responded to methyl-naltrexone with laxation occurring between 12 and 24 hours. One patient did not respond due to faecal impaction but subsequently experienced laxation after manual disimpaction. Side eff ects were few (nausea 14%, vomiting 14%) and there was no increase in opiate requirement. Those patients treated by conventional means eventually produced laxation after a further 3 to 5 days.",

Further evidence suggests that some sedatives and analgesics are more prone to cause oversedation than others, possibly due to disturbances in pharmacokinetic properties in the context of acute organ failure.

These steps included question development and questionnaire formatting and testing before being published on the Zoomerang\u2122 website.

Methods Consecutive patients admitted to a medical-surgical ICU during 1 year were included when alert (RASS >-2) and able to follow simple commands. Exclusion criteria: previous self-report pain assessment without the presence of an investigator. Pain assessment using the fi ve scales in random order either at baseline (T1) and after (T2) administration of an analgesic, or during a nociceptive procedure, in absence of pain at baseline. Evaluated parameters: psychometric properties of scales (feasibility, validity, responsiveness and preference). Nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis (Statview 5.0). Data are expressed as median (25th to 75th). Results All basal levels were below the expected values. Following enteral administration, pharmacological levels were already reached in 5 minutes, with a serum peak after 16 minutes (half-absorption time: 3 minutes 17 seconds). The maximum serum level observed was 11,040 pg/ml and the disappearance rate indicated a half-elimination time of 1 hour 34 minutes. Serum melatonin levels decreased signifi cantly after midnight; pharmacological levels were maintained up to 10 hours following administration. No excessive sleepiness was reported in this patient group. Conclusions Critically ill patients exhibited reduced melatonin secretion, as reported in the literature. Despite the critical illness, the oral bioavailability was satisfactory: serum levels after oral administration showed basically unchanged intestinal absorption, while the disappearance rate was slower than reported elsewhere in healthy volunteers. Introduction The aim of our study is to describe clinical progress, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), complications and mortality of patients with delirium tremens (DT) admitted to our ICU. Methods Patients with a diagnosis of DT admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary hospital from January 2001 to December 2008 were included. We recorded: admission diagnosis, pathologies associated with DT, APACHE II score, treatment, need for MV and duration, complications, length of stay in the ICU and total hospital stay, mortality and survival at 2 years. Results There were 50 cases of DT. Median age 45 years, 96% male. Reasons for hospital admission: DT (68%), seizures (36%), sepsis (16%), brain injury (10%). Reasons for admission to the ICU: DT (54%), DT and seizures (26%), DT and brain injury (10%), DT and sepsis (8%), DT and other (2%). Median APACHE II score was 9 (range: 8 to 13). Seventy-four percent of the patients were controlled with no need for MV with a midazolam infusion of 45 to 50 \u03bcg/kg/hour and haloperidol of 17 to 30 \u03bcg/kg/hour. Twenty-eight per cent (14 patients) required MV, of them 78% had DT and other associated pathology on admission (Figure 1 ). From a total of 28 patients admitted with DT and no associated pathology, only four needed MV. The median time on MV was 2 days (range: 1 to 9). Complications were present in 22%: ventilation-associated pneumonia, and other infectious conditions. Total hospital length of stay 14 days ((SD: 11), 5.5 days in the ICU (SD: 9). The registered hospital mortality was 4%. Rate of survival at 2 years was 84%, from these 72% had continuous visits to emergency (\u22655 consultations in 2 years) for episodes related to alcohol withdrawal or complications associated with chronic alcohol abuse.",

These patients are regular users of the health system. The occurrence of complications and the need for MV in our patients were low, and were present in the group of DT with other diagnoses. Introduction Delirium in ICU patients increases time on mechanical venti lation, is an independent risk factor for death and can cause cognitive impairment in survivors [1, 2] . The two most commonly used validated assessment methods for diagnosing delirium in intensive care are the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM) and the Intensive Care Delirium Checklist Score (ISDCS) [3] . We wished to determine the prevalence of delirium in our unit, whether there was a diff erence in results between these methods of assessment and whether good agreement could be achieved between two trained assessors. Methods We performed a prospective prevalence study in a single tertiary ICU. Patients were assessed between days 3 and 10 of their stay and tested provided their Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) was \u2265-3 [1] . Each patient was independently assessed by the two trained assessors with the CAM and ISDCS, with randomisation of both the order of interview and the score used. Both sets of assessments were carried out within an hour of each other. Exclusions included readmissions, those who did not speak English, the deaf and registered psychiatric patients. The CAM was completed by the assessors and the ISDCS required observational answers from the bedside nurse.",

Introduction Both inhaled hydrogen sulfi de (H 2 S) [1] and intravenous H 2 S donors protected against kidney ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [2] [3] [4] , but all these data originate from unresuscitated rodent models. Therefore, we investigated the eff ect of the H 2 S donor Na 2 S in a clinically relevant porcine model of aortic occlusion-induced renal I/R injury. Methods Anesthetised and ventilated pigs received Na 2 S (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 10) for 2 hours before and 8 hours after 90 minutes of intra-aortic balloon occlusion-induced kidney ischemia. During reperfusion noradrenaline was titrated to keep blood pressure at baseline levels. Before Na 2 S, prior to aortic occlusion and at 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours of reperfusion, we measured renal blood fl ow and function (creatinine clearance and blood levels, fractional Na + excretion), blood cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) and nitrates, renal tissue DNA damage (comet assay), HO-1 and caspase-3 expression (western blotting), and NF-\u03baB activation (EMSA). Histological damage (glomerular tubularisation [5] ) was assessed immediately post mortem. Results Na 2 S pretreatment was associated with a progressive fall in core temperature and signifi cantly lower noradrenaline infusion rates needed to achieve the hemodynamic targets. While renal blood fl ow and fractional Na + excretion were comparable, Na 2 S attenuated the fall in creatinine clearance and the rise in creatinine blood levels, respectively, which coincided with signifi cantly lower IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and nitrate blood levels. Kidney glomerular and tissue DNA damage were markedly attenuated, whereas NF-\u03baB activation was signifi cantly higher in the Na 2 S-treated animals.",

We describe a method to purify 1-OHMG from UFR. Methods Ethics approval was granted. To purify, UFR was extracted on a C-18 column, it was washed and eluted. HPLC-MS separation was performed. The 1-OHMG (mol. wt 517/ 518 in MS) was desiccated and re-dissolved four times to maximise purity. Electrospray (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) characterised 1-OHMG. The purity was calculated using NMR. A calibration plot of 1-OHMG, MDZ and DZP (internal standard) for HPLC-MS was performed. Results 1-OHMG identity was confi rmed using MS/MS (Figure 1 ). Two milligrams of 1-OHMG was purifi ed from 5,000 ml UFR. The 1-OHMG was 98% pure (NMR). The extinction coeffi cient was identical to MDZ. The calibration plot resulted in correlation of 0.912.

The key drug for the treatment of VOD is defi brotide and the patients were severely thrombocytopenic, we have not used any anticoagulation in the CVVH set. The dose of defi brotide ranged from 10 to 20 mg/kg/day according to the severity of thrombocytopenia and eventually hemorrhagic symptoms. Blood count, acid-base balance and biochemistry were monitored at least twice daily. The thrombocytopenia was corrected with the donor platelets and the platelet level was sustained at 20 x 10 9 l.",

A new group, Acute Liver Failure studies in Europe (ALSiE), has and wishes to further initiate collaboration between centres with clinical expertise in the management of ALF. It aims to establish a pan-European database of clinical and demographic data in ALF and initiate clinical studies. Methods We describe the experience of 13 centres in seven countries over a 3-month period to 31 March 2009. ALF was defi ned as an INR >1.5 and encephalopathy in the absence of chronic liver disease. Results are presented as median and IQ range. Results Eighty-fi ve patients were treated, acetaminophen was the dominant aetiology in the UK, 60%, and represented 34% in other centres. At presentation INR was 3.8 (2.1 to 6.5), hepatic encephalopathy (HE) grade I (0 to 2) was observed and 20% required pressors. Grade III/IV coma was seen in 64% during their course and of these 25% developed ICH. Seventyone per cent required ventilation, 58% renal replacement therapy and pressors in 65%. Ninety per cent required management in a critical care environment. Overall survival was 75% -42 cases fulfi lled poor prognostic criteria (PPC), of whom 31 were transplanted, 28 (90%) surviving to hospital discharge. Of the 11 remaining, four survived and seven died. Thirty-two out of 43 who did not fulfi ll PPC survived. Patients who died were older and had a predominant aetiology of hypoxic hepatitis. One organ support or less was associated with 70% survival with medical management alone. Two organ support or more was required in 55 patients and 27% survived with medical management, the remainder requiring transplantation or died.",

The development of ICH is 25% in grade III/IV HE. Despite this, outcomes are good. Introduction Following liver transplantation, hepatic artery stenosis and portal vein obstruction occur in 3 to 12% of the patients, and more frequently in children than adults. Today, the standard of care is Doppler ultrasound and liver enzyme assessment daily. Accordingly, detection of severe hypoperfusion may be delayed. The aim of the present study was to explore whether microdialysis catheters implanted in the left and right liver lobe, by measurement of glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glycerol every 2 hours, detected vascular complications and rejection. Methods Seventy-three patients undergoing 82 liver transplantations were included. Nine of the patients were children. Two microdialysis catheters were inserted in the liver and one in subcutaneous tissue by a split needle technique. They were kept for as long as the catheters functioned, and maximally 4 weeks. Metabolic parameters (glucose, pyruvate, glycerol and lactate) were collected every 2 hours and measured bedside. Results Median age of the patients was 52 years (6 months to 70 years). The median time for catheters inserted in the liver was 9.5 days, with a range from 0.5 to 26 days. Six patients had hepatic artery stenosis/ occlusion, and in fi ve of them lactate increased to values >10 mM with a lactate/pyruvate ratio of several hundred and a concomitant decrease in glucose and increase in glycerol. In one patient (a 6-month-old child) lactate only increased to 2 mM and the LP ratio to 20. On the background of pathological metabolic values, all patients underwent immediate reoperation and blood clots were removed and the artery reanastomosed.",

            "text": "In the child with low lactate values, the fl ow of the artery was less than 10% of total hepatic blood fl ow, despite reanastomosis. Thus, the exceptionally high portal fl ow delivered enough oxygen to prevent major ischemia despite very low fl ow in the artery. Thirteen patients had rejection verifi ed by biopsy, and in six patients anti-rejection therapy was given based on liver function tests and clinical judgement. All patients had some increase in lactate during the period of rejection, but the increase was in all but four patients only 1 mM. In the remaining four the increase was 3 to 4 mM. Conclusions By using microdialysis catheters measuring metabolic parameters, hepatic artery occlusions can be detected very rapidly. Patients with rejection show a small, but signifi cant, increase in lactate. Introduction Liver dysfunction in critically ill patients represents a major concern. Many drugs used in the ICU have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity presents in three distinct patterns: cholestatic (alkaline phosphatase (AP) \u22652 x ULN and ratio (ALT/ULN)/(AP/ ULN) \u22642), hepatocellular (ALT \u22653 x ULN and ratio \u22655) and mixed (AP \u22652 x ULN, ALT \u22653 x ULN and ratio between 2 and 5). No published studies have assessed the drug-induced cholestastic pattern of hepatotoxicity in the ICU. The aim of this study was to assess whether use of pharmacological classes previously associated with cholestasis are associated with an increased risk of pure or mixed cholestasis in the ICU. Methods A nested case-control study assessed the potential association between use of specifi ed pharmacological classes and cholestasis. Cases were identifi ed from a cohort of patients admitted \u226524 hours in whom at least one value of AP <240 IU/l had been obtained in the 72 hours following admission. We excluded patients with an identifi ed cause of cholestasis as well as patients with bone metastasis and pregnant women. Each case the subject was matched to a control subject based on age, gender, and length of ICU stay and admission year. Exposure to antiepileptics, penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, macrolid antibiotics and parenteral nutrition was collected and included in a multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis with known risk factors. Introduction Energy requirements of critically ill septic shock patients treated in the ICU are particularly diffi cult to determine. Recent research shows that energy expenditure (EE) in those patients may be smaller than it was previously believed. EE values in this group are aff ected by the severity of the disease process as well as by administered treatment (sedation, inactivity of skeletal and respiratory muscles, fi ghting fever). The purpose of this study was to establish the infl uence of septic shock on EE in sedated and mechanically ventilated patients treated in the ICU. Using indirect calorimetry, we assessed EE in those patients and compared results with basal energy expenditure calculated according to the Harris-Benedict equation (BEE), and with EE values in patients subjected to general anesthesia. Methods Two groups of patients were studied with regard to EE measured by means of indirect calorimetry. Group I consisted of 50 critically ill patients treated in the ICU for septic shock. They were evaluated using the APACHE II and SOFA scores, taking into account the 28-day mortality. EE was measured continuously over the fi rst 24 hours of treatment by means of the Datex-Ohmeda M-COVX indirect calorimeter. Group II comprised 50 patients (ASA I and II), whose energy expenditure was measured under general anesthesia in surgical treatment of disc herniation. Energy expenditure measurements were taken with the use of the Datex-Ohmeda E-CAiOVX indirect calorimeter, adapted to work in an atmosphere containing anesthetic gases. Conclusions A decrease in the total metabolic rate of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock can constitute a prognostic indicator of heightened death risk in this group of ICU-treated patients. were excluded from the study. Onset time and occurrence of pneumonia were extracted from the hospital's database; patients who died during the fi rst 48 hours were then excluded.

Accumulations of these cytokines in animal models have been observed in remote organs, however data are lacking regarding early serial heart cytokine levels following burn injury, and the therapeutic eff ects of estrogen on these levels. Using an animal model, we studied the acute eff ects of a fullthickness third-degree burn on cardiac levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF\u03b1. In addition, we analyzed the eff ect of estrogen on levels of cytochrome C, signifying apoptosis, and levels of NF-\u03baB, signifying infl ammation. Here, we hypothesized that acute estrogen treatment decreases infl ammation in the heart and blocks the induction of apoptosis. Methods In this study, 144 male rats received third-degree 40% total body surface area burns. Fifteen minutes following burn injury, the animals received a subcutaneous injection of either placebo or 17\u03b2-estradiol (0.5 mg/kg). The hearts were harvested at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours after injury, and the heart cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF\u03b1) levels were measured using the ELISA method.

In addition, we determined that estradiol treatment restored cytosolic levels of NF-\u03baB (65% increase) at the 24-hour time point. Also, estrogen decreased cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome C (50% reduction) at the 24-hour time point. Conclusions Following severe burn injury, estrogens decrease cardiac infl ammation and levels of the pro-apoptotic cytochrome C. In addition, estrogen signaling promotes cell survival, as indicated by an increase in NF-\u03baB levels. Importantly, estrogen treatment following burn injury nearly ablated the deleterious burn-induced increase of TNF\u03b1 in the heart to levels similar to unburned control animals. Elevated cardiac levels of TNF\u03b1 have previously been linked to a poor outcome. Introduction Glucocorticoids are known to have an anti-insulin action on glucose metabolism, leading to increased lactate production [1] . Alternatively, glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is a well-recognized phenomenon initiated by mitochondrial dysfunction [2] . Increased lactate production follows loss of mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis. Both mechanisms may lead to clinically relevant hyperlactatemia following glucocorticoid administration during cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods All adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass from 5 October through 21 November 2005 in a large academic teaching hospital in Rotterdam, the Netherlands were included in this study. Dexamethasone (60 to 80 mg) was given perioperatively at the discretion of the anesthetist. Lactate levels were measured within 1 hour postoperatively. The association between dexamethasone treatment, serum lactate levels and possible confounders was evaluated using ANOVA and linear regression. Results A total of 82 patients 18 years and older underwent cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery in the above-mentioned period. Three patients undergoing heart or lung transplantation, who thus received methylprednisolone, were excluded; a further two patients who received hydrocortisone for allergic reactions were also excluded. Data were incomplete for one patient, leaving a total of 76 patients for analysis. The mean lactate level was 1.2 mmol/l in the 47 patients who did not receive steroids and 2.6 mmol/l in the 29 patients who received dexamethasone (P <0.0001, Figure 1 ). When adjusting for potential confounders such as age, glucose level, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and preoperative NYHA heart failure classifi cation, this diff erence remained signifi cant (P <0.0001).",

The antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is expressed in macrophages upon stimulation by 25OHD 3 . sCD163 is a soluble pattern-recognition receptor, which is a marker of macrophage activation and a predictor of mortality in SIRS. The aim of this study is to unravel the impact of 25OHD 3 defi ciency and normalization on innate immunity parameters -CRP, LL-37 and sCD163 -in critical illness. Methods We randomly allocated patients upon ICU admission to receive either placebo (n = 13) or a 10-day treatment of 15 \u03bcg/day 25OHD 3 intravenously after a loading dose of 200 \u03bcg intravenously (n = 11) on top of the normal vitD dose (200 IU). Patients with chronic bone or kidney disease, glucocorticoid treatment, age younger than 18 years, or with an anticipated ICU length of stay less than 10 days were excluded. On admission, patients were compared with healthy age-matched, gendermatched and BMI-matched controls (n = 24). Results Administration of the 25OHD 3 regimen resulted in a rapid and sustained increase of serum 25OHD 3 levels (P <0.05 vs placebo). 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 levels rose only transiently (P = 0.07 on day 1, P = 0.08 on day 2 vs placebo). 25OHD 3 and 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 levels were lower than those of healthy controls (sampled during summer). 25OHD 3 treatment had no signifi cant eff ect on CRP. On admission, LL-37 levels (26 \u00b1 6 \u03bcg/l) were comparable with those of healthy controls (22 \u00b1 2 \u03bcg/l).

            "text": "Introduction The aim of this study was to demonstrate improvements in both staff and patient experiences with end-of-life care. The ICU is a setting where death is common; it has been suggested that 20% of patients in the US die on the ICU [1] . Given that the majority of ICU deaths involve the withholding or withdrawing of treatment [2] , the importance of end-of-life care is clear. Despite this frequency, studies suggest that the current quality of end-of-life care is suboptimal on the ICU [3, 4] . As a result, we developed a new framework to address this issue. Methods We introduced our new framework over a 1-year period; we circulated questionnaires to the staff pre and post study to demonstrate any improvements in end-of-life care. Results Our framework was found to be helpful by 97% of respondents and was associated with an improvement in communication and knowledge of end-of-life care. We discovered an increase in the number of staff who felt that patients, along with having their analgesia/sedation needs met, were now experiencing care that was more conducive to a good quality of dying. The number of staff who now felt confi dent in managing withdrawal of care trended towards a signifi cant P value. See Figure 1 for details. Conclusions Quality of end-of-life care was improved with our new framework; however, further research is vital to ensure our patients receive the same kind of evidence-based medicine in their fi nal hours as they did during their acute illness.",

The fi rst step for the required social dialogue is to search for local customs for harmonisation with ethical and legal regulations, as well as the interests of physicians and patients. Methods In 2007 we performed the fi rst Hungarian survey with the purpose to learn more about the local practice of end-of-life decisions. Questionnaires were sent out electronically to 743 registered members of the Hungarian Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care. Respecting anonymity we have statistically evaluated 103 replies (response rate was 13.8%) and compared with data from other European countries.",

            "text": "Results As expected, it turned out from the replies that the practice of domestic intensive care physicians is very paternal and this is promoted by legal regulations that share a similar character. Intensive care physicians generally make their decisions alone (3.75/5 points) without respecting the opinion of the patient (2.57/5 points), the relatives (2.14/5 points) or other medical personnel (2.37/5 points). Furthermore they prefer not to start a therapy rather than withdraw an ongoing treatment. Nevertheless, the frequency of end-of-life decisions (3 to 9% of ICU patients) is similar to other European countries. Conclusions Hungarian intensive care physicians make end-of-life actions routinely. They usually decide based on their own opinion, slightly considering the opinion of nursing personnel, the patients or their relatives. They are not supported by the Hungarian legal regulation in making these decisions. Although the living will and the advanced directive are both acknowledged, they are not as widespread as required. Our study is the fi rst step to commence a social dialogue, which is taken in the evolution of end-of-life decision-making procedures.",

Thirty patients have NGAL \u2264155 ng/ml. When patients were classifi ed according to RIFLE score at 24 hours of admission, NGAL values at admission were 180 \u00b1 170 ng/ml in 36 patients with RIFLE 0, 243 \u00b1 317 ng/ml in seven patients with RIFLE R, 303 \u00b1 134 ng/ml in four patients with RIFLE I and 536 \u00b1 421 ng/ml in nine patients with RIFLE F (P = 0.003). One patient was discharged before 24 hours (NGAL<60 ng/ml); whereas three patients who died before 24 hours had NGAL at admission of 578 \u00b1 350 ng/ml. The area under the ROC curve of NGAL at admission for the prediction of AKI was 0.83 (95% confi dence interval 0.70 to 0.97, P = 0.001), with an optimal cutoff value of 277 ng/ml with 73% sensitivity and 77% specifi city",

Mechanical ventilation (MV) may be a risk factor for developing TRALI. We determined the infl uence of MV on the development of TRALI, combining a murine MV model causing ventilatorinduced lung injury with a model of antibody-induced TRALI[1,2]. Methods BALB/c mice (n = 84) were ventilated for 5 hours with low (7.5 ml/kg) or high (15 ml/kg) tidal volume, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 2 cmH 2 O and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 50%. After 3 hours of MV, TRALI was induced by infusion of MHC-I antibodies (4.5 mg/ kg), controls received vehicle. Nonventilated animals receiving vehicle, isotype or MHC-I antibodies served as additional controls. Results All animals receiving MHC-I antibodies developed TRALI within 2 hours. In mice in which TRALI was induced, MV with low tidal volumes aggravated pulmonary injury as evidenced by an increase in neutrophil infl ux, pulmonary and systemic levels of cytokines and lung histopathological changes compared with unventilated controls. The use of high tidal volume ventilation resulted in a further increase in protein leakage and pulmonary edema. Conclusions MV synergistically augmented lung injury during TRALI, which was even further enhanced by the use of injurious ventilator settings. Results suggest that MV may be a risk factor for the onset of TRALI and may aggravate the course of disease.References 1.

This knowledge is sometimes also used for a national civilian abroad. We propose to describe the epidemiology of medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) made in the past 10 years. Methods We analysed data for every patient evacuated since 1 January 2000 and noted the destination, the number of patients per fl ight, the age, the gender, the status (military or civilian), the pathology, the presence of a specialist in the medical team (intensivist, cardiologist, psychiatrist) and the recipient hospital. The presence of an intubated ventilated patient or transfusion in fl ight was studied. Results A total of 420 strategic MEDEVACs were carried out in 10 years (per year: 42 \u00b1 6.9) in favor of 529 patients, among whom 90% were French servicemen. Each fl ight carried between one and 15 patients. Europe represents 42% of the original location of evacuation, Africa 39% and the Middle East 17%. An anesthetist-resuscitator reinforced the medical team in 51.7% of the evacuations. The patients with respiratory assistance are present in 19.8% of the fl ights and transfusion occurred in 3.1% of the fl ights. Traumatic pathology is predominant (49.5% of patients), divided into three major causes nearly equally: road traffi c accident, ballistic and others. Burns represent a signifi cant proportion (6.8%) of the causes of evacuation. Other causes are represented by 30.2% for medical conditions (n = 160 among which 59 cardiac aff ections), 10.2% for nontraumatic surgical aff ections and 2% for psychiatry. Finally 25.5% of the patients were accommodated in an ICU, 6% in a specifi c center for treatment of burns, 35.3% in a service of surgery and 24.6% in medicine.ConclusionsIf the number of MEDEVACs is relatively stable over the past decade, destinations and causes are changing. Africa remains an usual location of evacuation, the part of Europe tends to decrease for the benefi t of the Middle East, which became in 2009 the predominant destination (21/47) stretching out the duration of fl ights. The causes of evacuations testify to the intensity of the commitment of French forces through traumatic aff ections, and in particular of ballistic origin, which are in 2009 the main traumatic aff ections (15/31). The corollary is an increase of the appeal to the resuscitators to deal with trauma patients. P275 Comparison of two disaster drills' management performed by trained and not-trained students: key times evaluation FL Barra, L Carenzo, PL Ingrassia, M Tengattini, F Prato, D Colombo, F Della Corte University of Eastern Piedmont ' Amedeo Avogadro' , Novara, Italy Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P275 (doi: 10.1186/cc8507)IntroductionThe aim of this report is to compare two disaster exercises' management of students with diff erent backgrounds. To our knowledge nobody has ever compared two exercises, probably because of the diffi culty in their evaluation. We implemented a tool for an objective evaluation[1]  and we used it for this purpose. Methods Both drills represented a ceiling collapse over a crowded room with a similar amount of casualties and similar severity index. The START triage system was used. The trained students (T) were attending the European Master in Disaster Medicine (EMDM), while the not-trained students (NT) were at the beginning of an introductory course in disaster medicine. During the exercises we recorded key victim-provider interaction times[2]  using victim-based data collection. Each victim had their own data card to record triage and time information. Results In this preliminary report we present data regarding the scene length of stay (LOS) and triage to collecting area/advanced medical post time (T-AMP). The LOS was 67.5 (50.0 to 111.0) minutes (25 to 75 IQR) for T as compared with 145.0 (110.0 to 150.0) minutes (25 to 75 IQR) for NTFigure (abstract P273). .001). Stratifi cation according to assigned triage code showed no diff erence for high-priority codes (reds and yellows) as opposed to the green code (55.0 (47.0 to 75.0) minutes for T vs 145.0 (141.0 to 155.0) minutes for NT with P <0.01). T-AMP was 10.0 (3.0 to 34.5) minutes for T as compared with 63.5 (19.5 to 104.3) minutes for NT (P <0.001). Stratifi cation according to triage code showed no diff erence for red codes between T and NT but showed a diff erence for yellow codes (36.5 (15.0 to 82.0) vs 71.0 (30.0 to 99.0) minutes) and green codes (7.0 (3.0 to 12.0) vs 85.0 (17.3 to 115.0) minutes) with P <0.01.",

At that, generalized manifestation of infl ammatory reaction in the infectious patients was characterized by at mean fi vefold increase in IL-8 on day 3 of the follow-up.

The aim of the present work was to test whether the maintenance of normocapnia during a protective OLV strategy results in alteration of cerebral blood fl ow and cerebral oxygen saturation. Methods Data were obtained from 15 patients undergoing thoracic surgery and necessitating OLV of more than 1 hour. Cerebral oxygen saturation (Satcereb) was continuously monitored by the INVOS 5100C Cerebral Oxymeter System along with measurement of cerebral blood fl ow velocity (MCAV) by transcranial Doppler sonography. Arterial blood samples were taken for blood gas analysis in the awake state, in the supine position after induction during DLV, in the lateral decubitus position during DLV and every 15 minutes during OLV. Results Satcereb increased signifi cantly when DLV was started with FiO 2 1.0 and remained stable during the course of the study. When ventilation was changed from DLV to OLV, no signifi cant change was observed. A signifi cant decrease of cerebral oxygen saturation was found compared with the value observed during DLV in the lateral decubitus at the time point of 60 minutes after the start of OLV. No signifi cant changes in the MCAV were observed throughout the course of the thoracic surgical procedure.Conclusions OLV does not result in clinically relevant decreases in cerebral blood fl ow and cerebral oxygen saturation during application of lung-protective ventilation if normocapnia is maintained.P350 Factors aff ecting the transient hyperaemic response test of the cerebral autoregulation MS Sitina, V Cerny University Hospital, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P350 (doi: 10.1186/cc8582) Introduction The transient compression of the internal carotid artery (ICA) results in dilatation of cerebral arterioles by eff ect of autoregulation.In the THR test, the increase in middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood fl ow immediately after release of transient compression of the ICA is measured, which is proportional to cerebral autoregulation. The aim of the study was to determine the signifi cance of several factors of the test -blood fl ow inertia (acceleration), dimensions (length and radius) of ICA, patency of the Circle of Willis (WC), and asynchrony between release of ICA compression and arterial pressure pulsations (phase shift). Methods We constructed a mathematical model of the elements included in the THR test and simulated, using various parameters, blood fl ow in cerebral vessels and the increase in fl ow velocity in the MCA after release of ICA compression. We simulated two extreme situations -a perfectly patent (all aff erent and eff erent arteries meet in one point) and a completely isolated Circle of Willis (ICA bifurcates into only the anterior and middle cerebral arteries). The series of ordinary diff erential equations describing the THR test was solved by MATLAB R2008a. The solution assumed an absence of autoregulation (eff ect of studied factors is independent of autoregulation) and the rigidity of all vessels.ResultsThe eff ects of acceleration (inertia), dimensions of ICA and patency of WC are negligible. The eff ect of phase shift (Figure 1) can signifi cantly decrease the immediate post-release MCA fl ow, which can entirely nullify the increase in post-release MCA fl ow caused by autoregulation. Conclusions The eff ect of phase shift can signifi cantly alter the results of the THR test. For practical purposes we recommend calculation of THR test parameters from the second peak of post-release MCA fl ow, or using the highest post-release MCA fl ow from several THR tests.",

The aim of this prospective observational sub-study was to evaluate the eff ect of NTG on intestinal microcirculatory fl ow index (MFI) compared with sublingual MFI in the early phase of sepsis. Methods Eight patients (>18 years) with abdominal sepsis were included. Sublingual and intestinal side-stream dark fi eld (SDF) images were obtained and MFIs were calculated. Patients received NTG intravenously for 24 hours (2 mg/hour), after fulfi llment of protocol-driven resuscitation endpoints. Nonparametric tests were used to compare MFI baseline with 24 hours and for comparison within groups. Data are expressed as median (IQR). Results At baseline, sublingual and intestinal MFI did not diff er signifi cantly (2.2 (1.2 to 1.8) vs 2,7 (1.1 to 2.8), P = 0.89). After 24 hours, sublingual and intestinal MFI were nonsignifi cantly higher in comparison with baseline (2.33 (0.48 to 3), P = 0.94 vs 2.75 (2.13 to 2.98), P = 0.67). Furthermore, groups did not diff er signifi cantly (P = 0.46). However, one patient (number 13) showed a striking decrease in sublingual MFI after 24 hours, whereas intestinal MFI did not change over time. In another patient (number 25), sublingual MFI improved with a concomitant reduction in intestinal MFI over time(Figure 1). Conclusions In this small population of septic patients we could not detect signifi cant diff erences between the sublingual and intestinal microcirculation in response to NTG after a strict resuscitation protocol.

Transpulmonary thermodilution cardiac output monitoring and calculation of volumetric indices of preload was performed with the PiCCO system. Haemodynamic variables and IAP were analysed pre and post intervention. The control group comprised of cirrhotic patients with IAH requiring abdominal paracentesis (PC). In the CP group, IAP did not correlate with ITBVI. Conclusions Compared with cirrhotic patients with ascites, patients with BCS and IAH have evidence of central hypovolaemia. We postulate that in addition to raised IAP, hepatic venous obstruction and caudate lobe hypertrophy limit venous return in patients with BCS. Reduction in IAP restores preload with improvement in cardiac output. References Introduction Stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) are standardized into the stroke index (SI) and cardiac index (CI) by dividing by the patient's body surface area (BSA). Commonly used algorithms in hemodynamic management suggest diverse therapeutic interventions based on low, high, or normal SI or CI. Morbid obesity is increasingly common. When morbidly obese patients have their SV or CO indexed, high absolute values become low SI and CI, and may be misleadingly low. This would then cause therapeutic interventions opposite to their needs.",

NAVA can be used as a supporting and weaning mode of ventilation[1][2][3]. However, a level of NAVA corresponding to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) in patients ready for extubation has not been established. Methods We carried out a prospective study in the medical ICU at Phramongkutklao Hospital involving patients who were considered by their physicians to be ready for extubation. Patients initially received PSV of 5 cmH 2 O, PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O, and FiO 2 of 40% for 15 minutes (PS). Subsequently, each patient received a trial of NAVA mode with PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O, and FiO 2 of 40% for 15 minutes (NAVA), and, fi nally, a 30-minute spontaneously breathing trial without ventilatory support (SBT). During these trials, the minute volume (MV), respiratory rate, EAdi, and airway pressure were measured. We determined the corresponding NAVA level with the level of PSV of 5 cmH 2 O and PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O using the NAVA level matching MV (\u00b110%) received from the PSV.ResultsThe NAVA level corresponding to the PSV of 5 cmH 2 O and PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O was 0.52 cmH 2 O/\u03bcV (0.2 to 1.2). The airway pressure during NAVA was 5.97 cmH 2 O (3.2 to 8) above PEEP level. The peak EAdi was not signifi cantly diff erent between the PS, NAVA, and SBT (11.58, 12.06 vs 12.65 \u03bcV; P = 0.6). Also, there was no signifi cant diff erence in MV during the PS, NAVA, and SBT. Conclusions NAVA mode can be used as a weaning mode by decreasing the NAVA level. The reduced level of NAVA to 0.5 cmH 2 O/\u03bcV did not load respiratory muscle more than a low level of PSV and SBT. Thus, a NAVA level of 0.5 cmH 2 O/\u03bcV might be the level that is safe to discontinue ventilator support in patients without problems for resuming spontaneous breathing. References1.

Methods A total of 92 pediatric patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II; age 3 to 12 years) undergoing ophthalmologic surgery were randomly allocated to the standard or rotational technique groups. In the standard technique group (n = 46), ProSeal laryngeal mask airway insertion was performed by a single experienced user using digital manipulation. In the rotational technique group (n = 46), the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway was rotated counterclockwise through 90\u00b0 in the mouth and advanced until the resistance of the hypopharynx was felt, and then straightened out in the hypopharynx (n = 80). The ease of insertion was assessed by the success rate at the fi rst attempt. Heart rate and mean blood pressure were recorded 1 minute before and 1 minute after insertion. Postoperative complications were noted.ResultsThe success rate of insertion at the fi rst attempt was higher for the rotational technique (95.7% vs 76.1%, P <0.001). The overall success ratethat is, successful insertion within three attempts -was 100% for the both techniques. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure and heart rate increased signifi cantly with the standard technique (P <0.001). Systolic blood pressure and heart rate increased signifi cantly with the rotational technique (P <0.01). The incidence of blood staining (8.7% vs 23.9%, P = 0.048) was lower with the rotational technique. Conclusions The rotational technique is more successful than the standard technique and is associated with less pharyngeal mucosal trauma, as evidenced by a lower incidence of mucosal bleeding.

In our ICU we have the availability of diff erent intubation aids, and perform an annual training course on diffi cult intubation strategy. We wanted to evaluate the incidence of diffi cult intubation, together with the complication rate and the use of intubation aids in our ICU. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study in a 56-bed academic tertiary care hospital of all patients requiring intubation during their ICU stay during a 5-month observation period in 2008. Standardized data forms were used to collect detailed information on the intubating physicians, supervisors, techniques, medications and complications.ResultsWe enrolled 120 patients requiring immediate intubation in 37.5%, semi-urgent (<30 minutes) intubation in 50.8%, and semi-elective intubation in 11.7%. All intubations were successful. Diffi cult intubation was anticipated in 17.5% of all cases, although only 28% of these eff ectively proved to be diffi cult. Immediate intubation was possible in 74.2% of all cases, and diffi cult intubation (at least three attempts) occurred in 6.6%. Furthermore, 4.2% of intubations required 10 minutes or more. Nonexperts experienced more complications, and performed successful intubation in only 37.7%. One-third of all intubations were supervised by an intensive care physician, although this was not associated with a decrease of complication rate (65% vs 57.5%). Techniques most commonly used for diffi cult intubation management were change in intubator (48.4%), change in patient position (29%), BURP maneuver (19.3%) and use of a Gum elastic bougie (19.3%). Overall risk of complications occurring was 76.6%. Hypoxia was most common (40%), followed by hypotension (31.6%), heart rhythm disorders (4.1%) and oesophageal intubation (3.3%). Neuromuscular blockade was used in all but one patient. Hypnomidate was used in 31.6% of intubations, preferentially in patients with shock.The rate of complications or mortality did not signifi cantly diff er according to the hypnotic drug used. Conclusions Intubation in the ICU is frequently associated with complications, most commonly hypoxia and hypotension. The use of the Gum elastic bougie is required in 19.3% of cases, and results in achieving a 100% successful intubation rate. medical, three surgical, two neurosurgical). Laryngoscopes in the Cleveland Clinic are routinely checked twice daily by healthcare workers.

Adequacy of lighting is subjective; however, the Health and Safety Executive suggests 500 Lux as a minimum for work requiring the perception of fi ne detail [1]. Methods In a single-day spot audit, all clinically available laryngoscopes were evaluated for brightness.

We compared the ease of awake intubation using the A against the fi beroptic bronchoscope (F) in patients at increased risk for diffi cult tracheal intubation[2]. Methods In this randomised, controlled, clinical trial we enrolled patients at increased risk for diffi cult tracheal intubation, undergoing surgical operations requiring tracheal intubation. With ethics committee approval and written, informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to Fibroscope-guided tracheal intubation (F group) or Airtraq-guided intubation (A group). All patients, maintained in spontaneous breathing all through the procedure, received awake intubation performed by one of three anesthetists expert in diffi cult airway management. All patients received a topical airway anesthesia with 2% lidocaine and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) performed with propofol c.i. with an eff ecter site concentration of 1.5 \u03bcg/ml.Results  We enrolled 30 patients, 15 in the F group and 15 in the A group. All patients were successfully intubated in both groups. In group A we assessed a short time and a small amount of attempts of intubation with a statistically signifi cant diff erence between the two groups (P <0.05). No diff erence was noted between the two groups in hemodynamic setting, saturation, Ramsey score and airway-trauma-related side eff ects.

Introduction Tracheostomy in morbidly obese patients is generally performed by surgical technique. Although PDT has a low complication rate in nonobese patients, it is not technically possible to use standard PDT kits in morbidly obese patients with thick necks. The skin to trachea distance renders traditional-length tracheostomy tubes or dilators too short. Recently a tracheostomy kit (Uniperc, Smith Medicals, UK), designed for obese patients has become available. This kit consists of an S-shaped dilator and a long adjustable reinforced tracheostomy tube. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and complications of this new technique in morbidly obese patients. Methods The study was approved and patients' relatives were informed of the use of the new device. A total of 32 (male:female 21:11) morbidly obese (BMI mean 36 \u00b1 4.3) patients (aged 27 to 57 years) were enrolled.Patients were anaesthetised and ventilated with 100% oxygen. PDT was carried out under endoscopic control with stomal dilation using the single stage S-shaped dilator and a reinforced adjustable fl ange tracheostomy tube size 7 to 9 mm ID as required. Measurements were taken including the distance from skin to the trachea using the graduated introducer needle and the initial small dilator, neck circumference, and length of the tracheostomy tube at the skin. Complications including accidental extubation, paratracheal placement, pneumothorax, major or minor bleeding, hypoxia, transient hypotension, subcutaneous emphysema or death were recorded. Patients were followed up with the inner cannula changed every day. Results Thirty-two patients underwent PDT using this new kit. Patients were ventilated for a mean of 10 days (range 3 to 37) prior to tracheostomy. The mean neck circumference was 46.3 mm (37 to 55). The depth of the trachea from skin was a mean of 39 mm (15 to 80). The operators had no problem in stomal dilation using the single-stage dilator. The length of the tracheostomy tube adjusted at the skin ranged from 8 to 20 cm with a mean of 12 cm. No major complications were observed except two minor bleeding episodes and transient desaturation in one patient. The tracheostomy tube was decannulated after a mean of 25 days (6 to 82). Conclusions Bedside PDT can be performed in morbidly obese ICU patients using this new single-stage dilator and the adjustable fl ange reinforced tracheostomy tube with a low rate of complications. Further studies with longer-term follow-up are required.Introduction A tracheostomy procedure is indicated for urgent airway control, to avoid complications of lengthened endotracheal intubation",

Ciaglia's multiple dilatation technique, the Blue Rhino single dilatation technique, the Griggs dilatation forceps technique and the rotation-dilatation screw technique are the most preferred techniques for percutaneous tracheostomy[1,2]. The aim of this study is to retrospectively assess the techniques used for tracheostomy, tracheostomy time after intensive care admittance, length of intensive care stay and tracheostomy complications in our clinic. Methods After approval of the hospital ethics committee, fi les of the patients on whom the tracheostomy was performed between 2007 and 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic data of the patients, tracheostomy time after intensive care admittance, length of total intensive care stay and related complications were registered. Results Files of 35 patients were evaluated on whom tracheostomy was performed between 2007 and 2009. The male-to-female ratio was 17/18, mean age of the patients was 57.4 \u00b1 20.1 years (16 to 81 years, min to max), mean intensive care stay was 33.4 \u00b1 26.4 days (5 to 103 days, min to max).

The rotation-dilatation screw technique was used for 34 patients and the Griggs dilatation forceps technique was preferred for one of the patients. No complication was observed for any of the patients. Conclusions Studies comparing the ease of performance, early and late complications and long-term results of diff erent percutaneous tracheostomy techniques do not exist. Diff erent advantage/disadvantage ratios are reported in literature related to early and late tracheostomy performance time after admittance. In our clinic practice, the decision for the tracheostomy time is diff erent for each patient. The mean tracheostomy time shows our clinic prefers late tracheostomy. In the aspect of complications, we did not observe complications reported in the literature.References 1. Ciaglia P, et al.: Chest 1985, 87:715-719. 2.

Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy; 2 Postgraduate School of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University of Florence, Italy Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P221 (doi: 10.1186/cc8453)IntroductionThe Ciaglia Blue Rhino percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) technique, introduced in 1998 as a modifi cation of the original procedure described in 1985, has been indicated as procedure of choice (level 2C) because of its technical simplicity and short procedure time. Recently, a modifi ed balloon dilatation technique (Ciaglia Blue Dolphin) has been introduced with the intention to increase feasibility and safety. Here we report our initial experience in Ciaglia Blue Dolphin tracheostomy in comparison with a prospective control group of Ciaglia Blue Rhino procedures, which are actually the goal-standard in our ICU. Methods Twenty consecutively admitted patients in the Emergency Department ICU (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy) requiring percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) were treated with Ciaglia Blue Dolphin (fi rst 10, group D) and Ciaglia Blue Rhino (second 10, group R). Demographic, clinical and procedural data were collected. PDTs were all performed with bronchoscopic video guidance. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables. Results Patients of the two groups were similar for mean age (51.2 and 53.4 years old, respectively), body mass index (25.1 vs 24.8, respectively) and severity of illness (SAPS II: 44.3 vs 45.4, respectively). Group D showed a signifi cant higher procedural duration (measured from tracheal puncture to tracheostomy tube positioning) than group R (4.3 minutes vs 2.6 minutes; P <0.01). Conclusions Despite recent reports in literature, we did not found substantial advantage in the use of Ciaglia Blue Dolphin with respect to the wider accepted Ciaglia Blue Rhino. Moreover, the higher cost of the new kit should be taken into consideration. In our opinion, complications such as tracheal posterior wall injury, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum can be avoided using the bronchoscopic video guidance.P222 Recruitment maneuver for prevention of alevolar derecruitment during percutaneous dilation tracheostomy F Franchi, AI Di Chiaro, M Fiorillo, S Scolletta, P Mongelli, G Coratti, L Cubattoli University of Siena, Italy Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P222 (doi: 10.1186/cc8454)Introduction Alveolar derecruitment is an early complication of percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT). The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the effi cacy of performing a recruitment maneuver (RM) before tracheostomy, in order to prevent the alveolar derecruitment in critically ill patients. Methods We enrolled 16 patients admitted to the ICU between December 2008 and July 2009, with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \u22643 who underwent PDT. We used the Ciaglia/Blue Rhino technique with endoscopic guidance throughout the procedure. Patients were ventilated before and during PDT on volumecontrolled mechanical ventilation (tidal volume of 6 ml/kg body weight) and FiO 2 set at 1. Patients were randomized into two groups: MRa group (seven patients who underwent RM 10 minutes before PDT) and no-MRa group (nine patients without application of RM before PDT).

            "text": "Introduction Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has gained widespread acceptance in many ICU and trauma centers as a viable alternative approach. Numerous investigative reports show that all traditional techniques for PDT have similar complications. The most dangerous complication is posterior tracheal wall damage during insertion of the dilational device employing downward pressure. The Ciaglia Blue Dolphin (CBD) is an innovative device for PDT using radial balloon dilation. This technique has the potential advantage of less tracheal damage over other methods by avoiding downward pressure to enter the trachea[1,2]. Methods Case series of consecutive ICU patients with acute respiratory failure who required tracheostomy for failure to wean and continued mechanical ventilatory support. We report our clinical experience of 22 percutaneous tracheostomies performed using the CBD system (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA). Informed consent was obtained from each patient, or family member. All procedures were performed under direct visualization using a fi breoptic bronchoscope on anaesthetised patients. The technique relies on the employ of a balloon-tipped catheter loaded over the guidewire. The balloon was infl ated with saline up to 11 atmospheric pressure for 30 seconds to create a tracheostoma. A preloaded tracheostomy tube was then inserted through the stoma following balloon defl ation. Results Bedside PDT with the CBD system was successfully performed in the ICU for all 22 patients. Tracheostomies were performed within a mean time of 4.1 \u00b1 1.4 minutes of the tracheal needle entry and with negligible blood loss in all patients. The procedure was not associated with a decrease in SpO 2 at the time of balloon infl ation. Procedural complications were limited to one patient requiring the repetition of balloon infl ation for tracheostomy tube placement. There were no other immediate medical or technical problems. Conclusions The CBD has been shown to be a safe, quick and successful alternative to the traditional PDT (PercuTwist, guidewire dilating forceps, and so forth) that have a tendency to go too far and perforate the tracheal rings: the intensivist performing PDT should be aware when making the decision as to which approach to use. In our hospital, the CBD method has become the procedure of choice. References Introduction Because recovery of an effi cient swallowing refl ex is a determining factor for patient's spontaneous rehabilitation of airway protective refl exes, we have studied the infl uence of cuff pressure of the tracheostomy tube on the swallowing refl ex elicited in tracheostomized ICU patients. Methods Twelve conscious eupneic adult patients were studied. Simultaneous electromyography of submental muscles[1]  and acceleromyography of laryngeal elevation[2]  were measured during refl ex swallows elicited by pharyngeal injection of distilled water. After cuff defl ation, instrumental characteristics of the swallowing refl ex (latency time, electromyography and acceleromyography peak and amplitude) were measured at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cmH 2 O of air-fi lled induced randomly imposed cuff pressure. Results Cuff pressure was inversely correlated to both electromyography and acceleromyography characteristics of the swallowing refl ex. Latency time of the swallowing refl ex and cuff pressure were linearly correlated. Instrumental characteristics of the swallowing refl ex deteriorated for a cuff pressure threshold >22 cmH 2 O (extremes 15 to 40). Conclusions We have demonstrated that instrumental characteristics of the swallowing refl ex were infl uenced by cuff pressure in the tracheostomy tube. Increasing cuff pressure aff ected both the setting and the muscular activity of submental muscles during refl ex swallows. Our data suggest that peripheral mechanical constraints and centrally controlled inhibition may be involved in cuff pressure rise induced deterioration of the swallowing refl ex. Our report has several implications for intensive care daily clinical practice. In case of dysphagia, swallowing function should be evaluated and re-educated with a cuff pressure tidily controlled at 20 cmH 2 O. References1. Nishino T: J Appl Physiol 1991, 70:888-993. 2.

We created a Code Critical Airway team to manage airway emergencies. Critical (diffi cult) airway emergencies are increasing due to advances in medical treatments, obesity and sleep apnea. Diffi cult airway events are low volume and high risk, requiring expert skill and communication. In the United States a leading level I adverse patient safety event is 'death or serious disability associated with airway management'[1]. Methods Utilizing a complex framework with the goal of successful airway management outcomes, the project was divided into six components: patient safety, includes the development of an airway management plan focused on improved team effi ciency and culture change from Panic Button to Bridge to Safety; patient assessment, includes the development of educational programs focusing on early recognition of potential critical airway patients; teamwork, includes the development of improved communication, paging and handoff processes; performance improvement, includes after-action reviews of each event to assess and address system and process issues; equipment, includes the development of standardized airway equipment at the bedside; and team simulation training, includes consistency in communication, handoff , teamwork and equipment use.ResultsThe average time to establish an airway across all techniques has been drastically reduced (55 minutes to 22 minutes), of special note is the dramatic improvement in the time to reintubation (18 minutes to 5 minutes). The number of surgical airways required reduced from fi ve pre-project to zero in phase two. Thirty-one percent of the airway patients were obese or had a short thick neck. We have seen an increase in our respiratory distress calls versus respiratory arrest calls, reinforcing the benefi t of proactive over reactive calling. Code Critical Airway education programs improved the number of appropriate Code Critical Airways being called, as well as improved overall Code Critical Airway Team response time. As a by-product of this process, reliability of available appropriate airway equipment is now 100%. Conclusions This project made signifi cant process improvements in the areas of patient safety, team communication, equipment availability and response effi ciency. Hospitals should develop a specialized airway team to decrease adverse airway events. References1.

Introduction Weaning from mechanical ventilation represents an important issue after cardiac surgery because a delayed extubation can burden the patient's recovery health, increasing the risk of infections and the length of hospital stay. Recognized parameters such as minute ventilation, negative inspiratory force, maximal inspiratory pressure ratio, and Tobin index do not predict very well the success of extubation in these patients. We tested whether hemodynamic parameters and indexes predict better successful extubation after cardiac surgery. Methods We prospectively evaluated 100 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with pump admitted to the InCor ICU and monitored with Swan-Ganz. Exclusion criteria were congenital diseases, transplantation procedures, chronic renal failure, and ejection fraction lower than 20%. Results Patients were considered for extubation if they tolerated a T-piece for 30 minutes. From 100 patients, 88 were successfully extubated and 12 patients failed. There was no diff erence between groups regarding baseline characteristics, including ejection fraction and co-morbidities. Univariate analysis showed in the successful group a lower duration of pump (55 minutes x 90 minutes, P = 0.038), a lower length of stay in ICU (12 x 32 days, P <0.0001), a lower BNP level (144 x 422, P = 0.002), and a higher PO 2 /FiO 2 (312 x 266, P = 0.043) and a higher VeRT (time recovery minute ventilation) 4 x 2, P <0.01. Multivariate analysis showed high levels of BNP and of PO 2 /FiO 2 at admission are strong predictors of successful weaning. Conclusions After cardiac surgery, lower levels of BNP and higher PO 2 / FiO 2 are predictors of successful weaning. This suggests that adequate hemodynamic optimization must be achieved in patients to improve outcomes as early weaning of mechanical ventilation. References 1.

The higher MET rate in medical vs surgical patients is unexpected compared with the published experience in Australian public hospitals. This may refl ect a diff erence in the patient population or a diff erence in the pre-MET ward management in our hospital. Whilst inpatient mortality was high, patients who died were mostly managed without transfer to the ICU and the non-NFR death rate was low. This is consistent with a signifi cant overlap between MET and end-of-life care. Alternatively the high mortality could refl ect that MET as an intervention occurs too late in these patients to favourably aff ect outcomes.

The short ICU stay and the absence of complications of these patients strengthen the inappropriateness of their admission, which was probably due to the lack of intermediate care units in Italy. The situation is completely diff erent considering the ICU stay: the inappropriateness rose up to 68%, mainly due to the presence of Ordinary patients. Almost one-half of them were patients recovered from sicker condition, who were probably diffi cult to discharge from the ICU. References Introduction Allergies to medication are common and potentially lifethreatening[1]. Patients enter critical care with incomplete information about their history. It is essential for safety that accurate allergy status is documented early in the critical care stay. This clinical audit (CA) was undertaken in a 43-bed, level 3 critical care unit to explore compliance with local guidelines on allergy documentation. Methods Critical care patient episodes were obtained retrospectively for a 1-month period. Timing of allergy documentation and drug prescribing was noted from the critical care electronic system (ICIP). Allergy status prior to the critical care admission and after discharge was noted from the ward drug chart. Additional allergy data were identifi ed from the hospital electronic patient record (EPR). The CA was repeated 1 year after implementation of recommendations. Results Patient episodes were collated (initial CA n = 58, repeat CA n = 79). A known drug/nondrug allergy was stated in 29.3% patient episodes during the initial CA and 39.2% patient episodes in the repeat CA. Allergy status was incomplete 24 hours after critical care admission for two patients at the initial CA with a reduction to zero during the repeat. Allergy status was incomplete prior to prescribing of a new drug in critical care (excludes fl uids, drugs required for emergency intubation) for 51.7% of patient episodes in the initial CA. This fi gure reduced to 19.0% in the repeat CA. Concordance between EPR and ICIP allergy at the outset was 68.8%, which increased to 76.5% in the repeat CA. Concordance with the ward drug chart preadmission and ICIP was 77.6%, increased to 93.9% at re-audit. Conclusions This CA suggests that up to one in three critical care patients have a known allergy. The potential for harm is high. More than onehalf of patients admitted to critical care did not have an allergy status documented prior to prescribing a new drug. There was signifi cant discordance between the paper medication chart and ICIP allergy. A number of factors were introduced following initial fi ndings, including making the allergy status mandatory on ICIP, not allowing the admission summary to be saved prior to allergy documentation and ensuring current allergy documentation on EPR.Reference 1. Bates DW, et al.: JAMA 1995, 274:29-34.Introduction An anonymous error reporting system was trialled to establish whether error reporting rates would improve and to allow the identifi cation of medication incidents. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) feedback report for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital shows that, compared with similar organisations, medication error reporting is low. A review of the medication incidents reported for the critical care facility in 2007 and 2008 had only 19 events. Error rates in the ICU are typically higher than in other acute settings, one study reporting 10.5 medication errors per 100 bed-days",

The numbers of incidents reported increased as the week progressed, with the largest number occurring on a Friday (24%). A review of the types of medicines involved showed that insulins, proton pump inhibitors, anticoagulants, vancomycin, and epidurals were recurring themes, refl ecting NPSA alerts. When graded for signifi cance, two were found to be harmful, 56 signifi cant and 54 insignifi cant. Conclusions There is clearly considerable under-reporting of medication errors in critical care via the offi cial incident reporting system. One of many reasons for poor offi cial reporting of errors is the lack of tangible local response to those errors. It is therefore important that the areas highlighted by our project are eff ectively addressed, not only to improve safety but also to encourage further reporting and work to develop a culture of incident reporting within critical care. Reference Methods Between October 2006 and October 2008 the IHI coached and advised our institution on mechanisms to improve quality of care. The aim was to develop systems of healthcare that were reliable at least 95% of the time. The changes to be introduced -central line bundle, ventilator bundle, hand hygiene, daily patient goals -were led by a small multidisciplinary team chaired by a hospital executive (fi nance director) who met every 2 weeks for 2 years for short meetings (~1/2 hour). Our aim was to reduce nosocomial infection and mortality. Results It took ~12 months to introduce reliable process in all areas. Hand hygiene improved from ~70% compliance to consistently >95%. MRSA acquisition on the ICU reduced from about 10% of patients prior to October 2006 to 0.3%. VAP was reduced (Figure 1). The average unadjusted mortality was reduced year on year despite similar mean APACHE II and ICNARC scores(Figure 2). Conclusions Reliable evidence-based processes for patient care can signifi cantly reduce nosocomial infection and mortality.

All patients who were inserted CVCs by inexperienced trainees (postgraduate year 1 to 6) between 1 June 2008 and 31 October 2009 were included. The following parameters were evaluated: the rate of successful insertions, the incidence of complications, the site of CVC insertion, the method of US use, and the postgraduate year of the trainees. We defi ned success of CVC insertion if a trainee completes catheterization without complication and personnel exchange. We compared the success rate and the complication rate with both insertion sites and US techniques; Group SA (surface anatomy) underwent CVC insertion using the landmark technique, Group indirect-ultrasound (iUS) using ultrasound image-based skin surface marking, and Group direct-US (dUS) using realtime ultrasound guidance. The chi-test was used for analysis and P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant. Results In total 593 CVCs were inserted, 527 via the internal jugular vein (IJV), and 66 via the subclavian vein (SV). The IJV approach includes 52 patients (9.9%) in Group SA, 145 patients (27.5%) in Group iUS, and 330 patients (62.6%) in Group dUS. The SV approach, on the other hand, consisted of 26 patients (39.4%) in Group SA, and 40 patients (60.6%) in Group dUS. The success rate of CVC insertion of the IJV approach linearly rose in Group SA, Group iUS and Group dUS (76.9%, 81.4%, 88.2%, P = 0.033), but in the SV approach there is no signifi cant diff erence between Group SA and Group dUS (76.9%, 75.0%, P = 0.83). Five patients who underwent real-time US via the SV developed pneumothorax while no one in Group SA had the complication (P = 0.57). Conclusions The use of ultrasound guidance improves the success rate of CVC insertion via the IJV by inexperienced trainees. However, in the SV approach the effi cacy of ultrasound guidance is not proven, and the incidence of pneumothorax increased in our study.P462Performance analysis of an ICU according to GiViTI's StART approach R Rosi 1 , V Peccianti 1 , E Fatighenti 1 , M Giardino 2 , D Crespi 2 , A Anghileri 2 AOUS, Siena, Italy; 2 Istituto Mario Negri, Ranica (BG), Italy Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P462 (doi: 10.1186/cc8694) Introduction ICU beds are a limited resource; their appropriate use is mandatory: only patients sick enough should be admitted to the ICU, and all admitted patients should receive the adequate level of care. Methods From 1 January 2008 to 9 March 2009, 716 admissions to a seven-bed general ICU were analyzed according to GiViTI's StART approach, to evaluate appropriateness of the ICU admission and stay. Available resources (ICU beds) were classifi ed as High Level (HL) or Low Level (LL), according to equipment and staffi ng. Patients may require High (H), Low (L), or Ordinary (O) levels of care (HP, LP, OP, respectively)[1]. OPs should not be admitted to the ICU and can stay in the ICU only briefl y, following HL or LL periods. One nurse can attend two HPs, or one HP and two LPs, or four LPs, provided that each bed can be controlled easily (not in diff erent rooms, for example)[2]. For each day shift, matching of required and available care was analyzed: mismatch is expressed as nurse defi cit: positive values indicate excess of care (too many nurses for not too sick patients), zero suggests that assistance requirements are met, with negative values available care is less than patients' needs.ResultsIn this ICU, all seven beds are fully equipped. Of the 716 ICU admissions, 20 (2.8%) were inappropriate OPs. One hundred and ninetyseven further ICU-days of the 2,711 available (7.3%) were used for OPs (mostly due to delayed discharges); altogether 217/3,427 (6.3%) ICUdays were inappropriately used for OPs. In the analysis of resources and requirements matching, if the seven beds were in the same room, available assistance would meet requirements in most nurse shifts, even if the staff would have worked at maximum almost always; in fact, in this ICU, four beds are in a room and there are three single-bed rooms -therefore, according to the suggested standards, a mean 1.9 nurse defi cit per shift is observed. The relevance of this observation on patient outcome can be speculated only. Conclusions The relevance of the StART approach is the defi nition of inappropriateness both from excess and insuffi ciency of care points of view: both admissions and ICU stays of OPs and/or too many too sick patients for the amount of care available are equally inappropriate. Moreover, the available care is determined both by the number of ICU nurses and by logistic constraints: seven beds in an open space are diff erent from four beds in a room and three beds in single rooms, and in fact this ICU pays a two nurse defi cit per shift to its design.References 1.

Simulation training at the point of care to decrease the incidence of airway complications on the intensive care unit SC Cook, JJ Gatward, FE Kelly, J Bell, FM O'Higgins, MJ Thomas Bristol Royal Infi rmary, Bristol, UK Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P463 (doi: 10.1186/cc8695) Introduction A recent analysis of critical incidents reported to the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) by ICUs in the UK revealed a signifi cant number of airway incidents in critical care[1]. We recently performed an online survey with responses from 305 trainees from across the UK regarding airway management and complications on the ICU. The results revealed a high number of adverse airway events including 27 deaths. A large number of junior trainees (many of whom cover the ICU alone at night) expressed low confi dence levels with airway management in critical care, and the majority of all trainees felt inexperienced with tracheostomy care and emergencies. Simulation has been recommended as a suitable way of providing critical incident training[2], and simulation at the point of care has been shown to be especially powerful and eff ective[3]. Methods In response to our survey, we set up a multidisciplinary simulation-based airway teaching programme for all staff on our unit. A Resusci-Annie\u2122 manikin with an Airway Trainer\u2122 head (Laerdel, Norway) is set up in a bed space on our ICU. Realistic patient monitoring is achieved with the Laerdel SimMan\u2122 software (free from the Laerdel website). We have written a number of scenarios in response to incidents and training defi ciencies highlighted by our survey. Scenarios are run with ICU staff from all disciplines acting within their normal roles. Realism is enhanced by staff practicing in their usual working environment, using the unit's own equipment. Results So far, we have trained 43 ICU staff . Feedback has been excellent, with scores ranging from 8.5 to 10. Participants were especially positive about the multidisciplinary aspect of the training and on practising uncommonly encountered scenarios in their normal workplace. This survey investigated current UK intensive care practice in testing patients for blood-borne viruses following needle stick injury when the patient lacks capacity for consent. Needle stick injuries are a common occurrence in the National Health Service, with an estimated incidence of 113 to 623/10,000 healthcare workers/per year[1]. Current UK law[2,3]  does not permit the testing of a patient's infective status for the benefi t of a healthcare worker involved without the patient's consent. Incapacitated patients cannot give consent. The General Medical Council (GMC) guidance for the management of needle stick injuries from incapacitated patients refl ects this[4]. Methods A questionnaire was sent to the clinical lead of the 225 general ICUs within England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Responses were anonymous.Results Ninety-nine consultants replied out of 225 (44% response rate). Sixty-two of the 99 consultants (63%) reported incidences of needle stick injuries to their staff from incapacitated patients in the past year. In six incidents the patient was not tested because their full blood-borne virus status was already known. Thirty-six of the remaining 56 incidents (64.5%) stated that patients were tested without consent. Sixty-one per cent of consultants (22 of 36) reported that the patient was informed once conscious that the test had been performed. Two consultants discussed the decision to perform the test with the family prior to proceeding. One patient, not tested at the time of injury, refused consent on regaining capacity. Sixteen patients out of the 62 incidents were blood-borne viruspositive (26%), six being new diagnoses following the needle stick injury (37.5%). Conclusions Despite the recent change in legislation, the majority of incapacitated patients are being tested for blood-borne viruses when unable to give consent. This has signifi cant benefi cial eff ects for the healthcare worker involved; a negative test allowing prophylactic antiviral treatment to be discontinued and minimises anxiety. This survey highlights the need for further discussion involving healthcare professionals, the legal profession and legislators regarding needle stick injuries from incapacitated patients. Is there a duty of care to the healthcare worker that is not acknowledged in current legislation? References Introduction In the ICU, daily goals have improved the eff ectiveness of communication within care teams[1]. The study objective was to investigate the eff ect of explicit daily goals in ICU practice on the length of intensive care stay, length of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and errors of omission in patient care. Methods A multicenter, sequential cohort, pretest-post-test study was performed. During the pretest phase, daily goals were formulated by staffphysicians, evaluated by a research physician and kept blinded for the rest of the ICU team. Subsequently, daily goals were broadly implemented. During the post-test phase, daily goals were routine practice. Patient data were collected one full year before (as baseline reference) and during the pretest and post-test phases. During pretest and post-test, medical charts (random subsets of 10 patients a week) were reviewed for errors of omission, defi ned as deviations from our care protocols. Patient data were compared with data from nonparticipating academic ICUs, extracted from the National Intensive Care Evaluation database.ResultsTwo academic ICUs participated in the study. Patients included: baseline reference n = 3,641; pretest n = 3,401, and post-test 3,426. ICU mean (SD) length of stay (days) diff ered signifi cantly between the pretest phase 5.7 (2) and the post-test phase 4.3 (2.3), diff erence 1.4 days (95% CI 1.3/1.5). The post-ICU length of hospital stay decreased in the post-test phase, mean diff erence 2.3 days (95% CI 1.2/3.4). Median (IQR) duration of mechanical ventilation during pretest was 2 (1 to 4) days and during posttest was 1 (1 to 4) days, P <0.001. The probability of an error of omission was signifi cant larger in the pretest phase then in the post-test phase, RR 6.5 (5.7/7.4). Conclusions The results showed a signifi cant decrease in ICU LOS, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of post-ICU stay following DGF implementation. Also the chance of errors of omission to occur was six times lower, which indicates a signifi cant increase in protocol adherence. The drawback of the study design (historic control group and a pretest and post-test for comparison) was limited by comparing the study results with other academic centers during the same time frame. Reference IntroductionThe role of isolation rooms in decreasing bacterial transmission between ICU patients has been debated. A recent change in ICU location allowed for further investigation. Methods Old ICU A and Old ICU B were open-plan seven-bed and four-bed units. In March 2007, ICU A moved to single patient rooms (New ICU Aeight beds). ICU B remained unchanged (New ICU B). The same physicians cover both ICUs. Patient distribution is based on available space only. Demographic and microbiological data were collected on consecutive patients staying >48 hours. Culture of resistant organisms (MRSA, VRE, ESBL, resistant Acinetobacter, or carbapenem-resistant Gram-negatives) in surveillance or clinical cultures was measured. New ICU A was compared with open-plan New ICU B to assess the eff ect of single rooms. New ICU A was compared with Old ICU A to assess change vs historical controls and New and Old ICU B were compared with show control group stability. Results Data were collected on 62, 62, 44 and 39 patients from Old ICU A, New ICU A, Old ICU B and New ICU B. Patient populations in New ICU A and B were similar. ICU acquisition of resistant organisms was lower in New ICU A (3/62, 5% vs 7/39, 18% New ICU B patients, P = 0.043). This fi nding was confi rmed using survival analysis (P = 0.011). Comparing New withOld ICU A showed lower APACHE II scores (18 \u00b1 9 vs 21 \u00b1 9, P = 0.028), pre-ICU antibiotic use (20/62, 32% vs 37/62, 60%, P = 0.001), pre-ICU hospital admission (21/62, 34% vs 37/62, 60%, P = 0.004) and ICU admission prevalence of resistant organisms (11/62, 18% vs 25/62, 40%, P = 0.006). On Cox regression only the admitting ICU was signifi cant for acquisition of resistant organisms (Old vs New ICU A: HR 4.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 16.06, P = 0.025). Comparing New with Old ICU B showed no changes. Adequate hand hygiene amongst the same physicians was found on 140/242 (58%) occasions in New ICU A vs 23/66 (35%) in New ICU B (P <0.001). Conclusions The change in ICU design to single patient rooms signifi cantly decreased acquisition of multiresistant organisms. Whether the ICU design or improved infection control awareness led to change could not be determined. This is the fi rst study to measure the eff ect of ICU design on acquisition of a range of resistant organisms while including a contemporaneous control ICU environment.IntroductionThe National Confi dential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) recommends that all new admissions to the ICU should be reviewed by a consultant intensivist within 12 hours[1]. This early review may reduce the ICU length of stay (LOS), but does not appear to aff ect mortality[2]. Patient severity of illness (APACHE II scores) may also infl uence patient outcome. Methods The database of our clinical information system (MetaVision, iMDsoft) was interrogated and 116 new consecutive critical care admissions were retrospectively reviewed. We ascertained the time to fi rst review (in hours) by a consultant intensivist from MetaVision entry logs. Patient outcomes including mortality and LOS were also captured for patients reviewed early (<12 hours) and late (>12 hours). The admission APACHE II score was also calculated. Continuous and ordered categorical variables are expressed as the median and analysed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Outcome binary variables were analysed by the chi-squared test. P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant.ResultsThe early reviewed group (n = 53) had a median fi rst review time of 4.35 hours (IQR 1.70 to 6.90), median LOS of 46 hours (IQR 22 to 86) and mortality of 17% (n = 9). The late review group (n = 63) had a median fi rst review time of 16.55 hours (IQR 14.35 to 18.88), median LOS of 25 hours (IQR 20 to 46) and mortality of 1.6% (n = 1). The median admission APACHE II score for the early group and late group was 14 (IQR 10 to 24) and 10 (IQR 8 to 16), respectively. There was no signifi cant diff erence in LOS between the two groups (P = 0.137, two-sample Mann-Whitney U test). The early group had a signifi cantly higher mortality (P = 0.03, chi-squared test) and admission APACHE II score (P = 0.04, two-sample Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusions We were unable to demonstrate that early consultant intensivist review of new critical care admissions reduces the LOS or mortality. Despite early consultant intensivist review, this group had a signifi cantly higher mortality. A signifi cantly higher severity of illness in the early group may account for this higher mortality.Introduction Communication with conscious patients who are on oxygen and cannot verbally communicate due to temporary loss of speaking ability has proven to be anywhere from problematic to extremely diffi cult for the nursing staff trying to understand the needs of the patients. Methods In order to improve the situation of conscious patients on oxygen, it is fi rst necessary to conduct a status quo analysis to determine which communication aids can be implemented in the care of such patients. For this reason, a questionnaire was designed and carried out with the staff of the ICU. Results The questionnaire of the intensive care staff showed that from 31.7% (20 staff members), the use of diverse electronic aids was indicated 10 times as a means for improvement in the communication situation of conscious patients on oxygen. A further question regarding communication aids that the intensive care staff would like -but are not available in the ward -resulted in the computer being named as the most wanted communication aid. In cooperation with the engineering secondary school (HTL M\u00f6ssingerstra\u00dfe) a special keyboard was developed especially to suit the needs of conscious patients on oxygen and an operating system was installed on computers the general hospital made available. Conclusions The results indicated that the communication between the patients and the nursing staff using the computer showed a 50% improvement in understanding the needs of the patient from the point of view of the nursing staff . Thirty percent of the patients had tracheotomies and 20% were aphasia patients.IntroductionThis study looks at the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to an ICU after bariatric surgery and considers the staffi ng and fi nancial implications for the National Health Service (NHS). There is currently increased government incentive to treat obese patients with bariatric surgery with the aim of reducing co-morbidities in the future. Methods A retrospective analysis of bariatric surgery patients requiring an ICU admission between 1 February 2007 and 31 August 2009. The study was carried out in a nine-bed mixed medical and surgical adult ICU providing level 2 and level 3 critical care to a 430-bed hospital in East London with a regional laparoscopic bariatric surgery service. Medical records were reviewed and information including gender, body mass index (BMI), age, reason for admission, treatment required and length of stay in the unit was collected. APACHE II and SOFA scores were calculated. Results A total of 502 bariatric operations were performed during this period. Twenty-four (4.8%) patients required ICU admission at a cost of \u00a32,500 (\u20ac2,750) per day for an average of 8.7 days (range 1 to 48). The average length of stay for all elective admissions was 2 days and for emergency admissions was on average 10 days. Cumulatively, bariatric patients spent a total of 209 days on the unit costing \u00a3522,500 (\u20ac575,300).The average weight was 146 kg (range 71 to 320 kg). The average BMI was 53.3 (range 32.1 to 102.1). The age range was 24 to 69 (mean 48)",

Methods Three CHs with 60 beds each were equipped with a telepresence system that includes: high-speed connectivity, wireless Internet access, a RP-7i robot (InTouch Health, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and a central computer based at a high-care hospital. The CHs give medical care to people without social security and are far away from the capital city at not less than 63 km (Atlacomulco 63 km, Valle de Bravo 85 km and Tejupilco 90 km). The program was designated to assist physicians in ACFs, which include emergency rooms (ERs) and ICUs during the second wave of an infl uenza AH1N1 outbreak in Mexico. The program includes: rounds at the ACF and isolation area for patients with infl uenza-like syndrome (ILS) every day from 9 am to 15 pm from Monday to Friday given by the MPH specialist team (intensivist), mechanical ventilation supervision (MV), transfer from CHs to high-care hospitals, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Additionally, interventions in critically ill patients were recorded. Results From 3 October to 30 November, 56 patients with ILS were assisted by the MPH team: three patients in Atlacomulco CH, six in Valle de Bravo CH and 47 in Tejupilco CH. The mean age was 45.3 years old (from 19 years to 84 years), 32 were female (57%). A confi rmatory test for AH1N1 was documented in 10 patients (17.8%). Patients assisted in the ER, three; in the ICU, nine; in the isolation area for infl uenza, 44 patients. The mean LOS for all patients was 3.6 days, 3.4 days for patients in the isolation area, 6.5 days in the ICU and 1 day in the ER. There were fi ve patients on mechanical ventilation (8.9%) and two patients were pregnant (3.5%). Mortality was observed in fi ve patients (8.9%) and the mortality rate in the ICU was 50%. Additionally, two patients were transferred to a high-care hospital (one died). All patients who went on ventilatory support died during the fi rst day on MV. Conclusions This preliminary report shows that the practice of telepresence using robots at acute care facilities during an infl uenza outbreak is feasible at CHs in Mexico.P476Association between out of hours discharge from the ICU and subsequent readmission S Gopal, L Terry, C Corbett Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, Wolverhampton, UK Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P476 (doi: 10.1186/cc8708) Introduction Readmission to the ICU may be considered a benchmark quality indicator on an ICU. Previous studies have assessed the impact of out of hours discharge from the ICU and subsequent outcome[1,2]. We hypothesized that patients who were discharged from the ICU after hours were at higher risk of readmission to the ICU than patients discharged during daylight hours. Methods The database of a 15-bed medico-surgical ICU of a teaching hospital was retrospectively interrogated from the period 1 October 2007 to 31 July 2009. Patients who died whilst on the ICU were excluded from the study. Demographic details were collected as well as the date and time of discharge from the ICU. Readmissions to the ICU were defi ned as readmissions if they occurred during the same hospital admission episode. Out of hours discharges were defi ned as discharges occurring between the hours of 20:00 and 09:00. Logistic regression analysis wasFigure 1 (abstract P473). Costs by type of prescriber.used to assess the relationship between timing of discharge from the ICU and risk of readmission. Results The database contained 1,257 patients during the study period, of whom 207 died whilst on the ICU. A total of 1,050 patients were therefore included in the study. Two hundred and forty-nine patients (24%) were discharged between 20:00 and 09:00. Ninety-fi ve patients (9%) were discharged and subsequently readmitted to the ICU during the same hospital admission episode. Compared with patients discharged between the hours of 09:00 and 20:00, patients discharged between the hours of 20:00 and 09:00 were 2.74 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.3) times more likely to be readmitted to the ICU during the same admission episode, P <0.001. This relationship remained true even after adjusting for potential confounders age, gender. OR 2.75 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.3). Conclusions Compared with patients discharged during the day, patients discharged during the night are at a signifi cantly increased risk of readmission to the ICU. Timing of discharge from ICU may therefore be used as a quality indicator in benchmarking quality of care on an ICU. References1.

P477 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment in pandemic planning R Shahpori, T Stelfox, C Doig, P Boiteau, D Zygun Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P477 (doi: 10.1186/cc8709) Introduction The H1N1 pandemic has highlighted the importance of reliable and valid triage instruments for scarce resources during periods of high demand. Christian and colleagues have proposed a triage protocol that utilizes a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score >11 to exclude patients from critical care resources quoting an associated mortality of more than 90% [1]. We sought to assess the hospital mortality associated with this SOFA threshold and the resource implications of such a triage protocol. Methods This retrospective cohort study included consecutive ICU patients admitted to any one of our three tertiary-care adult multisystem ICUs from January 2003 to December 2008. Patients were excluded if they were admitted for routine postoperative monitoring (ICU stay <48 hours) or postoperative cardiac surgery. SOFA was collected daily by an electronic bedside clinical information system (QS; GE Medical Systems). Results A total of 10,204 patients (69,913 patient-days) were included. Mean age was 59. Mean admission APACHE was 19.1. Mortality was 25%.Median ICU LOS was 4 days. A total 13.4% of the cohort (representing 9% of total patient-days) had an initial SOFA >11. Mortality in patients with an initial SOFA score >11 was 59% (95% CI 56%, 62%).Figure 1demonstrates increased mortality associated with SOFA >11 during the ICU stay to a maximum of 78% (95% CI 68%, 86%) on day 14. The mortality associated with an initial SOFA >11 across diagnostic categories (ICNARC) varied from 29% for poisoning to 67% for neurological patients. Mortality associated with an initial SOFA >11 was lowest for those patients 18 to 20 years old (37%) and highest for those >80 years old (75%). Mortality exceeded 90% when the initial SOFA was >20. However, only 0.2% of patients had an initial SOFA >20.Conclusions A SOFA score >11 was not associated with a hospital mortality >90% at any time during the ICU stay. Age and diagnostic category represent potential modifying factors in the association of SOFA >11 and hospital mortality. Only a small proportion of patients have the extreme initial SOFA values associated with a hospital mortality >90%, limiting the usefulness of SOFA as a triage instrument for pandemic planning.Reference 1.

Failure mode and eff ect analysis in interhospital transport of critically ill patients: a tool to design checklists for handovers in the mobile intensive care unit E Van Lieshout, A Hamming, D Dongelmans, S Smorenburg Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P478 (doi: 10.1186/cc8710) Introduction The complex interhospital transport of critically ill patients bears multiple risks for patient safety, including handovers and reliance on mobile medical equipment. The hypothesis of the present study was that multiple handovers of both equipment and patients in critical care transport would demonstrate omissions and a failure mode and eff ect analysis (FMEA) would unravel its safety priorities. Methods FMEA of the process of interhospital ground critical care transport in the Amsterdam region was performed by three clinical experts to estimate failures in handovers of patients and equipment.Deviations of the optimal process were documented by observations of 16 transports. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the multiple handovers of these transports by the escorting critical care registered nurses and intensivists and included attitude evaluation towards future structured checklists.ResultsThe FMEA revealed that the highest risk priority numbers (above 45) were all related to the medical equipment control before start of transport. During transport observations the most frequent deviations in the process were related to omission of the defi brillator equipment check before transport (in nine out of 16 transports, 56%), handover of medication dose (25 of 39 syringe pumps, 64%) and location of infusion lines (39 of 54 lines, 72%). Nurses and intensivists demonstrated a positive attitude towards implementing handover checklists to improve the quality of the transport (29 of 34 respondents, 85%).Conclusions FMEA seems an applicable tool for risk assessment in critical care. The safety of interhospital critical care transport seems to be suboptimal by lack of standardized handovers. The check of medical equipment should have the highest priority in the optimization of safety in critical care transport. Handovers of information in critical care transport could possibly benefi t from checklists.",

B Jung, N Clavieras, G Chanques, M Cisse, S Jaber Montpellier University Hospital, Montpellier, France Critical Care 2010, 14(Suppl 1):P485 (doi: 10.1186/cc8717)Introduction Etomidate is well tolerated and not inferior to ketamine but because it is implicated in critical illness-related corticosteroid insuffi ciency (CIRCI)[1], its utilization in septic shock patients is controversial. In our ICU, the standard of care is to treat every septic shock patient with 200 mg hydrocortisone for at least 5 days. The aim of our study was to compare prognosis of septic shock patients intubated with etomidate with patients intubated without etomidate. Methods Observational study during a 2-year period including every septic shock patient. We compared the patients' prognosis when intubated with etomidate (E group) to patients intubated without (NE group). We recorded demographic characteristics, results of a cosyntropin test, dose and length of vasopressors and hydrocortisone and outcome. The main endpoint was mortality in the ICU. The secondary endpoints were the length of shock, the dose of vasopressors and hydrocortisone in the ICU and the plasma cortisol level.Results  We evaluated 62 patients in the E group and 31 in the NE group. Although SAPS II on admission was higher in the E group (54 (42 to 64) vs to day 5 was not diff erent between groups. However, the cosyntropin responder rate was higher in the non-E group (40% vs 18%*), hydrocortisone treatment duration (168 hours (78 to 216) vs 96 hours (72 to 144)*) and total dose of hydrocortisone (1,200 mg (500 to 1,625) vs 750 mg (350 to 1,125)*) was higher in the E group than in the non-E group. Finally, mortality in the ICU was not diff erent between groups (32% vs 27% in the E and the non-E groups, respectively). *P <0.05. Conclusions In this study on septic shock treated with a short course of hydrocortisone, patients intubated with etomidate presented a CIRCI more frequently than patients intubated with another drug and needed a longer and higher dose of hydrocortisone treatment. However, length of shock, dose and duration of vasopressors and mortality were not diff erent between groups. Etomidate-induced CIRCI when treated with hydrocortisone was not associated with a poorer outcome in our study. A comparison between etomidate and ketamine should be performed in this population.Reference 1. Jabre et al.: Lancet 2009, 374:293-300.

Participants were invited to complete the 15-minute questionnaire. Email reminders were sent to all members every 2 weeks. After 6 months a reminder email was sent to pharmacists in institutions that had not responded. Questions were split into four categories: pharmacist and ICU-specifi c data; current sedation practice; sedative choice; and analgesic choice. Results The response rate was 68%. Eighty-four per cent of respondents were senior pharmacists and 54% provided a service within a team. The median number of annual ICU admissions was 750 (IQR 635 to 865) and included a wide-ranging case mix. Forty-nine per cent of ICUs had a sedation policy, of which 76% included sedation holds and 87% used a sedation scoring system. Forty-three per cent assessed for delirium, but only 29% used a known delirium scoring system. Ninety-nine of the respondents used propofol (PPF) in the majority of patients, 56 midazolam (MDZ). Twenty-seven still used MDZ routinely in renal or hepatic failure, while 75 used MDZ where sedation was challenging. Fifty-fi ve used morphine, 37 fentanyl and 33 alfentanil as fi rst-line opiate.Conclusions These data suggest that many ICUs do not routinely use sedation policies or assess patients for delirium. While PPF remains the fi rst-line sedative for most ventilated patients, MDZ and morphine are still widely used despite evidence of prolonged eff ects in the presence of hepatic and renal failure.Introduction This study aims to compare the effi cacy of midazolam or propofol in severe refractory AWS, to detail characteristics of patients and to test the usefulness of diff erent scores (MELD, Child, APACHE II) in severe AWS. Methods Patients admitted to the ICU during a 3-year period for refractory AWS after a failed treatment with benzodiazepines according to a symptom-triggered protocol in the general ward or emergency room were treated with neuroleptics and either midazolam or propofol infusion. Processes that could lead to a confounding delirium were excluded. We retrospectively analysed this cohort of patients. Results Fifty patients were reviewed, 85.7% men. Mean age was 49 years. Thirty percent had been previously admitted to the ICU for the same reason. Main reason for alcohol withdrawal was abdominal pain (12.2%). Mean alcohol ingestion was 150 g/day. Mean CHILD/MELD/APACHE score was 6/8.5/13 (24.5% patients had a Child score \u22657). Seventy-three percent of patients developed complications (especially respiratory infections in 19 patients). The most frequent agent found was MSSA and Gram-negative bacilli. Seizures accounted for 38% of patients and hepatic encephalopathy in two. We found no relationship between CHILD or MELD score and rate of intubation, length of stay or complications. Patients with APACHE II >12 at admission had a signifi cant increase in risk of intubation (OR 31.2, P <0.001). Patients with more than 12 days of stay had a signifi cant risk of intubation (OR 49.7, P <0.0001). Thirty-fi ve patients received propofol as the fi rst intravenous sedation and 14 midazolam. Only two patients with midazolam required a second intravenous sedation. Conversely, nine (26.47%) patients initially with propofol required a second sedation with midazolam. The propofol group showed a signifi cant increase in incidence of seizures (41.17% vs 21% in midazolam group) and infections (47.1% vs 28%) independent of APACHE score. These fi ndings were more remarkable in the subgroup that needed a second intravenous sedation (66% seizures and 77% infection rate). This group had higher APACHE score and was associated with a greater likelihood of intubation and a signifi cant 2-day increase in length of stay.",

The NRS-V had the lowest failure rate (9%) compared with NRS-O (17%), VDS (22%), VAS-H (32%) and VAS-V (34%). Validity was measured in the 56 patients who were able to use the fi ve scales both at T1 and T2. The pain intensity measured with the fi ve scales changed signifi cantly between T1 and T2 (P <0.01), showing a good discriminative validity. The correlation between the fi ve scales was important (Spearman's coeffi cients ranged from 0.75 to 0.96, P <0.001). The responsiveness was very good for each of the fi ve scales, either after an analgesia and a nociceptive procedure (eff ect size >0.8).

Conclusions In comparison with H2RA, PPI is more eff ective in the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding (SUB) in patients in intensive care. There is no signifi cant diff erence in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia and mortality between the two groups. Because the randomized controlled trials are few and these fi ndings are based on a small number of patients, fi rm conclusions cannot presently be proposed.

The fall in APC usage over time refl ects uncertainty over its risk-benefi t profi le. Introduction Soluble thrombomodulin is a promising therapeutic natural anticoagulant that is comparable with antithrombin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor and activated protein C. Recently, a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin, composed of the active, extracellular domain of thrombomodulin, has become commercially available for patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, its eff ect on adhesion molecule or plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in patients with DIC is not clear. To elucidate the possible eff ect of a soluble thrombomodulin on endothelial cell and neutrophil interaction in DIC, we investigated the effi cacy of a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin against not only soluble fi brin (SF) for the sensitive marker of DIC, but also soluble E-selectin (sES) and PAI-1 in patients with DIC. Methods We studied 33 patients with DIC associated with sepsis. DIC was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria established by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. Seventeen of 33 patients (RTM group) were assigned a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin for 6 consecutive days. SF, sES, and PAI-1 were measured at day 0 (before treatment), and day 7. DIC resolution rate, clinical course of bleeding symptoms, and survival rates at 90 days were evaluated. Data were subjected to Mann-Whitney U test, Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test (P <0.05 being considered statistically signifi cant).",

The Barthel Index is a simple index of independence to score the ability of a patient to care for itself. It measures the patient's daily functioning, specifi cally the activities of daily living (ADL) and mobility [2] . The objectives of the present study were to assess the ADL of ICU patients at discharge to the ward, and to identify explanatory factors of functional status. Methods A prospective, observational, cohort study was conducted with patients who stayed in a six-bed mixed (predominantly medical) ICU for longer than 48 hours. We used the Danish-language version of the Barthel-20 Index, which is a validated and reliable generic instrument, to measure ADL. The Barthel Index measures the capacity to perform 10 basic ADL and gives a quantitative estimation of the patient's level of dependency, with scoring from 0 (totally dependent) to 20 (totally independent). All assessments were carried out by critical care nurses with an experienced physiotherapist. Patient characteristics and outcome measures were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The data are expressed as medians and interquartile ranges. Results At discharge from the ICU, functional status (as primary outcome) was assessed in 73 patients. The overall functional status was poor (median Barthel Index 2; 0 to 9). In their ability to perform basic ADL, 63% were severely dependent, 25% were moderately dependent, and 10% were slightly dependent on other people. The transfer from bed to wheelchair and return with major help was the ADL component that was noted in the great majority of the patients. Duration of mechanical ventilation (median 5 days; 1 to 12 days) was associated with poorer functional status at ICU discharge. Conclusions This study provides information that is important for the planning of rehabilitation of patients at ICU discharge. After transfer to the ward, the physical resilience of critically ill patients is severely limited. This implies that prior assessment of any care needed after discharge from the ICU is very important. References published works, remains the bias related to patients admitted from other wards or after a prolonged emergency room stay.",

The objective of this study was to conduct a process (quality improvement) and outcome (pre and post implementation) surveillance, HCAI being taken as the major variable. Methods This was a prospective observational study carried out from June 2005 to September 2009. Process implementation was started from May 2006 and included compliance with hand hygiene, urinary catheter care, central line care and VAP bundle. HCAI rates were recorded prospectively every month from June 2005. We recorded the rates of central line-related bloodstream infection (CLI), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) per 1,000 device-days as per CDC-NNIS defi nition [1, 2] . Results Various infection rates showed numerical improvement after the implementation of the quality improvement (QI) process ( Figure 1 ). The diff erences were statistically signifi cant for two of these four endpoints (P for HAP = 0.029 and for UTI = 0.013) and in others there was a trend towards improvement. Device utilization rates associated with these endpoints before and after the implementation remained unchanged, confi rming that the drop of infection rates was not infl uenced by any reduction/increase of respective device utilizations ( Figure 1 ). The average compliance rate during the study period for hand hygiene was 77.92, for urinary catheter care 98.24, for central line care 96.62 and for VAP bundle 91.54. Conclusions Implementation and continuous surveillance of the QI process improved nosocomial HCAI in our hospital. Introduction Evidence shows that anaesthesia and intensive care is a stressful occupation and it may have an impact on anaesthetists' and intensive care doctors' well-being. The goal of the study was to evaluate stress and fatigue and their correlation with working conditions among anaesthesiologists and intensive care specialists employed in Kaunas city (Lithuania) hospitals. Methods One hundred and forty-two doctors of anaesthesia and intensive care departments were interviewed using a standard questionnaire in 2008. It consisted of three parts: the fi rst part covered the demographic and social situation, second -stress experienced during work, third -risk of fatigue. Results The response rate was 71%. Average age of respondents was 41 years, 66.2% were female. A total of 25.4% had working experience <5 years and 23.2% working experience of 11 to 15 years. The workload of 49.3% of respondents was 37 to 54 hours per week (mean number of on-call nights per month -6.5; 15.3% of respondents had >9 on-call night shifts). Often and very often stress was experienced by 24.6% of doctors; symptoms of fatigue were demonstrated by 57% of respondents. Respondents older than 55 years emphasized increased blood pressure, while younger respondents -up to 34 years -reported inability to concentrate, decreased objectiveness, unstable mood, diffi culty in making decisions. Respondents living without partners experienced chest pain, anger and nuisance. Doctors experience less stress if they are satisfi ed with their work and if their workload is adequate, while increasing pressure by hospital administration to decrease costs of care increased risk of fatigue. If a doctor is employed for more 40 hours per week he faces diffi culties concentrating, while more than 60 hours per week causes interference with home life. Conclusions Every fourth anaesthesiologist experienced stress during work, while more than one-half had symptoms of moderate fatigue. Growing workload increased doctor's stress. Pressure by hospital administration and limited freedom in decisions increased incidence of fatigue. Work satisfaction reduced risk of stress and fatigue. Stress and fatigue signifi cantly correlated with the state of physical health.",

Our ITU welcomes the timely referral of at-risk patients. However, excessive numbers of poor referrals have contributed to the prolonged absence of critical care team members from the unit. At a time of increasing diffi culty in maintaining adequate levels of medical cover because of regulations concerning hours of work and training requirements, there is concern that this may adversely aff ect the effi cient and safe management of the ITU. Methods All referrals were prospectively recorded for a 6-week period. The following data were recorded: date/time of referral, grade/specialty of the referring doctor, involvement of the referring consultant, indication for the referral, referral to assessment time, duration of the assessment and whether the referral led to admission. Results Fifty-seven per cent of referrals were out of working hours. The sources of the referrals were as follows: emergency codes 29% and specialty referrals 71%. The admission rates to the ITU for the referrals were cardiac arrests 33%, trauma calls 75%, specialty referrals 42%. Referral rates according to grade (excluding emergency codes): consultant 14%, senior trainee 49%, junior trainee 37%. Admission rates according to grade of referral: consultant 54.6%, senior trainee 42.1%, junior trainee 34.4%. The mean time to review of referral was 20.2 minutes. The mean time for assessment for all referrals was 38.8 minutes. This was 52.3 and 28.9 minutes for patients admitted to the ITU and not admitted, respectively. The mean assessment and management times for the code calls were: cardiac arrest 42 minutes and trauma calls 81.2 minutes. Conclusions Our data suggest that consultant-to-consultant referral would reduce ITU referrals that do not require admission, and decrease the time that ITU trainees are off the unit. Reference Introduction Transferring critically ill patients between clinical areas is recognised to be potentially hazardous [1] and associated with poor outcome [2] . This study addresses the standard of intrahospital transfer of sick patients within our Trust including monitoring, equipment availability, personnel and training. Methods We surveyed senior ward staff on how they would conduct the theoretical transfer of a deteriorating, hypoxic, shocked patient to the ITU. Monitoring and equipment deemed necessary and its perceived availability were recorded, as was transfer personnel. We then prospectively reviewed actual transfers of patients with Early Warning Scores (EWS) of 3 or greater. Results Theoretical transfer data were collected from 19 wards. Most (74%) requested oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) monitoring, while less than one-third wanted either non-invasive blood pressure or ECG monitoring. Some wards expressed a need to borrow equipment, while others felt this would lead to delay. Three wards considered any monitoring unnecessary. Of 13 wards declining a defi brillator/cardiac monitor, two did so due to lack of familiarity. Prospective data were gathered from 32 transfers between September and November 2009. EWS ranged from 3 to 9. The actual transfer monitoring mirrored the initial survey, but for SpO 2 monitoring (44% vs 74%, respectively). A doctor was included by 10% for the theoretical transfer and in 16% of actual transfers. Less than one-half of actual transfers had a trained member of the transfer team. These patients were better monitored but the standard of transfers did not correspond to EWS. Patients with higher EWS were neither better monitored nor accompanied. Out of hours activity comprised 21% of actual transfers. The bulk of patients were from the admission units and the majority went to critical care or radiology. Conclusions There is considerable movement of sick patients around the hospital. Many transfers are performed by untrained staff , without adequate monitoring, and many are out of hours. There is poor understanding of risks of transfer and of appropriate monitoring. The data suggest that defi cits are due partly to equipment unavailability -we are conducting a further audit to determine this. We propose additional investment and training and are compiling intrahospital transfer guidelines according to EWS.

The duration of mechanical ventilation was similar (2 days in both groups). However, the ICU length of stay (LOS) was reduced by a day after implementation (3 days vs 2 days). Amongst patients who survived and who were mechanically ventilated for more than 4 days, the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU LOS were reduced (7 days vs 6 days and 8 days vs 6 days, respectively). Fewer CT brains were performed for persistent coma after discontinuation of sedation in the intervention period (4.5% vs 1.2%). Complications such as extubation failure, tracheostomy and inadvertent removal of devices were similar in both groups. Conclusions A nurse-driven sedation protocol is safe and may reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU LOS, especially amongst patients who have been ventilated for more than 4 days. Introduction We aimed to select the sedative drug with the least impact on hepatic blood fl ow in sedation-administered patients. In our study, we aimed to establish whether or not midazolam and propofol aff ect liver function during sepsis. The hepatic blood fl ow is evaluated by the transcutaneous assessment of the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate (ICG-PDR) in critically ill patients. Methods Forty sepsis patients were included in the study with either the loading dose infusion of propofol 1 mg/kg over 15 minutes followed by a maintenance 1 to 3 mg/kg/hour (n = 20, Group P) or a loading dose of midazolam 0.2 mg/kg over 10 minutes followed by a maintenance 0.04 to 0.06 mg/kg/hour (n = 20, Group M), 24 hours infusion. ICG elimination tests were conducted concurrently using the non-invasive liver function monitoring system (LiMON). A dose of 0.3 mg/kg ICG was given through a cubital fossa vein as a bolus and immediately fl ushed with 10 ml normal saline. We calculated ICG-PDR. The ICG-PDR measurements were obtained at baseline (before start of the propofol or midazolam infusion) and were repeated at 24 hours. Biochemical and hemodynamic parameters, ICG-PDR were recorded before start of the study and at 24 hours. Results Biochemical and hemodynamic parameters did not diff er signifi cantly between the groups (P <0.05). Group P compared with Group M; baseline ICG-PDR levels (23.67 \u00b1 12.02 vs 23.86 \u00b1 11.4, respectively), and after the study ICG-PDR levels (26.04 \u00b1 13.60 vs 24.07 \u00b1 9.07) did not diff er in groups (P >0.05). When we examined before and after ICG-PRD changes between groups, there was no signifi cant diff erence (P >0.05).Conclusions In our study, we found that neither propofol nor midazolam infusion aff ected hepatic blood fl ow. Methods In 20 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats, endotoxic shock was induced by infusion of LPS (10 mg/kg over 30 minutes). When the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was decreased to 40 mmHg, fl uid resuscitation was started in three groups of fi ve rats each, and in one fi ve-rat group no fl uids were given. Renal cortical microvascular perfusion (RMP) was assessed at high temporal and spatial resolution using laser speckle imaging. Additional measurements included systemic hemodynamics, renal artery blood fl ow (RBF), blood gas analysis, creatinine clearance, and plasma ions and calculated renal oxygen delivery (DO 2 ). Time points were: baseline, during septic shock at a MAP of 40 mmHg, and at 30 minutes of resuscitation.Results LPS infusion decreased MAP and RMP in all rats. Resuscitation with NaCl did not improve MAP (P >0.05) and appeared to increase RMP heterogeneity (0.95 \u00b1 0.08 AU vs 1.83 \u00b1 0.13 AU; P <0.001), metabolic acidosis (7.1 \u00b1 0.06 vs 6.93 \u00b1 0.05 pH; P <0.05 and 11.36 \u00b1 1.1 vs 15.9 \u00b1 1.4 mmol/l base excess; P <0.05), and plasma chloride ion levels (110.3 \u00b1 0.7 vs 116.2 \u00b1 1.7 mmol/l; P <0.05). Fluid resuscitation did not aff ect systemic oxygenation parameters (sO 2 , pO 2 , O 2 Hb) and renal DO 2 . Resuscitation with NaCl increased plasma levels of Na + , tubular reabsorption of Na + , and creatinine clearance compared with resuscitation with the two colloid solutions. HES-NaCl and HES-RA provided similar eff ects on systemic and regional hemodynamic parameters. However, while HES-RA improved RBF (2.3 \u00b1 0.4 vs 5.7 \u00b1 0.2), HES-NaCl did not. NaCl resuscitation worsened the metabolic acidosis, which was not aff ected by the two colloid solutions. The plasma HCO 3 level was increased by HES-RA resuscitation (13.18 \u00b1 2.1 vs 19.56 \u00b1 1 mmol/l; P <0.01), whereas it was stable in the other groups. Conclusions Balanced HES preparation (HES-RA, PlasmaVolume Redibag\u00ae) in endotoxemic rats showed acute benefi cial eff ects on kidney microcirculation and on kidney function via bicarbonate balance whereas the NaCl treatment was harmful compared with both HES groups. Methods In 22 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated rats, hemorrhagic shock was induced by withdrawing blood volume from the femoral artery until the mean arterial pressure (MAP mmHg) was reduced to 40 mmHg. One hour after reaching a MAP of 40 mmHg, animals were resuscitated with either Voluven\u00ae (n = 5), PVR (n = 6), RA (n = 5), or NaCl (n = 6) until a target MAP of 80 mmHg was reached. Oxygen tension in the renal cortex (C\u03bcPO 2 mmHg), outer medulla (M\u03bcPO 2 mmHg), and renal vein were measured using oxygen-dependent quenched phosphorescent lifetimes of Oxyphor G2. Renal artery blood fl ow (RBF ml/minute) was measured. Renal oxygen delivery and renal oxygen consumption (DO 2 and VO 2 ml\u00b7minute/g) were calculated. Results During hemorrhagic shock, C\u03bcPO 2 , M\u03bcPO 2 , RBF, DO 2 , and VO 2 decreased and O 2 ER increased. During resuscitation, C\u03bcPO 2 and M\u03bcPO 2 were increased in all groups (P <0.001) although least prominent in the NaCl group. RBF was signifi cantly increased during resuscitation in all groups (PVR; 5.1 \u00b1 0.2 P <0.001, RA; 3.5 \u00b1 0.4 P <0.001, Voluven\u00ae; 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 P <0.01), except for the NaCl group, and DO 2 was signifi cantly increased in the PVR group (0.20 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.39 \u00b1 0.06; P <0.01) and RA group (0.22 \u00b1 0.03 vs 0.41 \u00b1 0.06; P <0.01), while this remained low in the other two groups. Fluid resuscitation was not able to restore VO 2 . After 1 hour of resuscitation C\u03bcPO 2 was signifi cantly higher in the PVR group (49.9 \u00b1 2.4 P <0.01) and the Voluven\u00ae group (45.3 \u00b1 5.1 P <0.05) but not in the RA group (40.6 \u00b1 2.2 P >0.05) compared with the NaCl group (32.1 \u00b1 2.55). Furthermore, RBF was signifi cantly higher in the PVR group (5.1 \u00b1 0.2 P <0.01) compared with the NaCl group (2.4 \u00b1 0.5) after 1 hour of resuscitation. Conclusions Our results suggest that both colloid solutions (Voluven\u00ae and PlasmaVolume Redibag\u00ae) are preferred resuscitation fl uids with respect to crystalloid solutions. Moreover, the balanced colloid solution (PVR) appears to restore renal blood fl ow and oxygenation more than the crystalloids or unbalanced colloids do in this rat model of hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.there was no signifi cant change in serum pH and HCO 3 levels. All changes were in the physiological range (Table 1) . Conclusions All three crystalloid solutions can be safely used for dehydrated patients and the best metabolic profi le can be maintained in patients who receive Isolyte\u00ae. Introduction Septic shock is frequently associated with metabolic acidosis derived from increased lactic acid production and infusion of sodium chloride-based resuscitation fl uids. Although the impact of hyperchloraemic acidosis on outcome is still not fully understood, avoiding such a condition is desirable. The hypothesis of the present study was that resuscitation with saline-based tetrastarch solutions results in higher plasma chloride and lower base excess levels as compared with either balanced tetrastarch or crystalloid solutions in ovine endotoxaemic shock. Methods Thirty-one awake healthy ewes received a continuous infusion of Salmonella typhosa endotoxin started at 5 ng/kg/minute, which was doubled every hour until the mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell below 65 mmHg. Thereafter, sheep were randomized to receive either balanced 6% HES 130/0.4; saline-based 6% HES 130/0.4 (both HES solutions were infused up to 50 ml/kg); balanced crystalloids; or no fl uids. Fluid resuscitation was guided to optimize central venous pressure (8 to 12 mmHg), pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (12 to 15 mmHg) and mixed-venous oxygen saturation (\u226565%). Norepinephrine was infused to establish a MAP of 70 \u00b1 5 mmHg, if necessary. Haemodynamic variables and blood gas analyses were determined hourly throughout the study period. Animals surviving the 12-hour intervention period were deeply anaesthetized and killed. Results Haemodynamic variables were comparable between groups. Plasma chloride concentrations were signifi cantly higher, and oximetrycorrected base excess was lower in the saline-based tetrastarch group as compared with the balanced tetrastarch or balanced crystalloid group over the whole interventional period (each P <0.05). Whereas arterial pCO 2 was lowest in the saline-based tetrastarch group (each P <0.05), there were no diff erences between treatment groups in arterial pH. Conclusions As compared with balanced tetrastarch or crystalloid solutions, saline-based tetrastarch infusion is associated with hyperchloraemic acidosis, which is compensated by hyperventilation in awake, endotoxaemic sheep. Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication associated with increased mortality among ICU patients. The purpose of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the infl uence of diff erent, saline-based hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions (tetrastarch, 6% HES 130/0.4; pentastarch, 10% HES 200/0.5) on the risk of AKI in a cohort of surgical ICU patients. Methods Data for 3,591 patients admitted to one of four ICUs of the University Hospital of Muenster from January 2000 until August 2008 were extracted from an electronic database and analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. AKI was defi ned as grade I or higher according to the RIFLE classifi cation. Results Average amounts of colloid infusion per ICU day were 402 (231; 656) and 73 (36; 172) ml/day in patients treated with tetrastarch and pentastarch, respectively, whereas cumulative colloid amounts were 2,000 (500; 3,500) ml and 1,000 (500; 2,000) ml. Maximum daily infusion rates of 6% HES 130/0.4 and 10% HES 200/0.5 were below the pharmaceutically recommended daily dose limitations (that is, 50 and 20 ml/kg/day, respec tively). The overall incidence of AKI was 20.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed SOFA score (OR 1.597; 95% CI 1.543, 1.653), male gender (OR 1.455; 95% CI 1.153, 1.836), creatinine concentration on admission (OR 1.288; 95% CI 1.125, 1.475), and patient age (OR 1.017; 95% CI 1.009, 1.024) as independent risk factors for AKI. See Figure 1 . Conclusions Neither of the investigated HES solutions (given within the recommended dose range) was an independent risk factor for AKI in the present cohort of surgical ICU patients. Introduction Liver failure is often complicated by sepsis. Available liver support systems (LSS) failed to show survival benefi ts. Hepa Wash\u00ae (HW) is a newly developed LSS based on use of recycled albumin dialysate. The study aim is to evaluate its safety and effi cacy in an animal model that combines liver failure with sepsis. Methods Female German Landrace pigs (~60 kg) were randomly allocated to HW (n = 5) and control (n = 5) groups. On day 0 ischemic and cholestatic liver injury was induced by functional end-to-side portacaval shunt and bile duct ligation. Animals were returned then to the stall for observation. On day 3 the second phase of the experiment was started. Endotoxin was administered intravenously at an initial dose of 4 \u03bcg/kg/hour with a stepwise twofold increment every hour and stopped after 7.5 hours. HW was started 2.5 hours after endotoxemia and continued for 7 hours. Results On day 3, animals (n = 10) had hyperbilirubinemia (5.2 \u00b1 0.3 mg/dl; mean \u00b1 SEM) and hyperammonemia (264 \u00b1 38 \u03bcg/dl). Endotoxemia in control animals resulted in severe multisystem organ failure and death (after 6.4 \u00b1 0.3 hours) although they received only one-third of the total endotoxin dose on average. HW improved cardiovascular ( Figure 1 ), cerebral, respiratory and renal parameters and eliminated surrogate parameters as bilirubin (2.8 \u00b1 0.5 vs 5.2 \u00b1 0.3 mg/dl P <0.05) and ammonia (189 \u00b1 38 vs 1,108 \u00b1 455 \u03bcg/dl, P <0.05). All animals in the HW group survived the 10-hour observation period (P <0.05). We did not notice any adverse eff ects during treatment. Conclusions Hepa Wash\u00ae was safe and eff ective at improving survival in a swine model of liver failure and sepsis due to amelioration of the major organ functions and removal of protein-bound and water-soluble toxins.

Increased GFR may in theory lead to subtherapeutic concentrations of life-saving drugs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence rate and pattern of increased GFR in critically ill patients receiving anti-infective treatment (AIT). Methods Prospective evaluation of consecutive ICU patients during a 6-week period, treated with anti-infective drugs, either therapeutically or prophylactically; dialysed patients were excluded. Patient characteristics: retrieved from the computerized Intensive Care Information System. Surrogate measure for GFR: the 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance (Ccr) calculated per day of AIT. Increased GFR: Ccr >120 ml/minute. Statistical analysis with SPSS 17.0: Student's t test, chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Data expression: median and interquartile range (IQR). Multivariate analysis: logistic regression analysis with increased GFR as dependent variable. Results One hundred and forty-one (94 male) patients were included; median age was 59.9 (50.3 to 70.1); 80 (56.7%) were surgical ICU (SICU) patients. Most common infection types were pneumonia (59.2%) and intra-abdominal infection (9.9%). Prophylactic use was 17.6% of all AIT. Median length of stay 4.6 days; ICU mortality 5.7%. Median Ccr in the whole patient group was 97.0 ml/minute (57.5 to 164.5). In total, 753 AIT days were available for analysis in which 302 days of increased GFR were present (40.1%). Seventy-six patients (53.9%) had an episode of increased GFR at some time during AIT. In 31 patients (22.0%) GFR was increased throughout the whole episode of AIT. Patients with increased GFR were signifi cantly younger (54.2 vs 65.6, P <0.001) and there was a trend towards a higher incidence of increased GFR in patients treated for infections, in male and in SICU patients. Multivariate analysis showed that age (OR 0.93 per year), therapeutic administration of AIT (OR 5.49), and SICU admission (OR 2.27) were independently associated with increased GFR. Conclusions Increased GFR were a frequent fi nding in critically ill patients receiving AIT, and was associated with younger age and SICU admission. Results Fourteen patients (male/female, 4/10, median age 8.5 years) underwent a total of 37 TPE sessions. Acute liver failure was induced by viral hepatitis in fi ve cases, Wilson disease in four cases, toxins in four cases and autoimmune hepatitis in one case. When compared with baseline, there were signifi cant improvements in laboratory parameters ( Table 1 ). Five of the 14 patients (35.7%) died in the pediatric ICU, fi ve patients underwent liver transplantation. Four patients (28.5%) survived with extracorporeal liver support. No serious adverse eff ect of TPE was observed in the patients during or after completion of TPE. Conclusions TPE is eff ective in improving liver biochemistry tests in children with liver failure. Expected changes in laboratory parameters after TPE must be considered especially in deciding for liver transplantation. Reference ",

The patients who received broad-spectrum antibiotics and no contraindication to enteral feeding were enrolled into two arms after informed consent. Allocation to intervention was randomized individually to receive fi ber diet or nonfi ber diet up to 14 days. Demographic data, disease severity, nutritional delivery and diarrhea score were recorded each day. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed after completed study.Results Thirty-four patients were enrolled in the study (17 patients each in the fi ber group and the nonfi ber group). These two patient groups were similar in demographics, disease severity, nutritional status, cause of sepsis and total feeding per day. Although the proportion of patients who confronted with diarrhea score >15 was higher in the nonfi ber group than the fi ber group, these did not show statistical diff erence signifi cantly (8/17 patients (47.06%) vs 4/17 patients (23.53%); P = 0.15). However; the group of the fi ber diet had a lower mean diarrhea score (fi ber vs nonfi ber = 3.6 \u00b1 2.3 vs 6.3 \u00b1 3.6; P = 0.005) and the generalized estimation equation model for repeated measurement (GEE) revealed a lower global diarrhea score in the fi ber group than the nonfi ber group about 3.03 (coeffi cient -3.03 (95% CI = -5.03 to -0.92); P = 0.005). Cox proportional hazard ratio of fi ber group was 0.45 (95% CI = 0.13 to 1.49; P = 0.19) but no statistical diff erence. Conclusions Enteral nutrition with a fi ber diet formula could reduce the diarrhea score in surgical critically ill septic patients who received broadspectrum antibiotics.

The hematologic data -hemoglobin, total WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and platelet count -were taken before and after completion of the prescribed radiation dose. The results were analyzed using either paired or independent-samples t test.Results In the study group the blood indices were higher compared with the control group at the end of radiation therapy: hemoglobin in gm% (12.8 >11.8, P = 0.002), total WBC (7,276 >4,877, P = 0.0005), and neutrophil count (5,363 >3,315, P = 0.0007).

Mechanisms leading to SAD are unclear, therapy and prophylaxis unsatisfactory. Infl ammation and its eff ects on the brain may play an important role. We hypothesized that n-3 fatty acids will have a benefi cial eff ect on systemic infl ammation and hence cerebral markers in sepsis. In agreement with earlier data, patients with SAD had higher values for S-100\u03b2 (P = 0.019) [1] . AUC for S-100\u03b2 was 2.73 \u00b1 2.89 vs 0.95 \u00b1 0.74 (P = 0.14) for patients receiving supplemental n-3 fatty acids and controls, respectively. While none of the diff erences reached signifi cance, IL-6 and IL-8 declined more rapidly in the n-3 fatty acid-treated group whereas cerebral markers showed an opposite trend. The number of patients with SAD and the duration of SAD were not diff erent in both groups. Conclusions Interpretation of the results is hampered by unevenly distributed baseline characteristics and more patients need to be investigated. In this small sample no benefi cial eff ect of n-3 fatty acids on cerebral markers was found. Introduction Targeting glycemia to age-adjusted normal fasting blood glucose levels with intensive insulin therapy (IIT) improved short-term outcome of critically ill children as compared with conventional insulin therapy (CIT), but concomitantly increased the incidence of hypoglycemia [1] . Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia may adversely aff ect the developing brain of young children. We therefore studied the impact of targeting normoglycemia with IIT on circulating markers of brain injury in these patients. Methods This was a pre-planned analysis of all 700 pediatric critically ill patients included in a prospective, randomized, controlled study on IIT [1] . Patients were randomly assigned to the target of normal for age fasting blood glucose levels (2.8 to 4.4 mmol/l for age <1 year and 3.9 to 5.6 mmol/l for age \u22651 year) with insulin infusion throughout the ICU stay (IIT), or to insulin infusion only to prevent excessive hyperglycemia (CIT). Serum S100B and neuron-specifi c enolase (NSE), markers of astrocytic and neuronal damage, were measured by ELISA on fi xed days (n = 700) and before and after hypoglycemia in a nested case-control design (n = 126).",

Admission levels of S100B and NSE were higher in patients needing intensive care for at least 3 days vs short-stay patients (both P <0.0001) and in ICU nonsurvivors vs survivors (P = 0.002 and P = 0.0002). IIT did not aff ect the levels of S100B or NSE as compared with CIT. Patients experiencing hypoglycemia at any time during the ICU stay revealed higher S100B and NSE levels on admission (P <0.0001 and P = 0.0007) than those without hypoglycemia. In the nested case-control study, S100B and NSE decreased after hypoglycemia (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009) in the cases, unlike in the controls on matched days. Conclusions IIT in the pediatric ICU did not evoke neurological damage, as evaluated by S100B and NSE, despite an increased incidence of brief hypoglycemia. Elevated markers in patients with hypoglycemia were not caused by hypoglycemia but explained by an increased risk of hypoglycemia in the most severely ill. References Changing practice in complex multidisciplinary environments is diffi cult. In addition, it is undecided whether IIT should be applied by nurses and physicians, or nurses alone. We implemented IIT using a conceptual implementation framework and compared overall blood glucose control and incidence of severe hypoglycemia (SH) (blood glucose level (BGL) <40 mg/dl) before and after implementation.Methods Three ICUs developed and implemented an evidence-based guideline for IIT; three ICUs with no change in blood glucose control served as control ICUs. In the guideline ICUs, the IIT practice change comprised two periods: in the fi rst year after implementation of the guideline, physicians and nurses used the guideline together; in the second year the guideline was applied solely by nurses. BGL collection and analysis included the 1 year before implementation of the guideline. Analysis was performed using statistical process control. Results IIT guideline: the new guideline emphasized fast correction of high BGLs, acceptance of low BGLs and frequent BGL measurements (up to one/hour). Blood glucose control: BGLs of approximately 8,000 patients were collected and analyzed. The case mix was similar in guideline and control ICUs, and did not change over time. No change in overall blood glucose control or incidence of SH was observed in the control ICUs during the study duration. In the guideline ICUs, the median number of daily blood glucose measurements increased from 4 (3 to 7) per patient to 9 (5 to 12) per patient (P <0.001). Median morning BGL declined in guideline ICUs, from 114 (96 to 139) mg/dl to 100 (85 to 123) mg/dl (P <0.001).The change in blood glucose control was accompanied by a rise in the incidence of SH, from 7% to 13% (P <0.001). SH, however, did never cause short-term harm (no death or coma). Nurses alone performed equally well with regard to overall blood glucose control, and even showed a decline of incidence of SH.Conclusions Implementation of an evidence-based IIT guideline improves blood glucose control, with results comparable with the original studies on IIT in Leuven. The increase of incidence of SH is temporary, and improves when IIT is applied by nurses alone. Introduction Hypoglycaemia is one of the major side eff ects when establishing glycaemic control in critically ill patients and may contribute to increased mortality rates. Until today, no comparable measure of hypoglycaemia frequency has been suggested. Current assessments depend either on the treatment period or the number of glucose measurements performed per patient. Therefore, we suggest an alternative method to present the hypoglycaemia incidence by number of episodes per patient normalized for a 24-hour treatment period. Conclusions The results reveal that the treatment period may have a signifi cant impact on the reported rate of hypoglycemia. We conclude that reporting hypoglycaemic episodes in critically ill patients on a perpatient and per-24-hour basis may be a more adequate tool to accurately describe hypoglycaemia incidence which facilitates the comparison between diff erent studies and study protocols.

The innovation was a new tight glycemic control (TGC) therapy in the ICU. The implementation method to introduce a new evidence-based treatment to the ICU can make a diff erence to its eff ectiveness. New treatment procedures are very often strictly defi ned and introduced on the ICU in a top-down manner. On theoretical grounds, a bottom-up implementation method, with more participation and involvement of the ICU nurses, should be more eff ective.Methods In an experiment a TGC protocol was introduced on a 24-bed ICU with 120 ICU nurses. In one nursing team the implementation was by means of the usual planned approach (PA). In the other team an emergent implementation approach (EA) was applied. During 7 months, 1,182 patients were admitted and randomly assigned to either team. The eff ectiveness of the implementation methods was measured at patientoutcome (glucose) level and on a process-execution (nurse compliance) level. The patient-outcome measurements were: mean glucose value, percentage of normal glucose values (defi ned as between 4.0 and 6.5 mmol/l) and the time from admission to reach a normal glucose level (6.5 mmol/l). For the mean glucose value a diff erence was made between short-stay (<3 days) and long-stay patients (\u22653 days). The compliance was expressed as compliance for safe, insulin treatment (the patient received the right amount of insulin) and compliance for effi cient treatment (glucose measurements as well as insulin were according to the protocol).",

Introduction A hypercoagulable state is frequently found in sepsis patients as well as hyperglycemia [1] . The objective of this study was to determine the coagulation profi le in hyperglycemic septic shock patients and the impact of glycemia control. Methods Septic shock patients with less than 48 hours of organ dysfunction with normoglycemia (<150 mg/dl, Group 1) or hyperglycemia (>200 mg/dl, Group 2) were included. Exclusion criteria were previous diabetes, coagulation diseases, use of heparin or fresh frozen plasma/ platelets, sepsis in the past 30 days or insulin use in the past 24 hours. The coagulation and infl ammation profi le was determined at inclusion and after 24 hours, only if the patients remained normoglycemic or achieved glycemic control with insulin infusion (Group 2). Results were expressed in median and interquartiles, P <0.05 was considered signifi cant.Results Forty-one patients were included, 59.7% male; mean APACHE II score: 16.9 \u00b1 8.6, P = 0.21; mean SOFA score: 8.1 \u00b1 2.0; mean number of organ dysfunctions: 3.6 \u00b1 0.9, with a signifi cant diff erence between the groups only regarding age (Group 1 (n = 21): 53.8 \u00b1 16.7, Group 2 (n = 20): 68.8 \u00b1 16.4, P = 0.006). In both groups, a hypercoagulation profi le was detected, with high levels of fragment 1+2 (F1+2), thrombin/antithrombin complex (TAT), D-dimer and tissue factor and with low levels of factor VII. Consumption of coagulation inhibitors (protein C (PC), antithrombin (AT), tissue factor pathway inhibitor) and increased fi brinolysis (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and plasminogen) were also found. However, at baseline no signifi cant diff erence between groups was found except for a trend towards high levels of F1+2 (P = 0.08) and TAT (P = 0.058) in Group 2. After 24 hours higher levels of AT (P = 0.02), PC (P = 0.02), plasminogen (P = 0.04) and a reduction in PAI-1 (P = 0.01) and TPA (P = 0.03) were detected in Group 2. Infl ammatory parameters (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF) were similar at baseline, with decreased levels in both groups after 24 hours but the IL-6 (P = 0.02) and IL-8 (P = 0.0004) reduction was more pronounced in Group 2.Conclusions Septic shock patients have a hypercoagulation pattern regardless of their glycemic status. However, glycemia control seems to be associated with reduction in infl ammation and hypercoagulation parameters, possibly related to insulin infusion as glycemia levels did not diff er between groups after 24 hours.

Introduction Several studies have shown an increased mortality and morbidity in various groups of patients with hyperglycemia requiring admission to the ICU. Contrary to these studies, a recent large multicentric international trial in ICU patients has shown an increased mortality in patients where normoglycemia was maintained. However, very few studies specifi cally evaluated the association between hyperglycemia and mortality in critical care patients with sepsis. Since hyperglycemia is known to be associated with immunosuppression and increased risk of life-threatening infections, we aimed to assess the impact of glycemic control (normoglycemia) in ICU patients with sepsis.Methods We studied all patients admitted to our ICU with sepsis between July 2004 and May 2009. Patients were excluded if their blood sugar levels (BSL) were not measured at least once every 6 hours during their ICU stay. Patients were divided into two groups based on their glycemic control in the ICU: normoglycemic group (BSL 3.9 to 6.2 mmol/l) and conventional glucose control group (BSL 8 to 10 mmol/l). BSLs were controlled using an infusion of actrapid insulin. Both groups were compared with regard to demographics, co-morbidities, severity of illness at ICU admission (APACHE III and SAPS II scores), ICU and hospital mortality and length of stay.Results Over the 5-year study period a total of 314 patients were admitted with sepsis and 297 patients were included. On average every patient included in the study had BSL once every 4.2 hours throughout their ICU stay. Of these patients, 68 had normoglycemia (mean BSL 5.6) and 229 had conventional glucose control (mean BSL 8.5) during their ICU stay. There was no statistically signifi cant diff erence between the groups in age, sex, APACHE III and SAPS II scores. The ICU mortality was signifi cantly higher in the normoglycemic group (30.8% vs 14.8% P <0.01). There was no statistically signifi cant diff erence in hospital mortality between both groups (33.8% vs 25.3% P = 0.16). The ICU (median and IQR days: 1 (1 to 3) vs 4 (2 to 7) P = <0.01) and hospital duration of stay (6.0 (2.00 to 13.75) 6.0 (2.00 to 13.75) vs 12.0 (7.00 to 27.00); P <0.01) were signifi cantly higher in the conventional group. Conclusions The ICU mortality in patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis who had normoglycemia was higher than in those patients who had conventional glucose control during their ICU stay. Aiming for a normal blood glucose levels is not indicated in patients with sepsis while they are in the ICU. ",

            "text": "In 2008, the UK National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) published a report following 42 incidents and two deaths where glucosecontaining fl ush solutions were attached to arterial lines. Deaths occurred when blood samples contaminated with the fl ush solution led to artifi cially high blood glucose readings, inappropriate insulin administration and iatrogenic neuroglycopaenia (the molar concentration of 5% glucose at 277 mmol/l is huge next to physiological blood glucose at <11 mmol/l). The NPSA sought a solution so we applied a bench model to test the performance of three open and three closed arterial line systems in preventing sample contamination. Methods All arterial line systems were set up in a standard manner and pressurised to 300 mmHg with 5% glucose used as the fl ush solution. This was connected to the radial artery using an 18 G needle representing the radial cannula. The radial artery was simulated using a wide bore extension set with blood fl ow at 60 ml/minute. Blood was simulated by the addition of red dye to Hartmann's solution. Increasing multiples of arterial line dead space were aspirated and discarded. Blood samples were then taken and the glucose concentration measured. Introduction Glucose variability has been found to be associated with mortality in critically ill patients, independent of the mean glucose concentration [1] . The aim of this analysis was to assess the impact of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on glucose variability in critically ill patients receiving intensive insulin therapy (IIT). Methods This is the post hoc analysis of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial [2] . Data of 124 patients admitted to the ICU either receiving IIT according to a real-time CGM system (Guardian\u00ae; Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) (n = 63) or according to an algorithm (n = 61) with selective arterial blood glucose measurements (simultaneously blinded CGM) for 72 hours were analysed. Insulin infusion rates were guided according to the same algorithm in both groups. Mean glucose and standard deviation, as a marker of glucose variability, were calculated for the fi rst 24 hours (Glu MEAN1 , Glu SD1 ) and for the whole study period (Glu SD ). Statistical comparison of parameters between study groups and between ICU survivors (n = 94) and nonsurvivors (n = 30) was performed using Student's t test. (Figure 1a ). The mean absolute relative diff erence was 6.5%. No signifi cant errors due to drugs were measured. These results compare favorably with a previous study of 50 subjects who were monitored continuously for up to 72 hours in a diabetic in-clinic study (Figure 1b) where large excursions of BG could safely be evaluated.",

As a counterregulatory hormone of insulin, GC may interfere substantially with tight glycaemic control to normal for age blood glucose levels by intensive insulin therapy. Therefore we hypothesized that the fi rst administration of an intravenous GC gives rise to signifi cant hyperglycaemia and that the eff ect is more pronounced for the synthetic GC. Methods All patients admitted to the surgical and paediatric ICU between 1 July 2008 and 1 July 2009 were screened for intravenous glucocorticoid use in our patient data management system. In those patients, arterial blood glucose levels, all measured by blood gas analyzer, within the time frame of 48 hours surrounding the GC administration were retrieved. Up to two baseline blood glucose levels (before GC administration) and up to six blood glucose levels post administration were analysed by repeatedmeasures ANOVA. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or as median (IQR In comparison with the control group (n = 81), patients with hepatic dysfunction (n = 6), pancreatitis (n = 14), severe insulin resistance (n = 2), sepsis (n = 32) and dyslipidemia without statin (n = 7) had signifi cantly higher mean values of TG (all P <0.05). Groups with cirrhosis and ascites (n = 3), diabetes mellitus (n = 11), chronic renal failure (n = 6) and patients with statin before and during hospitalization (n = 42) had similar levels of TG as the control group. Conclusions When guidelines for fat intake in the ICU are followed, modest fat intake does not seem to explain HTG. Our results show that the amount of propofol given (mg/kg/day) and some clinical factors might be correlated with HTG in the ICU. Introduction Vitamin D defi ciency seems increasingly prevalent in the community, and defi ciency has been reported in almost 60% of medical inpatients [1] . Pleiotropic eff ects of vitamin D like immunomodulation and eff ects on muscle strength may be of special importance to critically ill patients. Despite this knowledge, vitamin D defi ciency has only been studied in small and selected groups of ICU patients [2] . Therefore, we prospectively determined the prevalence of vitamin D defi ciency and related vitamin D status to outcome in a cohort of critically ill patients. Introduction Cortisol, which is produced and released by the adrenal gland under the regulation of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), plays a crucial role in the survival mechanisms involved in critical illness. A dissociation between high plasma cortisol and low ACTH in patients has been observed in the more chronic phase of critical illness induced by severe sepsis and multiple trauma [1] . In order to assess the potential confounding impact of errors in the measurement of ACTH, we evaluated the stability of ACTH during sample processing. Methods Two tests were performed. For the fi rst test, two blood samples per patient were taken from 10 randomly selected patients in the surgical ICU. One sample was collected warm (that is, samples were collected at room temperature (RT), left for 60 to 90 minutes at RT followed by 24 hours at 4\u00b0C, centrifuged (10 minutes, 1,000 rpm), and serum was stored at -80\u00b0C), the other sample was collected cold (that is, recommended collection procedure for ACTH detection: samples were collected on ice, centrifuged (10 minutes, 1,000 rpm), and plasma was stored at -80\u00b0C). For a second test, again, two blood samples were taken per patient (n = 10) in the surgical ICU. One sample was kept frozen until ACTH testing (original), whereas the other sample was defrosted several times at RT before analysis (defrosted). ACTH levels were measured using an ACTH RIA kit (BRAHMS) and the diff erent sampling methods and sample treatments were compared using Bland-Altman statistics.",

Moreover, the diff erences in ACTH levels measured between the two collection methods or sample treatments were independent of the amount of ACTH present in the samples.Conclusions We showed that warm collection or frequent defrosting of samples does not induce a clinically signifi cant error in ACTH levels measured, implying that nonideally collected or treated samples can still be used for rough ACTH analysis. Introduction Zinc is a trace element that is required for normal function of many enzymes. Intact zinc homeostasis must be present for normal function of the immune system, oxidative stress responses. We explored the hypothesis that a decline in serum zinc concentrations among critically ill patients is related to mortality, length of stay in the ICU, APACHE II and SOFA scores. Methods This prospective study was conducted in the ICU of the emergency department. All patients (>18 years) admitted to the ICU from September through November 2009 were enrolled into the study. Burn victims, alcoholics, patients with gastrointestinal fi stulas and severe diarrhea were excluded from the study. Patients' demographic characteristics, APACHE and SOFA scores were recorded; blood samples were collected within 24 hours after admission and analyzed for serum zinc, copper, C-reactive protein and albumin levels. Patients were followed up for mortality and length of stay in the ICU for 28 days.Results Thirty-six patients were enrolled during the study period, with median age 70.5 years (18 to 87). The male to female ratio was 1:1.1. Serum zinc levels correlated inversely with SOFA scores (r = -0.41, P = 0.01). Patients with \u22658 SOFA scores had signifi cantly lower serum zinc levels compared with patients with <8 SOFA scores (6.74 \u00b1 1.63 \u03bcmol/l (n = 11) and 9.17 \u00b1 2.76 \u03bcmol/l (n = 25), respectively; P <0.05). There was no signifi cant diff erence between serum zinc levels of patients with <25 and \u226525 APACHE II scores and also there was no signifi cant diff erence between survivors and nonsurvivors. Serum zinc and copper levels had no signifi cant relationship with length of stay in the ICU. Conclusions Serum zinc concentrations correlated inversely with SOFA scores in this study. This result supports that organ failure and critical illness leads to a decline in serum zinc concentrations and that zinc administration may be benefi cial for critically ill patients. ",

            "text": "There are no formal reports of follow-up services in pediatric intensive care settings despite mounting evidence that parents report negative psychological symptoms for many months after a child's admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The aim of this study was to establish the impact of a PICU follow-up clinic on parents' distress. Methods In this prospective, randomised controlled trial, parents of 133 children admitted to an eight-bed PICU for >12 hours were randomly allocated to either the intervention (follow-up clinic appointment off ered 2 months after discharge) or control (no appointment) condition. Parents' baseline stress was assessed at discharge using the Parental Stressor Scale: PICU [1] . Five months later, post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression were assessed by postal questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale [2] and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [3] ).Results Outcome data were obtained for 105 parents. Whole group analyses revealed no signifi cant diff erences in psychological outcome between the control and intervention groups. However, post hoc analyses revealed eff ects in favour of the intervention, for a sub-group of parents (n = 55) who had reported baseline stress scores above median during their child's hospitalisation. Within this sub-group, parents who received the intervention were less likely to report clinically signifi cant levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms (25% vs 56%, P = 0.018) or depression (19% vs 52%, P = 0.009) than controls. Conclusions Whilst these results do not justify routine provision of PICU follow-up clinic appointments for all parents, they do suggest that rates of long-term distress in those who fi nd the admission particularly traumatic could be reduced by a simple one-off intervention, which was feasible in a clinical setting. References As an integrated part of the Danish Healthcare Quality Program, Danish hospitals must have programs allowing each patient a contact person, who should take an active part in treatment and care. However, the concept is still not well implemented on a broader scale. Implementing a patient's contact person concept in an ICU produces new obstacles. The ICU diff ers from other clinical settings in various ways. It is heavier staff ed at all hours. The number of doctors is limited and nurses perform primary care. Each staff member has good insight in all patient cases, which are discussed at the daily conferences. So, is the patient's contact person really important in the ICU? Methods Questionnaires were handed out to the close relatives of every patient who stayed more than 72 hours in the ICU. Ninety-four questionnaires have been returned with usable data. No attempt to retrieve questionnaires from nonrespondents has been made. All were returned in marked envelopes, the questionnaire itself being unmarked. The questionnaire contained two questions on the patient's contact person: 1. In your experience, did you have a contact person? 2. Do you think there is a need for a contact person? Both questions were simple yes/no answers, with the possibility of adding comments. The analysis focused on quantity and quality, as displayed in the remarks made.",

The care provided in the ICU diff ers from other hospital settings, resulting in special needs for family members of the dying patient. We studied the characteristics of bereavement, the need for follow-up bereavement service and to determine whether the information and care in the ICU is suffi cient for relatives of deceased ICU patients. Methods A structured telephone interview was conducted in a 10-bed mixed medical-surgical ICU. Patients and respondents were selected according to four criteria: (1) the patient had died between June 2008 and June 2009 in the ICU, (2) there had to be at least one relative, who (3) was involved during the ICU stay preceding death and (4) had suffi cient knowledge of the Dutch language. For each deceased patient, one family member was identifi ed as eligible for study participation. All eligible family members were fi rst contacted by an ICU nurse to ask for agreement with the study. Furthermore, the structured interview was then emailed or sent to the family members so they would be able to read the questionnaire prior to the actual telephone interview. Three weeks after the initial telephone call by the nurses, the respondents were contacted for the structured telephone interview with specifi c attention to the use of new medication, work-related problems, resuming normal activities, money problems and sleeping problems.Results A substantial portion of the respondents (37%) complained about sleeping problems. A majority (77%) was satisfi ed with the provided ICU care and the information provided. Almost all of the respondents (90%) understood the fatal sequence of events during the dying process. Most common complaints concerned communication and the information provided. The need for a follow-up bereavement service was reported by 35% of the respondents. Reasons for such a service were fi rstly to deal with the death of the family member and secondly to answer remaining questions.Conclusions This study demonstrates that most relatives had resumed their normal activities. In addition, there was a high level of satisfaction with the care provided in the ICU, although many considered a followup bereavement service potentially useful. The most frequent persisting bereavement characteristic was related to sleeping problems.",

Nurses may not always assess the needs of relatives the way they themselves experience their needs to provide support. This qualitative study was conducted to explore the experiences of relatives of patients in adult neurosurgery ICUs in Shiraz, Iran. Methods In this qualitative study, grounded theory was used to explore the experiences of 10 relatives of patients in neurosurgery ICUs. The data consisted of in-depth interviews and participant and nonparticipant observation. All data were recorded by writing in a notebook, and subsequent listening to the audio recordings and reading through the transcription of each interview was done.Results Five major categories emerged from the data: information seeking, vigilant attendance, intense emotion, need for respect, and need to care about patient privacy. The most important needs of relatives were to have information about the condition of their loved one, talk to a doctor and their questions are answered honestly. The other theme was vigilant attendance. Many informants pointed out that they were willing to stay continuously inside the ICU to see what is going on and they wanted fl exible open visiting. Also relatives showed the suff ering they experience and their needs for support and empathy. The study also defi ned two new concepts in this area: need for respect and care about patient privacy. Conclusions It is essential that intensive care nurses are able to identify the specifi c needs of family members to provide appropriate supportive interventions.",
