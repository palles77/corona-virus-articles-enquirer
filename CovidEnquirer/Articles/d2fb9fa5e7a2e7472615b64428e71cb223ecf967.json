Several reports of hourglass-like constriction in the upper limb involve the anterior and posterior interosseous [3] , axillary [4] , musculocutaneous [5] and suprascapular [4] nerves. Spontaneous palsies of digital nerves are not as frequent as in other nerves of the upper limb; only a few cases have been described in the literature [6] .

None of these causes were found in our patient's history, unlike in 62% of cases reviewed by Pan et al. Vigasio and Marcoccio [4] and Haussmann and Patel [8] have suggested that joints are the main location of constriction due to the repeated movements. Several articles [8, 9] report cases of multiple palsy in different areas that cannot be explained purely by a mechanical cause. The initial phenomenon seems to be inflammatory and fascicles being twisted during the motion. Local inflammation, whatever the cause, leads to edema of the nerve and weakness of the fascicles, which become vulnerable. This may lead to the development of adhesions between the fascicles and adjacent structures during abduction or rotation of the shoulder, elbow flexion/extension, forearm rotation.",

Interfascicular neurolysis was the first choice for our patient, mainly due to anatomical reasons. Macroscopic examination showed only one site of constriction and the fascicles appeared intact. The fact that it was an exclusively sensory nerve was also a factor. Simple interfascicular neurolysis was preferred from a risk-benefit point of view, versus resection with direct repair or nerve grafting. The challenge of this treatment is pain reduction.
