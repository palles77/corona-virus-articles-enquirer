It belongs to one of the three superfamilies of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIase) that binds to the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A with high affinity [1] . The member of Cyp was first identified in mammals, where first human Cyp was identified as a specific cytosolic binding protein for the immunosuppressive cyclosporin A (CsA) drug [2] . Both Cyclosporine and Cyclophilin A make a complex (CypA-Cs) that bind to and inhibit the calcineurin and protein phosphatase activity, which further lead to the prevention of T-cell activation in mammals [3, 4] . Cyps are much conserved, ubiquitously distributed and is one of the most abundant proteins (about 0.1-0.4%) in the cytoplasm [5] [6] [7] . It plays an important role in diverse biological activities, i.e., transcriptional regulation, immunomodulation, cell signaling, protein folding, and trafficking [8, 9] .",

CypA was among the first identified cyclophilins, discovered independently by two researchers in 1984 [2, 13] . Later in 1989, amino acid sequence analysis confirmed that these proteins were the same [14, 15] . CypA increased the proliferation of human pancreatic and lung cancer cells by the activation of p38-MAPK and Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) pathways [16] . The CypA has also acted against immune-mediated injuries, e.g., Acetaminophen liver toxicity [17] . It also induced the release of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, MMP-2, and MMP-9), and cartilage destruction during rheumatoid arthritis [18, 19] . Likewise, in hepatocellular carcinoma (SK-Hep-1) cell line, Cyp A upregulated the expression of many cytokine-related genes like IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3 [20] .",

It causes viral nervous necrosis (VNN) or viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) which primarily affect the brain and eyes of juveniles and hatchery-reared larvae of several marine fish species [21] . Its genome composes of two segmented positive single-stranded RNAs i.e., RNA1 & RNA2, which encodes RdRP (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) and Capsid genes, respectively [22] . In recent years, these viruses have attracted much attention because of their ecological and economic impacts on the aquaculture industry [23] [24] [25] . To date, numerous organisms Cyps are reported with its specific roles in regulating the life cycle and replication of several viruses such as in facilitating the virus replication that including HCV [26] , HCMV [27] , HIV-1 [28] , HBV [29] , Corona virus [30] , Vaccinia virus [31] , Vesicular stomatis virus [32] etc. Conversely, there are viruses reported to be inhibited by CypA comprising of Influenza virus [33] and Rota virus [34, 35] . Thus, it is clear that CypA can able to regulate the stability between the host and a pathogen in either beneficial or destructive manner through different pathways. Since, its role in pathogenesis CypA is considered as a biomarker for disease and been an appealing target for preparation of therapeutic agents. Hence, it is important to reveal the critical role of Grouper fish CypA in the regulation of infectivity and replication of Red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and these results might offer insight into the complexity of the virus-host interactions also worth of proposing CypA as a target for anti-viral therapy for future.",

The figure highlights the secondary structure along with its confidence rate where 9 different color bands in the figure highlights the specific intensity of the confidence rate. The 3D structure of GF-CypA as shown in Fig. 1C was also predicted through Phyre 2 online software. To further evaluate the molecular evolution of GF-CypA, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on multiple sequence alignments species as mentioned earlier. As shown in Fig. 1D , the phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that CypA gene obtained from GF-1 cells was formed from the teleost, amphibian, arthropod, avian, and mammalian clade.

Studies on the precise role of these proteins are still in the beginning stage, and the exact mechanism of anti-RGNNV activity remained to be explored in the future. Further investigations of the molecular mechanism of how GF-CypA inhibits RGNNV replication may help us better understand host-virus interactions from anti-infection perspective. These findings will have a major impact on scientific areas comprising genetic improvement to fight against NNV infection, development of viral vectors for gene therapy and discovery of new anti-viral drug targets.",
