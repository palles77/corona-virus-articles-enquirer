A crosssectional survey of HCWs using a self-administered, anonymous survey was conducted between February 2007 and April 2007. The setting was a large Victorian metropolitan health service, employing over 10 000 staff. Sixty-seven percent of HCWs stated they would be available to work during a pandemic, 26% stated they would stay at home to care for their children, whereas 10% admitted they would stay away because of fear of catching influenza. The majority of employees expected to be provided with personal protective equipment, antivirals and vaccine (92%, 90% and 89%, respectively). HCWs also believed that family members should be supplied with antivirals and vaccine (64% and 63%, respectively), 20% believed they needed a place of residence while working, 45% were prepared to be relocated to another site, and 36% were prepared to change to another duty. The survey highlights several areas that need attention in preparing for a pandemic. Targeted education is required now for all those HCWs who will be expected to work during a pandemic. How we cope with the next inevitable pandemic depends on the depth of our preparation.",

The scope of a pandemic is larger than the surge capacity of most (if not all) healthcare facilities to manage. Healthcare workers (HCWs) and first responders will be at high risk of exposure and will likely become ill at rates similar to the general population. This will reduce the number of HCWs available to cope with the expected influx of patients with influenza requiring care. The impact of a pandemic will be widespread and so help (resources, staff) from other hospitals are not likely to be available. Compounding staff shortages due to illness will be personnel who are absent from work because of the need to stay at home and care for dependents or because of fear of catching influenza themselves. Previous studies have shown that during disasters, many HCWs may be unwilling or unable to report for duty. 3 Hospitals will need to consider HCWs fears and the expectations of all employees to maximise staffing at a time when the number of staff available will be at a minimum.",

Southern Health is the largest metropolitan health service in Victoria, Australia, providing services to a population of over 750 000 and employing over 10 000 staff. A self-administered, anonymous survey was placed on the hospital intranet. Staff were advised of its presence by personal email (medical staff), by advertisement on the intranet and in the Chief Executive Officer's newsletter. Additionally, as the survey was conducted during the annual influenza vaccination campaign, an opportunity to complete the questionnaire was also available when staff attended for their influenza vaccination. Surveys were either completed directly onto an electronic database (via intranet access) or returned to the investigator for entering. The survey included questions on personal characteristics such as sex, age, presence of dependent children and job classification. The job classification variable was collapsed into five categories: medical (consultants, registrars, residents, medical students), nursing, clinical support (dietician, social work, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, interpreter, pharmacy, security, patient services attendant), administration (including clerical staff) and hotel services. Respondents were also asked to respond to 16 statements using a 5-point Likert scale: 'strongly disagree', 'disagree', 'undecided', 'agree' and 'strongly agree'.",

HCWs should have the right to decide if they will attend work during a pandemic. However, past experience has shown that the majority believe it is their duty to attend during such mitigated disasters. There was little debate over the expected duty of HCWs during the SARS outbreak, even though some staff were infected and died as a result of their exposure. 13, 14 Education may further reduce the fear of attending work. Our study showed that 74% believed they needed more education in this area. Barnett and colleagues have suggested that several issues can be addressed to improve the effectiveness of an emergency response. These include addressing the uncertainty around the safety of the working environment, emphasising the value of each employee in the emergency response and providing sufficient attention to stress management in the workplace. 15 Pandemic planning must also include consideration of the risks to which HCWs can reasonably be expected to expose themselves and their families. Health services have a duty of care to minimise risks. Educating in advance of a pandemic, including the expected role of each HCW would assist with identifying potential risks. We have found that 92% of HCWs believe they should be supplied with appropriate protective equipment while working in the hospital, 92% believed they should be supplied with antivirals and 89% expected to be first in line to receive vaccination. This would be in keeping with the current pandemic influenza plan in Australia, where HCWs and others in essential services will be first in line to receive antiviral prophylaxis and pandemic vaccine. 11 Interestingly, although the majority of HCWs expect to receive pandemic vaccine, the annual uptake of influenza vaccine in our and other health institutions barely reaches 50%. Education is a priority here and should be commencing now, as evidence suggests that myths surrounding influenza vaccination contribute to HCWs refusal to be vaccinated. 16 Many of our staff also believed that family members should have access to antivirals and vaccine (64% and 63%, respectively) if they were to come to work during a pandemic. Although this is probably not feasible in the current Australian plan, 11 given the fact that both vaccine and antivirals will be in short supply at least during the first wave of a pandemic, some thought in this area is worthwhile. The risk of influenza transmission to family members by front-line workers needs to be considered. Furthermore, the provision of antivirals and vaccine to close family members may also reassure HCWs and act as an extra incentive to work during a pandemic.",

In the 1918 pandemic, medical students ran entire wards, performing both medical and nursing duties. 17 We have found that 24% of all staff would not be prepared to be relocated to another site, while 29% were not prepared to take on another duty. Our figures reveal that medical staff were more open to the idea of site relocation during a pandemic but less responsive to the notion of a change in job structure than were nursing staff. Education and discussion of how to manage these sensitive areas is required. It is vital that all staff understand in advance the importance of their role during an influenza pandemic, otherwise they will fail to present when they are most needed. 18 Our survey has highlighted several areas that need attention in preparing for a pandemic. Targeted education is required now for all those HCWs who will be expected to work during a pandemic. Areas of importance include: education on hospital pandemic protocols; lectures on influenza preparedness; focussed education on the value of influenza vaccination; and infection control issues related to influenza.",
