            "text": "When we look back to Edward Jenner vaccination of a young man in 1796, we cannot help thinking that he was both lucky and crazy. Crazy because he decided to test in a human being a hypothesis based mainly in the traditional belief that people who had acquired cowpox from the udders of a cow were thereafter resistant to smallpox, a quite devastating disease, and lucky because (even considering that he did not know this at that time) he succeeded to induce protection against a pathogen through the induction of an immune response directed against a different agent. Not only was he able to protect the young man but he took the first step towards the development of a vast new field, vaccination. It is acceptable to say that Jenner was lucky because he succeeded in promoting protection against smallpox using a cowpox virus and this induction of protection in a cross-reactive way is believed to be quite rare. Nevertheless, more and more examples of cross-reactive immune responses are being described and we are beginning to admit that cross-reactivity is far more common and important than we used to think. Here we review cross-reactivity in the immune system and the plasticity of T cell recognition. Based on the existence of T cell receptor promiscuous recognition and cross-recognition of conserved viral immunodominant epitopes, we propose two approaches to develop wide spectrum viral vaccines. The first one is based on the identification, characterization, and cloning of immunodominant viral epitopes able to stimulate responses against different viruses. The produced peptides could then be purified and serve as a basis for vaccine therapies. A second strategy is based on the identification of conserved patterns in immunodominant viral peptides and the production of synthetic peptides containing the amino acid residues necessary for MHC anchoring and TCR contact. Although we are still far from a complete knowledge of the crossreactivity phenomenon in the immune system, the analysis of immunodominant viral epitopes and the identification of particular ''viral patterns'' seems to be important steps towards the development of wide spectrum viral vaccines.",

Pathogens, in 0306 turn, have developed strategies to evade our defense mechanisms. Some of the interaction mechanisms between the immune system and pathogens are already well understood. For viral systems, however, the subject is not fully elucidated, mainly due to the highly mutable nature of viruses, which requires the development of specialized and complex defense mechanisms.",

Part of these proteins is, however, proteolytically degraded in the proteasomes, along with other cytosolic self-proteins or even proteins provenient from intracellular bacteria that have been also ubiquitinated. This degradation process generates peptides 6-30 amino acids (aa) long that may, potentially, bind to the MHC class I molecule peptidic cleft, in the endoplasmic reticulum, being transported to the cell surface. These peptides have little variation in size, presenting normally 8-12 amino acids. The peptide size restriction is due to the nature of the MHC I peptidic cleft, which presents closed extremities, contrasting to the peptidic cleft of MHC class II molecules which can accommodate longer sequences (up to 30 aa).",

The number of sequences yielded, in such case, would reach some hundreds. Considering that the exemplified protein size is relatively small and considering the classical idea that each CD8+ T cell recognizes only one peptide, the repertoire of memory T cells would have to be larger that 10 12 , the total number of lymphocytes in human beings, to be efficient [1] . Therefore, the recognition of peptidic sequences must involve mechanisms with a certain plasticity and adaptability, without, however, loss of specificity. This would allow the immune cell repertoire to be shaped according to ongoing experiences leading to the establishment of memory, but at the same time, it would allow the maintenance of a source of naive, inexperienced cells.",

It is important to note that the PV peptide which elicited the cross-reactivity shared six out of eight amino acids with the one used to sensitize the cells. In that case, infection with an heterologous virus stimulated a strong T cell immunodominant response to an epitope that was previously weak and subdominant, indicating that not only the hierarchy of virus-specific T cells can be more malleable than formerly imagined, but also that the hierarchy of immunodominance can be deeply affected by previous encounters with heterologous pathogens.",

The crossresponse occurred against one endogenously pro-cessed epitope of the IV neuraminidase (IV NA-231 ), which is conserved among influenza viruses, being normally included in vaccines, and an HCV immunodominant viral determinant called HCV NS3-1073 , which is an HLA-A2 determinant frequently recognized during acute HCV infection. In the previous example, the degree of similarity between the sequences of both epitopes, which share seven out of nine amino acids, seems to be quite important. Additionally, both peptides present conserved aa in residues 2 and 9, the critical residues for binding to the HLA-A2 molecule. Although they differ in two aa, these non-identical amino acids belong to the same chemical group and share certain physicochemical characteristics.",

One variant of this IV peptide, the FLU-M1:58-66, presented cross-reactivity with an HIV-I epitope. Cells stimulated in vitro with FLU-M1 were capable of lyse not only cells marked with the IV epitope but also cells presenting the HIV epitope [8] . It is interesting to point out that this observation was done in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from both HIV-infected and uninfected individuals, suggesting that, in individuals vaccinated against influenza, the response generated against the IV matrix protein could direct a specific immune response to an HIV epitope. It is known that the IV matrix protein and the HIV capsid and matrix proteins present notable structural similarities, mainly in the three-dimensional structure of the proteins rather than homology in the amino acid sequence. Interestingly, both virus proteins have similar functions in their assembly, mediating the encapsidation of the ribonucleoprotein complex by the viral membrane [9] . Another work demonstrated the existence of cross-reactivity in the immune responses directed to japanese encephalitis and dengue viruses [10] .",

Thus, the task of reducing infection spreading can be delegated to cross-reactive cells and the organism will gain time to assemble a more specific artillery. The idea that cross-reactive T cells lead to a low affinity response to heterologous epitopes generated the argument that this could cause deleterious effects to the host, who would lack an acute, virus-specific immune response for some types of viral infections. In fact, some works have verified that such situation is possible and can be used by viruses as an extra evasion mechanism. It was observed that human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)-infected individuals that had developed cervical cancer presented an almost complete absence of specific T lymphocytes directed to the oncoprotein (HPV16) E7 11-19(20) epitope. Cross-reactivity between this epitope and a coronavirus epitope called NS2 52-60 was identified. It was proposed that frequent contacts with a virus could lead to an ''exhaustion'' of the T cell repertoire, which could lead to an inefficient CTL response. Moreover, this same HPV epitope presented considerable sequence homology with peptides from diverse organisms, including some sequences from self-peptides, providing support for the suggestion of toleration of the immune system [20] . Another strategy used by viruses to evade the immune system is exemplified by the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), which codes for an evasion immune protein (m152/gp40). This protein prevents the presentation of an immunodominant peptide, provenient from an antiapoptotic protein (M45), in pathologically relevant tissues. Thus, this peptide stimulates a CD8+ long-term response, but the target is not present in the tissues of interest [21] .",

Interestingly, the TCRs from all isolated clones had substantial sequence homology in their CDR3 region 3.

Except for these conserved residues, these synthetic peptides could be filled with amino acids with few or none lateral chains (that could interfere with the MHC/ TCR contact).

Also, different HLA alleles require different peptides as anchor motifs and this variability should also be considered during peptide screenings. It is important to point out that sometimes viral peptides are associated to the development of autoimmunity and, consequently, it will always be necessary to take into account the cross-reactive phenomenon as a whole and not only as a characteristic of immune responses against pathogens.
