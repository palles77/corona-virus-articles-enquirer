Here I explain how the idea of mutualistic viruses has been defended in recent virology, and I explore four important conceptual and practical consequences of this idea. I ask to what extent this research modifies the way scientists might search for new viruses, our notion of how the host immune system interacts with microbes, the development of new therapeutic approaches, and, finally, the role played by the criterion of autonomy in our understanding of living things. Overall, I suggest that the recognition of mutualistic viruses plays a major role in a wider ongoing revision of our conception of viruses.",

The aim of this paper is, via the analysis of several major examples of recently described mutualistic viruses, to assess the novelty of this claim as well as its conceptual and practical consequences. As explained below, the existence of mutualistic viruses has been known for some time, but the claim based on current data is different and much stronger that previous ones. Under its present form, the idea of mutualistic viruses raises key questions about the way scientists might search for new viruses, microbe 1 -immune system interactions, the development of new therapeutic approaches, and, finally, the role the criterion of autonomy plays in our understanding of living things. I suggest that this idea can play an important role in a more general reconceptualization of viruses, at the interface between medical and ecological-evolutionary approaches.",

In the footsteps of Ivanovksi, Beijerinck identified the tobacco mosaic virus as an infectious agent (a \"contagious living fluid\") exhibiting special features, in particular the capacity to pass through a filter that blocks bacterial agents (van Helvoort, 1996; Bos, 1999) . Similarly, it is the search for small-size infectious agents that led, in the first half of the 20th century, to the discovery of many viruses (including those of yellow fever, rabies, dengue fever, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, etc.) (Hughes, 1977) . Reflecting on these very important discoveries, Australian virologist and immunologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet (1899e1985) writes in his influential book Viruses and Man: \"We can define a virus then as a microorganism responsible for disease which is capable of growth only within the living cells of a susceptible host e and which is normally considerably smaller than any bacterium.\" (Burnet, 1955) . Viewing viruses as pathogenic is consistent with the etymology of the word (from the Latin vira, \"poison\"), and with the basic assumption of the germ theory of disease (defended, in particular, by Koch and Pasteur), which asserts that diseases are due to germs (though there were tensions between the germ theory of disease and the first conceptualizations of viruses, because several scientists maintained that only bacteria could provoke diseases).",

It is particularly true, of course, of medically oriented microbiologists, many of whom define viruses as \"prototypic obligate intracellular pathogens\" (Nolan, Gaudieri, & Mallal, 2006; Casadevall, 1998; Kawamoto et al., 2003) . Significantly, similar definitions of viruses as pathogens are found in papers by molecular biologists (Anand, Schulte, Vogel-Bachmayr, Scheffzek, & Geyer, 2008) , immunologists (Jirmo, Nagel, Bohnen, Sodeik, & Behrens, 2009) , plant biologists (Wu, Lee, & Wang, 2011) , and virologists (Cibulka, Fraiberk, & Forstova, 2012) . Adding more weight to such definitions, a number of textbooks focus on viral pathogenesis (Nathanson, 2007) , and Nobel Prizes awarded to the field of virology are often explicitly presented as rewarding the discovery of disease-causing viruses, such as HIV and human papilloma virus (which causes cervical cancer, and potentially other cancers as well) in 2008 (Weiss, 2008) . Overall, as observed by William C. Summers, \"The basic idea that viruses are the material basis for disease transmission has changed little in the past 150 years; what has changed is our understanding of the essential properties and biological capacities of viruses\" (Summers, 2014) .",

A first illustration concerns cases in which the realization of the life cycle of an organism is dependent on the presence of a virus within the host. Mutualistic polydnaviruses of parasitoid wasps constitute a very important and widespread example of this phenomenon. Many wasps (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonoidea, Braconidae) paralyze their hosts (which are arthropods, principally of the order Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Hemiptera), and lay their eggs inside them, where the wasp larvae then develop. (In koinobiont species, the wasp larvae grow within the still living host, and ruthlessly feed on it. 2 ) Normally, the host immune system would wall off the wasp eggs (through a phenomenon called \"encapsulation\"), and eliminate them. Yet particles of viral (polydnavirus) origin suppress this immune response. In other words, the wasp eggs can survive and develop only because a virus integrated into the wasp's genome actively counters the immune defense of the host larva. Perhaps surprisingly, this phenomenon has been known for more than thirty years (Edson, Vinson, Stoltz, & Summers, 1981) , but it is only recently that it has been understood in detail (Espagne et al., 2004; B\u00e9zier et al., 2009; Herniou et al., 2013) .",

The integration of polydnavirus into parasitoid wasps is also an evolutionarily ancient phenomenon, contrary to some other examples discussed below: it occurred several times, million years ago.

However, one of the reasons why polydnaviruses are so fascinating is that, even though they have evolved into vertically transmitted agents, they continue to function in many respects like more traditional viruses (Herniou et al., 2013; Strand & Burke, 2014) . As noted by Herniou et al. (2013) , bracoviruses in particular are not fossil genomic remnants but active viruses, unlike most endogenous viral elements. Most classic viral functions have been conserved and bracoviruses undergo all the steps of a conventional virus cycle. Surprisingly, the main difference between polydnaviruses and classical viruses is the separation of the virus cycle between two cell types and hosts: the production of the infectious particles is done by calyx cells in the wasp ovaries, while the infection involves parasitized lepidopteran host cells.",

A retrovirus is an RNA virus that uses its own reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome, and then this DNA is integrated into the genome of the host cell. An endogenous retrovirus is a retrovirus that has been incorporated into the germline cells, and remains persistent in these cells. Recent research has shown that the evolution of placental mammals has been made possible thanks to an endogenous retrovirus. It was demonstrated first in sheep (Dunlap et al., 2006) , and then in mice (Dupressoir et al., 2009) , and it is certainly a phenomenon common to all mammals, including humans (Mallet et al., 2004) . The fusion of cell membranes is required for the development of the placental syncytium, which is a major component of the immunological \"barrier\" of the fetus, and this syncytial fusion is possible only thanks to an endogenous retrovirus.",

Thus, these bacteriophages have a mutualistic relationship with their host, by conferring a previously unrecognized virus-based immunity. Hostemicrobial relationships in the gut are extremely rich and complex, in particular because different microbes can have antagonistic or stimulating effects one on the other.

In 2009, however, it was demonstrated that the protective effect of this symbiotic bacterium is in fact due to the presence of a symbiotic bacteriophage within the bacterium (Oliver, Degnan, Hunter, & Moran, 2009 ). In that case, it is the virus, located within a bacterium, that is responsible for the protective effect on the host.

While the idea of mutualistic viruses in the past was highly speculative and based on a very limited number of examples, current research offers copious data about a wide diversity of examples across many species, as well as key molecular details about how the virus and host interact (Cadwell, 2015b; Roossinck, 2011 Roossinck, , 2015 Virgin et al., 2009) . For most scientists, there is a significant difference between a speculative idea and its empirical demonstration, and it is precisely this gap that recent data have filled in. Indeed, the current claim that viruses can be mutualistic may be seen as an important contribution to a more general revision of our conception of viruses. What is particularly significant is that the notion of mutualistic viruses, by undermining the still dominant view that viruses are generally harmful, can have key practical consequences on research in virology. Four of these conceptual and practical impacts can be explored here: the impact on how scientists search for new viruses, on the conception of how the host immune system interacts with microbes, on the potential use of viruses as therapeutic agents, and on the criterion of autonomy in the definition of living things.",

Switching from the classic view to a conception according to which viruses can have all sorts of ecological interactions with other microbes and with their hosts opens up a whole new world for virus research. This is in particular what has strikingly happened in recent marine virology, where, with the help of new technological advances including viral metagenomics, viruses have been proved to be much more diverse than expected (more than 5,000 viral genotypes or species in 100 L of sea water, and up to 1 million species in 1 kg of marine sediment), and they are able to \"manipulate\" their environments (including their virus, protist, and metazoan environments) in many different ways (Rohwer & Thurber, 2009 ). As Rohwer and Thurber say, \"So far, the study of marine viruses has been dominated by the search for pathogens, but this will need to change if we are to appreciate the diverse ways that viruses affect life on Earth.\" (On virus ecology, see O'Malley, this special issue).",

A healthy human is infected by more than ten permanent chronic systemic viruses (including herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, anelloviruses, adenoviruses, papillomaviruses), and this number may in fact be far higher (Virgin, 2014 ).

Indeed, when a host is infected by a microbe, it is crucial to understanding not only how the host will react, but also how other (resident and external) microbes will react. The field of co-infection 7 studies (e.g., Virgin, 2007; Alizon, de Roode, & Michalakis, 2013; Osborne et al., 2014; Reese et al., 2014) focuses on that question. When a host is immunocompromised after being infected by a microbe, other microbes (opportunistic ones) might invade it (as happens with HIV, for instance). Sometimes, two pathogens are much more dangerous if they attack their host together, leading to a combined assault (Jamieson et al., 2013) . In many other cases, resident viruses protect the host against pathogenic microbes, as happens with latent herpesviruses that protect the host against L. monocytogenes and Y. pestis bacteria (Barton et al., 2007) , as explained above. Overall, strong evidence supports the view that infection by chronic viruses constantly stimulates the immune system, making it able to respond better to different pathogens (Virgin et al., 2009) . Endogenous retroviruses in mammals could also play an important role in immunity (Chuong, Elde, & Feschotte, 2016) . Although our understanding of viral infections and immune responses comes primarily from the study of acute infections, it seems crucial, given the ubiquity of chronic viruses, including many mutualistic viruses, to re-think radically hostevirus interactions (Virgin et al., 2009) .",

First, it is in principle possible to eliminate or control pathogenic bacteria in a host through the use of bacteriophages (viruses of bacteria) that can kill those bacteria (thus creating an \"alignment of fitness\" of the host and the bacteriophage against the bacteria). \"Phage therapy\" was popular in several countries of the Soviet Union, especially Poland and Georgia, but it was often neglected or considered too dangerous in Western countries (Stone, 2002; Chanishvili, 2012 ). Yet recent years have witnessed a striking resurgence of interest in phage therapy, not least because of a growing concern about resistance to antibiotics among many bacteria (Reardon, 2014; Blaser, 2014; Matsuzaki, Uchiyama, Takemura-Uchiyama, & Daibata, 2014) . Second, as our knowledge of the ecological interactions occurring within a given host progresses, we can imagine being able to manipulate co-infections. For example, it seems possible to stimulate (or maintain) a given virus to fight or control a pathogen (a bacterium, fungus, helminth, or virus). Finally, an extremely stimulating avenue consists in the use of viruses that can kill tumor cells, called \"oncolytic viruses\" (Russell, Peng, & Bell, 2012; Burke, Nieva, Borad, & Breitbach, 2015) .",

J. McFall-Ngai, 2002; Pradeu & Carosella, 2006; Gilbert & Epel, 2015) . Each human, for example, hosts trillions of symbiotic bacteria, which are acquired from the environment, and are indispensable for digestion, normal development, and normal functioning of the immune system (Round & Mazmanian, 2009) .",

For instance, many bacteria cannot be cultured outside their host (this includes Chlamydia trachomatis (Byrne, 2003) , but also, for instance, many members of the human gut microbiota (Goodman et al., 2011) . Moreover, even if one focuses on parasitic interactions, there exist many obligate intracellular parasitic bacteria (e.g., Carsonella ruddii) with less than 150 genes. Overall, \"heteronomy\" (that is, the fact for a biological entity to be dependent on other, persistent biological entities) (Pradeu, 2012) is ubiquitous in the biological world, so one of the main arguments to separate viruses from the rest of the biological world breaks down.",

In previous work, I have suggested that any entity that engages in physiological interactions controlled by an immune system should be considered as an organism (Pradeu, 2010; Pradeu, 2012) . That view promotes the role of the immune system in the definition of organismality because the immune system constitutes a principle of inclusion and exclusion, in the sense that it determines what is part of a common entity, and what is excluded from it. Importantly, this criterion of inclusionexclusion is not based on the origin of the entities under consideration (that is, on the opposition between the endogenous \"self\" and the exogenous \"nonself\"): resident bacteria and viruses in an animal, for example, are part of that animal (Pradeu, 2010) . 7 In that context, what \"infects\" the host is not necessarily harmful; it can be dangerous, benign, or mutualistic.",

For the moment, the answer is negative, because no formal immune system has been identified in viruses, contrary to the situation found in Bacteria and Archaea following the groundbreaking discovery of the CRISPR-Cas system (Barrangou et al., 2007) . Nonetheless, future studies might well unravel an immune system of some kind in viruses, as some giant viruses can apparently be infected by virophages (viruses of viruses) (La Scola et al., 2008; Pearson, 2008; Fischer & Suttle, 2011; Yau et al., 2011) . It therefore seems extremely likely that they have evolved defense strategies against these potential invaders. From an immunological point of view, therefore, viruses could be considered as \"organisms\", if future research confirms that they possess immune-like mechanisms.",

Viruses are everywhere in, on, and around living things, from prokaryotes to plants, fungi, and animals; they are sometimes detrimental, and at other times useful or even indispensable. By their ubiquity and diverse functional roles in every possible host, viruses extend the view that biological individuals are not autonomous but, on the contrary, heterogeneous (i.e., made of entities of different origins, often belonging to different kingdoms) and heteronomous (i.e., dependent, to some degree, on other biological entities to complete their life cycle). Moreover, ecological and evolutionary competition needs to be reconceptualized, both spatially and temporally. Competition occurs not between selfish, autonomous, and homogeneous entities, but between temporarily constituted associations or aggregates (some of them long-lasting, others transient). In a given context, the three actors of the hierarchy made by a virus in a fungus in a plant (M\u00e1rquez et al., 2007) help each other and constitute a collaborative unit, in competition with other composite biological entities; however, in another context, this fitness alignment can break down. The study of biological competition and cooperation thus requires the careful investigation of how ecological interactions between and within hosts are established and broken down. Admittedly, many studies in ecology and evolution already pay attention to this highly dynamic nature of competitive/cooperative interactions, but my suggestion is that seeing the biological world through a viral lens strengthens this approach, and even makes it inevitable.",

It has often been observed that medically-oriented microbiology on the one hand, and evolutionarily and ecologically-oriented microbiology on the other, rarely interact either in research or in teaching (Smith, Rubinstein, Park, Kelly, & Klepac-Ceraj, 2015). Findings of mutualistic viruses now bring together these two branches of microbiology. Viruses are central to both human health and disease. They interact with us and regulate our relations with other resident entities, including bacteria, helminthes, and fungi. It is increasingly recognized that being infected by viruses is the norm rather than a deviation and resident viruses are a fundamental component of our basal immunity (Virgin, 2014) . They are, therefore, likely to play a key role in how we respond to any potentially pathological threat. These rich and reciprocal interactions call for the adoption by medical doctors of a \"multiple infection\" perspective, which draws on ecological and evolutionary concepts and models (Cadwell, 2015b; Choffnes, Olsen, & Mack, 2014) . In turn ecologists and evolutionary biologists could avail themselves of the extensive molecular data accumulated by the medical sciences, especially about resident viruses (Woolhouse, Webster, Domingo, Charlesworth, & Levin, 2002) . If this combination of medical and evolutionary-ecological approaches in microbiology is realized in teaching practice, we can expect from the new generation of microbiologists an enriched vision of microbes and our interactions with them.",
