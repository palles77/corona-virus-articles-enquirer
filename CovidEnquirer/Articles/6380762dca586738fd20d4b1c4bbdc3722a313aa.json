(B) The USP9X active site catalytic triad with occlusion of the active site by Gln1683 hydrogen bonded to the backbone of blocking loop 2 (BL2, green) and the Cys1566. (C) USP9X Gln1683 equivalent Gln293 in USP7 rotates to accommodate the Ub C-terminal tail (red) into the catalytic groove. (D) A switching loop (purple) of USP9X between helices \uf0614 and \uf0615 containing Gln1683 is two residues longer compared with the equivalent switching loop of USP7 (cyan for Ub-bound USP7). The USP9X switching loop protrudes into a space otherwise occupied by the C-terminal tail (green) of USP7, suggesting USP9X does not have a similar regulatory mechanism as that of USP7. The secondary structure of USP9X is shown on the top of the line. The catalytic triad is indicated with red circles and zinc finger cysteines with grey boxes. The two large disordered insertions and \uf062-hairpin insertion are shown as dotted lines and underlined, respectively. Sequence alignment was generated using Clustal Omega(1) and ESPript 3.0(2). Conservation of USP9X residues was calculated using the ConSurf server(3). The most conserved regions are indicated by arrows. (A) The insertion in USP9X CD box 6 adopts a \uf062-hairpin structure (green) and pairs with the \uf062strands in the fingers subdomain of a symmetry-related USP9X molecule (light purple) in the crystal lattice to form an extended \uf062-sheet. The Zn ion in the fingers subdomain is shown as a sphere. (B) Meta-analysis of the propensity of the box 6 insertion to be disordered in the Database of Disordered Protein Prediction (D2P2). The box 6 insertion has low propensity to be disordered. (C) Secondary structure prediction using RaptorX suggests the box 6 insertion has low propensity to be \u03b1-helix (red) or \u03b2-strand (blue). Cleavage assay using triUb-NC1-CL2 of (A) K11-, (B) K63-and (C) K48-linkage. DiUb substrates of the corresponding linkage are included as a comparison. Time points for K63-linkage are 5, 10, 30, and 60 min while K11-and K48-linkages are 15, 30, 60 min. USP2 CD-catalyzed cleavage is also included in each assay to show that the di-and tri-Ub substrates can be cleaved. Cleavage of triUb-NC1-CL2 results in an HA-tagged diUb product which is 1 kDa larger than the native diUb as indicated on the gel. ",
