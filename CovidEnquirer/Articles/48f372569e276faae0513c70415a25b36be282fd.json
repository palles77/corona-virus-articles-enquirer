Of these, 10 (19.2%) were caused by HKU1 (6 single infections and 4 coinfections) during the period January-May 2006. Diagnosis was made by using RT-PCR for all four hCoVs, and in parallel, in-house developed group-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for HKU1 and 229E. HKU1-specific MAb was able to retrospectively identify 8 of 10 HKU1 strains detected by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four HKU1 strains were genotype A and six genotype B. In HKU1-infected patients, the predominant clinical symptom was rhinorrhea (nine patients). Within group II hCoV, HKU1-infected patients had a significantly lower rate of lower ARTI compared to OC43-infected patients. Conclusion: HKU1 hCoV strains circulated in northern Italy during the winter-spring season [2005][2006]. Both HKU1 genotypes were detected. HKU1-specific MAb may contribute to the rapid diagnosis of HKU1 infections currently performed by RT-PCR.",

            "text": "Following the first reports in the 1960s, human coronaviruses (hCoVs) 229E and OC43 were found to circulate at a high rate in several seroepidemiological studies (McIntosh et al., 1970) . However, difficulties encountered in virus isolation and recovery from cell cultures hampered medical investigations of these viruses until the recent identification of the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (hCoV-SARS) in 2003 (Peiris et al., 2003) . In recent years, the development of molecular techniques prompted the resumption of clinical studies aimed at identifying the role of group I (229E-like) and group II (OC43-like) hCoVs in respiratory syndromes. The new technological tools allowed the recent discovery of two new hCoVs: one, referred to as NL63, belongs to group I and is distantly related to 229E (Fouchier et al., 2004; Van der Hoek et al., 2004) , and the second, referred to as HKU1, is more closely related to the group II prototype hCoV-OC43 (Woo et al., 2005a) . HCoV-HKU1 was first detected in two patients with pneumonia in Hong-Kong (Woo et al., 2005a) , and then reported elsewhere (Esper et al., 2006; Garbino et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006; Vabret et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2005b) . In addition, a number of studies from different countries have shown that hCoV-NL63 can be recovered from respiratory secretions of both immunocompetent children and immunocompromised adults (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Boivin et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2006a; Mo\u00ebs et al., 2005) .",

Respiratory secretions were processed and aliquoted as previously reported (Sarasini et al., 2006) . NPAs were examined for influenzavirus types A and B, parainfluenzavirus types 1-4, human respiratory syncytial virus, and human adenoviruses by both direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining and culture. In addition, human metapneumoviruses were detected by both MAbs (DFA and culture) and RT-PCR as previously reported (Gerna et al., 2006b; Percivalle et al., 2005) . Furthermore, all four hCoVs were tested for by RT-PCR, while 229E and HKU1 strains were tested for in parallel by in-house developed MAbs, as detailed below.",

            "text": "Results of the present study indicate that hCoV HKU1 has been circulating among hospitalised patients in northern Italy during the winter-spring season 2005-2006 along with the other three known hCoVs. Thus, following initial and subsequent reports from Hong Kong (Lau et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2005a,b) , HKU1 has been shown to circulate in several countries on different continents, such as Australia (Sloots et al., 2006) , Switzerland (Garbino et al., 2006) , France (Vabret et al., 2006) , United States (Esper et al., 2006) and, now, Italy. The two recently discovered hCoVs, NL63 (Fouchier et al., 2004; Van der Hoek et al., 2004) , belonging to group I, and HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005a) , belonging to group II, along with the widespread use of molecular techniques allowing detection of conventional respiratory hCoVs 229E and OC43 (McIntosh et al., 1970) , have contributed to the consistent increase in detection of hCoV-positive respiratory specimens. In this study, more than 10% of positive respiratory samples were due to hCoV infections. HKU1 infection interested mostly immunocompetent infants and young children, as well as immunocompromised adult patients.",

However, in parallel, MAbs have been developed for the rapid diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. In this study, we report results obtained with the first HKU1-specific MAb developed. The high specificity of the HKU1-specific MAb was shown by negative DFA results obtained in a large series of NPA smears positive for other respiratory viruses, including OC43, 229E and NL63, while the level of sensitivity appears promising for diagnosis of HKU1 infections. Similarly, a pool of three different 229E-specific MAbs for the prospective diagnosis of 229E infections appeared to be a valuable alternative to RT-PCR.",

Correlation between HKU1 genotype and clinical syndrome or clinical symptoms was neither observed in our study, nor in previous studies. However, from a clinical standpoint, a major finding emerging from our study is that, within group II hCoVs, HKU1-infected patients suffered mostly from upper ARTI, while OC43-infected patients were mostly affected by lower ARTI episodes. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.04), and was not observed between the two members of group I hCoVs. Neither bronchiolitis nor pneumonia were detected in our series of HKU1-infected patients. Following the initial report describing the association of HKU1 infection with pneumonia in two adult patients, an epidemiological and clinical study extended to the entire patient population in Hong Kong reported a predominance of upper ARTI, in agreement with the present study (Woo et al., 2005b) .",

As with other hCoVs, the simultaneous presence in NPAs of other respiratory viruses in association with HKU1 was a frequent event. HKU1 infections were by far predominantly associated with upper respiratory tract syndromes, and the most common symptom was rhinorrhea. No association with bronchiolitis or pneumonia was observed.",
