After its causative agent, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was confirmed, laboratory methods, including virus isolation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serologic methods, have been quickly developed. In this study, we evaluated four serologic tests ( neutralization test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], immunofluorescent assay [IFA], and immunochromatographic test [ICT]) for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV in sera of 537 probable SARS case-patients with correlation to the RT-PCR . With the neutralization test as a reference method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.2%, 98.7%, 98.7%, and 98.4% for ELISA; 99.1%, 87.8%, 88.1% and 99.1% for IFA; 33.6%, 98.2%, 95.7%, and 56.1% for ICT, respectively. We also compared the recombinantbased western blot with the whole virus-based IFA and ELISA; the data showed a high correlation between these methods, with an overall agreement of >90%. Our results provide a systematic analysis of serologic and molecular methods for evaluating SARS-CoV infection.",

If a sample showed a 4-fold difference or greater in titers in the duplicated sample runs, it was judged as an invalid outcome and had to be retested.

The antigen used in this test is a recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV. The inside of the ICT device contains a nitrocellulose strip, on top of which is a detection zone. In the detection zone, the goat anti-mouse IgG and SARS-CoV N protein have been immobilized separately onto a control line and a test line. In the middle of the strip, the mouse IgG and SARS-CoV N protein are to be coupled respectively with some colloidal gold particles, which serve as a detector. At the bottom are two wells for the sample and the buffer, respectively. The ICT is carried out following the manufacture's instruction. Briefly, 15 \u00b5L of undiluted serum sample is added to the sample well, and 220 \u00b5L of testing buffer to the buffer well.

In addition, 24 serum samples from patients with other diseases were used as a specificity panel to analyze whether these assays showed any cross reactions with SARS-CoV. These patients were definitely confirmed as non-SARS-CoV-associated diseases. As shown in Table 3 , no positive results were detected to these serum specimens, and the measurements of specificity were all 100% for the neutralization test, ELISA, IFA, and ICT. Table 4 compares results of the RT-PCR and the neutralization test in specimens from probable SARS casepatients. In this comparison, throat swab specimens from 381 probable SARS case-patients were used for RT-PCR, and their convalescent-phase serum specimens, collected on day 28 or longer after illness onset, were tested with neutralization test. Of the 207 cases, which were positive by neutralization test, 145 were tested positive with RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of RT-PCR compared with results with neutralization test were of 52.2%, 78.7%, 74.5%, and 58.1%, respectively.

Therefore, antigens for these serologic tests must be prepared in the biosafety level 3 laboratory. To provide a convenient tool and decrease the risk of infection, a Western blot with several SARS-CoV recombinant proteins was developed and evaluated. Cloned peptides carrying epitopes can be produced on a large scale and with an acceptable degree of purity. Table 6 shows the comparison of recombinant protein-based Western blot with whole virus-based IFA, and ELISA. Ninety-five serum samples were used in this comparison. The sensitivities, specifici-ties and overall agreements of Western blot were 91.3%, 89.88%, and 90.5%, compared with IFA results; 97.6%, 88.8%, and 92.6%, compared with ELISA results.",

However, during the convalescent phase of the disease, detecting antibodies in serum specimens is more important than detecting viral RNA. Four serologic diagnostic methods, including neutralization test, ELISA, IFA, and ICT were each evaluated and compared for antibody responses to SARS-CoV infection, in which the neutralization test was held as a reference method. The specificity of these methods is extremely good (100%), since no cross-reactions were detected with a non-SARS disease panel.",

The measured performance of ELISA was so outstanding, with the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value levels exceeding 98%, that ELISA was chosen as a confirmation alternative. In the case of IFA, both the sensitivity and negative predictive value levels were above 99%; however, the specificity of 87.8% implies that IFA may cause false-positive problems. Therefore, a weak positive IFA result should be retested by a neutralization test or ELISA. The ICT, though simple and quick to perform, is lacking in adequate sensitivity in our evaluation.

In this study, we compared a recombinant-based Western blot with the whole virus-based IFA and ELISA, and the data showed a high degree of correlation between these methods, with an overall agreement above 90% (Table 6) .

This rate was much lower than that reported in Hong Kong, which showed that the IgG seroconversion to SARS coronavirus was as high as 93% (70/75) at day 28 after the illness onset (15) . This difference may come from some different circumstances between Hong Kong and Taiwan. In the SARS outbreak of Hong Kong, the index case-patient and the infectious source leading to the outbreak were quite clear, and 75 patients were admitted to the same hospital within 4 days. From the epidemiologic point of view, therefore, the SARS outbreak was a typical cluster outbreak. In Taiwan, the samples from probable SARS case-patients were collected from over 50 hospitals between March and June 2003. Some might not have been true SARS patients but were reported as probable SARS cases. This result is The serum specimens of 28 days and more after the illness onset in probable SARS case-patients were tested in this comparison. (16) . With this new classification, the positive rate of antibodies to SARS-CoV in probable SARS patients in Taiwan was increased to 86.6% (227/262), by using the serum samples on day 28 or beyond after the onset of illness. These rates are closer to, though still lower than, rates from Hong Kong. Samples from the remaining 322 cases, excluded from the category of probable SARS cases, may have to be tested for other pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and human metapneumovirus to clarify a diagnosis.",
