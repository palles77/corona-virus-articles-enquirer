Deoxynivalenol (DON), the 25 most abundant trichothecene in food and feed, causes vomit and diarrhea in animals 26 and human. However, whether DON exposure could affect PEDV infection remains 27 unknown. Herein, we investigated the impacts of DON on entry and replication of 28 PEDV, morbidity situation of piglets and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-29 seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, 30 receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 \u03bcg/kg DON, respectively. We 31 observed significant increases in the diarrhea rates, the villous injury of jejunums and 32 the PEDV proliferation of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and mesenterium of piglets in 33 experimental groups compared with control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like 34 vesicles and the autophagy-related protein expressions were also increased in 35 experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that, approximately 2 hrs post-infection, 36 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM DON promoted PEDV entry (P < 0.05) in IPEC-J2s and resulted 37 in tight junction protein occludin internalization. Knockdown of occludin and 38 CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy-induced 39 occludin internalization in DON-promoted PEDV entry. We also observed that, 24 hrs 40 post-infection, a significant increase in PEDV replication after 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM 41 DON treatment, along with the induction of a complete autophagy.

Mechanistically, DON-caused 46 innate immune escape was related to the upregulation of LC3B, which further inhibited 47 STING phosphorylation.

Its primary pathogen is the coronavirus PED 55 virus (PEDV). Growing evidence indicates that pathogen infection is not the only factor 56 of PED outbreaks, other non-infectious factors is also related to this disease. We 57 guessed some ubiquitous substances, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), that lead to pig 58 intestinal epithelial cell stress might encourage the progress and spread of PED. In the 59 present study, the weaning piglets infected naturally with PEDV and the IPEC-J2 cell 60 line were selected as models to explore the effects of DON on PEDV infection, 61 morbidity and gut barrier. Our results showed that DON exposure can promote PEDV 62 infection in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism might be related to LC3B-63 mediated autophagy.

The expression186 of autophagy-related proteins, occludin and PEDV-N were then measured. The results 187 showed that the expression of LC3-II and the degradation of SQSTM1 were increased 188 significantly in LC3B +/+ IPEC-J2 cells treated with DON, which were consistent with 189 the changes of occludin expression. However, the increase in occludin expression and proliferation by DON was abolished in LC3B -/-IPEC-J2 cells (Fig 4B). Next, we 191 performed pEGFP transfection assays and observed that the colocalization of LC3B, 192 occludin and virus induced by DON were arrested in LC3B-IPEC-J2 cells (Fig 4C), 193 suggesting that DON induced occludin internalization upon a canonical autophagy. 194 Low concentrations of DON facilitate PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. 195 To determine the effects of DON on PEDV replication, IPEC-J2 cell monolayers were 196 infected with 1 MOI PEDV for 2 h, and cultured with DON at concentrations between 197 0.01 and 1 \u03bcM for an additional 24 h.

Moreover, the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-Green fluorescent 214 protein (GFP-LC3) tandem reporter construct was used to further measure DON-215 induced autophagic flux. In the acidic pH of the lysosome, lysosomal hydrolysis can 216 attenuate the green fluorescence of this tandem autophagosome reporter, whereas it has 217 no effect on red fluorescence. Therefore, autophagosomes have both GFP and mRFP 218 signals, whereas autolysosomes have only mRFP signals [26]. As shown in Fig 5D, 219 treatment with CQ, which inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, 220 resulted in yellow color-labeled autophagosomes, and RFP-LC3-labeled puncta 221 structures were detected in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells expressing the mRFP-GFP-222 LC3 reporter after incubation with 0.5 \u03bcM DON. The similar results could be observed 223 in the immunoblotting experiment (Fig 6A and 6C). These observations indicated that 224 DON induced a complete autophagic flux in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells, which 225 might be responsible for DON-promoted PEDV infection.226 CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B in IPEC-J2 cells suppressed the 227 promotion of DON to PEDV replication. 228 To further confirm the role of autophagy in DON-promoted PEDV replication, we 229 compared the viral yield in LC3B +/+ and LC3B -/-IPEC-J2 cells exposed to DON. A 230 significant decrease was observed in the protein expression of LC3B in LC3B -/-IPEC-231 J2 cells compared with that in LC3B -/cells. Moreover, PEDV viral yield exhibited the decrease, as demonstrated by the down-regulation of PEDV-N protein level (Fig233 7B), PEDV viral titers(Fig 7C), and PEDV-N / -S mRNA levels(Fig 7D), indicating 234 that the decreased viral yield was due to the inhibition of autophagy.

The immunoblotting results revealed that there was no 241 significance in JAK1, PI3K, JNK/p-JNK and ERK/p-ERK proteins expression after 242 DON treatment. But, a significant increase in p-p38 was observed (Fig 8A). In addition, 243 p-MTORC1 was significantly downregulated by DON. So, we supposed the activation 244 of p-p38 might induce autophagy. To determine our hypothesis, the inhibitor of p-p38, 245 SB202190, was supplied. The data showed that SB202190 inhibited the LC3II 246 activation and SQSTM1 degradation induced by DON, upregulated the p-MTORC1247 expression(Fig 8B)and blocked the formation of autophagosomes(Fig 8C).

            "text": "), suggesting that STING signaling 275 was required to control the replication promotion of PEDV by DON and its antiviral 276 activities were mediated by autophagy.282 Thus, the co-existence of DON and PEDV occurs frequently in global pig farms. However, whether DON exposure may increase the susceptibility to PEDV remains 284 unknown. In this study, we provide the first strong evidence that DON exposure can 285 promote PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism might be Experiments in vivo were performed on twenty-seven weaning 296 piglets received the basal diet containing DON. In the present study, we found, for the297 first time, that low concentrations of DON could facilitate PEDV infection in vivo and 304 reported here, we demonstrated that DON could aggravate occludin internalization in 305 PEDV-infected cells. When the occludin gene was silenced by siRNA, the promotion 306 of DON to PEDV entry in IPEC-J2 cells was disappeared simultaneously, indicating 307 that occludin internalization contributes to the DON-induced PEDV entry. And what 308 was responsible for occludin internalization was further confirmed. Autophagy is a selective degradation process of various subcellular structures, 310 including protein aggregates. Increasing evidence indicated that autophagy is related to 311 cell membrane integrity and membrane proteins distribution [36]. It can serve dual roles 312 in virus infection with either pro-or anti-viral functions depending on the virus and the 313 stage of the viral replication cycle [37]. It not only is required for an antiviral response 314 against some virus infection [38], but also take an active part in the viral life cycle by, 317 Our data in this study have showed that the autophagy levels were significantly 318 increased by DON in vitro and in vivo, which are consistent with the viral infection 319 levels. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the LC3B blocked the promotion of DON 320 to PEDV viral yield. Therefore, we concluded that autophagy is required for DON-325 decrease in mTORC1 levels. But, how did DON-activated autophagy promote PEDV replication? The primary 327 role of autophagy in innate immune is regulating the IFN-I expression [44, 45]. It is 328 well known that IFN-I is an important antiviral defense cytokine in innate immunity. Upregulation of IFN-I can inhibit viral proliferation, whereas downregulation of it 330 contributes to virus infection [46]. PEDV infection is one of the main mechanisms for 331 inhibiting IFN-I signaling during continuous infection [47]. However, questions that 332 whether DON exposure could facilitate down-regulation of IFN-I in PEDV-infected 333 cells remain unanswered. We investigated the effects of DON to IFN-I expression and 334 confirmed that low concentrations of DON facilitated PEDV to escape innate immune 346 on non-infectious factors. This study provides evidence for the first time that low 347 concentrations of DON can promote PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo, documenting 348 that autophagy activated by DON modulates the promotion. The present study also 349 provides new insight into developing potential novel antiviral strategies against PEDV",

Briefly, IPEC-J2 cells cultured in 96-well plates were inoculated with 456 10-fold dilutions of the harvested culture supernatants for indicated time. Microscope 457 was used to detect the viral antigen according to the cell damage. Viral titers were 458 expressed as TCID50/ml by using the Reed-Muench method.",
