We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1\u22122.4). We estimate a large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0\u22129.3), and thus timely actions were crucial. The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 [4] .

For a given COVID-19 case with symptom onset on the t-th day, the number of secondary cases follows a negative binomial (NB) distribution with a mean at Reff(t) and a dispersion parameter at k [7] . The Reff(t) is the effective reproduction number, and Reff(t) = R0[N -C(t)]/N, where C(t) is the cumulative number of cases at the t-th day and R0 is the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 to be estimated. The time delay between symptom onset dates of a primary case and any of its associated secondary cases is the serial interval (SI). Hence, for a given primary case with symptom onset on the t-th day, the symptom onset time of each associated secondary case is expected to be the summation of t and SI of COVID-19. It is conventional to assume the SI to follow a Gamma distribution with mean at 4.5 days and standard deviation (SD) at 3.1 days [8, 9] .",

Under the later scenario with mean SI at 7.5 days, we find that the R0 is larger than 5 which is not in line with WHO estimates and hard to justify in a 'quarantine' setting. In particular, the later scenario yields a higher AIC by 10 units than the former scenario with mean SI at 4.5 days. Thus, we argue the former scenario is most likely the reality, and consider it as the main results.",

We obtained a large k which implies that COVID-19 is much easier to persist than other coronavirus with a small k [6, 7, 13,14]. On the other hand, our finding highlights the different characteristics between COVID-19 (less superspreading) and SARS (more superspreading), which should be taken into consideration into mitigation.

It is hard to believe that such a large amount of asymptomatic cases were infected before the quarantine start date (Feb 5, 2020) and missed in Feb 15 test. The number of tests are much larger than the number of positive results, and this implies high effort of testing and relatively reliable data. It is reasonable to argue that the quarantine is not so successful to prevent the emergence of asymptomatic cases, but successfully slowed down the occurrence of symptomatic cases, as suggested by studies based on cases onset date data. In the other words, quarantine measure likely changed the way how the virus transmitted, thus the level of symptoms of cases. Presumably, in these studies of onset date data only, asymptomatic confirmations are not counted as cases. In this study, we use laboratory confirmations with updated (shorter) serial interval of COVID-19. The lesson learnt here is certainly useful in future similar outbreaks of COVID-19.",

Under scenario (1), timely reduction in the susceptible population could lower the final size and sustainably reduce the daily incidences. Under scenario (2), the lower the R0, decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, the lower the final size and the later the peaking time will be. If the susceptible pools and R0 are reduced simultaneously, the COVID-19 outbreak on the ship will be likely mitigated and postponed largely, see Fig 1(d).",
