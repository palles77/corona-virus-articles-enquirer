The number of Syrian refugees in Turkey has increased over 200 times from 2012 to February 2019, (14 237 to 3 635 841 in number) [2] of whom 6% of them stay in temporary shelters, and 94% live in community settings [2] .

In 2012 and 2013, at the beginning of the conflict, high numbers of hepatitis A cases were reported from Syria because of the interrupted health services in the country [17, 18] . In Syria, HAV vaccination was not included in the national immunization programme; however, when Syrian refugees arrived in Turkey, all the children were vaccinated according to the national immunization programme of Turkey, which covers HAV vaccination at 18 and 24 months (Table 1) . Environmental health measures including clean water supply and sanitation for temporary settlements were carried out in collaboration with AFAD and Provincial Public Health Directorate. Water was chlorinated to contain 0.05 ppm chlorine and water quality was assessed via collecting water samples in various end points in the temporary shelters three times per week. For people living in temporary shelters, skin and soft tissue infections, animal bites and urinary infections were reported to be the most common reasons of admission to infectious diseases outpatient clinics [19] .",

Syrian refugees are at risk of contracting tuberculosis because of overcrowding, stress and other determinants, and the likelihood of having the disease pre-departure, which may have increased due to the fragmented and disrupted health services. Such disruption and fragmentation in the public services would also have an impact on the surveillance systems meaning that these official numbers should be treated with caution. For example, Warrington et al. [31] showed that the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection among Syrian refugees screened within the first 2 weeks after their arrival in Canada was 9% and they have calculated the annual rate of infection as 0.42%, which led to an estimation of tuberculosis incidence in the source population to be 40 per 100 000 [31] .

In a recent survey performed in 36 European countries, different approaches for screening and management of tuberculosis among refugees was reported and treatment for the people coming from low incidence settings for the prevention of latent tuberculosis infections was emphasized [32] . For example, a study in Netherlands suggested to cease the tuberculosis screening programme for refugees coming from countries with <50 per 100 000; however, a similar study in Belgium suggested the continuation of pre-entry screening. Another study in the UK indicated that while migrants screened for tuberculosis posed a negligible risk to the population in the host country it might trigger stigmatization or xenophobia [32] .",

In Turkey, tuberculosis case management protocols indicate treatment for latent tuberculosis if there is contact with the tuberculosis patient [33] .

Within the temporary shelters by using active screening and referral or physician presumption and consecutive examination, a total of 1022 cases among Syrian refugees with active tuberculosis were diagnosed and treated between the years 2012 and 2015. By the year 2010, the proportion of the patients who were born outside of Turkey among all tuberculosis patients reached 6.8%. In 2015, 489 Syrian refugees were diagnosed with tuberculosis, which makes 56% of overall refugees with tuberculosis. The latest numbers from 2016 indicates that 12 417 new tuberculosis cases have been reported and 200 (1.6%) of them were multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. Syrian refugees constitute 4% (n \u00bc 508) of the total tuberculosis cases and ten Syrian refugees (2%) out of 508 were reported to be MDR [34] .

Every migrant child in Turkey has a right to access the same immunization services as the citizens of Turkey and this service covers vaccines for 13 diseases. 2. Language is one of the major barriers to access healthcare services. Integration of Syrian health workers in the primary healthcare system has been a successful way to overcome such a barrier. Besides, it helped to increase the outreach activities for vaccination services. 3. The health-seeking behaviour of Syrian refugees shows that there is a tendency to skip the primary care services and a demand for secondary and tertiary level healthcare. It, therefore, burdens these services. Training Syrian healthcare workers and integration of guides for Arabic speaking patients to assist service provision in the hospital level might alleviate the workload. 4. In line with access to healthcare, access to medication is also provided by the MoH, which allows the control of the potential infectious diseases by timely interventions. In terms of infection control, compliance to antimicrobial stewardship principles plays an important role for it is known that the rate of antimicrobial resistance because of overconsumption in Turkey is already high [41] . 5. Syrian refugees are obliged to stay in a defined province when they arrive in Turkey and register there. However, for of various reasons, Syrian families have moved from their first registered address quite often, within and between the cities. This poses a barrier to follow-up certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, where adherence to directly observed therapy is key to treatment success. Therefore it is necessary to build a strong surveillance system for refugees. 6. Measles cases are increasing and measles remains the number one vaccine-preventable disease threat. Although Syrian refugees are receptive to vaccination services, seeking vaccination services remains a problem because of high mobility and lack of knowledge about refugee health centres. Therefore, dissemination of information and raising awareness through increasing the available health education activities in collaboration with local NGOs would improve vaccination uptake among refugees. 7. There has been an increase in leishmaniasis cases since 2011. No significant increase has been detected in tuberculosis, vectorborne infections except leishmaniasis, health associated infection (HAI) and STIs. Considering that Syrian refugees are a vulnerable group in Turkey, in cases of an outbreak with a public health threat, such as influenza or norovirus infections, Syrian refugees could be affected more. 8. When infections, such as WNV, MERS and Dengue fever, among Syrian refugees have not been detected, lack of awareness among healthcare workers should be taken into consideration. Therefore, trainings for potential threats and emerging infections as well as strengthening the surveillance should be improved.",
