Malaria was the most common diagnosis among those requiring hospitalization for fever, accounting for 27-48% of admissions in four recently published series. 6, [8] [9] [10] Among 336 travelers and migrants in Switzerland who presented to an outpatient clinic with a history of fever or malaise and who had blood tests for malaria, 29% had laboratory confirmation of malaria. 11 In a study of 153 pediatric patients hospitalized with febrile illness after tropical travel, diarrheal illness (27%) and malaria (14%) were the most common diagnoses; a treatable infection was identified in 46%. 12 Infections, such as respiratory tract infections, hepatitis, diarrheal illness, urinary tract infections and pharyngitis, with a broad or worldwide distribution, accounted for more than half of fevers in some series 7, 8, 12 and the cause of fever remained undefined in about one-quarter of cases. Specific agents most often identified, in addition to malaria, include dengue fever, hepatitis A, rickettsial infections, streptococcal pharyngitis, typhoid fever, gastrointestinal infections (caused by Campylobacter, salmonella, shigella) and amebic liver abscess. In the GeoSentinel database, among ill-returned travelers with a confirmed or probable diagnosis, malaria was the most common specific agent identified in travelers with a systemic febrile illness. 5 Differences between travelers and local residents Important differences exist between short-term travelers to developing countries and residents or long-term visitors in types of infections commonly seen and in clinical manifestations. These differences reflect differences in likelihood of exposure to infections and age and intensity of exposure. For example, melioidosis (caused by the Gram-negative soil-and water-associated bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei) is a common cause of community-acquired sepsis in northern Thailand, yet is rarely seen in short-term travelers. In many developing countries, hepatitis A is not viewed as an important problem. Clinical disease is largely unknown because most children are infected at a young age when infection is mild and often unrecognized. Older children and adults are immune, but the virus regularly contaminates food and water and poses a threat to non-immune travelers who enter the area. Katayama syndrome, an immune-complex mediated disease, is seen in travelers and persons newly infected with schistosomiasis but not in residents of endemic areas who have been repeatedly exposed to the parasite. 13",

Remote travel is sometimes relevant but most severe, acute life-threatening infections result from exposures that have occurred within the past 3 months. Important treatable infections that may occur >3 months after return include malaria, amebic liver abscess and visceral leishmaniasis. In the study by O'Brien et al. 9 that analyzed hospitalized patients with fever after travel, 96% were seen within 6 months of return from travel. Although the initial focus should be on travel within the past 3-6 months, the history should extend to include exposures a year or more earlier, if the initial investigation is unrevealing. More than one-third of malariainfected travelers in a study from Israel and the USA had illness that developed more than 2 months after return from endemic areas. 15 Onset of illness >1 year after return occurred in <2% of malaria patients reported to the CDC in 2003. 16 Table 53 .2 lists many of the infections seen in travelers by time of onset of symptoms relative to the exposure and the initial clinical presentation.

            "text": "Malaria remains the most important infection to consider in anyone with fever after visiting or living in malarious areas. In non-immune travelers, falciparum malaria can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated urgently. Although most patients with malaria will report fever, as many as 40% or more may not have fever at the time of initial medical evaluation. 20 Risk of malaria varies greatly from one endemic region to another, but in general risk is highest in parts of sub-Saharan Africa; most severe and fatal cases in travelers follow exposure in this region. Tests to look for malaria should be done urgently (same day) and repeated in 8-24 h if the initial blood smears are negative. Infected erythrocytes may be sequestered in deep vasculature in patients with falciparum malaria so few parasites may be seen on a blood smear even in a severely ill patient. Prompt evaluation is most critical in persons who have visited areas with falciparum malaria in recent weeks. In the USA in 2003, approximately 80% of reported patients with acute falciparum malaria had onset of symptoms within 1 month of return to the USA; another 14% had onset of illness before arriving in the USA. 16 Use of chemoprophylaxis may ameliorate symptoms or delay onset. No chemoprophylactic agent is 100% effective, so malaria tests should be done even in persons who report taking chemoprophylaxis. Many antimicrobials (e.g. TMP-SMX, azithromycin, doxycycline, clindamycin) have some activity against plasmodia. Taking these drugs for reasons unrelated to malaria may delay onset of symptoms of malaria or modify the clinical course.",

            "text": "Although fever and headache are commonly reported in malaria, gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms may be prominent and may misdirect the initial attention toward other infections. Thrombocytopenia and absence of leukocytosis are common laboratory findings. A prospective study of 335 travelers and migrants with suspected malaria found WBC count <10 000 cell/L, platelet count <150 000/\u03bcL, hemoglobin <12 g/dL and eosinophils <5% to be associated with malaria parasitemia. 11 Dengue Dengue, a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that exists in four serotypes, is the most common arbovirus in the world. It is increasing in incidence in endemic areas and is an increasingly common cause of fever in returned travelers. [21] [22] [23] Dengue is found in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. Among travelers, dengue is seen most often in visitors to SE Asia and Latin America (including the Caribbean) and infrequently in travelers to Africa. Because humans are the main reservoir for the dengue virus, which is transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito that inhabits urban areas and lives in close association with humans, travelers visiting only urban areas can become infected. Symptoms of dengue, also known as breakbone fever, typically begin 4-7 days (range 3-14 days) after exposure. Common findings are fever, frontal headache, and myalgia. Approximately 50% of patients have skin findings, which can be a diffuse erythema or a maculopapular or petechial eruption. Intense itching may be 24 Supportive care, including i.v. fluids, can be life-saving in DHF/ DSS. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by serologic tests; viral isolation or detection of viral RNA by PCR is available in some laboratories. Because specific IgM antibodies take several days to develop (usually present by day 5 of illness), serologic diagnosis may not be possible in the early febrile period. IgG antibody response can be difficult to interpret because of extensive cross-reactions with other flaviviruses (e.g. yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile). 25 It is likely that only a minority of cases that occur in travelers are documented. Two Israeli studies try to estimate the attack rate in travelers. Among 104 young Israeli adults who had spent at least 3 months in tropical areas, four (3.8%) had dengue-specific IgM antibodies, suggesting recent dengue infection. 26 In another study, the attack rate was 3.4/1000 travelers to Thailand in 1998. 27 In the GeoSentinel database, confirmed or probable dengue fever was the most common specific diagnosis in patients with febrile systemic illness who had traveled to tropical and subtropical areas in the Caribbean, South America, south central and SE Asia. 28 ",

Among 78 cases of tick typhus in German travelers, 87.2% had an eschar at the time of evaluation, but only 17.9% recalled having a tick bite at that site. 29 More than 70% had acquired their infections in southern Africa. Rashes may be present but many rickettsial infections (even among the spotted fever group rickettsia) are spotless. R. australis, R. africae, and rickettsialpox can cause a vesicular rash that may be mistaken for varicella, monkeypox, or even smallpox. High fever, headache, and normal or low white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia are characteristic. Lymphadenopathy may be present. Infections may be confused with dengue fever.

Laboratory findings include a normal or low white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, and elevation (usually modest) of liver enzymes. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, constipation and vague abdominal discomfort may be present, as well as dry cough. In contrast to the abrupt onset of fevers in dengue and rickettsial infections, the onset of typhoid fever may be insidious. Leukocytosis in a patient with typhoid fever should raise suspicion of intestinal perforation or other complication. Diagnosis should be confirmed by recovery of Salmonella typhi (or S. paratyphi) from blood or stool. 33 Culture of bone marrow aspirate may have higher yield than blood or feces but is generally not favored by clinicians and patients. Serologic tests lack sensitivity and specificity. Increasing resistance of S. typhi to many antimicrobials makes it important to isolate the organism and to do sensitivity testing. Resistance to ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, and chloramphenicol is now common, and resistance has also been reported to quinolones. 34 Multiple studies have identified the Indian subcontinent as a destination with relatively high risk for enteric fever in travelers. 35 In the USA, travelers to six countries (India, Mexico, Philippines, Pakistan, El Salvador, and Haiti) accounted for 80% of the cases. 36 The efficacy of typhoid vaccines in published studies varies widely depending on the type of vaccine, number of doses, and population studied. As noted above, the efficacy of commonly used vaccines may be 60-70%. 19 The important observation for clinicians evaluating returned travelers is that typhoid fever remains a concern (albeit lower) in persons who have received a typhoid vaccine. Infections with S. paratyphi may be relatively more common as a cause of typhoid fever in vaccinated populations because vaccine protects mainly against S. typhi. 18, 33 Notably, the course of S. paratyphi A was not found to be milder than that of S. typhi infection. 37 Leptospirosis Although leptospirosis has a broad geographic distribution, infections in humans are more common in tropical and subtropical regions. Recreational activities of travelers, including white water rafting in Costa Rica and other sports involving water exposures, have been associated with sporadic cases and large outbreaks. 38 Among 158 competitive swimmers in the Eco-Challenge in Malaysia in 2000, 44% met the case definition for acute leptospirosis. 39 Although clinical manifestations may be protean, common findings include fever, myalgia, and headache. Among 353 cases reported from Hawaii, 39% had jaundice and 28% conjunctival suffusion. 40 Other findings, such as meningitis, rash, uveitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, oliguric renal failure, and refractory shock may be present. Multiple different serovars exist, and clinical presentation and severity vary with infecting serovar. In a large Brazilian urban outbreak in 1996, 43% of cases of leptospirosis were initially misdiagnosed as dengue fever. 41 Early, empiric therapy is recommended for suspected infection, especially if severe. Agents used include penicillins, tetracyclines, and ceftriaxone. 42 ",

Rickettsial infections can produce a petechial rash or purpura, and severe malaria may be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. Many viral infections, in addition to dengue, can cause hemorrhage. Most are arthropod-borne (especially mosquito or tick) or have rodent reservoir hosts. Among those reported in travelers are dengue fever (DHF), yellow fever, Lassa fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (and other Hantavirus-associated infections), Kyasanur Forest disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, and several viruses in South America (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, Sabia). Other geographically focal infections can cause hemorrhagic fever and would be expected primarily in travelers who visit rural or remote areas. Lassa fever responds to ribavirin therapy if started early. Several of the viruses can be transmitted during medical care, so it is important to institute barrier isolation in a private room pending a specific diagnosis. Identification of viral agents causing hemorrhage may require assistance from staff working in special laboratories, such as one available at CDC.

The parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis causes sporadic infection in many countries and was responsible for an outbreak of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in travelers to Jamaica in 2000. 47 African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), transmitted by an infective tsetse fly, initially causes a non-specific febrile illness. A chancre marks the site of the bite. If untreated, trypanosomes can infect the CNS and cause lethargy. Several cases have been seen in travelers after exposures, especially in Tanzania and Kenya.
