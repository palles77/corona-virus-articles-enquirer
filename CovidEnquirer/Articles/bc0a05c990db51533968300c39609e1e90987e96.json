            "text": "Animal movements between farms are a major route of pathogen spread in the pig production sector. This study aimed to pair network analysis and epidemiological data in order to evaluate the impact of animal movements on pathogen prevalence in farms and assess the risk of local areas being exposed to diseases due to incoming movements. Our methodology was applied to hepatitis E virus (HEV), an emerging foodborne zoonotic agent of concern that is highly prevalent in pig farms. Firstly, the pig movement network in France (data recorded in 2013) and the results of a nation-wide seroprevalence study (data collected in 178 farms in 2009) were modelled and analysed. The link between network centrality measures of farms and HEV seroprevalence levels was explored using a generalised linear model. The in-degree and ingoing closeness of farms were found to be statistically associated with high HEV within-farm seroprevalence (p < 0.05). Secondly, the risk of a French d\u00e9partement (i.e. French local administrative areas) being exposed to HEV was calculated by combining the distribution of farm-level HEV prevalence in source d\u00e9partements with the number of movements coming from those same d\u00e9partements. By doing so, the risk of exposure for d\u00e9partements was mapped, highlighting differences between geographical patterns of HEV prevalence and the risk of exposure to HEV. These results suggest that not only highly prevalent areas but also those having at-risk movements from infected areas should be monitored. Pathogen management and surveillance options in the pig production sector should therefore take animal movements into consideration, paving the way for the development of targeted and risk-based disease surveillance strategies.",

            "text": "Developing risk-based surveillance programmes for animal diseases is essential to support both strategic and operational decision-making in the field of animal and veterinary public health (Reist et al., 2012) . Indeed, mobilising resources towards targeted high-risk populations improves the sensitivity and cost-effectiveness of surveillance systems (St\u00e4rk et al., 2006) . The sub-populations to be targeted are usually chosen based on epidemiological studies assessing the probability of occurrence of the hazard in the sub-population (e.g. farms with specific risk factors) and/or the consequences of the disease potentially being introduced in this sub-population (e.g. economic effects, spread to other herds or countries) (St\u00e4rk et al., 2006) . However, most current pathogen surveillance programmes do not quantitatively include the risk related to animal movements, even though these are a major transmission route between farms. The exposure of farms or areas to pathogens is therefore closely related to the movement network's features. As such, animal movement data have been increasingly studied using social network analysis (SNA) methods, with farms being considered as nodes, and animal movements between farms as links (Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Bigras-Poulin et al., 2006; Bigras-Poulin et al., 2007; Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2009; Natale et al., 2009; Ribbens et al., 2009; N\u00f6remark et al., 2011; Lindstrom et al., 2012; Rautureau et al., 2012; Buttner et al., 2013; Dorjee et al., 2013; Guinat et al., 2016; Thakur et al., 2016) . Although in most studies network analyses have been motivated by the consequences of animal trade on the epidemiology of animal diseases (Keeling, 2005; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Bigras-Poulin et al., 2007; Mart\u00ednez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2009; Rautureau et al., 2012; Buttner et al., 2013) , the specific role of animal shipments in pathogen transmission and/or exposure has only scarcely been documented and rarely quantified, especially in the swine sector (Ortiz-Pelaez et al., 2006; Green et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2011; Porphyre et al., 2011; Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012; Nicolas et al., 2013; Beaunee et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017; Salines et al., 2017b; Sintayehu et al., 2017) . Analysing contact patterns related to pig trade could provide new insight into infection dynamics, pathogen spread and risk factors, helping to design risk-based surveillance programmes.",

HEV is highly prevalent in pig farms and is likely to spread between farms through the introduction of infected pigs, especially due to the pyramidal structure of the pig production sector (Salines et al., 2017a) . To date, no continuing HEV surveillance programmes have ever been implemented in industrialised countries (Salines et al., 2017a) .",

In short, previous data had indicated a farm-level prevalence close to 70% (Rose et al., 2010) ; the number of herds required to estimate 70% with 10% relative precision and 95% confidence, was 165. This number was increased to 186 to anticipate uncontrolled events. The herds to be sampled were determined by random selection of a list of slaughter dates and times from a database table. The observed minimum withinherd prevalence in this same preliminary study was close to 10% (Rose et al., 2010) and this value was retained as the minimum within-herd target prevalence to be detected. Given the sensitivity and specificity of the commercial serological tests (Rose et al., 2010) , this led to sampling of 30 pigs in batches with less than 50 pigs, 40 pigs in batches of 50-100 pigs and 50 pigs in batches with more than 100 pigs. Finally, 6565 sera and 3715 livers were randomly sampled from 186 pig farms located in 49 different French d\u00e9partements, corresponding to between 26 and 42 individual serum samples per farm and between 16 and 20 liver samples per farm collected at the slaughterhouse.

Factors associated with the outcome (p < 0.20) were then subjected to bivariable analysis. The objective was to identify strong correlations between each explanatory variable to prevent multicollinearity. If variables did not show strong collinearity (p > 0.05), they were included in a multivariable model. We also investigated the role of farm type as a potential confounding factor, by testing the link between farm type and the explanatory variables and the outcome with chi-squared tests and logistic regression, respectively. 2.4.1.1.

To stabilise the outputs of the procedure, the whole calculation was repeated 10,000 times, resulting in a risk distribution of HEV exposure for each d\u00e9partement.

The primary advantage of our study lies in combining epidemiology and network analysis to quantify both the impact of animal movements on pathogen prevalence within farms and the risk of areas being exposed to diseases due to between-area movements. HEV was chosen as a pathogen for implementation. Indeed, pig movements are likely to play a pivotal role in HEV epidemiology (Salines et al., 2017a) , although they have only scarcely been explored to date (Nantel-Fortier et al., 2016) . We assessed the role of pig shipments in relation to within-farm HEV seroprevalence level and to the risk of exposure of French d\u00e9partements to HEV.",

The quality of data in terms of accuracy, reliability, and comprehensiveness guaranteed the robustness of our results (Salines et al., 2017b) . The random selection process for tested farms and for individual pigs tested from each farm (Rose et al., 2011) ensured reliable estimates for the seroprevalence values used in our study. Moreover, the within-farm apparent seroprevalence estimates were corrected for serological test characteristics, providing true seroprevalence estimates. Eight production sites surveyed in 2009 ceased activity before 2013, limiting movement data availability to only 178 out of the 186 farms. This is consistent with the observed overall decrease in the number of pig farms in France (Salines et al., 2017b) . On the d\u00e9partement scale, the model involving the random sampling of farm-level HEV prevalence from beta distributions \u2212 with a weighted confidence interval \u2212 made it possible to take into account the low precision of some prevalence figures in quite a few d\u00e9partements where a low number of farms had been sampled.

            "text": "In the recent literature, several farm connectivity indicators were identified as risk factors for disease occurrence and spread (Martin et al., 2011; Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2017; Sintayehu et al., 2017) . Our study found that the farms' in-degree was positively associated with high within-farm HEV seroprevalence. This is consistent with several studies conducted in livestock production sectors showing that farms having a high in-degree were more likely to be infected with a pathogen (Martin et al., 2011; Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2017; Sintayehu et al., 2017) . Since repeated animal shipments to a farm from the same supplier were aggregated into a single link, the association between HEV seroprevalence and in-degree not only indicates that the HEV seroprevalence of farms increases with the number of incoming shipments, but it also proves that buying animals from several suppliers is linked to higher HEV seroprevalence. Our results also showed that the greater the ingoing closeness of a pig farm, the higher its HEV seroprevalence. A high value for the ingoing closeness centrality of a given farm indicates that the farm can be reached by its trade partners in only a few movements. Farm centrality in the network therefore appears to be a factor in vulnerability to HEV. This is consistent with the findings of previously published papers (Lee et al., 2017; Sintayehu et al., 2017) . As Lee et al. (2017) demonstrated for PRRSV, we found that the odds of having higher within-herd HEV seroprevalence was increased more by ingoing closeness than by in-degree, meaning that the level of connectivity with all other holdings in the network is a better predictor of HEV infection than the number of directly connected farms. Unlike for other pathogens (Lee et al., 2017) , no significant association was found between HEV within-farm seroprevalence and outdegree or outgoing closeness. The absence of an effect for these centrality indices was expected since HEV is mainly transmitted by infected pigs introduced into a na\u00efve population. Introduction into a farm due to the sole transit of a possibly contaminated truck loading pigs in the farm for an outgoing shipment is therefore extremely unlikely. Unlike Sintayehu et al. (2017) regarding bovine tuberculosis, our statistical model did not show any significant effect of a herd's betweenness on within-herd HEV seroprevalence. Production units with high betweenness centrality play a key role in the spread of disease throughout the network since they can build so-called bridges between distinct network components. Since we explored the role of centrality metrics in HEV occurrence in farms, and not in their ability to transmit HEV to other farms, the lack of an effect for betweenness was also expected. Ingoing and outgoing contact chain values were not found to have a significant effect on HEV seroprevalence either. Again, as we did not investigate a farm's potential for spreading HEV, the lack of a link between OCC and HEV seroprevalence is coherent. An association between ICC and HEV seroprevalence could have been expected. This kind of association has indeed been demonstrated in other studies, but Fr\u00f6ssling et al. (2012) showed that this link was pathogen-dependent: indeed, high ICC was Fig. 3 . Median risk of French d\u00e9partements being exposed to HEV through external incoming pig movements (10,000 simulations). An indicator of the risk of a French d\u00e9partement being exposed to HEV was calculated as the number of infected movements it had received from source d\u00e9partements divided by its total number of external incoming movements. found to be a risk factor in the occurrence of bovine coronavirus but not for bovine respiratory syncytial virus.",

The choice of the departmental level for our study was policy-oriented; indeed, French d\u00e9partements are local administrative areas and surveillance programmes are often designed and implemented on this scale. Due to the low precision of HEV farm-level prevalence data in quite a few d\u00e9partements, the distribution of the risk of exposure was large in these d\u00e9partements and the results in these d\u00e9partements therefore lack precision. Nevertheless, the outputs of the procedure used to assess the risk of HEV exposure were stabilised thanks to a high number of simulations. Given the form of the risk distribution, the median appeared the most appropriate metric for the risk of exposure. High variability in the median risk of exposure to HEV was observed depending on the French d\u00e9partement, confirming the relevance of designing targeted and differentiated surveillance strategies based on the area's risk level. Moreover, the discrepancy between the departmental observed prevalence figures and the departmental risk levels provides justification for monitoring not only highly prevalent areas but also those having atrisk movements coming from infected areas.",

Several research teams have recently developed farm-level risk scores based on animal movements. For instance, Sch\u00e4rrer et al. (2015) introduced a cumulative score taking several parameters into account, including the ICC, the number of animals per incoming movement, the type of pasture and the number of weeks per year with movements. Another study proposed a method for calculating a diseasespecific relative ratio for the increased probability of infection due to the introduction of animals (Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2014) . Ribeiro-Lima et al. (2015) also identified farms with a higher risk of bovine tuberculosis infection using a model based on a risk score at movement level. A further stage in our study could be to build a farm-level risk score including both risk factors linked to pig movements and other farm-specific risk factors for HEV that have previously been identified (Walachowski et al., 2014) .

More generally, the methods we proposed prove that farm-or area-level parameters derived from animal movements can support the risk-based selection of farms for surveillance programmes or the implementation of differentiated surveillance strategies depending on the area's movement characteristics. Therefore, risk-based epidemiological approaches benefiting from network analysis should be promoted.",
