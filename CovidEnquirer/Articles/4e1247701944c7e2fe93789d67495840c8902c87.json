In this mechanism, the 43s ternary complex, composed of the 40s ribosomal subunit carrying the initiator tRNA as well as a set of eukaryotic initiation factors [2,3], binds at the 5' end of capped cellular mRNAs and moves linearly, scanning the primary sequence of the mRNA, until an AUG codon in the context of a PuNNAUGPu (where Pu indicates A or G, and N any nucleotide) consensus motif is encountered. Subsequently, the 60s ribosomal subunit joins the complex and protein synthesis commences [ 1,3].",

Most notably, mRNAs of picomaviruses contain 5' NCRs that lack a 5' m7GpppG cap, are 600 to 1200 nucleotides in length and harbor many AUG codons [ 51. In addition, picornavims infection results in the specific inhibition of host cell translation [6] . This observation indicated that viral mRNA translation must be initiated by a mechanism that is different from the cap-dependent scanning mechanism used by cellular mRNAs. Indeed, in 1988, Pelletier and Sonenberg [7] , and Jang et al. [8] showed that the mRNAs of two picomaviruses, poliovirus and encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus, are translated by the unusual mechanism of internal ribosome binding. Specifically, they showed that internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences could be used to create functional dicistronic transcripts [7, 8] . This was the first indication that eukaryotic ribosomes can in principle utilize an initiation mechanism resem-bling the internal initiation mechanism used in prokaryotes.",

It has been argued that dicistronic mRNAs are not conclusive tools to identify IRES elements because one can not be certain that the dicistronic transcript is the only transcript produced [ 141. One can, of course, never conclusively demonstrate a zero concentration of smaller, uncapped transcripts present in cells that mediate translation of the second cistron. However, it is striking that small deletions in IRES elements have been shown to abolish translation of the second cistron in a dicistronic mRNA without inducing a detectable increase in cleavage of the dicistronic mRNA [8,15,16\"].",

This is not really surprising; it is expected that the functional highly structured IRES elements [ 17,181 may be affected by long-range term tiary interactions between the IRES and other parts of a long RNA molecule. This may explain the deleterious effect on IRES function of certain small mutations located outside the IRES element [ 15, 19, 20] . Furthermore, ongoing translation of the first cistron in dicistronic mRNAs may affect the structure of the IRES in a dicistronic context, and thus result in altered translational efficiency of the second cistron. Such From this, and experiments in which additional AUGs were added between the IRES and the initiator AUG, it was concluded that ribosomal subunits bind to the IRES and subsequently scan in a 5' to 3' direction until the next AUG codon is encountered. There is little similar@ between the polioviral/rhinoviral IRESs and those found in the EMC or FMD viruses. It has been found that the EMC and FMD viral IRESs are both located at the initiator AUG codon, suggesting that the ribosomal subunits are recruited directly to the initiator AUG codons in these viruses [ 270,281.",

            "text": "Much work has been devoted to the identification of viral and cellular proteins that mediate ribosome entry to viral IRES elements [ 32,33*,34**]. In particular, two cellular proteins, p52 [35] and p57 [30**, 36, 37] , have been identified by their ability to be crosslinked by ultraviolet light to multiple sites in viral IRES elements. Further functional assays are needed to reveal the role of these proteins in internal initiation. In addition, poliovirus encodes a transactivator protein, 2A, that can stimulate IRES usage [38=*]. More recently, the eukatyotic initiation factor (eIF)-4F has been shown to stimulate translation of the second cistron in a dicistronic mRNA [ 39**,40*]. This finding is intriguing, because eIF-4F, also known as the cap-binding protein complex [2,3], is also involved in cap-dependent translational initiation. Furthermore, there seems to be competition for eIF-4F between the cap-dependent and the cap-independent (by internal ribosome binding) initiation pathways [39**]. It is possible that one of the reasons that poliovirus encodes a function that modifies eIF-4F by proteolytically cleaving the ~220 component of eIF-4F [41] is to alter eIF-4F to enable the viral RNA to compete for it more efftciently. The proteolyzed form of eIF-4F is known to moderately stimulate internal initiation and inhibit cap-dependent translation in vitro [42] . In contrast, EMC virus does not induce the cleavage of the ~220 component of eIF-4F and, therefore, may compete more efficiently with cellular mRNAs for eIF-4F. Two recent reports have described the presence of IRES elements in viruses outside the Picornaviridae family. First, hepatitis C virus (HCV), tentatively assigned to be a flavivirus, contains a 5' NCR whose sequence and predicted secondary structure are more similar to picor-naviral5' NCRs than to the 5' NCRs of RNAs from other Gene expression and differentiation Aaviviwes. Both the poliovirus and the HCV genome contain long 5' NCRs with several AUG triplets, some preceded by oligopyrimidine sequences.\"IXvo studies reported that the 5' NCR of HCV, when placed into the intercistronic spacer of a dicistronic mRN& promoted internal initiation as efficiently as the EMC virus IRES in in vitro translation systems (43.1 (C Wang, P Samow and A Siddiqui, unpublished data). A third study did not find evidence that the HCV 5' NCR could function as an IRES 144.1. In this last study, additional non-viral sequences were present between the HCV 5' NCR and the initiator AUG triplet; thes,e extra sequences could have changed structures in the RNA resulting in an abrogation of a functional IRES (C Wang, unpublished data). An IRES was also discovered in mRNA3 of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus [45**]. The capped mRNA3 is functionally tricistronic encoding 3a, 3b and 3c proteins [45**]. It was argued that 3a is likely to be produced by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism, 3b by a leaky scanning mechanism, in which the 3a initiator AUG is bypassed, and 3c by internal ribosome entry [45**]. The IRES thought to mediate translation of 3c is located within the 3a and 3b coding sequences; the first example of an IRES located within a coding region. It will be very interesting to study the effects of ribosomes engaged in the synthesis of 3a or 3b on IRES usage for 3c translation.",

A 252 nucleotide sequence element in exon D, common to mR-NAs from both transcription units, was found to contain an IRES element [ 1 l**]. Moreover, within this IRES is a 55 nucleotide sequence element that is highly conserved among different Drosophila species [54] .

Upon addition of translation extracts and in the presence of translation elongation inhibitors, an 80s ribosome should form at an AUG codon located downstream of the IRES in such circular RNA molecules. Indeed, preliminary experiments have indicated that intact EMC virus IRES-containing circles sediment at 80s (CY Chen and P Samow, unpublished data). Therefore, circular RNAs should prove to be useful in the elucidation of the mechanism of internal ribosome binding.IPES elements, usually hundreds of nucleotides in length, have been identified in viral genomes from all genera of the Picornaviridae, including poliovirus (genus Enterovims) [7], rhinovirus (genus Rhinovirus) [ 25**], EMC virus (genus Cardiovirus) [8] and foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus (genus Aphthovim) [ 26,27=]. The IRES elements of poliovirus and rhinovirus are very slmilar, located upstream of the AUG initiator codon [ 25**].",
