As a novel way to present antigenic epitopes to the immune system, we have developed icosahedral self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPNs) to serve as a prototypical vaccine platform for infectious diseases. Here we examine some biophysical factors that affect the self-assembly of these nanoparticles, which have as basic building blocks coiled-coil oligomerization domains joined by a short linker region. Relying on in silico computer modeling predictions, we selected five different linker regions from the RCSB protein database that connect oligomerization domains, and then further studied the self-assembly and stability of in vitro produced nanoparticles through biophysical characterization of formed particles. One design in particular, T2i88, revealed excellent self-assembly and homogeneity thus paving the way toward a more optimized nanoparticle for vaccine applications.",

Virus capsids are often composed of just one single polypeptide chain that self-assembles into a proteinaceous cover thus protecting the genomic material of the virion. In light of this information, our design has a single polypeptide chain as the building block that self-assembles into a nanoparticle. Icosahedrons have 5-fold, 3-fold and 2-fold symmetry axes. To mimic icosahedral viruses, two of these axes were included in our design by creating a fusion protein of a pentameric coiled coil that is covalently linked to a trimeric coiled coil. Modeling showed that the superposition of these two oligomerization domains onto the corresponding symmetry axes of the icosahedron and application of the symmetry elements gives rise to a nanoparticle with icosahedral symmetry. Under the right conditions, identical copies of the protein chain self-assemble to produce the nanoparticle.",

            "text": "In a nanoparticle with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry, 60 protein chains form the 20 triangular faces and every chain occupies an identical environment. The requirement of a minimal number of 60 asymmetric units is related to the number of symmetry-related asymmetric units in an icosahedron. With a relatively small deviation from the exact symmetry of a T = 1 icosahedron, more protein chains can be incorporated in a viral capsid. Certain multiples (1, 3, 4, etc.) of 60 subunits are allowed, leading to capsids with 60, 180, 240, \u2026 protein chains. These multiples are referred to as triangulation numbers T = 1, T = 3, T = 4, etc. Thus, in the case of the nanoparticles, it is theoretically possible to accommodate more than one protein subunit in an asymmetric unit to form nanoparticles with T = 3 or T = 4 icosahedral symmetry. However, to achieve this some of the pentameric coiled coils of the fusion protein would have to switch to form a hexamer, which is rather unlikely. According to the viral tiling theory, which includes surface representations in terms of more than one type of building block per particle, 7 it is more likely that such larger assemblies are non-quasi-equivalent pentamer-only capsids, like the capsids of polyoma or papilloma viruses. For this reason, we refer to them as T = 3-like icosahedra in the context of this manuscript.",

            "text": "Initially, we used solid-phase peptide synthesis to produce a peptide chain composed of two oligomerization domains with different oligomerization states joined by a short linker segment. 8 Biophysical characterization of the synthetic peptide nanoparticles showed that they had a diameter of about 16 nm and that there were 60 peptide chains per nanoparticle, in support of a T = 1 icosahedral model. We also showed that when SAPNs were functionalized with a fragment of the surface protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, they were able to elicit conformation-specific antibodies that inhibited infection of cells by SARS viruses in vitro. 9 Likewise, we have made nanoparticles for use as repetitive antigen displays for vaccines against malaria, [10] [11] [12] [13] HIV, 14 toxoplasmosis 15 and influenza. 16 They can also be used for the design of other tools for nano-biotechnological applications. [17] [18] [19] Given the potential of SAPNs as repetitive antigen display systems for the development of vaccines, we next aimed to rationally modify their building blocks in order to affect epitope density. Our goal was to find out what would happen if we modified the short linker region connecting the pentameric and the trimeric oligomerization domains of the fusion protein ( Figure 1 ). This part of the fusion protein is of great importance as the packing of chains in the nanoparticle is governed by the flexibility of the linker region ( Figure 1 ). By decreasing the angular flexibility between the pentamer and the trimer, nanoparticles with 60 or more chains could be obtained. Researchers have long been investigating the effect of linker length and composition when creating a fusion protein. In 2002, George and Heringa developed a linker database intended for the rational design of linkers for domain fusion, 20 and we have previously noted that one of the factors influencing protein assembly into icosahedral nanoparticles is the length of the linker region that connects the two oligomerization domains. 8 Not only the length of the linker but also its composition is crucial. Indeed, Linhult et al. investigated three different linker regions in order to obtain a stable divalent proteinaceous human serum albumin binding ligand under alkaline conditions. 21 They concluded that the length and composition of the linker region was important when connecting two functional domains. In the context of protein design and dynamics, Wriggers et al. highlighted the distinction between flexible, glycine-rich linkers and the more rigid, often helical kind. 22 Missirlis et al. studied a system of peptide amphiphiles where a bioactive peptide was connected to a hydrophobic segment by a linker. 23 By incorporating different linkers, they showed that linker chemistry influenced peptide folding, which in turn impacted the peptide's biofunction. Arai et al. 24 demonstrated the importance of linker rigidity versus flexibility by separating two fluorescent protein domains (EGFP and EBFP) by various types of linkers. Their research showed that FRET was more efficient in flexible, glycine-rich linkers than rigid, helical ones.",

The SAPN T81c-8-pf was selected for the subsequent tests. The construct T81c-8-pf is a prototype malaria vaccine described in detail elsewhere. 11 It contains a modified tryptophan zipper as a pentameric coiled coil connected by two glycine residues to the trimeric coiled coil, which contains a helper T-cell epitope. At the C-terminus a short spacer sequence GGSG connects the nanoparticle core and the B-cell epitope (NANP) 4 from the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum. Our main intention was to understand how the incorporation of different linkers would affect self-assembly of this nanoparticle. To this end, we genetically modified the sequence of the linker region in the construct to include one of the five linker regions obtained from the PDB search. The nanoparticles formed by the three constructs that could be refolded (T1qgt, T2ic8 and T2i88) were biophysically characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS).

The first wash was done with lysis buffer A and the second and third washes were done at pH 6.3 and pH 5.9, respectively, with a buffer containing 9 M urea, 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM imidazole and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Elution was achieved at pH 5.2 and pH 4.5 with 9 M urea, 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 20 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM imidazole and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Protein purity was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following purification, the denatured monomeric polypeptides were refolded using one of the following three methods: (1) dialysis performed in a stepwise manner until 0 M urea was reached (stepwise refolding) (2) dialysis against a buffer with no urea (direct refolding) or (3) concentration (Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices) and dilution to a buffer with no urea (quick refolding). The proteins were filtered with a 0.1 \u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter before and after dialysis (Milipore #SLVV 033 RS).",

In the original PDB structure (human hepatitis B virus capsid) this residue is reduced and does not form a disulfide bond that might stabilize protein structure. 20 Likewise for our construct (T1qgt-8-pf) we wanted to prevent the occurrence of disulfide bridges so as to mimic the cysteine's oxidation state in the original PDB structure. Another advantage of a reduced cysteine for our SAPN, is that aggregation caused by intermolecular disulfide bridges would be prevented. Given this knowledge, we included the reducing agent TCEP in the refolding buffer. The buffer used for stepwise removal of urea was 20 mM Tris pH 8.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.1 mM TCEP (reducing agent). High pH and low NaCl concentration were selected because of our research group's successful refolding of constructs containing pan-DR epitope under these conditions. 11, 12 Despite the fact that refolding was performed under reducing conditions there was substantial aggregation caused by unknown interactions (Figure 3, A) . To corroborate self-assembly of the protein in another way, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS), which is a biophysical technique that measures the size and size distribution of molecules in solution.

The construct studied here could also be viewed as a helix-loop-helix polypeptide able to form fibers in the same way. However, in our case the situation is more complex as the helices interact with one another as pentamers and trimers, which would then create sheets of aggregation or other structures that are hard to predict. The fibers formed by these would not be similar to those described by Aili et al. Strings of nanoparticles with a length of 200 nm can be observed in the TEM micrographs (Figure 3, A) . DLS also shows a peak around 200 nm (Figure 3, B) . This is of interest because studies have shown that protein nanofibers can act as self-adjuvanting vaccines in mice 39, 40 T2ic8-8-pf: Linker region with leucine at position 65 of the heptad repeat",

Indeed, this is what we observed in our biophysical characterization ( Figure 5 ). AUC and STEM were carried out to extend this analysis. The results of both of these mass measurement methods support the presence of a prominent species that contains 180 peptide chains per nanoparticle, suggesting the formation of T = 3-like icosahedral particles. Both also indicate a degree of polydispersity, which according to the STEM data may be at least partly due to the association of lower mass species (Figure 7 , inset). The images also show that masses below about 3.5 MDa generally arise from particles with essentially circular projections compatible with a roughly spherical shape.",

Given that it is nearly impossible for a Trp-zipper to change to a hexamer we are left with nanoparticles that are only T = 3-like. We are currently further investigating this topic with tessellation theories. 7 In summary, this work provides insight into the self-assembly of coiled-coil based nanoparticles which can be used for rational vaccine design. By substituting the linker region between the pentamer and trimer with protein sequences from helix-turn-helix motifs from the protein structural database we were able to show how the linker chemistry affected nanoparticle formation. The flexibility in the linker region allows different inter-helical angles, which influences the self-assembly of the nanoparticles. Considering the potential application of nanoparticles as vaccines, the different angles would allow different epitope densities, which may result in distinct immune responses. The database search yielded a new optimized sequence of the core of the particles that meanwhile has been used to design an improved malaria vaccine candidate compared to the one described in references.
