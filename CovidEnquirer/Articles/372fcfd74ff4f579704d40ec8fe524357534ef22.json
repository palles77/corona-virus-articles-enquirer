First, pregnant women are at increased risk for infl uenza-associated illness and death. The effects on the fetus of maternal infl uenza infection, associated fever, and agents used for prophylaxis and treatment should be taken into account. Pregnant women might be reluctant to comply with public health recommendations during a pandemic because of concerns regarding effects of vaccines or medications on the fetus. Guidelines regarding nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., voluntary quarantine) also might present special challenges because of confl icting recommendations about routine prenatal care and delivery. Finally, healthcare facilities need to develop plans to minimize exposure of pregnant women to ill persons, while ensuring that women receive necessary care.",

Pandemics occur infrequently but can be devastating in terms of the effects on illness and mortality. Most infl uenza experts consider infl uenza pandemics inevitable (1) . The emergence of avian infl uenza A virus (H5N1) as a cause of severe human infections has increased concerns about an impending pandemic. Although human disease caused by infl uenza (H5N1) is a rare event (2) , the virus has become endemic among bird populations in some areas of Asia and has continued to spread geographically and to broaden its host range. Concerns that the virus might acquire the ability to effi ciently spread between humans have led public health authorities to accelerate preparations for pandemic infl uenza.",

Types A and B are associated with seasonal epidemics; only type A viruses have caused pandemics. Infl uenza A viruses are further classifi ed on the basis of 2 surface proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Minor mutations that result in subtle changes in these proteins (antigenic drift) occur continuously. Because these mutations produce viruses that can be suffi ciently different antigenically from previous infl uenza viruses, infl uenza vaccines must be updated annually. More dramatic changes in the surface proteins of infl uenza viruses, through mutation of nonhuman (e.g., avian or swine) viruses or reassortment of human and nonhuman viruses, result in the creation of novel human subtypes (termed an-tigenic shift). When novel subtypes that can be effi ciently transmitted among humans emerge within a population that lacks immunity, an infl uenza pandemic can occur (3) .",

In addition, 321 confi rmed human cases of infl uenza (H5N1) in 12 countries have been reported to the World Health Organization, 194 of which have resulted in death (2) . Thus far, infl uenza (H5N1) transmission has been predominantly bird-to-human, but the ongoing avian disease and occasional human disease have raised concerns about the possibility that this virus could gain the capacity for effi cient humanto-human transmission and possibly lead to an infl uenza pandemic (3) . Although infl uenza (H5N1) represents the greatest current threat for a pandemic virus, global public health authorities recommend increased vigilance for any novel infl uenza virus infections in humans as a cornerstone of pandemic preparedness.",

Relevant immunologic alterations also occur during pregnancy, with a shift away from cell-mediated immunity toward humoral immunity.

Among 1,350 reported cases of infl uenza among pregnant women during the pandemic of 1918, the proportion of deaths was reported to be 27% (5) . Similarly, among a small case series of 86 pregnant women hospitalized in Chicago for infl uenza in 1918, 45% died (6) . Among pregnancy-associated deaths in Minnesota during the 1957 pandemic, infl uenza was the leading cause of death, accounting for nearly 20% of deaths associated with pregnancy during the pandemic period; half of women of reproductive age who died were pregnant (7) . Pregnant women have also been shown to be at increased risk for infl uenza complications during interpandemic periods (15) . In a large study of >4,300 women of reproductive age during 19 interpandemic infl uenza seasons, pregnant women were compared with postpartum women (a group considered to be most similar to pregnant women demographically and with regard to their health) and were found to be signifi cantly more likely to be hospitalized for a cardiopulmonary event during the infl uenza season (4). The risk for hospitalization increased as pregnancy progressed, with women at term nearly 5 times more likely to be hospitalized than postpartum women (4) . Similarly, during 3 infl uenza seasons in the late 1970s, rates of medical visits for acute respiratory disease were more than twice as high among pregnant women than nonpregnant women (16) . At particularly high risk during the infl uenza season are pregnant women with underlying medical conditions for which infl uenza vaccination is recommended, such as asthma (17) . On the basis of these data, pregnant women should be considered a population for which special considerations for prevention and treatment for infl uenza need to be made.",

However, even in the absence of fetal viral infection, animal studies suggest that adverse effects can still occur.

            "text": "Adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported following previous infl uenza pandemics. During the infl uenza pandemic of 1918, remarkably high rates of spontaneous abortion and preterm birth were reported (5,6), especially among women with pneumonia (for example, in 1 study, >50% of pregnancies in which the pregnant woman had infl uenza and accompanying pneumonia were not carried successfully to term) (5) . During the Asian infl uenza pandemic of 1957, studies suggested a possible increase in defects of the central nervous system (10) (11) (12) and several other adverse outcomes, including birth defects, spontaneous pregnancy loss, fetal death, and preterm delivery (8) . Studies of the effects of seasonal infl uenza infection on the fetus have been contradictory. A small increased risk for birth defects in general and for specifi c birth defects have been observed in some but not all studies (9) . Using data from a recent case-control study, investigators showed that mothers of infants with any type of birth defect were slightly more likely to report infl uenza during early pregnancy than mothers of control infants (adjusted odds ratio 1.4; 95% confi dence intervals 1.3-1.6), with statistically significant associations for cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and neural tube and congenital heart defects. Verifi cation of maternal report of infl uenza illness with prospectively collected clinical data was possible for similar numbers of case and control infants (9) , which suggests that recall bias was unlikely to explain the association. The risk associated with infl uenza was reduced for women who received treatment with antifever medications and for those who had taken folic acid before and during early pregnancy (9) .",

Even if the infl uenza virus does not have a direct effect on the fetus, fever that often accompanies infl uenza infection could have adverse effects. Both animal and human epidemiologic studies suggest that hyperthermia is associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes (26) , especially neural tube defects (27) .

            "text": "A main component of the public health response to pandemic infl uenza will be nonpharmaceutical interventions to mitigate disease rates and severity and the societal impact of the pandemic beyond health outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released guidance for nonpharmaceutical interventions during a pandemic that focuses on isolation of ill persons, voluntary quarantine of households with ill persons, and social distancing techniques (e.g., avoiding crowded settings, closing schools and child care centers) to limit exposure to ill persons (32) . However, these recommendations present special challenges for pregnant women. For example, pregnant women will need guidance on how to protect themselves from becoming infected (e.g., use of protective devices) if they are quarantined with or directly providing care for ill persons. Responsibilities of pregnant women as members of the workforce and as caregivers of their children and other family members may further complicate their adherence to public health recommendations. In addition, because healthy pregnant women will continue to require both outpatient prenatal care and inpatient delivery services during a pandemic, they might be more likely to be exposed to clinical settings where ill persons are receiving care. Given the potential risk to women in clinical settings, guidance will need to be developed regarding whether some routine prenatal care visits could be omitted. Healthcare facilities need to develop plans to ensure that pregnant women receive necessary care, but with minimal exposure to ill persons or their contacts. In addition, plans for care and delivery of pregnant women with confi rmed infl uenza or recent exposure must ensure that these women receive appropriate care without unduly exposing other healthy pregnant women and their infants to illness. An appropriate strategy to address these issues might include designating a location and staff for care of pregnant women and their newborns, separate from those used by patients with infl uenza. Another strategy could include developing an algorithm that triages pregnant patients on the basis of pregnancy stage and symptoms to ensure that pregnant women most in need of attention receive care, but avoid the risk of infl uenza exposure when that risk might be greater than the benefi t of care. Consideration of these strategies as part of overall community pandemic planning activities will be essential.",

In Toronto, obstetric services were moved into a newly designed facility that had entrances, elevators, and air-handling systems that were separate from the rest of the hospital. Hospital staff, patients, and visitors were screened at the hospital entrance for SARS symptoms and to ensure that they had not visited a SARS-affected area. Staff members wore N95 respirator masks, face shields or eye protection, gowns, and non-latex gloves, and employed frequent hand washing with ethanol-based gels. Patients were limited to 1 visitor during labor and delivery, and no visitors were allowed on postpartum wards. All patients and visitors wore N95 respiratory masks. The length of postpartum stay was decreased and, after discharge, women were instructed to stay at home under quarantine for 10 days; a nurse visited them on their third day postpartum. Healthcare workers were asked to observe work quarantine; they were encouraged to go directly to work and home minimizing contact with the public (34) . In Hong Kong, obstetric services were transferred to a hospital separate from hospitals in which SARS cases were managed. Women were discharged sooner after delivery, and all obstetric services considered nonessential (e.g., routine ultrasonography and prenatal diagnosis) were temporarily suspended (33) .",

Animal studies have shown no evidence of increased risk for adverse effects for either medication (36, 37) , but animal data do not always predict the effects on human pregnancies (35) . Human data are very limited. Among 61 pregnant women exposed to oseltamivir in the post-marketing period, most pregnancies had a normal outcome (36) . Single cases of trisomy 21 and anencephaly were reported among these exposed pregnancies, but these cases were not believed to be causally related to oseltamivir exposure. Three pregnancies were inadvertently exposed to zanamivir during the clinical trials, with one ending in spontaneous abortion, one in elective termination, and one in an outcome with no apparent adverse effects (37) . The bioavailability (the proportion of active drug that reaches the systemic circulation) of zanamivir is lower (12%-17%) than that of oseltamivir (\u224880%) (38) , leading some to suggest that it might be preferred during pregnancy (3).",

Given their increased risk for illness and death during pandemic infl uenza, pregnant women should be considered a high priority for receipt of infl uenza vaccine. Several studies have demonstrated no adverse fetal effects when women received inactivated vaccine during pregnancy (15, 40) . Both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend annual vaccination with trivalent inactivated infl uenza vaccine for women who will be pregnant during the infl uenza season (October-mid May) to prevent seasonal infl uenza (15, 40) . (Live, attenuated, infl uenza virus vaccine, available as an intranasal spray, is not approved for use during pregnancy, given the theoretical risk associated with use of live vaccine during pregnancy.) Inactivated infl uenza vaccine is recommended in all 3 trimesters of pregnancy (15, 40) . Despite these recommendations, compliance has been low (15) , probably because of concerns among women and their healthcare providers regarding the safety of vaccination during pregnancy. Development of culturally and linguistically appropriate messages will be necessary to ensure that pregnant women receive information regarding care required for their health and that of their fetus in the event of a future pandemic. Professionals who develop these messages need to be aware that some women will have limited access to healthcare services. Innovative strategies will be needed to ensure that these messages reach them.",

Research into the effects of maternal infl uenza and its treatment on the pregnant woman and her fetus is sorely needed. Based on the limited information available, pregnant women who become ill with infl uenza should be treated aggressively with antifever therapy, and should adhere to standard recommendations for folic acid consumption (9) . Given the limited data currently available, plans for prophylaxis and treatment for pandemic infl uenza will need to include reassessment of risks of infl uenza and risks and benefi ts of treatment strategies as a pandemic evolves. In addition to incorporating considerations specifi c to preg-nant women into pandemic infl uenza planning efforts, strategies to communicate this guidance to pregnant women and their healthcare providers must be planned, developed, and tested. Only through consideration of all these issues, from research and planning to communications and intervention, will the health and well-being of pregnant women be ensured in a future infl uenza pandemic.",
