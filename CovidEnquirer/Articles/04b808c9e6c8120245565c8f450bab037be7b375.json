Even in the absence of perforation, microorganisms from the gut lumen may cause local abscessation and secondary septic peritonitis in which there is intermingling of suppuration, granulation tissue, and tumor cells. Based on studies carried out prior to revision of the nomenclature, tumors in cecum and colon, where gastrointestinal stromal tumors predominate, were determined to have a relatively high metastatic risk. They may metastasize to the mesenteric nodes, mesentery, and liver, but in general, these tumors have a more favorable prognosis after complete resection than other malignant neoplasms of the lower gastrointestinal tract.",

Most are encountered incidentally, at surgery, meat inspection, or necropsy, but tumors of this type, or previously diagnosed as leiomyomas, may cause intermittent bouts of colic that become more frequent with time. They occur in the stomach, small intestine, and most frequently in the cecum and colon, as encapsulated, moderately firm, multinodular, pale tan, or hemorrhagic masses in the muscularis or subserosa, protruding on the serosal surface, or rarely, as somewhat pedunculated tumors projecting from the serosa or into the lumen.

There is usually fecal staining on the perineum, but a rare acute case may dehydrate without significant diarrhea. Scouring animals may continue to suck during the early phase of their illness, a milk clot or curd may be present in the stomach, and internal fat depots may be adequate. Animals that lose interest in feed due to more chronic disease, and those taken off nutrients, may have serous atrophy of fat and appear cachectic. The small intestine is flaccid, dilated, and often thinwalled, and fluid content is present throughout the full length ( Fig.  1.83 ). The content is usually watery and clear green-yellow. It often separates into two phases, the more solid of which appears to consist of small masses of clotted milk or mucus. Sometimes the content is more homogeneous and creamy in texture. In animals examined some time after spontaneous death, this appearance is due to postmortem slough of epithelium. The large intestine similarly contains fluid, creamy or pasty content, usually white or yellow. The mucosa of the small intestine may appear glistening and mildly congested; that in the large intestine is usually unremarkable.The forestomachs in ruminants that have been tube-fed, or in which the reticular groove has apparently failed to close, may contain sour fermented milk or milk replacer and the mucosa may be mildly reddened.The abomasal mucosa of some calves may contain scattered focal stressassociated hemorrhages.

Salmonellosis in foals may be seen as fatal diarrhea with few gross lesions, or as fibrinous enterocolitis and septicemia, similar to that seen in older horses. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with occasional gram-positive infections, are common causes of neonatal septicemia, predisposed by failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulin. Fibrinonecrotic enterocolitis in foals under a week of age may be due to Clostridium pe~ringens type B or C, or C. dijllcile. Rhodococcus equi may cause chronic diarrhea and wasting in foals. Pyogranulomatous ulcerative lesions of the large bowel, and purulent mesenteric lymphadenitis, often associated with chronic purulent bronchopneumonia, are characteristically found in R. equi infection. Enterococcus (Streptococcus) durans, an enteroadherent coccus, has been associated with diarrhea in foals. Moderate atrophy of villi covered with adherent gram-positive cocci is characteristic; the large bowel is not colonized. Strongyloides westeri is capable of causing diarrhea in young foals occasionally. Tyzzer's disease, which is restricted to foals under about 6 weeks of age, may be associated with diarrhea. However, the liver lesion dominates the pathologic picture. Enteritis is often not grossly recognized in the small bowel at necropsy of animals with intestinal helminthosis. The pathologist needs, therefore, to have a high index of suspicion to come to a diagnosis in some cases. To make a firm diagnosis of intestinal helminthosis it is necessary to demonstrate substantial populations of nematodes by worm count in intestinal content or digests, and ideally to observe villus atrophy in tissue sections of infected intestine. These findings should be associated with a compatible syndromein the case of Ostertagia, Strongyloides, and the intestinal trichostrongyles, inefficient weight gain or wasting, and usually diarrhea.

The main helminth species causing this syndrome are Ostertagia, Nematodirus, and Trichostrongylus.The genera and species involved vary with the geographic area and climate, and perhaps seasonally, as well as with the age group and other local epizootiologic factors. Larval paramphistomes will also cause enteritis in lambs in enzootic areas. Strongyloides may affect lambs up to several months of age, even those held in confinement.Where it occurs, Nematodirus is usually a disease of lambs 1-3 months of age. Trichostrongylosis usually affects lambs 3 months to yearling age. Oesophagostomum columbianum may cause significant disease in sheep, as well as causing nodule formation in the intestinal submucosa. Trichuris typhlitis is an uncommon problem in sheep, as is Chabertia infection of the colon. Bunostomum and especially Haemonchus cause marked anemia and hypoproteinemia without diarrhea. Hemonchosis is a particular problem in lambs and kids at pasture or held in semiconfinement in warm humid climates. It is also important in ewes and does during the postparturient period, or spring, when retarded larvae emerge synchronously from the abomasal mucosa, and mature.",

Subsequent to the first round of replication, there is widespread viremic dissemination to surface epithelium, with subsequent development of lesions in sites of mechanical or physiologic stress, such as oral and pedal epithelium, or teats in lactating animals. FMDV probably gains entry to these areas via Langerhans cells, with replication in a contiguous group of cells in the stratum spinosum. The resulting cellular degeneration and lysis result in an epidermal vesicle, which is the hallmark of the disease.",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (coronavirus 777) infection is similar to TGEV infection. Nongroup A rotaviruses, antigenically distinct from group A Rotavirus, produce similar lesions experimentally; group B cause epithelial syncytia, in addition. Adenovirus infection, most commonly evident as intranuclear inclusion bodies in epithelium on the dome over Peyer's patch in tissue sections, may be implicated as a cause of villus atrophy in occasional cases. Enteroviruses, astroviruses, and calicivirus have poorly defined significance as pathogens in piglets, though a calici-like virus causes villus atrophy in gnotobiotic pigs. Cryptosporidium infects the large and small intestine in swine, where it seems to play a minor role as an enteric pathogen. Salmonella and Klebsiella, though rarely implicated as pathogens, can cause villus atrophy and diarrhea in neonatal pigs, and some strains ofE. coli with the same capacity are rarely encountered.",

The emergence of Clostridium di~cile as a pathogen of food animats. and consumption of mustard seed or superphosphate fertilizer may cause acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.Acute diarrhea and enterocolitis, sometimes hemorrhagic, may be caused by adenovirus infection in calves and feeder animals. Coccidiosis in calves over 3 weeks of age and older cattle usually causes dysentery and fibrinohemorrhagic typhlocolitis. Winter dysentery, an erosive colitis caused by Bovine coronavirus infection, is only occasionally fatal. Diarrhea due to grain overload is associated with lesions of chemical rumenitis and usually with a history or evidence of excess carbohydrate intake.with segmental jejunal mucosal necrosis and hemorrhage, and functional or mechanical obstruction of the gut causing severe abdominal discomfort of sudden death, is discussed with Clostridium pe~ingens type A, with which it has been circumstantially associated. parasitism may be associated with acute or chronic diarrhea and wasting in calves and young cattle at pasture.The nematode fauna is usually mixed, but certain genera ofhelminths may dominate in particular epizootiologic circumstances. Most important is Ostertagia, which causes abomasitis with mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia. Intestinal nematodes such as Strongyloides and Nematodirus may cause diarrhea in calves at pasture or in semiconfinement. Trichostrongylus and Cooperia in adequate numbers are commonly pathogenic for pastured animals. Toxocara vitulorum may have some significance in warm climates.",
