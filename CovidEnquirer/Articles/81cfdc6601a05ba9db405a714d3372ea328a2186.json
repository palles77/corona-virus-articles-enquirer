Edward Jenner first reported this when herpetic infections were observed to cross-protect against the subsequent development of vaccinia lesions [2] . Then, in the 1950s, Isaacs and Lindenmann discovered the role of interferons in viral interference [3] . Since then, cross-protection has been observed for animal viruses [2] , with possible mechanisms elaborated on in multiple animal models [4] [5] [6] . In human populations, time-series analyses have demonstrated how epidemics involving a particular virus influence the temporality of epidemics involving other families of respiratory viruses [7] [8] [9] [10] . Several case-control and cross-sectional studies also show that co-detection of respiratory viruses is less frequently observed than if the infections caused by different respiratory viruses occur independently of each other [11] [12] [13] . However, evidence from studies of sequential infections in humans would provide more-robust evidence that viral infections can reduce the risk of subsequent infection with a different group of viruses and clarify whether such cross-protective effects differ between different types of viruses.",

A subsequent increase in the incidence of adenovirus infections appeared, at least from time-series data, to account for some degree of replacement for the influenza virus infections averted through vaccination [15] . In this article, we set out to clarify the relationship between specific prior viral infections and subsequent FRI episodes in young Singaporean men undergoing basic military training (BMT). We reanalyzed the Singapore Armed Forces FRI surveillance program data by using survival analyses to assess whether there was any evidence, at the individual level, that infection with particular viruses was conferring short-lived relative cross-protection against subsequent FRI episodes, including those caused by other virus groups.",

BMT is tailored to the physical, medical, and vocational needs of a recruit. The majority enlist into the main intake types, with standard durations of around 9, 17, and 19 weeks, with a small proportion having a mix of shorter courses (termed \"others\"). Dropout rates are low, and our study clinic served most of the healthcare needs for recruits at the training center. We were hence able to reanalyze the individual FRI episodes as a cohort study by linking consultation episodes through coded subject identifiers. The first FRI episode (FRI-1) for a given participant served as the point of entry into the study (t 0 ). Individual participants then accumulated follow-up time ( Figure 1A) , with subsequent FRI episodes being the event of interest. Those with no further episodes accumulated follow-up time until their exit date from BMT, while participants with \u22652 episodes contributed additional follow-up intervals after each subsequent episode.",

Since FRI episodes are concentrated differentially during a BMT course, we adjusted for this effect using the FRI incidence rate during successive 2-weekly phases after the time of enlistment for that intake type ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Materials). Observation time was split into subintervals if the observation period straddled different BMT phases and was analyzed in a multilevel modeling framework ( Figure 1C ). The framework included random effects terms for the BMT companies that participants belonged to, within which were nested the intervals (delineated by consecutive FRI episodes), within which, in turn, were nested the subintervals straddling BMT phases (levels 4 to 1 for model 2). Models 1 and 3 only had 3 levels. Model 1 omitted the subintervals used to adjust for FRI incidence. Model 3, which stratified subintervals by whether they ended <4 weeks or \u22654 weeks after the initial FRI episode, used only the first FRI episode for each participant (episode BMT phase, wk Figure 1 .

In scenario 1 (no subsequent FRI episode), a participant accumulates follow-up time from the first FRI episode (FRI-1) to the date of exit from basic military training (BMT). In scenario 2, follow-up time accrues between the first (FRI-1) and second (FRI-2) episodes (interval A, level was therefore redundant). Models 2 and 3 adjusted for FRI incidence rates by time from enlistment and, hence, excluded the BMT intake type termed \"other\" (for which data used to estimate incidence rates were unavailable).",

Among the viruses, protective effects were strongest following AdV and FluV episodes. AdV infections conferred protection against subsequent infection with AdV and crossprotection to other groups of commonly circulating viruses in BMT (CoV, ERV and FluV), while FluV infection conferred significant protection against subsequent AdV infection. The observation of influenza's protection against subsequent episodes of influenza (mostly due to other types/subtypes in our data, in the period prior to routine TIV administration) is also consistent with reports by other human and animal model studies [6, 20, 21] . Previous time-series analyses have demonstrated viral interference after accounting for seasonal factors, suggesting that epidemics of influenza virus and rhinovirus infection tend to shift the timing of epidemics for other viruses [8] . Others have used case-control-type analyses of codetection data to demonstrate that rhinovirus infection, as an exposure, was inversely associated with the probability of observing adenovirus [12] and influenza virus infections, with the latter 2 viral infections framed as the outcomes of interest [12, 13] . However, in a study of military recruits in which adenovirus was the dominant FRI agent, Wang et al used a case-control analysis to demonstrate the reverse phenomenon-that adenovirus infection as an exposure reduced the odds of rhinovirus infection as the outcome of interest [11] . However, they noted how another interpretation of their results is that rhinovirus infection reduced the risk of subsequent adenovirus infection. The opposing framing of outcomes and exposures in these codetection studies highlights issues in interpreting results from such cross-sectional and casecontrol designs, in which the sequence of infections cannot be ascertained. What distinguishes this work is our use of a cohort study design by which we can identify the temporality and sequence of initial and subsequent FRI episodes, which the previous studies could not do. Observations positive for a specific virus group are essentially being compared against those negative for all viruses we tested for. Therefore, this analyses does not assess whether, for example, infections by the ERV group confers any protection relative to individuals who did not recently have any viral infection. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 suggest that, relative to enlisted recruits for the main BMT intake types, incidence rates for subsequent FRI episodes were higher over the full course duration and for 19-week BMT intake types, respectively. This applied to all virus groups except AdV and FluV groups and was possibly due to confounding by common risk factors for repeated FRIs at the individual level [15] . However, in the shortest, 9-week BMT type and when censoring the data at shorter periods after enlistment, incidence rates were reduced for most virus groups relative to the average rates for recruits following enlistment. For FRI episodes as a whole, incidence rate ratios were 0.49 (95% CI, .29-.77; P < .001) in the data censored 4 weeks after enlistment (Supplementary Table  1 ). These observations therefore suggest that viral causes of FRI other than AdV and FluV may also confer short, time-limited protection. They also corroborate findings from Table 3 on how a reduced hazard of a subsequent FRI episode occurs in the first 4 weeks following the initial FRI episode, relative to latter periods, and how FluV is more strongly protective during the former period. The difference between the viruses may thus be one of degree, with most viruses conferring some weak, timelimited protection, with the stronger effects from adenovirus and influenza virus becoming apparent when aggregating data over the full course duration. One mechanism consistent with such short-lived cross-protection is the triggering of interferonstimulated genes and cytokines, causing nearby cells in the respiratory tract to enter an antiviral state [22, 23] . Alternatively, transient cross-protection could result from infection-induced behavioral changes, such as improved hand hygiene following an FRI and a short duration of reduced exposure to new pathogens while being furloughed on home leave. However, this on its own is likely inadequate to explain the extent of cross-protection observed with adenovirus and influenza virus infections relative to other FRI episodes. Other proposed mechanisms, such as competition for the same receptor-binding sites and intracellular host machinery for replication [24] , and an unfavorable physiological state of the host, such as high body temperatures upon an initial infection [11] , are more applicable to protection against coinfections but not, as demonstrated here, against sequential infection.",

They provide an explanation for what has previously been suspected on the basis of time-series analyses, such as how influenza epidemics potentially delay RSV epidemics [8, 25] . They also add to the body of evidence motivating the search for the causative mechanisms for cross-protection among viral infections while providing additional clues. Given the relative ranking of virus families in conferring cross-protection, we suggest focusing the search for mechanisms on common factors induced by both adenovirus and influenza virus. Notably, our previous studies suggest that infections with these 2 infections may be more severe, because they are more likely to present with febrile illness [26] and higher temperatures (\u226538\u00b0C) than infections due to other common circulating virus families [16] . This again supports a cytokine-mediated antiviral effect. Finding a means to induce such cross-protection without severe side effects could potentially lead to interventions that may be particularly useful in the context of exposure to dangerous viruses for which there is no specific vaccine or antiviral agent [27] .",
