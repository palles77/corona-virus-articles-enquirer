No study to date has examined the presentation of ACS in the prehospital setting. Our goal was to examine circadian, day-of-week, and age patterns of occurrence in ACS in a large, urban emergency medical services (EMS) system. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic prehospital medical records from the Beijing's EMS system spanning August 1, 2005, to July 31, 2007. Data were analyzed by hour of the day and day of the week. \u03c7 2 tests were performed to compare the difference. Results: Seven thousand thirty-two cases of ACS were identified by the EMS system physicians during the 2-year study period, including 536 cases of acute myocardial infarction. A significant variation of circadian distribution of ACS was observed in both 24-hour (P b .001) and 2-hour (P b .001) interval time course. Two peaks were observed in the morning from 0800 to 1000 and approaching midnight from 2200 to 2400. Increases of 50% and 60.8% in the morning and evening peaks were found, respectively, when compared with the early morning baseline (nadir). No significant difference was found among the accumulated cases in 2 years on each day in a week (P = .203). Conclusions: Our study shows that, in the Beijing metropolitan area, the presentation of ACS has significant circadian rhythm characterized by 2 peaks within 24 hours, the morning peak is 0800 to 1000, and the late evening peak is 2200 to 2400. No significant weekly rhythm was observed in the present study.",

For the past 50 years, in-hospital studies on the circadian rhythm of ACS have been performed, suggesting there are significant circadian rhythms of the incidence of ACS [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . No study to date, however, has examined the presentation of ACS in the prehospital setting. We examined data from the emergency medical services (EMS) system in Beijing, China. Our goal was to examine circadian, day-of-week, and age patterns of occurrence in ACS in an EMS system.

Emergency medical services system physicians enter clinical data on standardized forms, including the patients' general information, chief complaint, medical history, bedside physical examination, and a preliminary diagnosis. In this study, the electronic prehospital medical records from the Beijing's EMS system spanning August 1, 2005, to July 31, 2007, were reviewed by 2 emergency attending physicians. Acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed by EMS system physicians in the prehospital setting, based on symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and the patient's prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram. Physicians reviewing the charts for purposes of this study did not seek to agree or disagree with the diagnosis so long as all the required data were present on the EMS system run sheets.",

The MONICA project monitors the prevalence of acute cardiac events in 21 countries, including China [6, 7] . Data from the case records including age, sex, date, time of onset of ACS, and the diagnosis were extracted for the present study. Cases were grouped in intervals by decade from the age of 20 to 89 years, with one group including all patients older than 89 years. Demographic data (in the year of 2006) of population ratio of age groups and sex groups were obtained from the Web site of Beijing Statistical Information Net (http://www.bjstats.gov.cn/tjnj/ 2006-tjnj/). Data were analyzed by hour of the day and day of the week. \u03c7 2 test was performed to evaluate the distribution variation during the day or the week, and P b .05 was taken as the statistically significant level. All analyses were carried out with the software Statistical Package for Social Sciences 11.5 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Adjusted frequency, corresponding to relative ACS frequency in unit population of the age group, was calculated by the following equation: adjusted frequency = cases of the age group/population ratio of the age group (%)/100.",

Most residents are the Han ethnic population accounting for about 95% of the population. During the study period, there were no significant social events (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, the Olympic Games) that could lead migration or other significant changes in the composition of the population in Beijing. In previous Sino-MONICA census on the population aged 25 to 74 years old (471 462 people in 7 districts of Beijing were surveyed in 1997), acute coronary events have an incidence of about 178 per 100 000 people per year in Beijing [9] . Our identified ACS cases have a similar age distribution as the acute coronary events identified in the Beijing Sino-MONICA project.",

In the past, the morning peak circadian variation has been tracked using pain estimation and creatine kinase-MB to estimate timing [3] . Fries et al [4] confirmed the finding that there was a circadian variation in the onset of AMI with a morning (0600-1200) peak. The reason for a morning peak has been elucidated in various studies. First, there is a morning increase in plasma catecholamine, and serum cortisol levels can increase the direct sympathetic overactivity in the morning hours, which may also enhance myocardial demand [10, 11] . Second, an increase in sympathetic tone occurring on awaking causes increases in blood pressure, heart rate, coronary tone, and myocardial contractility, which singly or together may result in a substantial augmentation of myocardial oxygen consumption [12, 13] . Finally, the increased tendency of ACS in the morning can be explained by several mechanisms including increase in platelet aggregation and activation of the clotting system due to a decrease in fibrinolytic and antithrombin \u0428 activity [14] . A combination of all these factors may possibly explain the cardiac events occurring more frequently in the morning hours. Atherosclerotic plaques may rupture from rapid and large changes of mechanical stresses on awakening in the morning.",

Although not significant, our study shows that the incidence is higher on Friday and not on Monday in Beijing. This may be explained as follows: (1) When Friday comes, people have been exhausted by their work for 5 days. The accumulated work load during a week could be an important factor for ACS. (2) The home gathering of the Chinese people, especially city dwellers, usually occurs on the weekend. The aged people may experience more excitement than on other days in a week.
