Neuropathological examination showed a marked inflammatory reaction in the cerebral leptomeninges and the grey matter of the brain. In the white matter, the reaction was moderate. The changes consisted of perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells and neuronal damage. The brain stem (thalamus, mesencephalon, caudal colliculus) was most severely affected. The spinal cord and its leptomeninges were involved to a lesser degree. The histopathological picture as well as the laboratory findings suggests a viral cause of the disease. The morphology of the disease and serological as well as immunohistochemical results indicate that this disorder is different from previously known feline viral encephalitides.",

            "text": "Feline non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis comprises a group of diseases which apparently are related. The syndrome seems to be geographically widespread since cases have been reported from Australia (Borland and McDonald, 1965) , the United States (Vandevelde and Braund, 1979) and Switzerland (Hoff and Vandevelde, 1981) . Suspected cases have also been recorded in Morocco (Martin and Hintermann, 1952) and Sri Lanka (McGaughey, 1953) . A similar clinical condition affects lions, tigers and other large cats (Flir, 1973; Melchior, 1973; Gutter, Wells and Baskin, 1983; Truyen, Stockhofe-Zurwieden, Kaaden and Pohlenz, 1990 ). In 1974, Kronevi, NordstrGm, Moreno and Nilsson reported the occurrence in Sweden of a feline neurological disorder with the histological features of a non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis. Thirty cats were affected, seven of which were examined post .mortem. These showed, throughout the brain and spinal cord, mononuclear perivascular cuffing, gliosis and meningitis. The lesions were most pronounced in the brain stem. The authors thought the disease was a specific entity, but did not express an opinion as to its aetiology. Serological screening for viral agents was not performed by Kronevi et al. (1974) and efforts to isolate a virus yielded negative results.",

Cats previously shy became social and affectionate, mewing more than usual, while cats that were customarily cheerful and affectionate became introverted and shy. Aggressive behaviour was rare. Depression, loss of appetite and dehydration were seen in many cases. Less frequent signs included pruritus, hypersensitivity to sound and light, increased salivation, impaired vision, staring gaze, hyperaesthesia, constipa- tion, tremor, circling and seizures. The rectal temperature was measured in 19 cats. Nine of these (47.4 per cent) were febrile ( > 39*5\"C). In the final stages of the disease the hindlegs were paralysed. All cats remained conscious to the end. Most cats were treated with antimicrobial drugs such as tetracycline, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Intravenous fluids and B-vitamins were administered in many cases. Some cats were given corticosteroids. Despite treatment, the condition of the cats deteriorated and most cats had to be killed after 1 to 4 weeks illness. Two cats were severely ill from the onset of the disease and had to be put down in less than a week. A few cats recovered incompletely. The only cat who died naturally of the disease did so after 4 weeks.",

It is not known whether these viruses naturally infect domestic cats, but there are no reported cases in the literature. Keane, Parent and Little (1987) inoculated one cat intracerebrally and six cats intravenously with Powassan virus of the Flavivirus serogroup. None of the cats developed neurological signs although histological lesions of a nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis were observed in two cats. Tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) of the Flavivirus group is transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus in Sweden. Most of the cats of the present study were allowed to roam freely outdoors in regions harbouring Ixodes ricinus and there is a possibility that this tick could be the vector of the aetiological agent causing staggering disease. However, cats with staggering disease have tested negative for antibodies to TBEV, which indicates that this virus and probably other related viruses of the Flavivirus serogroup can be excluded as the primary cause of the disease.",

The clinical as well as the histopathological picture in these large cats closely resembled that of our cats. Many lions became more affectionate and infantile and assumed a strange staring gaze. This increased affection, a phenomenon often observed in staggering disease, is not reported as a conspicuous feature of any of the known feline infectious CNS disorders; neither is it mentioned in the other reports of feline meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology cited above. The histological features in the lions and tigers were those of non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis, with the most severe lesions in the brainstem. Efforts to isolate virus from the CNS failed. In recent years, a further outbreak of the disease was observed in the same park (Truyen et al., 1990) . Attempts to isolate a virus from the CNS again failed, but feline herpes virus type 1 (FHV-1) was isolated from the tonsil of one lion. This was interpreted as an infection superimposed on the encephalomyelitis as a result of reduced resistance and was not regarded as the primary cause of the disease.",

Kittens are more severely affected by FHV-1 than adult cats, while staggering disease has not been observed in cats younger than 6 months.

Viral infection is the most likely cause of staggering disease. The possibility of an arthropod-borne mode of transmission has been suggested. Given the consideration that most cats were freely roaming outdoors, rodents could be alternative sources of infection since they are the hosts of some neurotropic viruses, e.g. Theiler's virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Another possible mode of transmission may be through bites and scratches exchanged between cats in fights over territory. Inoculation by bite wounds has been shown to be the major mode of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and the fact that male cats are more often affected by staggering disease than females gives some support to the theory that staggering disease could be transmitted by bites in a similar way.",
