Disinsection is not routinely done on incoming flights to the United States. Although disinsection, when done appropriately, was declared safe by the WHO in 1995, there is still much debate about the safety of the agents and methods used. Guidelines for disinsection have been updated for the revised International Health Regulations (www2a.cdc.gov/phlp/docs/58assembly.pdf). Many countries, including the United States, reserve the right to increase the use of disinsection in case of increased threat of vector or disease spread. An updated list of countries that require disinsection and the types of methods used are available at the U.S. Department of Transportation website: (http://ostpxweb.ost.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.htm).",

The CDC and USDA import restrictions allow U.S.-origin pet birds to return following quarantine for 30 days at a USDA facility. CDC and USDA allow import of processed bird products that have been rendered noninfectious. These products must be accompanied by a USDA permit and government certification confirming that the products were treated according to USDA requirements.",
