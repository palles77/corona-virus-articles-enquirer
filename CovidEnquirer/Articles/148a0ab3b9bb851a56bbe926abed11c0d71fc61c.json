[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Major enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in weanling puppies are canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2), 12 the Cystoisospora ohioensis-complex, Cystoisospora canis, 13 and Giardia duodenalis. 14 Co-infections by these enteropathogens are frequently reported in puppies. 4, 5 Several diagnostic tests (such as PCR, antigen testing by ELISA, and fecal examination) must be combined for accurate diagnosis in cases of diarrhea in weanling puppies. However, the use of such routine testing can be difficult and expensive.",

            "text": "In young children with gastroenteritis, several fecal markers are used to assess shedding of enteropathogens excreted, and to evaluate intestinal inflammation or local immunity. 15 Calprotectin and immunoglobulin A (IgA) are 2 of these markers. Calprotectin is a heterodimeric protein complex mainly present in neutrophils, monocytes, and reactive macrophages. In humans, fecal calprotectin concentrations were reported to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls. 16, 17 Moreover, they also correlated with disease severity as quantified by endoscopy and histologic examination of biopsy specimens. 18 In adult dogs with chronic diarrhea, significantly higher serum and fecal calprotectin concentrations have been reported compared to healthy dogs. 19, 20 Sensitivity and specificity of fecal calprotectin for discriminating adult dogs with severe chronic diarrhea (Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index [CCECAI] \u2265 12) from dogs with mild to moderate clinical signs (CCECAI < 12) were 53 and 92%, respectively, when a cut-off value of 49 lg/g was used. 19 Secretory IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin subtype present in secretions, protecting mucosal surfaces from infectious agents. Therefore, fecal IgA concentration may serve as a marker of mucosal immunity. 21 In dogs, fecal secretory IgA concentrations previously have been used to evaluate intestinal immunity. 22, 23 For interpretation of fecal IgA and calprotectin concentrations, how they are affected by physiological factors such as breed size or age must be taken into account. The canine species is characterized by large interbreed variations, primarily by stature. The digestive physiology of dogs is also known to differ slightly according to breed size. In large breed dogs, such as German shepherds or Great Danes, fecal moisture content is higher, soft stools are more frequent and the number of defecations is higher than in small breed dogs. 7, 10, 11, 24 This difference may be a result of lower mineral absorption, higher fermentative activity reflecting higher intestinal permeability and a longer transit time, or both. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] The same variation has been described in puppies, with large breed puppies having feces of lower consistency compared to small breed puppies. 6 Age also affects concentrations of markers. Indeed, lower fecal IgA concentrations were described in puppies <6 months of age compared to adult dogs. 31, 32 In humans, an effect of age on fecal calprotectin concentration has been described with higher concentrations being observed in healthy children compared to healthy adults. 33 The same variation has been described between healthy puppies and healthy adults, but these results were obtained from dogs housed in the same breeding kennel. 32 Therefore, the aims of our study were to determine if calprotectin and IgA are influenced by fecal moisture (Study 1) and to evaluate if these fecal markers can be useful to detect infection by an enteropathogen (virus, parasite, or both) in puppies, taking into account the effect of 2 potential biases, age and breed size (Study 2).",

For each puppy, fecal consistency was evaluated by a single operator using a 13-point scale, based on the texture and shape of the feces (from liquid to hard and dry). 6 Fresh feces were collected and weighed for each dog. If the stool volume defecated was sufficient (\u226515 g), stools were separated into 3 aliquots, 1 for fecal moisture evaluation and 2 for measurement of fecal calprotectin and IgA concentrations. Water content of the stools was determined by weighing feces before and after lyophilization. 30 Calprotectin and IgA were quantified by inhouse radioimmunoassays after extraction, as previously described. 22, 32, 34 All samples were analyzed using the same batch of tracer and reagents.

Puppies vaccinated within the preceding 10 days before the visit and puppies with clinical signs of weakness, dehydration, or anorexia were not included in the study. However, puppies with an abnormal fecal quality were included in the study. Each puppy was identified by a colored collar and its age and breed were recorded. Depending on the mean adult body weight of their respective breed, puppies were categorized into small breed size or large breed size as described above. For each puppy, fecal consistency was evaluated by a single operator using a 13-point scale as previously described. 6 Based on growth rate deterioration, thresholds for abnormal feces in puppies were previously validated and appeared to vary with breed stature and age. 6 Briefly, feces with a score \u22645 were classified as abnormal for large breed puppies regardless of age. For small breed puppies, fecal scores \u22646 and \u22647 were classified as abnormal for 4-5 week old puppies and for older puppies between 6 and 8 weeks old respectively.",

Variables examined included age of puppies (5-6/7-8/9-11 weeks of age), breed size (small/large), fecal quality (normal/abnormal), G. inestinalis, C. ohioensis complex, C. canis, Toxocara canis, CPV2, and CCV shedding (yes/no), shedding of \u22651virus (yes/no), shedding of \u22651parasite (yes/no), and shedding of \u22651 enteropathogen (yes/no). In a second step, relationships between shedding of enteropathogens and fecal marker concentrations were evaluated in 3 different linear mixed models for each marker. In a first linear mixed model, effects of each pathogen (shedding of each pathogen [yes/no]) on either marker were evaluated. In a second linear mixed model, influence of the type of enteropathogens (shedding of \u22651 parasite [yes/no] and shedding of \u22651 virus [yes/no]) on either fecal marker was evaluated.

            "text": "Diarrhea is common in puppies around the time of weaning, and may be accompanied by slowed growth of the puppies. 6 Viral and parasitic infections are very common in young puppies and are involved in weanling diarrhea. 5, 6, 14, [41] [42] [43] The early detection of such infections would avoid growth retardation and could decrease the development of more severe forms of the disease. Thus, noninvasive markers of digestive health, the concentrations of which might be modified by the presence of enteropathogens, would be of great utility in these patients. Thus, our study investigated 2 fecal markers, calprotectin and IgA, used in human pediatric gastroenterology for their utility in weanling puppies. In our study, puppies that shed \u22651 enteropathogen had significantly lower fecal IgA concentrations than did puppies without any enteropathogen shedding identified. This lower fecal IgA concentration may be a cause or a consequence of the enteropathogen shedding. Immunoglobulin A can actively bind microrganisms, enterotoxins, and other antigens, and prevent adherence and subsequent penetration of the intestinal wall. Thus, a lower fecal IgA concentration could be caused by IgA being utilized in antigen binding or by enterohepatic recirculation of IgA. After IgA binds an antigen in the intestinal lumen, it is either excreted in the feces or is actively reabsorbed for destruction of the microorganism or virus by hepatic Kuppfer cells. Reabsorption of IgA could have been increased by an infection with an enteropathogen, which could result in decreased fecal concentrations of IgA. Conversely, the lower fecal IgA concentration also could indicate the presence of altered local immunity and thus serve as evidence for a higher risk of infection with an enteropathogen. A positive impact of fecal IgA on protection against infectious diseases already has been described in other species. Mice lacking secretory IgA exhibit a significant delay in clearance of rotavirus infection compared with mice that have secretory IgA. 44 In children, fecal IgA concentrations also were shown to have an influence on protection against rotavirus infection and resulting disease. 45 No significant effect of any viral (CCV or CPV2) or parasite shedding (G. duodenalis, C. ohioensis complex, C. canis, or T. canis) on fecal calprotectin concentration was observed. This lack of difference in calprotectin concentrations between dogs that showed enteropathogen shedding and those that did not could be explained by the population of dogs enrolled in our study (ie, healthy puppies or puppies presenting only with an abnormal fecal quality without any other clinical sign). In humans, the patient's clinical status influences the concentrations of this marker. In children who are clinically healthy but infected by Giardia, no effect on fecal calprotectin concentration was described. 33 However, in human patients with viral gastroenteritis, fecal calprotectin concentrations were reported to be associated with the severity of clinical signs. 46 In our study, 18.9% of puppies were found to be excreting a high load of CPV2 but without any of the typical clinical signs (eg, hemorrhagic diarrhea, vomiting, prostration, dehydration, anorexia). This healthy carrier state could explain the lack of association between shedding of this virus and fecal calprotectin concentrations. Another study comparing fecal calprotectin concentrations among healthy puppies, puppies with an abnormal fecal quality, and puppies with clinical parvovirus infection would be needed to further elucidate this relationship.",

            "text": "Fecal moisture in our study ranged from 50 to 77.2% (median, 66.7%), with a negative correlation with fecal scores, which is accordance with previous studies. 10, 30 A negative correlation also was observed between fecal markers and fecal score. The higher IgA and calprotectin concentrations in puppies with liquid or soft feces in this study do not seem to be a direct consequence of stool consistency (dilution) because this negative correlation was observed for fresh feces as well as for concentrations based on fecal dry matter. The negative correlation between fecal score and fecal marker concentration could be explained by the effect of age acting as a confounding factor. Indeed age influence feces quality (lower fecal score in very young puppies) 6 and, at the same time, age influences fecal concentrations of both markers (higher fecal concentrations in very young puppies). 47 Our study indicates that fecal calprotectin concentrations decrease and stabilize with age. This result is in accordance with our longitudinal study performed in young dogs around the age of weaning. 47 In humans, considerably higher fecal calprotectin concentrations also have been observed in infants around the time of birth compared with those in healthy older children and adults. 33, [48] [49] [50] In our study, 17% of puppies had high fecal calprotectin concentrations (>49 lg/g) similar to those observed in adult dogs with inflammatory bowel disease, with large interindividual variations. 19 These high concentrations do not appear to be linked to viral or parasite shedding because this effect of age on fecal calprotectin concentrations was still observed when both variables (age and enteropathogen shedding) were taken into consideration within the same statistical model. Moreover, we previously observed a spontaneous normalization of fecal calprotectin concentrations in healthy puppies during the weaning period. 47 The type of food (eg, natural milk, industrial milk, dry food) may have influenced fecal calprotectin concentrations. Human infants who are exclusively breastfed show significantly higher fecal calprotectin concentrations compared to those receiving a mixed diet. 49, 51 The effect of natural milk may depend on several factors such as hormones (eg, ghrelin, leptin), cytokines and other immunostimulants and growth factors (eg, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte colonystimulating factor), which all contribute to the development of the gastrointestinal immune system. 51 Milk ingestion was not controlled in our study, with puppies having free access to maternal milk. However, from 5 to 8 weeks of age, the proportion of natural maternal milk decreases continuously in a puppie's diet because of physiologic progressive weaning. Developmental processes occurring in the digestive tract during this period of life also could explain the higher fecal calprotectin concentrations. During the first weeks of life, intestinal permeability is higher 52 , which may lead to transepithelial migration of neutrophils, as observed in adults with inflammatory bowel disease. 53 The physiological establishment and stabilization of the gut microbiota also may have an effect on calprotectin release as has been suggested in humans. 54, 55 The higher calprotectin concentrations observed also could be linked to bacterial gastrointestinal infections as described in children. 15, 56 ",
