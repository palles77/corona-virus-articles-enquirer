A 6-week supervised exercise training program was carried out in the physiotherapy department of a university teaching hospital. One hundred and thirty-three patients referred from a SARS Review Clinic solely for physiotherapy were included. Cardiorespiratory fitness (6-minute walk test, Chester Step Test for predicting VO 2max ), musculoskeletal performance (isometric deltoid and gluteal muscles strength, handgrip strength, 1-minute curl-up and push-up tests) and health-related quality of life (SF-36) were measured and evaluated. Patients were assigned randomly to either a control group (standardised educational session about exercise rehabilitation) or an exercise group. After 6 weeks, significantly greater improvement was shown in the exercise group in the 6minute walk test (77.4 m vs 20.7 m, p < 0.001), VO 2max (3.6 ml/kg/min vs 1 ml/kg/min, p = 0.04), and musculoskeletal performance (handgrip strength, curl-up and push-up tests, p < 0.05). Effects on health-related quality of life were not statistically significant. It was concluded that the exercise training program was effective in improving both the cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness in patients recovering from SARS. However, health-related quality of life was not affected by physical training.

These complaints might be related to atelectasis, ongoing alveolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, varying degrees of muscle weakness, or deconditioning. As many of them received short bursts of high dose steroid to prevent immunemediated lung injury during the acute illness, these complaints might be due to prolonged bed-rest, adverse drug effects and residual disease pathology (Decramer et al 1996 , Nakago et al 1999 .",

Physical fitness is defined as the ability to perform occupational, recreational and daily activities without undue fatigue (ACSM 1998) . Cardiorespiratory fitness is related to the ability to perform large muscle, dynamic, moderate-tohigh intensity exercise for prolonged periods. Performance of such exercise depends on the functional status of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems. Muscular fitness has been used to describe the integrated status of muscular strength and muscular endurance (Graves et al 1998) . It has also become increasingly important to review health-related quality of life as an outcome measure for health interventions and SF-36 has been extensively adopted to assess physical and psychological well-being (Schelling et al 2000) .",

As SARS is a recently emerged disease, limited information is available about the rehabilitation of the survivors and their profile of return of physical fitness and health-related quality of life. In 2003, most patients with SARS were given only general advice on medical and personal care upon discharge. Thus, the purpose of the study was to investigate into the effect of a 6-week physical rehabilitation program on the post-discharge SARS patients in improving their physical fitness (cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness) and health-related quality of life. On the basis of a power calculation, it has been estimated that 80 subjects were required to have an 80% statistical power and a 5% significance level of detecting a difference in 6minute walk test distance of 60 metres (Berry et al 1999) .",

The baseline measurements of cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness, and health-related quality of life were conducted at least 2 weeks after the patient had been discharged from the hospital (i.e. 5 weeks after disease onset). No sample size calculation was performed prior to the conduct of study as we aimed to recruit all SARS patients admitted in the Prince of Wales Hospital. However, the sample size of the current study was 133 and adequate to have statistical power and significance level of detecting changes in 6-minute walk test distance as suggested by Berry et al (1999) . Of the 258 SARS patients, 31 (12.0%) were not accessible, and 54 (20.9%) either refused to participate or were found to have abovenormal performances; 2 (0.8%) had died. Finally, 171 (66.3%) patients with subnormal performances with respect to the same age range of healthy subjects were recruited for baseline assessment (Lau et al 2005) . With 38 patients unable to participate in the subsequent training sessions, 133 remained and were allocated randomly to the control or exercise group using computer-generated minimisation (Jensen 1991) . Each patient's particulars were keyed in and the computer program automatically allocated the patient to the group that yielded the smallest imbalance in age, gender, and cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness. The allocation was concealed (that is, the person who recruited subjects and the potential subjects were unaware, at the time subjects agreed to enter the study, of which group they would subsequently be allocated to). Details of the study design and number of subjects recruited throughout the study are provided in Figure 1 .",

For cardiorespiratory training, subjects were asked to perform 30-45 minutes of aerobic exercise (e.g., with an upper/lower limb ergometer, stepper, or treadmill) after a 10-minute warm-up in each session. The initial exercise intensity was based on the result of the Chester Step Test (predicted maximum heart rate) and the ratings of perceived exertion using modified Borg scale (0-10). The training zone and exercise intensity (resistance of ergometer, speed, or inclination of treadmill) were at 60-75% (up to 80-85% for fit subjects) of predicted maximum heart rate and rating of perceived exertion of 4-6/10, progressed accordingly (ACSM 1998). The resistance training consisted of 3 sets of a 10-15 repetition maximum load with a 1-2 minute rest interval, for each large muscle group of upper and lower limbs. Each set of resistance training was fatiguing and progressed by 5-10% increments in each successive session (ACSM 1998).",

There were significant differences in the 6-minute walk distance, VO 2max , handgrip strength, and the curl-up and push-up performances between the two groups. The exercise group showed more improvement than the control group in the 6-minute walk distance (77.4 vs 20.7 m, p < 0.001), VO 2max (3.6 vs 0.97 ml/kg/min, p = 0.04), right handgrip strength (4.7 vs 1.7 kg, p < 0.001), left handgrip strength (4.2 vs 2.2 kg, p = 0.04), and the curl-up (7.1 vs 3.6 repetitionsl, p = 0.01) and push-up (8.6 vs 3.6 repetitions, p < 0.01) performances.

Table 3 shows the predictors (covariates) of physical fitness outcomes and domains in SF-36. The group variable was shown to have significant positive effects on 6-minute walk distance, predicted VO 2max , and deltoid and handgrip strengths, as well as on curl-up and push-up performances. In addition, sex, age, post SARS duration, and resumption to previous work also contributed in different degrees to physical functions outcomes and domains in SF-36. SARS survivors who experienced longer post-SARS duration, and hence a longer delay in starting an exercise program, demonstrated weaker left handgrip strength. Age showed negative correlation to certain domains of health-related quality of life, implying that younger patients showed better role physical (\u03b2 = -0.69, p = 0.05), general health (\u03b2 = -0.42, p = 0.02) and mental health (\u03b2 = -0.32, p = 0.02) than older patients.

The exercise group had 13.1% improvement in the 6-minute walk distance whereas the control group had an increment of only 3.4%. Baseline VO 2max was significantly higher in the control group when compared with the exercise group; a possible explanation for this observation might be that the total prednisolone consumed was lower in the control group than in the exercise group at baseline (though not statistically significant). Nevertheless, the exercise group had a 10.4% improvement in predicted VO 2max compared to a 0.3% increment in the control group. One of the possible explanations for the difference might be that supervision and reinforcement given by physiotherapists during the training sessions (exercise group) facilitated the progression of the subjects in the exercise group. Similar results were shown in the study by Walther et al (2004) ; significant improvement was shown when training was provided, but there was no significant difference identified between the self-trained and supervised training groups. In addition, those patients with longer post-SARS duration walked less in the 6-minute walk test, probably due to more deconditioning during the 6 weeks after the initial baseline assessment.",

In addition, both groups had a higher predicted VO 2max value when compared to patients suffering from ARDS (24 ml/kg/min, Neff et al 2003) and COPD (12 ml/kg/min, Yoshikawa et al 2001) . This implies that the aerobic capacity of SARS patients was more responsive to exercise training than ARDS and COPD patients. Thus the effect of SARS on subjects' cardiovascular fitness and exercise tolerance performance is less than ARDS and COPD. The impaired physical fitness was due mainly to deconditioning and steroid-induced short-term myopathy and tachycardia (which was not as chronic as in COPD patients).",

Both the proximal and distal muscle strength improved as reflected by right handgrip strength and the curl-up and pushup tests. This is probably due to the training program. In general, patients with longer post-SARS duration showed weaker handgrip strength while male patients were stronger than females in isometric deltoid muscle strength. Hence the decrease in isometric muscle strength in the control group might be due to the effect of deconditioning and poor home exercise compliance after being discharged from the hospital. Thus the training program adopted in the current study is deemed necessary and effective in improving both the cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal performance in post-SARS patients. It might prevent further deconditioning after patients were discharged from hospital.",

However, the outcome of certain domains appeared to be associated with some factors. In general, older patients scored lower in role physical, general health, and mental health when compared to younger survivors. This could probably be explained by the ageing process (see Table  3 ). Male subjects also scored higher in role physical and role emotional when compared with female subjects as in other studies (Rothenhausler et al 2001 , Schelling et al 2000 , which was not due to the impact of SARS. In addition, patients (mostly health care workers) who had not yet resumed duty had a lower score in almost all physical and mental domains (except bodily pain) than those who had resumed duty before the end of the training program. It was likely that resumption of normal duty had helped restore the self-esteem and job satisfaction of the post-SARS patients. However, no difference was found between training and the control group in physical domains, probably meaning that return to work was not affected by post-SARS patients' physical ability.",
