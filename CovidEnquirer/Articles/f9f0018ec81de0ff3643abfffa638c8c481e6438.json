            "text": "To fully understand how pathogens infect their host and hijack key biological processes, systematic mapping of intra-pathogenic and pathogen-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial. Due to the relatively small size of viral genomes (usually around 10-100 proteins), generation of comprehensive host-virus PPI maps using different experimental platforms, including affinity tag purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approaches, can be achieved. Global maps such as these provide unbiased insight into the molecular mechanisms of viral entry, replication and assembly. However, to date, only two-hybrid methodology has been used in a systematic fashion to characterize viral-host protein-protein interactions, although a deluge of data exists in databases that manually curate from the literature individual host-pathogen PPIs. We will summarize this work and also describe an AP-MS platform that can be used to characterize viral-human protein complexes and discuss its application for the HIV genome.",

Yeast two-hybrid screenings consist of testing all pair wise combinations of proteins, which generates a collection of binary interactions. High-throughput Y2H maps have been generated for Saccharomyces cerevisiae [16, 23, 41, 47] , Caenorhabditis elegans [28, 45] , Drosophila [18] and humans [10, 35, 39] . Affinity tag purification-mass spectrometry approaches identify groups of proteins that participate in complexes and these have been used to study the cellular make-up of Escherichia coli [2, 5] , S. cerevisiae [17, 22, 27] and human cells [14] . While AP-MS assays have a higher propensity of detecting stable, stoichiometric complexes, Y2H screens tend to detect transient protein interactions [47] . Therefore the data from both approaches are complementary with respect to revealing physical connections between proteins, complexes and biological processes.",

For example, an intraviral Hepatitis C (HCV) Y2H interaction map was built using a limited set of predefined coding segments, which revealed the functional interactions between the proteins in the viral life cycle when a cell culture system is absent [15] . Also, using a Y2H approach, intraviral protein-protein interaction networks have been generated for two herpesviruses, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) [40] . The resulting PPI networks appear as a single highly connected module whereas cellular networks (e.g. yeast and human) have been observed to be organized in functional modules. Despite a broad range of pathogenicity, herpesviruses share a significant percentage of common conserved genes and the authors attempted to define a core set of interactions conserved among these viruses. Calderwood et al. proteomically interrogated another herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), by classifying the genes into two evolutionary classes based on conservation and showed enrichment for interactions among proteins in the same evolutionary class [6] . Another example of an intraviral PPI network based yeasttwo-hybrid matrix analysis was obtained for SARS coronavirus [43] . SARS-CoV has 14 ORFs, most of whose functions are unknown. Interestingly, one of the accessory proteins turned out to be highly connected, and the authors propose that although not essential for viral replication in cell culture systems, it could enhance the global stability of the SARS proteome network and pathogenicity.",

More recently, another study targeted Vaccinia virus, a large double stranded DNA virus with more than 280 ORFs and a prototype of the Orthopoxvirus, which includes several pathogenic poxviruses such as variola virus, a lethal human-specific pathogen that causes smallpox [49] . The authors reported a comprehensive yeast-two hybrid screening with 109 protein-protein interactions between vaccinia proteins and human proteins and provided functional insight into a number of uncharacterized viral proteins. Finally, Shapira et al. introduced a multilayered approach to uncover pathways in H1N1 infection by combining yeast-two-hybrid analysis and genome-wide expression profiling [38] . They found human factors mediating virus-host interactions, which were further studied via depletion analysis in primary lung cells. These types of unbiased physical and regulatory models of virus-host interactions provide a promising direction for the unveiling of new virus biology and development of new viral drugs [31] .",

Although 190 pathogens were analyzed in this study, 98.3% of the interactions were obtained from viruses and 77.9% of them were associated with HIV. Interactions of each of its 18 proteins have been individually studied in numerous labs, mostly using Y2H, but also AP/MS, in vitro binding and other methodologies. In an attempt to catalog these data, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Division of AIDS (NIAID) has initiated the development of an HIV-1 Human Protein Interaction database [33] . From HIV relevant publications, 2589 unique HIV-human PPIs among 1448 human proteins were curated (Fig. 1) ; 32% of these interactions are reported to be direct, physical interactions. Surprisingly, 37% of the human proteins on this list interact with more than one HIV-1 protein. For example, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), a signaling protein, has been described to interact with 10 HIV proteins.",

Therefore, although there have been a variety of excellent studies on HIV-1 human interactions, providing invaluable information about host factors crucial for HIV pathogenicity, a systematic approach of building the HIV-1-host protein-protein interaction network would help to get a clearer picture of the interconnection of the different virus components with the host cell.

Characterization of HIV-human protein-protein interactions during infection would arguably result in a dataset that would be most physiologically relevant. In order to accomplish this, however, one would have to tag the proteins in the context of the viral genome, infect the appropriate cells with these genetically altered viruses and then purify and identify the complexes. So far Integrase, Vif and Vpr have been successfully tagged within the provirus while maintaining infectivity [32, 36, 48] . Affinity purification of these proteins from infected cells led to the discovery of the Vif/ Cul5 complex and the finding that DDB1 is an additional component of the Vpr/DCAF1 complex. While this strategy is a very elegant way to identify virus-host interactions, it is not applicable to most of the HIV ORFs due to the overlapping organization of the HIV genome. Tagging these factors on either the N-or C-termini would disrupt the functions of the essential, overlapping proteins and would have detrimental effects on the function of the virus. Similarly, placing tags on the individual factors that comprise the polyproteins (Gag, Pol and Env) would result in similar expression problems for downstream proteins and/or adversely affect processing events by Protease, which would result in a disabled or comprised virus.",

MS identification of a host protein as a putative interactor allows for further investigation into the host-pathogen interaction, employing methods such as yeast two-hybrid, biochemical assays, or viral infectivity assays, to verify and establish the biological relevance of the viral-host interaction. In this regard, proper quantitative analysis of mass spectrometry data derived from affinity purified viral or host proteins is essential in identifying biologically meaningful PPIs in order to minimize time and resources expended on false-positive MS identified interactors. However, one major caveat of reported PPIs obtained from AP-MS experiments is often little information relating to protein abundance or specificity is directly revealed. Also, the interactor abundance may not even be the best indicator of the interaction reliability, especially since some protein abundance strongly depend on interaction affinity as well as its concentration in the cell or in the final experimental sample. If the purified material from a single affinity purification of one tagged protein bait is analyzed, even when contrasted with data from a non-tagged control, it remains incredibly difficult to ascertain specificity and reproducibility with respect to putative interactors. Furthermore, shotgun sequencing approaches to protein identification suffer from poor sampling of IP proteins independent of precision of sample purification replicates. For example, shotgun sequencing of the same sample may only result in 30-40% overlap with respect to proteins identified and may require 5-10 separate runs to obtain 95% coverage [12, 20, 26] .",

As an example concerning specificity, RNA binding proteins (e.g. Tat and Rev) will often be identified with ribosomal protein subunits due to binding to an RNA molecule and not a direct PPI occurring in situ. Likewise, any highly abundant cellular proteins (i.e. cytoskeleton proteins) tend to be identified in high abundance irrespective of the employed bait, indicating a problematic disconnect between protein abundance and interaction specificity.

            "text": "Each pull-down experiment can be represented as a vector of abundance scores (defined below) for all of the unique interactors found in our approach. When the specific interactor is not pulled down with particular bait, its abundance score is set to zero. The vectors of different affinity purification experiments can then be organized into a two-dimensional matrix, and the vectors of the replicated experiments extending further into the third dimension. In order to quantify abundance of identified proteins within a sample and to allow normalization of this data across different samples such that values between multiple datasets can be accurately compared, one can use the label-free SIN normalization method described previously [20] . The SIN formula takes into account the spectral intensities from each interactor, the total spectral intensities observed in the MS run, and the length of the protein identified, and has been shown to outperform other methods of quantifying abundance such as spectral counts or number of interactors identified [20] . Assuming constant binding capacities for the same baits in different experimental runs, we can define a new SIN score (pSIN) for a particular interactor from a single pull-down experiment as a proportion of the real SIN scores in that particular experiment. The pSIN is now normalized and therefore equivalent across all of the experiments, and is used to fill in the matrix cells. The first of the three proposed metrics, abundance, is then an average of interactor pSIN scores in the third (replicates) dimension in our data matrix. The second metric, reproducibility, which is derived from the values in the third dimension as well, should be a measure of how the interactor amounts (or pSIN scores) are reproducible among replicated experiments. The more reproducible numbers would be hence uniformly distributed, but less reproducible numbers would form peak(s), which suggests using the entropy as a measure of system organization. Before applying a standard entropy equation to the data, one has to normalize the scores in this third dimension so that they add up to one. To avoid biases due to different number of replicates, we also normalize the entropy, dividing it with the maximal entropy possible. The third metric, specificity, is defined similarly to abundance, except that instead of using the proportion of pSIN scores in the vector (or in first dimension), we use the proportions of abundances in the second dimension of the matrix. To avoid the inconvenience of dealing with interactions described by three scores, one can compress the three metrics into a single score using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical technique most commonly used to linearly transform the original set of data into the set of uncorrelated variables with the goal to reduce the dimensionality of this original data set.",

Using an approach like AP-MS, therefore, would be a powerful way to identify these relationships, especially when it is conducted in an unbiased and systematic way. Overlaying the PPI network with genetic information derived from global RNAi screens [4, 25, 46, 50] would help identify which of these phys-ical interactions have functional consequences.

Since large-scale T cell transfections are difficult, stably transfected cell lines should be generated. A regulatable expression system should be used since expression of several HIV proteins affect cell viability. Jurkat TRex cells (Invitrogen), for example, stably express the tetracylin repressor protein so that genes from Tet operon containing plasmids like pcDNA4/TO are only expressed upon tetracyclin induction. Jurkat TRex cells are maintained in RPMI, 10% FCS, 10 lg/ml blasticidin, 1% PenStrep. For generation of stable clones, 1 \u00c2 10 6 cells are transfected with 2 ug linearized pcDNA4/TO plasmid by electroporation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa). Stably transfected cells are selected in 300 lg/ml Zeocin for several weeks and single clones are isolated by limited dilution. Expression of HIV proteins is induced by 1 lg/ml Doxycylin for 12-24 h. Expression levels of proteins with a short half-life (e.g. Vif) can be increased by addition of 500 nM protease inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem) during induction.",
