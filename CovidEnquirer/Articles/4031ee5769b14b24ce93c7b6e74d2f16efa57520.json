We have been able to describe the deposition of aerosols in the capillary pores for depth filtration, the deposition of aerosols in the cake (surface filtration), and the intermediate bridging regime between these two. We can depict the complete pressure drop excursion including the S-shaped curve behavior from depth filtration transiting to surface filtration for a filter with severe skin effect. Our prediction matches extremely well with the 6 cycles of loading/ cleaning on a 280-nm nanofiber filter subject to challenging nano-aerosols, 50-400 nm. During cyclic loading and cleaning, the porosity and permeability in the skin layer for our experiment drop to 68% and 11-21% of their original values, respectively, and the effective pore diameter also drops from 1.2 to 0.6 lm.",

On the other hand, nanofibers [1, 2] with fiber diameter 100-300 nm, that are 1/10 of the diameter of microfiber, can effectively capture these nano-aerosols. The operating characteristic of using nanofibers has been investigated for nanofiber filter with low aerosol loading, such as face mask [3, 4] , and with high aerosol loading, such as filters for offices, indoors, and cabins of airplanes, trains and vehicles [5, 6] . With high aerosol loading, aerosols that got trapped by filter can reduce the flowable pores of the filter. Further, the region near the upstream end of the filter which faces the challenging aerosol stream tends to trap more aerosols not only just from the fibers of the filter, but also from the trapped aerosols themselves producing an avalanche/domino effect. This region is known as a ''skin\" layer [6, 7] with majority of the aerosol trapped tightly there and also it accounts for a large percentage of the pressure drop across the filter. This is also analogous to the skin effect in liquid filtration [8] . When the filter pressure drop reaches an unacceptable level, backpulse and backblow can be used to clean the filter [9, 10] . First, when a cake has already formed on the filter, the cake needs to be blown off first from the filter surface prior to blowing aerosols trapped inside the filter. Aerosols in the filter that are loosened by backpulse and being blowback to the upstream end of the filter may get recaptured in the skin region again reducing the flowable pores further. This certainly modifies the filter porous structure especially at the skin region even during cleaning. Some interesting questions remain to be addressed:",

Given the target collector (ground) was placed 15-19 cm from the feed rotor and the voltage of the feed electrode was typically at 60 kV, this set up a highly charged electrostatic field from the rotor to the collecting plate. The strings were dipped into the solution by the rotation of the rotor drawing solution out of the trough onto the wire surface. When the wires rotated out of the solution, excess solution from the wires dripped back to the trough. As the solution thinned out to a film wrapping around the wire, the large electric field force can overcome the surface tension of the film at which Taylor cones formed along the surface of the wires. These cones evolved eventually into micro-jets leaving the wire making free flight towards the ground electrode under the intense electric field. In the due course, both evaporation of the solvent and repulsion of charges thinned out the fibers to a much smaller diameter by the time when they eventually got collected at the substrate attached to the ground electrode. The nanofibers formed are nonwoven with mat thickness that can be controlled by electrospinning time. The longer is the spinning time, the thicker is the mat.

The cleaning was triggered at the arbitrary set upper limit pressure drop of 850 Pa. Backpulse followed by backblow were carried out with a tri-nozzle setup with clean airflow in reverse direction, from the downstream side of loading. The applied pressure of 6.5 bar was used in all cleaning process. The duration of pulse-jet, idle, and backblow were 0.5 s, 0.2 s and 10 s, respectively. These have been reported elsewhere in details [9] . Throughout the experiment, pressure drop across the filter and the flow rate were monitored by a digital pressure manometer and a flowmeter, respectively.

Over time, a dense skin layer of aerosol deposit forms at the upstream end of the filter, while there is much less aerosol deposition in the downstream end of the filter. The pressure drop across the skin region also accounts for a large percentage of the entire pressure drop across the filter. Further with more aerosol loading, bridges of aerosols form across the open pore of the nanofiber filter at the upstream face leading to formation of a cake layer on the filter surface (surface or cake filtration).

The deposition of aerosols during the second loading can be described in Fig. 4a by which the flowable pore of the nanofiber is depicted as a capillary with initial radius R o (before second aerosol loading). The amount of aerosols can be idealized as deposition by the same aerosol volume uniformly redistributed in the interior wall along the capillary reducing the inner wall radius from initially R o to R(t), wherein R(t) ( R o , see Fig. 4b . When the capillary open area reduces to about 50-60% of its initial open area, it is assumed that the open area is so restrictive that further incoming aerosol will deposit as an ''aerosol bridge across\" the open pore. The deposition of aerosols on existing bridges continues until the bridging process is completed with initial cake layer forming on top of these bridges and thus on the filter surface, see Fig. 4c . This condition can be modelled as though there is sufficient aerosol deposit filling the capillary to its center axis, see Fig. 4d . The cake continues to grow on the filter surface until the combined pressure drop across the filter and cake reaches the preset maximum pressure drop limit by which loading stops and cleaning is initiated. The subsequent loadings, 3rd, 4th, . . . , nth, etc. follow similar fashion as with the second loading. The major processes are 1. Narrowing of the equivalent capillary pore with initial radius R o in the skin layer. 2. Bridging across the opening of the capillary pore. Aerosol bridges form on existing bridges until they interfere with each other merging to a continuous cake layer. 3. Cake continues to build-up with more aerosol deposition until the preset pressure drop limit across the filter media and the cake is reached. 4. Blowing the cake off the filter, partial removal of aerosol in the capillary leading to re-widening of the constricted capillary pore back to a ''new\" R o .",

In both cases, first the capillary is modelled as flowable capillaries across the entire filter thickness, which contrast with our model in which the capillaries are located only across the skin layer, that is only a small fraction upstream of the filter, which plays a dominant role in the filling and leading to the transition of cake formation on the filter. Second, in our model the deposition is assumed to be uniform across the capillaries of the skin layer; Submicron aerosol generator (SMAG) and filter tester for respectively, grade efficiency with monodispersed particle size distribution and aerosol loading on filter with polydispersed particle size distribution. whereas in the other two earlier work [13, 14] the deposition is distributed non-uniformly across the capillaries. Third, after the capillaries are filled to a certain point, aerosol bridging across the capillary pore openings is initiated. Subsequent aerosol bridging occurs on the filter surface until the aerosol bridges from neighboring capillaries interfere with each other and merge to form a continuous cake layer above the filter surface. This ''aerosol bridging\" process, the intermediate step which can take time, is absent in earlier work [13, 14] ; and in fact, they assume the transition from capillary filling to cake formation is instantaneous. With our capillary model as described, which is distinctly used differently from earlier studies, we can write out the pertinent equations in the following.",

Pressure excursion over loading followed by cleaning Fig. 6a shows the experimental pressure excursion of a clean filter followed by loading to a maximum allowable pressure (somewhat arbitrary) followed by cleaning by backpulse and backblow as described earlier. This cyclic loading/cleaning was repeated 5 more times. The duration of the first loading cycle was quite long 5.6 h to reach the maximum set pressure limit of 850 Pa followed by backpulse and backblow which took 0.6 h and the pressure drop was restored back to 100 Pa. On the other hand, the 2nd loading cycle only took 3.2 h to be followed by a constant cleaning of 0.6 h. The 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th loading took even less time but quite consistently constant, respectively, at 2.3, 2.8, 2.1 and 1.85 h, and each loading was followed by a 0.6-h cleaning. These are all summarized in Table 1 . Fig. 6b shows only the experimental loading behavior in closer details. The behavior of the 1st loading cycle is concave upward (depth filtration with aerosols filling both the skin region and the filter interior) followed by a linear trend (cake filtration). On the other hand, the behavior of 2nd and subsequent cycles are all predominantly concave downward (later attributed to only skin loading) followed by again a linear trend (cake filtration). Note at the start of loading the pressure drop recorded is denoted as Dp o (see Fig. 5b ) and this value increases with increasing cycle, see Fig. 6a . For example, Dp o is 22 Pa for a clean filter, after the first loading and cleaning, it jumps up to 104 Pa at the beginning of the 2nd loading cycle, 147 Pa for the 3rd, 147 for the 4th, 172 Pa for the 5th and finally 197 Pa for the 6th. Dp o makes a large jump from 1st to 2nd due to formation of a skin layer and thereafter the skin layer keeps tightening over repeated loading and Dp o keeps creeping upward but at a much slower pace. For reference, Dp o is also compiled in Table 1 . As will be seen, Dp o is an important measurement ''quantifying\" the skin characteristics (inversely related to the skin permeability, or inversely related to the square of capillary radius).",

After the pressure builds up to a maximum level, the filter is backpulsed followed by backblow to remove as much trapped aerosols. There are definitely residual aerosols left in both the skin and the filter interior that cannot be removed despite cleaning. In the 2nd and subsequent cycles of loading up to 6th cycles, the pressure excursion over mass deposition at least in the beginning is very steep confirming further aerosol deposition in the skin layer of the filter leading to more flow restriction.

Based on these values, we can infer that the permeability of the skin layer has dropped to 21% of its original values when the filter was cleaned before aerosol loading. This permeability decreases gradually for subsequent 2nd-6th cycles under quasi-equilibrium. It is interesting that after the 2nd cycle, there is virtually no deposition of aerosols inside the filter.
