In recent years, respiratory disease has plagued most swine operations, including those that have instituted capitalintensive disease reduction strategies such as age-segregated rearing, multiple-site production, and early weaning. A disease pattern has emerged that has been designated the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). PRDC is characterized by slow growth, decreased feed efficiency, anorexia, fever, cough, and dyspnea in finishing pigs. 28 PRDC is multifactorial because multiple pathogens are typically detected. PRDC has been observed in differing management and facility schemes, including intensive production systems. All these factors combine to produce the respiratory disease commonly observed in grow-finish pigs. Typically, PRDC occurs at 14 to 20 weeks of age and has been referred to as the \"18-week wall.\"",

            "text": "In recent years, a number of emerging and changing pathogens have played an important role in the development of PRDC. The emergence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in the latter part of the 1980s has resulted in significant changes in the health status of the worldwide swine population. PRRSV is considered the most serious pathogen in the swine industry. In addition to PRRSV, several other respiratory pathogens have emerged, including porcine circovirus type 2, porcine respiratory coronavirus, which is a mutant strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and new strains of swine influenza virus (H3N2). In addition to the newly emerged pathogens, several well-known organisms remain difficult to control. These organ- From Because PRDC is not caused by a single entity but rather is a multifactorial disease, the pathogens isolated from pigs vary between and within production units. The most common pathogens detected in pigs with clinical disease consistent with PRDC are as follows: . Disease induced by porcine circovirus type 2 appears to be increasing in frequency based on detection in pigs with PRDC. Many of the other respiratory pathogens, such as S. suis, P. multocida, H. parasuis, and A. pleuropneumonia are important factors in respiratory disease; however, frequency of isolation has remained unchanged or decreased. As the number of pathogens in an animal increases, the interaction between individual organisms becomes more complex and the intricate patterns and roles of each become increasingly difficult to elucidate. Although the pathogenesis is known for most of these common respiratory pathogens, less is known about the host responses to these agents. Only in the past few years have the reagents and technologies been available to measure the various responses of the swine immune system. Accordingly, many questions remain concerning the immunology of PRDC.",

Molitor et al 44 found that within 1 week of PRRSV infection, there was a dramatic decrease in the number of pulmonary alveolar macrophages, and the remaining macrophages were functionally compromised. A study by Duan et aPl demonstrated that no more than 2% of pulmonary alveolar macrophages stained positively for PRRSV antigen at the acute stage of infection, further suggesting that the depletion of pulmonary alveolar macrophages does not occur, In addition to lysis of cells, studies have demonstrated apoptosis of macrophages in PRRSVinfected lung tissues,56 PRRSV induces apoptosis in bystander cells, thus damaging more macrophages than just those infected with PRRSV. In addition to destruction of macrophages, PRRSV has been demonstrated to affect their ability to kill organisms. This concept was confirmed with studies that investigated the interaction between 5, suis and PRRSV, in which pigs infected with both organisms show an increased septicemia and mortality.25,63 In a study,64 PRRSV infection adversely affected the ability of pulmonary intravascular macrophages (which are important for clearance of blood pathogens in pigs) to eliminate the S. suis organisms from the blood, resulting in increased mortality of pigs. In contrast, experimental coinfection of PRRSV with other pathogens, including Haemophilus parasuis, swine influenza virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, has failed to identify an increase in clinical disease associated with coinfections. 57 , 59, 73 Interestingly, in contrast to PRRSV exacerbating M. hyopneumoniae-induced pneumonia, it was found that M. hyopneumoniae increased the severity and duration of PRRSV-induced pneumonia in pigs infected with both pathogens, independent of the timing of infection with either pathogen. 59 Thus, identification of the mechanisms that enable PRRSV infection to increase the incidence of secondary infections observed in the field has been frustrating to demonstrate experimentally.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in PRRSV-infected pigs had an increase in both IFN-')' levels, signifying a TH1 type of response, and IL-10 levels, a cytokine associated with a TH2 response. 65 These results allow the speculation that the presence of PRRSV in the respiratory tract results in the alteration of the immune response toward a less effective TH2 type of response. Further support of this finding is provided by the results of a study that found decreased efficacy of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination, even though the levels of M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibodies systemically and in the respiratory tract were increased. 60 Although the immune response required to eliminate PRRSV from the pig has not been identified, it can be speculated that a THI response with the corresponding increase in macrophage activation and cytotoxic T lymphocytes would be the most effective immune response for controlling and eliminating the virus. Directing the immune system toward the T H2 response would enable the virus to persist. Another role for IL-IO is to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis, which may increase the number of susceptible macrophages. 46 The alteration of the environment in the respiratory tract may have a significant impact on the pig's ability to control other respiratory pathogens during active PRRSV infection. Although information on the impact of the virus on the respiratory immune system is still under investigation, the role of PRRSV in PRDC is becoming better characterized.",

Adherence of M. hyopneumoniae to the cilia results in clumping and loss of cilia, with a consequent reduced function of the mucociliary apparatus. 19 The loss of mucociliary function is thought to be a significant contributor to the increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections associated with M. hyopneumoniae infection. Enzootic pneumonia occurs when M. hyopneumoniae infection is combined with opportunistic bacteria such as P. multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, S. suis, H. parasuis, or Arcanobacterium pyogenes.

Although identified separately, cross-reactivity between serovars is common. Although the incidence of pneumonia induced by APP appears stable, increased frequency of disease initially occurred with the development of intensive swine management practices. The economic impact of the disease is primarily caused by the mortality and medical costs associated with acute outbreaks. In chronically infected herds, production parameters are diminished somewhat, typically by delayed time to slaughter. APP infects and colonizes cells of the respiratory tract and has been isolated from lungs, blood (septicemia), and nasal discharge. The organism adheres to the alveolar epithelium through fimbria. Survivors of acute infections often become chronic carriers, with the organisms persisting in necrotic lung tissues, tonsils, and occasionally the nasal cavity. APP produces the toxins ApxI, ApxII, and ApxIII, all of which are toxic to pulmonary alveolar macrophages, endothelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of the small blood vessels in the lung parenchyma. APP has a capsule that protects the organism from destruction by macrophages and also allows resistance against lysis by complement. 53 Production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-8, and TNF has been shown to accompany infection and pneumonia. 8 ,33 The damage to the lungs associated with APP infection is due to both the production of APX toxins, the lipopolysaccharide, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. 23 ,34 This is in contrast to M. hyopneumoniae infection, where much of the pneumonia is immune mediated. Damage caused by production of the proinflammatory cytokines and toxins is evident in the severe hemolytic necrosis and thrombosis observed in pigs with pneumonia from APP infection.",

Currently at least 15 serovars have been recognized, based on a heat-stable polysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide, and differences in the disease induced by the various serovars are apparent. Different isolates of the same serovar can also vary significantly in the disease induced. H. parasuis colonizes the lower and upper respiratory tract. 69 Colonization results in loss of cilia and damage to ciliated epithelial cells; however, the bacteria are not closely associated with either the cilia or the epithelial cells. 68 Damage to the mucosal epithelial cells may facilitate invasion. Organism and host factors associated with virulence are unknown, but some strains of H. parasuis are more virulent than others, with as few as 100 colonyforming units inducing systemic disease and death. 51 Disease symptoms such as thrombosis and petechiae in the liver, kidneys, and meninges are consistent with septicemia. Fibrinosuppurative polyserositis, polyarthritis, and meningitis occur as the organism colonizes and replicates on the various serosal surfaces. 69 Pneumonia, when present, cannot be readily differentiated from pneumonia induced by other bacteria. Isolation of the organism from the lungs is frequently not correlated to pneumonia. 68 H. parasuis often appears to be an opportunistic pathogen, causing disease in association with other bacterial and viral infections. 26 ,48 Studies have found that PRRSV does not increase the severity of disease induced by H. parasuis. 57 Little information is known about the pathogenesis of H. parasuis, and even less is known about its effect on the host immune response or the immune response required to clear the organism. It is probable that H. parasuis significantly diminishes the effectiveness of the mucociliary apparatus that would predispose the respiratory tract to other opportunistic bacteria. In addition, induction of proinflammatory cytokines in conjunction with septicemia and polyserositis can be assumed.

Production of these proinflammatory cytokines increases the inflammation in the lung, which further diminishes the respiratory immune system's ability to control pathogens. Although an inflammatory response is important in the control of pathogens within the respiratory tract, the tissue injury and disease subsequent to M. hyopneumoniae infection appears to be caused more by the host response rather than by the microbe itself. Inflammation appears to be an important factor in the potentiation of PRRSV-induced pneumonia by M. hyopneumoniae because recent research in the author's laboratory showed increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pigs infected with PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae throughout the course of disease. 59 ,65 Similar to PRRSV, all of the mechanisms used by M. hyopneumoniae to modulate the respiratory immune system are still unidentified. The presence of M. hyopneumoniae alone is enough to induce inflammation and increase the disease associated with other respiratory pathogens. 6 , 7, 59 The role that M. hyopneumoniae, which is minimally pathogenic by itself, plays in exacerbating the pneumonia induced by other respiratory pathogens is a significant factor in PRDC.",
