In addition, the relationship between the clinical characteristics of patients and significant intervention scores was analyzed. We enrolled patients younger than 12 months who were diagnosed with ALTE from January 2005 to December 2012. There were 29 ALTE infants with a peak incidence of age younger than 1 month (48.3%). The most common symptoms for ALTE diagnosis were apnea (69.0%) and color change (58.6%). Eleven patients appeared normal upon arrival at hospital but 2 patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the initial ALTE. The most common ALTE cause was respiratory disease, including respiratory infection and upper airway anomalies (44.8%). There were 20 cases of repeat ALTE and 2 cases of death during hospitalization. Four patients (15.4%) experienced recurrence of ALTE after discharge and 4 patients (15.4%) showed developmental abnormalities during the follow-up period. The patients with ALTE during sleep had lower significant intervention scores (P = 0.015) compared to patients with ALTE during wakefulness and patients with previous respiratory symptoms had higher significant intervention scores (P = 0.013) than those without previous respiratory symptoms.",

These episodes were referred to as \"near-misses\" for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (1), and considered a possible cause of SIDS. In 1986, the National Institutes of Health consensus conference named these episodes apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) and defined them using the following criteria: some combination of central or obstructive apnea; color change; marked change in muscle tone; and choking or gagging (2) . It is a frightening event, occurring predominantly in infancy and accounting for 0.6%-1.7% of all emergency department (ED) visits for infants younger than 1 yr of age and 0.5%-6% of all infant visits (3) (4) (5) (6) . It is associated with a 0%-6% mortality rate (2) .",

This het- erogeneity causes difficulties for clinicians deciding how to manage patients with ALTE. The admission rate for ALTE is usually 75%-100% (9-12), reflecting the recommendations of many centers that all patients with ALTE be admitted for a period of inpatient observation. Some studies suggested that the major indicators of admission and further evaluation were prematurity, age younger than 30 days or older than 60 days, history of other illness, recurrent ALTE, and abnormal result in the initial examination (4, 9, 10) . In our study, the admission rate of ALTE infant was 100% and duration of hospital stay was 2-38 days.",

There was no evidence to recommend routine nonspecific tests such as CBC, serum glucose, or electrolyte levels (20) . On the other hand, Vandenplas et al. (21) suggested that, although GER was considered a major cause of ALTE, routine GER testing is unnecessary in children with ALTE. The incidence of GER is generally high in infancy regardless, and a positive result is not a confirmation of a relationship between GER and ALTE. In our study, 8 patients underwent an upper gastrointestinal study because 4 had been previously diagnosed with GER, 2 had feeding-related ALTE, 1 had a history of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, and 1 had recurrent pneumonia. Seven patients showed positive signs of GER (grade I in 2, grade II in 3, grade III in 2), but GER was only confirmed as a cause of ALTE at discharge in 3 patients. In this regard, our results were similar to the previous study.",

Risk factors, such as prematurity, which had been described as poor prognosis factors in previous studies, did not show statistical significance in relation to the significant intervention scores.

This study showed the importance of close follow-up after discharge. The authors also found that 5% of patients developed adverse neurological outcomes, including chronic epilepsy and developmental delays. Nunes et al. (25) reported that among 56 patients with ALTE, 51.5% show ed normal outcome, 4 showed repeated ALTE, and none report ed deaths due to SIDS. The authors concluded that the outcome is generally related to the associated underlying disease. We found no cases of mortality after discharge, but there were 4 cases (15.4%) of recurrent ALTE after discharge occurring nearly within 2 weeks. During the median 6-month followup period, 4 patients (15.4%) showed developmental abnormalities, although we could not definitively identify the relationship between developmental delay and ALTE relapse. Our study had several limitations. The present study was a small sized retrospective study, and patients' data were collected only from a retrospective chart review. Accordingly, we could have missed some portion of ALTE patients. The number of deaths was too small to analyze any potentially significant difference of clinical course according to death.",
