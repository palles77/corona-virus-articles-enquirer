Stem cells are endowed with seeming unlimited ability to form any cell type. This ability could potentially allow application of stem cells to treatment of a wide variety of medical conditions. Successful management of previously untreatable disease seems feasible. The challenges of translating the promise of stem cells from successful basic scientific research into clinical use are great, but the FDA is prepared to work with the scientific community to bring safe and effective stem-cell therapies into the medical armamentarium. The molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell self-renewal and commitment to a variety of cell fates pose vexing problems in developmental biology. Nonetheless, FDA regulatory oversight of stem cell-based therapy must address these complexities. Although many of the scientific questions of gene regulation, cell-cell interaction, and mechanisms controlling differentiation are unsolved, the regulatory approach used in the Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies and developed in many parts of the FDA is designed to allow progress in clinical research while ensuring, to the best of our ability, patient safety and protection of patient rights.",

Accordingly, the Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies (OCTGT) employs scientists and clinicians involved in full-time review and some who, in addition to their review responsibilities, also pursue laboratory research programs in areas such as developmental biology. This approach ensures that all aspects of product, preclinical, and clinical development are overseen by staff possessing state-of-the art expertise and scientific judgment. Moreover, substantial experience with the regulation of other emergent technologies such as use of recombinant proteins, gene transfer, and cellular therapies has resulted in a regulatory and policy framework that can meet the challenge confronting medical use of stem cells. Finally, oversight of this novel therapeutic approach benefits from input provided by external expert panels such as the FDA's Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee (BRMAC). For example, the BRMAC convened to consider challenges posed by stem cell-based therapies and has assisted tremendously in development of a regulatory framework for oversight of this field. 1 Stem cell-based therapies will likely include a variety of approaches including administration of undifferentiated stem cells or transplantation of differentiated cells derived from stem cells. Consequently, there is a need for increased understanding of the mechanisms regulating stem cell growth, cell fate determination, and differentiation. An important goal of this understanding is to eliminate the risk of inappropriate cell differentiation or transformation while ensuring that longterm benefits include prolonged function and viability of the therapeutic stem cells or their cellular descendents, in the absence of adverse events.",

The experience of stem cell manufacturers is communicated in meetings with the FDA staff, at presentations at scientific meetings, and at presentations to the FDA's BRMAC. BRMAC meetings allow the FDA to obtain advice in a public forum on scientific issues that affect stem cell experiments. This format allows all interested parties to participate. Transcripts of these meetings are available on the CBER Web site (http://www.fda.gov/cber/). The BRMAC's advice on issues such as characterization of neuronal stem cell therapy products has been valuable as the CBER staffs develop stem cell policy. 1 Another important resource that facilitates development of recommendations for regulation of stem cells involves the FDA-National Institutes of Health (NIH) interagency interactions through formalized Memoranda of Understanding Agreements (MOUs) that allow bidirectional input on translational research. The FDA benefits from the scientific expertise of NIH program managers and intramural scientists, and the NIH benefits from the FDA scientific perspectives on important funding initiatives to expedite translation of research from bench to bedside. For example, under the MOU, the NIH can involve FDA expertise in Request for Application (RFA) design for translational research. In addition to these MOUs, there is increasing participation by the FDA in expert advisory panels that develop recommendations for NIH translational research programs. These feedback mechanisms serve the FDA-regulated community, the NIH-funded research community, and the public by focusing scientific and funding resources on developing novel technologies such as stem cell use to address challenges to public health.",

Finally, autologous or allogeneic cord blood, peripheral blood, or bone marrow stem cell products will be regulated under IND if more than minimal manipulation occurs, the cell product is combined with a drug or device, or the intended use is considered to be nonhomologous. Although the field of stem cell biology has produced evidence that stem cell activity for a variety of lineages can be demonstrated in cord blood, peripheral blood, or bone marrow cell preparations, the FDA will regard use of these products for anything beyond hematopoietic reconstitution as nonhomologous use until a clearer scientific picture emerges.",

Drastically reduced viability of individual lots can be an important warning regarding manufacturing conditions or presence of toxic impurities. Great variability in viability can potentially indicate problems with the manufacturing process. For somatic cellular therapies, the minimum acceptable viability specification of the final product is generally set at 70%. If this level cannot be achieved, data should be generated to justify the lower viability specification by demonstrating that dead cells and cell debris do not affect the safe administration or therapeutic effect of the stem cell product.",

The number of viable cells administered to a patient or in preclinical studies is important in following the safety and efficacy of stem cell products. Determination of a suitable dose in terms of both safety and efficacy is a challenge due to the ability of stem cells to selfrenew and to differentiate. However, every attempt should be made to design appropriate preclinical studies to address this challenge. Such studies, as well as any applicable clinical experience, should be used in setting the specifications for cell number in stem cell product doses.",

A suitable potency assay should measure relative biologic function of the product and should be useful in establishing a safe and efficacious dose for administration to patients. However, determination of the specific biologic functions of a stem cell that predict its useful and safe cell fate is a challenging necessity. Depending on the specific stem cell product, a variety of possible approaches can be envisioned. The FDA does not have specific requirements for particular potency assessments and will consider the merits of individual proposals in the context of overall risk-benefit considerations depending on the disease indication and the patient population. Potency can be established using several assays, which should include a quantitative assay but may also include qualitative biologic assays. In terms of product development, potency assays should be in place by the end of IND phase 2 and should consists of in vivo or in vitro tests that measure an appropriate biologic activity. This assay should be validated by licensure.",
