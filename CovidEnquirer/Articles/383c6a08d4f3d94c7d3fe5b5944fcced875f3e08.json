            "text": "Rapid aviation commercialisation and upsurge in worldwide affluence created a new avenue for disease proliferation across countries at an unprecedented rate. Epidemic and pandemic occurrences over the last decade demonstrate airports' role in disease transmission; while also exhibiting their importance as containment nodes. Tremendous amount of resources and effort are necessary to achieve the latter but inevitably, disrupt normal operations. The contrasting objectives between public health authorities and airport authorities result in compromising measures for both parties. Broadly similar controlling measures were adopted by various airports during outbreaks in the last decade. Their effectiveness have been analysed in terms of disease control; economic impact to airports were, however, not quantified. This paper concludes that more efficient airport pandemic control plans cause less severe economic impact on airports during pandemic and recommends a streamlined approach that improves overall effect of pandemic control while minimising economic impacts to airport businesses.",

            "text": "SARS took the world by surprise in 2003. The speed of transmission was so rampant that World Health Organization (WHO) issued travel advisories to Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and several other countries. As such, Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Singapore Changi Airport (SCA) suffered devastating repercussions as flights were cancelled and passenger flow plummeted. Air travel was pin-pointed as the main reason behind the escalation of local outbreaks to global epidemics as infections propagated at an exponential rate through aviation travel. While cross infections were not limited to within aircraft cabins or vicinity of airports, they were undoubtedly the ideal venues for screening control of infected air passengers. The psychological and economic impacts of ineffective screening at airports were substantial which directly affected airport business in 2003. Contrary to their recommendations in 2003, travel recommendations were not issued by WHO for either the Avian Influenza threat in 2006 or the Swine Flu pandemic in 2009. The then WHO Director-General Margret Chan explained the decision against travel recommendations against Mexico in 2009: \"\u2026 they do not protect the public. They do not contain the outbreak. And they do not prevent further international spread\" (WHO, 2009 ). Interestingly, she compared the influenza pandemic to \"tidal wave\" that could not be realistically contained through restricting travel. Over that period, aviation business was adversely affected albeit to a much smaller extent than 2003, the details of which would be further discussed in this study.",

The more efficient the airport pandemic control plan, the less severe the economic impact on the airport during a pandemic. It was undeniable that the aviation industry was not prepared in 2003. Ever since then, lessons learnt have been shared among airports and thermal-scanning cameras gradually became the industrial standard for containment screening. While 2006 saw a pretty low transmissible avian influenza H5N1 that did not sufficiently test the overall system, it was not as fortunate in 2009 where the swine flu H1N1 exposed the short-comings. Although thermal screening was useful (Cowling et al., 2010a) , there were weaknesses in the overall process which allowed asymptomatic carriers to slip through detections in Singapore (Mukherjee et al., 2010) , Japan (Nishiura and Kamiya, 2011) and New Zealand (Priest et al., 2010) during the 2009 pandemic.",

The method, which was proposed by Gaber (2011) , would obviously be more effective; nonetheless, this is also more restrictive and complicated for airlines, airports and passengers alike. Airlines are inclined to make the unpopular decision to disallow all febrile passengers from boarding if pre-departure screenings are to be conducted.

This could be a contributory factor to the low impact on worldwide passenger traffic volume in 2006. Additionally, the lessons from 2003 SARS epidemic were still fresh in the minds of aviation operators. Control measures were recommended to be implemented by the ACI (2006) early in the year.
