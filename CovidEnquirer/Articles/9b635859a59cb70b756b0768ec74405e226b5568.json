The observation that these lipoprotein particles are heavily disulphide crosslinked is paradoxical since HBsAg assembly is classically believed to occur in the ER, and hence in the presence of high levels of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) which should resolve these higher intermolecular crosslinks. Indeed, incubation of mature, highly disulphide crosslinked HBsAg with recombinant PDI causes the disassembly of HBsAg to dimers. We have used antibodies against resident ER proteins in double immunofluorescence studies to study the stages of the conversion of the HBsAg from individual protein subunits to the secreted, crosslinked, oligomer. We show that HBsAg is rapidly sorted to a post-ER, pre-Golgi compartment which excludes PDI and other major soluble resident ER proteins although it overlaps with the distribution of rab2, an established marker of an intermediate compartment. Kinetic studies showed that disulphide-linked HBsAg dimers began to form during a short (2 rain) pulse, increased in concentration to peak at 60 rain, and then decreased as the dimers were crosslinked to form higher oligomers. These higher oligomers are the latest identifiable intracellular form of HBsAg before its secretion (h/2 = 2 h). Brefeldin A treatment does not alter the localization of HBsAg in this PDI excluding compartment, however, it blocks the formation of new oligomers causing the accumulation of dimeric HBsAg. Hence this oligomerization must occur in a pre-Golgi compartment. These data support a model in which rapid dimer formation, catalyzed by PDI, occurs in the ER, and is followed by transport of dimers to a pre-Golgi compartment where the absence of PDI and a different lumenal environment allow the assembly process to be completed.",

            "text": "Previous studies have provided much information on the biogenesis and the secretion of HBsAg. Eble et al. (1986) demonstrated that in a cell-free translation system HBsAg is initially synthesized as a transmembrane polypeptide that spans the lipid bilayer at least twice. Cultured cells which are transfected with the coding region for HBsAg secrete 22-nm particles that are morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from those in serum (Crowley et al., 1983; Dubois et al., 1980; Liu et al., 1982; Moriarty et al., 1982; Patzer et al., 1984 Patzer et al., , 1986 Simon et al., 1988) . Using such a system, Simon et al. (1988) showed that HBsAg becomes carbonate extractable with a very similar half-time to that of particle secretion. This indicated that the rate-limiting step in the export process is the budding of the lipoprotein particles from the membrane. All of the oligosaccharides on the secreted HBsAg lipoprotein particles are of the N-linked complex type. However Patzer et al. (1984) showed that all of the glycans on cellular HBsAg were of the high mannose type. Hence, the rate limiting step in secretion must lie prior to the medial Golgi. EM of HBsAg in infected or in stably transfected cells reveals particles within the lumen of smooth intracellular membranes (Gerber et al., 1974; Shibayama et al., 1984; Patzer et al., 1986) . These regions have been interpreted as elements of the ER and contributed to a consensus view that particle assembly in the membrane and budding which is the rate limiting step in lipoprotein secretion, occurs in the ER (reviewed in Ganem and Varmus, 1987) .",

The current model for intracellular disulphide bond formation is based on studies of intramolecular disulphide pairing in soluble monomeric proteins (Freedman and Hillson, 1980; Creighton, 1984; Freedman, 1984) . The rate limiting step in the folding of many disulphide containing proteins is the exchange of disulphide bonds to generate the final, lowest free energy arrangement of the native state. Protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), an abundant, soluble resident protein of the ER, accelerates this process by catalyzing disulphide bond exchange and so causes dissociation of disulphide-linked aggregates and allows refolding of proteins to their native, properly disulphide-linked conformation. Two classes of disulphide bonds can be distinguished operationally in our studies. The first class comprises the crosslinks within an HBsAg dimer. We hypothesized that the formation of these bonds would be promoted by PDI since they are analogous to the bonds linking small oligomers such as influenza haemagglutinin. We shall refer to this class as dimer crosslinks. The second set of crosslinks are those that bind dimers together to form the highly crosslinked oligomer. We felt that it was unlikely that this second class would be stable in the presence of PDI since they resemble the aggregated crosslinks resolved by this enzyme. The formation of these oligomer crosslinks cannot be completed without particle assembly since they stabilize the oligomeric lipoprotein particle.",

We show here that I-IBsAg is transported to a compartment which is intermediate between the ER and the Golgi and which excludes the major resident soluble ER proteins such as PDI but overlaps with rab2, a marker of an intermediate compartment. We also show that the formation of the dimer crosslinks is completed in the ER while the formation of oligomer crosslinks occurs after exit from the ER and coincides with the budding of particles into the lumen of this intermediate compartment. We also demonstrate directly that the two classes of disulphide crosslinks have different energies since incubation of isolated, highly crosslinked particles with PDI causes the conversion of oligomers to dimers.",

The image data was processed with a series of networks in the Application Visualization System (AVS, Stardent Computer) on a Stardent 2000 GS. The separate image datasets were aligned by cross correlation and combined. The confocal microscope data could be used without further alignment. The further analysis followed the general procedure introduced by Dr. Jean Davoust (Marseilles) for the treatment of double-labeled confocal images and implemented by us as a series of AVS modules. The reader is directed to his paper (manuscript submitted for publication) for a complete description of the procedure. Briefly, the two vector valued array of pixel data is repiotted as the number of occurrences of pixels with a given ratio of red to green. This second plot reveals the correlation between red and green values for a given pixei and hence the likelihood that the antigen labeled with the fluorescein coupled antibody is found in the same position as the antigen labeled with the rhodamine-coupled antibody. Particular regions of this occurrence graph can then be selected and a new image composed which shows only those pixels corresponding to a given ratio of red to green or a three color image in which the selected pixels are shown in blue and the others are shown in their original red and green color. The AVS modules written by us for this processing are written in C and are available upon request.",

We quantitated the relationship between the distribution of HBsAg and ER markers by analyzing threedimensional double fluorescence data collected with confocal microscopy. Fig. 4 a shows a plot of the pixels in a single section of the confocal data resolved into their fluorescein (1D3-PDI-horizontal; shown separately in 4 c) and rhodamine (anti-HBsAg-vertical; shown separately in 4 b) intensifies. The strong, heavily populated diagonal corresponds to the bulk of the pixels in the image for which the ratio of PDI to HBsAg is relatively constant. The pixels which form a separate population at ~15 degrees from the vertical correspond to those regions of the image which are rich in HBsAg but have no detectable PDI. These regions are shown in Fig.  4 d in which only the pixels marked in Fig. 4 a were used to compose the image.

After 90 min of cycloheximide treatment (Fig.  5, A and B ) HBsAg still colocalizes with PDI but to a lesser extent than in the normal steady state situation (Fig. 3, a and  b) . After 4 h in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 5 , C and D) the amount of HBsAg in the ER was markedly decreased, and after 6 h (Fig. 5 , E and F) chase, no detectable HBsAg remained colocalized with PDI.

We approached this by studying the time course of intermolecular disulphide bond formation and of particle secretion by pulsechase immunoprecipitation experiments. SV24 cells were pulsed for either 2 or 10 min with radioactive methionine and chased for various times. HBsAg was then immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts and the culture media and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in reducing (+) or nonreducing conditions ( -) (Fig. 6, A and B) . Analysis of the reduced sampies in which all of the HBsAg entered the gel and migrated as monomers (M/gp R and M/p ~ for glycosylated and non- glycosylated forms, respectively) showed that newly synthesized HBsAg was not subjected to significant proteolysis, which would have complicated the kinetic analysis. This agrees with the results of previous experiments with the SV24 cell line which showed that it secretes >95 % of the synthesized HBsAg as lipoprotein particles within 10 h (Simon et al., 1988) . The nonreduced lanes of the gels are conveniently interpreted in terms of our two class description of disulphide bonds in HBsAg. The monomer bands for the gly-cosylated (M/gp N) and the nonglycosylated (M/p N) disappear with the formation of the dimers showing the occurrence of the dimer crosslinks. The formation of oligomer crosslinks is reflected by the occurrence of material which runs at very high molecular weight or does not enter the gel in the nonreduced state.",

We wanted to compare the rates of these processes to those of dimer and oligomer crosslink formation seen above. Fig. 7 A shows an autoradiograph of immunoprecipitates of SV24 culture media after various chase times. These precipitates did not contain any detectable contaminants and hence we quantitated HBsAg secretion by measuring the incorporated radioactivity from the immunoprecipitated secreted particles (Fig. 7 B) . We and others have shown that HBsAg secreted from SV24 and other transfected cells is particulate, as judged by EM and CsCI: centrifugation (Huovila, A.-P. J., and S. D. Fuller, manuscript in preparation; Dubois et al., 1980; Moriarty et al., 1981; Liu et al., 1982; Laub et al., 1983) . This is consistent with the fact that none of the secreted HBsAg entered the gel without reduction (data not shown), indicating all of it was crosslinked in the particles. The approximate half-time for the particle secretion from the SV24 cells in our chase conditions was 2 h. The rates of secretion for the glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms of HBsAg were compared by quantitation of the relative intensities of the corresponding bands for the nonreduced material and can be seen to be identical (Fig. 7 B) .",

In the presence of BfA, newly synthesized HBsAg is converted from monomers to dimers, however, the dimers accumulate and do not proceed to form oligomer crosslinks. The rate of dimer formation is approximately the same as in the non-BfA-treated cells represented in Fig. 6 . Hence the formation of oligomer crosslinks in HBsAg requires exit from the ER.

As a control, lysate from cells infected with wild type baculovirus was used. The effect of increasing amounts of the PDI-containing lysate is the conversion of the oligomeric forms of HBsAg to the dimeric form ( Fig. 9 C) . The level of monomer remains approximately the same. Although secreted HBsAg contains no monomer, the prolonged incubation with glutathione causes the direct conversion of a small fraction of the oligomer to monomer. This can also be observed in incubations in which no cell lysate has been added (data not shown). This experiment shows that the oligomer crosslinks of HBsAg particles are not stable in the presence of PDI although the dimer crosslink formation is promoted.",

Quantitation of confocal microscope data showed that the exclusion of PDI was abrupt and suggested that the HBsAg enriched regions were distinct from the ER. The observation that the fraction of HBsAg segregated to this region increases during incubations with cycloheximide while the amount in the ER decreases shows that this region corresponds to a later and rate limiting step in HBsAg maturation. In agreement with previous work on other cell lines (Patzer et al., 1984) , our biochemical data showed that intracellular HBsAg remained endoglycosidase H sensitive and hence must be in a premedial Golgi compartment. This is reinforced by the immunocytochemical observation that treatment of cells with BfA has no effect on the morphology of the PDI excluding region in which HBsAg is concentrated. Since BfA is known to have a dramatic effect on the distribution of Golgi markers including those of the cis-Golgi, this shows that HBsAg is concentrated in a pre-Golgi compartment.",

The oligomer (--m-) components are the combination of the material that did not enter the separating gel (Wells) and the very high molecular weight material that enters the gel and disappears after DTT reduction. The specific effect of increased PDI expression in the lysate is the conversion of the oligomeric forms of HBsAg to dimers. tant with oligomer formation, HBsAg becomes resistant to protease digestion from the cytosolic side and becomes carbonate extractable (Simon et al., 1988) reflecting the budding of the oligomer into the lumen. Host membrane proteins are excluded from these oligomers, perhaps as a result of the tight interaction between HBsAg dimers. After budding into this compartment, the crosslinked, oligomeric, lipoprotein particles pass rapidly through the Golgi where they acquire endoglycosidase H resistance before their secretion into the medium.",

Newly synthesized HBsAg is translocated into the ER lumen (ER) where disulphide-linked dimers form rapidly in the presence of PDI. Dimers are then transported to an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (IC), where HBsAg forms higher oligomers and assembles into extensively disulphide crosslinked particles. This assembly process is the rate limiting step in the I-IBsAg particle secretion. The mature particles are then transported rapidly through the Golgi and are secreted. The depiction of the dimer and oligomer crosslinks should be interpreted schematically.",

Virion formation makes use of all three forms of the glycoprotein, S (24 kD, which we have described in this work) and the two longer forms $2 (31 kD) and S1 (39 kD) which are produced from three in frame ATGs in the S gene (Ganem and Varmus, 1987) . $2 and S are found in both the virion and the lipoprotein particles while S1 is found only in the virion. An appealing hypothesis is that the virion incorporates the dimeric forms of the glycoprotein (S, S1, $2, and hybrids) before they exit from the ER while the excess S and $2 dimers are transported to an intermediate compartment in which maturation to lipoprotein particles occurs. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that coexpression of the longer S1 form of the HBsAg glycoprotein blocks the secretion of all forms of I-IBsAg (Pershing et al., 1986) . Since the S1 form has been shown to have a retention signal (Kuroki et al., 1989) , formation of oligomers with the other forms of HBsAg would prevent their transport and maturation. The scavenging of the S1 form by budding virions would then allow the other forms to proceed to the intermediate compartment and to lipoprotein particle formation.",

Elegant studies of the biosynthesis of a number of membrane and secretory proteins have resulted in the concept of quality control (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989) , which posits that only properly disulphide-linked and oligomerized proteins are allowed to leave the ER. Although this has been ably demonstrated for simple oligomers, the case of highly crosslinked particles such as that formed by HBsAg is more complex. The initial disulphide-linked dimers appear to meet the normal requirements of quality control and hence they exit from the ER. The later pre-Golgi step of maturation occurs in a distinct, intermediate compartment. A second quality control step occurs here which prevents the further transport of immature HBsAg; only HBsAg in lipoprotein particles transits the Golgi as shown by the correspondence of endoglycosidase H resistance, carbonate extractability and secretion. A similar two-stage assembly and control process also seems to occur for the von Willebrand factor (reviewed by Wagner, 1990) which functions in blood vessel injury repair, hemostasis, and in promoting endothelial cell adhesion. This glycoprotein is found in the plasma as a series of disulphide crosslinked multimers built from a single subunit. These large multimers appear to be formed in transor post-Golgi compartments. The two-stage nature of quality control is reflected in the fact that only after protein has dimerized in the ER is it transported from this compartment and that only crosslinked forms are secreted from the cell. In both cases, exit from the ER precedes the formation of the highly crosslinked oligomers.",

We use the word \"compartment\" to mean a region that lies on the secretory pathway, is distinct in composition from the compartments which precede and follow it, and is morphologically distinct from other compartments. Clearly, the compartment in which oligomer crosslinks are formed in the HBsAg lipoprotein particle lies on the secretory pathway since the overwhelming majority of the HBsAg is eventually secreted from cells. The composition of this compartment is distinct from that of the ER since it lacks soluble ER proteins and from that of the Golgi since it lacks the enzymes responsible for conferring endoglycosidase H resistance. The morphological separation of the compartment is demonstrated by our immunocytochemistry which shows that the region from which PDI is excluded is far larger than that corresponding to an HBsAg particle and by the observation that HBsAg segregation is unaffected by BfA treatment.",

            "text": "The finding that assembly of HBsAg dimers into the secreted lipoprotein particle occurs in an intermediate compartrnent between the ER and the Golgi ascribes a new role to this compartment in biosynthesis. Saraste and Kuismanen (1984) first identified this compartment by showing that at 15~ the transport of viral membrane glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi complex in BHK cells was blocked reversibly. The protein could leave the ER but failed to enter the Golgi, accumulating in a tubulovesicular compartment distinct from the ER and the Golgi. An important and, to many workers, defining function is the retrieval of the soluble resident ER proteins containing the KDEL retention sequence at their carboxy termini, such as PDI and BiP (Munro and Pelham, 1987) . Munro and Pelham (1987) hypothesized the existence of a salvage compartment from which escaped KDEL terminated proteins could be retrieved by recycling to the ER. Since the extensive disulphide crosslinking is a consequence of the exclusion of PDI it is likely that the compartment in which oligomer crosslinks form is either identical to or later than the salvage compartment. We have also shown here that rab2, an established marker of an intermediate compartment (Chavier et al., 1990) is found in the HBsAg enriched, PDI excluding regions. This salvage compartment has been proposed to be the same as the 15~ compartment (Lippincott-Schwartz, 1990; Pelham, 1988 Pelham, , 1989 Vaux et al., 1990 , Warren, 1987 , although colocalization with a viral glycoprotein under conditions of 15~ block has not yet been published. Although a number of authors refer to \"the\" ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, the diversity of functions that have been attributed to it open the possibility that this compartment is heterogeneous. An ER-Golgi intermediate compartment has been identified as the site of the interaction of MHC class I with antigen (Cox et al., 1989; Nuchtern et al., 1989; Yewdell et al., 1989) , and several proteins including p53 and p58, two transmembrane proteins of still unknown function (Schweizer et al., 1988; Saraste and Svensson, 1991) , have been localized to it. Tooze et al. (1988) showed that the first step of the O-glycosylation of a coronavirus glycoprotein, the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine, occurred in the same ER-Golgi intermediate compartment as budding of viral particles. Palmitoylation of proteins (Bonatti et al., 1989 ) and the initial step in the formation of the lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate targeting signal, the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-l-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-l-phosphate to newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes have also been shown to occur in a post-ER pre-Golgi compartment (Rizzolo et al., 1985; Kornfeld, 1988, Komfeld and Mellman, 1989; Lazzarino and Gabel, 1988; Pelham, 1988) . Recent work shows that these functions may be in distinct compartments between the ER and the Golgi complex. Schweizer et al. (1991) isolated a fraction from Veto cells that is enriched in p53 and has properties different from either the ER or the cis-Golgi. Further, Bonatti et al. (1989) demonstrated that protein palmitoylation occurs in a compartrnent which is later than the 15~ block but before mannosidase I trimming of glycans. We are pursuing experiments to further characterize the compartment which is involved in the maturation of HBsAg lipoprotein particles and to relate it to other markers of this region.",
