Viral behaviour may be influenced by the differentiation state of the host cell in the nervous system. For example, the behaviour of Japanese encephalitis virus within the brain of Fischer rats is determined by the maturity of its hosts' neurons [ 11. Animals infected prior to age 13 days die, but those infected after age 14 days do not. Furthermore, kinetic studies showed that viral antigen disappears from the cerebral cortex as neuronal maturation occurrs. Similarly, Sindbis, an alphavirus, causes cytolysis of most dividing cells, but establishes a persistent infection in post-mitotic neurons. Levine et al.",

Transfection of a non-neuronal cell line with a Bcl-2-expressing plasmid is able to prevent Sindbis-induced death, but the virus is then able to persist and replicate [ 2**]. Thus, by counteracting cell apoptosis, Bcl-2 activity may be involved in the persistence of some viruses within the CNS.",

The virus may subsequently reactivate with the possibility of spread to a new host. The immune system clearly plays a role in the control of the primary infection and reactivation [ 41, but during the latent phase, the virus expresses no protein and so it is invisible to the immune system. Therefore, control of expression during latency and the initial signal to reactivation must fundamentally lie with the transcription factor environment of the neuron. This is reflected in the fact that in humans the virus can reactivate spontaneously despite well developed immunity. the infected neonatal mice do show, however, a growth retardation syndrome that is linked to a persistent infection of the pituitary gland [ 51. De la Torre and Oldstone [+I, using a rat pituitary cell line that produces growth hormone and prolactin, have demonstrated that these pituitary cells support LCMV replication without structural damage, but show a livefold reduction in growth hormone mRNA, and, furthermore, that continued viral replication was needed to maintain this effect. This raises the possibility that similar persistent viral infections may be involved in producing neurological disease in humans without producing changes that would be detectable on even the most careful histopathological examination.",

The immunologically priviledged status of the nervous system may be one reason why viruses are able to persist at this site. Even so, the immune response engendered by the virus may cause damage to the CNS, as in the case of Theiler's virus, a picornavirus that establishes a persistent infection in the nervous system [7] . The response to HSV type 1 has also been described as causing a (late phase) multifocal demyelination within the CNS, the pattern of the disease varying according to the genetic background of mouse used [8] . Hence, the immune response within the nervous system provides examples both of rather special ized effector functions, and of novel pathologies that arise from the interaction between virus and the host defence system.",

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are expressed at comparatively low levels within the CNS. The lack of MHC expression on neurons, in particular, has been invoked to explain the ability of a number of viruses to persist in these cells and the inability of MHC class l-restricted T cells to recognize and kill virally infected neurons [9]. Joly et al. [10*-l conclude that neuronal cells do not express sufficient MHC molecules to act as targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), but that this can be overcome by adding interferon gamma, which upregulates MHC expression. This failure of neurons to present antigens in association with MHC appears to result from a down-regulation of peptide-transporting proteins Tap 1 and 2 (or Ham 1 and 2) the levels of which can also be increased by interferon gamma [lo**]. This may be a means by which, except in very cytopathic infections, neurons harbouring viral antigen escape CTL destruction. Although protection of these irreplaceable cells may be seen to be of value for the host, the avoidance of immune eradication may thus contribute to viral persistence [ 111.",

            "text": "In certain viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathological effects seen in the CNS may result from the (appropriate) release of soluble mediators. The neuronal loss seen in a murine model of retrovirus-induced spongiform encephalopathy, is not due to direct neuronal infection, but arises secondarily to infection of non-neuronal cells [ 151. The selective tropism of HIV in the brain does not, directly, explain the neuropathologies seen in this condition. In the late stages of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) there appears to be a state of immune activation within the CNS, with the production of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL)-1, IL6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, mainly distributed in endothelium and stellate parenchymal cells, probably microglia [ 161. In addition, elevated levels of TNF-a have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HIVpositive patients with neurological disorders [ 171. It is possible that these cytokines could play a role in inducing the brain pathology. However, in vitro evidence suggests that the release of HIV antigens, such as tat and gp120, from infected macrophages may also have a role in inducing cell damage [ 181. Inilammatory mediators, such as leukotriene-B4 and prostaglandinD2, are also elevated in the CSF of patients with neurological complications of HIV 1191. Hence, although cytokines may prove to be important in the induction of neuropathology, they are not the only molecules that can mediate this effect. On the other hand, cytokines may also be involved in determining the behaviour of the virus itself. Swingler, Easton and Morris 1201 found that in an in vitro system certain cytokines could augment the expression of a reporter gene driven by the long-terminal repeat region of HIV.",

This implies that a novel antiviral mechanism is active, probably involving the endocytosis of antibody [23*]. Another novel mechanism involving antibody-mediated control of virus replication in nerve cells involves Sindbis virus. Levine et al. [24] studied the antibody-mediated clearance of Sindbis virus from the brain of mice with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). This was achieved without neuronal destruction and did not involve ADCC or complementmediated lysis. It was, however, associated with decreased viral RNA in cells -as determined by in situ hybridization -suggesting interruption at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, the likelihood of recrudescence of disease from the persistent virus varies according to the antibody used to effect the control of the initial infection [ 251. The influence of the quality of the initial antibody responsegenerated in an infection -on the likelihood of disease arising from persistent virus is a point worth bearing in mind in the design of vaccines.",

Immunosuppression may allow a usually innocuous virus to cause progressive cell destruction, as seen in progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy in which JC virus, a polyoma virus, causes destruction of oligodendrocytes [27] . The interaction of viral factors with the effects of immunosuppression in the control of viral behaviour is demonstrated in experiments with the in1814 mutant of HSV type 1. (The in1814 mutant has an insertion in the tegument protein, Vmw65 -IX TIF, transinducing factor abolishing its activity 1281. When HSV infects a cell, Vmw65 is thought to interact with a cellular protein, Ott 1, to form a complex capable of transactivating herpes immediate-early genes [29, 301.) Wild-type HSV establishes a latent infection in Balb/c mice but is lethal to SCID mice. In immune competent mice, in1814 establishes latency, but does not replicate. In SCID mice, however, it is able to establish a slowly progressive productive infection in the CNS [31]. This system illustrates features required if a virus is to produce a persistent infection, namely a low destructive capacity combined with the avoidance of the immune response, the latter due either to virus specific mechanisms, or to immunosuppression of the host.",

The authors propose that virally infected neurons avoid cytotoxic Tcell destruction by failing to express MHC class 1 molecules. This is associated with low levels of MHC class 1 mRNA, and of the mRNA for the peptide transporters required for the loading of viral peptides on to the MHC class 1 molecules. 11.
