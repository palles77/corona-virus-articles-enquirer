There is no vaccine or antiviral drug currently available for human use. Compounds containing quinoline scaffold were shown to inhibit flavivirus NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) with good potencies. In this study, we screened quinoline derivatives, which are known antimalarial drugs for inhibition of DENV2 and West Nile virus (WNV) replication using the corresponding replicon expressing cell-based assays. Amodiaquine (AQ), one of the 4-aminoquinoline drugs, inhibited DENV2 infectivity measured by plaque assays, with EC 50 and EC 90 values of 1.08 \u00b1 0.09 lM and 2.69 \u00b1 0.47 lM, respectively, and DENV2 RNA replication measured by Renilla luciferase reporter assay, with EC 50 value of 7.41 \u00b1 1.09 lM in the replicon expressing cells. Cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) in BHK-21 cells was 52.09 \u00b1 4.25 lM. The replication inhibition was confirmed by plaque assay of the extracellular virions as well as by qRT-PCR of the intracellular and extracellular viral RNA levels. AQ was stable for at least 96 h and had minor inhibitory effect on entry, translation, and post-replication stages in the viral life cycle. DENV protease, 5 0 -methyltransferase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase do not seem to be targets of AQ. Both p-hydroxyanilino and diethylaminomethyl moieties are important for AQ to inhibit DENV2 replication and infectivity. Our results support AQ as a promising candidate for anti-flaviviral therapy.",

For viral RNA replication, cis-acting RNA elements encoded within the 5 0 -and 3 0 -untranslated regions (UTR), coding regions within the N-terminal capsid protein and the C-terminal envelope as well as the 7 NS proteins are sufficient (for excellent reviews, see Lindenbach et al., 2007; Paranjape and Harris, 2010; Villordo and Gamarnik, 2009; Westaway et al., 2003) . To study the cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting viral and host factors required for replication, subgenomic replicons have been constructed for several flaviviruses, Kunjin (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997) , WNV (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2002) , YFV (Jones et al., 2005a) , DENV2 (Alvarez et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005b;  Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Antiviral Research j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / a n t i v i r a l Manzano et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2007) , and DENV4 (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2010) . Stable replicon expressing cell lines have been used in screening antiviral compounds as potential inhibitors of viral replication (for reviews, see Noble et al., 2010; Sampath and Padmanabhan, 2009 ). Since flavivirus RNA encodes several enzymes that play important roles in the virus life cycle, in vitro assays have been developed for screening antiviral compounds. For example, in vitro assays for the two-component viral protease, NS2B-NS3pro (Lai et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2008; Yusof et al., 2000) , 5 0 -RNA methyltransferase catalyzed by the N-terminal domain of NS5 (Dong et al., 2008b; Egloff et al., 2002; Ray et al., 2006) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzed by the C-terminal domain of NS5 (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010 Niyomrattanakit et al., , 2011 . These assays have been useful to identify inhibitors of protease (Ezgimen et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2013) , 5 0 -RNA methyltransferase reviewed in Dong et al., 2008b) , and RdRp (Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011) by small molecule compounds.",

The virus titers from indirect plaque assays (Fig. 4C , open bars) showed significant inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ at 5 lM similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, A and B. However, in the direct plaque assay, since AQ was present only during adsorption, the plaque titer at 5 lM AQ was not significantly different from the titer at 1 lM and its DMSO control (Fig. 4C, stippled bars) .

In (1), a mixture of AQ and DENV2 (MOI of 1) were incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C prior to addition to BHK-21 cells. In (2), AQ and DENV2 (MOI of 1) were simultaneously added to BHK-21 cells. In both cases, after adsorption, the cells were washed and incubated with maintenance medium in the absence of AQ. In (3), AQ was added to BHK-21 cells at post-adsorption with DENV2 and it was present throughout post-infection period up to 72 h. Supernatants were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection for plaque assay (Fig. 4D) . Results indicated that the inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ was maximum (P90% reduction of plaque titer from its DMSO control) at 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig. 4D , striped bar). These results indicated that the major step for inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ is post-entry and fusion events, possibly at viral translation, replication, or assembly of the virus. (MOI of 1) and treated with AQ (5 lM) or no-AQ control (1% DMSO) during infection and post-infection. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C and intracellular and extracellular RNAs were analyzed by qPCR or by plaque assay as described under Section 2. The relative amounts of viral RNA copy number or PFU in AQ-treated cells were calculated as % of the amounts in AQ-untreated cells. Each sample was tested in duplicate and results were confirmed by three independent experiments. Difference between AQ treated and 1% DMSO-treated groups derived from each approach was evaluated by paired t-test, two tailed. (B) EC 90 values for inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ. BHK-21 cells were infected with DENV2 (MOI of 1) and treated with AQ at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 lM, or infected with DENV2 (MOI of 0.01) and treated with 0. 01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, or with 3 ml of maintenance medium. AQ at 0, 1, 5, 10, or 25 lM in 1% DMSO or 1% DMSO alone, was added and the incubation continued at 37\u00b0C. Supernatants were sampled at 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 , and 96 h post-infection. DENV2 infectivity was analyzed by plaque assay. (C) Measurement of AQ inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by direct plaque assay. BHK-21 cells ($10 5 cells in 1 ml) were seeded into a 12-well plate. AQ at final concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, or 25 lM in 1% DMSO were added to DENV2 (MOI of 0.01) during adsorption for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were washed with PBS and maintained with overlay medium containing 1% methylcellulose without AQ during post-infection as described in Section 2. Plaques (pfu/ml) were counted after 3-4 days of incubation and the titers were normalized using no-AQ control as 100%. Plaque assay was also performed by incubation with AQ at 0, 1, 5, 10, 25 lM in 1% DMSO added during DENV2 infection (MOI of 0.01). AQ was present during post-infection period for 96 h. Supernatants were collected at 96 h post-infection for plaque assay. Titers (PFU/ml) were normalized to those obtained with no-AQ control taken as 100%. Data represented means and SEM of two independent experiments. (D) Order of addition assay. This experiment was performed as described under Section 2. AQ (5 lM in 1% DMSO) and DENV2 (MOI of 1) were treated in one of 3 ways. In (1), AQ and the virus were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min before adsorption to BHK-21 cells for 1 h; in (2), AQ and the virus were added to BHK-21 cells together and incubated for 1 h; in both cases, cells were washed and incubated with the maintenance medium without AQ. In (3), AQ was added after virus adsorption and wash with PBS (post-infection). AQ was present throughout the duration of the experiment. Supernatants were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection for plaque assay. DMSO (1%) alone was used as mock-infection control. Error bars indicated the standard error of the means of experiments done in duplicate. The results were confirmed by an independent set of experiments. (E) Time of addition assay. This experiment was performed as described under Section 2. AQ (5 lM in 1% DMSO) was added to DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells (MOI of 1) at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, or Next, to pinpoint the post-infection stage of inhibition more precisely, we added AQ at 5 lM to DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells (MOI of 1) at various time points post-infection as indicated. Supernatants were collected at 72 h post-infection and were analyzed for time-dependent plaque reduction. The plaque reduction by P90% was found even when the drug was added as late as 15 h post-infection (Fig. 4E) . At 21 h post-infection and later time points, the drug lost its inhibitory effect.",

The incubation with the NS3 helicase released the fluorescein-labeled strand in a time-dependent manner. Although the assay was successful in measurement of the helicase activity of NS3, amodiaquine interfered with the assay due its binding to the substrate as reported previously (O'Neill et al., 1998 ) (data not shown).",

AQ was proven effective against chloroquine-resistant strain (reviewed in O'Neill et al., 1998) . The drug was later withdrawn from long-term antimalarial prophylaxis due to its rare but serious side effects, agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity (WHO 1990, reviewed by Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) . Cochrane systematic review in 1996, however, supported the use of AQ for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Besides, an adverse drug reaction study found no significant difference Fig. 5 . Structural determinants of AQ for inhibition of DENV2 infectivity. BHK-21 cells were infected with DENV2 in duplicate wells at a MOI of 1. AQ at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 lM as well as CQ or AQD8 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, or 50 lM in 1% DMSO were added to the virus-infected cells. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. Supernatants were collected and the virus titers were determined by plaque assay. The EC 90 values were determined as described under Section 2. The results were confirmed by an independent set of experiments. Structures of AQ, CQ, and AQD8 are shown in Fig. S2. among CQ, AQ, and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine antimalarials (reviewed by Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) . This impact enforced WHO 1997 to modify its recommendation such that AQ became an optional treatment of uncomplicated malaria (reviewed by Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) . AQ regimen for antimalarial treatment is 3 days of 600-800 mg/day in an adult. Pharmacogenetic studies have discovered a genetic trait in patient population who are susceptible to an adverse effect of hepatotoxicity due to AQ linked to polymorphisms of CYP2C8 gene, one of the cytochrome P450s. The genetic variants of CYP2C8 gene, CYP2C8 \u2044 2 and CYP2C8 \u2044 3, were reported to be responsible for defective metabolism resulting in slow clearance of AQ (reviewed by Kerb et al., 2009) . The genotypes, CYP2C8 \u2044 2 and CYP2C8 \u2044 3, were recorded in African and Caucasian population with the frequency of 11-17%, and 15%, respectively. Dose-adjustments of AQ and increased safety precautions are required for treatment of patients with these polymorphisms in order to prevent the intoxication. Given the antidengue efficacy shown in this study, AQ is likely to become a powerful candidate for treatment of DENV infected patients.",

Time-course analysis suggested that the drug was stable and reproducibly inhibited DENV2 infectivity up to 96 h post-infection. We also learned that the viral entry and internalization was partially inhibited by the drug but the major effect of drug occurred at a later stage of the viral life cycle up to 15 h post-infection. This effect of AQ at early stages (adsorption/ entry) would be absent in replicon-expressing cells and hence the EC 50 values are higher (Table 1 and Fig. 2) . AQ was also ineffective to inhibit replication that is already established as seen in the time of addition assays. A previous study showed that DENV2 replication starts 12 h post-infection as suggested by rapid increase of intracellular RNA levels in BHK-21 cells quantified by qRT-PCR (Shrivastava et al., 2011) . In this study, we have shown that the drug was less effective when added later than 15 h post-infection as measured by viral infectivity (Fig. 4E-F) . Based on our results, we conclude that early stages of virus life cycle including translation, assembly of viral replicase complex and initiation of viral RNA replication could be targets of AQ.",

The crystal structure of two molecules of AQ in complex with histamine-N-methyltransferase at the SAM binding pocket, and the nearby outer pocket were solved (Horton et al., 2005) . Another crystal structure of AQ in complex with phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase from Plasmodium falciparum at SAM binding pocket was also reported . However, our results excluded the 5 0 -RNA methyltransferase and the RdRP activities of NS5 as well as the protease activity of NS3 as the targets of AQ. Viral replication requires both viral and host factors (reviewed in Bollati et al., 2010; Ivanyi-Nagy and Darlix, 2012; Sampath and Padmanabhan, 2009) . It is possible that AQ targets a nonstructural protein without an enzymatic function or an unknown host factor(s) required for replication. Isolation and characterization of AQ-resistant mutants and mapping these mutations by sequence analysis might reveal the identity of the putative viral target. Although most of the DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells die within 12 days in the presence of 5 lM AQ (unpublished results), a longer incubation period, up to 30 days, might yield escape mutants (Teramoto et al., 2008 ). An in vitro RdRP system (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Nomaguchi et al., 2003) could provide an insight into whether the replication initiation factors of viral replication are targets of AQ.",

            "text": "CQ seems to have diverse antiviral effects depending on the virus. For example, in the HIV-1 infection of primary, or established T or monocytes, CQ did not seem to inhibit entry or production of steady state levels of HIV-1 mRNA but did affect the production of HIV-1 virions (Sperber et al., 1993) . CQ has been reported to increase the intracellular pH and interferes with prM to M cleavage at the virion maturation step in DENV2 life cycle but 100 lM concentration was used in that study (Randolph et al., 1990) . CQ has been used in other therapeutic applications. For example, CQ is being used in a randomized controlled clinical study for treatment of dengue in Vietnamese adults (Tricou et al., 2010) . CQ has also been to have antiviral activities against HIV-1 (Solomon and Lee, 2009; Sperber et al., 1993) and SARS Coronavirus (De Clercq, 2006; Vincent et al., 2005) as well as for treatment of cancer and arthritic diseases. Moreover, ferroquine (FQ), a CQ derivative structurally similar to AQ, inhibited HCV infection at an early step by interfering with fusion (Vausselin et al., 2013) and had minor inhibitory effects on viral replication and assembly. From the currently available data, we conclude that each quinoline compound interferes at a different stage in flaviviral life cycle. Further studies are required to identify the target and precise step that is targeted by AQ as well as derivatives of the drug that are least cytotoxic for treatment of DENV infected patient population.",
