It is believed that the masks were taken by staff and others because of a perceived need to protect themselves outside of the hospital setting. Control of airborne transmission from spreading throughout a hospital appears to be a critical factor. An early report from Hong Kong 8 theorized that the SARS outbreak at a public hospital could have been associated with the use of nebulized bronchodilator treatments in the index patient and transmission could have been increased by the use of diagnostic sputum induction, bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and airway suction. SCVMC used HEPA filtration devices because negative airflow rooms were not available. The use of the HEPA filter does not take the place of putting the patient into a negative air pressure room, but it can serve to cleanse some of the air in the room being used.",

            "text": "The prospect of having SARS is alarming to patients and visitors. It is important to not only treat the patient's symptoms but also to educate about how the syndrome is diagnosed, treated, and prevented. The CDC offers information on its Web site. 13 If patients are to be isolated at home, they should be instructed to comply with strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease. This includes a self-quarantine for a minimum of 10 days after the disappearance of symptoms. Specific information about isolation and quarantine can be obtained from the CDC Web site. 14 SUMMARY SARS has created a great deal of concern and public attention. SCVMC was thrust into the national news spotlight when patients were removed from a flight and taken to the facility. The aforementioned case reports describe how the staff had less than 1 month to become aware of, prepare for, and treat a potential public health disaster. The resources, clinical trials, and lessons learned are shared with readers to help others to learn from this experience.",
