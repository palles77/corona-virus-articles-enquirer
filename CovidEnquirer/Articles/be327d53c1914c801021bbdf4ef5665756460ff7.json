            "text": "Genetic change was a prerequisite for the early life forms to be generated and maintained (Chapter 1), and it is also a requirement for the evolution of present-day life. We may willingly or inadvertently modify selective pressures, but genetic change is rooted in all replication machineries. Viruses use the same molecular mechanisms of genetic variation than any other form of life: mutation, hypermutation, several types of recombination, and genome segment reassortment. Mutation is observed in all viruses, with no known exceptions. Recombination is also widespread, but its role in the generation of diversity appears to vary among viruses. Its occurrence was soon accepted for DNA viruses, but it was considered uncertain for the RNA viruses. Pioneer studies by P. D. Cooper and colleagues with poliovirus (PV) and by A.M. King and colleagues with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) provided the first evidence of recombination in RNA. The present perception is that recombination is more widespread than thought only a few decades ago, but that its frequency and the types of genomic forms it generates vary among viruses. For example, as a general rule, it appears that positive strand RNA viruses recombine more easily than negative strand RNA viruses to give rise to mosaic genomes of standard length. Several negative strand RNA viruses, however, can yield defective genomes through recombination, frequently characterized by deletions in their RNA. Genome segment reassortment, the 2.2 MOLECULAR BASIS OF MUTATION variation event in viruses closest to chromosomal exchanges in sexual reproduction, is obviously privative of segmented viral genomes. The three modes of virus genome variation are not incompatible, and reassortant-recombinant-mutant genomes have been described. The potential for genetic variation of RNA and DNA viral genomes is remarkable, and it is the ultimate molecular mechanism that lies at the origin of the virus diversity delineated in Chapter 1.",

            "text": "Mutation is a localized alteration of a nucleotide residue in a nucleic acid. It generally refers to an inheritable modification of the genetic material. In the case of viral genomes, mutations can result from different mechanisms: (i) template miscopying (direct incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide); (ii) primer-template misalignments that include miscoding followed by realignment, and misalignment of the template relative to the growing chain (polymerase \"slippage\" or \"stuttering\"); (iii) activity of cellular enzymes (i.e., deaminases), or (iv) chemical damage to the viral nucleic acids (deamination, depurination, depyrimidination, reactions with oxygen radicals, direct and indirect effects of ionizing radiation, photochemical reactions, etc.) (Naegeli, 1997; Bloomfield et al., 2000; Friedberg et al., 2006) . The basis of nucleotide misincorporation during template copying lies mainly in the electronic structure of the bases that make up DNA or RNA. Each base in DNA (adenine, A; guanine, G; cytosine, C; thymine, T) and RNA (with uracil, U instead of T) includes potential hydrogen-bonding donor sites (amino or amino protons) and hydrogen-bonding acceptor sites (carbonyl oxygens or aromatic nitrogens) that contribute to standard Watson-Crick base pairs (Figure 2 .1) as well as wobble base pairs (nonstandard Watson-Crick, but fundamental for RNA secondary structure and mRNA translation) (Figure 2 .2). The conformation of the purine and pyrimidine bases is highly dynamic. Amino and methyl groups rotate about the bonds that link them to the ring structure. In dilute solution hydrogen bonds are established with water, and they can be displaced by nucleotide or amino acid residues to give rise to nucleotide-nucleotide or nucleotide-amino acid interactions. The strength difference between hydrogen bonds established in a polynucleotide chain with water, and their strength between two bases in separate polynucleotide chains determines whether a double-stranded polynucleotide will be stably formed.",

            "text": "Purine and pyrimidine bases can acquire different charge distributions and ionization states. As a consequence, in addition to the standard Watson-Crick and wobble, other base pairs are found in naturally occurring nucleic acids (notably cellular rRNA and tRNA) and in synthetic oligonucleotides (A-U or A-T Hoogsteen, and A-G, C-U, G-G, and U-U pairs, as well as interactions involving ionized bases). One of the types of electronic redistribution leads to tautomeric changes, such as the keto-enol and amino-imino transitions, which modify the hydrogen-bonding properties of the base; tautomeric imino and enol forms of the standard bases can produce non-Watson-Crick pairs. The proportion of the alternative tautomeric forms can be influenced by modifications in the purine and pyrimidine rings, which in turn can favor either the syn or anti conformation of a nucleoside, which is defined by the torsion angle of the bond between the 1\u2032 carbon of the ribose and either N1 in pyrimidines or N9 in purines (Figure 2 .1). The anti conformation is usually the more stable in standard nucleotides and polynucleotides. The transition from the anti to the syn conformation may alter the hydrogen-bonding properties of the base thereby inducing mutagenesis (Bloomfield et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2006) . The understanding of conformational effects on the base-pairing tendencies of nucleoside analogs in the context of the active site of a polymerase is very relevant to the design of specific mutagenic analogs for viral polymerases (Chapter 9).",

They may alter cis-acting regulatory elements in viral genomes, decrease the stability of duplex structures stabilized between viral sequences and miRNAs or siRNAs, and promote alterations of viral gene expression or escape from RNA interference (Lafforgue et al., 2011; Nevot et al., 2011) . Silent mutation-dependent modification of secondary or higher order structures of genomic RNA or messenger RNAs may have several effects including splicing precision or translation fidelity through the modification of RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions. Synonymous codons use different tRNAs for protein synthesis, and different tRNAs do not have the same relative abundance in different host cells. Thus, the rate of protein synthesis, an extremely important phenotypic trait for cells and viruses, can be affected by the frequency of alternative synonymous codons present in a mRNA (Richmond, 1970; Akashi, 2001) . Not only does codon bias affect the level of gene expression, but rare codon distribution may regulate the folding of nascent proteins during translation (Makhoul and Trifonov, 2002; Rocha, 2004; Aragones et al., 2010) . As a consequence, generation of rare codons by mutation of abundant codons (or vice versa) can modify viral replicative capacity (or fitness, Chapter 5). Rare codons may also limit the fidelity of amino acid incorporation when the frequency of the required aminoacyl-tRNAS is low (Ling et al., 2009; Zaher and Green, 2009; Czech et al., 2010) . The frequency of codon pairs in RNA genomes is also a fitness determinant currently under investigation to prepare attenuated viral vaccines. In Chapter 4, additional evolutionary events related to virus-host interactions that might have contributed to codon bias are discussed.",

The effect of evolutionary distance on the transition to transversion ratio was observed in the FMDV sequence comparison carried out in our laboratory over several decades, that ranged from analyses of mutant spectra relative to their corresponding consensus sequence to the comparison of independent viral isolates from a disease outbreak [reviews of the work on FMDV evolution in (Domingo et al., 1990 (Domingo et al., , 2003 ]. These two levels of sequence analyses (quasispecies vs.independent isolates) can be further understood by comparing Chapters 3 and 7.

In this situation, \u03c9 will indicate purifying selection despite a critical role of positive selection triggered by one or few nonsynonymous mutations in the evolutionary outcome which are insufficient to compute as \u03c9 > 1 (Crandall et al., 1999) . (iii) In a striking proof of the above arguments, statistically significant mutational biases led to a value of \u03c9 indicative of positive selection in an in vitro evolution experiment simulating pseudogene evolution in which positive selection was not possible (Vartanian et al., 2001) . (iv) A synonymous change may permit a codon to acquire a relevant nonsynonymous change through a point mutation. The term quasisynonymous has been used to describe codons that encode the same amino acid, but that have a different evolutionary potential regarding the accesible amino acids in the encoded protein. Alternative codons for a given amino acid approximate a replicative system to points of sequence space from which a phenotypically relevant change has a different probability (Chapters 3 and 4).

The homopolymeric tract constitutes a hot spot for variation due to polymerase slippage (Figure 2 .4b). The elongation of the internal oligoadenylate was dramatic, but it was only observed when FMDV was subjected to repeated plaque-to-plaque (bottleneck) transfers, not to large population passages. In fact, this drastic genetic modification has not been recorded among natural isolates of the virus. The molecular instruction to elongate the oligoadenylate was very strong because it was observed in many independent biological clones subjected to bottleneck transfers (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1996) . Despite qualifying as a hot spot for variation, the first event in fitness recovery when the clones were subjected to large population passages was the reversion of the elongated tract to its original size (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1999) . The interpretation of these findings, to be further analyzed in Chapter 6, is that during plaque-to-plaque transfers the negative selection to eliminate unfit genomes is less intense than during large, highly competitive population passages. Again, a clear molecular instruction to elongate a homopolymeric track may not be reflected in a high frequency of the affected genomes. Therefore, although mutation rates and frequencies for viruses bear some relationship, rates cannot be inferred from frequencies and vice versa (Figure 2 .5).",

Drake, who pursued comparative measurements that have generally supported a difference between mutation rates for DNA and RNA viruses. The rates estimated for bacteriophages \u03bb and T4 were about 100 times higher than those of their host E. coli. An approximately constant rate of 0.003 mutations per genome per replication round was calculated for a number DNA-based microbes (Drake, 1991) , an observation sometimes referred to as \"Drake's rule.\" This rather surprising constancy suggests that different DNA organisms have accommodated the template-copying fidelity of their replication machineries to achieve a narrow window in the mutational load measured as mutations fixed per genome, a remarkable fitting of biochemistry with evolutionary needs. The basal mutation rate in mammalian cells has been estimated at about 10 \u221210 substitutions per nucleotide and cell generation [reviewed in (Naegeli, 1997; Domingo et al., 2001; Friedberg et al., 2006) ] (Table 2 .1).",

The latter value is in agreement with a rate of 3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 to 4 \u00d7 10 \u221210 substitutions per base pair and generation based on whole genome pyrosequencing of an experimentally evolved lineage of Myxococcus xanthus (Velicer et al., 2006) . Mutation rates in cells and viruses depend on the replicative machinery (generally a multiprotein complex that includes the relevant viral polymerase with additional viral and host proteins and membrane structures) and on multiple environmental parameters. Whether bacteria are in the exponential or stationary phase of growth can affect intracellular metabolites and proton exchange rates which, in turn, may alter the proportion of tautomeric forms in nucleotides and misincorporation tendencies (Friedberg et al., 2006) . The sequence context of the template nucleic acids (presence of repeated sequences that can induce misalignment mutagenesis or G-C vs. A-T rich regions in relation to relative nucleotide substrate abundances, etc.) may impel or attenuate mutability. Insertion elements may enhance mutation rates at neighboring sites in a bacterial genome (Miller and Day, 2004) . Despite these influences, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) displayed comparable mutation rates in several host cells (Combe and Sanjuan, 2014) suggesting that there is a limited range of average error rates needed for a virus to maintain fitness (Chapters 5 and 9).",

High copying fidelity is typical of DNA polymerases involved in cellular DNA replication, and low copying fidelity is generally a feature of DNA polymerases involved in DNA repair (Friedberg et al., 2006) . Thus, repair of lesions that by themselves might not be mutagenic may lead to the introduction of mutations during the error-prone repair process. (ii) Expression of proteins active in repair encoded in the viral genome, such as uracil-DNA glycosylase, DNA repair endonucleases, etc. (iii) The mechanism of viral DNA replication, particularly the occurrence of double-stranded versus single-stranded DNA in replicative intermediates. (iv) The intracellular site of replication and the availability of postreplicative DNA repair proteins (regarding both intracellular location and concentration) to the viral replication factories. Little is known of the spatial relationships and relative affinities of cellular and viral proteins and structures that may critically affect polymerase fidelity. Comparative measurements of mutation rates at specific genome sites of DNA viruses are needed, as a first step to define the cellular and biochemical influences on the fidelity of DNA virus genome replication. General genetic variability affecting the entire virus genome should be distinguished from localized variability at hot spots in a genome. Even the extremely complex human genome shows genetic instability at specific loci, some associated with genetic disease (Domingo et al., 2001; Alberts et al., 2002; Bushman, 2002) . Genome size is a parameter pertinent to biological behavior, not only because it imposes a commensurate copying fidelity, but also because it affects the impact of genetic heterogeneity within infected organisms, and upon invasion of new hosts (Chapter 3).",

The technical details of any procedure used to calculate a mutation frequency should be carefully evaluated to translate its meaning to the genome level. Important variables are the efficacy of the antibody or drug (which will be concentration dependent) or the possibility of phenotypic hiding-mixing in the escape mutants to be quantified (Holland et al., 1989; Valcarcel and Ortin, 1989) . Unexpected low levels of escape mutants (that would imply <10 \u22126 substitutions per nucleotide) for an RNA virus can mean either a general or site-specific high polymerase fidelity, a selective disadvantage of the genome that harbors the mutation or, when a phenotypic alteration is measured, the requirement of two or more mutations to produce the alteration. Conversely, a high mutation frequency for a DNA virus whose replication is catalyzed by a high fidelity DNA polymerase may mean that either repair activities were not functional or that the mutant displayed a selective advantage and overgrew the wild type prior to the measurement of its frequency. Mathematical treatments that take into account reversion of a low fitness mutant and its competition with wild-type virus have been used to calculate mutation rates (Batschelet et al., 1976; Coffin, 1990) .",

Historically, a few early studies indicated unusual low mutation rates or frequencies for some RNA viruses. As discussed in some of the reviews listed above, there are technical reasons that suggest that such values were probably underestimates of the true average mutations rates or frequencies. Obviously, it cannot be excluded that some genomic sites or viruses under a given environment are unusually refractory to mutations, but most evidence supports the range of values listed in Table 2 .1. The near million-fold higher mutation rates for RNA viruses than cellular DNA, whose biological implications were presciently anticipated by J. Holland and colleagues (Holland et al., 1982) , have been confirmed. That is, for RNA viruses of genome length between 3Kb and 32 Kb, an average of 0.1-1 mutations are introduced per template molecule copied in the replicating population. Unless most mutations impeded viral replication, a continuous input of mutant genomes is expected, as indeed found experimentally (Chapter 3).",

The change in fidelity can reach almost one order of magnitude, but virus viability is not compromised. Thus, error rates themselves can be subjected to selection, as supported by theoretical studies on evolvability (Earl and Deem, 2004) . It is not clear whether mutation rates of viruses have evolved to procure a balance between adaptability and genetic stability, or whether other selective constraints have imposed the observed values. It has been suggested that because of the generally deleterious nature of most mutations, the adaptive value of the high mutation rates for RNA viruses is debatable, and that there might have been a trade-off between replication rate and copying fidelity (Elena and Sanjuan, 2005) . Mutation rates would be a consequence of rapid RNA replication, and an increase in copying fidelity would come at a cost, resulting in a lower replication rate. A connection between elongation and error rate has been suggested by results with some viral and cellular polymerases [review (Kunkel and Erie, 2005) ]. In an early study with the poliovirus RdRp in vitro, an increase in the error frequency was observed when the pH-Mg 2+ ion conditions were modified, and the decreased fidelity correlated with increased RNA elongation rate (Ward et al., 1988) . A possible connection between elongation rate and copying fidelity cannot be ruled out, but current evidence points to template-copying fidelity as being the result of multiple factors, not necessarily linked to the rate of genome replication (Vignuzzi and Andino, 2010; Campagnola et al. 2015) . Many lines of evidence support an adaptive value of high mutation rates for RNA viruses per se, independently of their biochemical origins. A poliovirus mutant, whose RdRp displayed a three-to fivefold higher fidelity than the wild-type enzyme, replicated at a slightly lower rate than wild-type virus in cell culture, but displayed a strong selective disadvantage regarding invasion of the brain of susceptible 2.6 CONSEQUENCES OF HIGH MUTATION RATES mice (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006) . The impediment to cause neuropathology was due to the limited complexity of the mutant spectrum since its broadening through mutagenesis restored the capacity to produce neuropathology. These and other studies have provided evidence that mutant spectrum complexity, by virtue of its impact on fitness, can be a virulence determinant. The work by M. Vignuzzi, J. Pfeiffer, R. Andino, C. Cameron, K. Kirkegaard, and their colleagues on poliovirus fidelity mutants opened a much needed branch of research in virus evolution and quasispecies implications. As a proof of this statement, the field of fidelity mutants is rapidly expanding, and references to the information they provide will be made in several chapters.",

The coronaviruses have the largest genomes among the known RNA viruses, with 30-33 kb. This is about 10-fold more genetic information than encoded in the simple RNA bacteriophages such as MS2 or Q\u03b2. Coronaviruses are replicated by complex RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which include a domain that corresponds to a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease, proofreading-repair activity. The protein displays exonuclease activity in vitro, and its inactivation affects viral RNA synthesis (Minskaia et al., 2006) , and results in increases of about 15-fold in the average mutation frequency (Eckerle et al., 2007 (Eckerle et al., , 2010 . A coronavirus mutant devoid of this repair function is more susceptible to lethal mutagenesis , as expected from a connection between replication accuracy and proximity to an error threshold for the maintenance of genetic information (Chapter 9). Thus, it is likely that a proofreading activity evolved (or was captured from a cellular counterpart) in RNA genomes whose genomic complexity was in the limit compatible with the fidelity achievable by standard RNA replicases. It would be interesting to discover new RNA viruses with a single RNA molecule longer than 30 Kb as genome to analyze whether they have evolved more accurate core polymerases or exhibit a proofreading-repair function during replication. Toward the other end of the RNA size scale, viroid RNAs display a mutation rate higher than (or close to the highest) recorded for RNA viruses, consistent with the correlation between genome size and template-copying accuracy (Gago et al., 2009) .",

The error rate of the bacteriophage \u03d529 DNA polymerase is about 10 \u22126 without the proofreading exonuclease activity, and it decreases to 10 \u22128 with the correcting activity [(de Vega et al., 2010) and references therein]. Postreplicative repair pathways act on double-stranded DNA, but not (or very inefficiently) on RNA or DNA-RNA hybrids. Therefore, the known postreplicative repair systems that operate in cellular DNA do not make a significant contribution to error correction in RNA viruses.",

Exceptions to the absence of repair activities in simple genetic elements have been described. A satellite RNA of the plant virus turnip crinkle carmovirus evolved a 3\u2032-end RNA repair mechanism. It implicates the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides by the viral replicase using the 3\u2032-end of the viral genome as template. The mechanism consists probably of template-independent priming at the 3\u2032-end of the damaged RNA to generate wild type, negative strand, and satellite RNA (Nagy and Simon, 1997). A reversible, NTP-dependent excision of the 3\u2032residue of the nascent nucleic acid product has been described in some retroviruses and hepatitis C virus (Meyer et al., 1998; Jin et al., 2013) . This activity is important for drug resistance and it may also modulate the overall fidelity of some polymerases. It cannot be excluded that some type of point mutation correction may operate in RNA genetic elements of less than 30 Kb. Such putative mechanisms may even diminish mutation rates that would otherwise be prohibitively deleterious, and they do not overshadow high mutation rates as a feature of RNA and some DNA genomes (Table 2 .1).",

Three-dimensional structures of viral RdRps and RTs indicate that interactions between the incoming nucleotide or residues of the template-primer with amino acids of the polymerase must permit displacement of the growing polymerase chain along the channel located at the palm domain of the polymerase (Steitz, 1999; Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006) (Figure 2 .6b).

One of the several steps involved in nucleotide incorporation is the formation of a ternary complex (polymerase with template-primer and the incoming nucleotide) that undergoes a conformational change (reorientation of the divalent ion-complexed triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide). This conformational change activates the complex for phosphoryl transfer, to link the nucleosidemonophosphate to the 3\u2032-terminus of the primer (or growing chain). Steps involved in the nucleotide incorporation are represented in Figure 2 .6c. Both the conformational change and the relative rate of phosphoryl transfer for an incorrect nucleotide versus the correct nucleotide influence the error rate at each site of the growing chain. Critical kinetic constants in Figure 2 .6c that are determined experimentally to quantify relative nucleotide incorporations and misincorporations are K d,app (expressed as \u03bcM), k pol (expressed as s \u22121 ), and the ratio k pol /K d,app (\u03bcM \u22121 s \u22121 ) termed the catalytic efficiency. The ratio of k pol /K d,app for the incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide to k pol /K d,app for a correct nucleotide gives Polymerization by viral polymerases. (a) The structure of nucleic acid polymerases resembles that of a right hand. This was first evidenced with the structure of the Klenow fragment of the E. coli DNA polymerase I by T.A. Steitz and colleagues in 1985. On the left the Klenow fragment is represented with colored fingers, palm and thumb domains, next to an open right hand. The structure on the right is that of PV RdRp, next to a closed right hand. Courtesy of N. Verdaguer and L. Vives-Adri\u00e1n (the hand is that of L. Vives-Adri\u00e1n). (b) The structure of ternary complex between FMDV 3D, an RNA molecule and UTP as the substrate (PDB id. 2E9Z). The left panel is a front view of the complex, depicting the polymerase chain as a yellow ribbon, the RNA in dark blue (template) and cyan (primer). The incoming UTP and the pyrophosphate product are shown in atom type, and two Mg 2+ ions as magenta balls. The right panel is the same complex in a top-down orientation. (Figure courtesy of C. Ferrer-Orta and N. Verdaguer). (c) Scheme of minimum number of steps involved in nucleotide incorporation. The first step consists of the binding of polymerase 0 E to the template-primer R n (elongated up to nucleotide n) to form a complex 0 ER n . Formation of the activated complex ER n is governed by the rate constant k assembly (k a ). The activated ER n complex binds a nucleotide NTP with an apparent binding affinity given by K d,app to form the ER n NTP complex. Catalysis to incorporate covalently the NTP to the growing primer chain to yield ER n + 1 and pyrophosphate (PP i ) is governed by the rate constant k pol . Other constants depicted in the scheme are the inactivation rate constant (k inact ) of 0 E, and dissociation of E from RNA (k off, ER n and k off , ER n + 1 ). Based on , and previous studies with PV polymerase 3D by C. E. Cameron and his colleagues. the frequency of that particular misincorporation, and an assessment of polymerase fidelity [ (Castro et al., 2005) and references therein].

Structural modifications of viral polymerases that lead to high fidelity have inspired the design and testing of additional substitutions. In this manner, mutant viral polymerases showing either an increase or decrease of copying fidelity achieved through a single amino acid substitution have been characterized (Wainberg et al., 1996; Men\u00e9ndez-Arias, 2002; Mansky et al., 2003; Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003; Arnold et al., 2005; Domingo, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006; Coffey et al., 2011; Gnadig et al., 2012; Meng and Kwang, 2014; Rozen-Gagnon et al., 2014; Borderia et al., 2016) .

            "text": "Some viral genomes either isolated from biological samples or evolved in cell culture show biased mutation types (e.g., monotonous G \u2192 A or C \u2192 U substitutions in the same genome), generally at frequencies of around 10 \u22122 substitutions per nucleotide (10-to 1000-fold higher than standard mutation rates and frequencies) ( Table 2 .1). Biased hypermutation was first observed in some defectiveinterfering (DI) RNAs of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Holland et al., 1982) , and in variant forms of measles virus, associated with postmeasles neurological disease such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Cattaneo and Billeter, 1992) . Hypermutation is mainly due to the activity of cellular deaminases such as, the apolipoprotein B mRNA and the editing complex (APOBEC), or the adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR) families, that are involved in cellular editing and regulatory functions (Sheehy et al., 2002; Santiago and Greene, 2008; Nishikura, 2010; Stavrou et al., 2014) . In the event of a viral infection, such cellular functions can become part of an innate defense mechanism against the invading virus. Viral proteins (i.e., Vif in HIV-1) bind some APOBEC proteins thus inhibiting mutagenesis and permitting virus survival (Sheehy et al., 2002) . In oncoretroviruses, retroviruses, and hepatitis B virus (HBV), the APOBEC-3 cytidine deaminase acts on singlestranded DNA and results mainly in G \u2192 A and C \u2192 U hypermutation, that may affect 40% to 100% of the G residues. The preferred sequence context for G hypermutation in HIV-1 observed in vivo is GpA > GpG > GpT \u2248 GpC. The specific dinucleotide context of the hypermutated sites provides a means to distinguish genomes that have undergone hypermutation by cellular activities from those that are heavily mutated by other mechanism such as the action of mutagenic agents (Chapter 9). The ADAR-associated hypermutation was identified in negative strand RNA riboviruses, and results mainly in A \u2192 G and U \u2192 C hypermutation. It is originated by A \u2192 I (inosine) modification in double-stranded viral RNA catalyzed by ADAR-1 L, one of more than one hundred proteins inducible 2.8 MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC INFORMATION by type I IFN (Maas et al., 2003) . Inosine can be recognized as G by the replication machinery (Valente and Nishikura, 2005) , although it can form wobble base pairs also with A and U (Figure 2.2) .",

            "text": "High mutation rates have practical implications in laboratory studies on the behavior of virus mutants obtained by molecular cloning of a biological sample, or constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. A transition mutation that causes a strong fitness decrease but that still allows residual RNA genome replication, will most likely revert following infection or transfection of cells with the mutant construct. Double or triple mutants (preferentially including transversions) should be engineered (when possible according to the genetic code) to study the behavior of a viral mutant with an amino acid replacement of interest that may produce a fitness decrease. As an example, a C \u2192 U transition found in an openreading frame of an RNA virus may convert a Pro into a Ser (CCG \u2192 UCG). Since Ser will revert to Pro through a U \u2192 C transition in the triplet (a common type of misincorporation by most polymerases), Ser should be engineered to be encoded by AGU; in the course of replication, reversion to Pro would require at least two transversions since the codons for Pro are CCU, CCC, CCA, or CCG. Thus, if effects derived from the difference in primary sequence of the RNA or codon bias do not intervene in the behavior of the viral genome, codons with a high genetic barrier to reversion should be engineered for studies involving viral replication. In general, deletions revert at a much lower frequency than point mutations, and, when appropriate for the question under study, a deletion should be introduced within the gene of interest to probe gene function in reverse genetic studies. High mutation rates also imply that infection or transfection with debilitated mutant viruses may result in progeny with sequences that differ from the input. V. I. Agol and colleagues have coined the term quasi-infectious to refer to mutant viruses that are capable of yielding progeny, but the progeny differs from the initial genome (pseudorevertants) (Gmyl et al., 1993) . The difference between the input mutant and the rescued progeny virus will depend on the type of genetic lesion in the input virus and its consequences for replication. A single point mutation that decreases replication is likely to lead to a true revertant (return to the original sequence). If the same reversion depends on two or more mutations, a true revertant will be generated only after extended replication to achieve the required exploration of sequence space (Chapter 3). In this case, selection of compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome (sometimes referred to as second site revertants) is likely. The term compensatory is often used for mutations that compensate the deleterious effects of other mutations. A typical example is a mutation that decreases the stability of a stem in an RNA stemloop that functions as a cis-acting element. Frequently, a compensatory mutation occurs that restores a stable stem. Thus, an engineered virus may produce progeny which differs from the parent. There is an uncertainty regarding the representativeness of a virus mutant or construct when the objective is to infer the behavior of genetic lesions in the natural context. If a substantial loss of replicative capacity is produced by a drastic genetic change (an indel, loss of a stem-loop structure, etc.) selection of a true revertant becomes extremely unlikely. The compensatory generation of alternative structures (or constellations of point mutations) that restore replication (partially or completely) becomes an interesting and informative possibility.",

If for technical reasons an infectious cDNA clone is constructed from several molecules which were copied from different genomes present in the mutant spectrum, the ligation product may be transcribed into an RNA which is not infectious. This is because while some constellations of mutations may be compatible with infectivity, others may not, or may allow limited, suboptimal replication, thus favoring the selection of additional mutations or reversions. The effect of different mutations in the same genome is often referred to as epistasis. Mutations that reinforce each other with regard to a viral function are said to produce positive epistasis and those that interfere with each other produce negative epistasis. Thus, a mutation may have an effect on its own, and an effect that depends on accompanying mutations in the same genome (also mentioned regarding the context-dependent effect of mutations in Section 2.3). Epistasis in RNA viruses may be blurred by the considerable weight of mutant spectra in determining viral behavior through intergenome interactions (Chapter 3).",

It is a widespread mechanism of genetic variation in all biological systems, and in cells it underlies critical physiological and developmental processes (splicing, generation of diversity in immunoglobulin genes and T cell receptors, transposition events, phase variation in bacteria, repair pathways that promote postreplicative error correction, etc.). Cellular DNA recombination relates to replication, repair, and completion of DNA replication, operations that involve multiple proteins displaying a variety of activities (Smith and Jones, 1999; Alberts et al., 2002; Nimonkar and Boehmer, 2003; Friedberg et al., 2006) . 2.9 RECOMBINATION IN DNA AND RNA VIRUSES Recombination occurs both with DNA and RNA viruses, often with participation of the virus replication machinery. Several types of recombination have been distinguished in viruses: homologous versus nonhomologous recombination, according to the extent of nucleotide sequence identity around the recombination (crossover) site, and replicative versus nonreplicative recombination, according to the requirement of viral genome replication for recombination to occur (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986; King, 1988; Lai, 1992; Nagy and Simon, 1997; Plyusnin et al., 2002; Boehmer and Nimonkar, 2003; Gmyl et al., 2003; Chetverin et al., 2005; Agol, 2010; Simmonds, 2010; Bujarski, 2013) .

It implicates multiple viral gene products (DNA polymerase, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, processivity factors, helicase-primase, eukaryotic topoisomerase I, etc.), and a succession of protein-catalyzed steps. In the copy choice (or template switching) mechanism, the nascent DNA switches from one template molecule to another, resulting in synthesis of recombinant, daughter DNAs. In its basic form, recombination by breakage and rejoining starts with the introduction of a nick at one of the strands of each parental DNA, strand invasion of one parental DNA by the other, branch migration, ligation at the nicks (linking DNA strands from the two parents), and further isomerization and cleavage reactions. DNA recombination is responsible for the endonuclease-mediated isomerization of some herpesvirus genomes [four isomers defined by the orientation of the long (L) and short (S) regions of the viral genome]. During the late phase of herpes simplex virus-1 replication, the frequency of recombination has been estimated at 0.6% per Kb of genome . Integration or excision of proviral DNA or temperate bacteriophage DNA, are examples of site-specific recombination that involves specific enzyme activities (i.e., retroviral integrases), and requires a short stretch of nucleotide sequence identity.",

Given the large numbers of viral genomes often present in replication complexes in each infected cell, it is not surprising that this mechanism may give rise to frequent recombinant progeny genomes. Formation of mosaic genomes has long been recognized as an essential feature of the genetics of some retroviruses and plant RNA viruses. For HIV-1 and some plant RNA viruses recombination frequencies have been estimated at 2% to 10% of progeny per 100 nucleotides; for picornaviruses and coronaviruses the number of recombinants amount to 10% to 20% of the progeny (King, 1988; Lai, 1992; Nagy and Simon, 1997; Levy et al., 2004; Urbanowicz et al., 2005; Sztuba-Solinska et al., 2011) . A phylogenetic approach estimated an average recombination rate of HIV-1 in vivo of 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 recombination events/ site/generation, which is about fivefold greater than the average point mutation rate (Shriner et al., 2004) . Recombination may be inefficient or absent in some negative strand RNA viruses. However, some of them undergo homologous recombination (Plyusnin et al., 2002) , and certainly high frequency recombination in the generation of DI RNAs (Roux et al., 1991) .",

Controlled infection of cells with genetically marked parental viruses has been essential to estimate recombination frequencies, and to distinguish true recombination from mutationreversion events that may mimic the formation of recombinants.

It may be significant that they belong to viral families displaying high recombination frequencies (Makino et al., 1986) .

A commonly used procedure measures similarity values between sequences using a sliding-window scanning method. The recombination crossover point (where the two parental sequences meet) is identified by the point (or region) where the similarity plot crosses from one sequence into another (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004; Martin et al., 2005; Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006) . Crossover points along a viral genome are not distributed at random, either because polymerase detachment from the template is sequence dependent or because many of the recombination events do not lead to viable progeny. Absence of recombinant viability introduces a parallel with the distinction we made in Section 2.5 between mutation rate and frequency; that is, a distinction between what does occur and what is observed. Many newly arising recombinants may be subjected to negative selection, and only a viable subset of all recombinants produced might be detectable in progeny virus (King, 1988; Lai, 1992) . Thus, as in the case of mutations, many recombinant genomes are not detected because of their elimination by negative selection. An elegant study by D.J. Evans and colleagues documented \"imprecise\" enterovirus recombinant intermediates that were lost upon serial virus passage (Lowry et al., 2014) .

In the case of the nanovirus Faba bean necrotic stunt virus, its 8 segments vary in frequency in a host-dependent manner (Sicard et al., 2013) . This observation led the authors to propose a \"setpoint genome formula\" which may reflect a control of segment (gene) copy number that may provide some still unrecognized benefit to the multipartite phenotype (see next section). In principle, replication of multipartite viruses requires that each cell be coinfected by at least one of each type or particle harboring a different genome type, which in fact represents a remarkable cost for replicative efficiency. The fact that unsegmented and segmented RNA viruses are well represented in our biosphere suggests that neither of the two organizations confers a definitive advantage for long-term survival.",

An alternative, not mutually exclusive model, is that genome segmentation may have an advantage because replication of shorter RNA molecules is completed earlier than the unsegmented counterpart (Nee, 1987) .

Its single-stranded RNA genome underwent a modification akin to genome segmentation when the standard virus was subjected to more than 200 passages in BHK-21 cells at high multiplicity of infection. The experiment was originally intended to investigate the limits of fitness gain during virus optimization in a defined environment, in this case BHK-21 cells in culture. The FMDV used was a biological clone obtained in BHK-21 cells; the virus had not adapted to the BHK-21 cell environment since it derived from a diseased swine during a disease outbreak. Upon extensive replication in BHK-21 cells, the virus evolved toward a bipartite genome (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004) thus adding reassortment to mutation and recombination as potential mechanisms of genetic variation of this laboratory-adapted picornavirus.",

Each segment in isolation could not infect cells productively, but, when present together, they were infectious by complementation, and killed cells in the absence of standard FMDV. Low multiplicity of infection rapidly selected the full length genome as a result of recombination of the two parental, defective segments (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004) . The particles containing the shortened RNA were thermically more stable than the standard particles (Ojosnegros et al., 2011) , but this difference did not explain the initial trigger of the segmentation event. The solution to this question came with the demonstration that the transition toward genome segmentation was possible because of an extensive exploration of sequence space by the standard virus. Indeed, the mutations accumulated during serial passages enhanced fitness of the segmented genome version to a much higher extent than fitness of the standard genome, thus conferring a selective advantage to the segmented form over its unsegmented (monopartite) counterpart (Moreno et al., 2014) (Figure 2.8) . Thus, in this segmentation event, gradual evolution (drift in sequence space) was a requirement for the major transition toward segmentation. This experimental result suggests that in evolution there is no unsurmountable barrier that allows the conversion between intact and split forms of the same genome, reflecting a remarkable genome flexibility that will be emphasized in Chapter 7 in the context of the relevance of virus variation in the emergence of viral pathogens.",

Mutation is a universal form of genetic change. It underlies numerous adaptive responses and critical biological transitions in viruses, and it is a prerequisite for recombination and reassortment to have a biological impact. If mutations were not present in different template molecules during replication, recombinants with the crossover point at equivalent positions of the parental genomes would be \"silent,\" and display the same behavior as the parental genomes. Apparently \"silent\" recombination events may take place within replicative units; even if some mutations distinguished individual genomes of the same quasispecies swarm, a recombinant would not be distinguished from a mutant genome. The frequency of recombination in HIV-1 was noticed only when the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic had advanced and the virus had diversified through accumulation of mutations. Similar arguments apply to segment reassortment.",

            "text": "Some defective DNA and RNA genomes that include indels, notably DI RNAs, originate by recombination. DI RNAs can play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections in cell culture, and can modulate viral infections in vivo (Holland and Villarreal, 1974; Roux et al., 1991) . Detailed genetic and biochemical analyses by A. Huang, J.J. Holland and their colleagues on the generation of VSV DI's and their interplay with the standard, infectious VSV contributed to unveil a continuous dynamics of genetic variation, competition, and selection, observable within short time intervals, a hallmark of RNA genetics (Palma and Huang, 1974; Holland et al., 1982) . Despite the continuous dynamics of escape of infectious virus to the interfering activities of DIs, some authors consider DIs as potential antiviral agents (Dimmock and Easton, 2014) . DI RNAs can be regarded as the tip of the iceberg of many classes of defective genomes with a range of interfering or potentiating capacities that may coexist with standard animal, plant, insect, and bacterial viruses, and that may facilitate persistence and modulate disease symptoms (Holland et al., 1982; Vogt and Jackson, 1999; L\u00f3pez-Ferber et al., 2003; Rosario et al., 2005; Sachs and Bull, 2005; Villarreal, 2005; Aaskov et al., 2006) . Noncytopathic coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) variants with deletions at the untranslated 5\u2032-genomic region were isolated from hearts of mice inoculated with CVB3. The variants replicated in vivo and were associated with long-term viral persistence (Kim et al., 2005) .",

Subsequent levels of selection occur when variant forms expand in multiple rounds of infection first within cells, then within an organism and then at the epidemiological level.

The same forces that drive general evolution have produced the dominant virus forms we see in nature, with all their nuances in the interaction with cell components. The adaptation of viruses to participate in intracellular processes with cells dictates that genetic variation of viruses has its limits to prevent deleteriousness.

Mutations are due mainly to changes in the electronic distributions of the standard nucleotides, to damage of nucleotides by external influences, and by alignment alterations of template relative to product polynucleotide chains. The effect of a mutation can range from being well tolerated to highly detrimental or lethal. \u2022 Mutation frequencies are only an indirect consequence of mutation rates. Their values for viruses whose replication is catalyzed by polymerases devoid of proofreading-repair activity are 10 5 to 10 6 -fold higher than those displayed by replicative cellular DNA polymerases. Error-prone replication is a hallmark of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses. The larger the amount of genetic information encoded in a viral genome, the lower the mutation rate must be to maintain the genetic message. \u2022 Several mechanisms of genetic recombination have been described for DNA and RNA viruses. The best characterized is homologous recombination whose frequency of occurrence is dependent on the replicative machinery, in particular polymerase processivity. Genome segment reassortment is operative in segmented genomes and it gives rise to biologically relevant changes such as antigenic shift in the influenza type A viruses. \u2022 Studies with foot-and-mouth disease virus have shown that extensive evolution of an unsegmented RNA genome has the potential to undergo a recombination-mediated transition akin to genome segmentation. Therefore, segmented and unsegmented forms of RNA viruses need not be considered as completely unrelated classes of genome organization. \u2022 Recombination and genome segment reassortment have been viewed as conservative forces to rescue viable genomes from a damaged pool, and also as means to explore new genomic compositions that deviate from their parents. All forms of genetic variation give rise to repertoires of variant genomes on which selection and random drift act to produce the viral forms that we isolate and study.",
