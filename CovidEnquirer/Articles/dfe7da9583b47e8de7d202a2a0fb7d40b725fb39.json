The feeding regimen was colostrum once daily, day 4 to 14; milk replacer once daily, day 15 to 28; and calf starter ad libitum, day 4 to 84. Bull calves were fed for 42 days and heifers for 84 days. Calves fed acidified colostrum refused more feed and were less efficient from day 4 to 14 than calves fed buffered colostrum. Bulls were more sensitive to acidified colostrum than heifers. Starter intake, total dry matter intake, and average daily gains were similar for all calves during days 4 to 84. Rumen fluid from calves fed diets with sodium bicarbonate was higher in acetate and lower in propionate and lactate than that from calves fed diets without sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate improved intake of acidified colostrum during the first 2 or 3 days of feeding but had no other effect on gain or feed intake.",

Otterby et al. (10) reported decreased acceptability of diet and depressed weight gain in calves fed colostrum acidified to pH 3.9, but responses improved when pH of colostrum was increased with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCOa). Foley et al. (7) observed that serum gammaglobulin and IgG concentrations of neonatal calves fed buffered colostrum were higher than those of calves fed fermented colostrum. In addition, Bullen et al. (3) reported that bovine colostrum with NaHCO3 had increased bacteriostatic activity. Kellaway et al. (8) and Emerick (5) reported NaHCO3 may improve performance of calves fed high concentrate diets pre-and postweaning. In contrast, Wheeler et al. (12) observed no improvement in feed intake, weight gain, rumen fluid pH, or fecal starch of calves fed pelleted diets containing 35% forage and NaHCO3 compared to calves fed rations without NaHCO3. However, feed efficiency was reduced, ratio of acetate-propionate increased, water intake increased, and more free-gas bloat occurred in animals fed NaHCO3.",

Calf starter (2% NaHCO3 was included in starters of calves fed diets 2 and 4) was available ad libitum from day 4 throughout the experimental period. Prior to feeding, colostrum was thawed and mixed with warm water so that total liquid offered was 8.5% of day-4 body weight whereas actual colostrum offered was 6% of body weight. Liquid feeds were offered at 1500 h. From day 15 to 28 milk replacer was fed to maintain a solids intake equal to that offered during colostrum feeding. The milk replacer was a commercial product containing 20% or more protein from milk sources. Sodium bicarbonate was added at .6% wt/wt to reconstituted replacer for calves fed diets 2 and 4. Calves were weaned at day 28. Water was available free-choice throughout the trial. Bulls were fed for 42 days and then sold, but heifers were fed for 84 days. The calf starter contained 41.7% shelled corn, 22.9% oats, 20.9% soybean meal, 8.3% wheat bran, 4.2% dried molasses, .8% trace mineral salt, .4% ground limestone, .4% dicalcium phosphate, and .4% vitamin premix.

Bulls fed diet 3 refused 7.4 kg colostrum/calf compared to 2.6 kg/calf refused by bulls fed diet 4. Bulls also tended to have higher and more variable refusals and were more sensitive to acid than heifers (Table 4 ). We were unable to find other research reporting these differences. Almost all colostrum refusals occurred during the first 2 to 3 days of feeding. After 3 days, refusals essentially were zero unless the calf was ill. This confirms (10) indicating improved acceptability of extremely acid colostrum (ca. pH 4.0). As expected, DM intakes from liquids (Table 5 ) during day 4 to 14 were less (P<.05) for calves fed diet 3 than for calves fed diets 1, 2, or 4. Calves consumed all milk replacer offered unless they were ill. Thus, differences in DM intake from liquids during day 15 to 28 reflect differences in feed allocation. Table 5 shows that differences in DM intakes from liquids were compensated partially by starter DM consumption during day 4 to 14 and 15 to 28 of the feeding periods.",

Four-to 14-day-old calves fed diet 2 gained .29 kg/day and did not differ from gains (.11 kg/day) of calves fed diets 3 and 4 ( Table  4 ). Average daily gains (ADG) were similar among treatments during all feeding periods. Wheeler et al. (12) also found no differences in ADG when calves were fed rations with or without NaHCO3, but others (5, 8) have observed differences. Table 4 shows bulls fed diet 3 from day 4 to 14 did not gain because of lower feed intake, a consequence of decreased acceptability of the acidified colostrum. Heifers gained more than bulls during this period. Heifers fed diet 2 gained more (P<.05) per day aDiets consisted of colostrum and starter (4 to 14 days), milk replacer and starter (15 to 28 days), and starter only (29 to 84 days). bDiet 1 = control; 2 = .6% NaHCO~ in colostrum, 2% NaHCO 3 in starter; 3 = acidified colostrum; 4 = acidified colostrum with NaHCO 3 added (.6% wt/wt), 2% NaHCO 3 in starter. cSE for n = 13.

            "text": "From day 4 to 14, calves fed diet 2 were more than three times as efficient (Table 6 ) as calves fed diet 3 (.52 kg gain/kg feed vs..16 kg/kg). However, 15-to 28-day-old calves fed diet 2 were the least efficient (.39 kg gain/kg feed), whereas calves fed diet 4 were the most efficient (.59 kg gain/kg feed). There was no breed effect. Intakes and gains fluctuated from day 4 to 28 and may have caused inconsistent feed efficiencies. Differences in feed efficiencies early in life probably mean little because ADG and feed efficiencies from day 29 to 84 were similar for all treatments. Table 7 shows that rumen fluid from 84-dayold heifers fed NaHCO3 (diets 2 and 4) was higher (P<.05) in molar percent acetate and lower (P<.05) in molar percent propionate than rumen fluid from heifers fed diets 1 and 3. Contents for butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, isovalerate, and total VFA were similar for all calves. Other researchers (2, 9, 12) reported similar changes in VFA profile when buffers were added to high concentrate rations. The lactic acid concentration of rumen fluid from heifers fed diets without NaHCO3 (.20/~moles/ ml) was higher (P<.07) than heifers fed diets containing NaHCO3 (.09 /zmoles/ml) and possibly related to concurrent changes in amount of propionate ( Table 7 ). The average pH of rumen fluid from heifers fed diets without NaHCO3 (6.43) and diets with NaHCO3 (6.50) did not differ. Two percent sodium bicarbonate in the starter did not elevate rumen pH as in (2) . Differences in ration composition and maturity of calves probably accounted for the varied results between studies. Considering that NaHCO3 did not affect rumen fluid pH, feed intakes, or health from day 29 to 84, it is not surprising that calf performance was similar for all treatments ( Table 4 ).",
