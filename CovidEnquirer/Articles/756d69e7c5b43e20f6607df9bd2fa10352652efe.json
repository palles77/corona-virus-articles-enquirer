The human-animal-ecosystem interface discussions can have the highest impact on improving and achieving our ''Millennium Development Goals'' and ''Health for All Mission''. The interconnectedness of human and animal pathogens, the emergence of influenza viruses, foodborne diseases, zoonotic diseases (rabies, brucellosis), environmental changes and cholera and emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance related to animal and poultry farming practices are all too well documented. Emerging and re-emerging diseases such as hantavirus, Lyme disease, leptospirosis, SARS and MERS-COV are clear examples. Investigating foodborne diseases require collaboration of agriculturists, food-processing industry, consumers and public health regulatory bodies. More than 250 microbial agents are today related to the cause of food-borne diseases.",

Strong clinical suspicion and a good laboratory support are essential for early diagnosis and treatment. 2 Gonorrhoea is a global public health problem with more than 100 million annual cases. 1 Gonococci have acquired resistance to various antibiotics over the time. Extended spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) are the drugs of choice these days. However, decreased susceptibility and even therapeutic failures to ESCs have been reported in many countries. Gonococci have TEM-1 b-lactamases which may mutate to develop even ESBL and thus complete resistance to cephalosporins. The current CDC guidelines recommend Cefriaxone 250 mg plus azithromycin 1 g orally. Azithromycin also provides cover for Chlamydia trachomatis. However, emergence of resistance to azithromycin is also reported in various countries. USA reported it in 0.5%, 0.3% and 0.4% in 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively. United Kingdom reported it in 0.8% in 2012 and 1.6% in 2013. Australia reported it in 2.1% in 2013. Canada reported it in 3.3% in 2016. 2 There is thus a need for monitoring the resistance in India regularly and research into alternate combination therapies. ",

Its role in countries with limited resources for early diagnosis, evaluation of quality of specimens and antimicrobial stewardship program is useful and critical. However, the quality of reporting of this procedure is poorly standardised. Poor specimen quality, limited skills of technologists in preparation of smears and interpretation of microscopic findings are sources of errors. This has been a matter of concern.

In a study of 205 patients suffering from cold, influenza or respiratory syncitial viral infection, 161 genes overexpressed while 235 genes were identified to express specifically in influenza and well before the symptoms appeared. The host gene expression once refined in due course of time, may be able to differentiate viral from bacterial infections and may become a part of antimicrobial stewardship program. 1 Tuberculosis kills 1.5 million persons per year in the world. Rapid and accurate diagnosis still remains a challenge. The detection of Mycobacteria (by microscopy, culture, molecular, assays) and host immune response (tuberculin skin test and IGRAs) have been the current approaches in clinical practice. A study of 2572 samples from pediatric and adult patients from 10 countries has shown three genes: GBP5, DUSP3 and KLF2 to be highly diagnostic of active tuberculosis. Their expression declines with treatment. Also bacterial drug resistance, prior BCG vaccination or HIV status has no influence on the expression of these three genes. 2 Thus host gene expression in infectious diseases may be the future diagnostic tool.",
