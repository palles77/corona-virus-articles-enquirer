The 3D8 single chain variable fragment (scFv) protein is a recombinant antibody with nuclease activity that shows antiviral effects against various DNA and RNA viruses in mice and chickens. In this experiment, 3D8 scFv G 2 transgenic chickens produced by crossing 3D8 scFv G 1 transgenic rooster and wild type hens were screened by genomic PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens, wild type sibling chickens, and SPF chickens were directly infected with IBV (5 chickens per group) and indirectly infected by airborne propagation (15 chickens per group). The relative IBV shedding titers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs on days 3 and 5 after intraocular infection. The viral load was significantly decreased in the 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens from the contact transmission group. Additionally, blood was collected from each group on day 17 post-infection. The ELISA results showed a marked reduction of the antibody titer against IBV in the 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens from the contact transmission group. These results suggest that the 3D8 scFv protein potentially inhibits infectious bronchitis virus transmission in chickens.",

The genome of IBV is an enveloped virus encoding four major structural proteins: the spike protein (S), which forms the prominent coronavirus spikes, the membrane protein (M), which is the most abundant component of the coronavirus, the envelope protein (E), which is a minor but critical component in virion assembly (De Haan et al., 1998) , and the nucleocapsid protein (N), which binds to the viral RNA with high affinity (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006; Liu et al., 2006) . IBV causes economically important upper respiratory and urogenital tract diseases in chickens, resulting in tracheal rales, sneezing, coughing, reduced weight gain, and reduction of egg production (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997) IBV is classified as a member of the family Coronaviridae and is found worldwide (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . In addition, although the use of vaccines has reduced large-scale IBV outbreaks, the vaccine alone is not sufficient to inhibit IBV (Jackwood et al., 2005) . Therefore, antiviral drug studies of IBV have been conducted using various extracts and proteins. Huawei showed that forsythoside A is an antiviral agent that protects primary chicken embryo kidney cells against IBV (Li et al., 2011) . Zhang et al. (2017) demonstrated that chicken mannose binding lectin (cMBL) plays a role in immunity, induces viral aggregation, and reduces IBV infection (Zhang et al., 2017) . Another study reported using swine intestine antimicrobial peptides (SIAMP) in chick embryos; with inhibition of viral replication and decreases in the pathological changes induced by IBV (Sun et al., 2010) .",

Moreover, cytosolically localized 3D8 scFv triggered apoptotic cell death via its nuclease activity (Jang et al., 2009) . In other words, a high 3D8 scFv protein expression level cannot be expected in chickens. If 3D8 scFv tg chickens are challenged with a viral titer exceeding the critical point at which an antiviral effect occurs, antiviral effects against the virus will not be observed in the tg chickens. However, in the case of the contact transmission group, the amount of virus derived from the directly infected chickens will represent the exposure, and the exposure dose might be lower than that inoculated into directly-infected chickens.

Also, it is infected in the respiratory tract, gut, kidney, and reproductive system of chicken which ultimately affects meat and egg production (Awad et al., 2014) . A number of antiviral studies have been conducted against IBV in response to these problems (Harrison et al., 2007; Jackwood et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2014; Shojai et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) . In the present study, we investigated resistance against IBV in chickens using 3D8 scFv. The 3D8 scFv tg chickens exhibited a reduction in shedding based on quantitation of viral RNA in the oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and reduced antibody titers against IBV. Many studies have confirmed the antiviral effects based on the nuclease activity of 3D8 scFv in rats, humans, and chickens (Jun et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015; Byun et al., 2017) . The nuclease activity of 3D8 scFv may be used as an antiviral agent for most viruses that have DNA or RNA as their genetic material. The development of a broad range of therapeutic agents for viruses with various mutations is very urgent and necessary. Ensuing studies will examine whether 3D8 scFv is effective against a variety of chicken viruses.",
