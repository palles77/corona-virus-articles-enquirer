However, the pathophysiology of this association remains uncertain. It is not known whether hyperglycemia changes the virulence of the infection, or if the virus modifies the glycemic metabolism. What we know is that diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection, and this can impact on glucose metabolism (4). DM is not just a disorder of glucose metabolism, but a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by multiple changes in lipid, carbohydrate and protein profiles (5) . Such inflammatory processes are due to hyperglycemia which leads to increased synthesis of glycosylation end products (AGEs), activates macrophages and other cells of the immune system, increase oxidative stress and promote the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, besides stimulating the synthesis of adhesion molecules that facilitate inflammation in the tissues (5). The inflammatory process and its complications might provide a higher propensity to infections or a greater severity of these conditions. Another important issue is how this inflammatory and immune response occur in diabetic patients who acquire a viral infection, as well as whether the virus itself interferes with insulin secretion or the glycemic control.",
