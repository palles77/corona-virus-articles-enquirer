            "text": "he recent outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have heightened concerns among public health experts around the world about the next influenza pandemic and the ability of health care services to respond effectively to such an overwhelming crisis. These experts include the World Health Organization, which cites the emergence of the H5N1 virus as a clear warning that we need to enhance preparedness for an influenza pandemic. 1 In light of these warnings, federal, provincial, territorial and local governments across Canada have been engaged in pandemic preparedness activities -activities that have also been driven by the country's recent experience with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. Canada was one of the first jurisdictions to release a modern, comprehensive strategy to deal with an influenza pandemic. The A key priority of pandemic preparedness at both the federal and provincial levels is planning for the surge capacity that will be required across the health care system to assess and treat individuals who are ill with influenza. In Ontario, it is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people will be ill enough with influenza to require an outpatient visit during an influenza pandemic 2 (these numbers are replicable for all provinces and territories). Guidelines on strategies to curtail or eliminate non-critical services across the health care system and for a competency-based approach to health human resources planning have been developed in Ontario to mitigate this surge in demand; however, these strategies alone will be insufficient. The anticipated surge would still overwhelm current resources and the ability of the health care system to maintain life-saving services would be severely compromised. 3 As a result, the 2006 version of the OHPIP includes a strategy for a community-based approach to influenza assessment and treatment as a means to further mitigate the impacts of the predicted surge and to help ensure that critical health services continue during an influenza pandemic.

            "text": "The Ontario community health care sector is diverse in terms of its focus, sophistication, professionalization, organization, dependencies and resources. Consequently, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) applied a network approach to foster collaboration across the community health care system to encourage an integrated approach to the delivery of community health services during a pandemic. The decision to use the network approach was based on evidence that suggests that allowing for a network of relations in emergency management can significantly improve the emergency management effort. A study of 164 emergency preparedness and response organizations by the University of Colorado (1993) found that: (i) the more contacts and the more cohesion, the greater the emergency preparedness; and (ii) the higher the hierarchical autonomy, the lower the preparedness. 4 The network tasked with developing the strategy for Ontario was struck by the MOHLTC and comprised a collection of provincial associations from the community health sector, including community health centres, public health, family physicians, long-term care, home and community care and not-for-profit emergency management organizations. Through a series of collaborative workshops, the network developed the overall strategy to divert all but the most severely ill from hospitals and to sustain individuals in their current environment. As well, the network identified which services and resources each of their members could potentially contribute to the overall strategy. As a result of this process, the network proposed that individuals who may be stricken with influenza-like illness during a pandemic be assessed and treated remotely and also through the implementation of alternate assessment, treatment and referral centres (Flu Centres). The overall objective of this approach is to provide a timely way for assessing and treating people with symptoms of influenza while allowing the critical aspects of the traditional health care system to continue (Figure 1 illustrates how patients will access the health care system during a pandemic). This approach, described in detail below, was adopted by the Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic Steering Committee and was included as a guideline in the 2006 version of the Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic.",
