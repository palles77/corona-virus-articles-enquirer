For example, herbivores need a fermentation chamber (either a rumen or an expanded cecum) for the digestion of cellulose, a feature not present in carnivores. Although a large variety of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances are clinically important in all species of animals, the predominant form of disease varies from species to species. Pet carnivores, partly because of their long life span, effective vaccines, and a lifestyle and diet similar to that of human beings, develop alimentary neoplasia far more often than herbivores. Meat-, milk-, and fiber-producing animals (ruminants and pigs) are host to a variety of infectious diseases that are largely resistant to vaccines. These pathogens may have evolved as a result of the herding instinct of these animals, giving the pathogens an opportunity to mutate within a large socially structured host population. Horses are most prone to displacements of alimentary viscera.",

Saliva lubricates the mouth and esophagus and moistens ingesta. Saliva also dissolves water-soluble components of food so the taste buds can function. The mucus in saliva binds to masticated food and creates a bolus that is more easily swallowed. Salivary mucus also coats the epithelium of the mouth, preventing mechanical damage to the tissue. Saliva, through its flushing action, reduces bacterial populations. Saliva contains a lysozyme that lyses bacteria. Carbohydrate digestion begins in the oral cavity as a result of the presence of \u03b1-amylase, which changes starch into maltose. There are very small quantities of this enzyme in carnivores and cattle. Saliva also is an effective buffer, especially in ruminants, whose forestomachs have no glands. In carnivores, evaporation of saliva is a major mechanism of thermoregulation.",

It is necessary for prehension, mastication, and swallowing of feedstuffs and water. The epithelial covering of the tongue is stratified squamous with various degrees of keratinization dorsally, but ventrally the epithelium is not keratinized and the tongue attaches to the floor of the oral cavity by a frenulum. Keratinized papillae are most prominent in ruminants and cats. There are various types of papillae, some with secondary lamellae. Vallate papillae, for example, are on the dorsal surface of the tongue near its origin and are flat structures completely surrounded by a cleft. Some surface macroscopic papillae contain taste buds. The tongue is a highly vascular (functioning in heat loss in many animals, especially carnivores that have no sweat glands) and sensitive organ containing a variety of serous and mucus glands and sensory cells (taste buds). The muscular part of the tongue is striated in randomly arranged bundles. A cordlike structure enclosed in dense collagen extending lengthwise near the ventral central surface of the tongue of carnivores is called the lyssa. Porcine and equine tongues have a similar structure. The lyssa appears to be a structure without a function. Historically the lyssa was removed as \"prevention\" for rabies. Lyssa bodies are synonymous with Negri bodies, and rabies used to be called lyssa. Adipose tissue becomes more abundant in the caudal part of the tongue in most species.",

The first two-thirds of C3 is fermentative with a pH of approximately 6.5. At the caudal flexure the mucosa thickens to 7 to 10 mm and the pH is around 2.0. The final portion surrounding the torus pyloricus has an alkaline pH.",

The overall Many nutrients are absorbed through the lateral intercellular spaces between cells. Enterocytes move up the crypt and intestinal villus to the extrusion zone at the villus tip, where effete enterocytes are discarded into the fecal mass by an apoptotic mechanism called anoikis. The turnover rate for enterocytes is the most rapid of any fixed-cell population in the body. In neonatal pigs, for example, the turnover rate is 7 to 10 days. In 3-week-old pigs that have achieved a mature or climax flora, that rate accelerates to 2 to 3 days. Enterocytes are pinocytotic in the neonate, which is important in colostrum uptake and transfer of passive immunity from the dam. Enterocytes contain class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and a complement of biotransformation enzymes important in metabolizing xenobiotics. Inflammatory bowel disease in human beings is accompanied by downregulation of genes encoding some of these enzymes, such as colonic enterocyte cytochrome P450. Enterocytic microvilli shed receptor-laden alkaline phosphatase and catalase-containing vesicles, thus potentially interacting with pathogens that are subsequently shed in the feces. This is one means of intestinal protection from pathogens. The microbiota/microbiome of the lower GI system consists of 100 trillion bacteria (10 times the number of cells in an animal) and 3.3 million genes (150 times the number of genes in an animal). These bacteria secrete bacteriocins (i.e., proteinaceous toxins that inhibit the growth of other bacteria) and compete for nutrients and for attachment sites, thus limiting potential pathogen growth. The microbiota promotes immune system maturation and contains biotransformation enzymes such as \u03b2-glucuronidases, \u03b2-glucosidases, mesenchymal cells of the lamina propria, and the muscularis mucosa. Damage to any of these structures or to their innervation can result in digestive dysfunction and resultant diarrhea.",

Notch and Wnt signals in combination are necessary for proliferation of enterocyte precursors, but differentiation of cell types is independent of Wnt. Wnt and notch synergy appears to induce intestinal adenomas. Notch pathways are used by cells (i.e., cell-cell communication) to regulate, via their genes, cell differentiation processes that occur during embryonic and adult life. In the gut, notch pathways influence whether intestinal epithelial stem cells differentiate into cells with secretory or absorptive functions. These pathways involve typical ligand-receptor interactions, in which the ligand is a transmembrane protein expressed in one cell type (see Chapter 1) that binds with a notch receptor (i.e., notch protein) present on or in the cell membrane of another cell type. This binding interaction results in modifications of gene expression in the cell expressing the receptor, such as facilitating its differentiation into an absorptive enterocyte. This ligand-receptor binding appears to result in cells organizing into groups of cell types as needed for their differentiation into specific tissues and organs.",

Generally this outcome is a problem of the small intestine, but secondary colonic malfunction can occur because of malabsorption of bile salts and fatty acids that stimulate fluid secretion in the large intestine. As examples, malabsorption occurs in rotavirus and coronavirus infections of neonates. \u2022 Chloride (Cl \u2212 ) hypersecretion by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) of a structurally intact mucosa. CFTR is regulated by kinases, which are dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which acts as a second messenger. Prostanoids, bacterial toxins, and protein kinases all increase cAMP, thus increasing Cl \u2212 secretion. Calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) also plays a role in opening Cl \u2212 channels by increasing acetylcholine interaction with epithelial muscarinic receptors via cholenergic nerves in intestinal plexi. Through a different mechanism but also involving the CFTR, bicarbonate secretion is also increased. This osmotic activity results in a net efflux of fluid and electrolytes independent of permeability changes, absorptive capacity, or exogenously generated concentration gradients (i.e., osmotic diarrhea). As examples, chloride hypersecretion occurs in enterotoxic E. coli diarrhea. \u2022 Exudation caused by an increased capillary permeability (proteinlosing enteropathy) by leaky tight junctions between enterocytes. As examples, exudation occurs in some parasitic infections in which opening of the tight junctions allows macromolecules (antibodies) into the intestinal lumen. \u2022 Hypermotility generally is involved in diarrhea but usually not as a primary mechanism in domestic animals. Hypermotility is defined as an increased rate, intensity, or frequency of peristalsis. Theoretically, with decreased mucosal contact time, digestion and absorption of nutrients and water should be less efficient. It is suspected that decreased motility in some diseases allows for increased bacterial proliferation . Conversely, some enterotoxins can stimulate intestinal motitlity in some motility disorders of human beings such as achalasia, Hirschsprung's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Diarrhea occurs when there is an alteration in the network of interstitial cells of Cajal within the smooth muscle of the bowel wall. Whether this is a cause or effect of bowel motility disorders is not known. \u2022 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and related molecules produced by enterocytes and leukocytes are very important in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and in the host's response to intestinal pathogens.

Pathogens causing diarrhea fall into three major categories: those that induce intestinal secretion, such as enterotoxic, or enterotoxigenic, Escherichia coli (ETEC) (noninflammatory or secretory diarrhea); those that induce inflammation, such as Lawsonia; and those that are invasive, such as Salmonella. To simplify this further, there are two mechanistic \"types\" of diarrhea, noninflammatory and inflammatory. Noninflammatory diarrheas are produced by organisms that disrupt the absorptive or secretory mechanisms of the enterocytes without destroying the cells. Usually, but not always, noninflammatory diarrheas affect the more proximal portions of the bowel (enterotoxic E. coli, rotavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum). Inflammatory diarrheas are produced by organisms that produce system functions. Acidosis is compounded by fecal bicarbonate loss in diarrhea and the results of inadequate renal excretion of hydrogen ions and inadequate absorption of bicarbonate, which is a late effect of inadequate renal perfusion. The resultant electrolyte imbalance results in an increase in intracellular hydrogen ion concentration and a decrease in intracellular potassium ion concentration. The imbalances decrease neuromuscular control of myocardial contraction, leading to a further decrease in tissue perfusion. A vicious cycle results, culminating in hypovolemic shock.",

The inciting cause is generally a diet very high in lipids and low in vitamin E or other tocopherols. Although steatitis of cats has historically been a sequela of fish-based diets, anecdotal evidence suggests that it may also be caused by some unconventional diets being used today. \u2022 Pancreatic or enzymatic fat necrosis is initiated by pancreatic enzyme release (lipase) from pancreatic necrosis (pancreatitis). Lipase converts triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol.

They release histamine, prostaglandins, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and proteolytic enzymes that play a role in diarrhea production. The nuts and bolts of the mechanisms listed are of course much more complicated. Pathogens enter or attach to enterocytes and may release enterotoxins. This action triggers the enterocytes to release cytokines (interleukin [IL]-8), which activate resident macrophages and recruit new blood-borne macrophages (e.g., monocytes) into the lamina propria. The activated macrophages release soluble factors (histamine, serotonin, adenosine) that increase intestinal secretion of chloride and water and inhibit absorption (Figs. 7-10 and 7-11). Recruitment of inflammatory cells to areas of injury results in release of a chemical milieu of cytokines . Other factors (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor) act on enteric nerves to induce neurotransmitter-mediated intestinal secretion and hypermotility. The subsequent cell damage is possibly a consequence of inflammation mediated by T lymphocytes or proteases and oxidants secreted by mast cells (see Fig. 7 -12).

Dehydration results in hypovolemia. Hypovolemia results in hemoconcentration that results in inadequate tissue perfusion. Energy therefore is generated in tissue by anaerobic glycolysis. The resultant hypoglycemia leads to ketoacidosis. Acidosis is, by definition, a reduction in blood and tissue pH. Acidosis causes a reduction in pH-dependent enzyme fatty acids combine with calcium, magnesium, and sodium ions, forming soaps resulting in chalky white deposits (see . This is a painful condition, and free lipid droplets are sometimes seen in fluids recovered from abdominocentesis. \u2022 Traumatic fat necrosis results from direct, usually blunt, trauma to adipose tissue and is a relatively uncommon occurrence.

Peritonitis is also called serositis, and when multiple serous membranes like those of the meninges, joints, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, and scrotum are affected, it is called a polyserositis.

Lethal glossopharyngeal defect, or bird tongue of dogs, is characterized by a pointed tongue that cannot wrap around a nipple and create the negative pressure required for nursing, and without intervention, starvation results. Ventral ankyloglossia, fusion of the tongue to the floor of the oral cavity, has been reported in related Anatolian shepherd dogs. The cause of these congenital lesions is not known, but they sometimes occur in association with other defects. As in the case of other congenital defects, ingestion of unknown teratogenic substances by the dam during gestation is an etiologic possibility, as is mutation of T-box genes. Disease agents that principally target the tongue are relatively rare. The exception to this rule is Actinobacillus lignieresii, a Gramnegative bacillus that is a normal inhabitant of the oral cavity. It is an opportunistic invader of damaged lingual tissue, principally in cattle and occasionally in horses and small ruminants. The granulomas resulting from infection contain centrally located actinobacilli rimmed by radiating amorphic, eosinophilic, and clublike structures composed of immunoglobulin molecules from lesion plasmacytes ( Fig. 7-51 ). Mixed mononuclear inflammatory cells, including multinucleated Langhans giant cells, often surround these foci (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon), and infection may drain and cause similar inflammation in submaxillary and retropharyngeal lymph nodes. The amount of fibrous tissue present depends on the duration of the inflammation and the swelling. Inflammation and fibrosis cause increased firmness and enlargement of the tongue called \"wooden tongue\" (Fig. 7-52 ).

In dogs, particularly in the large, deep-chested breeds, the acute gastric dilation and volvulus syndrome occurs. This lesion is life viruses, has been associated with squamous cell carcinomas in cattle. The clinical signs are similar to those of other causes of esophageal blockage and include dysphagia, regurgitation, weight loss, and dilation of the esophagus proximal to the mass. Tumors of the esophagus are occasionally palpable but are most often intraluminal rather than mural. Epithelial tumors include papillomas (Fig. 7-68) and The result of repeated episodes of gastric dilation is stretching and relaxation of the gastrohepatic ligament. Recurrent dilation, combined with overfeeding, postprandial exercise, and perhaps a hereditary predisposition, results in gastric rotation. Gastric rotation is recognized by splenic displacement and a twisted esophagus and results in vascular compression and decreased venous drainage and hypoxemia . The stomach generally is rotated clockwise on the ventrodorsal axis when the abdomen is viewed from the ventral surface. Rotation is 180 to 360 degrees. The combination of gastric hypoxemia, acid-base imbalance, obstruction of threatening and should not be confused with simple gastric dilation, which is common in young puppies after overeating. Predisposing factors to acute gastric dilation include a source of distending gas, fluid, or feed; obstruction of the cardia that prevents eructation and emesis; and obstruction of the pylorus that prevents passage of gastric contents into the small intestine. The source of gas is not well understood. Theories include gas production by C. perfringens, spores of which are present in the feed, carbon dioxide from physiologic mechanisms of digestion, or simple aerophagia. Chronic abomasal and/or ruminal dilation may occur in cows with overeating disease, dystocia, exhaustion, poor-quality or frozen feedstuffs, abomasal ulcers with or without abomasal lymphoma, and vagal indigestion.

Larvae of T. canis pass to nursing puppies through the milk, through fecal soiling of bedding, or from dirt or other fomites harboring eggs or larvae. After ingestion the parasite's larval sheath, feces, and saliva are antigenic. In dogs and cats, tissue reaction to these larvae in the mucosal and submucosal intestine and gastric epithelial cell is hyperplasia, resulting in a polyp-like proliferation of the antral mucosa. Pyloric obstruction sometimes results. \u2022 In other cases of eosinophilic gastritis the infiltration of eosinophils is more diffuse and is believed to be a hypersensitivity abomasal reflux. Scattered chromatolysis and neuronal necrosis in the celiac and mesenteric ganglia are consistent changes from a neurotoxicosis.

This form of eosinophilic gastritis may become transmural, with necrosis and scarring. \u2022 The third type, scirrhous eosinophilic gastritis of dogs and cats, for the most part has unknown causes. The fibrosis associated with scirrhous changes in the stomach and lymph nodes results in persistent emesis, weight loss, and malnutrition. The gross lesions of eosinophilic gastritis are rather nonspecific and consist of diffuse or nodular mural thickenings. Microscopic lesions are characterized by infiltrates of eosinophils in the mucosa and the submucosa and are seen extensively through the muscularis of the stomach. Similar lesions are sometimes present in segments of the small intestine and colon. In the dog there is sometimes necroproliferative eosinophilic perivasculitis and eosinophilic lymphadenopathy. In the scirrhous form the eosinophilic infiltrate is followed by transmural fibroplasia and scarring.",

The conditions necessary for ulcer development boil down to an imbalance between acid secretion and mucosal protection. This imbalance occurs as a result of the following: \u2022 Local disturbances or trauma to the mucosal epithelial barrier; this injury can be due to back flush of bile salts from the duodenum or ingestion of lipid solvents such as alcohol \u2022 Normal or high gastric acidity \u2022 Local disturbances in blood flow (stress-induced and sympathetic nervous system-mediated arteriovenous shunts) resulting in ischemia \u2022 Steroids and NSAIDs that depress prostaglandin formation (PGE 2 , PGI 1 ) or concentration, thus decreasing phospholipid secretions, which are protective All of these mechanisms allow pepsin and hydrochloric acid into the submucosa. Severe gastric hyperacidity and gastric ulcers are sometimes associated with the presence of islet cell tumors producing gastrin. Some of these gastrin-producing tumors arise in the duodenum, but the majority originate in the pancreas. These neoplasms release histamine into the bloodstream, which binds to receptors on parietal cells of the stomach, increasing HCl secretion. The gastric ulceration produced associated with these tumors is known as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.",

The causes of atresia in domestic animals are not completely understood, but they can be a result of mechanical lesions to fetal blood vessels in a portion of the gut, such as caused by malpositioning, that compromise circulation and results in vascular accidents and ischemia. Release of meconium into the abdominal cavity of the fetus may result in sterile peritonitis and may be responsible for some cases of atresia such as in cystic fibrosis of human beings. In still other cases the embryonic cells that normally occlude the lumen fail to break down, resulting in atresia.

For example, rectal stricture is a sequela of salmonellosis nonpigmented on the lateral neck and flank. The overo pattern typically includes at least one pigmented leg. Affected foals are white and appear normal at birth. They do not pass meconium; subsequently they develop colic and die usually by 72 hours after birth. These white foals are nonperistaltic because of absence of the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus or submucosal (Meissner's) plexus, particularly in the colon and rectum. Thus these anomalies can be termed aganglionosis. A congenital aganglionic megacolon is contracted and nonperistaltic. Dilation or megacolon occurs proximal to the aganglionic section of the gut. Acquired megacolon is secondary to damage to the colonic innervation. Such events are usually traumatic and most common in carnivores struck by automobiles.

Perineal hernias are seen in old male dogs with prostate gland enlargement and obstipation. Some of these herniations (diaphragmatic, perineal) are more correctly termed eventrations (protrusion of the intestine through the abdominal wall or diaphragm) because they are not accompanied by a peritoneal pouch. Postoperative wound resemble the folds of an accordion (see Fig. 7-101, B) . Red to black discoloration depends on the degree of vascular compromise, ranging from congestion to hemorrhage and necrosis. The mesenteric attachment of the intussusceptum may be seen extending from the lesion. This occurs as the vascular mesentery gets pulled into the intussuscipiens compressing first the thinner-walled veins and then the arteries. Fibrin exudation, ischemic necrosis, congestion, and edema may occur in both the intussusceptum and intussuscipiens. On rare occasions, antemortem intussusceptions spontaneously reduce by sloughing of the infarcted intussusceptum, which then passes in the feces. Often the site of sloughing is replaced with fibrous tissue, and a circumferential scar or stricture forms. Because peristalsis continues after death, intestinal invaginations can occur post mortem. Before attributing death to intestinal obstruction caused by intussusception, there is a need to determine if the intussusception took place before or after death. Because inflammation occurs only in the living organism, postmortem invaginations are easily reduced because there are no adhesions and they are not accompanied by hyperemia or fibrin on the peritoneal surfaces, which remain smooth and glistening.",

Interestingly, besides causing a malabsorptive diarrhea, rotaviruses produce a secretory enterotoxin nonstructural protein (NSP4) that increases chloride secretion through a calciumdependent mechanism. This toxin also activates the enteric nervous system and blocks the intestinal sodium/glucose cotransporter. All of these increase fluid and the rate of peristalsis in the intestinal lumen. Depending on the degree of enterocyte loss, recovery may be delayed or incomplete, depending on the amount of absorptive surface that is permanently lost. When death occurs, it is generally associated with intercurrent infections with those organisms that also target villous epithelial cells such as coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, coccidia, and others.",

Animals that die from enterotoxic E. coli infection are often emaciated and have diarrheic feces pasted around their perineum. Septicemic Colibacillosis. Septicemic or enteroinvasive colibacillosis (EIEC) is a disease of newborn calves, lambs, and occasionally foals that have not received sufficient colostrum to develop immunity. Although the lesions produced are generally those of septicemia, similar to those caused by other organisms, infection can localize in the intestine, causing enteritis. Diagnosis is generally made by finding fibrin in any location in the body such as the eye, joints, abdomen, heart sac, meninges, and/or thorax. The bacteria gain entry to the body through the respiratory system, oral cavity, or umbilicus. Fibrinous arthritis, ophthalmitis, serositis, meningitis (polyserositis), and white-spotted kidneys (cortical abscesses) characterize the septicemia (see Fig. 11 Enterohemorrhagic colibacillosis (EHEC) is described in human beings, laboratory animals, and occasionally cattle and pigs. It has not been reported as a field problem in livestock. The pathogenesis of the disease is similar to that of other invasive bacteria such as Salmonella spp. In human beings the colon is affected. A Shiga toxin gene, a locus for enterocyte effacement, and a plasmid encoding for hemolysin are produced by E. coli, which result in hemorrhagic colitis and sometimes the hemolytic uremic syndrome. These strains are also called verotoxic E. coli, which are strains based on the Vero (African green monkey kidney) cell line on which the bacteria are sometimes grown. Outbreaks of enteroinvasive colibacillosis in human beings are often food-borne illnesses. These organisms are pathogenic because of their acid resistance and ability to survive transport through the stomach. Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 rarely causes naturally occurring disease in domestic livestock but often contaminates ground beef. Surveys have indicated that the seroprevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in dairy herds is 38.5%, with an individual cow prevalence of 6.5%, and is most often isolated from the skin surface. This finding is an important reason not to eat undercooked ground beef.

Lesions are characterized by E. coli attachment to the microvillous border of enterocytes and gallbladder epithelium via cups and pedestals (E- Fig. 7-19) .

Although generally asymptomatic, diarrhea may result in very young animals or in animals otherwise immunologically deficient. Giardia spp. have been shown to induce apoptosis of enterocytes, thus increasing membrane permeability. In large numbers the parasites decrease the absorption of simple sugars and disaccharides secondary to microvillous destruction. Ingesta are then fermented by bacterial flora, creating gas and osmotically drawing water into the intestinal lumen. An enterotoxin stimulates intestinal Cl \u2212 secretion. Clinical cases of giardiasis have brown, fluid diarrhea and abdominal discomfort without fever, weight loss, melena, and/or steatorrhea. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating Giardia in preparations of fresh feces or in histologic sections by identifying the organisms either with H&E or Giemsa stains.",

They are 3 to 4 cm immunocompromised individuals, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients, suffer from intractable diarrhea. When treating calves, veterinarians and veterinary students are at particular risk for infection. Cryptosporidia attach to surface epithelial cells of the stomach, small intestine, or colon. The protozoa displace the microvilli and are enclosed by surface cell membranes. Thus the parasite lives in a unique environment described as intracellular but extracytoplasmic (E- Fig. 7-20) . Microgametes, macrogametes, schizonts, trophozoites, meronts, merozoites, and oocysts can be demonstrated in the intestine adjacent to, or attached to, epithelial cells. Oocysts are 4 to 5 \u00b5m in diameter and are shed in the feces. Studies have indicated that there are species-specific tropisms or biotypes of cryptosporidia. Previously, fecal contamination of water supplies by ruminants was believed to be the cause of most human outbreaks. Molecular typing of the organism has shown in many disease outbreaks that contamination with human feces and human-specific cryptosporidia causes most human epidemics.",

Adult worms may be vomited or passed in the diarrheic feces. A hacking cough termed thumping is a sign of pulmonary larva migrans, especially in pigs. Anthelmintic administration can cause a rapid die-off of adult ascarids, resulting in intestinal occlusion (see E- Fig. 7-13) .

Hookworm Disease. Parasitism by hookworms varies from asymptomatic to fatal based on the challenge dose of parasites, the host's age, nutritional status, and likely its immunologic state. When death occurs, it is by exsanguination because hookworms are blood eaters (Fig. 7-131) . Challenge dosage is often exacerbated by poor nutritional and sanitary conditions, mild climatic conditions, and moisture. Hookworms are generally small nematodes, 1 to 1.5 cm long. Their habitat is usually the proximal small intestine. Genera include Ancylostoma and Uncinaria in dogs, Bunostomum in ruminants, Globocephalus in pigs, and Ancylostoma and Necator in human beings.

Foot-and-mouth disease is an extremely important disease and disease threat of artiodactyls worldwide but has not appeared in U.S. livestock since 1929, when it was eradicated after an outbreak in California. Virus spreads rapidly and principally by aerosol. The disease is characterized in its early stages by vesicles in the planum nasale, in the oral cavity, and tongue. The picornavirus of foot-and-mouth disease attaches to susceptible cells via integrins on the cell surface. Fluid from ruptured vesicles spreads to areas of abraded skin, for example, skin of a mammary gland. When coronary bands and hooves are affected, coronary band vesiculation may eventually lead to sloughing of the hoof. Although this disease is not fatal, the pain and accompanying inappetence lead to weight loss. If allowed to heal, the hoof will regrow into a ball-like structure. Young animals with foot-and-mouth disease frequently have a viral myocarditis without other signs. Vaccination is shortlived (6 months) and takes time to become effective in individual animals; thus immediate protection is not provided. Persistent infections occur in water buffalo and infected cattle that have been previously vaccinated. Parapox Stomatitides. The two major diseases in this category, bovine papular stomatitis and contagious ecthyma, are zoonotic. Bovine papular stomatitis is recognized by papules on the nares, muzzle, gingiva, buccal cavity, palate, and tongue ( Fig. 7-148 ). Lesions also occur in the esophagus, rumen, and omasum. Microscopically, acantholysis is responsible for the macule and ballooning degeneration of these cells, which may contain intracytoplasmic eosinophilic parapoxvirus inclusions at a later stage (Fig. 7-149 ; also see Fig. 1-11) . Erosion of the infected cells accompanied by a neutrophilic infiltrate heals readily from the unaffected basal epithelium. The disease is more common in immunosuppressed animals such as those persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus. In human beings the disease is called milker's nodules and is characterized by papules of the hands and arms.",

Clinical signs include a distended left paralumbar fossa, a distended abdomen (see E- Fig. 1-8) , increased respiratory and heart rates, and late in the disease, decreased ruminal movements. When death occurs, it is attributable to distention of the abdomen, which compresses the diaphragm, moving it cranially (orad), with resultant decreased pleural cavity size and respiratory embarrassment.

Causes of vagal indigestion include damage to the vagus nerve due to traumatic reticuloperitonitis, liver abscesses with secondary peritonitis, volvulus of the abomasum, and bronchopneumonia. Mechanical obstruction of the forestomach or abomasal outflow can be due to abomasal lymphoma or papillomas or from blockage after ingestion of indigestible or foreign materials. Diet and dwarfism are sometimes associated with vagus indigestion. Many cases are idiopathic. Clinical signs include ruminoreticular distention. The presence of abomasal distention depends on the precise location of the damage to the vagus nerve. Vagal indigestion is divided into the following four types, based on the anatomic location of the functional obstruction. \u2022 Type I is usually caused by inflammatory lesions around the vagal nerve at any location and is a failure of eructation, resulting in bloat. \u2022 Type II is a functional or anatomic condition that results in failure of omasal transport into the abomasum. Usual causes are adhesions and abscesses on the medial wall of the reticulum associated with or secondary to traumatic reticuloperitonitis. Abomasal lymphoma and physical obstruction of the omasal canal (e.g., neoplasia or ingested placenta) may also be causative. \u2022 Type III is caused by physical impaction of the abomasum by roughage and thus is dietary in origin. Abomasal displacements and volvulus are also potential causes. \u2022 Type IV is pregnancy related, perhaps as a result of shifting of position of the abomasum secondary to the expanding uterus, causing compression of the abdominal branches of the vagus nerve.",

Left-sided displacement of the abomasum is a generally nonfatal entity seen in high-producing dairy cattle during the 6 weeks after parturition. Strenuous activity can predispose nonpregnant cows to displacement. In the postcalving period, abomasal atony can occur as a result of heavy grain feeding (volatile fatty acids decrease motility) and hypocalcemia. Meanwhile, the gravid uterus may have displaced the rumen and abomasum cranially and to the left, rupturing the attachment of the greater omentum to the abomasum. The abomasum then occupies the cranial left quadrant of the abdomen and displaces the rumen medially. This change leads to partial obstruction of abomasal outflow. Metabolic alkalosis contributes to rumen atony and impaired movement of ingesta. The associated hypochloremia is a result of HCl secretion and is common along with hypokalemia.

Exotic ruminants may also become infected. Under certain circumstances pigs may become subclinically infected. This is of interest because the viruses of bovine viral diarrhea and hog cholera are antigenically closely related. This may cause confusing serologic results when testing hogs for cholera. New World camelids may also succumb to bovine viral animals 8 months to 2 years of age. In this respect, clinical cases are typically younger than animals susceptible to Johne's disease. Animals, including New World camelids, infected in utero or early in life with noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea pestivirus develop a persistent infection as a result of immunotolerance. They shed virus throughout their lives. Later in life, if exposed to cytopathic pestivirus, they may develop disease.

Lawsonia enteritis manifests in a variety of ways, as indicated by the number of names applied to it: proliferative enteropathy, proliferative ileitis, intestinal adenomatosis, distal ileal hypertrophy, terminal ileitis, and proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy. The genus of the causative agent has undergone several recent changes in nomenclature. For many years this disease was believed to be caused by Campylobacter spp. (Campylobacter mucosalis, C. jejuni, Campylobacter hyointestinalis). Newer methods of bacterial classification caused the name to be changed to Ileobacter and now L. intracellularis, the only species in the genus. Pigs older than Hemolytic E. coli proliferates in the small intestine subsequent to dietary changes and produces a heat-labile exotoxin called the edema disease principle. This systemic toxin (angiotoxin) causes generalized vascular endothelial injury of arterioles and arteries (see Fig.  10 -69), resulting in fluid loss and edema. The edema can be found anywhere but is most characteristic in the gastric submucosa (see Fig. 10 -79), eyelids (Fig. 7-169) , forehead, gallbladder, and mesentery of the spiral colon ( Fig. 7-170) . In the brain, arterial damage causes focal malacia in the medulla, thalamus, and basal ganglia. These nervous tissue lesions are collectively known as focal symmetric encephalomalacia or swine cerebral angiopathy and are responsible for the variety of clinical signs.

The disease appears identical to enterotoxic colibacillosis of the neonate in that it produces a secretory diarrhea and therefore no lesions in 4 weeks of age are susceptible; thus this condition is a postweaning disease. Disease is believed to be caused by an unknown interaction of Lawsonia with normal gut flora. The nature of the lesions is a function of the extent of intestinal mucosal necrosis. The disease begins as a bacteria-induced stimulation of small intestinal crypt epithelial cells, particularly in the ileum (Figs. 7-173 and 7-174) , where lesions are generally most severe. With time the lesions progress to necrosis of the proliferating crypt cells with hemorrhage ( Fig.  7-175) . Thus the morphologic appearance of the lesions varies from case to case. The mechanism of lesion production is not well understood. Infection results in immunosuppression with a reduction in CD8 + T and B lymphocytes. In the proliferative form of the disease, the causative bacteria may be seen in apical cytoplasm of enterocytes. The mechanism of enterocyte proliferation may relate to Lawsonia-induced altered transcription of host \"alarm response\" genes that affect regulation of the cell cycle and cell differentiation. The enterocyte hyperplasia that results may cause release of cytokines that attract macrophages. With severe disease, bacteria are present in macrophages in the lamina propria. This may cause release of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), resulting in vascular permeability and hemorrhage.

Severe lesions consist of partially denuded villi over debris-filled crypts, some of which lack an epithelial lining. Because the villous basement membrane is exposed during the continuing extrusion process, villous fusion occurs, resulting in lack of a scaffold for enterocyte replacement once the crypts recover.

Although it affects cats of all ages, the disease is principally found in the young and old. Twelve percent of feline deaths are associated with feline infectious peritonitis. The cause of the disease is a coronavirus related to the coronavirus of transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs. The coronavirus of feline infectious peritonitis in cats is believed to be a mutated enteric coronavirus. After entry into the body, the first round of viral replication takes place in the lymphoid system. Macrophages are infected and carry the virus systemically. Endothelial cells are activated secondary to upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II. Observations suggest that activated monocytes are critical for development of vasculitis. Lesions are multifocal, and most organs, including the CNS, may be affected (see Figs. 14-105 and 14-106). The lesions in the vasculature of the eye are sometimes useful in making a",

Complement is fixed, and inflammatory cell chemoattractants are produced. Vasculitis results in protein effusion. Thus lesions are vasocentric. The prodromal course of feline infectious peritonitis is shortened, and the development and extent of lesions are accelerated in seropositive cats. Feline infectious peritonitis is usually characterized by progressive wasting because of protein loss. It is unusual for a virus to result in pyogranulomatous lesions, but in feline infectious peritonitis the vasocentric deposition of immune complexes results in pyogranulomas. These lesions are single to multiple, white, and raised. On the surface of the kidney they often are linear, clearly following the renal surface vasculature (see Fig. 11 -68). In its \"wet form,\" feline infectious peritonitis is characterized by variable of amounts of thick, stringy, high-protein effusion in body cavities. When placed between gloved fingers, this transudate may be drawn out in strings as the fingers are separated. The transudate is sterile, eliminating most other causes of fibrinous peritonitis.
