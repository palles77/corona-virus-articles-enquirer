This impression may be incorrect, because not all cats experimentally exposed to FIPV develop FIP. There is also a belief that the incidence of FIP may be affected by a number of host, virus, and environmental cofactors. However, the contribution of these cofactors to immunity and disease incidence has not been determined. The present study followed 111 random-bred specific pathogen free (SPF) cats that were obtained from a single research breeding colony and experimentally infected with FIPV. The cats were from several studies conducted over the past 5 years, and as a result, some of them had prior exposure to feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) or avirulent FIPVs. The cats were housed under optimized conditions of nutrition, husbandry, and quarantine to eliminate most of the cofactors implicated in FIPV infection outcome and were uniformly challenge exposed to the same field strain of serotype 1 FIPV. Forty of the 111 (36%) cats survived their initial challenge exposure to a Type I cat-passaged field strains of FIPV. Six of these 40 survivors succumbed to FIP to a second or third challenge exposure, suggesting that immunity was not always sustained. Exposure to non-FIP-inducing feline coronaviruses prior to challenge with virulent FIPV did not significantly affect FIP incidence but did accelerate the disease course in some cats. There were no significant differences in FIP incidence between males and females, but resistance increased significantly between 6 months and 1 or more years of age. Genetic testing was done on 107 of the 111 infected cats. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) segregated the 107 cats into three distinct families based primarily on a common sire(s), and resistant and susceptible cats were equally distributed within each family. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 73 cats that died of FIP after one or more exposures (cases) and 34 cats that survived (controls) demonstrated four significant associations after 100k permutations. When these same cats were analyzed using a sib-pair transmission test, three of the four associations were confirmed although not with genome-wide significance. GWAS was then done on three different age groups of cases to take into account age-related resistance, and different associations were observed.",

            "text": "The prevalence and severity of infectious diseases among multi-cat populations is a product of many diverse factors that affect the host/pathogen interaction (Pedersen, 1991) . Environmental factors include things such as population density, sanitation, and interchange of animals while agent factors include virulence, dose, and route of exposure. Host factors include developmental and heritable anomalies in the immune system and age at the time of exposure and intercurrent illnesses. Many of these diverse cofactors have been implicated in FIP. Foley et al. (1997) studied a number of environmental risk factors for FIP in seven catteries and found that cat numbers (density) and husbandry procedures had no influence on FIP incidence while age, high coronavirus antibody titers, and the proportion of cats shedding coronavirus were significantly associated with FIP risk. All of these risk factors are interrelated, because fecal coronavirus shedders are much more likely to have antibody titers >1:100 and younger cats are more likely to shed FECV at higher levels and for longer periods (Pedersen et al., , 2008 . The stresses of placing young cats into shelters have also been shown to greatly increase the levels of FECV shedding .",

The dose of virus used also can alter disease outcome although a dose that causes lethal infection in one cat may be insufficient to infect another (Pedersen and Black, 1983) . Virulence may be influenced by the exact FIP-inducing mutations that are present. The known FIPassociated mutations in FECV 3c and the S1/S2 cleavage site are highly variable and unique to each isolate while the two single nucleotide mutations in the fusion domain are common to all FIPVs (Pedersen, 2014) . Mutations in 7b can also alter virulence in some tissue culture-adapted strains, but do not play a role in the FECV-to-FIPV mutations in nature (Pedersen, 2014) . Additional mutations may await discovery and their singular or collective roles in FIP remain to be determined.",

Kittens are born with immature immune systems, and the period between 4 and 16 weeks of age is when IgG and IgA systems are being compensated by passive local and systemic immunity (Pedersen, 1987a) . Immaturity of the immune system may also play a role in the ability to vaccinate kittens to FIP; a commercially marketed attenuated live FIPV vaccine only demonstrated sufficient efficacy for licensing when given to kittens 16 weeks or older (Gerber et al., 1990) . Field and laboratory studies indicate that some sort of maternal or innate resistance to FECV infection is present in neonatal kittens and that FECV fecal shedding usually does not occur until 9 weeks of age, even among kittens born to infected queens (Pedersen et al., 2008) . Most cases of FIP occur in cats between 4 and 18 months of age (reviewed Pedersen, 2009 ) suggesting that some infections may remain subclinical for an extended period of time.",

FIP did not exist before the 1950s (Holzworth, 1963) , suggesting that cats may not have had time to genetically adapt, thus explaining why morbidity and mortality are so high in experimental FIPV infections. Pedigreed cats are more likely to develop FIP than random-bred cats (Robison et al., 1971; Rohrbach et al., 2001; Pesteanu-Somogyi et al., 2006; Worthing et al., 2012) , and certain breeds are also more likely to succumb to FIP (Bell et al., 2006; Norris et al., 2005; Pesteanu-Somogyi et al., 2006; Worthing et al., 2012) . One study of Persian catteries and pedigrees indicated that susceptibility to FIP was at least 50% heritable . Resistance to FIP in Birman cats also appears to have a genetic component as determined by GWAS (Golovko et al., 2013) . Natural resistance to FIP has also been observed in up to one-third of random-bred cats used as controls in vaccine studies (Baldwin and Scott, 1997; Gerber et al., 1990; Glansbeek et al., 2002; Hohdatsu et al., 2003; Kiss et al., 2004; Pedersen and Black, 1983; Wasmoen et al., 1995) .",

Forty of the 111 cats resisted a single challenge exposure and 34 remained resistant after repeated infections. The studies were unique in that all of the cats were housed in identical facilities, cared for in an identical manner, and maintained free from other feline pathogens. Therefore, they were not affected by many of the agents, environmental, and host factors that might affect the incidence of FIP in nature. This allowed for an uncomplicated assessment of risk factors such as age, gender, and genetic susceptibility on disease outcome.",

This was accomplished by negating as many potential cofactors as possible using a standardized virus challenge, cats from the breeding facility, optimal husbandry, providing a uniform environment and diet, minimizing extraneous stresses, and eliminating the effects of other common infections that might occur in multi-cat environments such as catteries or shelters. After minimizing the agent, environmental, and host cofactors, the opportunity existed to study host-related factors such as genetics, age, and gender on FIP resistance. The present study also dealt with the strength of immunity, which does not appear to be absolute. About 10% of cats that survived one FIPV infection succumbed to a second or third exposure. A similar occurrence was observed by Wasmoen et al. (1995) ; one of five cats that had successfully resisted a challenge exposure that killed 4 of 5 non-vaccinates developed FIP upon a second exposure. This type of immunity is different from that established by feline panleukopenia, a parvovirus disease. Panleukopenia immunity is usually solid and is more dependent on humoral than cellular responses (Scott, 1987) . Therefore, FIPV immunity more closely resembles immunity to its parent virus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV-infected cats shed virus in their feces for weeks or months before sufficient immunity develops to stop shedding, but after shedding ceases, antibody levels fall and many of the cats become susceptible to reinfection (Pedersen et al., 2008) . Subclinical disease is also known to linger after initial natural and experimental infection in some cats as demonstrated by FeLV activation (Pedersen, 1987b; Pedersen et al., 1977) .",

Previous experience with a large cohort of inbred Birman cats (Golovko et al., 2013) suggested that this approach could be applied to the present cohort of randomly bred cats. However, the same population substructure problems encountered in the Birman study were faced in this study. GWAS comparing all cases and controls demonstrated four significant genome-wide associations on several chromosomes and some possible candidate genes. However, there was considerable population substructure as revealed by MDS and attributed to separate male founder effects. Population substructure due to relatedness in a case-control study can be overcome by using different types of analysis, such as the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) or the sib-TDT that was employed in this study. A previous GWAS study localized the autosomal recessive locus associated with hypokalemia in cats by analyzing as few as 35 cases and 25 controls (Gandolfi et al., 2012) . However, the present study was conducted on random-bred cats, which are known to have less linkage disequilibrium than within pedigreed cats (Alhaddad et al., 2013) . The study was further confounded by the polygenic appearance of the inheritance. Inheritance to FIP resistance/susceptibility in a similarly sized cohort of Birman cats also appeared to be polygenic and there were no common regions of association, which would have reinforced both studies (Golovko et al., 2013) .",

SNPs on chromosomes A3, B1, and C1 were shared by the two different analyses while two new associations on chromosomes C2 and D3 appeared.

Unfortunately, the number of case and control cats challenge exposed after 1 year of age was too low, so cats exposed at >6 months and >1year were combined. The control population remained the same for all GWAS configurations based on the premise that kittens surviving exposure at less than 6 months of age would still resist exposure as they aged. As was expected based on previous GWAS configurations, relatively small changes in the case populations had a marked effect on observed associations. After comparing the results of GWAS based on age, GWAS of the total population, and GWAS based on family structure, only one peak of strong, but not genome-wide significant, associations were present on chromosomes A3 in a region between 34.8 and 46 Mb. Thirty five annotated genes were present within this region, but none appeared to be strong candidates for FIP resistance.",

            "text": "It can be concluded from these various GWAS studies that resistance to FIP in this population of relatively random-bred SPF cats was not influenced by a single or even small number of genes. As in an earlier study with a much more inbred Birman population (Golovko et al., 2013) , any genetic component of resistance is likely to be polygenic and divergent between various populations. Although mutations in a single gene have been identified that confer resistance to infectious disease, such as the CCR5 mutation for HIV infection (Dean et al., 1996) , susceptibility and resistances to infectious agents clearly involve complex host/virus/environment interactions that make genetic studies difficult. This has been shown in diseases such as human and ruminant tuberculosis (Chimusa et al., 2014; le Roex et al., 2013) , a disease that closely resembles the dry form of FIP. The existence of additional risk factors, involving the environment, host, and agent, is perhaps one of the most daunting problems in the search for genetic influences on infectious diseases. This study removed a large number of those confounding factors but was still unable to identify specific genes that might be involved in FIP resistance. Unfortunately, even highly inbred breeds, such as Birman, with significant linkage disequilibrium and closed colonies, such as the one in this study, suffer from high genomic inflations. Even so, the strong associations demonstrated in this relatively small GWAS employing a relatively low-density array indicate that FIP resistance is influenced in some part to genetic factors. The heritability of these genetic factors remains a subject of ongoing breeding studies.",

            "text": "The objective of this study was to define natural immunity to FIP among randomly bred specific pathogen-free cats bred for laboratory purposes under conditions that would eliminate as many extrinsic disease cofactors as possible. Cats were housed free of other feline pathogens and fed and cared for in a uniform manner. This emphasized the relative influence of age at the time of exposure, strength of immunity as gauged by repeated challenge exposure, and possible genetic resistance. One-third of random-bred laboratory cats used in various studies over the last decade appeared to be resistant to infection with Type I field strains of FIPV. However, immunity was not absolute and a small number of cats died after a second and even third challenge. Age at the time of exposure seemed to be the most significant predictor of resistance; cats under 6 months of age were most apt to develop FIP, cats 6-12 months were intermediate, and cats over 12 months of age demonstrated significant resistance. Strong genetic associations were identified by GWAS in regions of several chromosomes, especially when comparing all cats that died of FIP with all survivors. However, all but one of these regional associations changed when GWAS was adjusted for family substructure or age at the time of FIPV exposure. This confirmed previous GWAS studies on FIP resistance in Birman cats (Golovko et al., 2013) ; both studies showed inheritance of FIP resistance to be highly complex and confounded by considerable population stratification. Future breeding studies will hopefully confirm the heritability of FIP resistance.",
