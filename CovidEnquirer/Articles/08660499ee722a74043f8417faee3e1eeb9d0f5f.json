            "text": "The ongoing Zika epidemic in the Americas has challenged public health surveillance, response, and control systems. Even as the epidemic appears to be near its end in the Americas, it is unclear whether substantial Zika virus transmission may still be ongoing. This issue is exacerbated by large discrepancies in local case reporting and significant delays in detecting outbreaks due to surveillance gaps. To uncover locations with lingering outbreaks in the Americas, we investigated travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in the United States and Europe to identify signatures of transmission dynamics that were not captured by local reporting. We found that a large and unreported Zika outbreak occurred in Cuba during 2017, a year after peak transmission in neighboring countries, with cases still appearing in 2018. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we show that the 2017 outbreak in Cuba was sparked by longlived lineages of Zika virus introduced from multiple places in the Americas a year prior. Our data suggest that while aggressive mosquito control in Cuba may initially have been effective at mitigating Zika virus transmission, in the absence of vaccines, herd immunity, or strong international coordination, such control measures may need to be maintained to be effective. Our study highlights how Zika virus may still be 'silently' spreading in the Americas and provides a framework for more accurately understanding outbreak dynamics.",

Due, in part, to high rates of subclinical infections and overlapping symptoms with infections from dengue and chikungunya viruses (Mitchell et al., 2018) , Zika virus was circulating for more than a year and a half before it was first detected in Brazil (Faria et al., 2017) . By the time Zika virus was discovered in May of 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) and recognized for its ability to cause severe congenital disease (Fran\u00e7a et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016) , the virus had already spread from Brazil to more than 40 countries (Faria et al., 2017; Grubaugh et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017; Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al., 2018) . By mid 2017, reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO, 2017a) revealed Zika virus activity throughout the Americas was waning, prompting predictions for the end of the epidemic (e.g. (O'Reilly et al., 2018) ) and the removal of the World Health Organization's (WHO) \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" status (WHO, 2016a (WHO, , 2016b .",

For Zika virus and other Aedes aegypti mosquito-borne virusesincluding dengue and chikungunya viruses -that disproportionately impact those with limited resources (Braga et al., 2010; Gardner et al., 2018; Netto et al., 2017) , accurate local reporting is especially problematic. Not only are people in poor living conditions more likely to be exposed to infected mosquitoes, but such communities often have less access to adequate healthcare, resulting in more cases going undetected (Hotez, 2016; LaBeaud, 2008) . Pockets of virus transmission that occur in countries with inadequate reporting can therefore facilitate 'hidden' outbreaks, increasing the risk of infected travelers causing outbreaks in new regions of the world. Thus, underreported or unrecognized local outbreaks may prolong epidemics, and hinder global efforts aimed at halting virus spread.",

We hypothesized that similar frameworks could be leveraged to improve Zika virus surveillance, as many regions in the Americas affected by the epidemic attract large volumes of international visitors from countries with stronger healthcare and surveillance systems (Wilder-Smith et al., 2018) . In this study, we used international travel data, coupled with virus genomics, to detect ongoing Zika virus transmission that was missed by local reporting. We discovered a large Zika outbreak in Cuba that was not reported to PAHO (PAHO, 2017a) or other public health agencies, and thus went undetected to the international community. We show that the outbreak in Cuba peaked in 2017, when the epidemic in the rest of the Americas was waning (PAHO, 2017a) , and estimate that it was as large as those in neighboring countries that occured the year before. By sequencing Zika virus from infected travelers, we also show that the outbreak in Cuba was caused by multiple introductions from elsewhere in the Caribbean and Central America. Overall, our study outlines a framework for how traveler surveillance data, combined with virus genomics, can detect 'hidden' outbreaks and reconstruct transmission dynamics when local data are insufficient.",

Failure to do so leaves us vulnerable to surveillance 'blind spots', with the potential for prolonging epidemics and increasing their geographic spread. Zika virus was first detected in Brazil in May, 2015 (Zanluca et al., 2015) , yet studies have shown that the epidemic started at least one and a half years prior to its discovery (Faria et al., 2017) . Early in 2016, 48 countries across the Americas reported local outbreaks (PAHO, 2017b), with case numbers peaking later that year. By mid 2017, new Zika cases were no longer being reported to the international community (PAHO, 2017b). Due to widespread surveillance gaps and inconsistent reporting, however, we hypothesized that local Zika outbreaks could still be occurring in the Americas, despite not being captured by the international community. To investigate whether Zika virus transmission is still ongoing, we used international travel data to reveal that local outbreaks were still occurring in 2017, despite relatively few cases being reported (Fig. 1) . Our data demonstrate that the vast majority of Zika cases during 2017 were the result of an unreported Zika outbreak in Cuba, which occurred while public data suggested the epidemic was nearing its end in the Americas (PAHO, 2017a) (Fig. 1) .",

By examining potential source locations for the travelassociated Zika cases in 2017, we found that between June, 2017 and October, 2018 more than 98% of them came from Cuba (90 of 91 Zika diagnoses in Florida, 63 of 64 Zika diagnoses in Europe; Fig. 1B ). To further confirm the timing of a Zika outbreak in Cuba, we obtained travel-related infection data from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network (Hamer et al., 2017; Leder et al., 2017) and found that 76% of the Zika cases associated with travel from Cuba were diagnosed in 2017 (22 of 29; Fig. 1C ).

Our results therefore suggest that the 2017 Zika outbreak in Cuba was similar in size to the known 2016 outbreaks in countries with similar population sizes, such as Haiti (3,103 reported cases), Dominican Republic (5,305 reported cases), and Jamaica (7,165 reported cases; Fig. 2C ).",

Temperature is the primary seasonal factor driving Zika virus transmission as it influences mosquito development, survival, reproduction, biting rates, and vector competence (Caminade et al., 2016; Mordecai et al., 2017; Siraj et al., 2017) . Thus, we used a model that estimated when transmission was most likely to occur based on favorable temperature ranges for mosquitoborne transmission (Mordecai et al., 2017) . Using weather data for Cuba, we found that the Zika virus introductions into Cuba corresponded to the period of optimal local Ae. aegypti transmission potential (Fig 3C) . The timing of multiple Zika virus introductions during the summer of 2016 is therefore unsurprising, as they appear to have occurred when Zika virus activity was peaking in source locations and local Ae. aegypti transmission potential in Cuba was high. These findings, however, do not explain why transmission in Cuba did not peak until 2017, which was at least a year later than other local outbreaks in the Americas (PAHO, 2017b) ( Fig. 2A) .",

Using monthly airline passenger arrivals coming from all 48 countries and territories in the Americas known to have local Zika virus transmission from 2014-2017, we did not detect any large deviations in air traffic to Cuba when Zika virus was being introduced elsewhere in the Caribbean (starting in mid-2015; Fig. 4A ) (Faria et al., 2017; Metsky et al., 2017) . Moreover, air travel volumes were higher into Cuba than neighboring islands with large outbreaks in 2016, including Puerto Rico and Jamaica (Fig. 4A) .

We found that following large dengue outbreaks in Cuba in 2014 and 2015, dengue virus transmission subsided in 2016 before increasing in 2017 (Fig. 4B) . The dengue epi curves were similar to the Zika epi curves from 2016 to 2017 (Fig. 4B) , supporting the hypothesis that conditions in Cuba were not conducive for large Ae. aegypti-borne virus outbreaks in 2016.

Cuba has a long history of successful Ae. aegypti control (Gubler, 1989; Toledo et al., 2007) , and following the detection of the Zika outbreak in Brazil, the country implemented a \"National Zika Action Plan\" for aggressive Ae. aegypti mosquito surveillance and control (Gorry, 2016; Reardon, 2016) . To investigate if mosquito control may have played a role in delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba, we compared the reported start of the mosquito control campaign to Zika and dengue virus transmission (based on travel incidence rates) in Cuba (Fig. 4B) . We found that following the implementation of mosquito control in February, 2016, travel incidence data showed minimal transmission of both dengue and Zika viruses throughout the year (Fig. 4B) . By searching news articles for Zika and dengue in Cuba from 2015-2018, we found that Cuban officials reported that the mosquito control program was successful, based on a near elimination of dengue and very few Zika cases (see Supplemental File 3 for a timeline of selected news articles). However, no information was reported on the overall length of the campaign, and importantly, if it was still ongoing when the Zika outbreak intensified in 2017. The timing of the mosquito control campaign, followed by a decrease in both dengue and Zika cases (Fig. 4B ) -despite high transmission potential (Fig. 4B ) -suggests that mosquito control efforts may have been responsible for delaying the Zika outbreak in Cuba. The outbreak the following year was likely preceded by a resurgence in Ae. aegypti populations, leading to an increase in transmission of Zika virus lineages that were introduced in 2016 (Fig. 3) .",

Out of a total of ~4 million air travelers departing Cuba between June and December of 2017, we found 18 countries and US states that received >20,000 travelers, with >100,000 arriving in Florida, Canada, Mexico, and Spain (Fig. 5B) . Based on environmental suitability for Ae. aegypti of the 18 areas with >20,000 travelers from Cuba, we estimated that Florida, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia were most at risk of Zika virus having been introduced from Cuba during June-December, 2017 (Fig. 5B) . Indeed, four local Zika cases were reported in Florida during 2017 linked to their partners having recently returned from Cuba (FL DOH, 2017a .

However, there are important limitations to such approaches that may influence our ability to estimate the size of the Zika outbreak in Cuba. First, accurate travel data are necessary to calculate travel incidence rates of Zika cases. This is challenging for Cuba, as travel policies from the United States have repeatedly changed during the past few years (Robles, 2016) . To minimize this issue, we included air travel from both scheduled commercial flights from the International Air Transportation Association (IATA, 2018) and chartered flights from the U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT, 2018). Additionally, we also obtained travel-associated Zika virus case data from Europe, where the travel policies to Cuba to the best of our knowledge have not recently changed.",

Given our estimated size of the outbreak in Cuba, however, there are likely many additional Zika virus introductions not captured in our analyses . Our tMRCA estimates of the Zika virus lineages from Cuba suggest that the virus survived the low mosquito abundance season (i.e. 'overwintered' from November to March) to cause more intense transmission in 2017 after the local mosquito population rebounded. While the factors supporting virus 'overwintering' are still unclear, it is plausible that Zika virus may have survived low mosquito abundance through a combination of low level mosquito-to-human transmission, vertical transmission in mosquitoes (da Costa et al., 2018; Thangamani et al., 2016) , and, to a lesser extend, human sexual transmission (Althaus and Low, 2016). Considering that a large Zika outbreak in Cuba did not occur until after the viruses successfully 'overwintered', which may happen often with Zika outbreaks (Faria et al., 2017; Th\u00e9z\u00e9 et al., 2018) , better understanding of how Zika virus is maintained when mosquito abundance is low might lead to novel control methods.",

Cryptic Zika virus transmission is likely still occurring in regions of the Americas, however, incomplete surveillance and reporting make this difficult to confirm and quantify. Accurate Zika virus seroprevalence surveys (Balmaseda et al., 2017; Zambrana et al., 2018) are now needed to determine the extent of 'hidden' outbreaks of Zika, and to get more accurate measures of the true overall size of the epidemic. Open access to empirical mosquito abundance data is also critical for more precise forecasting of transmission potential and to evaluate control measures (Rund and Martinez, 2017) ; importantly, these efforts should be prioritized and more fully supported. Such initiatives, combined with our framework of using travelers as sentinels of Zika virus infections, can serve as complementary resources to detect, monitor, and reconstruct outbreaks when local surveillance is insufficient.",

The cases reported on the FL DOH database include those that were confirmed by both PCR and serological assays, and within and without symptoms onset dates (note that many of the pregnant women that were serologically positive for Zika virus were asymptomatic). A travel history was also recorded for most patients. For this study, we only included PCR positive cases with a known date for the onset of symptoms and who only traveled to one international location within the 2 weeks prior to symptoms onset so we could more accurately sort the temporal and spatial distribution of travel-associated cases. We also excluded cases with sexual or congenital exposure. We aggregated the data by month of symptoms onset and by location of likely exposure (i.e. travel origin). Of the travel-associated Zika cases diagnosed in Florida (n = 1,333), 49% were visiting friends and relatives, 17% were refugees or immigrants, 17% were traveling for tourism, 3% were traveling for business, and 14% were traveling for unknown or other reasons. Of the travelassociated dengue virus cases where the questionnaire was given (only started for dengue in 2016, n = 88), 67% were visiting friends and relatives, 25% were traveling for tourism, and 8% were traveling for other reasons.",

Second, many of the reported cruise-related Zika infections were associated with more than one site for potential exposure, making it difficult to estimate local incidence rates (we removed all travel cases with multiple locations of potential exposure from our analyses). Third, scheduled cruise ship passengers arriving in Florida that stopped in Cuba are predicted to be substantially fewer (11,675/month scheduled for 2019; crawled from CruiseMapper: https://www.cruisemapper.com/) than air travel passengers from Cuba to Florida (80,366/month in 2017) .

We limited our analysis of countries besides Cuba to those with a correlation between monthly local and travel cases >0.25 (n=27), which appeared to be a natural breakpoint in the distribution of correlations. For each, we used the fda (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fda/index.html) package in R to model per capita local incidence of Zika over time with univariate cubic B-spline functions with four knots per year for two years (2016-2017) described by parameters \u13af. We assumed that incidence among travelers from each country followed the same temporal pattern as local incidence but the two differed in magnitude by a factor \u13b3, which could be due to differences in exposure or health-seeking behavior between international travelers and the general population. To estimate \u13af and \u13b3 for each of the 27 countries, we modeled local and travel incidence for each month as independent binomial random variables, with incidence as the number of \"successes\" and country population and number of travelers, respectively, as the number of \"trials.\" Logit-transformed values of the spline functions informed the probability of success in each trial. Based on this likelihood formulation and with non-informative priors, we estimated \u13af and \u13b3 for each country using a Metropolis-Hastings implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We assessed convergence by calculating Gelman-Rubin statistics on five replicate chains, and we performed posterior predictive checks on cumulative local incidence (Fig. S2 ) and travel incidence (Fig. S3 ) (Thompson Hobbs and Hooten, 2015) . On the basis of Bayesian p-values < 0.05 on these posterior predictive checks, we removed four countries from subsequent analyses (leaving n=23 countries). To estimate per capita local incidence in Cuba, we first estimated \u13af for Cuba in a similar manner, but based on travel data only. We then took 10 4 values of \u13b3 drawn randomly from the posteriors of \u13b3 pooled across 23 countries and multiplied them by random samples from the posterior of per capita travel incidence curves from Cuba to obtain a set of 10 4 predictions of per capita local incidence curves for Cuba.

Then, a correlation between root-to-tip genetic divergence and date of sampling was conducted in TempEst (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003; Rambaut et al., 2016; Yang, 1994) . Timescaled phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework available in BEAST v1.10.2 . Accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty, we used an HKY+\u03934 nucleotide substitution model for each codon position, allowing for relative rates between these positions to be estimated, and an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model, with an underlying lognormal distribution (Drummond et al., 2006) , a non-parametric demographic prior (Gill et al., 2013) and otherwise default priors in BEAUti v1.10.2 . The MCMC analysis was run for 800 million iterations, sampling every 100,000th iteration, using the BEAGLE library v2.1.2 to accelerate computation (Ayres et al., 2012) . MCMC performance was inspected for convergence and for sufficient sampling using Tracer v.1.7.1 .

Virus transmission by Ae. aegypti can occur between 18-34\u00b0C and peaks at 26-29\u00b0C (Mordecai et al., 2017) . To assess yearly and seasonal variations in Ae. aegypti transmission potential for dengue and Zika virus, we used a temperature-dependent model of transmission using a previously developed R 0 framework (Mordecai et al., 2017) . By focusing this analysis on Havana, we controlled for spatial drivers of transmission and thereby isolated a representative example of temporal patterns in transmission potential. Using hourly temperature data obtained from OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/), we calculated monthly mean temperature and used it to calculate monthly R 0 as estimated by Mordecai et al. (Mordecai et al., 2017) (https://figshare.com/s/b79bc7537201e7b5603f). Doing so for 5,000 samples from the posterior of temperature-R 0 relationships and normalizing between 0 and 1 yielded a description of relative Ae. aegypti transmission potential per month in Havana, Cuba during 2014-2017.

Relative Ae. aegypti suitability (i.e. very low, low, mid-high, and high) was then derived by using the mean aggregated values for each U.S. state, country, and territory, and also the mean value for the study period (June-December, 2017).
