It detected all of 62 strains belonging to subgenus F (AdF) but only 4/40 non-AdF serotypes. This is possibly due to the concentration of AdF strains in faeces being greater than non-AdF strains. No false positive reactions were found with 55 AV-negative faeces, 42 of which contained other viruses frequently found in faeces. Only one of the 157 specimens examined gave a non-specific reaction, i.e. test and control latexes both agglutinated. All of 14 AV isolates but none of the 12 isolates of other viruses were LA positive.",

Low numbered serotypes, such as AV 1, 2 and 5, are often isolated in cell culture but may not be of aetiological significance. Of greater importance are those belonging to subgenus F (AdF), i.e. types 40 and 41, which account for about 10% of cases of juvenile gastroenteritis'. Diagnosis is usually made by electron microscopy (EM) of faeces but about a third of those detected may be non-AdF strains?. However AdF strains tend to be present in significantly greater numbers than non-AdF serotypes. Enzyme immunoassays (EIA) which may be group (Gp) rotavirus diagnosiP as they are rapid and ideal for examining small numbers of samples. although not as sensitive as EIA. have also been developed for detecting AV. Grandien and colleagues7 considered one test to be 100% specific with sensitivities of 100% and 95% compared with EIA and EM respectively. Approximately three-quarters of the positive samples in their study were AdF serotypes but they did not state specifically the numbers detected by EM and EIA or jointly by both tests. They also found that 13% of the total samples examined gave non-specific reactions, i.e. test and control latexes both agglutinated.",

Of those, 99 were EM positive and had been classified as AdF and non-AdF serotypes. of which there were 62 and 37 respectively, by Gp and AdF EIAs (Adenoclone, Croft Biotech Ltd, Wetherby, UK) and isolation in cell culture followed by specific neutralization during previous studies'. The other three AVpositive samples were negative by EM but had been found to contain AV 1 or 5 by isolation; one was also weakly positive by Gp EIA. The remaining 55 samples of the cohort were considered to be AV negative by EM, Gp EIA and isolation in cell culture. Forty-two were known to contain other viruses: 19 were rotavirus positive, nine enterovirus. six small round structured viruses. including calicivirus and Norwalk-like agents, three coronavirus and three astrovirus.",

The method recommended by the supplier was followed for examining faeces. Dilution buffer was prepared by dissolving one of the buffer tablets supplied (constituents not stated) in 100 ml distilled H20. An approximate 10% suspension of each faeces was prepared by thoroughly mixing about 0.1 g sample with 1 ml buffer in clean plastic 75 X 12 mm tubes. The suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. One drop (approximately 50 ~1) of supernatant was placed in each of two circles on a glass agglutination plate: to one a drop of test latex was added and a drop of control latex to the other. These were mixed with the tip of a wooden swab stick and the plate gently rocked. The time taken for any agglutination to occur was noted. A sample was deemed positive if definite agglutination of the test latex, but not control latex. occurred with 3 min rocking. The strength of reaction was graded from + to +++: a + reaction in which there was slight granularity of the latex, but not unequivocal agglutination, was considered to be negative. If both test and control latexes clumped the reaction was classified as non-specific. Cell culture isolates were tested as described above except that undiluted culture fluid was used in place of the faecal extract.",

It has been shown previously' that clinically-significant AdF strains in faeces are often excreted in large numbers (>107 ml-l); non-AdF serotypes are usually excreted in smaller numbers and are of doubtful clinical significance. It is clear that the LA test described here requires the presence of large numbers of virus particles to be reliable. This is confirmed by the reactions obtained with cell culture AV isolates which usually contain in excess of 10' particles per ml. Unlike Grandien et al.'s7 study which reported LA being positive with 9112 (75%) of faeces shown to contain non-AdF serotypes, only 10% (4/40) were LA positive in the present one. This suggests that their test was more sensitive than the one used in this study. but no conclusion may be drawn specifically as comparisons of this nature need to be done on the same cohort of specimens. It is possible that a greater proportion of our non-AdF positive samples contained low concentrations of particles, although 37/40 were EM positive suggesting IOh virions ml-' at least.",

The present study also shows that LA would be useful for confirming AV isolates rapidly as all but one of 14 examined reacted strongly. The likely explanation for the isolate, positive only after re-incubation, is that there were insufficient extracellular particles in the medium when first examined with virtually all the progeny being cellassociated at that stage. During re-incubation the particle concentration in the medium clearly increased so that a positive result was obtained on re-testing. This suggests that physical disruption of infected cells to release progeny virus, by freeze-thawing or sonication, would be advantageous.",
