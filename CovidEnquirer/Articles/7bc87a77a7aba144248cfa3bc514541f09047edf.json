For example, it is often assumed that the sequences evolved along a single bifurcating tree and that the evolutionary processes operating at the variable sites in the sequences are independent and identically-distributed processes. If model-based molecular phylogenetic methods are chosen, the underlying assumption usually is that the evolutionary processes operating at the variable sites can be approximated accurately by using Markov models that are stationary, reversible, and homogeneous (63-65) over time (the assumption of evolution under SRH conditions). In practice, the choice is one between methods assuming that the underlying evolutionary processes can be modelled using a Markov model of nucleotide or amino-acid substitutions (i.e., distance methods (66-71), likelihood methods (66,68,70-76), analysis. However, if a researcher's expectations are met by the phylogenetic results, it is more likely that a report will be written without a further assessment of what might have gone wrong during the analysis. This tendency-allow prior expectations to influence the interpretation of phylogenetic estimates-is called confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is not discussed in phylogenetics, even though it is well recognized as a critical factor in other disciplines (e.g., psychology and social science (121)), so it is timely that the phylogenetic community takes onboard the serious implications of this.",

But to mitigate its limitations, it will be necessary to redesign the protocol to accommodate well-established, but largely-ignored, procedures as well as new feedback loops. Figure 2 shows a proposal for new phylogenetic protocol. It shares many features found in the current protocol (e.g., the first four steps). However, the fifth step (assess phylogenetic assumptions) will be novel to many researchers. As all phylogenetic methods are based on assumptions, it is sensible to validate these assumptions at this point in the protocol. Since many phylogenetic methods assume that the data (e.g., different genes) have evolved over the same tree, and that the chosen data partitions have evolved independently under the same time-reversible Markovian conditions, it is wise to survey the sub-MSA for evidence that the sequences actually have evolved under these conditions. If the data violate these phylogenetic assumptions, then it will be wise to avoid these phylogenetic methods and to employ other such methods. Alternatively, it may be worth following the relevant feedback loops in Figure 2 -perhaps something led to a biased sub-MSA? The relevance and benefits of this step are illustrated using a case study (Box 1), which focuses on determining whether a data set is consistent with the phylogenetic assumption of evolution under time-reversible conditions. Assessments of other phylogenetic assumptions require other types of tests and Next follows the choice of phylogenetic method, but now this choice is made on the basis of the previous step, rather than on cultural or computational reasons. If the sequences have evolved on a single tree under time-reversible Markovian conditions, there is a large set of phylogenetic methods to choose from (66-85). On the other hand, if these data have evolved under more complex Markovian conditions, the number of suitable phylogenetic methods is, frustratingly, rather limited (5,64,146-171), and most of these methods are aimed at finding the optimal model of sequence evolution for a given tree rather than finding the optimal set of trees.

In brief, using the inferred optimal tree, including the edge lengths, it is possible to simulate data sets under the null model (i.e., the inferred optimal model of sequence evolution with its parameter values included).

The tetrahedral plots in Figure 3a -3c reveal that the nucleotide composition at the three codon positions is heterogeneous, implying that the evolutionary processes that operated at these positions are unlikely to have been time-reversible. However, the plots are deceptive because the presence of constant sites (i.e., sites with the same nucleotide or amino acid) in the data can mask how compositionally dissimilar the sequences actually are. To learn how to resolve this issue, it is necessary to focus on the evolution of two sequences on a tree (Fig. 3d ) and the corresponding divergence matrix at time 0 (Fig. 3e) and at time (Fig. 3f) . At time 0, the two sequences are beginning to diverge from one another, so the off-diagonal elements of the divergence matrix are all zero. Later, the divergence matrix may look like that in Figure 3f . All the off-diagonal elements are now greater than zero, and the so-called matching offdiagonal elements of the divergence matrix might differ (i.e., 23 \u2260 32 ). The degree of divergence between the two sequences can be inferred by comparing the off-diagonal elements to the diagonal elements, while the degree of difference between the two evolutionary processes can be inferred by comparing the above-diagonal elements to the below-diagonal elements. If the two evolutionary processes were the same, the matching off-diagonal elements in Figure 3f would be similar. A lack of symmetry (i.e., 23 \u2260 32 ) implies that the evolutionary processes along the two descendant lineages may be different. Because the dots in these plots do not fall along the diagonal line in the plots (showing that a lack of symmetry is not statistically significant), there is an overwhelming evidence that the evolutionary processes at these positions do not match a time-reversible Markovian process.",

Each dot represents the nucleotide composition of a single sequence. The spread of dots in panels a -c reveals compositional heterogeneity at first, second, and third codon position, indicating these data violate important assumptions underlying most phylogenetic methods.

Panels e and f show the divergence matrix for these sequences at time 0 and time . Each number in a cell of a divergence matrix corresponds to the number of sites with nucleotide in one sequence, and nucleotide in the other.

            "text": "There is a dire need for MSA methods that yield accurate homology statements. Likewise, there is a need for methods that allow users to: (i) determine how accurate different MSA methods are, and (ii) select MSA methods that are most suitable for the data at hand. Moreover, there is a dire need for better transparency in the way MSAs are reported in the literature (61). Methods for Masking MSAs -Assuming an accurate MSA has been inferred, there is a need for strategies that can be applied to identify and distinguish between poorlyaligned and highly-variable regions of MSA. Well aligned but highly-variable regions of MSAs may be more informative than poorly-aligned regions of such MSAs, so to delete them may be unwise. For example, the evolutionary process may have to be considered an evolving entity in its own right. Further, a better understanding of the information criteria used is necessary (178). Phylogenetic Methods -While there are many accurate phylogenetic methods for analysis of data that have evolved under time-homogeneous, reversible Markovian conditions, there is a dearth of accurate phylogenetic methods suitable for analysis of data that have evolved under more complex conditions. Added to this challenge are methods that accurately consider incomplete lineage sorting of genetic markers and the special conditions associated with the analysis of SNP data. Goodness-of-fit Tests -Suitable goodness-of-fit tests are available, but there is not only a need for a wider understanding of the merits of these tests, but also of how they can be tailored to suit different requirements. In particular, there is a need for programs that can generate simulated data under extremely complex evolutionary conditions. Some programs are available (5,160,175,179), but they only cater for a very limited set of conditions.",
