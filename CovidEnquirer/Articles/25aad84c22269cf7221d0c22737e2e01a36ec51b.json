Their fidelity, including indel generation, is significant for their use as reagents including for deep sequencing. Here, we report that certain RNA template structures and G-rich sequences, ahead of diverse reverse transcriptases can be strong stimulators for slippage at slippageprone template motif sequence 3 of such 'slippagestimulatory' structures. Where slippage is stimulated, the resulting products have one or more additional base(s) compared to the corresponding template motif. Such structures also inhibit slippagemediated base omission which can be more frequent in the absence of a relevant stem-loop. Slippage directionality, base insertion and omission, is sensitive to the relative concentration ratio of dNTPs specified by the RNA template slippage-prone sequence and its 5 adjacent base. The retrotransposon-derived enzyme TGIRT exhibits more slippage in vitro than the retroviral enzymes tested including that from HIV. Structure-mediated slippage may be exhibited by other polymerases and enrich gene expression. A cassette from Drosophila retrotransposon Dme1 chrX 2630566, a candidate for utilizing slippage for its GagPol synthesis, exhibits strong slippage in vitro. Given the widespread occurrence and importance of retrotransposons, systematic studies to reveal the extent of their functional utilization of RT slippage are merited.",

A well known Paramyxovirus heteropolymeric slippage motif is composed of A's followed by G's with the identity of the mis-paired base in the new re-aligned hybrid being important in determining slippage directionality (30, 31) . Nearly all work has focused on slippage involving a linear (unstructured) template. However, there is evidence that a protein roadblock or template structure ahead of a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase transcribing a slippage motif can stimulate realignment (2, 32, 33) . Also there is one report of roadblock-mediated RT slippage where a polymerase bypasses an RNA-structure forming sequence prior to resumption of synthesis (34) .

However, RTs do not contain 3 exonuclease proofreading activity and their templates are prone to form structures at the ambient temperature at which these enzymes act. Better reagent polymerases have been developed from thermophilic DNA-dependent DNA polymerases by adapting their catalytic activity to function with RNA templates (39) (40) (41) , or derived from existing RT polymerase by genetic engineering (42) . Though the derived enzymes have the beneficial quality of lower base mis-incorporation due to higher accuracy for substrate selection (39) , their indel fidelity remains to be explored.",

These specified the WT, or a variant, of the 'model' RNA stem-loop structure 5 adjacent to 7A's. The first construct 'wtSL-A7' has the WT sequence specifying the 'model' stem-loop 5 -GCGGGCgcaaGCCCGC-3 , with the potential of base pairing indicated in upper case. The second 'MUTsl-A7' has the 5 side sequence of the stem substituted by complementary nt bases, i.e. from 5 -GCGGGC-3 to 5 -CGCCCG-3 to prevent potential formation of the model stem-loop structure ( Figure 1A and B). RT reactions were performed with all dNTP equimolar at 500 M. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with Taq polymerase to yield the 'RT-PCR products'. The controls for Taq polymerase slippage used two chemically synthetized 75 nt DNAs, whose sequence corresponds to that of the test RNA sequence, used as template for PCR amplification. This yields the 'PCR products' referred to below. Next, the two RT-PCR and the two PCR products were used as templates for Limited Primer Extension (LPE) analysis for detecting the addition or omission of a base(s) in the T/Atract derived sequence. LPE reactions were performed with one primer whose sequence is complementary to the template sequence adjacent to the T-tract present in one of the two strands of the RT-PCR and PCR products [the other DNA strand has the corresponding A-tract]. The conditions of the LPE reaction enable the primer to be extended to the first template base position at which termination was arranged to occur by incorporation of an acyclic dGTP (acyGTP) base. This leads to efficient termination at the first base C of the template encountered by the polymerase during extension of the primer as the corresponding dGTP standard substrate is absent from the reaction (see Materials and Methods). The C at which LPE termination occurs is 5 adjacent to the T-tract (other sites and acyclic dNTPs are used as controls in Supplementary Data). The length of the LPE product also depends on the occurrence of any indel in the T-tract motif. In absence of slippage of the DNA polymerases used for amplification of the chemically synthesized DNA (Taq polymerase control) and subsequently for generation of the LPE product (Vent exo \u2212 polymerase), a homogeneous length LPE product is expected. This is used as a length marker. Comparison of the pattern of the LPE product(s) generated from RT-PCR with the marker reveal specific RT polymerase slippage-mediated base indels (Figure 1C ).",

To assess whether this also pertains with Reverse Transcriptase realignment, different dNTP concentration ratios were assayed. Nine dNTP ratio combinations with 5, 50 or 500 M for the dTTP (specified by the A-tract slippage motif) and 5, 50 or 500 M for the dGTP (specified 5 adjacent to the template motif) were tested; the dATP and dCTP substrates were each present at 500 M. Presence of the 'model' WT stem-loop stimulated addition of T ( Figure  1D , lanes 4-9); this stimulation was increased with higher At the highest dTTP concentration tested, a modest level of base addition is also observed but only at the highest ratio of [dTTP]:[dGTP] (lane 16). These results indicate that the RNA stem-loop is a strong stimulator for RT SuperScript\u2122 III realignment directionality, promoting addition of an extra T in the cDNA, but not the omission of a T. Interestingly, in absence of the RNA stem-loop structure, realignment directionality is the inverse. This directionality difference indicates that the RNA stem-loop is also a strong inhibitor for omission of a base complementary to a template base. In summary, realignment efficiency and directionality is influenced by the relative dNTP concentrations and by RNA template structure. products derived from the cDNA template, and of the PCR products derived from the synthetic DNA template.

RT reactions were performed with 3 dNTP ratio conditions for the substrates: To determine the potential importance of the identity of the RNA template base, C, 5 adjacent to the A7 motif in wtSL-A7 ( = wtSL/C-A7) and MUTsl-A7 ( = MUTsl/C-A7), the C was substituted by G to give the constructs 'wtSL/G-A7' and 'MUTsl/G-A7'. Also in the WT construct a compensatory base substitution was made in the sequence specifying the 5 base of the 5 side of the stem to maintain base pairing ( Figure 4A ). In the MUT construct a corresponding substitution to preclude base pairing was not necessary as its potential partner is already G ( Figure 4B ). The second set of constructs 'wtSL/U-A7' and 'MUTsl/U-A7' is as the first set except for the base adjacent to the motif being C with corresponding compensatory base substitutions (A and U respectively) to maintain (wt), or to abolish (MUT), stem-loop structure formation ( Figure 4C and D). RT reactions were performed using three specific dNTP concentration ratios (1:1, 100:1 and 1:100) for the dNTP substrate specified by the slippage motif and the RNA base adjacent to the motif. LPE analysis showed a similar result as obtained with the WT and mut 'stem-loop' model structure where the last base of the sequence specifying the 3 side of its stem has the base C 5 adjacent to the A7 motif. The RT slippage followed the dNTP ratio 'rules' where higher substrate concentration specified by the slippage motif stimulates base addition ( Figure 4E, lanes 2, 5, 8 and 11 ), and where higher substrate concentration specified by the template base 5 adjacent to the motif, stimulates base omission ( Figure 4E, lanes 3, 6, 9 and 12) .

With the wtSL constructs, base addition is stimulated, and with the MUTsl constructs it is inhibited ( Figure 4E , compare lane sets 1-2 with 7-8, and 4-5 with 10-11).

The 'dNTP rule' is that a higher concentration of the cognate substrate specified by the template base 5 adjacent to the slippage motif, than of the substrate specified by the motif, favors slippage-mediated base omission. When the ratio is reversed, slippage-mediated base addition is favored. The concentration of each dNTP used in our RT reaction with retroviral RT polymerase is in the M range whereas with the Retrotransposon-derived TGIRT polymerase, the highest ratio is in the mM range. The equimolar dNTP conditions used in the present in vitro work are similar to those used in cDNA preparation for NGS analysis. The dNTP imbalance conditions used in the present work were relatively high, 10-fold. Even with ca. 3-fold dNTP imbalance substantial effects on DNA polymerase fidelity have been detected in vivo. Notably, the phenotype associated with an analogue of a colorectal cancer causing DNA polymerase mutator mutant is due to its causing an S-phase checkpoint-dependent elevation of dNTP pools (52) . Other results also point to important correlations of dNTP pool levels with DNA polymerase mutator activities (53) , and mutants of a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase that influence the level and balance of dNTP pools, are frequent in colon cancer cells (54) .",

Evidence for this assertion comes from several aspects of the results. Firstly, high relative substrate concentration specified by the motif base inhibits slippage that generates product lacking a base compared to the template. This is perhaps due to pairing of substrate base with the template base at the catalytic center as it would prevent pairing of the forward realigned cDNA 3 end base ( Figure 6B) . Secondly, the finding that relatively higher concentration of the substrate, specified by the template base 5 adjacent to the motif, strongly stimulates base omission, is explicable by re- Figure 6 .

Backward realignment-mediated base addition (C-G) occurs from a polymerase Pre-translocation state stimulated by the formation of the template structure (H), and is productively locked by incorporation of the cognate substrate (G-C). alignment locking following this template base locating in the catalytic center ( Figure 6 from F to D). Consistent with this, availability of the base 5 adjacent to the RNA motif is crucial for base omission since its sequestration in template stem pairing (intra-template or antisense pairing) ( Figure  6H ) inhibits base omission ( Figure 6 , from F to D). Accordingly, a requisite for productive forward realignment is that prior to its occurrence, the RT polymerase is in a posttranslocation state with the 3 end of the cDNA being base paired to the template base second from the 5 end of the RNA motif ( Figure 6B ). Even though substrate base pairing serves to lock realigned hybrid pairing, the potential for reversal of realignments is indicated by the strong effect of relative dNTP concentration on modulating slippage directionality. This implies that substrate pairing is slower than realigned hybrid formation.",

Though this model involves realignment of the 3 end of the cDNA in either direction with respect to the template, it does not give any explanation about the trigger for the realignment process. A previous model for HIV-1 RT slippage-mediated base omission involves 'template-strand slippage' with a separate model for HIV-1 RT base addition involving 'primer-strand slippage' (35) . These models feature either potential formation of an extrahelical base (a bulge) or base sharing. WT HIV-1 RT enzyme has a fivefold greater efficiency for base addition than base omission (35) . Substitution of HIV-1RT Glu89 by other residues leads not only to a decrease of slippage-mediated base omission in favor of an increase of base addition, but it also leads to a decrease of base substitution errors. Glu89 is in close proximity to the sugar phosphate backbone of the template strand near the penultimate base pair. Its importance for fidelity and slippage directionality has been suggested to be due to increased dNTP binding pocket stability (35) . An alternative explanation linked to our model, is that WT and position 89 variants differentially favor the pre-and posttranslocation states. Knowledge of a possible correlation between WT and position 89 variants and both HIV-1 RT translocation state and slippage directionality, would be informative.",
