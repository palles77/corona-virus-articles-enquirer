            "text": "Winter dysentery (WD) is a contagious disease caused by bovine coronavirus. It is characterized by acute onset of diarrhea, fever, depression, and reduced milk yield in adult cattle. Although production loss is a well-known consequence of WD, large-scale studies estimating the effect on milk production are lacking. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of farmer-reported WD on herd-level milk production and milk composition. A cohort study was performed based on reports of herd outbreaks of winter dysentery during a regional epidemic in Norway during the winter of 2011-2012. Reports were made by farmers, and diagnosis was based on a herd outbreak of acute diarrhea in adults. Milk shipment data were retrieved from the dairy company, and information on herd size and milking system were retrieved from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. We compared milk production in herds with reported outbreaks of WD (n = 224) with all herds in the same area without a reported outbreak (n = 2,093) during the same period. The outcome variable in the analysis was milk volume per cow per day, and the main predictor was whether the herd had a reported outbreak of WD or not. We assessed the effect of WD on milk production by fitting a linear mixed model, adjusting for milk production in the herd before the outbreak. Similarly, we assessed the effect of WD on milk composition using linear regression, adjusting for the levels of milk components before the outbreak. This study estimated a total loss of 51 L/cow during the study period, from 7 d before to 19 d after a reported outbreak. The lowest estimated production was 2 d after the outbreak was reported, when the average milk yield was 19.4 L/cow per day, compared with 23.0 L/ cow per day 7 days before notification (i.e., a difference of 3.6 L/cow, or 15%). The effect gradually declined with time. The estimated effect on milk composition was modest, but an increase of 11% in free fatty acids and a small increase in fat/protein ratio indicated that WD might put cows into negative energy balance. Descriptive analysis indicated that herd milk yield was still reduced 4 mo after an outbreak. This cohort study showed that WD causes considerable decreases in milk production, and it alters milk composition. These findings highlight the important negative consequences of WD, and should motivate actions to prevent betweenherd spread of bovine coronavirus.",

            "text": "Winter dysentery (WD) in dairy herds is characterized by the sudden onset of diarrhea in several adult cattle (Clark, 1993) . It typically occurs as epidemics during the winter, and is caused by bovine coronavirus, which is endemic in cattle populations worldwide (Saif, 1990; Alenius et al., 1991; Paton et al., 1998; Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . Previous studies have shown high prevalence in the Norwegian national dairy herd as well. Gulliksen et al. (2009) found that 39% of examined calves were antibody positive, and Toftaker et al. (2016) found antibodies in bulk tank milk in 72% of all study herds. Bovine coronavirus also causes calf diarrhea and respiratory disease in both calves and adult animals (Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . The clinical signs of WD include watery diarrhea with or without blood in the feces, fever, depression, decreased milk production, anorexia, and sometimes cough or nasal discharge (Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . Mortality is low, but morbidity in affected herds is high, and outbreaks can result in poor herd health and reduced animal performance (Clark, 1993; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001; Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . Reduced milk production is an important consequence for the farmer, because of associated economic losses. The acute drop in milk yield associated with WD is well known, but estimates of the magnitude of this drop are often based on a few animals or on outbreaks in only a few herds. Furthermore, the reported magnitude of this drop varies widely (Durham et al., 1989; Fleetwood et al., 1989; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001) .",

Salmonellosis, bovine viral diarrhea, and Schmallenberg virus infection were ruled out. Later in the outbreak, laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis was usually not performed. During this epidemic, the advisory service of the largest dairy company (TINE SA) developed a voluntary surveillance system in the eastern part of Norway, where farmers and veterinarians were encouraged to report outbreaks of contagious diarrhea, so that herd-level biosecurity measures could be implemented. The farmers were advised to report outbreaks of acute diarrhea affecting several adult cattle. These reports were the basis for the present study.",

The average annual herd size was retrieved from the annual summary tables of the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System, using the number of cow-years in 2012 (or 2011 for the herds that lacked a record for 2012).

Variables assessed as possible confounders were herd size, milking system, and milk production in the period before the outbreak. The distribution of DIM was also calculated in both groups of herds. Pairwise correlations between all predictors were assessed. To allow for a different effect of time since outbreak/pseudo-outbreak for WD+ and WD\u2212 herds, an interaction term between WD and number of days since outbreak was included in the model. To assess linearity for the continuous predictor days after outbreak, smoothed line plots were drawn visualizing their relationship with the outcome. For the WD+ herds, the relationship was clearly nonlinear, so different transformations were tried. Models were compared based on Akaike's information criteria, and the best fit was accomplished by modeling the interaction term as a cubic spline. Knots were chosen a priori based on biological considerations, and knots at d \u22123, 2, 7, and 14 were used (Vittinghoff et al., 2012) . Finally, assessment of the effect of WD on milk production was carried out by fitting a linear mixed model with a herd random effect to account for dependence between repeated milk shipments from each herd. The model was fit using a manual backward stepwise procedure, with a selection threshold of P < 0.05. We used the restricted maximum likelihood approach. Ten different correlation structures were explored for the random effect: autoregressive (AR1 and AR2), moving average (MA1) and Toeplitz 1 to 7. The different correlation structures were evaluated by comparing log-likelihood and Akaike's information criteria. Residuals on herd and shipment level were assessed for possible outliers and normality plots, and plots of residuals against predicted values were made. Predicted values were calculated, and average herds in terms of milk production before outbreak were visualized through a line plot. To obtain confidence intervals for selected predicted values, the variance was calculated as suggested by Kleinbaum et al. (1982) . The total loss per cow over the study period was calculated as the difference in estimated milk production per day between WD+ and WD\u2212 herds plus the initial difference at the start of the study period (d \u22127).",

Descriptive statistics of daily milk production 21 to 8 d before notification, daily milk production 0 to 19 d after notification, herd size, milking system, and production type (freestall/ tiestall) in WD+ and WD\u2212 herds are shown in Table  1 . The study herds had milk shipments 1 to 16 times, with a mean of 11 shipments from 7 d before to 19 d after the day of notification. Milk shipments happened at uneven intervals, typically with either 2 or 3 d intervals [mean 2.5, SD 1.4]. The distribution of milk components in the WD+ and WD\u2212 groups is shown in Table 2 . The average herd size was 25.7 cow-years (SD 16.0), and the overall average milk production from 21 to 8 d before the outbreak was 22.2 L/cow/ day (SD 6.0).

For an average herd, the total estimated loss per cow was 51 L for the entire study period, from 7 d before 19 d after notification. Former studies vary widely with respect to the magnitude of drop in milk yield. A few studies have explored the effect of WD on milk production at the herd level. One study reported that 90% of farmers had observed a decrease in milk yield after WD, but farmers were not asked to quantify the loss (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1993) . A study describing an outbreak of WD in 2 herds in Canada reported that herd-level milk production dropped to less than half of normal production (Durham et al., 1989) , and Jactel et al. (1990) estimated a drop of 6 to 30%, based on outbreaks in 7 herds. The latter study emphasized the large variation in severity of disease among the study herds, which was in line with the large spread in drop in milk production we found in the present study (Figure 4) . Studies including only a few herds generally have limited generalizability, and that, combined with large variations in severity at both the cow and herd level, likely contributes to variations in estimates of the effect of WD on milk production between studies. An observational study Figure 4 . Histogram showing the distribution of maximum drop in milk production for herds that reported outbreak of winter dysentery (WD+). Maximum drop was calculated as the difference between the minimum daily production from 0 to 19 d after the day of notification and the average production before the outbreak (from 21 to 8 d before the day of notification).

Milk production before the outbreak was set to the study sample mean of 22.2 L/cow per day for 21 to 8 d before the day of notification. Color version available online. by Beaudeau et al. (2010) did not reveal any effect of seroconversion for bovine coronavirus in pooled milk samples of primiparous cows on test-day milk yield. However, seroconversion for bovine coronavirus does not necessarily mean that the herd had a WD outbreak. Furthermore, samples were taken 6 mo apart, making the exact time of virus introduction unclear, and the use of test day records for milk yield provides an additional limitation, because they are typically taken 1 month apart. Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al. (2001) found that milk production was reduced by 19 to 56% at the cow level in an experiment with 5 naturally infected cows. Comparing herd-level evaluations to cow-level studies is problematic, because a herd might consist of a mixture of na\u00efve, immune, noninfected and infected animals, and the infection might vary from subclinical to severe. For the same reason, the results of the present study are not generalizable to individual cows. The relatively large sample size, the cohort of WD\u2212 herds from the same area for comparison, and access to milk shipment data for calculations of daily milk production were major strengths of the present study.",

            "text": "Milk production in the WD+ herds was still reduced 150 d after outbreak, compared with a slight increase in production for the WD\u2212 herds. However, uncertainty about causal inference increases with time since an outbreak. Furthermore, the long-term effect likely depends on the number of cows infected, the duration of clinical signs in the herd, and the number of new cows calving in the period after outbreak. Hence, the factors affecting long-term effects at the herd level are likely complex. We had no information on the factors mentioned in the current study. Virtually no other studies exist describing the long-term effects of WD, although Jactel et al. (1990) described reduced production up to 28 d for 1 study cow, and Clark (1993) stated that decreased production might last several months. This is the first large-scale study to show altered milk composition as an effect of WD. The change in composition was small except for the increase in free fatty acids of about 11% for WD+ herds. Jactel et al. (1990) reported a decline in fat and protein content in 2 herds with WD outbreaks, but did not measure free fatty acids. However, an increase in free fatty acids has been described for bovine herpes virus 1 (Rola et al., 2015) , and might be associated with negative energy balance due to anorexia or increased energy demand in diseased cows. The fat/protein ratio has been used as an indicator of lipo-mobilization (Toni et al., 2011) , and the observed increase in this parameter gives additional support to the theory that negative energy balance is a consequence of WD. Increased free fatty acids in milk can be associated with reduced quality and cause offflavor (Santos et al., 2003) , and are therefore important for farmers for economic reasons, because they might affect the price of the milk.",

However, the rapid spread of disease strongly indicated a contagious disease, and bovine coronavirus was confirmed as causative agent in some herds where diagnostics was performed. The Norwegian dairy herd is free of many infectious diseases that could be mistaken for WD. Feed-related diarrhea is also a differential diagnosis for WD, and because farmers' ability to distinguish WD from other causes of diarrhea probably differs, some exposure was likely misclassified in the WD+ group. Reporting of WD to the advisory service of the dairy company was done voluntarily, and because this might be associated with underreporting, misclassification of exposure was also likely present in the WD\u2212 group. Assigning pseudo-notification dates was done to minimize this problem: although many herds recorded as WD\u2212 probably had an outbreak during the winter season of 2011 to 2012 but failed to report it, it was less likely that such an outbreak would fall within the 27 d that represented the time at risk for this analysis. Altogether, the uncertainty regarding time of outbreak, the likely underreporting of WD, and the fact that the diagnosis was done by farmers means that the drop in milk production found in this study should be considered a conservative estimate (bias toward the null). As well, the negative effect of WD on milk production likely represents only a part of the total economic loss associated with a WD outbreak. Other effects of WD, such as adverse effects on reproduction, effects on calves and young stock, and treatment costs were not investigated in this study.",

We did this analytically by including prior milk production in the model. The WD+ herds were also larger than the WD\u2212 herds on average (see Table 1 ), indicating that large herds were more likely to make a report, or that large herds had increased risk of clinical outbreak of WD. The latter has been described by White et al. (1989) .
