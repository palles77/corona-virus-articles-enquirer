Immunohistochemical testing of biopsy specimens and postmortem examination are the standard diagnostic methods, although direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing to detect feline coronavirus in macrophages in effusion specimens has been reported to have 100% specificity and has been recommended as an antemortem confirmatory test. The aim of this study was to compare the results of DIF testing in antemortem feline effusions with postmortem results using field samples. Effusion specimens were collected antemortem from 17 cats and tested by DIF, followed by postmortem examination. Histopathological examination of specimens collected at postmortem confirmed FIP in 10/17 cases and ruled out FIP out in 7/17 cases. Antemortem DIF testing was positive in all 10 cases confirmed as FIP at postmortem examination. In the seven cats where FIP was ruled out at postmortem examination, DIF was negative in five cases and positive in the remaining two cases. The calculated sensitivity of DIF testing was 100% and the specificity was 71.4%. Duplicate effusion specimens from eight cats that were initially DIF positive were stored refrigerated (4\u00b0C) or at room temperature (22-25\u00b0C) and subjected to serial DIF testing to determine the duration of positive results. DIF-positive specimens stored at both temperatures retained their positive status for at least 2 days.",

The ability of FCoV to replicate inside macrophages is an essential virulence factor for the development of FIP (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Rottier et al., 2005) . The disease is characterised by widespread immune-mediated vasculitis and/or pyogranulomas, manifesting as an effusive form, with high protein effusions in body cavities, or a non-effusive form (Wolfe and Griesemer, 1966; Montali and Strandberg, 1972; Pedersen, 1976) . The effusive form of FIP is more common than the non-effusive form, although the relative prevalence of non-effusive cases appears to be increasing (Pedersen, 2009) . FIP is usually fatal (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008) .",

Clinical signs are often non-specific, hematological and biochemical abnormalities are not pathognomonic, and serological tests and PCR have relatively low diagnostic accuracy (Hartmann et al., 2003) . The standard methods for diagnosis are histological examination (of biopsies, but more usually at postmortem examination) and immunohistochemical analysis of affected organs (Sparkes et al., 1991; Paltrinieri et al., 1999; Hartmann et al., 2003; Addie et al., 2004) . Biopsies collected antemortem are usually not an option because of the risks of surgery in cats that are already in poor health (Addie et al., 2004) . Collection of specimens using minimally invasive techniques, such as fine needle aspirates or needle core (Tru-cut) biopsies, can reduce the anesthetic risks, although these tests have poor sensitivity (Giordano et al., 2005) .",

In the present study, the DIF test was negative when performed on an effusion specimen collected at postmortem examination from one of the false positive cases (case 5). In the other case (case 12), the effusion collected at postmortem examination was not subjected to DIF testing, but intestine and pooled liver and kidney collected at postmortem examination were positive on DIF testing. In practice, since the DIF test provides more rapid results than tests designed to detect FCoV antibodies or antigen, clinicians might be inclined to submit an effusion specimen for DIF testing as part of the exercise of 'building up tiers of evidence' for or against a diagnosis of FIP (Addie et al., 2004). The sensitivity of DIF testing in this study was 100%, which is higher than in previous studies (Cammarata Parodi et al., 1993; Hartmann et al., 2003;  Table 2 ). It is possible that differences in the anti-FCoV antibody conjugate used in each of the three studies affected sensitivity. In the two previous studies, the antibody used was a commercial feline polyclonal FITC-conjugated antiserum which detects both feline infectious peritonitis biotypes 1 and 2, and cross reacts with transmissible gastroenteritis virus and canine coronavirus (catalogue number CJ-F-FIP, VMRD; Cammarata Parodi et al., 1993; Hartmann et al., 2003) . In the study by Cammarata Parodi et al. (1993) , specimen processing took place within 15 h of collection and a sensitivity of 95.2% was reported. Information on the time between specimen collection and processing was not provided for the study by Hartmann et al. (2003) , which reported a DIF test sensitivity of 70.3%.",
