Also here Iatrobeads chromatography was applied as a final fractionation and purification step of the trisialogangl ioside fraction obtained by IEC. Ivamori and Nagai (1978b) presented results o f the isolation and characterization of a gangl ioside (monosialosylpentahexaosylceramide) from human brain. Using a combination of IEC and Iatrobeads chromatography, approximately 2.1 umol of an unknown ganglioside were obtained from 1 kg of human brain (this amount comprised 0.09% of the total lipid-bound s i a l i c acid in the brain). The characterization procedures were described. Ivamori and Nagai (1981~) studied monosialogangl iosides of rabbit skeletal muscle and characterized a novel N-acetyl neuraminosyl lacto-N-noroctaosyl ceramide. After IEC (DEAE-Sephadex, DEAE-Sepharose) the monosial ogangl ioside fraction was further fractionated by LCS on Silica gel 60 and Iatrobeads columns.",

The TyrI6' peptide was linked with human serum albumin using bis-diazotized benzidine. In preliminary experiments, the peptide showed good reactivity with an antiserum directed toward the complete virus, b u t immunization with the albumin-conjugate (peptide t o protein ratio = 8: 1 ) gave no virus neutralizing anti bodies. Krchfidk and Ma19 (1986) used modern technology t o prepare and t e s t synthetic antigen fragments i n which the isolation of the real intact-protein antigen was not necessary. The principle of t h i s approach can be illustrated by the following steps: ( 1 ) determination of the DNA sequence expressing the antigen; (2) selection of the corresponding protein fragment(s1 based on theoretical translation; Ddlling e t a l .

When the carboxylic groups are largely undissociated ( a t pH 2 ) , the retention of PtGlun increases with the number of Glu residues and the elution order parallels that in IEC. A t sufficiently high pH (e.g., a t pH 4.5) the carboxilic groups are dissociated and the elution order i s reversed (cf., Fig. 12.7) . The logarithm of the capacity factor i s linearly dependent (with the exception o f FA) on the number o f Glu residues over a wide range of eluent pH ( c f . , Fig. 4 in the original paper). As can be seen from Fig. 12 .8, a t pH 6 ( a t which the carboxyl groups are almost completely dissociated) the retention decreases with increasing number of Glu residues, so t h a t both methods (IEC and RPC) complement each other.
