Enteric fever and acute hepatitis, both vaccine preventable, were less common, diagnosed in only 2% and 1%, respectively, of febrile returning travelers. Rickettsioses were also rare as a cause of fever, occurring in only 2% of cases. Rates of hospitalization due to post-travel fever range from 20 to 30%, with Plasmodium falciparum malaria being the most likely specific cause of hospitalization in this setting. In general, high-risk areas for the acquisition of febrile illnesses include sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania are \"hot spots\" for malaria acquisition, whereas South Central Asia contributes many cases of travel-acquired enteric fever (i.e., typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever due to Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi, respectively). Travelers returning with rickettsial infections have traveled almost exclusively to sub-Saharan Africa, while dengue infections are most commonly acquired in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and, increasingly, the Caribbean. With the emergence of chikungunya in the Americas in late 2013, and Zika in late 2015, these viral infections remain on the differential diagnosis of fever in travelers returning from all parts of the Caribbean, and Central and South America, as well as areas of prior endemicity, such as the Indian Ocean islands.",

The efficacy of the current hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine series is >90%. When a dose of oral polio vaccine is repeated in adult life, as recommended for risk of exposure, vaccine efficacy approaches 90-100%. Thus, a documented history of recent vaccination administered appropriately renders the diagnosis of yellow fever, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or polio unlikely, while illnesses with poorer vaccine efficacy, such as typhoid fever and influenza, remain more probable. Similarly, administration of immune globulin within 3 months of exposure makes hepatitis A highly unlikely.",

Spontaneous bleeding suggests the possibility of infection with one of the hemorrhagic viruses (e.g., Lassa fever, yellow fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever) but is also reported with various bacterial and rickettsial diseases (Table 20.6). Bleeding may range from easy bruising typical of mild dengue to severe epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and possible spontaneous central nervous system hemorrhage seen with severe hemorrhagic viral diseases. Diarrhea associated with fever is typically caused by common bacterial agents of traveler's diarrhea such as Campylobacter species, enterohemorrhagic, enteroaggregative, and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Entamoeba histolytica, and intestinal viruses. Occasionally, febrile diarrhea may present due to other gastrointestinal pathogens such as hookworm, coccidia such as Cyclospora cayetanensis or Cryptosporidium, and rarely with Giardia lamblia.

Many of these pathogens are restricted to certain ecologic niches, so the patient's geographic itinerary, season of travel, and exposure history are essential. For example, Japanese encephalitis virus is limited to the Far East, is a disease of summer in temperate climates, and is transmitted by mosquitoes. Spinal cord disease associated with fever can result from West Nile virus, schistosomiasis, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection, or polio virus infection. Cutaneous manifestations of disease are common but seldom specific (Table 20 .9). The erythema chronicum migrans of Lyme disease and rose spots in typhoid fever are examples of unique, specific rashes. Nonetheless, rash can refine a differential diagnosis considerably. For example, an eschar at the site of inoculation is typical of tick typhus, boutonneuse (Mediterranean spotted) fever, and anthrax. Cutaneous ulcers are seen in leishmaniasis, tropical phagedenic ulcer, Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans), cutaneous amebiasis, arthropod bites, syphilis, yaws, tuberculosis, and leprosy. When evaluating a patient who has received previous treatment, it is important to recall that rash and fever can be caused by reactions to drugs, such as sulfa drugs, antimalarials, and other antibiotics. Rickettsial diseases are frequently associated with rash, but the absence of rash may be misleading and does not exclude the possibility of rickettsial disease (see Table 20 .13). Genital ulcers, such as those seen with syphilis, chancroid, and lymphogranuloma venereum, should be construed as markers of exposure to other sexually transmitted diseases that should be excluded in affected travelers, as well.",

A careful history covering pre-travel prophylaxis, itinerary, travel style and exposures, apparent incubation period, fever pattern, symptoms, previous treatment, and diagnostic studies is essential. Laboratory tests to consider in the diagnostic evaluation include blood smears for malaria (and Borrelia, trypanosomes, Babesia, etc.), complete blood count and white cell differential, absolute eosinophil count, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, hepatic transaminases, urinalysis, chest radiograph, tuberculin skin test, hepatitis serologies, and bacterial cultures of blood, urine, and stool. In many instances, it is prudent to obtain and save an acute serum sample for future comparative serologic studies. Suspected cases of viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe malaria, and enteric fever should be immediately hospitalized. Travel in a rural African environment is a significant risk factor for exposure to viral hemorrhagic fevers, although other hemorrhagic viruses, including those causing dengue fever, Hantaan, yellow fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, have a more cosmopolitan distribution in widely scattered parts of the world (Table 20.6).

The patient should be instructed to keep a temperature record and return in 2-3 days if fever fails to resolve, or sooner if symptoms worsen. Empiric treatment for enteric fever (and/or rickettsioses) may be considered in patients who continue to have fever >48 hours after all diagnostic work-up has been initiated but in whom specific tests have been noncontributory (see Public Health Agency of Canada, Fever in the Returning Traveller 2011). Because the majority of travel-related febrile illnesses are self-limited viral syndromes, most fevers will resolve spontaneously. If fever persists, however, repeat malarial smears and blood cultures are warranted. Directed serologic studies to detect diseases compatible with the patient's history and physical examination should be considered. Imaging studies (e.g., abdominal computed tomography or ultrasound) and biopsies (e.g., bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes) may be indicated. Hospitalization may be justified to expedite the work-up in certain circumstances. During the evaluation of perplexing cases of apparent travel-related illness, the clinician should bear in mind that non-infectious disorders, such as pulmonary embolism, occult malignancies, systemic lupus erythematosus, and temporal arteritis, may present with fever. Presumptive empiric therapy directed against a likely pathogen may be justified, especially when adequate diagnostic studies are not readily available or a patient is clinically deteriorating.

Although malaria is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 21, key points are worth repeating here. P. falciparum infection can be life-threatening when associated with high parasitemia, blackwater fever, cerebral malaria, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chemoprophylaxis is often effective, but only when taken as directed. Of the 231 cases of severe malaria in travelers reported to the CDC in 2012, 75% were due to P. falciparum, and 79% of these infections were acquired in sub-Saharan Africa; only 7 of 200 patients in whom information on prophylaxis was known were adherent to their drug regimen. However, drug-resistant P. falciparum is now widespread, and even perfect compliance with prophylaxis does not provide absolute protection from malaria infection. The case-fatality rate for P. falciparum in US travelers was approximately 0.4% in 2012 (6 deaths among 1687 total cases). Clinical manifestations of P. vivax and P. ovale infections can develop up to 5 years after exposure. The diagnosis of malaria in immune individuals or individuals who have received prophylaxis or partial treatment may be complicated by low parasitemia. Multiple blood smears in combination with highly sensitive rapid diagnostic tests or, occasionally, nucleic acid amplification tests such as polymerase chain reaction may be helpful in difficult cases (see also Chapters 6 and 21).",

Of the 1902 laboratory-confirmed cases of typhoid fever reported by Lynch and colleagues (2009 Lynch and colleagues ( ) between 1999 Lynch and colleagues ( and 2006 in the United States where epidemiologic information was available, foreign travel in the preceding 30 days was reported by 79%, yet only 5% had received typhoid vaccine prior to travel. Seventy-three percent of cases were hospitalized, and 0.2% died. Resistance to antimicrobials has been reported for S. typhi isolates in many countries, although fluoroquinolones are usually effective against typhoid fever acquired outside the Indian sub-continent and Southeast Asia (Chapter 31).",

Sporadic urban transmission still occurs in large outbreaks in Africa. Although A. aegypti is ubiquitous in the Far East, yellow fever virus transmission has never been reported from this region. The reason is unclear, but either the lack of virus importation into the region or possible immune cross-resistance induced by endemic dengue immunity may be responsible.

Travelers at increased risk are those going abroad to perform medical service and those residing abroad for prolonged lengths of time. Occasionally, tuberculosis transmission has been reported among air travelers as the result of relatively poor air turnover on airlines and the presence of a passenger with active pulmonary tuberculosis. In a study of American healthcare workers returning from Botswana, tuberculin skin test conversion occurred in 4.2%, corresponding to a rate of 6.87 per 1000 person-weeks of travel (Szep et al. 2014) . Healthcare workers, missionaries, teachers, and others who anticipate close daily contact with resident populations in countries where the incidence of tuberculosis is high should receive the tuberculin skin test before travel to establish a baseline status, and 8-12 weeks following travel (see Chapter 25).",
