PED has also been documented in South-East Asia since the 1980s (Song and Park, 2012) . However, variant strains of PEDV causing severe outbreaks of disease in suckling pigs with high morbidity and mortality appeared in 2010 in China (Li et al., 2012) . Furthermore, and since April 2013, very similar PEDV strains to the Chinese variants have been Veterinary Microbiology 174 (2014) [427] [428] [429] [430] [431] [432] Bovine plasma was inoculated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) at an average final titer of 4.2 log10 TCID 50 /mL to determine the effect of spray drying on viral inactivation. Using a laboratory scale drier, inoculated plasma was spray dried at 200 8C inlet temperature and either 70 or 80 8C throughout substance. Both liquid and dried samples were subjected to three passages on VERO cell monolayers to determine PEDV infectivity. Results indicated liquid samples contained infective virus, but none of the spray dried samples were infectious. Also, survivability of PEDV inoculated on spray dried bovine plasma (SDBP) and stored at 4, 12 or 22 8C was determined for 7, 14 and 21 days. Commercial SDBP powder was inoculated with PEDV to an average final titer of 2.8 log10 TCID 50 /g. Five samples per time and temperature conditions were subjected to three passages on VERO cell monolayers to determine PEDV infectivity. The virus was noninfectious for all samples stored at 22 8C at 7, 14 and 21 days. PEDV was infective in 1 out of 5 samples stored at 12 8C at 7 days, but none of the samples stored for 14 and 21 days were infectious in cell culture. For samples stored at 4 8C, 4 out of 5 samples were infectious at 7 days, 1 out of 5 samples were infectious at 14 days, but none were infectious at 21 days. In summary, PEDV was not infectious on cell culture within 7 days when stored at room temperature and within 21 days when stored at refrigerated temperature.",

This strain of PEDV is well known to propagate on VERO cells and was selected as a model swine coronavirus to study inactivation of PEDV by spray drying. PEDV was propagated in VERO cell line, grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic combination (penicillin 100 IU/mL, streptomycin 100 mg/mL). Virus stock was produced in VERO cells seeded in 175 cm 2 flask to confluent monolayers, cells were rinsed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline and inoculated with 10 ml of PEDV 3.5 log10 TCID 50 /mL (MOI of 0.002) to each bottle. The virus-cells mixture was incubated 1 h at 37 8C, and then the inoculum was replaced with post-infection media (PM), which consisted of MEM supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma), 12.5 mg/mL trypsin (Sigma) and the above mentioned antibiotic combination (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989) . Cultures were checked at 18 and 24 h after infection to assess syncytia formation and the evolution of cytopathogenic effect (CPE) until reaching nearly 100% CPE. Liquid supernatants and scraped cells were collected. The pooled suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 g for 20 min at 4 8C and supernatants were stored at 4 8C. The resulting pellet was suspended in PM and subjected to freeze-thaw, centrifuged and supernatants were harvested and added to bulk supernatants. Stock virus was stored at \u00c080 8C or used immediately after its production (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989) . A PEDV virus stock was produced to a virus titer ranging between 4.0 log10 and 5.0 log10 TCID 50 /mL (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989; Song et al., 2003; Oh et al., 2005) .",

These results are in agreement with previous publications indicating that PEDV is a low thermal stable virus (Song and Park, 2012) . In addition, these results agree with previous reports with different enveloped The spray dryer concentrated liquid plasma 10 times; the expected virus titer in the dry product was 5.15 AE 0.2 log10 TCID 50 /g. c The theoretical limit of detection of the method used was estimated to be able to detect as low as 0.7 viral particles/g. viruses like PRRSV and PRV (Polo et al., 2005) and a nonenveloped virus like SVD (Pujols et al., 2007) . These studies demonstrated that the commercial spray drying conditions used for the manufacturing process of commercial SDP should be sufficient to eliminate low-medium heat resistant viruses like PEDV. The normal processing temperature condition used by commercial SDP manufacturing plants is >80 8C throughout its substance. The present data indicated that drying at 70 8C throughout its substance was already adequate to inactivate at least 5.15 log10 TCID50/g of this virus. Therefore, the heat treatment used during the commercial spray-drying process is theoretically more than adequate to inactivate PEDV if present in the raw material. Recent data would support such conclusion Opriessnig et al., 2014) . In the first study, researchers used raw plasma from a non-infected pig spiked with wild type US strain of PEDV and either fed directly as raw liquid spiked plasma or spray-dried it (in a laboratory drier at 83 8C outlet temperature) and fed to na\u00efve pigs. Their results indicated that the raw liquid spiked plasma was infective but the spray dried spiked plasma was not infective, indicating that spray drying at outlet temperature around 80 8C should be enough to inactivate the PEDV . In the second study, piglets received a diet with 5% SDPP containing 5.1 AE 0.1 log10 PEDV RNA copies/g and showed no evidence of infectivity by the existing PEDV RNA present in the SDPP lot utilized . PEDV viremia has been reported only once in gnotobiotic pigs experimentally infected with PEDV genogroup 2 (Jung et al., 2014) . It is usually accepted that PEDV RNA detected in serum is possible at the peak of disease, but viremia is reported to be short and of low magnitude (Pensaert, 1999) . Therefore, it appears unlikely that PEDV viremia and utilization of blood from viremic pigs is a main source of PEDV contamination of SDPP. Probably, the presence of this virus in raw blood is more likely attributed to carcass contamination at time of slaughter Opriessnig et al., 2014) .",

However, virus concentration diminished considerably for the samples stored at 4 8C or 12 8C for 7 days compared to samples immediately stored frozen at \u00c080 8C. Importantly, samples stored at room temperature did not contain infective PEDV by 7 days of storage, which is consistent with previous data reported by other researchers. They demonstrated that PEDV-positive feces spread evenly on the bottom surface aluminum tray and treated at 20 8C for 7 days were non infective when feed-back to na\u00efve pigs by oral-gastric tube (Thomas et al., 2014) . Also, it is important to highlight that, even at 4 8C, the virus was not infectious in cell culture after 21 days of storage. The fact that spray dried blood products are powders with low moisture (below 8%) and water activity (<0.6) are important, since PEDV does not survive very long under dry conditions (OIE, 2014) .",

These results indicated that qRT-PCR Ct values were not different between samples (p > 0.05), independently of the storage conditions. However, differences between days (p < 0.05) at each temperature condition should be indicative of progressive genome degradation. Moreover, the qRT-PCR positive results compared to those generated by cell culture of the virus indicated that the former technique is not a good indicator to establish PEDV infectivity. However, it is also true that virus isolation might not be highly sensitive; therefore, a swine bioassay would be the most definitive way to demonstrate the putative infectivity of those qRT-PCR positive samples which were negative after inoculation of VERO cells.",
