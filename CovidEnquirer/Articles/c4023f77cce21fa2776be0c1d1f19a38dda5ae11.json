Bacteria, viruses and yeast represent three types of microorganisms, which form a significant component of biota, exhibiting unique functions due to their peculiar cell structure. For example, yeast are eukaryotic, while bacteria belong to the prokaryotic group. However, viruses are obligate intracellular parasites which are considered non-living organisms. Due to the genetic diversity of microorganisms, it is believed that microbes were the first life recorded on Earth, long before the existence of any plant or animal. Some microorganisms have been studied for their unique ability to survive at extreme environmental conditions. For example, some species of microbes can survive well in extreme cold regions of Antarctica, while others survive in hot water springs at 90\u00b0C and above, in places with highly alkaline soils, high concentrations of heavy metals and Sulphur and in locations where no other forms of life can survive. Millions of microbial species exist in the natural environment but only 5% of these (totalling 160,000 known species) have been identified so far (Minocheherhomji, 2016) .",

The visual microbiological world was further extended in the 1880s by the combined work of Ernst Abbe and Carl Zeiss further advancing the field of light microscopy. Ernst Ruska made it possible to study the structure of viruses with the advent of the electron microscope in 1931. Subsequently, crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was carried out by Wendall Stanely in 1935. More recently, the atomic force microscope (AFM) has opened a new path for the investigation and manipulation of structures on a very small scale in the study of biological structures by providing high resolution images under physiological conditions, and to investigate the binding forces between microorganisms and target surfaces. Microbiology mainly deals with visual characterization of various microbial groups (Fig. 1 ).",

The U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) defines nanotechnology as the research and development efforts at the atomic or molecular level to create structures and systems applicable in diverse aspects (Balzani, 2005; Drexler & Peterson, 1989) . The history of nanotechnology lies in the 4th and 5th centuries BC, when traditional medicinal practitioners in India and China succeeded in preparing gold colloids (known as 'Suwarna Bhasma' in ancient ayurveda in India) for therapeutic purposes (Paul & Chugh, 2011) . During the middle ages in Europe, Paracelsus applied colloidal gold in treating mental disorders and syphilis (Dykman & Khlebtsov, 2012) . With the periodical advancement in 1618, a book on the preparation and therapeutic applications of colloidal gold was published by the Philosopher and Doctor, Francisco Antonii. The first scientific publication of colloidal gold was published by Michael Faraday in 1857. However, real interest in the field of nanomaterial science was (Feynman, 1960) . This concept of nanomaterial science was further popularized by Eric Drexler through his book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology in the 1980s. Currently, the field of Nanotechnology has spread its wings in medical, pharmaceutical, industrial, food and agriculture, and environmental sectors with a wide range of applications (Fig. 2) .",

The amalgamation of these fields offers innovative and sustainable solutions in a rational manner. In the present chapter, we highlight the relationship between these disciplines identifying the great potential resulting from interdisciplinary research. Nanoscience impacts several areas of Microbiology. It allows for the study and visualization at the molecular-assembly levels of a process.

It has taken $23 billion to bring safe drinking water and sanitation to everyone over 8-10 years, especially in African and Asian countries. An important challenge is therefore the rapid, specific and sensitive detection of waterborne pathogens in water sources. Presently, microbial detection is based essentially on time-consuming culture methods like most probable numbers, defined substrate method, antibody-based detection and others. However, newer enzymatic, immunological and genetic methods are being developed to replace and/or support classical approaches to microbial detection. Moreover, innovations in nanotechnology and nanosciences are having a significant impact in wastewater or sewage wastewater decontamination. For example, a nanomembrane is a porous thin-layered material that allows water molecules to pass through while restricting the passage of bacteria, viruses, salts, and metals. Electrospun nanofibres and nanobiocides have shown potential in the improvement of water filtration membranes. Biofouling of membranes caused by the bacterial load in water reduces the quality of drinking water and has become a major problem. Several studies showed inhibition of these bacteria following exposure to nanofibres with functionalized surfaces. Nanobiocides such as metal nanoparticles and engineered nanomaterials have been successfully incorporated into nanofibres showing high antimicrobial activity and stability in water (Botes & Cloete, 2010) .",

UV-disinfection represents an alternative for oxidative disinfection, since they generate fewer DBPs, but a high dosage is required for certain viruses, such as adenoviruses. All these limitations suggest the need for the development of alternative methods that can enhance the robustness of the disinfection process, while avoiding DBP formation (Li et al., 2008) . Materials such as nano-Ag, nano-ZnO, nano-TiO 2 , CNTs and fullerenes exhibit antimicrobial properties without strong oxidation because they have a lower tendency to form DBPs (Hossain et al., 2014; Li et al., 2008) .

In addition, the costs associated with the large-scale production of NPs hinders the widespread application of NPs. Cost efficiency could be achieved by reusing or recycling nanomaterials. Overall future research must be aimed towards safety evaluation, large scale production facilities, safe disposal practices, cost and energy efficiency for NPs production and disposal to address the key issues related to scaling up of nanomaterials for environmental benefit.

In Australia alone the cost of food waste to the economy is more than $8 billion each year. As a result of intensification of food production over the past 50 years there are now four major food safety challenges including: (i) emergence of new food pathogens, (ii) adulteration of food materials, (iii) unknown effects from long term consumption of genetically modified food and (iv) the presence of significant amounts of chemical contaminants/pollutants in our food (Yuan et al., 2015) . Numerous factors are contributing towards an increase in different food safety issues. These include the industrialization and mass production of agricultural products, the growing number of imported food products and variations in food consumption patterns due to changes in consumer lifestyle (Motarjemi, Stadler, Studer, & Damiano, 2008) . Moreover, consumers are leaning towards ready-to-eat meals and fast foods to save cost and time. As a result many new food borne pathogens have emerged or existing pathogens have re-emerged because of these new types (e.g. raw and fast food) of transmission vehicles. As a result, many foodborne outbreaks have occurred in the last 20 years by bacteria, viruses and protozoa, and many more pathogens are being introduced via food contamination every year (Maru\u0161i c, 2011). The annual cost of medical treatment, lost productivity, and illness-related mortality is estimated at $55.5 billion in the United States alone (Kowitt Fortune magazine, May 2016).",

Among all, silver acts differently from other antimicrobials and showed broad-spectrum toxicity to numerous strains of bacteria, fungi and algae and possibly to some extent for some viruses (Rai, Yadav, & Gade, 2009 ). Nanosilver causes significant structural changes in bacterial cell wall and cell membrane due to its binding to key proteins causing cell disruption and eventually death. The binding of nanosilver to DNA and RNA can also cause death by inhibiting bacterial replication. Hence, silver nanoparticles are widely applied as a sterilizer of freezedried foods and an antiripening agent by food companies. Two other antimicrobial mechanisms exhibited by nanoparticles were proposed by Rabea, Badawy, Steven, Smagghe, and Steurbaut (2003) , based on the chelation of trace metals by chitosan, inhibiting microbial enzyme activities, and (in fungal cells) penetration through the cell wall and membranes to bind DNA and inhibit RNA synthesis. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have also been reported to have antibacterial properties as direct contact with aggregates of carbon nanotubes can kill E. coli, possibly due to the puncturing of microbial cells by the long, thin nanotubes, causing irreversible damage and leakage of intracellular material.",

            "text": "Oxygen (O 2 ) is responsible in many ways for food deterioration, such as oxidative reactions causing browning reactions and rancid flavours, etc. Food deterioration by the indirect action of O 2 includes food spoilage by aerobic microorganisms. In such circumstances, O 2 scavengers could inhibit the spoilage process by the incorporation of O 2 scavengers into food packaging systems to maintain very low O 2 levels. Such O 2 scavenging films were developed by Xioa-e, Greens, Haque, Mills, and Durrant (2004) by adding TiO 2 NPs to different polymers. Nanocomposite materials can also be used as packaging film for a variety of oxygen sensitive food products. The role of nanosensors incorporated in food packaging in the detection of pathogens and toxins in food products represents a key emerging field of application (Bhattacharya, Jang, Yang, Akin, & Bashir, 2007) . The application of fluorescent nanoparticles for the detection of pathogens and toxins in food is of particular interest (Burris & Stewart, 2012) ; foodborne pathogenic bacterial species such as Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and E. coli can be detected by quantum dots coupled with immunomagnetic (due to Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles) separation in milk and apple juice (Zhao et al., 2008) . Light scattering is another way of detecting the presence of E. coli in food products. The technique works on the principle that a protein of a known and characterized bacterium set on a silicon chip can bind with any E. coli present in the food sample resulting in nanosized light scattering, detected by analysing the digital image (Horner, Mace, Rothberg, & Miller, 2006) . A similar technique was reported by Fu, Huang, and Feng (2008) for the detection of Salmonella in food products. Silicon/gold nanorods were incorporated with anti-Salmonella antibodies and fluorescent dye, which became visible when attached to bacteria.",

Monochromatic light from a laser source is coupled to a channel waveguide and is guided into four parallel channels (one reference channel and three measuring channels). This facilitates simultaneous detection of three different viruses as the individual channels were coated with specific antibodies (Ymeti et al., 2007 (Ymeti et al., , 2005 . The detection of avian influenza virus through whole-virus capture on a planar optical waveguide has already been described (Xu, Suarez, & Gottfried, 2007) . The assay response is based on the index of refraction changes that occur upon binding of virus particles to unique antigen-specific (haemagglutinin) antibodies on the waveguide surface.",

Recently, scientists have become more and more interested in the interaction between inorganic molecules and biological species. Studies have found that many microorganisms can produce inorganic nanoparticles through either intracellular or extracellular routes (Luo, Shanmugam, & Yeh, 2015) . Semi-conductive QDs are the most promising potential materials used in biomedical diagnosis. Xiong et al. (2014) designed targetable cellular beacons for diagnosis of pathogens using the biosynthesis strategy coupled with the antibody-combination ability of Staphylococcus aureus. Taherkhani, Mohammadi, Daoud, Martel, and Tabrizian (2014) presented another facile strategy in an application for cancer therapy using the magnetosomes derived from the bacteria Magnetospirillum marinus MC-1. Ghosh et al. (2012) used engineered M13 virus combined with phage display technique and magnetic nanoparticles for targeting diagnosis of prostate cancer. Furthermore, quasi-biosynthesized Ag 2 Se QDs were good candidates for use as lowtoxicity fluorescent tags for in vivo imaging diagnosis (Gu, Cui, Zhang, Xie, & Pang, 2012) . Overall, these cases provide selected examples of the biomedical application of biosynthesized nanomaterials.

Further innovations are inevitable as this interdisciplinary science develops. However, though the application of nanotechnology and microbiology represents an exciting and formidable combination, the toxicity of the engineered nanomaterials/nanoparticles (ENPs) to the environment and human health could raise serious concerns. Therefore, it is important to ensure that potential ecotoxicity, health and environmental impacts of ENPs in terms of the fate of ENPs when released into the environment through various pathways is fully considered. No matter the numerous avenues of nanoscience applied in medical, immunology, agriculture and the food sector, the positive and negative roles of NMs needs to be investigated prior to in vivo studies. There is an urgent need to understand their mechanism of action, life cycle, targeted and non-targeted delivery system and fate in the food chain of living organisms. Adequate regulations on nanotechnology applications in food and related agri-food products, surface, fresh or waste-water, drug development and delivery should be developed and monitored stringently.
