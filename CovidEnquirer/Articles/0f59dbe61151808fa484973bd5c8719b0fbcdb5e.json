A more frequent drought-monsoon cycle supports outbreaks of malaria transmitted by water surface ovipositing Anopheles species mosquitoes and dengue and Chikungunya fever outbreaks transmitted by container-breeding Aedes species mosquitoes. As nighttime temperatures increase and glaciers and permafrost retreat into the highlands, the geographic distribution ranges of mosquito and tickborne diseases extend to higher altitudes and to new regions in formerly disease-free areas with competent insect vectors.

Emerging infectious diseases may be defined as those that have recently appeared in human populations, have expanded their ranges of distribution, or threaten to increase their prevalences and distribution ranges in the near future. Today most emerging infectious diseases arise in the natural environment as zoonoses, such as Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); or adopt a competent, new insect vector, such as Aedes albopictus, a new mosquito vector for dengue and Chikungunya viruses ( Figure 1 ). Reemerging infectious diseases may be defined as those whose pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment strategies are well known but have reemerged as public health threats, often with increased antimicrobial drug resistances, such as multidrug resistant tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.",

In 1983, two cases of P. falciparum malaria were diagnosed in persons without histories of travel to malaria-endemic regions living 10 and 15 km from Gatwick Airport. Hot, humid weather in Britain may have facilitated the survival of imported, infected anopheline mosquitoes. During the summer of 1994, six cases of airport malaria were diagnosed in the vicinity of Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris. Four of the patients were airport workers, infected at work, and the others were residents of Villeparisis, a small town approximately 7.5 km away from the airport. To reach Villeparisis, the infected anopheline mosquitoes were thought to have hitched a car ride with airport workers who lived next door to two of the patients. In addition to airport malaria transmitted by infected mosquito air travelers, many countries throughout the developed world are reporting an increasing number of cases of imported malaria because of the great increase in long-distance air travel by infected passengers. Malaria cases imported from Africa to the United Kingdom rose from 803 in 1987 to 1165 in 1993.",

Adult worms mature in rat brains, enter the central circulation, and mate in the pulmonary arteries producing eggs. The eggs become first-stage larvae that penetrate pulmonary vessels to access the respiratory tree, where they are coughed up, swallowed, and excreted in feces. These second-stage larvae must be consumed by land snails or slugs to mature into infective third-stage larvae, be eaten by rodents, and maintain the parasite's life cycle. Man becomes a dead-end host by consuming raw intermediate mollusk hosts, or food items contaminated by their slime, or by consuming raw, crustacean (shrimp, crabs, fish, and frogs) transport, or paratenic, hosts that consumed infected mollusks. In man and paratenic hosts, the neurotropic larvae migrate to the CNS (neural larva migrans) seeking to mature into young adults as in rat brains but eventually die causing EM.",

The larvae mature into infective thirdstage larvae in these transport or paratenic hosts, encyst in tissues, but do not develop into adults, unless the paratenic hosts are consumed by definitive carnivorous hosts. Once infective larvae are consumed by predators, they will mature into adults in the stomach and restart the parasite's life cycle ( Figure 5 ). Since humans are not the natural definitive hosts, infective larvae consumed by humans in raw foods will not develop into adults but will penetrate the gastrointestinal tract and migrate hematogenously causing cutaneous or visceral larva migrans in any organ system. Typically, the most common foods containing infective larvae have included fish, shrimp, crab, crayfish, frog, snake, and chicken. However, most human cases have followed consumption of raw or citrus-marinated fish (ceviche) or shellfish. In 2003, GNS caused by G. spinigerum was first recognized as an emerging imported helminthic infection in the United Kingdom in a case series of 16 patients treated over a 12-month period. In this series, the median incubation period was 12 months; peripheral eosinophilia was present in 7 (44%) of the 16 patients, and was not a reliable screening tool; and cases presented with a myriad of symptoms ranging from migratory cutaneous swellings (also known as Yangtze edema in Asia, or nodular eosinophilic migratory panniculitis in the United States) to eosinophilic gastritis.",

Inside cells they transform into amastigotes.Amastigotes multiply by binary fission in cells of infected tissues.Trypomastigotes can infect other cells and transform into intracellular amastigotes in new infection sites. Clinical manifestations can result from this infective cycle.Intracellular amastigotes transform into trypomastigotes, then burst out of the cell and enter the bloodstream.Figure 6The life cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative protozoan parasite of Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis.

Global warming has significantly extended the distribution range for T. cruzi-infected reduviids north of latitude 461. A migration of armadillos, opossums, nutrias, other rodents, and raccoons, into forested suburban areas has expanded domestic wild animal reservoirs for Chagas disease, especially in the southeastern United States; and outdoor-kenneled dogs are now the major domestic animal reservoirs of Chagas disease in the United States. An initial human migration of Latin Americans with asymptomatic Chagas disease, often acquired in childhood, from rural villages to Latin American cities and peri urban slums resulted in epidemics of urban transfusion and transplant-related Chagas disease in Latin America. Subsequent massive emigration of Latin Americans to US cities has resulted in expanded human reservoirs of T. cruzi-infected persons, estimated at over 200 000, now donating blood and organs to limited stockpiles.",
