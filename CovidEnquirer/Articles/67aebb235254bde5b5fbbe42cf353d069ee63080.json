            "text": "One of the difficulties in the study of perinatal and postnatal diseases is the variation in the type of age classification that occurs between publications, which makes it difficult to compare results and assessments. The term perinatal is usually used to describe morbidity or mortality that occurs at birth and in the first 24 hours of life. The term neonatal is usually used to describe morbidity or mortality between birth and 14 days. However, there is variation in the use of these terms. To ensure that our meanings are clear, we set out in the following section what we think is the most satisfactory classification of all the diseases of the fetus and the newborn, which is adapted from a scheme proposed for lambs. The importance of this type of classification is in the assessment of risk for a given type of disease and in the prediction of likely causes that should be investigated by further examinations. This approach is not of major importance in the assessment of disease in an individual animal, although it is of importance in helping establish the priority in diagnostic rule-outs. The classification is, however, of considerable value in the approach to perinatal morbidity and mortality in large flocks or herds, where an assessment of the age occurrence of morbidity and mortality can guide subsequent examinations to the probable group of cases, with optimal expenditure of investigative capital.",

Deaths that occur during this period are unlikely to be caused by an infectious disease unless it has been acquired congenitally. Most diseases occurring in this period are noninfectious and metabolic (e.g., hypoglycemia and hypothermia as a result of poor mothering, hypothermia as a result of exposure to cold, low vigor in neonates as a result of malnutrition). Congenital disease will commonly manifest during this period but may sometimes manifest later. Infectious diseases are often initiated during this period, but most manifest clinically at a later age because of their incubation period; some (e.g., navel infection, septicemic disease, and enterotoxigenic colibacillosis) have a short enough incubation to occur during this period. \u2022 Delayed postnatal disease (2 to 7 days of age). Included in this category are desertion by the mother, mammary incompetence resulting in starvation, and diseases associated with increased susceptibility to infection as a result of failure in the transfer of colostral immunoglobulins (the predisposing causes to these occur in the first 12 to 24 hours of life). Examples include colibacillosis, joint ill, lamb dysentery, septicemic disease, and most of the viral enteric infections in young animals (e.g., rotavirus and coronavirus). \u2022 Late postnatal disease (1 to 4 weeks of age). There is still some influence of hypogammaglobulinemia, with late-onset enteric diseases and the development and severity of respiratory disease in this period, but other diseases not directly associated with failure of transfer of immunoglobulins, such as cryptosporidiosis, white muscle disease, and enterotoxemia, start to become important.",

Epidemiologic studies investigating the risk factors for perinatal mortality in dairy calves have identified a number of genetic and nongenetic factors that are consistently associated with perinatal mortality. 4, 7, 11, 12 Dystocia has consistently been identified as the single most important factor associated with perinatal mortality. Reported odds ratios (ORs) vary widely (2.7 to 14.6), but suggest that calves requiring assisted delivery have a 2.7 to 14.6 higher risk of death in the perinatal period than spontaneously born calves. 4 Other factors contributing to perinatal mortality include lactation number (calves born from heifers being more likely to die in the first hours of life than calves from multiparous cows), birth weight (calves with a birth weight of less than 20 kg and over 60 kg being at increased risk), 7 and days of gestation (calves born before 272 days of gestation being 6.7 times more likely to die than calves born between 272 and 302 days of gestation). 7 The OR for the death of a twin calf in the perinatal period was estimated at 13.4 times greater compared with singleton calves. 4 Calving-associated anoxia may be an important contributing factor in these deaths.",

These have proved of value in the management and treatment of prematurity, immaturity, dysmaturity, and neonatal maladjustment syndromes in newborn foals and in enteric and septicemic diseases. Different levels of intensive care have been defined, starting from those that can be applied at the level of the farm and increasing in sophistication, required facilities, and instrumentation to those that are the province of a specialized referral hospital.

It is a failure to grow properly, in contrast to a failure to gain body weight, and occurs when the developmental age is less than the chronologic (gestational) age. Runt is a common colloquial agricultural term. Normal fetal growth rate is determined by genetic and epigenetic factors, and cross-breeding experiments suggest that fetal size is regulated by the embryonic/fetal genotype and also is an effect of maternal genotype. Litter size has an effect on birth weight in all species, most likely through effects on the placental delivery of nutrients and removal of waste products relative to total fetal mass. A genetic association with intrauterine growth retardation has been shown in Japanese Black calves. There is a strong positive association between placental mass and fetal size at birth in all species, and the majority of cases of growth retardation result from inadequate placentation, disturbance in utero of placental blood flow, or placental pathology.",

The degree of growth restriction is directly related to the degree of hyperthermia to which the ewe is exposed and her heat tolerance. The growth retardation affects fetal weight more than fetal length, and although there is some reduction in the growth of the brain, it is relatively less than that of the internal organs, resulting in an increased brain : liver weight ratio at birth.

This has been postulated as a possible cause of the fetal growth retardation that accompanies maternal caloric undernutrition; runt pigs have a reduced metabolic rate and lower skeletal muscle respiratory enzyme activity.

For instance, in 41 11 Among Holsteins, Jerseys, and crossbreds, gestation length was ~275 days, with male calves having a gestation length 1.2 days longer. The percentage of stillbirths was 6.6% across all observations, with 9.6% among first-parity dams and 5.1% among multiparous dams. 12 Traditionally, external signs have been used to predict a premature foaling, and the common signs used are the enlargement of the udder, milk flow, and the occurrence of vaginal discharge. Causes of early foaling include bacterial or fungal placentitis and twin pregnancy. Several assays are used as alternate methods of determining whether foaling is imminent and if problems are present.",

Recognition that significant changes occur in udder secretions during the last week of gestation, including a drop in pH on the day of foaling and increases in concentrations of calcium and potassium and declines in levels of sodium and chloride, has led to the development of several relatively simple tests. 13 These tests include measurement of the refractive index, pH, and calcium concentration of udder secretions during the week before anticipated parturition. Samples can be analyzed for calcium carbonate concentration using a water hardness kit, for pH with pH test paper, and for refractometry index with a Brix or similar refractometer. The positive predictive value (PPV) of parturition occurring within 72 hours and the negative predictive value (NPV) within 24 hours for calcium carbonate concentration (\u2265400 \u00b5g/g) were 94% and 98%, respectively. 14, 15 The PPV within 72 hours and the NPV within 24 hours for the pH test (\u22646.4) were 98% and 99%, respectively.

Radiographs may show incomplete ossification of the carpal and tarsal bones and immaturity of the lung, and there may be clinical evidence of respiratory distress. Full-term foals born after 320 days of gestation but exhibiting signs of prematurity are described as dysmature. Premature foals have hypoadrenal corticalism. They are neutropenic and lymphopenic at birth and have a narrow neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. In premature foals older than 35 hours the neutrophil count can be used to predict survival, and foals that remain neutropenic after this time have a poor prognosis. Premature foals also have low plasma glucose, low plasma cortisol, and a blood pH of less than 7.25. An extensive collaborative investigation of equine prematurity has been conducted, and information on foal metabolism and guidelines for laboratory and clinical assessment of maturity are available. 2 Foals that are born with clinical abnormalities suggestive of intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, or dysmaturity are more likely to have an abnormal placenta and have higher serum concentrations of creatinine. 3 The placenta is critical to the fetus in the antenatal period, and pregnancies involving placental lesions commonly result in foals that suffer premature-like signs at whatever stage they are delivered. 3, 4 Placental edema, placental villous atrophy, and premature separation of the placenta are significant causes of fetal ill-health and delayed development. 5 Precocious lactation of the mare can be associated with placentitis. The examination of the placenta for evidence of placentitis and for the presence of larger-than-normal avillous areas should be part of normal foaling management. There is a high correlation between both allantochorionic weight and area and foal weight in normal placentas. Normal placentas had a low association with subsequent perinatal disease in the foals. 3, 4 In contrast, abnormal placental histology was associated with poor foal outcome (three normal foals from 32 abnormal placentas). Edema, sacculation, and strangulation are other abnormalities and can be associated with microscopic deposits of minerals within the lumen of placental blood vessels.",

Neonates that suffer birth trauma and anoxia but survive are at risk for development of signs of neurologic disease, have reduced vigor, are slower to suck, and are at increased risk for postnatal mortality. 1 In all species, but in ruminants in particular, the condition of the dam can have a marked influence on the prevalence of birth injury and its consequences. The effect is well illustrated in sheep, where the two extremes of condition can cause problems. Ewes on a high plane of nutrition produce a large fetus and also deposit fat in the pelvic girdle, which constricts the birth canal, predisposing to dystocia. Conversely, thin ewes may be too weak to give birth rapidly. Pelvic size can influence the risk of birth injury, and ewe lambs and heifers mated before they reach 65% of mature weight are at risk. Pelvimetry is used to select heifers with adequate pelvic size for breeding, but the accuracy and validity of this method are seriously questioned. Breed is also a determinant of length and ease of labor and the subsequent quickness to time to first suckle.",

Incompatibility in the sizes of the fetus and the dam's pelvis is the single most important cause of dystocia, and birth weight is the most important contributing factor. In cattle, expected progeny difference (EPD) estimates for calf birth weight are good predictors of calving ease. In foals, calves, and lambs the chest is most vulnerable to traumatic injury, but there is the chance of vertebral fracture and physical trauma to limbs with excessive external traction. 2 Fractured ribs are common in foals and can lead to laceration of the lungs and heart and internal hemorrhage. 3 Rupture of the liver is common in some breeds of sheep and can also occur in calves and foals. A retrospective study of rib and vertebral fractures in calves suggests that most result from excessive traction and that, as a result, smaller dystocial calves are more at risk. Vertebral fractures occur as the result of traction in calves with posterior presentations and in calves with hip lock. Trauma is a major cause of neonatal mortality in piglets, but it occurs in the postparturient phase and is associated with being overlain or stepped on by the sow.

Blood flow in umbilical vessels is reduced during uterine contractions and ceases during stage 2 labor in cattle as the calf 's head appears at the vulva and just before delivery of the calf. 1 Before this stage, blood flow in the umbilical vein is significantly lower in acidotic than in nonacidotic calves, indicating impairment of oxygen delivery to the fetus and development of increased blood lactate concentrations. 1 Fetal capillary blood pH and oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions can be measured during parturition, as is common practice in human obstetrics. 3 Fetal blood is collected from capillaries in the front feet as they project from the vulva by making a small incision (nick) in the skin and collecting blood into a capillary tube, which is then sealed before blood-gas analysis. 3 In 38 calves, some of which were born as a result of relieved dystocia or cesarean section, fetal capillary blood-gas values and pH (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) during the final 30 minutes of stage 2 labor were as follows: pH = 7.30 \u00b1 0.10 (min 6.99, max 7.43), Po 2 = 19.5 \u00b1 9.4 mm Hg, Pco 2 = 55.9 \u00b1 26.0 mm Hg, HCO 3 \u2212 = 26.0 \u00b1 4.4 mm Hg, base excess = \u22120.9 \u00b1 5.3 mM/L, and oxygen saturation = 21.9 \u00b1 16.6. 3 These compare with the following values in capillary blood obtained after recovery from birth in healthy calves: pH = 7.37 \u00b1 0.11, Po 2 = 58.4 \u00b1 17.0 mm Hg, Pco 2 = 38.1 \u00b1 13.2 mm Hg, HCO 3 \u2212 = 20.8 \u00b1 4.9 mm Hg, base excess = \u22123.2 \u00b1 4.4 mM/L, and oxygen saturation = 82.4 \u00b1 14.9%. 3 Similarly, jugular vein blood collected from 79 lambs immediately after birth (before onset of regular breathing) had the following values: pH = 7.21 \u00b1 0.09 (range, 6.99 to 7.41), Po 2 = 18.4 \u00b1 9.8 mm Hg (4 to 53), Pco 2 = 65.4 \u00b1 12.5 mm Hg (29.6 to 103.7), HCO 3 \u2212 = 26.5 \u00b1 4.0 mm Hg (13.9 to 35.4), base excess = \u22121.3 \u00b1 5.1 mM/L (\u221216 to 9), and oxygen saturation = 21.2 \u00b1 16.6% (0 to 85). 4 Both normal calves and lambs are acidotic, hypoxemic, and hypercapnic during birth as a result of impaired placental blood flow, and prolonged duration of stage 2 of parturition likely exacerbates this hypoxia and increases morbidity and fatality rate. 1 A similar syndrome has been produced experimentally by clamping the umbilical cord of the bovine fetus in utero for 6 to 8 minutes, followed by a cesarean section 30 to 40 minutes later. Calves born following this procedure may die within 10 to 15 minutes after birth or survive for up to 2 days. During the experimental clamping of the umbilical cord, there is a decline in the blood pH, Po 2 , and standard bicarbonate levels and an increase in Pco 2 and lactate levels. There is also increased fetal movement during clamping and a release of meconium, which stains the calf and the amniotic fluid. Those that survive for a few hours or days are dull and depressed, cannot stand, and have poor sucking and swallowing reflexes, and their temperature is usually subnormal. They respond poorly to supportive therapy. A slight body tremor may be present, and occasionally tetany and opisthotonus occur before death. Calves that are barely able to stand cannot find the teats of the dam because of uncontrolled head movements. At necropsy of these experimental cases, there are petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages on the myocardium and endocardium, there is an excess of pericardial fluid, and the lungs are inflated. When the experimental clamping lasts only 4 minutes, the calves usually survive.",

Birth-injured lambs, usually large single-born lambs, have depressed sucking and feeding activity, and actions to increase the birth weight of lambs above a certain point are likely to be counterproductive. 4 The relationship between mortality of lambs and birth weight is a U-shaped curve, with smaller and larger lambs at increased risk of death. 2 In lambs that have hypothermia associated with heat loss in excess of summit metabolism, heat is required for therapy, but in lambs with starvation hypothermia the administration of glucose is also necessary. Glucose is administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight using a 20% solution. Following the administration of the glucose, the lambs should be dried with a towel if wet and rewarmed in air at 40\u00b0 C (104\u00b0 F). This can be done in a warming box using a radiant heater as the heat supply. Care should be taken to avoid hyperthermia. Careful attention must be given to the nutrition of the lambs after rewarming; otherwise, relapse of hypothermia will occur.

Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon in mammals in which the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns to the fetus.

For these genes, expression is restricted to one of the two parentally inherited chromosomes. Imprinted chromosomes are silenced, allowing the other chromosome to be expressed, which is referred to as maternally expressed/ paternally imprinted or paternally expressed/ maternally imprinted. 1 Although the number of genes that can imprint is limited, many of these genes encode for proteins that regulate a wide variety of biological processes, including embryonic and neonatal growth, metabolism, and behavior. 1 Understanding of this process has followed observations on abnormalities in animals born as a result of assisted reproductive technologies (including in vitro fertilization and somatic-cell nuclear transfer cloning) that alter methylation of chromosomes in gametes. 1, 11 (See \"Disorders of Cloned Offspring, \" page 1870).",

This has been demonstrated for sheep in the Lifetime Wool project, in which numerous studies have revealed the importance of providing optimal nutrition and body condition for ewes for both the ewes' productivity and the lifetime productivity of their lambs. 13, 14 The body weight profile of Merino ewes determines the fleece weight and fiber diameter of their progeny, with an optimal weight profile of the ewe resulting in higher fleece weight and finer wool in the progeny. 8 It does not appear that nutrition of the ewe affects milk production by her daughter and, therefore, live weight at weaning of the ewe's daughter's progeny. 15 There is interest in fetal programming and epigenetics for horses, but currently there are no practical implications, although these can be anticipated. 3, 4 Effects on both the dam and the fetus can occur from overfeeding or underfeeding of the dam, 9 and there can be effects from the influences of trace-element deficiencies or toxic substances. Severe undernutrition of the dam can affect fetal size and its thermogenic rate, with consequences as described earlier. Prepartum protein restriction has the greatest effect. Severe undernutrition of the dam can also lead to weak labor and increased rates of dystocia and can limit the development of the udder.

This has been postulated as a possible cause of the fetal growth retardation that accompanies maternal caloric undernutrition. Runt pigs have a reduced metabolic rate and lower skeletal muscle respiratory enzyme activity. This deficiency persists after birth; runt pigs have a lower core temperature and a lessened ability to increase their metabolic rate and heat production in response to cold. Paradoxically, overnourishing the adolescent ewe will also result in placental growth restriction and in utero growth retardation. This effect is most evident in the second third of pregnancy. This syndrome is accompanied by the birth of lambs with a shorter gestational age, commonly reduced by 3 days.

Of particular significance is the agalactia, prolonged gestation, and fetal distress at birth seen in mares fed grain contaminated with ergot (Claviceps purpurea) and in mares grazing tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) containing the endophyte fungus Acremonium coenophialum. Kenyon Any examination of neonatal mortality suspected of being caused by hypothermia, starvation, or infection as a result of failure of transfer of passive immunity, and even trauma by crushing in piglets, must take into account the possibility that poor mothering and a poor mother-young bond could be the primary cause. Inadequate maternal care leads to rapid death of the newborn under extensive conditions where there is no human intervention to correct the problem. 1 The defect is most likely to be on the side of the dam, but it may originate with the offspring, especially in those that are hypothermic. 2 A poor relationship may be genetic or nutritional, and, on the part of the offspring, it may be the result of birth trauma. For both the dam and the young, there is a much greater chance of establishing a good bond if the animal has been reared in a group rather than as an individual. Because sight, smell, taste, and hearing are all important in the establishment of seeking and posturing to suckle activity by the dam and seeking, nuzzling, and sucking activity by the offspring, any husbandry factor that interferes with the use of these senses predisposes to mortality. Weakness of the offspring as a result of poor nutrition of the dam, harassment at parturition by overzealous attendants, and high growth of pasture are obvious examples. Poor mother-young relationship can be a problem in cattle, pigs, and sheep, and occasionally in horses, especially with extensive foaling practices. In pigs a poor mother-young relationship may be developed to an intense degree in the form of farrowing hysteria, which is dealt with under that heading. In sheep a poor mother-young relationship can be a significant contributor to neonatal death from starvation, especially in highly strung breeds such as the Merino, which have a higher mismothering rate than do Romney ewes. 2, 3 Bonding occurs rapidly after birth, although there is some minor variation between species, with bonding starting within a few minutes of birth in sheep but taking up to 2 to 3 hours in some horses, for example. The strength of bonding also appears to vary between species. The bonding of the dam to the neonate is usually quite specific, although this can be modulated by management systems, and the neonate may be less selective and will often attempt to suck other dams. With sheep lambed under intensive lambing practices, this can lead to high rates of mismothering and subsequent abandonment, when preparturient \"robber\" ewes adopt lambs from multiple births. A high degree of shepherding is required to minimize loss in these management systems, whereas in extensive systems a strong bonding is established if the ewe and lamb are allowed to remain relatively undisturbed on the lambing site for 6 hours. A scoring system is available to allow objective assessment of the vigor of newborn lambs (Tables  19-1 ",

Adequate antibody transfer is the cornerstone of all neonatal preventive health programs, but FTPI remains an important problem particularly affecting the dairy industry.

Values are given as guidelines. FTPI in calves has been defined as a serum IgG concentration below 1000 mg/dL (10 mg/mL) when measured between 24 hours and 7 days of age. With foals, the equivalent IgG cutoff concentrations for FTPI and partial FTPI are given as 400 mg/dL and 800 mg/dL, respectively. Although a serum IgG concentration above 400 mg/dL might be adequate for healthy foals kept in a clean environment with minimal pathogen exposure, a concentration above 800 mg/dL is considered optimal. 6 For New World camelid crias, a cut-point value for the serum IgG concentration of 1000 mg/dL measured at around 36 hours of life has been recommended. 7 Rates of FTPI in dairy calves can vary widely between farms, but they were estimated to be in the range of 20% in a recent nationwide survey conducted in the United States. 1 In beef calves FTPI rates tend to be lower; a recent Canadian study reported the incidence of FTPI, defined as serum IgG concentrations below 800 mg/dL, of 6% and a rate of marginal transfer of passive immunity (800 mg/dL < IgG < 1600 mg/dL) of 10%. 8 Failure rates in foals reported in the literature are approximate 13% to 16%. Rates in lambs are also comparatively low, and the incidence of FTPI in crias has been estimated to be around 10%. 7 In animals that are fed colostrum artificially, risk for FTPI is primarily dependent on the amount or mass of immunoglobulin present in a feeding of colostrum, the time after birth that this is fed, the efficiency of its absorption from the digestive tract, and possibly also the degree of bacterial contamination. 1 The mass of immunoglobulins fed is determined by the concentration of immunoglobulin in the colostrum and the volume that is fed. Feeding trials with calves suggest that a mass of at least 150 g of IgG is required in colostrum fed to a 45-kg calf to obtain adequate (\u22651000 mg/dL IgG) colostral immunoglobulin concentrations in serum.",

However, colostrum from all lactation numbers can produce adequate immunoglobulin mass. There is no scientific basis for not feeding first-milking colostrum from firstlactation cows. \u2022 Larger-volume first-milking colostrum tends to have lower immunoglobulin concentrations than smaller-volume colostrum, presumably as a result of dilution. \u2022 Immunoglobulin concentrations were found to be higher in the early temporal fractions of a single milking of firstmilking colostrum. This might suggest that segregation of the first portion of the first-milking colostrum could provide colostrum with higher immunoglobulin concentration for feeding. \u2022 There are breed differences in the concentration of immunoglobulins in first-milking colostrum. In cattle, beef breeds have higher concentrations. Many dairy breeds, including Holstein Friesian, produce colostrum of relatively low immunoglobulin concentration, and a significant proportion of calves that suckle cows of these breeds ingest an inadequate mass of immunoglobulin. Channel Island breeds have a greater concentration of immunoglobulin in colostrum that Holstein Friesians. Breed differences are also seen in horses, with Arabian mares having higher colostral immunoglobulin concentrations than Standardbreds, which in turn are higher than those of Thoroughbreds. Breed differences also occur in sheep, with higher concentrations in meat and wool breeds than dairy breeds. \u2022 Heat stress to cattle in the latter part of pregnancy results in lower colostral immunoglobulin concentrations. \u2022 Colostral volume but not colostral immunoglobulin concentration is reduced in mastitic quarters, and it is unlikely that mastitis is a major determinant of the high rate of FTPI in dairy calves.

If pools are used, the diluting influence of low-immunoglobulin-concentration, high-volume colostrum should be limited by restricting any individual cow's contribution to the pool to 9 kg (20 lb) or less.

The average volume of colostrum ingested by nursing Holstein Friesian calves in the first 24 hours of life is reported as 2.4 L, but there is wide variation around this mean. In natural suckling situations, calves may fail to ingest adequate colostrum volumes before onset of the closure process and therefore absorb insufficient colostral immunoglobulin. Early assisted suckling may help avoid this. In dairy calves the volume of colostrum that is ingested can be controlled in artificial feeding systems using nipple bottle feeders or esophageal tube feeders. Bucket feeding of colostrum is not recommended because training to feed from a bucket can be associated with erratic intakes. The traditional recommendation for the volume of colostrum to feed at first feeding to calves is 2 L (2 quarts). However, only a small proportion of first-milking colostrum from Holsteins contains a sufficiently high concentration of immunoglobulin to provide 100 g IgG in a 2-L volume, and higher volumes of colostrum are required to achieve this mass intake. Some calves fed with a nipple bottle will drink volumes greater than 2 L, but others will refuse to ingest even 2 L of colostrum in a reasonable period of time, and calf rearers may lack the time or patience to persist with nipple bottle feeding until the required volume has been ingested by all calves.",

Asphyxia has a major effect on subsequent sucking drive, and acidemic calves ingest far less colostrum than calves with more normal acid-base status at birth. In carefully controlled colostrum feeding studies, a significant negative correlation between the degree of hypercapnia and the efficiency of absorption of colostral immunoglobulin in the first hours of life was demonstrated. However, this effect was only transient because there was no difference in serum IgG concentration at the time of gut closure between normoxic and hypoxic calves. \u2022 In one early study, a mothering effect was reported in which calves remaining with their dams absorbed colostral immunoglobulin more efficiently than calves removed immediately to individual pens. However, other studies have shown much smaller or no effects of mothering using similar experimental designs. The different results of these studies have not been reconciled. \u2022 There can be seasonal and geographic variations in transfer of immunoglobulin in calves, although these are not always present on farms in the same area, and their cause is unknown. Where seasonal variation occurs in temperate climates, the mean monthly serum IgG concentrations are lowest in the winter and increase during the spring and early summer to reach their peak in September, after which they decrease. The cause is not known, but a decrease in sucking drive is observed in colder months and may contribute. In subtropical climates, peak levels occur in the winter months, and low levels are associated with elevated temperatures during the summer months. Heat stress in late pregnancy will reduce colostral immunoglobulin concentration, but high ambient temperature is a strong depressant of absorption, and the provision of shade will help to obviate the problem. \u2022 The efficiency of absorption may be decreased in premature calves that are born following induced parturition using long-acting corticosteroids; in contrast, medical induction of parturition with short-acting corticosteroids in cattle does not interfere with the efficiency of absorption of immunoglobulins in calves. \u2022 The absorption of small volumes (1 to 2 L) fed by an esophageal feeder is usually suboptimal and inferior to the absorption after sucking the same small volume. 10 This effect may at least in part be attributable to retention of some colostrum in the immature forestomaches for several hours. The calf will feel satiated and not inclined to suck naturally for the next few hours. \u2022 A trypsin inhibitor in colostrum may serve to protect colostral IgG from intestinal degradation. It varies in concentration between colostrums. The addition of a trypsin inhibitor to colostrum improves immunoglobulin absorption. \u2022 In a study of mare-associated determinants of FTPI in foals (based on serum Ig measurements), there was a trend to increase rates of FTPI in foals from mares aged over 12 years, but no significant association with age, parity, or gestational age of foals over 325 days was found. There was an association with season, with a lower incidence in the late spring compared with foals born earlier in the year and with a foal score based on a veterinary score of foal health and \"fitness. \" Traditionally it has been considered that the movement of animals, either the dam just before parturition or the newborn animal during the first few days of life, is a special hazard for the health of the calf. The postulated reason is that the dam may not have been exposed to pathogens present in the new environment and thus not have circulating antibodies against these pathogens. The newborn animal may be in the same position with regard to both deficiency of antibodies and exposure to new infections. Although this may be the case in some situations, the developing practice of contract-rearing of dairy heifers away from the farm to be brought back as close-up springers and the practice of purchase of close-up heifers on the farm are not associated with appreciable increase in mortality in their calves.",

A Brix refractometer value of 21% or 22% or higher indicates acceptable colostrum (same value for fresh or frozen samples; approximately equivalent to a colostral IgG concentration of 50 g/L); colostrum with a value below 21% or 22% should be discarded. 17, 18 Specific Gravity Specific gravity, determined by refractometry, can be used as a measure of the immunoglobulin content of colostrum. In mares the concentration of immunoglobulin in colostrum is highly correlated with the specific gravity of the colostrum, which in turn is highly correlated with the serum immunoglobulin levels achieved in foals. Temperature-corrected measurements are most accurate. Measurement of colostrum specific gravity provides a rapid and easy method of identifying foals likely to be at a high risk for FTPI and the need to provide them with colostrum of a higher Ig content. To prevent FTPI, it is recommended that the colostral specific gravity should be equal to or greater than 1.060, and the colostral IgG concentration should be a minimum of 3000 mg/dL.",

This problem can be alleviated to some extent by assisted natural sucking, but this can fail because not all calves requiring assistance are detected. An alternate approach is to milk 2 L of colostrum from the dam, bottle feed each calf as soon after birth as possible, then leave the calf with the cow for 24 hours and allow it to suck voluntarily. Although this will not be as effective as a system based entirely on artificial feeding of selected colostrum, it is an approach that is suitable for the smaller dairy farm.",

The first feeding is usually milked from the cow by hand, and the remaining feedings are from the colostrum obtained from the cow after the first machine milking. With care and patience, this system can result in good transfer of passive immunity in all calves except those born to dams that have very low concentrations of immunoglobulin in their colostrum. Unfortunately, with Holstein Friesians this can be a significant percentage. An extension of this system is to bottle feed at the same frequency but to feed stored colostrum selected for its superior immunoglobulin content. Bottle feeding of newborn calves requires considerable patience, and its success is very much dependent on the calf feeder and on the availability of the feeder's time when faced with a calf that has a slow intake.",

Fever is a specific, but not sensitive, sign of sepsis in foals. The presence of petechia in oral, nasal, ocular, or vaginal mucous membranes, the pinna, or coronary bands is considered a specific indicator of sepsis, although this has not been documented by appropriate studies. A similar comment applies for injection of the scleral vessels. A scoring system (the sepsis score) has been developed to aid in the identification of foals with sepsis. The sepsis score was developed with the intention of aiding identification of foals with sepsis, thereby facilitating appropriate treatment. A table for calculation of the sepsis score (the modified sepsis score) is provided in Table 19 -11. Foals with a score of 12 or greater are considered to be septic, with a sensitivity of 94% in the original report. However, more recent studies, including one of 1095 foals, have found the sensitivity and specificity of the sepsis score to be less than the original report. The modified sepsis score detected sepsis with a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 73% using a cutoff value of 11 or more. A cutoff value of 7 yielded a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 42%. 3 These recent studies are broadly consistent with earlier studies that demonstrate that the sepsis score has limited sensitivity (67%, 95% CI 59% to 75%) and specificity (76%, 95% CI 68% to 83%) in foals less than 10 days of age. Similarly, 49% of 101 foals with positive blood cultures had a sepsis score of 11 or less, indicating a low specificity of the test. The low to moderate sensitivity of the sepsis score for detection of sepsis or bacteremia means that many foals with sepsis are incorrectly diagnosed as being nonseptic (i.e., a high false-negative rate), whereas a moderate to low specificity means that the falsepositive rate might be excessive, with a number of foals being considered septic when they are not. This is an important shortcoming of the test because accurate and prompt identification of foals with sepsis is assumed to be important for both prognostication and selection of treatment. The sepsis score might be useful in some situations, but its shortcomings should be recognized when using it to guide treatment or determine prognosis.",

            "text": "Detection of prematurity is important because it is a strong risk factor for development of other diseases during the immediate postpartum period. The detection of prematurity is often based on the length of gestation. However, the duration of gestation in Thoroughbred horses varies considerably, with 95% of mares foaling after a gestation of 327 to 357 days. The generally accepted \"average\" gestation is 349 days, with fillies having shorter gestations than do colts (348 versus 350 days) and gestation length declining by approximately 20 days, from 360 to 340 days, in Standardbred mares in New Zealand. 4 Ponies have a shorter gestation (333 days, range 315 to 350 days). Therefore a diagnosis of prematurity should be based not just on gestational age but also on the results of physical, hematologic, and serum biochemical examination of the newborn. Factors helping in the determination of prematurity are listed in Table 19 -4. Foals that are immature (premature) at birth typically have low birth weight and small body size, a short and silky hair coat, and laxity of the flexor and extensor tendons. The cranium is rounded, and the pinnae lack tone (droopy ears). The foals are typically weak and have trouble standing, which is exacerbated by laxity of the flexor tendons and periarticular ligaments. Dysmature (postmature) foals are typically large, although they can be thin, and have a long hair coat and flexure tendon contracture. These signs are consistent with prolonged gestation combined with inadequate intrauterine nutrition. Healthy foals stand approximately 65 min (interquartile range, 45 to 100 minutes) after birth. 4 Examination of the placenta, either by ultrasonographic examination before birth or by direct examination, including histologic and microbiologic testing, after birth is useful in identifying abnormalities that have significance for the newborn.",

A variety of tests are available for rapid detection of FTPI in foals and calves. Although measurement of serum IgG concentration is ideally performed by the gold standard test, a radial immunodiffusion, this test requires at least 24 hours to run, whereas the stall-side or chemistry analyzer tests can be run in a few minutes. The sensitivity and specificity have been determined for a number of these rapid tests. Overall, most tests have high sensitivity (>80%), meaning that the few foals that have low concentrations of IgG are missed, but poor specificity (50% to 70%), meaning that many foals that have adequate concentrations of immunoglobulin are diagnosed as having inadequate concentrations. The exact sensitivity and specificity depend on the test used and the concentration of immunoglobulin considered adequate. The high sensitivity and low specificity of most of the available rapid tests result in a number of foals that do not need a transfusion receiving one. However, this error is of less importance than that of foals that should receive a transfusion not receiving one.",

The oldest age at which measurement of serum IgG is useful in foals is uncertain, but depends on the clinical condition of the foal.

Foals need approximately 2 g of IgG per kilogram of body weight to achieve a plasma concentration of 2000 mg/ dL (20g/L); therefore a 45-kg foal needs approximately 90 g of IgG to attain a normal serum IgG concentration (or approximately 40 g to achieve a serum IgG concentration of 800 mg/dL [8 g/L]). Assuming that colostrum contains on average 10,000 mg/ dL (100 g/L), foals must ingest at least 1 L of colostrum to obtain sufficient immunoglobulin. Because colostral IgG concentration varies considerably (from 2000 to 30,000 mg/ dL), specific recommendations regarding the quantity of colostrum to be fed to neonatal foals cannot be made with certainty. However, colostrum with a specific gravity of more than 1.060 has an IgG concentration of more than 3000 mg/dL (30 g/L), suggesting that foals should ingest at least 1.5 L to achieve serum IgG concentrations above 800 mg/dL (8 g/L).",

            "text": "There is some debate as to what constitutes a critical serum or plasma IgG concentration. Foals that ingest an adequate amount of colostrum typically have serum immunoglobulin concentrations during the first week of life greater than approximately 2000 mg/dL (20 g/L). Both 400 mg/dL (4 g/L) and 800 mg/dL (8 g/L) have been recommended as concentrations below which foals should be considered to have increased likelihood of contracting infectious disease, but recent evidence strongly supports the use of 800 mg/dL (8 g/L) as the minimal concentration in hospitalized foals. However, on a well-managed farm the serum IgG concentration was not predictive of morbidity or mortality among foals, suggesting that serum immunoglobulin concentration in some populations of foals is not an important risk factor for infectious disease. The foals in this study were from an exceptionally well-managed farm. Other researchers have found that foals with serum IgG concentration below 800 mg/dL (8 g/L) are at markedly increased risk of subsequent development of infectious disease, including sepsis, pneumonia, and septic arthritis. It is likely that there is no single concentration of IgG in serum that is protective in all situations, and the concentration of IgG in serum that is desirable in an individual foal depends on the risk factors for infectious disease of that foal. Our opinion is that a minimum serum IgG in foals free of disease and housed in closed bands on well-managed farms is 400 mg/dL (4 g/L). For foals at increased risk of disease-for instance, those on large farms with frequent introduction of animals and foals that are transported or housed with foals with infectious disease-the minimum advisable serum IgG concentration is 800 mg/dL (8 g/L). Foals that have infectious disease should have serum IgG concentrations of at least 800 mg/dL, and it might be advantageous for these foals to have even higher values, as indicated by the enhanced survival of foals with septic disease administered equine plasma regardless of their serum IgG concentration. This therapeutic advantage could be because of the additional IgG or because of other factors included in the plasma. Transfusion of plasma to sick foals improves neutrophil function, an important advantage given that oxidative burst activity of neutrophils from septic foals is reduced compared with that in healthy foals.",

Consequently, by the time that FTPI is recognized, it is no longer feasible to increase serum IgG concentrations by feeding colostrum or oral serum products. Foals should then be administered plasma or serum intravenously. The amount of plasma or serum to be administered depends on the target value for serum IgG concentration and the initial serum IgG concentration in the foal. For each gram of IgG administered per kilogram of body weight of the foal, serum IgG concentration increases by approximately 8.7 mg/dL (0.87 g/L) in healthy foals and 6.2 mg/dL (0.62 g/L) in sick foals. To achieve serum IgG concentrations above 800 mg/dL (8 g/L) in foals with serum IgG concentrations below 400 mg/dL (4 g/L), they should be administered 40 mL/ kg of plasma containing at least 20 g/L of IgG.

Goodquality commercial products specify the minimum concentration of IgG in the plasma. Concentrated serum products that do not need to be frozen until use are available.

There is a consensus that the recovery rate for severely ill foals has improved over the last decade because of provision of better care. There are reports of survival rates of around 80% for foals treated at a specialized intensive care unit. However, the high cost of providing care for these animals has prompted studies to determine outcome, as a means of deciding whether, financially, treatment is warranted. Surviving Thoroughbred foals do not differ from siblings with regard to percentage of starters, percentage of winners, or number of starts, but surviving foals achieve significantly fewer wins and total earnings. 25 The increased number of foals being treated intensively has resulted in prospective studies of outcome. The prognosis for athletic activity for foals with septic arthritis is poor. Thoroughbred foals with septic arthritis have odds of 0.28 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.62; roughly one-quarter of the likelihood) for racing compared with a cohort of healthy foals. Multisystemic disease, in addition to the presence of septic arthritis, decreased the likelihood of racing to one-tenth that of healthy foals (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.90). Affected foals that survive take almost 40% longer to race for the first time. Approximately 30% to 48% of affected Thoroughbred foals eventually race, compared with approximately 65% of normal foals.",

In some herds, sporadic abortions occurred before calving season of the herd began. In some cases, affected calves died within minutes after being born with varying degrees of obstetric assistance. In calves that survived for a few days, clinical findings included lassitude, depression, weakness, variable body temperature, a reddened and crusty muzzle, lameness, reluctance to stand, enlargement of the carpal and tarsal joint capsules along with periarticular subcutaneous swellings, and a hunched-up back if they stood. Diarrhea occurred in some calves after a few days of illness, but it was not a major clinical finding. Treatment was ineffective, and the case fatality rates ranged from 60% to 80%.",

At necropsy there are no obvious or only few lesions to account for the illness. Calves that are weak after birth because of traumatic injuries associated with dystocia or other significant lesions can be accounted for according to the nature and severity of the lesions. Reports from Northern Ireland in recent years indicate that in dairy herds the incidence of weak-calf syndrome has ranged from 10% to 20% of all calves born. Field observations in problem herds found that the gestation period is of normal duration, but parturition is usually prolonged, with the first and second stages of labor lasting 24 hours. Affected calves usually are born alive but are unable to sustain breathing following birth. Despite resuscitation efforts, they commonly die within 10 minutes, often accompanied by prominent uncoordinated movements of the limbs. Some calves are stillborn, and whether or not this is a variation of the syndrome is uncertain. In a report from the United Kingdom, the syndrome occurred in calves born from heifers and was characterized by failure to breathe at birth or breathing with difficulty, and/or failing to move after birth, and failure to suck.

The syndrome may occur in calves of any birth weight. The incidence has been highest in purebred Brahman females, but it has also occurred in Aberdeen Angus, Hereford, Chianina, and Brown Swiss breeds of cattle. Field observations indicate that affected calves did not stand for up to 1 to 2 hours after birth to initiate teat-seeking behavior. Dummy calves appear to lack the sensitivity to teat-seek, and if they fail to locate a teat by about 4 to 5 hours after birth, they commonly lose the sucking reflex and then require intensive nursing care by bottle feeding to initiate sucking. In calves that fail to suck and ingest colostrum, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and neonatal infections are common complications. Concurrently, the dam loses interest in the calf and may abandon it.",

            "text": "The successful cloning of domestic animals using somatic-cell nuclear transfer has resulted in birth of offspring with a high frequency of clinical abnormalities. Cloning of livestock and horses is achieved by transfer of nuclear material from the cell of an adult animal to the enucleated egg of an animal of the same species (somatic-cell nuclear transfer), with subsequent implantation of the resulting embryo in a surrogate dam and birth of a live, viable offspring. However, the use of nuclear material from somatic cells of adult animals, and from fetal cells, frequently does not result in normal development of the embryo and placenta. The abnormal development in cloned embryos is a consequence of altered methylation of the genome in transferred nuclear material. This applies particularly for imprinted genes, which are those genes for which only one copy is expressed in the embryo, compared with nonimprinted genes for which both parental copies of the gene are expressed. The lower frequency of expression of imprinted genes (i.e., only one copy, paternal or maternal) is a result of methylation of DNA or chromatin proteins that makes the DNA inaccessible for transcription. 1 Imprinting is a form of epigenetic control of gene expression. To date, 132 imprinted genes have been identified in mice, but only 25, 21, and 14 in cattle, pigs, and sheep, respectively. 1 Imprinted genes encode proteins involved in regulation of many cell processes, including embryonic and neonatal growth and development. 1, 2 In normal reproduction, the paternal genome is demethylated during passage through the oocyte and fusion with the maternal genome. Consequently, the methylation marks of the two genomes (paternal and maternal) are different at the end of the cleavage process. Transfer of somatic nuclear material into an enucleated oocyte results in exposure of both genomes to the active demethylating process in the cytoplasm of the oocyte and uniform or variable demethylation of both genomes. The loss of these parent-specific epigenetic markers results in widespread dysregulation of imprinted genes and subsequent abnormalities in the placenta, fetus, and newborn. Imprinting marks (methylation) are erased during early development, and reprogramming of somatic-cell nuclei used in cloning and these abnormalities in epigenetic control of expression of imprinted genes result in biallelic expression of imprinted genes. 3 The loss of epigenetic control of imprinted genes causes at least some of the abnormalities common in cloned ruminants, including large-offspring syndrome (LOS). 3 A small proportion of transferred blastocysts develop in viable animals.

Abnormalities in the placenta and newborn cloned animals are reported for cattle and sheep, but are less frequently reported, if at all, for pigs and equids (horses and mules). Factors influencing the risks of abnormalities in newborns include the source of the nuclear material, type of in vitro culture media, coculture with somatic cells, hormonal treatments, and manipulation of the embryo. 1, 4 The frequency of birth of live animals born after somatic-cell nuclear transfer from welldifferentiated tissue (e.g., fibroblasts) or fetal somatic cells is lower than after nuclear transfer from embryonic cells (7%, 15%, and 34%, respectively). The cause of placental, fetal, and neonatal abnormalities is abnormal expression of imprinted genes as a consequence of transfer of nuclear material from differentiated somatic cells, 5 conditions and media used for maintenance and culture of cytoplasts and blastocysts, and techniques used for handling cells. 3, [6] [7] [8] The key abnormality is loss of methylation of imprinted genes contributed by each parent, with subsequent biallelic expression of these genes. There is debate about which epigenetic or genetic abnormalities underlay the development of placental and fetal abnormalities. Aberrant hypomethylation of IGF-2 and CDKC1C genes has been identified in calves with LOS and results in biallelic expression in the liver and placenta of affected animals. 1 Abnormalities in embryologic development of vasculature is identifiable early during embryogenesis in calves and might be the defect underlying pulmonary, circulatory, and umbilical abnormalities in cloned calves. 9 Furthermore, there is decreased expression of genes in the lungs of cloned goats that do not survive compared with those of healthy kids. Compared with normal goats of the same age from conventional reproduction, expression of 13 genes (BMP4, FGF10, GHR, HGFR, PDGFR, RABP, VEGF, H19, CDKNIC, PCAF, MeCP2, HDAC1, and Dnmt3b) decreased in transgenic cloned goats that died at or shortly after birth. 6 Expression of eight genes (FGF10, PDGFR, RABP, VEGF, PCAF, HDAC1, MeCP2, and Dnmt3b) decreased in fetal death of transgenic cloned goats. 6 A comprehensive list of genes known to be involved in embryogenesis and fetal and placental growth and a description of the effect of decreased expression of these genes are available. 10 Clinical findings in cloned calves and lambs include abortion, placental abnormalities, large birth size, poor extrauterine viability, respiratory disease, cardiovascular abnormalities, and neurologic disease compatible with neonatal encephalopathy. LOS is confined to ruminants and is characterized by overgrowth, evident as abnormally high birth weight, enlarged tongue, umbilical hernias, and hyporglycemia. 3 Abortion occurs after day 90 of gestation in 30% to 50% of pregnancies in cattle, resulting from transfer blastocysts containing transferred nuclear material. Abnormalities, including hydroallantois, are present in approximately 25% of advanced pregnancies. Placental abnormalities include hydroallantois, a reduction in the number of placentomes (from a normal value of approximately 100 to as few as 26 to 70 in cloned calves), abnormally large placentomes (140 g in cloned calves versus 33 g in conventional calves), and edema of the placenta. 10 Maternal retention of the placenta is common and occurs in most cows. Duration of gestation is probably longer in cloned calves, although the frequent delivery of cloned calves by cesarean section makes assessment of gestational duration difficult. Cloned calves are heavier than conventional calves, often by as much as 25%, a well-recognized part of the largeoffspring syndrome that affects calves born as a result of reproductive manipulation, including in vitro fertilization. Viability of cloned calves that are born alive (commonly by cesarean section) is less than that of conventional calves; only approximately twothirds of cloned calves born alive survive more than 1 month, although others have reported better survival. Similar results are reported for horses.",

Fetal or perinatal hypoxia has achieved some prominence as a cause of neonatal maladjustment syndrome in the absence of consistent demonstration of lesions of hypoxia on histopathologic examination of foals. There are isolated cases in which histologic evidence of hypoxia exists, but these are the exception rather than the rule. Finally, most foals with neonatal maladjustment syndrome improve rapidly and completely recover within several days-a clinical course not expected with neonatal or perinatal asphyxia in other species. Recent evidence implicates a role of neuroactive progestagen derivatives in the etiopathogenesis of neonatal maladjustment syndrome. 5, 6 Plasma concentrations of these neuroactive steroids in foals are high immediately after birth and decline rapidly in healthy foals, but not in foals with neonatal maladjustment syndrome. 5 Foals with neonatal maladjustment syndrome and foals with other illness have higher concentrations of progestagen derivatives than do healthy foals. 5 Plasma concentrations of progestagen derivatives decline in sick foals that do not have neonatal maladjustment syndrome, but not in foals with the syndrome. 5 Progestagen derivatives include progesterone, pregnenolone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and epitestosterone. 5 Evidence from other species and limited experimental evidence in foals indicate that allopregnanolone infusion induces changes in mental status that mimic those seen in foals with neonatal maladjustment syndrome. 6 It is proposed that a subset of foals with signs of neonatal maladjustment syndrome have disease attributable to persistence of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis after birth.",

At birth in healthy foals there is a rapid reduction in concentration of these hormones coincident with increases in activity of the foal. Progestagen derivatives, some of which can cross the blood-brain barrier, modulate the activity of the GABA A receptor and at high concentrations completely inhibit its activity, providing a potential explanation for the somnolence and other signs displayed by foals with neonatal maladjustment syndrome and high plasma progestagen concentrations. 5 Neurologic abnormalities and a failure to nurse result in a failure of the transfer of maternal immunoglobulins, which predisposes the foal to septicemia and hypoglycemia.

Buildup of infection pressure must be minimized by a change to a fresh calving/ lambing area and by the frequent movement of feed bunks or feed areas. Any system that concentrates large numbers of cattle in a small area increases environmental contamination, and close confinement of heifers and cows around calving time is a known risk factor for calf mortality.

Adult cows shedding enteric pathogens are a risk for calf infection. Thus dairy calves are often removed from the dam at birth and placed in individual pens inside or outdoors in hutches and reared in these pens separately from the main herd. This reduces the severity of neonatal diarrhea and pneumonia and risk for mortality compared with calves allowed to remain with the dam. Individual housing in hutches is preferred because this avoids navel sucking and other methods of direct-contact transmission of disease. Humans entering these hutches should also practice interhutch hygiene. The prevalence of disease is higher in enclosed artificially heated barns than in hutches. However, despite the well-established value of individual rearing of calves, animal welfare regulations in several countries require that there be visual and tactile contact between calves. The removal of the cow-calf pair from the main calving grounds to a \"nursery pasture\" after the cow-calf relationship (neonatal bond) is well established, at 2 to 3 days of age, has proved to be a successful management practice in beef herds. This system moves the newborn calf away from the main calving ground, which may be heavily contaminated because of limited space. It necessitates that the producer must plan the location of the calving grounds and nursery pastures well in advance of calving time. Calves that develop diarrhea in the calving grounds or nursery pasture are removed with their dams to a \"hospital pasture\" during treatment and convalescence. The all-in all-out principle of successive population and depopulation of farrowing quarters and calf barns is an effective method of maintaining a low level of contamination pressure for the neonate.",

In a survey of approximately 4400 litters of piglets over a period of 4 years in a large piggery, 64% of the litters were treated for diarrhea before weaning, and piglets born to sows under parity 2 were 1.7 times more likely to develop diarrhea before weaning than litters born to sows over parity 3. The susceptibility or resistance to E. coli diarrhea in piglets has an inherited basis. The cell surface receptor for the F4 (K88) antigen is inherited in a simple mendelian way, with adherence (S) dominant over nonadherence (s). Homozygous dominants (SS) and heterozygotes (Ss) possess the receptor and are susceptible, whereas in the homozygous recessive (ss) the receptor is absent and the pigs are resistant. The highest incidence of diarrhea occurs in susceptible progeny born from resistant dams and sired by susceptible sires. Most if not all pigs have intestinal receptors for F5 (K99 + ) pili and an inheritance pattern similar to F4 (K88) receptors does not exist for F5 receptors.",

However, in calves the maximum efficiency of absorption occurs during the first 6 to 12 hours after birth and decreases rapidly from 12 to 24 hours after birth. Following absorption, transfer to the intestinal lumen is a major means of IgG clearance in calves, and this transfer results in antigen-binding antibody in the intestinal lumen. Both blood-derived antibody and lactogenic antibody are significant sources of passive antibodies in the intestinal lumen of the neonatal calf. Maintenance of high concentrations of milk-derived antibodies in the small intestinal lumen may require more than twice-aday feedings because antibodies derived from a milk diet are predominantly cleared from the intestinal lumen by 12 hours after feeding. Transfer of passively acquired antibodies from the circulation to the small intestinal lumen is therefore a reasonable hypothesis to explain the strong association between high serum passive immunoglobulin concentrations and reduced morbidity in neonatal calves.",

The intestinal permeability to macromolecules in the newborn piglet may predispose to the invasion of septicemiainducing E. coli. These strains are able to invade extraintestinal tissues, to resist the bactericidal effect of complement in blood, to survive and multiply in body fluids, to escape phagocytosis and intracellular killing by phagocytes, and to induce tissue damage by the release of cytotoxins. Calves and piglets that are deficient in colostral immunoglobulins are highly susceptible to septicemia. Colostrum provides protection against colisepticemia, but it may not prevent diarrhea associated with E. coli. Also, colostrumfed calves are much more resistant to endotoxin than colostrum-deprived calves. Calves, piglets, and lambs that have normal levels of serum immunoglobulins are generally protected from septicemia. The clinical findings and lesions in septicemic colibacillosis are attributable to the effects of endotoxin, which causes shock. The general effects of endotoxin in cattle include hypothermia, decreased systemic blood pressure, tachycardia and decreased cardiac output, changes in WBC counts, alterations in blood coagulation, hyperglycemia followed by hypoglycemia, and depletion of liver glycogen. Animals that recover from septicemia may later develop lesions as a result of local infection of other organs at varying periods of time. Arthritis is a common associated finding in calves, foals, and lambs. Meningitis is common in calves and piglets. Polyserositis as a result of E. coli has been recorded in pigs.",

Similar to the expression of F5, production of enterotoxin is pH dependent, with very limited production at an environmental pH below 7.0. 8 Although this does not appear to have been studied specifically, it can be hypothesized that any factor resulting in an increase of the pH in the gut lumen will facilitate the proliferation of the organism; conversely, lowering the pH may reduce the severity of colibacillosis.",

            "text": "Historically, conventional wisdom held that metabolic acidosis in diarrheic calves is the result of fecal bicarbonate loss and formation of L-lactate as a result of increased anaerobic glycolysis in dehydrated animals with decreased tissue perfusion. However, accumulation of L-lactate in neonatal diarrheic calves only appears to occur in calves in their first week of life. Because the relationship between L-lactic acid accumulation and the severity of metabolic acidosis could not be confirmed in clinical cases, it was proposed that exogenous acid supply to the organism must be the major contributor to the so-called anion-gap acidosis typically observed in diarrheic calves. 12 The anion gap, defined as the sum of the major cations minus the sum of the major anions, is a measure of \"unspecified organic and inorganic acids, \" of which lactic acid forms a considerable part. It was not until the end of last century that D-lactic acid accumulation was first identified as a major contributor to elevated anion gaps in diarrheic calves. In the meantime, several studies confirmed that D-lactic but not L-lactic acidosis is a common occurrence in diarrheic calves. Furthermore D-lactic acidosis was identified as a major contributory factor in calves with high anion-gap acidosis. 12 It is currently assumed that D-lactic acidosis is caused by increased intestinal absorption of this compound in diarrheic calves, where malabsorption results in bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates to D-lactate. 12 Recent retrospective studies suggested that the major driving factor of the acidemia of diarrheic calves was an increase in unmeasured anions, of which lactic acid forms a considerable part. The loss of fluid through the intestinal tract with high sodium and low chloride content is likely to contribute to the so-called strong-ion acidosis. The increase of the total plasma protein concentration that is commonly observed with marked dehydration and resulting in a so-called weak-acid acidosis was found to be a minor contributor to acidemia in diarrheic calves. 13 The severity and nature of the acidosis in diarrheic calves vary with the age of the calf. Younger calves tend to dehydrate more rapidly and severely than older calves, which may be related to the greater incidence of enterotoxigenic colibacillosis in the young age group. The severity of dehydration, hypothermia, and acidemia is associated with the level of obtundation. Accordingly, the degree of deterioration of the patient's demeanor in combination with the age of the calf are used to predict the severity of acidemia; the more severe the acidemia, the greater the depression.",

In contrast, experimentally inducing severe hyperchloremic acidosis in calves did not result in noteworthy effects on the demeanor of treated calves. 16, 17 Hyperkalemia in the Diarrheic Calf Hyperkalemia is the most prominent electrolyte disturbance recognized in dehydrated diarrheic calves that are severely acidemic. It occurs despite significant net losses of potassium into the gut in diarrheic animals. A recent retrospective study conducted on patients of a teaching hospital revealed an incidence of hyperkalemia in diarrheic calves of 34%. 18 The predominant clinical finding associated with hyperkalemia is bradycardia and arrhythmia that can lead to atrial standstill, with fatal outcome. Although the association between hyperkalemia and acidemia is well established, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. 19 The long-held mechanism responsible for hyperkalemia in diarrheic calves is directly associated with extracellular acidosis and the electrochemical exchange of K + for H + across the cell membrane, leading to a shift of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space in exchange for H + that tends to shift into the opposite direction with increasing extracellular H + concentrations. Although widely accepted, this proposed mechanism lacks a sound physiochemical basis because a decrease in plasma pH from 7.4 to 7.0 would increase the extracellular H + concentration from 0.000,040 mmol/L to 0.000,100 mmol/L. An equimolar exchange of K + for H + can therefore only account for an increase of the serum potassium concentration of 0.000,06 mmol/L, an effect that not only is not measurable with current laboratory equipment but also is physiologically irrelevant. 19 An alternative mechanism that has been proposed is impaired activity of Na/K-ATPase in states of acidemia, resulting in impaired transport of potassium into the intracellular space. 19 The previously mentioned retrospective study found the occurrence and the degree of hyperkalemia to be more closely associated to the degree of dehydration than to the decrease in venous blood pH or base excess, suggesting that the impaired ability to excrete potassium through the urinary tract may play a more important role than metabolic acidosis/acidemia in the etiology of hyperkalemia in dehydrated calves. 18 Hypernatremia in the Diarrheic Calf Hypernatremia is uncommon in diarrheic calves generally suffering from isotonic or mildly hypotonic dehydration. However, incidental cases of hypernatremia have been reported. It is presumed that mixing errors in the preparation of oral electrolyte solutions to treat diarrhea rather than diarrhea itself is the cause. The experimental oral administration of 1 L of electrolyte concentrate containing 2750 mEq sodium found that calves would willingly consume the solution mixed with milk, and developed signs of hypernatremia within 6 hours of administration.",

Early clinical signs are vague and nonspecific. Affected animals are weak and obtunded, commonly recumbent, and dehydrated; tachycardia is present, and although the temperature may be high initially, it falls rapidly to subnormal levels when the calf becomes weak and moribund. The suck reflex is weak or absent, the oral mucous membranes are dry and cool, and the capillary refill time may be prolonged. Cold extremities, weak peripheral pulse, and prolonged capillary refill time are common. Scleral injection is common. Diarrhea and dysentery may occur but are uncommon.",

Positive blood cultures are required for a definitive diagnosis of septicemia, but results are not usually available for 48 to 72 hours, and false negatives are common. Laboratory parameters that have been proposed to identify potentially septic calves include hypoglycemia, left shift of neutrophils, and signs of toxicity of neutrophils. 20 No single laboratory test has emerged as being completely reliable for the early diagnosis of septicemia in farm animal neonates, and therefore scoring systems and predictive models using obtainable historical, clinical, and clinicopathologic data have been developed. 20 The goal of these mathematical models is to identify septicemic neonates early in the course of disease when appropriate therapy would be most likely to result in a favorable outcome. In a study of diarrheic calves under 28 days of age submitted to a referral clinic for treatment, 31% of the calves were septicemic, based on blood culture. Two models to predict septicemia were used. Clinicopathologic variables associated with an increased risk of septicemia were moderate (1.99 to 5.55 mg/dL) and marked (>5.66 mg/dL) increases in serum creatinine (OR 8.63), moderate to marked toxic changes in neutrophils (OR 2.88), and FTPI (IgG concentrations \u03b2 800 mg/dL, globulin \u03b2 2 g/dL [OR 2.72], and total serum protein \u03b2 5 g/dL).

It may occur in calves as early as 1 day of age and only rarely up to 3 weeks. The clinical severity will vary depending on the number and kind of organisms causing the disease. The presence of a single ETEC may cause a state of collapse usually designated as enteric toxemia. In this form of the disease the outstanding clinical signs include severe weakness, coma, subnormal temperature, cold and clammy skin, pale mucosae, wetness around the mouth, collapse of superficial veins, slowness and irregularity of the heart, mild convulsive movements, and periodic apnea. Diarrhea is usually not evident, although the abdomen may be slightly distended, and succussion and auscultation may reveal fluid-splashing sounds suggesting a fluid-filled intestine.

            "text": "In the more common form of the disease in calves, there is diarrhea in which the feces are profuse and watery to pasty, usually pale yellow to white in color, and occasionally streaked with blood flecks and very foulsmelling. The dry-matter content of the feces is commonly below 10%. Defecation is frequent and effortless, and the tail and perineum are soiled with feces. The temperature is usually normal in the initial stages but becomes subnormal as the disease worsens. Affected calves may or may not suck or drink depending on the degrees of acidosis, dehydration, and weakness. Calves under 8 days of age may be weak, primarily from the effects of rapid and severe dehydration; in calves older than 8 days the acidemia and metabolic acidosis, a considerable part of which is a result of the accumulation of D-lactic acid, tend to be more severe and make a greater contribution to obtundation and weakness. In the early stages of the disease, the abdomen may be slightly distended as a result of distension of fluid-filled intestines, which can be detected by succussion and auscultation of the abdomen. In some of these calves the diarrhea is not yet obvious but is delayed for several hours, when it can become quite profuse. Mildly to moderately affected calves may be diarrheic for a few days and recover spontaneously with or without treatment. However, 15% to 20% of calves with enteric colibacillosis become progressively worse over a period of 3 to 5 days, gradually become more weak, lose the desire to suck, and progressively appear more obviously dehydrated. Throughout the course of the diarrhea the degree of dehydration will vary from just barely detectable clinically (4% to 6% of body weight [BW] ) to up to 10% to 16% of body weight. The degree of dehydration can be estimated by \"tenting\" the skin of the lateral portion of the cervical region and measuring the time required for the skin fold to return to normal. In calves with 8% dehydration, 5 to 10 seconds will be required for the skin fold to return to normal; in 10% to 12% dehydration, up to 30 seconds will be required. Recession of the eyeball (enophthalmos) is an alternative method validated to reliably estimate the degree of dehydration in diarrheic calves. Slight sinking of the eyeball without an obvious space between the eyeball and the orbit represents 6% to 8% dehydration, moderate separation of the eyeball from the orbit represents 9% to 12% dehydration, and marked separation of the eyeball from the orbit represents over 12% and up to 16% dehydration. A summary of the relationship between degree of dehydration (% BW), depth of enophthalmos (mm), cervical skin tent duration in seconds, and the state of the mucous membranes and extremities in calves with experimentally induced diarrhea is set out in Table 19 -12. 1 Affected calves can lose 10% to 16% of their original body weight during the first 24 to 48 hours of the diarrhea. The hyperkalemia in calves with neonatal diarrhea has been associated with cardiac rate and rhythm abnormalities, including bradycardia and atrial standstill. Herd outbreaks of the disease in beef calves may last for several weeks, during which time almost every calf will be affected within several days after birth.",

Table 19 -13 lists the possible causative agents of diarrhea and septicemia in newborn farm animals. Using the combined diagnostic approach of detection of enteropathogens in the feces before death and in the intestinal mucosa after death, it is possible to identify where ETEC, rotavirus, coronavirus, Salmonella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. appear to be the only or principal causative agents. However, mixed infections are more common than single infections. Every effort that is economically possible should be made to obtain an etiologic diagnosis. This is especially important when outbreaks of diarrhea occur in a herd or when the disease appears to be endemic. The use of an interdisciplinary approach will increase the success of diagnosis. This includes making a visit to the farm or herd and making a detailed epidemiologic investigation of the problem. The diagnosis depends heavily on the epidemiologic findings, the microbiological and pathologic findings, and sometimes on the results of treatment.",

            "text": "The ability of fecal bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer technique to guide treatment in calf diarrhea is questionable when applied to fecal E. coli isolates that have not been identified as enterotoxigenic. There do not appear to be any data demonstrating that fecal bacterial flora is representative of the bacterial flora of the small intestine, which is the physiologically important site of infection in calf diarrhea. Marked changes in small-intestinal bacterial populations can occur without changes in fecal bacterial populations, and the predominant strain of E. coli in the feces of a diarrheic calf can change several times during the diarrhea episode. Furthermore, and most importantly, 45% of calves with diarrhea had different strains of E. coli isolated from the upper and lower small intestine, indicating that fecal E. coli strains are not always representative of small-intestinal E. coli strains. Marked discrepancies in antimicrobial resistance among E. coli strains isolated from different segments of the upper and lower intestinal tract of healthy veal calves at slaughter have also been reported in a more recent study. 24 An additional bias present in most antimicrobial susceptibility studies conducted on fecal E. coli isolates is that data are frequently obtained from dead calves, which are likely to be treatment failures. The time since death is also likely to be an important determinant of the value of fecal culture because such a rapid proliferation of bacteria occurs in the alimentary tract after death that the results of examinations made on dead calves received at the laboratory can have little significance. Calves that die of diarrhea are likely to have received multiple antimicrobial treatments, and preferential growth of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains starts within 3 hours of antimicrobial administration. A further concern with fecal susceptibility testing is that the Kirby-Bauer breakpoints (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) are not based on typical antimicrobial concentrations in the small intestine and blood of calves. Studies documenting the antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli isolates from the small intestine of untreated calves, based on achievable drug concentrations and dosage regimens, are urgently needed. Until these data are available, it appears that antimicrobial efficacy is best evaluated by the clinical response to treatment, rather than the results of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed on fecal E. coli isolates. Thus, the value of antimicrobial susceptibility testing as a tool to guide the choice of an antibiotic to treat enterotoxigenic colibacillosis must currently be considered as very limited. Nonetheless, antimicrobial susceptibility testing presents an important tool to monitor the development of resistances not only of pathogens, but also of so-called indicator bacteria normally isolated in healthy animals in the field. 25, 26 Because antimicrobial resistance can be transferred via plasmids from apathogenic bacteria to pathogens, monitoring trends in resistance patterns in the field is of critical importance.",

A comparison of antibiotic resistance for E. coli populations isolated from groups of diarrheic and control calves in the United Kingdom found a higher incidence of antibioticresistant E. coli in samples obtained from farms with calf diarrhea than from farms without the disease.

E. coli strains from outbreaks of diarrhea in lambs in Spain became increasingly resistant to nalidixic acid, enoxacin, and enrofloxacin. Some antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains from diarrheic calves in the United States may possess a chromosomal flo gene that specifies cross-resistance to both florfenicol and chloramphenicol, and its presence among E. coli isolates of diverse genetic backgrounds indicates a distribution much wider than previously thought. In Spain, 5.9% of E. coli strains from cattle were resistant to nalidixic acid, and 4.9% were resistant to enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In sheep and goats, only 0.5% and 1.4%, respectively, of the strains were resistant to nalidixic acid, and none was resistant to fluoroquinolones. Most of the quinolone-resistant strains were nonpathogenic strains isolated from cattle. Susceptibility data obtained from 10 European countries for the years 2002 to 2004 revealed that although there was a generally high prevalence of resistance of E. coli isolated from diarrheic calves, resistance patterns varied considerably between countries. 25 Generally high resistance of E. coli in the range of 50% or higher was reported from most countries for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, combinations of trimethoprim and sulfonamides, and tetracyclines. 25 Although resistance of E. coli isolated from diarrheic calves against fluoroquinolones was rare in several countries, resistance rates at or above 20% were reported from Spain, Belgium, and France. 25 In certain regions of Italy the incidence of enrofloxacin-resistant E coli strains was reported to have increased from 14.2% in 2002 to over 40% in 2008. 27 The CTX-M-14-like enzyme has been detected in E. coli recovered from the feces of diarrheic dairy calves in Wales. The enzyme is an extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL), which confers resistance to a wide range of beta-lactam (penicillin and cephalosporin) compounds. Organisms possessing ESBLs are considered to be resistant to second-, third-, and fourthgeneration cephalosporins, and in vitro resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate among producers is variable, reflecting the amount of beta-lactamase produced. In addition to this enzyme, the isolates produced a TEM-35 (IRT-4) beta-lactamase that conferred resistance to the amoxicillin/clavulanate combination. These two enzymes confer resistance to all the beta-lactamase compounds approved for veterinary use in the United Kingdom. Thus their occurrence in animals may be an important development for both animal and public health. ESBLs in human infections have emerged as a significant and developing problem, occurring in patients in the community and in those with recent hospital contact. Spread of this form of resistance in bacteria affecting the animal population could have serious implications for animal health, rendering many therapeutic options redundant.",

Susceptibility of fecal and environmental E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. to tetracyclines was monitored on farms during use of medicated milk replacer and after discontinuation of this practice. Discontinuing the use of medicated milk replacer resulted in increased susceptibility of these organisms to tetracyclines within 3 months, without causing an increase of disease occurrence. 28 Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Blood Escherichia coli Isolates The Kirby-Bauer technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing has more clinical relevance for predicting the clinical response to antimicrobial treatment when applied to blood isolates rather than fecal isolates. This is because the Kirby-Bauer breakpoints (MICs) are based on achievable antimicrobial concentrations in human plasma and MIC 90 values for human E. coli isolates, which provide a reasonable approximation to achievable MIC values in calf plasma and MIC 90 values for bovine E. coli isolates. Unfortunately, susceptibility results are not available for at least 48 hours, and very few studies have documented the antimicrobial susceptibility of blood isolates in calves with diarrhea. In a 1997 study of dairy calves in California, the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from the blood of calves with severe diarrhea or illness produced the following results: ceftiofur, 19/25 (76%) sensitive; potentiated sulfonamides, 14/25 (56%) sensitive; gentamicin, 12/25 (48%) sensitive; ampicillin, 11/25 (44%) sensitive; tetracycline, 3/25 (12%) sensitive, although there was a clinically significant year-toyear difference in the results of susceptibility testing that may have reflected different antimicrobial administration protocols on the farm.",

Accordingly, it is recommended that clinicians routinely assume that 30% of ill calves with diarrhea are bacteremic and that bacteremia constitutes a threat to the life of the calf. Antimicrobial treatment of diarrheic calves should therefore be practiced and focused against E. coli in the small intestine and blood because these constitute the two sites of infection. In addition, the antimicrobial must reach therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection for a long enough period (the treatment interval) and, ideally, have only a narrow gram-negative spectrum of activity to minimize collateral damage to other enteric bacteria. Fecal bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not recommended in calves with diarrhea because fecal bacterial populations do not accurately reflect small-intestinal or blood bacterial populations, and the breakpoints for susceptibility test results have not been validated.

Concurrent feeding of milk and amoxicillin does not change the bioavailability of amoxicillin, although amoxicillin is absorbed faster when dissolved in an oral electrolyte solution than in milk replacer, and absorption is slowed during endotoxemia, presumably because of a decrease in abomasal emptying rate. Amoxicillin trihydrate is preferred to ampicillin trihydrate for oral administration in calves because it is labeled for the treatment of calf diarrhea in the United States and is absorbed to a much greater extent. However, a field study comparing oral amoxicillin (400 mg every 12 h) and ampicillin (400 mg every 12 h) treatments for diarrhea reported similar proportions of calves with a good to excellent clinical response (79%, 49/62 for amoxicillin bolus; 80%, 59/74 for amoxicillin powder; 65%, 47/65 for ampicillin bolus; p > 0.30 for all comparisons).

The prognosis is unfavorable if the level of immunoglobulin is low at the onset of diarrhea, regardless of intensive fluid and antimicrobial therapy. Most of the literature on therapy omits this information and is therefore difficult to assess. There is ample evidence that the mortality rate will be high in diarrheic calves that are deficient in serum immunoglobulin, particularly IgG, in spite of exhaustive antimicrobial and fluid therapy. This has stimulated interest in the possible use of purified solutions of bovine gammaglobulin in diarrheic calves that are hypogammaglobulinemic. However, they must be given by the intravenous route and in large amounts, the cost of which would be prohibitive. In addition, they are unlikely to be of value once the calf is affected with diarrhea; they are protective and probably not curative. Whole blood transfusion to severely affected calves may be used as a source of gammaglobulin, but unless given in large quantities will not significantly elevate serum immunoglobulin concentrations in deficient calves. Limited controlled trials indicate that there is no significant difference in the survival rate of diarrheic calves treated with either a blood transfusion daily for 3 days; fluid therapy given orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously, depending on the severity of the dehydration; or fluid therapy with antibiotics. Those calves that survived, regardless of the type of therapy, had high immunoglobulin concentrations before they developed diarrhea. This emphasizes the importance of the calf ingesting liberal quantities of colostrum within the first few hours after birth.",

Adequate pain management should be part of any state-ofthe-art treatment approach. Diarrhea can be accompanied by abdominal pain as a result of intestinal inflammation and cramping. In addition to controlling pain, the main objectives of antiinflammatory therapy in animals with colibacillosis are to control the inflammatory process in the intestinal tract and to ameliorate the effects of endotoxemia and septicemia. 32 Several field studies reported that diarrheic calves receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in conjunction with fluid therapy showed less signs of pain, made a faster recovery, and had better weight gains in the reconvalescent period. 33 Although the underlying mechanisms do not appear to have been studied in detail, the proven beneficial effects of several NSAIDs have been attributed to their analgesic, antiinflammatory, antipyretic, and antisecretory properties.",

Little evidence documenting the efficacy of corticosteroids for the treatment of calf diarrhea is available, but the use of this class of antiinflammatory drugs has been discouraged on the theoretical grounds that diarrheic calves already tend to have higher concentrations of plasma cortisol of endogenous origin and because of the immunosuppressive effect of these compounds. 32 The efficacy of different NSAIDs such as meloxicam, ketoprofen, or flunixin meglumine in diarrheic calves that were systemically ill has been investigated in several studies. 32 A single treatment with meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) and treatment with ketoprofen (6 mg/kg IV) twice, 4 hours apart, were both found to improve general attitude, the fecal score, and the feed intake of systemically affected calves with diarrhea. 32 Flunixin meglumine (2.2 mg/kg IV) hastened clinical recovery, but only for animals that had visible amounts of blood in feces. 34 Because treatment with NSAIDs in diarrheic animals bears the risk of causing renal damage by further decreasing renal perfusion in already dehydrated animals, adequate oral and/or parenteral fluid therapy must be assured. An empirical guideline posits that treatment with NSAIDs should be limited to a single treatment whenever possible but should not exceed three treatments, a recommendation that has been justified by the risk of abomasal ulceration that is associated with prolonged use of these antiinflammatory agents. 32",

Compounds such as hyoscine-Nbutylbromide and atropine have a proven inhibitory effect on intestinal motility, which undisputedly results in a rapid decrease of the fecal output in diarrheic patients. Although reducing fecal production may be interpreted as positive treatment outcome, it can also be seen as sequestration of gut fluid in the intestinal tract. Delaying the excretion of intestinal contents in patients suffering from malabsorptive diarrhea bears the risk of enhanced fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates and other nutrients. This could not only exacerbate enteral dysbiosis, but also the accumulation of D-lactic acid, which was found to markedly contribute to the clinical symptoms observed in diarrheic calves. 12 There does not appear to be any hard evidence in favor or against the use of antimotility drugs in diarrheic animals. Their use is nonetheless discouraged based on the possible negative effects that certainly outweigh the subjective perception of clinical improvement that is based on the apparent reduction of feces production. 32, 35 Intestinal Protectants Intestinal protectants such as kaolin and pectin are in general use for diarrheic animals; however, as with antimotility drugs, their value is uncertain. When they are used, the feces become bulky, but intestinal protectants do not have any known effect on the pathogenesis of the disease.",

Diarrheic piglets are usually treated with an antimicrobial orally and left to nurse on the sow. Diarrheic beef calves are commonly treated with oral fluids and electrolytes and left with the cow. However, in dairy calves it is a common practice to reduce the milk intake of diarrheic animals for up to 24 hours or until there is clinical evidence of improvement. The withholding of milk from diarrheic calves has been advocated based on the consideration that lactose digestion is impaired and that \"resting\" the intestine for a few days will consequently minimize additional osmotic diarrhea caused by fermentation of undigested lactose in the large intestine. In contrast, the argument in favor of continuous feeding of milk is that the intestinal tract requires a constant source of nutrition, which it receives from the ingesta in the lumen of the intestine. To date, there is no scientific evidence available confirming that transiently starving diarrheic animals has any beneficial effects on the clinical outcome. Studies exploring the effect of continuous milk feeding in diarrheic calves failed to confirm any deleterious effect, such as prolonged morbidity time, higher mortality rate, or higher treatment frequency. To the contrary, calves kept on milk had higher weight gains during the period of reconvalscence. 32, 36 Although diarrheic animals clearly should be supplemented with oral electrolyte solutions to assist the compensation of excessive fluid and electrolyte loss, the currently available evidence is clearly in favor of maintaining the animal on milk or milk replacer. Calves should be offered reduced quantities of whole milk per feeding with higher feeding frequency. Milk should not be diluted with water because this may interfere with the clotting mechanism in the abomasum. In contrast to oral electrolyte solutions, milk should not be force-fed with an esophageal tube feeder because this will prevent closure of the reticular groove and thus foster accumulation of milk in the rumen, where it would be subject to bacterial fermentation.",

Unfortunately, to date there are no published clinical data obtained in animals supporting any of these claims. Of particular concern is that the use of probiotics in humans has been associated with Lactobacillus bacteremia in several immunocompromised patients, and deleterious effects with some commercial products have been observed in neonatal foals. 39 In veterinary medicine concerns have been voiced about the uncritical use of probiotics, particularly in neonates with systemic disease or with a compromised intestinal mucosa. 40, 41 With the current knowledge, the use of probiotics cannot be recommended for treatment or prevention of neonatal diarrhea.",

Although the optimum amount of colostrum that should be ingested by a certain time after birth is well known, the major difficulty with all species under practical conditions is to know how much colostrum a particular neonate has ingested. Because modern livestock production has become so intensive, it is imperative that the animal attendants make every effort to ensure that sufficient colostrum is ingested by that particular species. In a recent national survey in the United States, the estimated prevalence of failure of passive immunity transfer in female dairy calves was 19.2%. 41 Failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI), as determined by calf serum immunoglobulin IgG 1 concentration below 1000 mg/dL at 48 hours of age, occurred in 61.4% of calves from a dairy in which calves were nursed by their dams, 19.3% of calves from a dairy using nipple bottle feeding, and 10.8% of calves from a dairy using tube feeding. A higher prevalence of FTPI in dairy calves can occur because an insufficient volume of colostrum is ingested by the calf. When artificial feeding is used, inadequate immunoglobulin concentration in the colostrum fed is the most important factor resulting in FTPI. The prevalence of FTPI in dairy herds can be minimized by artificially feeding all newborn calves large volumes (3 to 4 L) of fresh or refrigerated first-milking colostrum from cows that had nonlactating intervals of normal duration. This volume is considerably greater than the intake that Holstein calves usually achieve by sucking and also exceeds the voluntary intake of most calves fed colostrum by nipple bottle.",

Measurement of the specific gravity of the colostrum of dairy cows with a commercially available hydrometer (Colostrometer) has been explored. Originally it was claimed that measurement of specific gravity provided an inexpensive and practical method for estimating colostral immunoglobulin concentration. However, the specific gravity of colostrum is more correlated with its protein concentration than immunoglobulin concentration and varies with colostral temperature, thus limiting the predictive accuracy of the test. In addition, different relationships between specific gravity and immunoglobulin concentration of colostrum have been observed for different populations of Holstein Friesian and Jersey cows and between herds. Specific gravity may also vary considerably according to season of the year. Specific gravity was measured in 1085 first-milking colostrum samples from 608 dairy cows of four breeds on a single farm during a 5-year period. The specific gravity more closely reflected protein concentration than IgG concentration and was markedly affected by month of calving. Colostral specific gravity values were highest for Holstein and Jersey cows, cows in third or later lactation, and cows calving in autumn. They were lowest in Brown Swiss and Ayrshire cows, cows in first or second lactation, and cows calving in summer.

Good protection is also possible when the dams are vaccinated with a four-strain E. coli wholecell bacterin containing sufficient F5 pilus antigen and the polysaccharide capsular K antigen. Colostral antibodies specific for F5 pilus antigen and the polysaccharide capsular K antigen on the surface of the challenge exposure strain of ETEC are protective. There is a highly significant correlation between lacteal immunity to the F5 antigen and the prevention of severe diarrhea or death in calves challenged with enterotoxigenic E. coli. The colostral levels of F5 antibody are highest during the first 2 days after parturition, which is the most susceptible period for enterotoxigenic colibacillosis to occur in the newborn calf. The continuous presence of the F5 antibody in the lumen of the intestine prevents adherence of the bacteria to the intestinal epithelium. The F5 antibody is also absorbed during the period of immunoglobulin absorption and may be excreted into the intestine during diarrhea. This may be one of the reasons that mortality is inversely proportional to serum immunoglobulin levels. The pregnant dams are vaccinated twice in the first year, 6 and 2 weeks before parturition. Each year thereafter they are given a single booster vaccination. An oil-emulsion E. coli F5 bacterin given once or twice to pregnant beef cows 6 weeks before calving elicited high levels of serum antibodies that provided protection against experimental infection of newborn calves for up to 87 weeks after vaccination.",

On a practical basis this suggests that gilts should be mixed with older sows that have been resident on the premises for some time. The length of time required for such natural immunization to occur is uncertain, but 1 month during late gestation seems logical. Naturally occurring enteric colibacillosis in newborn piglets can be effectively controlled by vaccination of the pregnant dam. Field trials in large-scale farm conditions indicate that the vaccines are efficacious. Partial budget analysis of vaccinating pregnant sows with E. coli vaccines revealed an economic return on investment of 124% because of the decrease in morbidity and mortality resulting from diarrhea in piglets at 1 to 2 weeks of age. Three antigen types of pili, designated F4, F5, and F6, are now implicated in colonization of the small intestine of newborn piglets by ETEC. The vaccination of pregnant sows with oral or parenteral vaccines containing these antigens will provide protection against enterotoxigenic colibacillosis associated with E. coli bearing pili homologous to those in the vaccines. The parenteral vaccines are cellfree preparations of pili, and the oral vaccines contain live enteropathogenic E. coli. The oral vaccine is given 2 weeks before farrowing and is administered in the feed daily for 3 days as 200 mL per day of a broth culture containing 10 11 E. coli. A simple and effective method of immunization of pregnant sows is to feed live cultures of ETEC isolated from piglets affected with neonatal colibacillosis on the same farm. The oral vaccine can be given in the feed, beginning about 8 weeks after breeding and continued to parturition. The oral vaccine results in the stimulation of IgA antibody in the intestinal tract, which is then transferred to the mammary gland and into the colostrum. A combination of oral and parenteral vaccination is superior to either route alone. The parenteral vaccine is given about 2 weeks after breeding and repeated 2 to 4 weeks before parturition. The parenteral vaccination results in the production of high levels of IgM antibody for protection against both experimental and naturally occurring enterotoxigenic colibacillosis. This vaccination also reduces the number of E. coli excreted in the feces of vaccinated sows, which are major sources of the organism. Immunization of pregnant sows with an E. coli bacterin enriched with the F4 antigen results in the secretion of milk capable of preventing adhesion of F4 E. coli to the gut for at least 5 weeks after birth, at which time the piglet becomes naturally resistant to adhesion by the organism.",

The wetness or dryness of the umbilicus is used as a surrogate measure of age in welfare regulations, and the requirement is that the umbilical cord at the junction with the abdominal skin should be dry and shriveled. The drying time varies from 1 to 8 days, with variation between breeds and a longer drying period in bull calves. As might be expected, this measure is only an approximate surrogate for age, but approximately 90% of calves have dry navels by 4 days of age. 1 Incidence of the disease is scarcely reported. The 30-day incidence of clinically apparent omphalitis in Thoroughbred foals in the United Kingdom was 0.7%, which was not reduced by administration of antimicrobials prophylactically. 2 Omphalitis was considered the cause of death in 23% of 247 calves 4 to 7 days of age that died during the preslaughter period (12 to 18 hours) at abattoirs in New Zealand. 1 The death rate was 0.7%, of which 23% was attributable to omphalitis. Omphalitis was the cause of wastage (condemnation of the carcass) in 54% of calves examined after slaughter. 1 Infection of the umbilicus occurs soon after birth and can result in omphalitis, omphalophlebitis, omphaloarteritis, or infection of the urachus, with possible extension to the bladder, causing cystitis. There is usually a mixed bacterial flora including E. coli, Proteus spp., Staphylococcus spp., T. pyogenes, Bacteroides spp., F. necrophorum, and Klebsiella spp. The most common, and presumed clinically important, infections in foals are by E. coli and S. zooepidemicus. Infection of umbilical remnants in foals by Clostridium sordelli causes peritonitis, urachitis, omphalophlebitis, and omphaloarteritis. 3 Bacteremia and localization with infection may occur in joints, bone, meninges, eyes, endocardium, and end-arteries of the feet, ears, and tail. The navel can also be the source of infection, leading to septicemia, arthritis, and fever of unknown origin in neonates with FTPI. The incidence of abnormalities of the umbilicus and consequent rate of umbilical infection is high in cloned calves. [2] [3] [4] [5] ",

On heavily infected premises the administration of long-acting penicillin at birth may be advisable. A major factor in the control of navel and joint ill in lambs is the use of clean fields or pens for lambing because umbilical infection originating from the environment seems to be more important than infection from the dam in this species. Docking should also be done in clean surroundings; if necessary, temporary yards should be erected. Instruments should be chemically sterilized between lambs. Regardless of species and where practicable, all parturition stalls and pens should be kept clean and disinfected, and the navels of all newborn animals should be disinfected at birth.

The theory of competitive exclusion technology is to colonize the neonatal gastrointestinal tract with beneficial/commensal bacteria considered to be the normal flora of the healthy animals of a particular species. The mechanism of action is not known, but hypotheses include the following: exclusion of enteropathogens by competitive attachment sites and/or for nutrients; stimulation of the local immune mechanisms, which precludes colonization/invasion by enteric pathogens; and the production of various antimicrobial substances that either have direct action on pathogenic bacteria or produce conditions within the intestine that are unfavorable for the growth and colonization by pathogens. Experimentally, the oral administration of a porcine competitive exclusion culture to piglets within 12 hours after birth resulted in significant reductions in mortality, incidence of fecal shedding, and intestinal colonization by E. coli compared with control values. Mortality decreased from 23% in the control group to 2.7% in the treated group.",

Vaccination of pregnant does 1 month before parturition with a subunit vaccine containing F4, F5, and F6 fimbrial antigens of E. coli and C. perfringens types B, C, and D toxins in an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, along with improved management conditions, was highly successful in reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality resulting from diarrhea. Compared with two control groups, one in which no improvement in management was made and the second in which improvements were made without vaccination, in the vaccinated group with improved management conditions, neonatal morbidity and mortality were both reduced by a factor of 3 in group 1 and by factors of 9.5 and 12.5 in groups 2 and 3, respectively.
