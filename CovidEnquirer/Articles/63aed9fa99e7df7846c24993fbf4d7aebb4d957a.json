            "text": "C57B1/6N mice by intracranial injection of a coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus strain A59) is followed by functional recovery and efficient CNS myelin repair. To study the biological properties of the cells involved in this repair process, glial ceils were isolated and cultured from spinal cords of these young adult mice during demyelination and remyelination. Using three-color immunofluorescence combined with [3H]thymidine autoradiography, we have analyzed the antigenic phenotype and mitotic potential of individual glial cells. We identified oligodendrocytes with an antibody to galactocerebroside, astrocytes with an antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein, and oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells with the 04 antibody. Cultures from demyelinated tissue differed in several ways from those of agematched controls: first, the total number of O-2A lin-cage cells was strikingly increased; second, the O-2A population consisted of a higher proportion of 04positive astrocytes and cells of mixed oligodendrocyteastrocyte phenotype; and third, all the cell types within the O-2A lineage showed enhanced proliferation. This proliferation was not further enhanced by adding PDGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to the defined medium. However, bFGF and IGF-I seemed to influence the fate of O-2A lineage cells in cultures of demyelinated tissue. Basic FGF decreased the percentage of cells expressing galactocerebroside. In contrast, IGF-I increased the relative proportion of oligodendrocytes. Thus, O-2A lineage cells from adult mice display greater phenotypic plasticity and enhanced mitotic potential in response to an episode of demyelination. These properties may be linked to the efficient remyelination achieved in this demyelinating disease. I ~ demyelinating diseases, damage to myelin sheaths disrupts conduction of electrical impulses along axonal processes of neurons. Typically, damaged myelin is not efficiently repaired in the human CNS (Perier and Gregoire, 1965; Prineas et al., 1984) . Thus patients with CNS demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, frequently experience prolonged neurological dysfunction. In contrast, efficient remyelination and functional recovery is achieved in rodents in certain experimental models of CNS demyelination (reviewed in Ludwin, 1981) . One such model is produced by infecting C57B1/6N mice with a coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus strain A59; MHV-A59), which leads to the development of multiple CNS demyelinating lesions (Lavi et al., 1984; Jordan et al., 1989) . This coronavirus replicates in glial cells during an early phase of the disease and is subsequently cleared from the CNS (Jordan et al., 1989) . Infected mice exhibit clinical signs of CNS demyelin-ation within the first week post infection (wpi)? By 3-5 wpi, focal areas of demyelination are present throughout the CNS, with prominent lesions in the spinal cord. In the following weeks, remyelination is paralleled by functional recovery. Using this model, we can analyze the processes involved in regeneration of the cells that form CNS myelin.",

In vitro studies of optic nerve from newborn rat have characterized a bipotential progenitbr cell that can give rise to oligodendrocytes or to type 2 astrocytes, 'and is therefore called an oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell. Type 2 astrocytes express antigens that are also present on the surface of O-2A progenitor cells. The localization and function of type 2 astrocytes in vivo is not clear at the present time. Another type of astrocyte, called the type 1 astrocyte; appears before type 2 astrocytes and arises from a glial precursor distinct from the O-2A progenitor (Raft et al., 1984) . Type 1 astrocytes secrete growth factors that affect the proliferation, migration, and/or differentiation of O-2A progenitors (reviewed in Raft, 1989; Dubois-Dalcq and Armstrong, 1990) . Upon maturation, oligodendrocytes elaborate extensive processes which wrap around CNS axons to form myelin (reviewed in Paine, 1984) . Perinodal astrocytes, possibly type 2 astrocytes, extend processes to nodes of Ranvier, which are electrically excitable regions of axons between adjacent myelin sheaths (ffrench-Constant and Raft, 1986b; ffrench-Constant et al., 1986) . Both oligodendrocytes and perinodal astrocytes seem to play a role in efficient saltatory conduction of nerve impulses; myelin acts as an electrical insulator while perinodal astrocytic processes may serve various functions associated with impulse propagation at nodes (discussed in Ritchie, 1984; Black and Waxman, 1988) .",

Proliferation of oligodendrocytes, or oligodendrocTte precursor cells, during demyelination appears to be necessary to facilitate remyelination. Electron microscopic autoradiographic analyses of demyelinating tissue have reported mitosis of oligodendrocytes at several stages of maturation (Herndon et al., 1977; Ludwin, 1979; Aranella and Herndon, 1984; Ludwin and Bakker, 1988) . A recent in vivo analysis combining immunolabeling with autoradiography has shown that O-2A progenitor cells and astrocytes that express 04 antigens proliferate early in the course of demyelination induced by coronavirus infection and that some cells generated during demyelination later became oligodendrocytes (Godfraind et al., 1989) . In the present study, we have developed an in vitro system to further characterize the cells involved in the remyelination process. We have used threecolor immunofluorescence combined with autoradiography to identify specific glial cell types. In such a system we can analyze the proliferative capacity, phenotypic plasticity, and differentiation potential of the various types of glial cells which may play a key role in CNS remyelination.",

Oligodendrocytes were identified by expression of cell surface antigens recognized by anti-GC (Raft et al., 1978) , Cells containing intracellular filaments immunostained with anti-GFAP were classified as astrocytes (Biguami et al., 1972; Rafter al., 1979) . Type 2 astrocytes were distinguished from type 1 astrocytes by the expression of cell surface antigens recognized by the 04 antibody (Trotter and Schachner, 1989) . O-2A progenitors derived from adult CNS were identified as cells binding 04 in the absence of GC or GFAP immunolabeling (Wolswijk and Noble, 1989) . Thus, any particular cell could be identified as an oligodendrocyte (04+ GC+ GFAP-), a type 2 astrocyt\u00a2 (04+ GFAP+ GC-), an O-2A progenitor (04+ G C -GFAP-), a mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype cell (04+ GC+ GFAP+), or a type 1 astrocyte (GFAP+ 0 4 -GC-). (In this paper, the term \"type 2 astrocyte\" will be used to denote only the 04+ GFAP+ G C -antigenic phenotype and is not intended to indicate a specific localization or function in vivo.) Glial cells were isolated and cultured in parallel from spinal cords of infected and age-matched control mice at several intervals after viral inoculation. These cultures contained various types of glial cells, of which O-2A lineage cells (oligodendrocytes, O-2A progenitors, type 2 astrocytes, and mixed phenotype cells) represented a small proportion of the total. The number of O-2A lineage cells was counted after 1 d in culture (Fig. 2) . This number was similar for control and experimental tissue at 1 wpi (Fig. 2) when demyelination was not yet detected (see Fig. 3, A and B) . As demyelination and vacuolation progressed (3-5 wpi, see Fig. 3 C) , O-2A lineage cells were much more abundant in cultures of the demyelinated tissue (Fig. 2) . With the onset of remyelination (6-8 wpi, see Fig. 3 D) , the number of O-2A lineage cells derived from lesioned tissue declined (Fig. 2) . It is possible that CNS inflammation and vacuolation may have facilitated dissociation of the demyelinated tissue and thereby improved the yield of growing c\u00a211s. Yet the cultures from control versus demyelinated CNS differed not only in cell The other cell types in our cultures were type 1 astrocytes, fibroblasts, and microglia. Flat calls expressing GFAP but not 04 antigens were identified as type 1 astrocytes. Type 1 astrocytes seemed to be more prevalent in cultures of lesioned tissue. However, at 1 div such cells were usually found in dense clusters that prohibited accurate quantitation of the initial type 1,astrocyte population (Fig. 4, A and C) . By 3 and 6div, type 1 astrocytes grew out from these clusters and proliferated, as assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 4, B and D) . Flat cells presumed to be fibroblasts, due to the absence of 04, GC, or GFAP immunostaining, were present and p~liferated in all cultures examined (not shown).",

The relative proportion of type 2 astrocytes (04+ GFAP+ G C -) increased between 1 and 3 div, even though the cultures were maintained in defined medium with only 0.5 % FBS (Figs. 5 and 7). Interestingly, in cultures of neonatal rat optic nerve, 10% FBS is required to induce development of a substantial number of type 2 astrocyteg (Raft et al., 1983) . In cultures of demyel~ated spinal cord tissue (5 wpi), oligodendrocytes were the predominant cell type after 1 div (Fig. 5) . However, a larger percentage of the O-2A population was composed of type 2 astroeytes in these cultures as compared with cultures of control tissue. By 3 div, type 2 astrocytes became even more prevalent than oligodendrocytes. At each time point, O-2A progenitor cells represented ,,020% of the O-2A lineage population. A remarkable feature in cultures from demyelinated tissue was the presence of mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype cells, which were rarely seen in control cultures (Fig. 5) . These cells expressed GC on their surface and contained intracellular filaments immunostained with GFAP (Fig. 8) . Such mixed phenotype cells (04+ GC+ GFAP+) were found consistently using two different antibodies to GC in combination with two different antibodies to GFAP (see Materials and Methods). Certain growth factors have been shown to have an effect on the fate of O-2A lineage cells: IGF-I promotes oligodendrocyte development (McMorris et al., 1986) , whereas bFGF inhibits myelin gene expression (McKirmon and Dubois-Dalcq, 1990 ). Therefore, we examined whether treatment with such growth factors from 1-3 div would influence the antigenic phenotypes expressed by O-2A lineage cells isolated during the course of demyelination and remyelination (Fig. 9 ). In cultures of demyelinating/remyelinating tissue exogenous IGF-I increased the proportion of oligodendrocytes relative to type 2 astrocytes, whereas bFGF decreased the relative number of oligodendrocytes. PDGF did not markedly alter the ratio of type 2 astrocytes to oligodendrocytes, in agreement with the observation that PDGF allows timely differentiation of oligodendroeytes and type 2 astroeytes in cultures of developing CNS tissue Raft et al., 1988) .",

To further explore the mitotic potential of O-2A lineage cells from adult CNS, we prepared cultures from spinal cords of normal and infected mice after in vivo labeling with [3H]thymidine during a 2-h terminal pulse (Table I) . Cells undergoing active DNA synthesis were identified after 1 div by [3I-I]thymidine autoradiography combined with triple-label immunocytochemistry, as outlined in Fig. 1 A. The proportion of O-2A lineage cells (oligodendrocytes, O-2A progenitors, and type 2 astrocytes) which were thymidine-labeled was extremely low in control cultures prepared from normal mice at 5 wk of age (0.52%) and at 8 wk of age (0 %). In contrast, the proportion of O-2A lineage cells (oligodendrocytes, O-2A progenitors, type 2 astrocytes, and mixed phenotype cells) that were pH]thymidine-labeled in cultures derived from infected tissue was markedly higher both in the early phase of the disease (4.96% at 1 wpi; 5 wk of age) and at the time of widespread demyelination (5.38% at 4 wpi; 8 wk of age). We next examined the proliferative capacity of the cultured cells during an in vitro pulse of [3H]thymidine (Table  I ). In this case proliferation in vitro was measured by adding [SH] thymidine to the culture medium at 2 div, fixing the cells 20 h later, and then identifying [3H]thymidine-labeled cells by autoradiography combined with three-fluorochrome immunocytochemistry, as outlined in Fig. 1 B. The percentage of O-2A lineage cells that were labeled in vitro with pH]thymidine was approximately ninefold higher in cultures derived from diseased mice at 1 wpi than in cultures from age-matched control mice, and was increased more than threefold at 4 wpi (Table I) . Oligodendrocytes (Fig. 10) , type 2 astrocytes (Fig. 11) , O-2A progenitors (Fig. 12) , and mixed phenotype cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine after the 20-h terminal pulse. Remarkably, O-2A progenitors were the only cell type for which the increased percentage of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells from demyelinated tissue was highly significant (4 wpi; demyelinated = 38.3 %, control = Figure 8 .

Bar, 50 ttm. 0%; p = 0.027, as determined by paired two-tailed t test). Approximately 12-14% of each of the other O-2A lineage cell types (oligodendrocytes, type 2 astrocytes, and mixed phenotype cells) were pH]thymidine-labeled in cultures derived from demyelinated tissue. Although the percentage of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells within each of these phenotypes alone was not increased significantly, when combined as a single group these three phenotypes accounted for a significant proliferative response in cultures of demyelinated tissue (4 wpi; demyelinated = 13.5 %, control = 4.3 %; p = 0.029, as determined by paired two-tailed t test). Thus the in vivo proliferative response of O-2A lineage cells isolated from demyelinating tissues was retained in vitro.",

The relative abundance of type 2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in spinal cord cultures from virus-inoculated animals. The number of type 2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes was determined as described in Fig. 5 . In defined media alone, the proportion of type 2 astrocytes increases during demyelination (3-5 wpi). Addition of bFGF (10 ng/nd) to the defined media between 1 and 3 div exaggerates this shift toward the type 2 astrocyte phenotype by decreasing the relative number of cells expressing GC. Treatment with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) induces a larger proportion of cells to express the oligodendrocyte phenotype. Exogenous PDGF (10 ng/ml) did not alter the ratio of type 2 astxo~tes to oligodendrocytes. To minimize variability between experiments, the cultures were prepared in parallel for each timepoint and as one completely matched set from mice inoculated at the same time with the demyelinating virus. Each value represents the ratio from cell counts in an entire 35-mm dish. A total of 1,793 cells were counted in the set of cultures. To estimate the variability that might be expected between nonmatched experiments, the ratio of type 2 astrocytes to oligodendrocytes was compared in three similar experiments of cultures grown without exogenous growth factors. The asterisks denote values which fall outside of a 95 % confidence interval of the expected variability between experiments for cultures grown without exogenous growth factors. Fig. 1, A and B) .

Significance values were determined using the two-tailed paired t test. Studies of neonatal CNS tissue have shown that the growth and differentiation of O-2A lineage cells can be influenced in vitro by several polypeptide growth factors, which are synthesized in the brain (for review, see Raft, 1989; Dubois-Dalcq and Armstrong, 1990) .

A type 2 astroeyte cultured from demyelinated tissue (4 wpi) and processed as described in Fig. 10 is identified by the presence of surface staining with 04 (A; rhodamine optics), intracellular expression of GFAP (B; coumarin optics) and the absence of labeling with GC antibody (C; fluoreseein optics). The cluster of silver grains over the nucleus (D, arrow) indicates that this cell incorporated [3H]thymidine during the 20-h in vitro pulse. (E) Phase contrast showing the cell processes.

Human oligodendrocytes isolated from normal adult brain do not proliferate in response to treatment with several growth factors, including PDGF, FGF, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin 2 (Yong et al., 1988) . Similarly, in the present study we found that PDGF, bFGF, or IGF-I did not induce mitosis of O-2A lineage cells cultured from adult mice, as assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. However, a factor secreted by B104 neuroblastoma cells is mitogenic for O-2A progenitors and oligodendrocytes cultured from adult rat brain (Hunter et al., 1988) . Thus, normal adult O-2A lineage cells are capable of proliferating when exposed to an adequate stimulus. Such a stimulus could be a factor (or factors) released in the CNS during demyelination since O-2A lineage cells in the spinal cord of MHV-A59 infected mice showed increased proliferation both in vivo (Godfraind et al., 1989) and in vitro (the present data). Interestingly, some growth factors can influence the antigenic phenotypes of O-2A lineage cells in our cultures of demyelinating/remyelinating CNS. Basic FGF decreased the percentage of O-2A lineage cells expressing GC, whereas IGF-I increased the proportion of oligodendrocytes relative to type 2 astrocytes. Thus bFGF and IGF-I might modulate phenotype expression in CNS development and remyelination.",

In our in vivo studies of remyelination following coronavirus-induced demyelination in mice, we have used in situ hybridization and immunolabeling techniques to analyze the expression of myelin genes and the presence of cell-type-specific antigens in oligodendrocytes and their precursors (Jordan et al., 1989; Godfraind et al., 1989) . We found that myelin basic protein mRNA isoforms containing exon-2, which are normally abundant only during development, are reexpressed at dramatically increased levels during remyelination (Jordan et al., 1990) . This recapitulation of molecular events characteristic of development suggests that newly generated oligodendrocytes are responsible for remyelination in this disease. Studies using triple-label immunocytochemistry combined with autoradiography have identified O-2A progenitor cells in 1 ~m frozen sections of the spinal cord of these infected mice (Godfraind et al., 1989) .

            "text": "In the present study, we demonstrate that the mitotic activity of O-2A lineage cells observed in vivo during demyelination has been maintained in vitro. This proliferation might be mediated by factors active in the culture milieu or by signals experienced in vivo which persist in vitro. The nature of the signal(s) triggering this proliferation is presently unknown. Reactive astrocytes may secrete mitogenic factors while microglia can synthesize lymphokines in response to trauma (Giulian, 1987; Giulian et al., 1988) . Since microglial cells are present in our cultures of adult spinal cord and are much more prevalent in cultures of demyelinated tissue, it is possible that O-2A lineage cells proliferate due to factors released into the culture milieu by these cells. In addition to soluble factors, denuded axons or axolemmal components, which are mitogenic for oligodendrocytes from developing CNS (Chen and DeVries, 1989), may act as mitogens for O-2A lineage cells during demyelination. Denuded axons in demyelinated lesions may stimulate proliferation directly, or may \"prime\" O-2A lineage cells to divide in response to specific growth factors. Previous studies have shown that oligodendrocytes isolated from adult spinal cord and expressing GC, but not myelin basic protein, can divide in the presence of neurons (Wood and Bunge, 1986) . Along with O-2A progenitors, oligodendrocytes expressing GC also proliferated in our cultures from remyelinating animals. Thus, proliferating oligodendrocytes could also be a major source of remyelinating cells. Type 2 astrocytes and cells with a mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype also proliferated in response to demyelination. Cells with characteristics of both o l i~ and astrocyte phenotypes have been described in several in vivo studies of demyelinating tissue (Bunge et al., 1961; Carrollet al., 1987; Godfralnd et al., 1989; Paine, 1989) . Additionally, ciliary neurotrophic factor, which induces transient GFAP expression in neonatal O-2A progenitors in vitro, is much more abundant in regenerating CNS tissue (Nieto-Sampedro et al., 1983) and might possibly induce a mixed phenotype in vivo. The presence of phenotypic characteristics of both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in the same cell indicates that some degree of plasticity is possible between these two differentiation pathways. Mixed phenotype cells might be precursor cells at an intermediate bipotential stage which are responding to two differentiation signals simultaneously, or may be mature cells in a state of transdifferentiation between astrocyte and oligodendrocyte phenotypes. By either mechanism, mixed phenotype cells might provide additional ways to increase the number of oligodendrocytes available for remyelination. Now that we have established and characterized an in vitro system of glial cells derived from normal and demyelinating/remyelinating adult CNS, we can design future experiments to determine which of the proliferating cells provide new oligodendrocytes in remyelination and which factors enhance this pathway. Since we have recently developed a similar in vitro system from adult human CNS (Dorn et al., 1990) , such experiments could also be performed with human oligodendrocyte lineage cells. The study of the growth and differentiation properties of the glial cell types involved in remyelination may lead to the elaboration of strategies to promote remyelination in human demyelinating diseases.",

Several differences were observed between the glial cell populations isolated from control and demyelinated spinal cords. First, the number of O-2A lineage cells (oligodendrocytes, O-2A progenitors, type 2 astrocytes, and mixed phenotype cells combined) increased dramatically as demyelination progressed and returned to near control levels as remyelination proceeded. Moreover, O-2A lineage cells derived from demyelinated tissue differed from those of control tissue by the presence of mixed oligodendrocyte-astrocyte phenotype cells and by their differentiation potential in response to exogenous growth factors. Finally, both in vivo and in vitro [3H]thymidine labeling demonstrated enhanced proliferation of O-2A lineage cells derived from demyeli-nated tissue, which correlates well with the increased number of O-2A lineage cells observed in culture. The phenotypic plasticity and mitotic potential O-2A lineage cells cultured from demyelinating/remyelinating tissue may refleet molecular and cellular events critical for efficient remyelination in vivo.",
