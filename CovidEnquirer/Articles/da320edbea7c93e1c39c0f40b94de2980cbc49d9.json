Depending on the way ferrets are raised by their keepers and on individual characteristics, ferrets may be very quiet and relaxed, or inquisitive, stubborn, and even aggressive. In most cases, an ophthalmic examination can be performed by physically restraining the ferret. The common way of restraining ferrets during medical activities is called scruffing and consists of holding the skin on the back of the neck (Fig. 1) . Depending on the desired positioning, ferrets may be held on a flat surface or in the air in the so-called hanging position. 1 Holding the back of the neck permits the operators to control the head of the ferret, preventing accidental bites. Also, some ferrets become completely immobile when restrained in this manner.",

            "text": "An alternative to physical restraint is chemical restraint. Chemical restraint is rarely required for a simple ophthalmic examination, including intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, but may be needed if more invasive diagnostic procedures are performed or if the ferret is especially aggressive. 2 Because specific literature on the effects of most anesthetic drugs on the ocular parameters of ferrets is lacking, effects similar to those demonstrated in other domestic animals should be assumed. For noninvasive ophthalmic testing procedures, the use of midazolam or butorphanol alone is sufficient. The suggested dose for midazolam or butorphanol that provides relaxation sufficient for ophthalmic testing is 0.2 mg/kg intramuscularly for either drug. This is the minimal dose that allows blood pressure measurement from 10 to 20 minutes postinjection in all ferrets, with no side-effects noted except minimal hypothermia. 3 After the ferret is properly restrained, examination can be accomplished with a combination of direct and oblique illumination of the eye. A direct ophthalmoscope is an excellent tool to examine the corneal surface, as is a transilluminator focused on the eyelid and then used at a 90 angle to illuminate the cornea from the side. This technique backlights the cornea somewhat and helps localize abnormalities to the corneal surface. A normal ferret eye is pictured in Fig. 2 . Regular ophthalmic diagnostics are also recommended. Schirmer tear tests are cumbersome in the small eye of the ferret but can be accomplished. Normal values have been published as 5.31 mm/min plus or minus 1.32 mm. 4 Fluorescein stain can be used to evaluate for corneal defects by placing a wetted strip to the sclera or a drop of mixed fluorescein solution on the cornea. Rinsing may be necessary to determine true stain uptake. IOP readings are published for the applanation tonometer Tono-Pen (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY) as 14 mm Hg plus or minus 3.27 mm Hg. 4 The TonoVet (Icare, Finland, Oy), a rebound tonometer well-suited to the small size of the ferret eye, has published normal values of 14.07 mm Hg plus or minus 0.35. 2 When applanation and rebound tonometers were compared in the same ferret population, there was poor agreement between these instruments (95% of the results differed between \u00c020.8 and 123.8 mm Hg) and applanation tonometry was less consistent. Multiple factors need to be accounted for in ferrets when measuring IOP because a difference between male and female sex, and a circadian trend (with lower IOP found at night) have been found. 2",

            "text": "Ferrets housed with improper bedding can develop a conjunctivitis caused by dust and debris. 5 This conjunctivitis is bilateral and accompanied by the presence of debris in the tear film. This can be appreciated by illuminating the eye from the side and looking for irregularity on the corneal surface, followed by fluorescein staining to rule out corneal ulceration. Conjunctivitis has also been reported in association with systemic disease. Most notably, canine distemper presents with ocular signs early in the course of the disease. 6 Canine distemper in the early catarrhal phase is characterized by conjunctivitis, anorexia, fever, and nasal discharge. 7 Ferrets with canine distemper will progress to a pruritic rash followed by hyperkeratosis of the footpads. 8 The disease has poor prognosis and early identification is helpful for patient isolation and client communication (Fig. 3) . 7 Human influenza virus infection can mimic canine distemper virus conjunctivitis and should be considered as a rule-out. 7, 9, 10 Salmonellosis, a notable zoonosis, can present with conjunctivitis, lethargy, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and pale mucous membranes. 11, 12 Diagnosis is made by positive fecal culture. 12 Mycobacterium infection can result in prominent conjunctival lesions in the disseminated form. 13 A retrospective study of mycobacterial infection in ferrets showed 3 characteristics: eyelid lesions, upper or lower respiratory and gastrointestinal signs, and digestive symptoms. 14 The eyelid lesions in these reports included unilateral or bilateral swelling, edema, or abscess or elevation of the third eyelid, without conjunctival or corneal lesions, which failed to respond to topical antibiotic or steroid treatment. 14 In another report, an affected ferret presented with a proliferative lesion on the third eyelid, whereas another presented with conjunctival swelling and serous ocular discharge. 15 Other clinical signs were vague and included cough, weight loss, and depression. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the bacteria with cytologic evaluation of conjunctival swabs or histopathologic evaluation of conjunctival biopsies. 13 Distichiasis, causing epiphora, chronic blepharospasm, and conjunctivitis, has been reported in a ferret. 16 This ferret responded well to surgical treatment of the aberrant cilia with sharp excision of the hair follicle. Chronic ocular discomfort and discharge is an indication for close examination of the eyelid margins for abnormal hairs.",
