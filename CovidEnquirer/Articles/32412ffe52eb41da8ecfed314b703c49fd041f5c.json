            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases and is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given that the prevalence of COPD increases with age, the perspective is that the impact of the disease will continue to increase in the near future. According to the World Health Organization, in 2005, COPD affected 210 million people, of whom 3 million died from the disease. 1 More recently, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that, in 2010, COPD was the third leading cause of death globally and ninth in disabilityadjusted life years. 2, 3 A great part of this mortality in COPD occurs during exacerbations and the subsequent weeks, especially in patients hospitalized for severe exacerbations. 4, 5 for exacerbation of their disease over a period of 3 years. 6 In addition, these hospitalizations generate the majority of health care costs and cause a significant deterioration in quality of life for affected patients. 6, 7 Factors associated with an increased risk of hospitalization include a prior history of admissions for COPD exacerbation, older age, severe pulmonary functional impairment, and the presence of comorbidities. 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] Recently, two publications based on data obtained in the TORCH and POET trials, (two large international studies involving over 13,000 patients) investigated the relationship between exacerbations and seasonality, and confirmed an increase in exacerbations during the winter months along with an increase in hospitalizations, although this association was not observed in the tropics. 12, 13 Both studies were performed by comparing seasons, and therefore only indirectly dealt with temperatures. There are few studies directly assessing the influence of temperature in exacerbations of COPD, especially in more severe cases, such as those requiring hospitalization.",

Given the climate diversity in Catalonia, Spain, and in order to homogenize the sample according to temperature, we selected only those pertaining to Barcelona and its metropolitan area (600 km 2 and 3,000,000 inhabitants) with a homogeneous Mediterranean climate characterized by moderate temperatures with mild winters, hot summers, and a variable climate during spring and autumn. Regions with a Mediterranean climate are found between 31 and 40 degrees latitude north and south of the equator, on the western side of continents, and include areas of southern and southwestern Australia, central Chile, coastal California, the Western Cape of South Africa, and around the Mediterranean Sea. Since the temperature is usually a few degrees higher in the large cities than in the surrounding areas (urban heat island effect), we also compared the number of admissions and temperatures in the city of Barcelona with the rest of the metropolitan area.",

The data collected included mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures, along with humidity and precipitation. In order to decrease the noise, these values were considered by weekly means. In addition, to compare our results with those published in the TORCH and POET trials, the numbers of hospitalizations for COPD were also stratified by month and seasonality. Seasons were defined as follows: winter (December to February), spring (March to May), summer (June to August), and autumn (September to November). 12, 13 The rate of respiratory infections was obtained using data collected in the information plan for acute respiratory infections in Catalonia (PIDIRAC). 15 The PIDIRAC data are part of the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme, pertaining to the European Centre for Disease and Control, and its methodology is similar throughout Europe. 16 Briefly, the PIDIRAC receives information from a sentinel network of primary care and pediatric physicians who collect the number of ambulatory consultations and home visits for influenza-like illness, with a collection of the first two weekly respiratory samples by nasal and pharyngeal swabs for viral detection by immunofluorescence or viral polymerase chain reaction. All hospitalizations for influenzalike illness were also studied for respiratory samples, and all positive cases for influenza virus were notified. ",

For example, a recent metaanalysis concerning the relationship between climate and cardiorespiratory morbidity found only three studies that examined the effect of cold in these pathologies. 19 In another study performed in Copenhagen, the authors found a higher prevalence of hospitalizations for respiratory causes in the warmest months. 20 These data are similar to a Canadian study that found an association between colder temperatures and cardiovascular diseases but not with respiratory diseases. 21 In contrast, studies that have specifically analyzed COPD exacerbations show that numbers increase in the winter months, including the number of hospitalizations for exacerbation of COPD. 22 Recently, two publications based on the TORCH and POET trials indicated that the numbers of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations in winter were almost double those in summer, which is in agreement with our study. Regrettably, both studies were only able to perform the analysis stratified by month and seasonality, and therefore only indirectly considered ambient temperature, due to a lack of climate data analysis. 12, 13 There are very few studies about the role of temperature in the number and severity of COPD exacerbations. A study performed in Bavaria, Germany, showed an increase of 1% ",

            "text": "Temperature and hospitalizations for COPD in outpatient visits for COPD for each Fahrenheit degree decrease. 23 These results are similar to those of two other studies done in Taiwan, which found an increase of 0.8% in outpatient consultations for COPD exacerbations for each 1\u00b0C decrease in temperature and an increment of emergency room consultations in the colder months. 24, 25 Our data yield similar conclusions in a different climate and with more severe exacerbations, since it is centered on hospital admissions. Finally, a population-based study in Scotland confirmed an increase in hospital admissions for COPD with a decrease in monthly temperatures, especially in groups of lower socioeconomic status. 26 Other studies link diurnal temperature range with emergency room visits for cardiovascular disease or mortality from COPD. [27] [28] [29] [30] The reasons for the increase in exacerbations with cold temperatures are complex and not entirely elucidated. The most plausible explanation is that the increase in viral infections acts as a trigger for exacerbation. It is well known that virus alone or associated with bacterial infection is present in around two thirds of COPD exacerbations. The most common virus is the human rhinovirus causing the common cold, which can be found in more than 50% of exacerbations, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and others. 30, 31 Viral infections lead to increased basal inflammation being present in the airways of patients with COPD. 34 Most respiratory viral infections in the northern and southern regions of the world have a seasonal pattern not observed in the tropics, and they have been associated with low temperatures, humidity, variations in patient physiology, and changes in social behavior. 30 These respiratory infections are more common in winter, both in COPD patients and in the general population, and occur in a wide range of climates, being more closely related to temperature variations than to absolute temperatures. Recent research suggests that human rhinovirus infections, at least in children, are more severe in winter. 34 Another possible explanation for the increased number of hospitalizations for COPD in winter is the decline in lung function with the cold, and the increased airway inflammation and longer duration of exacerbation experienced by COPD patients with decreasing temperatures. [35] [36] [37] [38] Our study confirms the low impact of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 on the number of hospitalizations for COPD. The pandemic in 2009 affected predominantly the young population, probably because of residual immunity in the elderly from previous antigenically similar virus exposure. 39 Only 10% of patients hospitalized for influenza A in Catalonia in 2009 had a diagnosis of COPD. 15 Other factors associated with an increase in COPD exacerbations in some studies are low humidity and higher air pollution levels, although their role appears less relevant than that of falling temperatures, and in our study their significance disappeared after adjustment for temperature. 23, 30, 31, [40] [41] [42] Our study has some limitations. First, the collected data about the number of COPD admissions were based on hospital discharge codes, so we cannot rule out errors inherent in coding or data not collected with the etiology of the exacerbation. The definition of discharge codes based on ICD-9 is used in all previous studies using this methodology and their accuracy has been validated in several studies. 43, 44 This limitation is common to all studies performed with the same methodology, and is partially compensated for by the large sample size. 5 Additionally, our population was very similar in terms of sex, age, and length of stay to that reported in prospective cohort studies conducted in the same area. 10, 45 In conclusion, our study demonstrates an independent relationship between ambient temperature and the number of hospital admissions for COPD exacerbation even after adjustment for humidity, comorbidity, influenza syndromes, and air pollution.",
