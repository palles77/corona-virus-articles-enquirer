The circumstances that would facilitate events of low probability may be highly prevalent, which increases the public health importance of such potential events. Modern travel and transportation links would distribute a new human-transmissible influenza strain worldwide within days and overwhelm most healthcare systems within weeks. Preventing such an event is a vital public health enterprise.",

Domestic animal and human avian influenza infection may therefore increase reassortment opportunities and the chance of a potentially pandemic strain emerging.",

Most human avian influenza infections occur among persons working or living with domesticated birds (6) . Traditional Asian wet markets provide major contact points for people and live animal mixing (because of lack of refrigeration, animals are usually alive when sold), making them important potential sources of viral amplification and infection (7) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus probably emerged from the selling in wet markets of Himalayan palm civets and other wild species. Traditional local demand for live animals from wet markets maintains this practice. In the wet markets of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, <10 chickens are enclosed in small (approximately 25 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm) plastic cages in stacks of 5. Distressed chickens defecate, which contaminates feathers with feces. Frequent cleaning of cages and transportation and storage areas does not prevent this. Although direct hand-to-face contact is the most likely path for infection, the flapping by distressed chickens inverted during inspection by shoppers raises fecal-dust aerosols and exposes sellers, shoppers, and passers-by to any virus particles on an infected bird. Highly dense urban populations maximize opportunities for infection and transmission in any outbreak.",

A highly conservative estimation assumes that genetic reassortment of human and avian influenza viruses can occur only on day l of a 5-day infectious period (16) in a person with human influenza. During the two 10-week human influenza seasons that occur annually in Hong Kong (17, 18) , sentinel data for ILI 1998-2004 indicate that peak population infection rates (p i ) average 10% (\u00b150% lower and upper bound estimates, i.e., 5%-15%), giving 0.2 \u00d7 (4,220,738/52) \u00d7 20 \u00d7 p i = 32,467 (16, 700 ) episodes when persons on day 1 of a human influenza infection face exposure to live chickens. Wet markets amplify viral loads (19) . Before the enactment in 2003 of wet market \"rest days,\" H5N1 isolates occurred in \u224810% of chickens for sale in Hong Kong (20) . Because all live chickens available in Hong Kong are vaccinated against avian influenza and the vaccine is presumed 90% effective (1, 21) , then only 1% (10% of 10% carrier rate) are potentially avian influenza infected, giving 325 (162-487) day 1 potential coinfection exposures when reassortment could occur, a rate of 0.0077% (0.0038-0.0115%). Influenza produces no symptoms for 24 to 48 hours after infection so shopping rates would be unaffected. Assuming that 50% of persons shop on day 1 of infection reduces the figure by half to 162 (81-243) coinfection exposures annually. Among the 11% who touch the chickens, risk for avian influenza infection is likely greater. These estimates, though highly uncertain, quantify the potential risk magnitudes involved. These 4.2 million exposures provide substantial opportunity for chicken-to-human transmission in Hong Kong wet markets. Elsewhere in Asia, exposure events are likely even more common for 2 reasons. First, persons born outside Hong Kong and China touch chickens more frequently. Second, most other Southeast Asian countries have endemic avian influenza infections and have not implemented intense surveillance, widespread inoculation of imported chickens, or both, or monthly market rest days to reduce viral load in markets.",
