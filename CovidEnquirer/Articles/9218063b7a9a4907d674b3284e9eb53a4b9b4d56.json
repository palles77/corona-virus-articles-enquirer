            "text": "The appearance and spread of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) raise concern of a possible pandemic. Current preventive measures include the development of a pre-pandemic influenza vaccine and stockpiling of neuraminidase inhibitors. However, their benefits can be significantly reduced by mutations in the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase resulting in antigenic changes and the appearance of drug-resistance, respectively. Drugs that target the innate immune system to achieve a 'heightened antiviral' state represent another class of antiviral agents that could contribute to the control and treatment of influenza infection. In this study, PIKA (a stabilized dsRNA) provides broad-spectrum prophylaxis against a number of influenza A viruses. In addition, when PIKA was admixed with influenza vaccine preparations, including a formalin-inactivated whole-virion H5 vaccine, significant adjuvanting effect leading to accelerated viral clearance was observed in a murine model. These biological effects appear to be mediated by the ability of PIKA to promote the maturation of dendritic cells, including up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, and the induction of various cytokines and chemokines. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) was shown to recognize PIKA in a concentration-dependent manner. The potency and versatility in its activities make PIKA an attractive candidate for use in an influenza pandemic.",

            "text": "The most effective tool for controlling an influenza pandemic is a suitable vaccine. For optimal effectiveness, the pandemic vaccine needs to be based on the causative strain and therefore, vaccine cannot be produced until the pandemic strain is identified. This criterion poses serious constraints in the capability of vaccine manufacturers to prepare pandemic vaccines in advance for stockpiles. In addition, a number of studies have shown that the hemagglutinin (HA) molecules of avian H5 viruses are poorly immunogenic [1, 2] , where up to 90 g of antigen (6 times the normal dose of human influenza virus HA) was required to elicit potentially protective responses in a substantial number of subjects [2] . This need for a larger antigen dose further reduces the availability of the 'limited' pandemic vaccines. In an attempt to increase the immunogenicity of the antigen, adjuvants like alum and MF-59 have been incorporated into vaccine formulations. Although alum may enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to a high dose of antigen, it does not have significant antigen-sparing effect [3, 4] . Other adju-vants, such as MF59 or a proprietary oil emulsion adjuvant, have been tested and data indicate that the inclusion of these adjuvants in the vaccine preparation would significantly increase antibody titers [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Given the likelihood that a suitable vaccine will not be available before the onset of a pandemic, initial protection in a pandemic may have to rely on antiviral treatment and prophylaxis. Currently available anti-influenza drugs include neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) or ion-channel blockers (adamantanes). The success of these drugs, both for prophylaxis or therapeutics, is based on the susceptibility of the viruses to these drugs. Recently reported studies, however, have shown that a number of H5 isolates are resistant to these drugs [7] [8] [9] . These drugs or classes of drugs alone may thus be insufficient in protecting the human population from an influenza pandemic. An alternative, antigen-independent approach that could slow down the transmission of the virus and provide more time for vaccine production is thus highly desirable.",

            "text": "The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a collection of receptors that detect conserved molecular components encoded by microorganisms (reviewed in Refs. [10, 11] ) and stimulation of these receptors by specific ligands leads to the activation of the innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DC), macrophages and NK cells [12, 13] , through a variety of signaling pathways, such as NF-B transcription factors, c-Jun NH2 terminal kinase (Jnk), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), resulting in quantitative and qualitative changes in immunological functions, including antigen presentation. In addition, cytokines, such as IFN-\u2423, TNF-\u2423 and IL-12p40, are produced in vivo shortly after TLR activation [13, 14] . The production of these cytokines results in antiviral effects observed in a number of infection models. For example, administration of synthetic lipid A analogs (TLR4 agonists) protects mice against an influenza challenge [15] . A possible explanation for this anti-influenza effect could be related to the production of type 1 interferons, which induce the activation of IFN-stimulated genes including Mx proteins, protein kinase R and 2 5' oligoadenylate synthetase [16] . The induction of these proteins increases the resistance to the replication of the influenza virus [17] [18] [19] .",

Our results show that PIKA has potent anti-influenza effect when administered 6 h prior to or immediately after influenza virus challenge in mice. The antiviral effect is not strain-specific. When used as an immuno-adjuvant, PIKA was able to achieve significant antigen-sparing effect. When incubated with immature DC, PIKA altered the expression pattern of a number of immune genes. In addition, PIKA was capable of interacting with both human and mouse TLR3, leading to the production of NF-B. Thus, in the face of a potential influenza pandemic, PIKA could be a candidate as a prophylactic drug or could be used as an adjuvant to increase the population coverage when pandemic vaccines become available.",

To examine this, mice were given different concentrations of PIKA i.n. and were challenged with 50 PFU of PR8 virus i.n. The mice were treated at 24 and 48 h and were sacrificed on day 3. A dose-dependent response was observed (Fig. 1B) , in which mice given 100 g of PIKA daily had the lowest mean viral titer among all the groups. An inhibitory effect of PIKA on viral replication was detected at 10 g per dose but not at 1 g per dose (p = 0.0556). To determine whether PIKA could be used as a treatment option at the time of infection, mice were given PIKA immediately after infection with 50 PFU of PR8 virus. As shown in Fig. 1C , this treatment protocol was effective in reducing the pulmonary viral titer and the titer was not significantly different from the prophylaxis group that received PIKA 6 h prior to infection (p = 0.1508). However, it is apparent that daily treatment is preferable because the group that received only a single dose had a significantly higher titer of virus in the lungs compared to those that received daily doses (p = 0.0159). Intranasal administration of PIKA produced the most significant anti-influenza effect compared to s.c. or i.p. administration of the drug (Fig. 1D ) though the pul-monary viral titers in the treated mice were still significantly lower than the titers of the PBS control group (p = 0.0079).",

We sought to demonstrate that the enhancement of the humoral responses would lead to significant viral reduction in replication of challenge virus. Previous studies have showed that when administrated at between 1.5 and 5 g per dose, different forms of influenza vaccine could induce robust antibody responses without any external adjuvant [27] [28] [29] with protection against viral challenge [27] . As shown in Fig. 4A , mice immunized with a single dose of the trivalent vaccine at 1.5 g s.c. had robust antibody responses which were comparable to those induced when the vaccine was admixed with CFA. When the vaccine dose was reduced by 10- fold (0.15 g) , there was about 10-fold reduction in the mag-nitude of the antibody responses. To mimic a vaccine shortage situation, a dose of 0.015 g, (\u223c100-fold reduction from the optimal dose) was selected and we evaluated whether the inclusion of PIKA could compensate for the reduction in antigen concentration. Groups of five mice were vaccinated with a suboptimal dose of Fluvax vaccine by the s.c. or i.n. route. Three weeks after priming, sera were collected from the mice before they were boosted. Sera were collected from the mice 3 weeks after boost. As shown Fig. 4 . PIKA acts as a potent adjuvant by enhancing the immunogenicity of the seasonal influenza vaccine. (A) Groups of four mice were vaccinated with either 50 or 5 L of Fluvax influenza vaccine (containing 1.5 or 0.15 g of HA from each subtype) in PBS or in CFA by the subcutaneous route. On day 21, sera were collected and the antibody titer of the sera was determined by an ELISA assay, using Fluvax as the coating antigen. (B) Groups of five mice were vaccinated with 0.5 L of Fluvax influenza vaccine (containing 15 ng of HA from each subtype) in PBS, either by the subcutaneous route at the base of the tail or by the intranasal route. Some groups received the vaccine with additional adjuvant as indicated in the X-axis. For those that received PIKA as an adjuvant, 100 g of PIKA was admixed with the vaccine prior to administration. On day 21 post-vaccination, sera were collected and the mice received another boost by the same route and sera were collected on day 42. The antibody titer of the sera was determined by an ELISA assay, using Fluvax as the coating antigen. Each dot represents the antibody titer of an individual mouse. The primary and secondary antibody titers are represented by the black and red dots respectively and the lines represent the geometric mean antibody titer of each group. The '*' symbol indicates that the difference between two groups is statistically significant (p < 0.05). (C) To determine the level of protection mediated by the antibody response, the mice were challenged with 50 PFU of PR8 intranasally 3 weeks after the boosting and the pulmonary viral titer was determined on day 5 post-infection. Closed circles represent the lung virus titer of an individual mouse and the line represents the geometric mean titer of the group of mice. The percent reduction in mean viral titer relative to the PBS control group is shown above each column of data. The '*' symbol indicates that the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). (D) Serum samples were diluted 1:2000 and the avidity of the antibodies was tested in a urea-displacement ELISA. The O.D. of the urea-treated plates was expressed as a percent of the untreated plates. Data are represented as the mean and standard derivation of five mice.",

We therefore proceeded to examine whether PIKA was an effective adjuvant for an H5N1 vaccine. Groups of five mice were inoculated by the s.c. route with a formalin-inactivated H5 vaccine, with or without an adjuvant, and 3 weeks later, sera were collected to determine the antibody titer against the virus. As shown in Fig. 5A , the whole-virion vaccine was capable of inducing a measurable titer of antibody after one dose. However, with the inclusion of PIKA, there was a \u223c3-fold increase in antibody titer (p = 0.0157), and this was comparable to the titer achieved in the group that received the vaccine with CFA. When challenged with the homologous virus i.n., however, this group of mice was the only group which showed significant reduction in pulmonary titer on day 5 pi (Fig. 5B, p = 0.0079) . The efficacy was further boosted by a second dose of H5 vaccine with PIKA. Mice in this group showed a further 1000-fold reduction in viral titer (Fig. 5C ). In addition, the vaccine-PIKA formulation was efficacious in reducing viral replication even when the vaccine was delivered intranasally. In contrast, in the absence of PIKA, the vaccine administered by the i.n. route failed to induce a significant reduction in viral titer compared with the PBS control (p = 0.2492).",

Using primary immature DC culture, D1 cells, we examined how DC responded to PIKA stimulation in vitro. PIKA was added into DC cultures for 16 h following which total RNA was extracted from the cells. The expression level of more than 1000 immunologically related genes between PIKA-stimulated and unstimulated samples were compared using microarray technology. As shown in Fig. 7A , PIKA-stimulated DCs up-regulated expression of a number of cellular activation markers, such as CD80 and CD86 compared to unstimulated cells. A number of genes that have important immunological functions were also found to be up-regulated after PIKA treatment, including IRF-7 (interferon regulatory factor 7), IL-1, IL-15, IL-6 and IL-12 receptor. Many chemokines, such as MIP (macrophage inflammatory protein), Rantes, MCP-2 (macrophage chemoattractant protein) and IP-10 (interferon gamma inducible protein) were also found to have increased expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm these findings. Using cDNA from unstimulated DC as the baseline, many genes were up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B) . While certain genes, such as iNos and IL-12, were up-regulated to a comparable level in LPSstimulated DC, other genes, such as CD40L, MIP3 and IFN-\u2425, were up-regulated more readily by PIKA stimulation. To demonstrate that the observed changes in gene expression lead to changes in these cytokines/chemokines, the level of these proteins in the culture supernatants was measured. Consistent with the up-regulation of cytokine/chemokines genes, there was an increase in the production of these cytokines/chemokines in the supernatant from PIKA-stimulated DC compared with those from the unstimulated DC (Fig. 7C ).",

Most human cases to date involve close contact with infected poultry and human-to-human transmission remains limited [35] . Nonetheless, the lack of anti-H5 immunity in humans, together with the continuous evolution of the virus in close proximity with the human population, threatens a pandemic. Should the virus acquire the property of efficient transmissibility between humans, in combination with the high case-fatality rate resulting from infection, this virus has the potential of causing an influenza pandemic with damage on a scale similar to that achieved by the 1918 'Spanish' flu pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective prophylaxis and therapeutic strategies in preparation for a possible pandemic.",

This effect is unlikely to be due to a direct antiviral activity, because pre-incubating influenza virus with PIKA did not inhibit virus infectivity for embryonated chicken eggs (Lynn Tang, unpublished data). Instead, PIKA appears to act by stimulating the innate immune system (Fig. 7) , resulting in the production of several chemokines, cytokines and interferons and these, in turn, mediate the observed antiviral activity. Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins, protein kinase R and 2'5' oligoadenylate synthetase are some of the products that have been reported to be up-regulated after type 1 interferon production (reviewed in Ref.

Furthermore, as PIKA does not target a specific component of the virion for its antiviral activity, it is likely to be effective against multiple strains and subtypes of influenza viruses as demonstrated in this study. This broad-spectrum activity is not limited to influenza A viruses only. A number of studies have shown that TLR-ligands are capable of inhibiting a wide range of viruses, including herpes simplex virus-2 [37] , cytomegalovirus [38] , parainfluenza [39] , West Nile virus [40] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARs-CoV) [41] and influenza virus [42, 43] . The abovementioned advantages make this novel antiviral approach a compelling alternative to traditional antiviral drugs and vaccines especially since avian influenza viruses have rapidly developed resistance to antiviral drugs [44] and some mutant viruses can maintain drug-resistance without losing virulence [45] . In addition, Thitithanyanont et al. showed that stimulating DC with Poly(I:C) conferred the cells with resistance to the cytopathic effects of H5N1 virus which might be important for the induction of virus-specific immune responses during the infection [46] .",

PIKA induces maturation of dendritic cells, with expression of a wide range of immunological genes. Immature murine dendritic cells, D1 cells, were incubated with 500 g per mL of PIKA or were unstimulated overnight. (A) Total RNA was harvested from the cells and converted into cDNA.

Each gene target was printed 4 times on the array and the normalized mean Cy5/Cy3 ratio and coefficient of variation (cv) of the four replicates were determined by the software.

We explored the concept further by demonstrating that a substantial antigen-sparing effect could be achieved by incorporating PIKA into vaccines. Using the commercial split vaccine, the antigensparing effect was about 100-fold ( Fig. 4A and B) . Furthermore, we demonstrated that the augmented humoral response led to a func-tional reduction in viral titer (Fig. 4C ). Our data also showed that successful immunization could be achieved by a non-parenteral route. With two doses, the magnitude of the response achieved by intranasal immunization was comparable to that achieved by subcutaneous immunization and was associated with a similar level of viral clearance. Our finding is consistent with the report from Ichinohe et al. [29] in which they showed that another TLR3 ligand, Ampligen, was capable of enhancing the immunogenicity of a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine when administrated intranasally. In their study, the enhancement effect was demonstrated using a higher dose of the trivalent vaccine (1 g) and in this current study, we extended the observation further by showing that similar enhancement effect can be achieved even when the concentration of the immunogen was reduced to 0.045 g (22-fold lower). The antigen-sparing effect of PIKA might be an important strategy for maximizing vaccine coverage when vaccine supplies are limited. It is of interest to note that although the group that received the influenza vaccine with PIKA did not have the highest antibody titer, it had the lowest pulmonary viral titer (a 10-fold reduction compared with the CFA adjuvant vaccine group). The higher avidity of the antibodies induced by the vaccine with PIKA might allow more effective inhibition of viral replication in vivo which translated into lower pulmonary viral titers as observed in this study. This suggests that in addition to augmenting the amount of antibody produced, PIKA may also have an impact on the quality of the humoral responses, such as affinity maturation [47, 48] .",

            "text": "Because PIKA is a stabilized form of double stranded (ds) RNA that lacks direct anti-influenza activity, we evaluated its effect on the innate immune system in search of the mechanism underlying the observed activity. dsRNA was shown to be a ligand of TLR3 [49] and using a transient transfection system, we showed that PIKA maintained its TLR3 binding property. Incubation of PIKA with primary immature murine DC in vitro resulted in maturation of dendritic cells, with marked up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86 and cytokines with potent immunostimulatory functions such as IL-12 and IL-15. Our observation is consistent with those observed by Shen et al. with BMDC [26] . The maturation process enables DC to act as a potent antigen presenting cells for effective activation of na\u00efve lymphocytes [13, 50] , which in turn, leads to a more robust immune response. In addition, a study conducted by Perera et al. [51] showed that a vaccinia virus expressing IL-15 induced superior cellular and humoral immune responses compared to the parental strain. Therefore, the induction of IL-15 by PIKA could also have resulted in a more efficient induction of CD4 + T cell responses, translating to more robust humoral responses. Lung tissue has recently been shown to constitutively express TLR3 in vivo in mice [52] and intranasal administration of PIKA could directly stimulate these TLR-3 expressing cells, which is perhaps why PIKA worked most effectively when administrated intranasally (Fig. 1D) . We believe that PIKA will have similar antiviral activity in humans, because we showed that human TLR-3 can recognize PIKA (Fig. 6) and a number of studies have demonstrated the expression of TLR-3 in various respiratory cell types, such as nasal epithelial cells [53] , airway smooth muscle cells [54] and airway epithelial cells [55] . In addition, ds RNA was found to be the most effective TLR ligand in activating airway epithelial cells in producing IL-8 [55] . Although our experimental data are limited to TLR-3, dsRNA can also be recognized by RNA helicase, RIG-1 and MDA5, and can induce NF-B activation with type-1 IFNs [56] . It is possible that PIKA stimulates several pathways in vivo to achieve its antiviral and adjuvant activities. The knockout-mice, such as TLR3 k/o, MDA5 k/o and RIG-1 k/o mice, will be useful in shedding more light on the contribution of these receptors to the activity of PIKA.",

In a recent toxicity trial, PIKA showed no significant toxicity in mice and a phase 1 clinical study showed that the use of PIKA as an adjuvant was well-tolerated in humans without significant side-effects (Peter Brazier, unpublished data). The safety profile, together with the long shelf-life, makes PIKA an attractive complement to currently licensed antivi-ral drugs. In the early phase of an influenza pandemic, when a well-matched vaccine is unlikely to be available, PIKA can be used as an antiviral drug for temporary protection of the susceptible population, slowing down the rate of viral transmission and allowing more time for vaccine production. Furthermore, global influenza vaccine production is likely to lag well behind the demand for pandemic influenza vaccine, so the inclusion of an effective antigensparing adjuvant such as PIKA can ensure that limited supplies of vaccine achieve maximum coverage.",
