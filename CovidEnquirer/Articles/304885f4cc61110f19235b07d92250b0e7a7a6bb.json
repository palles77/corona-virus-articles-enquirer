Genetic, autoimmune, or infectious causation had partisan advocates in the past, but a multifactorial etiology is now generally accepted. Genetic factors are clearly important in multiple sclerosis, but monozygotic twins have only a 14-30% concordance, suggesting a major role for environmental factors. Assuming the pathogenesis of lesions is immunologically driven, what evokes the response remains unknown. Infections remain plausible explanations for the initiation of these responses and for the clinical and pathological features of the disease.",

A shift has occurred, however, both in methodology and goals. New methods of detection, localization, and quantitation of infectious agents are now available, and the focus of studies has shifted to known agents rather than the search for a unique \"multiple sclerosis virus.\"",

Over the subsequent 15 years, the work of Koch and Pasteur established microbial causes for many diseases. Thus, in historical perspective it is predictable that in 1884 Charcot's student and successor, Pierre Marie, proposed infections as the cause for multiple sclerosis (Marie, 1884) . Indeed, in the afterglow of Pasteur's widely hailed discovery of postexposure immunization against rabies virus, Marie prematurely predicted a vaccine would soon be available for multiple sclerosis.",

In 1957 another laboratory reported the cultivation of spirochetes from spinal fluids from patients with multiple sclerosis (Ichelson, 1957) .

Following measles and vaccinia virus infections, an acute encephalomyelitis occasionally develops that is characterized by perivenular demyelination of the brain and spinal cord. The neuroparalytic complications of rabies virus vaccines prepared in neural tissues bore a striking histopathologic resemblance to these virus-induced diseases. Thomas Rivers, the father of American virology, was intrigued by this similarity, and in the course of his studies with vaccinia virus, he inoculated monkeys with homogenates of normal neural tissue. After 6 months of repeated injections, several monkeys developed inflammatory demyelinating encephalitis simulating postinfectious encephalomyelitis and the neuroparalytic complications of rabies vaccines (Rivers and Schwentker, 1935) . This was the first induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. The subsequent claim by Schaltenbrand (1943) of transmission of multiple sclerosis to monkeys presumably represented an independent finding of this phenomenon, since the inflammation and demyelination that he induced in monkeys followed repeated injections of human neural tissue.",

The epidemiologic studies have continued to suggest an environmental factor, studies in animals and humans delineated more mechanisms by which viruses can lead to acute and chronic demyelinating diseases, and new methodologies have incriminated different groups of agents that may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

Residence after induction and at onset of disease showed no significant correlation (Beebe et al., 1967) . In a parallel case-control study of veterans of Vietnam and subsequent military service, interesting changes were found. Prevalence in women increased, prevalence in black men increased in comparison to white men, and the north-south gradient persisted but was less marked. Attenuation of the latitudinal gradient over time was also observed in the Nurses' Health Study, which assessed multiple sclerosis incidence among female nurses in the United States born between 1921 and 1946. Although the initial study demonstrated that women born north of 41-42 north latitude had a 3.5-fold higher risk of multiple sclerosis compared to women born south of 37 , there was no such association in the follow-up Nurses' Health Study II, which included nurses born between 1947 and 1964 (Hernan et al., 1999) . A systematic review of over 38 studies from Europe, Australia, and the United States also found strong evidence for a recent diminution of the latitudinal gradient (Alonso and Hernan, 2008) . Overall, these changes in gender, race, and geography over a short interval can be interpreted as strong evidence for environmental factors rather than genetic factors in the cause or precipitation of multiple sclerosis (Wallin et al., 2004) .",

The most consistent association across all populations has been with the HLA-DRB1 gene, although an increasing number of genes of modest effect are being identified through genome-wide association studies (McElroy and Oksenberg, 2011) . First-degree relatives of patients have a 3% lifetime risk. Twin studies have shown a higher concordance rate, between 14 and 25% in monozygotic twins and 2-5% in dizygotic twins (Willer et al., 2003; Hansen et al., 2005; Ristori et al., 2006) . This suggests that up to 70% of determinants may be nongenetic. Recent analysis of adoptees, half-siblings, and stepsiblings in the Canadian Network of Multiple Sclerosis Clinics showed no increase in prevalence in these family members, suggesting the environmental factor or factors were not in the familial microenvironment (Sadovnick, 2006) .

This gives the appearance of a point-source epidemic. The most unique antecedent event prior to 1943 was the 1940 occupation of the Faroes by the British, which leads to speculation that the disease was introduced by the British or their baggage. Detailed analysis showed a spatial relation between the homes of patients and the site of quartering of troops (Kurtzke, 2000) .

            "text": "The age of acquisition of an infection may influence the clinical manifestations. For example, poliomyelitis viruses seldom cause disease in infants, but cause more frequent and more severe paralysis at older ages. Thus, improved sanitation, that delays acquisition of this enteric infection, increases the risk of paralysis. Parallels between the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis and poliomyelitis have been made (Poskanzer et al., 1963) . However, travel from high-risk to low-risk areas increases incidences of paralytic poliomyelitis, a phenomenon that is not seen with multiple sclerosis. Disease associated with improved sanitation should have a later and later onset of disease over the decades. Similar analogies with varicella-zoster virus have been made with its opposite distribution; early infection is prevalent in temperate zones, and infections are less common and of later onset at more tropical latitudes (Ross and Cheang, 1995) . A more convincing argument has been made for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), where early childhood infection in developing countries is not associated with clinical disease, whereas infection in adolescence and young adults is related to the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis. Later but uniform infection with the virus and a more frequent history of infectious mononucleosis have been found in multiple sclerosis patients (see section on EBV, below). In several studies patients with multiple sclerosis were found to have a history of measles and other childhood diseases at later ages (Sullivan et al., 1984; Bachmann and Kesselring, 1998) , but these findings were not confirmed in a more recent study that minimized recall bias (Bager et al., 2004) . The notion that lack of certain infections owing to improved sanitation may lead to multiple sclerosis via inappropriate responses to innocuous substances or subsequent infections later in life has been formally conceptualized as the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" and has been proposed by some to underlie the higher incidence of multiple sclerosis in industrialized countries (Leibowitz et al., 1966; Fleming and Fabry, 2007) . In support of this hypothesis, a small study demonstrated that parasitic infection can ameliorate the clinical course of multiple sclerosis and induce beneficial immune responses (Correale and Farez, 2007) .",

The encephalitis usually occurs in kids less than 6 months of age, and paralysis or death may ensue within weeks. Again, the animals are afebrile during the disease with a pleocytosis and elevated spinal fluid protein. Pathology in both diseases is characterized by multifocal white-matter lesions that are most prominent in the periventricular and subependymal areas.

The virus is an enterovirus similar morphologically and epidemiologically to human polioviruses. These murine viruses, however, persist in the nervous system, and demyelination was found in chronically infected mice (Daniels et al., 1952) . In 1975, Lipton reported that, after intracerebral inoculation of young mice, many developed acute paralytic disease with typical pathology of poliomyelitis, and virus antigen was shown in neurons; but about half of these animals survived. After intervals of 1-5 months, these survivors developed a progressive inflammatory myelopathy characterized by demyelination. This unique biphasic disease has been widely studied. The acute paralytic disease is clearly associated with the infection and destruction of motor neurons. The mechanism of the late demyelination involves persistent infection, and both macrophages and oligodendrocytes are infected (Brahic et al., 2005; Lipton et al., 2005) . Immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide or antithymocyte serum prevents the late demyelination, however, suggesting that demyelination is immune-mediated (Lipton and Dal Canto, 1976) . Indeed, in vivo depletion and neutralization studies have suggested important roles for both CD4 \u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells in mediating Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelination (Tsunoda and Fujinami, 2010) .",

The pathogenesis appears to be complex, with studies showing that late demyelination does not occur in mice lacking B or T cells, but does occur with transfer of virus-specific T cells or virus-specific antibodies (Stohlman and Hinton, 2001; Kim and Perlman, 2005) . In addition, both monocyte-derived macrophages and microglia are present in regions of demyelination and can be observed to contact demyelinating axons (Templeton et al., 2008; Bender and Weiss, 2010) .

In most patients it erupts abruptly days or several weeks after a viral exanthem or virus-like illness, but the disorder is not specific to viruses and has been seen after some bacterial illness, immunizations, and drug and serum therapies (Noorbakhsh et al., 2008) . Fifty years ago it was estimated that one-third of all cases of clinical encephalitis were postinfectious. The commonest cause was measles, which, along with cases rarely associated with rubella and mumps, has been largely eliminated in regions where children are protected by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The second major cause of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was a vaccine, vaccinia virus, which was abandoned after the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1977. More recently the varicella-zoster vaccine has further reduced the risk of this disease. It is now estimated that less than 10% of cases of encephalitis represent acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. This exhibits a remarkable success in disease control by both introducing and eliminating immunizations (Johnson, 1994; Johnson and Major, 2004) . The pathologic appearance is remarkably similar to that in the neuroparalytic complication in postexposure rabies vaccination and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis . All three disorders have an abrupt monophasic clinical disease, similar perivenular inflammation and demyelination, and immunologic findings indicating sensitization to myelin proteins (Lisak and Zweiman, 1977; Johnson et al., 1984) . After measles, this complication occurs in about 1 per 1000 cases, with a mortality rate of about 20% and a high rate of sequelae in survivors. Measles virus is known to infect peripheral blood leukocytes and to alter immune responses. The frequent secondary infections are thought to result from immunosuppression, yet the encephalomyelitis is assumed to represent a hypersensitivity response. Antibody response to measles virus is normal in both uncomplicated measles and measles encephalomyelitis, but lymphocytes from patients with measles show prolonged suppression of lymphoproliferative responses to mitogens. This occurs to an equal degree in uncomplicated measles, measles complicated by secondary infections, and measles with encephalomyelitis . The failure of mitogen responses and normal immune regulation appear to result from immune activations by the infection (Griffin et al., 1989) . One result of this activation is the finding that a large percentage of patients with encephalomyelitis have lymphocyte proliferative responses in the presence of human myelin basic protein , a finding analogous to that in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Thus, it appears that measles may interrupt the normal regulatory mechanisms that prevent responses to self antigens.",

The virus is cleared by the time encephalomyelitis develops, and virus cannot be isolated from the brain or spinal fluid, intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins against measles virus is not found , and immunocytochemical staining fails to demonstrate measles virus antigen in the brains of patients dying at various intervals after measles encephalomyelitis (Gendelman et al., 1984) .

By the mid-1990s approximately 4% of patents dying of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. With the routine use of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996, incidence and death rates of progressive multifocal leukoencephalpathy have gradually declined, though not reaching pre-epidemic levels (Christensen et al., 2010) . The demyelinated foci show a loss of oligodendrocytes. Surrounding the demyelinated areas, the oligodendrocytes are enlarged and contain intranuclear INFECTIONS AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus particles, often forming pseudocrystalline arrays (ZuRhein, 1969) . Astrocytes within the lesions are often abnormal, multinucleated, and may contain mitotic figures. Astrocytes may express tumor antigen of JC virus but are not classically transformed, since some virus particles are found in astrocytes.

If the oligodendrocytes are infected, antibody or cell-mediated immune reactions against these antigens could lead to oligodendrocyte lysis and demyelination.

Similar crossreactivity has been observed between human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), influenza, and human coronavirus peptides and myelin epitopes, emphasizing the promiscuity of T cell-peptide interactions that may promote autoimmunity following infection (Tejada-Simon et al., 2003; Markovic-Plese et al., 2005; Boucher et al., 2007) . Demyelination due to soluble molecules released by inflammatory cells (cytokines and lymphokines or proteases) has been called the \"innocent bystander effect.\" This was originally described with the demyelination surrounding an intracerebral tuberculin reaction and related to proteases released by activated lymphocytes or macrophages (Cammer et al., 1978) . In visna virus leukoencephalitis the myelin destruction appears related to infected macrophages and microglia with release of a toxic signal molecule (Kennedy et al., 1985) . Many glial-derived molecules have been implicated in inflammatory demyelination and neuronal injury, including tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide (Gandhi et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "In 1962, Adams and Imagawa reported that antibody titers against measles virus were higher in patients with multiple sclerosis than in controls. Measles antibodies were detected in cerebrospinal fluid of over 75% of the patients with multiple sclerosis and not in controls. These startling findings soon were confirmed in over 30 subsequent studies. These confirmatory studies also found higher levels of serum antibodies against many other viruses, but the results were less consistent and less robust than the findings of measles antibodies (Norrby, 1978; Bray et al., 1983) . Studies comparing levels of antibody in spinal fluid with those in serum rather consistently showed intrathecal synthesis of antibodies against measles virus, but abnormalities in the serum/ spinal fluid antibody ratios have also been found for a wider spectrum of agents (Table 7. 3). In one study, 23% of patients with multiple sclerosis had disproportionately high spinal fluid antibodies to two or more viruses (Norrby et al., 1974) ; in another study, simultaneous intrathecal synthesis occurred to as many as 11 different agents in the same patient (Salmi et al., 1983) . In discordant twin studies higher serum and spinal fluid levels of antibody are usually found in the affected twin (Kinnunen et al., 1990 ). These findings might suggest that multiple viruses can cause multiple sclerosis or that preprogrammed B cells are nonspecifically activated or released from immune regulation after entering the brain (Cremer et al., 1980) . Studies of responses to one protein of a virus and not another and studies of antibody-variable regions suggest a more specific response (Nath and Wolinsky, 1990) . It is important to note that the finding of higher serum antibody titers to measles is not diseasespecific; similar findings have been reported in lupus erythematosus, Reiter's syndrome, and chronic hepatitis. Also measles infection is not a prerequisite for disease, since measles has been reported to occur after the onset of multiple sclerosis.",

            "text": "Infection with this virus is almost universal, and the virus persists in latent form in B cells. In tropical and impoverished areas of the world, where multiple sclerosis prevalence is low, infection occurs in childhood and is essentially asymptomatic. In temperate zones and developed countries infection is delayed in many until adolescence or young adult years, and in these cases primary infection may be manifest by the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis. In numerous cohort and case-control studies a history of infectious mononucleosis was more frequent in patients with multiple sclerosis, and a recent meta-analysis estimates that infectious mononucleosis doubles the risk of multiple sclerosis (Handel et al., 2010) . In many serologic studies multiple sclerosis patients are virtually uniformly positive for antibodies to EBV before onset of neurologic symptoms, although prior infection is not a prerequisite for development of disease in the pediatric population (Matyn et al., 1993; Haahr et al., 1995; Ascherio and Munch, 2000; Levin et al., 2003; Pohl et al., 2006; Banwell et al., 2007) . A prospective study showed that persons who will develop multiple sclerosis exhibit an altered immune response against EBV with a high IgG activity to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) in the absence of high activity to virus capsid antigen (VCA), and this is pronounced in the 5 years before clinical onset of multiple sclerosis (Sundstrom et al., 2004) . In many other studies, serum antibodies to both VCA and EBNA1 are elevated. Notably, both seroprevalence and titers of antibodies to EBNA1 and VCA are increased in pediatric multiple sclerosis cases, indicating that infection precedes multiple sclerosis even in cases of early-onset multiple sclerosis (Pohl et al., 2006; Banwell et al., 2007) . A recent meta-analysis that included numerous case-control studies of antibodies to EBV antigens found odds ratios of over 12 for EBNA-1 and over 5 for VCA seropositivity in multiple sclerosis patients compared to controls (Santiago et al., 2010) . Although serologic studies have consistently demonstrated evidence of past infection, there is little evidence for active infection or reactivation of EBV in patients with multiple sclerosis. Neither the presence nor quantity of viral DNA in plasma, peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells, or whole blood has been consistently increased in individuals with multiple sclerosis (Santiago et al., 2010; Lucas et al., 2011) . Although some longitudinal studies have found an association between virus activation and disease activity in multiple sclerosis patients, others have not confirmed this, finding instead an association between titers of EBNA-1 and clinical and radiologic markers of disease activity (Wandinger et al., 2000; Torkildsen et al., 2008; Farrell et al., 2009) . In many nervous system infections antibodies are generated intrathecally, giving rise to oligoclonal bands of antibody in spinal fluid; these bands are typically present in multiple sclerosis, but the target antigen remains a mystery. In some multiple sclerosis patients these bands have been reported to bind to EBNA (Rand et al., 2000) , while more recent studies suggest that, when present, oligoclonal EBV-specific responses are often systemic in origin and are found in a wide variety of neurologic disorders (Franciotta et al., 2010) . Several provocative reports have described patients with neurologic complication of acute EBV infections who went on to develop progressive or relapsing disease, diagnosed as multiple sclerosis (Shaw and Alvord, 1987; Bray et al., 1992) . Another describes a 6-year-old with 11 episodes of relapsing disease and high titers of Epstein-Barr antibodies. At autopsy typical multiple sclerosis lesions were found, and PCR of brain showed EBV sequences (Pedneault et al., 1992) . Laser capture microdissection of meninges and white-matter lesions from multiple sclerosis brains followed by reverse transcription PCR has demonstrated the presence of EBV latency-associated genes in inflamed tissue (Serafini et al., 2010) . In addition, EBV-encoded RNAs (EBERs), the small noncoding RNAs which are abundantly expressed in lately infected cells, have been found in multiple sclerosis lesions via in situ hybridization, although they are also present in cases of stroke (Tzartos et al., 2012) . These findings in brain or spinal fluid are difficult to interpret, since EBV is latent in B cells. B cells are rare in normal brain or spinal fluid but do enter in inflammatory diseases (and are present in the lumen of vessels in brain sections). Demonstration of the virus in neural cells would provide stronger evidence for a causal relationship between this virus and multiple sclerosis.",

Initial observations of higher antibody levels in serum and presence of antibodies in spinal fluid were similar to other viruses. However, DNA was detected in spinal fluid by PCR (Wilborn et al., 1994) , and the following year herpesvirus-6 DNA was reported in the majority of multiple sclerosis and control brains (Challoner et al., 1995) . However, immunocytochemical staining showed a change of distribution: in normal brains virus antigen was found primarily in meningeal cells, but in multiple sclerosis lesions, adjacent cells, thought to represent neurons and oligodendrocytes, were positive. Subsequent studies have shown remarkable variance; some have correlated virus in blood or spinal fluid with disease activity (Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2004) , whereas others have not. Different IgG and IgM responses have been reported, but other reports have failed to confirm this finding (Virtanen and Jacobson, 2012) . The frequency of detectable virus in brain and the correlation with disease have been extreme, from reports of lack of detectable virus in diseased or normal brain tissue, to a claim that 90% of active multiple sclerosis lesions were positive for viral antigen while positive staining was found in only 13% of brain sections without active disease (Knox et al., 2000) . Utilizing laser capture microdissection followed by PCR, Cermelli and colleagues (2003) found that herpesvirus-6 DNA was detected far more frequently in multiple sclerosis plaques as compared to normal-appearing white matter from multiple sclerosis patients or from controls. Using in situ PCR, Goodman and colleagues (2003) showed herpesvirus-6 genome in numerous oligodendrocytes as well as lymphocytes and microglia in acute multiple sclerosis lesions. Also with in situ PCR, Opsahl and Kennedy (2005) have shown herpesvirus-6 gene transcription in oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis patients' normal-appearing white matter, lesional tissue, and normal control brain sections. Viral mRNA was higher in white matter and lesions of patients, and viral gene expression was higher in samples from lesions.",

The characteristic presence of long terminal repeats followed by gag, pol, and env genes identifies their retroviral origins. These sequences are thought to represent ancestral infections in which integrated DNA is now passed on in Mendelian fashion. Comparisons to ERVs of apes and old world monkeys suggest that some entered our genome 25 million years ago (Voisset et al., 1999) . No endogenous retrovirus has been convincingly linked to human disease, but the potential to enhance downstream cellular genes has led to speculation that they might be important in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Sj\u20ac ogren's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type I diabetes (Perron and Seigneurin, 1999) .",

Subsequently his group analyzed monocytes from patients and controls and reported evidence of retroviral activity or retrovirus particles in the majority (Perron et al., 1991) Recognition that the viral elements were endogenous, as opposed to an exogenous retrovirus, resulted in coinage of the name \"multiple sclerosis-associated retroviral element\" (MSRV). Several other laboratories have found similar HERVs in blood and spinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients, and the presence of MSRV in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis has been associated with a greater rate of disease progression (Sotgiu et al., 2010) . Although similar activity has also been found in other inflammatory neurologic diseases and schizophrenia, the frequency of HERV detection has generally been more frequent in multiple sclerosis (Dolei et al., 2002 : Dolei, 2005 . Of the over 30 HERV families named according to the one-letter code of the transfer RNA used to prime reverse transcription, HERV-W, HERV-K, and HERV-H have been most frequently associated with multiple sclerosis (Antony et al., 2011) . Much recent attention has focused upon HERV-W, of which MSRV is a member. In addition, the protein syncytin-1, a glial protein that induces neuroinflammation and is expressed more frequently in multiple sclerosis than control brains, is derived from an envelope gene of HERV-W (Antony et al., 2004) . Retroviral protein and virion production has been postulated to result from interactions with other viruses, including herpesviruses (Christensen, 2005) . Specificity was further questioned in studies that showed HERV RNA levels increased with stimulation of macrophages in culture, and in brain in patients with HIV encephalopathy as well as in multiple sclerosis (Johnston et al., 2001) . This study suggests that immune activity enhances viral expression rather than being a cause of the immune activation.",

They reported positive cultures in 64% of multiple sclerosis patients and only 11% of control patients, and positive PCR results in 97% of multiple sclerosis patients and only 18% of patients with other neurologic diseases. They subsequently reported that oligoclonal bands in spinal fluid could be partially or completely adsorbed by C. pneumoniae antigens (Yao et al., 2001) . These reports have been followed by a plethora of reports partially confirming or refuting the results, but none with the robust results of the initial report. In a subsequent report, for example, PCR detected C. pneumoniae in 21% of multiple sclerosis patients, 43% of patients with other neuroinflammatory diseases, and none in healthy controls (Gieffers et al., 2001) . A prospective serologic study of several large US populations showed that neither seropositivity to C. pneumoniae nor level of antibody predicted risk of developing multiple sclerosis (Munger et al., 2004) . However, a meta-analysis examining over 70 studies found that multiple sclerosis patients were more likely to have detectable levels of Chlamydia DNA in their cerebrospinal fluid and intrathecally synthesized immunoglobulins compared to other patients with neurologic diseases (Bagos et al., 2006) . A recent small study found that C. pneumoniae-specific intrathecal immunoglobulins were found more frequently in patients with progressive, as compared to remitting-relapsing, forms of multiple sclerosis (Fainardi et al., 2009) . Overall, these reports support the hypothesis that the bacteria are passively carried into the nervous system when host macrophages traffic into inflammatory responses.",

The presence of high EBNA1 antibody titers was associated with a higher risk for multiple sclerosis among HLA-DRB1*15-positive individuals as compared with DRB1*15-negative individuals (Sundstrom et al., 2008) , although several subsequent studies have not confirmed a direct interaction (De Jager et al., 2008; Waubant et al., 2011) . Another major histocompatibility gene locus, HLA B7, was associated with increased anti-EBV VCA levels and worse radiologic markers of disease (Zivadinov et al., 2009) . These studies support the idea that HLA genes may influence the risk of multiple sclerosis in part through the immune control of EBV infection. Notably, remote infection with herpes simples virus 1 was associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis in DRB1*15-positive children, while the reverse was observed in those who were DRB1*15-negative (Waubant et al., 2011) . Active replication of human herpesvirus-6 in the serum of patients with multiple sclerosis was associated with a polymorphism of the MHC2TA gene, which encodes a transcription factor involved in expression of MHC class II genes, including HLA DRB1*15 (Martinez et al., 2007) .",

Recent recognition of the vast numbers of commensal organisms that reside within an individual, termed the human microbiome, suggests that the manner in which microbes interact with each other and with the human genome to influence risk of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases is likely to be extremely complex (Ochoa-Reparaz et al., 2011) .",

Virus, though causal, may not be recoverable at the time of disease, as in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Studies have not provided the desired answers but have defined the complexity of the questions. Finally, it may be that the childhood exposure is not to an infectious agent at all, but to some other factor that leads to both demyelinating disease and abnormal production of viral antibodies. The delineation of different pathologic changes in acute multiple sclerosis lesions (Lucchinetti et al., 2000) raises the question of multiple mechanisms of pathogenesis in multiple sclerosis and consequently multiple causes. Historically a syndrome (signs and symptoms \"that run together\") was assumed to have a common cause, but advances in both genetics and infectious diseases repeatedly provide contrary evidence. In genetics one phenotype often proves to have many genotypes, and single genotypes can be expressed as different phenotypes. In virology the neurologic syndrome of \"aseptic meningitis\" has proved to be caused by over 100 different infectious agents, and conversely single agents such as HIV, varicella-zoster virus and Treponema pallidum can cause a spectrum of clinically and pathologically distinct diseases. Gilden (2005) and Lipton et al. (2007) in recent reviews support the idea of a \"single multiple sclerosis virus\"; but from a different vantage point one could consider some cases of tropical spastic paraplegia and Lyme encephalopathy with white-matter lesions dispersed in time and space. Before the discovery of HTLV-1 virus or Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, these patients' diseases fulfilled Schumacher's criteria for multiple sclerosis. With present knowledge do we now regard these as disorders where, in our ignorance, we erred in diagnosis, or should we consider these as a small portion of that multiple sclerosis syndrome for which we now know the cause?",
