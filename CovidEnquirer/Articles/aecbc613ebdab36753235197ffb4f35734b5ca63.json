These two women had lived together for all of their 58 years and neither was receiving anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs at the time of these studies. Both twins demonstrated comparable 7s and 19s humoral antibody response to KLH, as well as similar viral antibody titers. However, the twin with SLE was anergic to common antigens, streptokinase-streptodornase, Trichophyton and Candida; furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to KLH did not develop after immunization. This observed discrepancy between humoral and cellular immunity in genetically similar subjects may be significant in the pathogenesis of SLE.",

In contrast, there was no cutaneous response to the injection of 1 or 10 pg of KLH in the twin with SLE (Case 1), and after the injection of 100 pg only a 4 by 5 mm site of induration was observed. Biopsy of the 10 mm sites confirmed the difference in response of the twin sisters; there was a paucity of lymphocytes near blood vessels and surrounding dermis in the section from the twin with SLE (Case 1), whereas a round cell infiltrate typical of delayed hypersensitivity was apparent in the dermis of the healthy twin (Case 2). Lymphocyte blastogenic response (Table II) : Prior to immunization, neither twin's lymphocytes could be stimulated by 15 pg/ml KLH. The healthy sister (Case 2) demonstrated sensitization of her lymphocytes to KLH 14 days after immunization at this time. 3HTdr uptake by stimulated cells were 3.6 times control values. By 28 days after immunization this response had increased to 49 times control values. In contrast, lymphocytes from the twins with SLE (Case 1) failed to respond to KLH. 3HTdr uptake of her stimulated cells was never greater than two times control values. The kinetics of the 28 day response to KLH are reported elsewhere [19] .",
