Objective: The objective was to adapt and apply Shortell et al.' s (1998) four dimensions of CQI in an examination of a public health accountability and performance management initiative in Ontario, Canada. Methods: In total, 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with informants from public health units and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. A web survey of public health managers in the province was also carried out. Results: A mix of facilitators and barriers was identified. Leadership and organizational cultures, conducive to CQI success were evident. However, limitations in performance measurement and managerial discretion were key barriers. Conclusion: The four dimensions of CQI provided insight into both facilitators and barriers of CQI adoption in public health. Future research should compare the outcomes of public health CQI initiatives to the framework' s stated facilitators and barriers.",

CQI is an approach to the management and improvement of organizational services and processes (Dilley et al. 2012; Nicolucci et al. 2010; Radawski 1999) . The approach stands in contrast to quality control and assurance by virtue of its focus on identifying opportunities to improve work processes as opposed to identifying individualized problems and maintaining a status quo (Dever 1997) . CQI relies heavily on performance measurement and analysis, as well as on the involvement of leadership and front-line staff in decision-making processes (Kosseff 1992; McLaughlin 1987; Radawski 1999) .",

Risk-taking in the development of strategic plans and priorities and examples of innovative programming were highlighted as proof of the health unit' s commitment to a developmental culture. An example of one Site-C informant reflecting on the health unit' s organizational culture explained that: \"\u2026 evidence informed decision-making is a large component. It' s one of the strategic priorities in our health unit and so really having that \u2026 engaging in processes of informed innovation certainly informs decision-making and out of that what are the risks that we are taking to do things differently than other health units based on the evidence that we have found.\" -Site-C informant Resistance to change, unrewarded achievement, and hierarchical and rational organizational cultures are regard as barriers to the cultural dimension. In this regard, there was limited evidence of an approach for rewarding achievement and good performance related directly to the province' s CQI initiative. However, some public health unit interviewees argued that celebrating achievement of targets was important -something that their health units did internally when goals were achieved or improved upon. Site-A provided an example of this:",

On the issue of whether the system was primarily intended to promote learning (a key characteristic of CQI), those surveyed in the area of chronic disease prevention were significantly more uncertain than respondents from other areas (p < 0.02). Likewise, 84.3% of the survey sample agreed or strongly agreed that the initiative was primarily concerned with maintaining compliance with public health practice and performance expectations -resembling a quality assurance orientation.

            "text": "This study shows a mix of facilitators and barriers to CQI best-practice in Ontario, according to Shortell et al.' s (1998) four-dimensions framework. Evidence of strong leadership interest and involvement in quality improvement at both local and provincial levels was clear. Strong developmental and/or group cultures were also evident at public health unit interview sites, which reflected leadership efforts to foster high performance and provided additional insight into their CQI capacity. The importance of senior and managerial leadership engagement cannot be over-emphasized, as previous reviews of public health quality improvement initiatives have shown (Dilley et al. 2012; Randolph et al. 2012) . However, Ontario' s quality improvement initiative also featured limitations placed on the meaningful influence of local leadership in decision-making by provincial stakeholders, which was reflected by misalignments in priorities, even though agreement on the principle of quality improvement was mutual. A part of this phenomenon may be because of the split emphasis that Ontario' s system of accountability and performance management has between quality assurance and quality improvement. Assurance of legislative and service requirements promotes top-down decision-making and control, whereas a focus on improving outcomes requires local leadership and discretion. Similar misalignments were highlighted in the work of Degroff et al. (2010) who argued that many of the challenges to applying performance measurement to national public health programs in the US were due, in part, to the competing interests of quality improvement and public accountability (DeGroff et al. 2010) .",

This confirmation is a promising indicator that the framework may hold value as a tool for public health decision-makers developing and implementing CQI systems.
