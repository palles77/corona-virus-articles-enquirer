Diseases such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza cause economic losses at the global level and jeopardize diplomatic relations between countries. As wildlife are the source of at least 70% of all emerging diseases and given the on-going concerns associated with wildlife trade as a disease transmission mechanism, we provide a 'global snapshot' of the legal trade in live wild animals and take stock of the potential health risks that it poses to global human health. Our analysis showed that 11,569,796 individual live wild animals, representing 1316 different species were exported from 189 different countries between 2012 and 2016. China was the largest exporter of live mammals (with 98,979 animals representing 58.7% of global trade). Nicaragua was the largest exporter of live amphibians (with 122,592 animals representing 53.8% of global trade). South Africa was the largest exporter of live birds (with 889,607 animals representing 39.2% of global trade). Peru was the largest exporter of live reptiles (with 1,675,490 animals representing 18.8% of global trade). Our analysis showed that mostly the USA and other high-income countries, the largest importers, drive the live animal trade. High-income countries and not the countries where wildlife diseases and pathogens are more likely to occur reported almost all of the disease reports to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Based on our findings, we discuss how maximising trade bans; working on human behaviour change and improving regulatory efforts to improve surveillance will decrease the risk of future pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks.",

            "text": "Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases, caused by a variety of pathogenic agents (including bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses and prions) that are naturally transmitted from vertebrate mammals to humans and vice versa (Wang and Crameri, 2014) . Zoonotic diseases have serious large-scale impacts on human health; they cause about a billion cases of human illness and millions of deaths every year (Karesh et al., 2012) , which, in addition to the suffering experienced, in turn affects the national health budgets of governments worldwide. Outbreaks of well-known human diseases of zoonotic origin in recent decades such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza have caused economic losses at the global level. For example, the SARS outbreak in 2003 alone cost China's economy $25.3 billion (Hai et al., 2004) and reduced the gross domestic product (GDP) across East Asia by 2% (King et al., 2006) . Similarly, the World Bank estimated that an influenza epidemic could cost $900 billion globally in one year (King et al., 2006) . At a global level, according to one estimate, the economic damage caused by emerging zoonoses is around hundreds of billion US dollars in the past 20 years (Karesh et al., 2012) . In addition to the negative impacts of zoonotic diseases on global human health and economy, zoonotic diseases also adversely affect animal health, jeopardize the diplomatic relations between countries and can undermine conservation efforts to protect the world's biodiversity (Karesh et al., 2005; Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, 2008; Johnson et al., 2015; Greatorex et al., 2016; Olival et al., 2017; see Macdonald and Laurenson, 2006 for key topics in infectious diseases and conservation). According to the \"One World -One Health\" concept created in 2004, the human health and animal health are interdependent and bound to the health of the ecosystems in which they exist (Destoumieux-Garz on et al., 2018) .",

The first reported occurrence of monkeypox outside Africa in 2003 due to pet prairie dogs (they were infected by African rodents imported to the US) (Bernard and Anderson, 2006) and multistate outbreak of Salmonella Agbeni Infections (outbreak was Linked to Pet Turtles) in 2017 are just two examples (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018) . Furthermore, from the point of view of those seeking to curtail wildlife trade, the risk of infectious diseases was the primary factor dissuading those interested in buying a wild animal pet from doing so (Moorhouse et al., 2017) . However, quantifying the global wildlife trade is extremely difficult since it ranges in scale from local barter to major international routes, and much is conducted illegally or through informal networks (Karesh et al., 2005) . In fact, the complexity of monitoring of wildlife trade has been compared to that of arms trade (Smith et al., 2017) .",

The illegal trade in live animals represent a serious threat global health due to its clandestine and unregulated nature. Given the on-going concerns associated with the global trade in wildlife as a disease transmission mechanism, and since legal trade records are available, in this study we aim to provide the first 'global snapshot' of the global legal trade in live wild animals and to take stock of the potential health risks that it poses to global human health. In order to do so, we first characterised four of the major taxonomic vertebrate classes (amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals) and countries for the period between 2011 and 2016 as reported by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)-World Conservation Monitoring Centre Monitoring Centre (WCMC) Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Second, we identified the infectious diseases originating from wildlife as reported by the world's governments to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the scientific literature for the period 2008e2016 and classified them according to their relevance to particular wild animal taxa. Finally, based on our findings, we provide recommendations for safer trade and a healthier planet.",

            "text": "Infection with Plasmodium spp. In fact, the USA is the global leader in illegal and legal wildlife consumption and between 2000 and 2009, more than 1.48 billion live animals were legally imported to USA where 92% of imports were for commercial purposes, largely the pet trade (Smith et al., 2009 (Smith et al., , 2017 . Although the USA was second to Hong Kong with regards to legal live reptile imports, it still involved 1,275,892 individual animals and represented 14.3% of all such live trade between 2012 and 2016. The fact that Mexico, a non-WEIRD country, imported the most live birds legally (328,304 animals representing 32.7% of such live trade) is likely due to the fact that both the USA (following the Wild Bird Conservation Act) and the EU (in response to avian influenza) have opted to ban international imports in wild caught live birds since 1992 and 2007 respectively (Cardador et al., 2017) . Our review of the CITES Trade Database also provides insight into shifting patterns regarding how live wild animals involved in trade are being sourced. We found that the number of individual wild animals that were sourced from wild situations fell by 949,521 individual animals in 2016 representing 55.2% reduction in this type of trade globally compared to 2012. We also found that the number of individual animals that were sourced from captive situations decreased by 157,542 individual animals in 2016 representing a 13.2% decrease in this type of trade globally compared to 2012. The benefits and impacts of captive breeding for supplying commercial trade in wildlife on human health are both poorly understood and subject to debate (for example see Ballou, 1993; Kock et al., 2010; Gerhold and Hickling, 2016) . On one hand, captive breeding at registered facilities provides relevant health authorities with an opportunity to better monitor the disease risks that this type of trade poses to the public both now and in the future. However, if managed poorly, captive breeding can also involve large numbers of animals in poor welfare conditions which are a likely source of zoonotic diseases (for example see Ballou, 1993; Kock et al., 2010; Gerhold and Hickling, 2016) .",

However, mammals were of almost equal concern as they featured in 1472 (47%) of disease reports submitted during this time.

Previous research has shown that substantial risk of zoonotic diseases originate in areas where research effort is low, with the majority of surveillance effort focused on countries from which emerging infections were least likely to occur (Jones et al., 2008) . Similarly, as our review of the OIE WAHIS-Wild interface showed, the disease reports of wildlife species available from the OIE reflect a similar pattern. We found that almost all of the disease reports were submitted by WEIRD countries earguably due to higher reporting rates in such countries-and not from poorer parts of the world where arguably diseases and pathogens are more likely to occur (see Jones et al., 2008 for in depth analysis).",

Consequently, from a policy perspective, trade bans have been proposed as a tool to help achieve these threat reduction goals. Arguably, the most prominent application of a trade ban was made by the EU on wild bird imports to prevent the spread of avian influenza (McGrath, 2017) . However, a recent analysis of CITES Trade Database records has confirmed that, despite a sharp global decline in bird trade, new trade routes emerged that pose an on-going, and potentially increased, threat to human health . Therefore, although national and regional bans can curtail invasion risk globally, to be fully effective and prevent rerouting of trade flows, arguably bans should be global .

Wildlife farming is a growing industry (Tensen, 2016) . The merits of such commercial captive breeding as a wildlife conservation tool are subject to debate (see Tensen, 2016 for a comprehensive list of relevant articles). However, findings focused on the human health threat that such operations potentially pose have not featured prominently in these discussions to date. This is of particular concern given that evidence strongly suggests that in several cases many species reported to CITES as captive-bred are in reality taken from the wild (e.g. Nijman and Shepherd, 2015; Poole and Shepherd, 2017) and that poorly managed commercial captive breeding facilities -where standardized risk management plans are needed-could provide the ideal environments to harbour the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Therefore, although national and regional bans can curtail invasion risk globally, to be fully effective and prevent rerouting of trade flows, arguably bans should also incorporate individuals sourced from commercial captive breeding facilities that aren't inspected to be qualified for exemption by the local authorities.",

For example, even when supported by a coalition of governmental institutions and non governmental organisations, such policy decisions have the potential to stimulate illegal wildlife trade activity and can run counter to the values of human equity and sustainable development unless they are accompanied by associated human behaviour change initiatives focused on reducing the involvement and dependency of those involved in both purchase and sale. With regards to consumers, as Moorhouse et al. (2017) has shown, providing information on the health threats posed by exotic pets can play a significant role in affecting consumer attitudes. Therefore, human behaviour change initiatives focused on consumers in WEIRD countries could prove particularly pivotal in this regard. However, practitioners should be reminded of the basic assumption of knowledge-deficit theory and that is providing facts to people will translate into a change in behaviour, is rarely met in real-world (see Schultz, 2002; Simis et al., 2016; Can and Macdonald, 2018 for real-world examples) . Since the demand for legal wildlife trade is parallel to demand for illegal trade (Wyler and Sheikh, 2008) , reducing the demand for legal trade by affecting consumer attitudes in Western societies will also decrease the demand for the illegal trade. Reducing the demand for trade in the resource limited countries (non-WEIRD countries) through behaviour change remains to be a bigger challenge.",

            "text": "We acknowledge a significant caveat in our study specifically about the legal trade records and their limitations. Available records on wildlife trade are problematic. Even in USA, trade records kept by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (arguably the world's most powerful and technically capable wildlife service) have limitations, particularly non-CITES-listed species are largely undocumented, meaning that the species that entered the country are not really known (see Smith et al., 2017 for details) . When the species are not known, then the pathogens those species potentially carry cannot be inferred. Therefore the risks associated with live animal trade (including exotic pet trade) can neither be fully estimated nor eliminated. There is very sparse data for disease records and most of the countries have reported no diseases. However, absence of disease records isn't evidence of absence. Sparse records for diseases and absence of disease reports in OIE WAHIS-Wild records reflect the lack of effort in reporting the diseases by the countries. Moreover, with regards to particular trade chains, within the CITES trade records, there is not always a perfect match between reported quantities of exported animals by exporter countries and reported quantities of imported animals by importing countries. For example, for carnivores, there were a total of 938 CITES records but in 558 of these records, the importer countries didn't specify the quantity of animals they imported. Similarly, in 220 out of 938 CITES records concerning carnivores, the exporter countries didn't specify the quantities of animals they exported. Similar paradoxes were apparent in mammal trade records (see Fig. 15 ) as well as for amphibians, birds and reptiles. The reason for such paradoxes might be explained by the fact that not all Parties submit complete reports or submits reports at all to the CITES Secretariat due to various reasons such as lack of personnel or resources (UNEP-WCMC, 2013) . Finally, we recognise that another factor that would determine the risk the legal live animal trade pose to global health might not only be related with the number of animals traded (i.e. volume of trade) but it might be also related with how frequent the trade occurs. This remains to be an interesting question that can be investigated by further studies in the field by actually sampling from the shipments.",
