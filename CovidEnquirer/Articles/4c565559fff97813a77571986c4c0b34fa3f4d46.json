However, many host-targeted agents are natural products which can be difficult to optimize using synthetic chemistry alone. We describe the orthogonal combination of bioengineering and semisynthetic chemistry to optimize the drug-like properties of sanglifehrin A, a known cyclophilin inhibitor of mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide origin in order to generate the drug candidate NVP018 (formerly BC556). NVP018 is a potent inhibitor of HBV, HCV and HIV-1 replication, shows minimal inhibition of major drug transporters and has a high barrier to generation of both HCV and HIV-1 resistance.",

However, this has been hindered in the past by the relative rarity of targets essential to the virus, but nonessential to the host, and the inherent complexity of discovering and developing drugs that effectively target these proteins.",

When combined with improved techniques for DNA transfer and the rapid targeted alteration of biosynthetic genes this provide a powerful platform for focused drug discovery efforts with the aim of improving drug-like properties, pharmacokinetics and reducing offtarget effects. These bioengineering techniques are readily combined with semisynthesis to identify molecules with further improved properties. In particular, inactivation of precursor pathways can allow mutasynthesis, the process of feeding a synthetic analogue of the precursor which is then incorporated, biosynthetically, into the final molecule 8, 9 . This enables a combinatorial element to bioengineering.",

However, cyclophilins recruited from host cells have been shown to have essential roles in many viral life-cycles. Initially, cyclophilin A was shown to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions 14, 15 , involved in viral replication, and its expression level in patients related to the speed of progression to AIDS 16 . Cyclophilin A isomerase activity, and potentially other cyclophilins such as B and cyclophilin 40, have been shown to be required for HCV replication [17] [18] [19] We now describe the use of combined bioengineering and semisynthetic approaches to optimize the drug-like properties of sanglifehrin A, a NP cyclophilin inhibitor, to generate NVP018 (formerly BC556). Preclinical analysis reveals NVP018 to be a molecule displaying in vitro inhibition of HBV and HCV and potent in vitro and oral in vivo inhibition of HIV-1.",

It is this inhibition which is now thought to be the mechanism for the dose limiting hyperbilirubinaemia 34 . These compounds also have drug-drug interaction concerns through inhibition of xenobiotic transporters such as Pgp and BSEP 35, 36 . Comparison of the inhibition of these transporters using vesicular transport or uptake transporter inhibition assays, and in vitro inhibition of the xenobiotic transporters, Pgp and BSEP revealed that whilst alisporivir and CsA potently inhibited many of them, BC544 (figure 1, previously stated as compound 3o in Moss et al., 2011) and NVP018 showed minimal or no inhibition (see table 2 ). To test the effect of NVP018 on bilirubin levels, we then dosed three mice with up to 250 mg/kg/day NVP018 for 7 days.

We therefore tested NVP018 in comparison to BC544 and alisporivir in a CD4+ HeLa HIV-1 inhibitory FACS assay to see if improvements in inhibition of in vitro HCV replicons carried through to HIV-1 inhibitory assays. NVP018 was found to be both more potent as regards HIV-1 EC 50 (see table 3 ) and in terms of maximal viral inhibition, which was seen to reach >95% inhibition with sanglifehrin analogues including BC544 and NVP018 but only 60% with cyclosporin A and alisporivir. This data was similar when repeated in Jurkat cells, activated CD4+ peripheral blood T-lymphocytes and macrophages. One of the concerns with development of alisporivir for treatment of HIV-1 was the presence of natural isolates with the H86Q alisporivir resistant genotype 22 . NVP018 was tested against both lab generated and natural H86Q isolates, and was found to be active in both cases.",

It is also worth noting the recent publications which suggest that these compounds might also have additional impact on Interferon Regulatory Factors, which have long been implicated in the escape of certain viruses, such as HCV and HIV, from the immune system 49, 50 . Whilst cyclophilin inhibitors do not exhibit inhibition of all viruses, they have been shown to have activity against a wide variety of both RNA viruses (eg Coronaviruses, HIV and HCV) and DNA viruses (HCMV, HBV, VZV). It is therefore tempting to speculate that cyclophilin inhibitors may be a step in the direction of agents with broad antiviral activity 51 .",

Male C.B-17 SCID (model #CB17SC-M, homozygous, C.B-Igh-1b/IcrTac-Prkdcscid) mice were obtained at 6-8 weeks of age from Taconic, and cohorts of 50-60 SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice were implanted with tissues from a single donor. Implants were inoculated 18 weeks after implantation with 50 \u00b5L of stock virus or complete DMEM (control infection) by direct injection. Animal protocols were approved by the TSRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Groups of 6 mice each were treated with NVP018 or alisporivir (ALV) at 50 or 100 mg/kg/day by twice-daily oral gavage until implant collection 2 weeks after inoculation.",

Specifically, implant cells were stained with phycoerythrin cyanine dye CY7-conjugated anti-CD4 (BD Biosciences), phycoerythrin cyanine CY5.5-conjugated anti-CD8 (Caltag), allophycocyanin cyanine CY7-conjugated anti-CD3 (eBiosciences), and phycoerythrinconjugated anti-W6/32 (DakoCytomation). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 1.2 % paraformaldehyde and 0.5 % Tween 20, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-p24 (Beckman Coulter), and analyzed on an LSR II (BD Biosciences). After collecting 100,000 total cell events, percentages of marker-positive (CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD8+) thymocytes in the implant samples were determined by first gating on a live lymphoid cell population identified by forward-and side-scatter characteristics and then by CD3 expression. Total RNA was extracted from frozen thymocyte pellets using Trizol LS (Invitrogen) and resuspended in nuclease-free water. The capsid region of the HIV-1 gag was amplified by RT-PCR using 10 \u00b5L of purified RNA and AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
