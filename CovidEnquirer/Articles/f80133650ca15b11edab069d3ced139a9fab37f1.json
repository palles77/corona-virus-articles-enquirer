No details are provided on different etiological causes of AES. As per the latest data, this year till October 31, 7201 cases and 989 deaths of AES are reported from all over the country. 2 Then there are sporadic reports mainly from the different medical institutions on incidence of AES or acute viral encephalitis, mainly among hospitalized children. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There is paucity of population-based studies, as well as incidence rate of a particular viral encephalitis. Most of the population-based studies have focused on outbreak investigations and surveillance of AES. A recent review provides an overview of these studies in some details. 8 ",

Most of the times, the media 'break' the news regarding appearance of an outbreak. Here, the focus seems on 'sensationalization' with hidden motive to harass health officials or institutions. These news items lack specificity and details. The response of the health department and investigating agencies is also equally shoddy and clumsy. The usual 'knee-jerk reaction' is to dub all these outbreaks as viral encephalitis or JE. There is hardly any effort made to define a case properly, a correct case definition is often lacking, teams work with a rigid mindset and complete the ritual of collecting few samples. Lack of adequate research laboratories for virological workup is lacking in the vicinity of most outbreaks, the delay in collecting, transporting and processing the samples further make the entire process a redundant exercise. Autopsies and detailed histopathological studies of viscera have almost become extinct now. 9 Another big flaw is to differentiate various outbreaks of AES on the basis of 'primary' versus the 'secondary' brain diseases.",

Or in other words, 'encephalitis' from the 'encephalopathy'. It is of paramount importance not only to reach at a correct diagnosis, but also to launch preventive measures at community level. There are instances in the past, when an entirely a non-infectious entity was targeted for control with large scale vaccination drive! Many outbreak investigations are terminated before reaching to their conclusive ends. For example, investigations of outbreaks of acute brain diseases with high mortality in Jamshedpur 10 and Nagpur 11 in 50s are still inconclusive. Whether these outbreaks were indeed caused by some viruses or were entirely non-infectious in nature is still undetermined. 12 There is a tendency to dub every outbreak involving fever with altered sensorium as acute encephalitis or AES. Certainly, there are some 'clues' or 'pointers' that hint to a diagnosis other than the acute encephalitis if followed judiciously. 13 WHO has also not provided any proper algorithm for outbreak investigations to those engaged in the field. The major contributors to the broad group of AES should be identified and compartmentalized.",

In fact, as stated Available online at www.sciencedirect.com ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/pid above, the term 'AES' was coined to facilitate JE surveillance. However, in last decade or so, there is a shift in the spectrum of causative organisms responsible for acute encephalitis in India. 8 Most studies have now reported non-JE etiology for AES in India; accordingly, enteroviruses, rhabdoviruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses, etc. are getting larger share. 4, 5, 8 If one analyzes the data provided by NVBDCP, the JE constitutes from a meager 8.9% of all reported AES in 2012 to 19.2% in 2015 till October, 2015 2 (Fig. 1) . It means non-JE viruses and some non-encephalitic illness, i.e. encephalopathies are contributing chiefly to overall burden of AES in India. It seems that JE has now acquired a regional status; its outbreaks are more circumscribed, and confined to a limited geographical area, but are now mainly reported from a few states such as Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand. 2 Of late, people have started questioning the prudence of continuing large scale JE vaccination program in view of its focal nature, low burden, and uncertain effectiveness of currently employed JE vaccine. 14 The vast group of illnesses contained in the non-JE group needs to be defined, if we need to reduce the burden of AES in India. Mere relying on vector control and JE-vaccination may not yield the desired results.",

Take the case of a lethal outbreak in Siliguri, which created havoc among public and heath experts way back in January-February 2001. Several agencies had investigated this peculiar outbreak and came out with their own interpretations and results. Initially, it was reported to be caused by unidentified vial agent, later atypical-Measles virus and Hantavirus infection were blamed, and ultimately, CDC, Atlanta concluded that the outbreak was caused by Nipah/Hendra or closely related virus! 15 There are instances when even premiere investigating agencies had failed to differentiate a non-infectious entity with viral encephalitis.

Merely clubbing all related illnesses under one head is not sufficient. The time has come to move beyond, but presuming every case (or an outbreak) of AES is yet another instance of acute viral encephalitis that in turn is caused by JE virus may not serve the purpose. We need to invest heavily in building a well performing AES surveillance system backed by state-of-the-art laboratory network. Laboratories that perform routine testing for known pathogens responsible for viral encephalitis should be established in every district's health headquarter. Routine surveillance should be augmented and outbreak investigations must be bolstered. We need a well coordinated, thorough systematic outbreak investigation approach with correct methodology to investigate all the recurring outbreaks of unknown etiology rather than clubbing them under one head of viral encephalitis and resorting to empiric preventive measures like mass JE vaccination programs. There must be an official 'early warning' or 'disease alert' system so that our reliance on media reporting and media based investigations is curtailed. Our inability to deal with emerging pathogens or even denying the existence of a problem or censoring the news of any new disease appearance is not going to be rewarding in this era of information revolution.
