This change has been brought about by the increasing use and expanding scope of highthroughput molecular profiling and computational biology, which together fuel discovery in systems biology. In this review, we show how these approaches have revealed an uncontrolled inflammatory response as a contributor to the extreme virulence of the 1918 pandemic and avian H5N1 viruses, and how this response differs from that induced by the 2009 H1N1 viruses responsible for the most recent influenza pandemic. We also discuss how new animal models, such as the Collaborative Cross mouse systems genetics platform, are key to the necessary systematic investigation of the impact of host genetics on infection outcome, how genome-wide RNAi screens have identified hundreds of cellular factors involved in viral replication, and how systems biology approaches are making possible the rational design of new drugs and vaccines against an ever-evolving respiratory virus.",

Most years, influenza outbreaks are relatively predictable, causing 30,000-40,000 deaths in the United States. More serious threats come in the form of exceptionally transmissible or virulent influenza virus variants, which can give rise to worldwide pandemics and greatly increased morbidity and mortality. New viral variants arise through a combination of antigenic drift-gradual changes brought about by point mutations in viral genes-and antigenic shift-abrupt changes brought about by the reassortment of complete viral gene segments. But while the mechanisms underlying the evolution of new influenza virus variants are relatively well understood, comparably less is known about the virus-host interactions that determine disease outcome.",

In the case of influenza virus, which encodes less than a dozen genes, hundreds of papers have been published on the viral NS1 protein, which has been reported to have numerous functions that can potentially impact virulence [1] . The viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes have also been implicated as virulence determinants, as have components of the viral polymerase. Although knowledge of viral protein function has been instrumental in the development of anti-influenza drugs, which include inhibitors of NA (oseltamivir and zanamivir) and the viral M2 ion channel (amantadine and rimantadine), drug-resistant influenza viruses continue to emerge and there remains a need for new and effective antiviral therapies [2] . Similarly, challenges remain in developing influenza vaccines that are protective across a broad range of strains, as the most effective vaccines promote an immune response against HA, which is the most variable of the viral proteins [3] .",

While this is not a new question, finding the answer took on renewed urgency with the first reports of human infection with avian H5N1 viruses [10, 11] . In the initial outbreak in Hong Kong, 6 of 18 infected individuals died, and \"bird flu\" became an international concern. Since then, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses have continued to appear throughout Southeast Asia and into Europe and Africa with hundreds more human infections and a mortality rate of up to 60% [12, 13] . The possibility that such a virus could acquire the ability to readily transmit between humans is justifiable cause for concern. Research on the mechanisms underlying highly virulent influenza virus infection gained further momentum with the reconstruction of the 1918 pandemic virus [14] , a virus responsible for the greatest infectious disease outbreak in human history and over 50 million deaths worldwide [15] . Not surprisingly, the reconstructed 1918 virus and avian H5N1 strains have also become a prominent focus of genomic and systems-level analyses aimed at understanding the virus-host interactions underlying severe respiratory virus infection.",

At the genomic level, the lungs of these animals exhibited an early (day 1) increase in the expression of cytokine, chemokine, and apoptosis-related genes, including genes associated with death receptor, IL-6, type I IFN, and Toll-like receptor responses. This response was unique to the r1918-infected animals and was not observed in the lungs of mice infected with a contemporary (and less pathogenic) H1N1 strain.

The first experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with r1918 resulted in acute respiratory distress and death, with all animals euthanized by day 8 due to the severity of symptoms [17] . Genomic analysis of bronchial tissue from r1918-infected animals (chosen because of less immune cell infiltration than in the lung) also revealed an early and sustained induction of inflammatory cytokine (particularly IL-6) and chemokine genes, including CXCL1 , or highly pathogenic mouse-adapted 2009 H1N1, r1918, or avian H5N1 viruses. Expression values are represented as the average of the log2 ratio of infected to respective mock-infected samples for three biological replicates per condition. Red and green indicate that gene expression is increased or decreased relative to mock, respectively. and CXCL6, which are important for the recruitment of neutrophils. In contrast, macaques infected with a less pathogenic H1N1 strain showed increased expression of DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), type 1 IFN, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) early after infection, but this response was down-regulated at later time points as the animals recovered. Fewer ISGs were induced in r1918-infected macaques, but those that were induced retained high levels of expression until the death of the animals. Interestingly, a similar lack of attenuation of early immune activation leading to death is observed in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, indicating that uncontrolled immune responses might be a general mechanism of pathogenicity across a wide range of viruses and hosts [18] .",

However, in mice, it is the H5N1 virus that elicits strong induction of inflammasome genes. The H5N1 virus also disseminated to the brain and spleen, and a computational approach identified a correlation between tissue dissemination and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory responses and the down-regulation of antiinflammatory genes.

In vitro systems have further been used to examine the extent to which the transcription factor NF-B, a major regulator of inflammatory gene expression, has on the host response to H5N1 infection [30] . Infecting primary human endothelial cells in the presence or absence of a dominant negative mutant of IB kinase 2, which blocks the activation of NF-B, revealed that the majority of H5N1-induced genes were NF-B-dependent. Some genes, such as IFN-\u2424, were strictly NF-B-dependent, whereas others were only partially dependent upon NF-B for their induction.

Coupled with targeted siRNA knockdown, these analyses confirmed the role of IRF3 in H5N1 induction of IFN response genes and also identified a requirement for the transcription factors HMGA1 and NFATC4 in mediating the strong inflammatory response induced by H5N1 infection.

The two most prominent networks identified included genes associated with the immune response or keratinization processes.

Yet as reviewed elsewhere [33] , despite efforts to target the host response with a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs, this approach has been largely unsuccessful. At least part of the difficulty may rest with the timing at which anti-inflammatory or immunomodulating drugs are administered. Just as genomic profiling studies have revealed that the timing and duration of the inflammatory response is an important factor in disease outcome, so too is it likely that the timing at which elements of the host response are suppressed or enhanced through drug therapy needs to be carefully controlled. With the increasing sophistication of computational approaches, one challenge for the future will be to garner a deeper understanding of the rapidly changing dynamics of the immune response (see Section 10). This may lead to rational improvements in both the targets and timing of immunomodulatory therapy.",

Although most infections were mild, some individuals had severe symptoms, and the virus was clearly capable of rapid human-tohuman transmission.

Gene expression profiling of lung tissue from these animals revealed the induction of numerous genes related to the inflammatory response, and in animals infected with the virus causing more severe clinical symptoms, there was also up-regulation of a network of NF-B signaling molecules, which correlated with increased pro-inflammatory plasma cytokine levels (e.g., IL-6 and MCP-1) early after infection. However, unlike r1918 or H5N1 infection, these responses resolved and the animals recovered from infection.

This makes the pig a unique model for the future generation of more detailed high-throughput and systems level analyses that may help to identify unique aspects of the host response that make pigs largely resistant to the effects of the r1918 virus. Such knowledge could be used to rationally design therapeutic approaches to suppress or augment targeted aspects of the host response in macaques or other animal models (and eventually humans) to mitigate pathogenic outcome.",

To study the relationship between viral and bacterial infection, Kash et al. used a model in which mice were infected with either a 2009 seasonal isolate or a 2009 pandemic virus followed by inoculation with Streptococcus pneumoniae [47] . All mice infected with virus alone survived the infection and exhibited similar lung transcriptional profiles characterized by moderate increases in inflammatory gene expression. Animals infected with the seasonal virus plus S. pneumonia also survived infection, whereas bacterial co-infection with the 2009 pandemic virus resulted in 100% mortality. Interestingly, lethal bacterial co-infection was not accompanied by a significant increase in the inflammatory response, but rather was characterized by increased basal epithelial cell apoptosis and a lack of cellular gene transcription associated with re-proliferation and repair (a transcriptional response that was elicited by the seasonal virus). Thus, the extent to which bacterial co-infection increases morbidity and mortality appears to be at least in part dependent upon the virus-host interactions that lead to lung injury and subsequent repair.",

In all cases, this increase in gene expression resolves during later stages of infection and tissue repair and recovery responses ensue. In vitro analyses using a lung epithelial cell line [49] or primary human alveolar epithelial cells [50] have also revealed a transient increase in inflammatory and IFN response genes. These observations once more point to the dynamics of the host immune response as being essential to outcome and underline the importance of good timing of therapeutic intervention. With increasing evidence of synergy between different pathogens, the infectious history of the host also emerges as a major determinant of pathology.

One of the first studies to profile the transcriptional response of a knockout mouse to influenza virus infection looked at the role of P58 IPK , an inhibitor of the eIF2\u2423 kinases PKR and PERK, which respectively function to regulate protein synthesis during virus infection and the unfolded protein response [54] . Infection of P58 IPK -knockout mice with a mouse-adapted virus, or with r1918, resulted in greatly amplified expression of inflammatory and apoptotic response genes, providing the first evidence that P58 IPK functions during virus infection to inhibit the over-activation of inflammatory and cell death responses.",

To examine the impact of deficiencies in the key inflammatory mediators TNF and IL1 on virus infection, mice containing gene knockouts in the receptors for these molecules were infected with the r1918 virus [55] . Although the virus was lethal in all animals, TNF receptor knockout mice survived statistically longer than wild-type mice and exhibited delayed or decreased expression of genes associated with antiviral and innate immune signaling and negative acute-phase response. IL1 receptor knockout mice, in contrast, exhibited an increase in the expression of genes associated with dendritic and natural killer cell processes and a compensatory increase in TNF expression.

In addition, while the abundance of proteins involved in the immune response, metabolism, and transport increased rapidly after infection with the H5N1 virus, this response was delayed in the animals infected with the less pathogenic viruses. To a large extent, these findings mirror the results of genomic analyses [19] and reinforce the hypothesis that the dynamics of immune activation are essential to disease outcome.",

The first such study established an influenza virus infection system using Drosophila cells, and after screening a RNAi library against over 13,000 genes, identified 110 genes whose suppression impacted reporter gene expression from a modified influenza virus [77] . Subsequent studies using mammalian cell RNAi screens identified 133 [78] , 295 [79] , and 287 [80] genes encoding proteins that affected various steps in the viral life cycle ranging from entry and uncoating to assembly and budding. In a variation on this approach, Shapira et al. [81] used the results from yeast two-hybrid analysis and gene expression profiling of influenza virus-infected primary human bronchial epithelial cells to computationally predict factors and pathways that affect the viral life cycle. These predictions were then tested by suppressing the expression of these genes through RNAi, resulting in 616 genes whose products affected influenza virus replication. Together, these studies identified cellular factors involved in a variety of functions, including cellular signaling, translation initiation, and nuclear transport.",

No prior knowledge or annotation of the gene is necessary, and the result can be either knock-down or over-expression of the gene. The approach generates a library of independent clones that can be screened for a desired phenotype. In this case, the isolation of clones resistant to killing by influenza virus yielded 110 human genes.

This low degree of overlap could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in screening systems, cell types, and viruses and was also observed in RNAi screens used to identify host factors for HIV-1 replication, where only three genes were identified by all three screens [85] . Importantly, concordance might also be affected by the statistical prioritization approaches used and might be generally hampered by a large number of host factors falling within a narrow band of positive or negative correlation with pathogenicity, reminiscent of the challenges faced by gene signature definition [86] . Moreover, only a handful of the genes identified have been subjected to functional analyses to confirm their role in influenza virus replication.

In a more comprehensive approach, Nakaya et al. evaluated innate and adaptive immune responses to vaccination against influenza virus using blood samples obtained over a 3-year period from individuals receiving a trivalent inactivated vaccine or a live attenuated vaccine [92] . Although the clinical effectiveness of these vaccines was similar, only the live attenuated vaccine induced robust expression of genes associated with an IFN response (as did only the live vaccine in the macaque study described above). In contrast, the inactivated vaccine induced higher antibody titers, and only the inactivated vaccine induced the expression of genes associated with a plasma B cell response.

The viruses used in these studies caused clinical outcomes that ranged from 100% survival to 100% lethality, and the goal of the analysis was to identify gene expression signatures with the capacity to segregate and predict mild or highly pathogenic infections. A series of computational techniques generated signatures that were either oppositely expressed (referred to as a \"digital\" relationship) or that were expressed on a continuum (referred to as an \"analog\" relationship) when comparing mild and highly pathogenic infections. The best predictor of a highly pathogenic infection was a 57-gene analog signature that included the induction of genes associated with the inflammatory response and chemokine signaling and decreased expression of genes associated with lung repair. The analog nature of this signature indicates that highly pathogenic viruses (including r1918, avian H5N1 viruses, and SARS coronavirus) induce or suppress the expression of many of the same genes as mildly pathogenic viruses, but to a much greater degree. The magnitude of the host response, rather than the induction or suppression of a unique set of genes, therefore appears to be a critical factor in determining disease outcome.",

This study used three complementary approaches: functional similarity analysis, the identification of patterns of coexpression between systems, and a network inference method to identify conserved regulatory influences. Because these approaches do not rely on matching comparable time points between experiments, they can be used to compare data from systems with different sampling times and dynamics. These combined approaches identified functions and pathways that displayed similar behavior or regulation across all three systems, most notably in IFN and inflammatory responses, indicating that significant portions of the response to influenza virus are conserved across cell culture, mouse, and macaque models. Predicted regulatory influences driving this response included GTF2B (a factor also known as TFIIB and targeted by a number of viruses to disrupt transcriptional initiation) and ATF4 (a transcription factor involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response). Overall, this study demonstrates the ability of computational approaches to reveal relationships between in vitro and in vivo systems and for gaining deeper insight into biological responses to infection through the use of pre-existing data sets. It also serves to bolster the muchdebated relevance of cell culture systems for predicting responses in animal models. In the future, it will also be interesting to focus on host-specific differences and to gain insight into the variability of pathogenicity as a function of host genetics.",

Three somewhat unexpected themes of viral pathology have emerged from the initial application of systems approaches: (i) pathogenicity is to a larger-than-expected extent a function of host genetics and likely infectious history [13] , (ii) low versus high pathogenicity is not so much a function of different host gene networks responding to the infection but rather similar or identical networks responding to a different degree [96] , and (iii) chronic, non-attenuated activation of these networks highly correlates with outcome, and attenuation might be kinetically controlled as a function of the dynamics of the virus-host interaction [18] . All three observations can be reconciled into a single hypothesis of time-dependent encoding of host responses, making the timing of components of the host response of utmost importance for the virus-host interactions themselves and for disease outcome and treatment (Fig. 5 ).",

Few data are currently available that follow molecular events over time, and even less so on the appropriate time scales. Immune activation is a process that happens on a single-cell level within minutes to hours rather than hours to days. It will therefore be necessary to generate omics data with high time resolution during the early and relevant transition phases of immune activation. Acquisition of such data faces technical challenges and is limited by problems of synchronization of events, cells, and tissues. However, novel computational approaches should be able to overcome these difficulties. Geometric approaches, for instance low-dimensional, non-linear representations of gene networks based on their activity [98] , can be used to renormalize poorly time-resolved data to absolute references (pre-infection versus post-infection; low-pathogenicity versus high-pathogenicity; ressortant versus wild-type viruses) and therefore reinterpret activity differences as differences in observation time. Even more interesting in this context are continuous-time Markov processes defined on a path space spanned by low-resolution experiments. Here, the few available experimental data points over time are expanded through inference methodology allowing approximation and subsequent comparisons of the system's internal time dynamics across different viruses or genetic variants. In order to be successful, these methods will require, in addition to the available data sets, the generation of data from controlled experiments in cell culture systems where key components of immune activation networks are studied individually.",

In order to better understand the molecular network structure and dynamics leading to immune responses, redundancy in these networks, and the relative importance of highly connected (\"hubs\") as well as sparse regions of the networks (\"bottlenecks\"), is required to quantify robustness at the level of individual network components. To this end, Collaborative Cross mice and human population genetic studies will provide sources of genetic variability of the host.

Such modeling will be required to develop better screening of effective drugs once high-priority targets have been established through the above approaches. To this end, the multi-agent systems (MAS) paradigm shows great promise. MAS aims to model complex systems by the use of autonomous programs, named agents, which have independent behaviors and which interact among each other or with a virtual environment [103, 104] . MAS has been applied in social science, economics, and ecology to solve problems such as collective decision making, process optimization, or the analysis of emerging properties. In the context of system biology, MAS represents a system that can simulate the biological mechanisms involved between the major actors of the host immune response across different scales. On a macroscopic level, cell-to-cell and virus-cell interactions and communications can be modeled and integrated with a microscopic level that captures the dynamics of signaling and the triggering of metabolic pathways. Such modeling will help to refine the most important components involved during infection and contribute to a better understanding of emerging properties. Different MAS platforms [105] [106] [107] have already been used to model host immune responses and physical interactions at a single-cell level [108] [109] [110] [111] . Once a better understanding of network sub-structures and dynamics is achieved, better parameter sets will be available to increase the effectiveness of such models in the systematic in silico exploration of virus-host networks in view of possible drug targets and theoretical targeting strategies.",

Many of these RNAs are similarly regulated by IFN treatment, suggesting that long noncoding RNAs may be involved in regulating the host response, including innate immunity. Similarly, there is increasing evidence that microRNAs play a role in the host response to numerous viruses [116] , including influenza virus [117] . Next-generation sequencing has also revealed that additional forms of small noncoding RNAs, such as small nuclear RNAs (snoRNAs) and piwi-associated small RNAs (piRNA), are also differentially expressed in response to influenza virus infection [118] . Moreover, noncoding RNAs have been found to directly regulate protein function, as exemplified by the identification of the 7SK snRNA as a regulator of HMGA1 function [119] . Nextgeneration sequencing is therefore adding a critical new analytical component that may alter the way we think about virus-host interactions and gene regulatory mechanisms.

Although slower to come to the infectious disease field, the approach has made substantial inroads into influenza virus research, as the studies described in this review attest. An influx of new investigators, together with ongoing improvements to computational methods and technologies, should continue to propel the field forward. As an additional driver, the approach has also received support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which has funded four systems biology centers, including two focused on influenza virus [120] . Influenza virus, with its ability to evolve in surprising new ways, is certain to be a threat well into the future. Similarly, the methods used to study this virus must continue to evolve if we are to develop the methods of surveillance, vaccination, and therapy needed to protect the public health.",
