Note if the patient will be staying in air-conditioned hotel versus open-air accommodations, in urban versus rural setting, or participating in high-altitude or adventure travel. Patients who anticipate adventure travel to rabies-endemic areas may require preexposure vaccination. Some accommodations indicate increased risk of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, tickborne encephalopathy, and Japanese encephalitis (JE). Rural, remote destinations increase the need for heightened food and water vigilance to prevent foodborne illness. 2 Country-and region-specific recommendations must also be considered. Travelers to the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa should be advised to receive meningitis vaccination as should pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia during the Hajj or Umrah. 4 Destination information will guide in the provision of appropriate antibiotics for self-administration if the patient experiences travelers' diarrhea while abroad. The quinolones, once thought of as the primary medications for use in the empiric treatment of uncomplicated travelers' diarrhea, are no longer effective in regions of Southeast Asia or the Caribbean, related to resistance patterns in Camplyobacter and cholera isolates. 5, 6 Prophylactic antimalarial medication choice will be driven by the distribution of Plasmodium strains found in the destination. Chloroquine resistance is common in many parts of the world, making this once standard of care ineffective in multiple locales. In the presence of chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria, doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, or mefloquine could be used to aid malaria prevention. Each medication has a side effect profile to be weighed against the patient's history and current medication regimen to offer the best prescribing match. 7",

Yellow fever (YF), malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, JE, and West Nile virus are all spread by the bite from a mosquito. Ticks transmit Lyme disease, tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other rickettsial diseases, ehrlichiosis, and the newly identified Heartland virus. 9 Flies can spread leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis (river blindness), and African trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness). The triatomine bug is implicated in the spread of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) with fleas implicated as vectors for bubonic plague and freshwater aquatic snails spreading diseases such as schistosomiasis. 8 Although vaccinations exist for some vectorborne diseases such as YF and JE, many diseases have none. Others, such as tick-borne encephalitis, have vaccinations only available outside of the US, making vaccination impractical for leisure travelers. The prevention of vector-borne diseases includes avoidance of at-risk areas and behaviors coupled with consistent insecticide and repellant use. 10 Instruct travelers to avoid wading in freshwater rivers, lakes, and streams to prevent contact with waterborne infectious agents. Travelers should not sleep in adobe brick and palm thatch huts while in South America to lessen exposure to the triatomine bugs associated with Chagas disease. Travelers should be taught to wear long sleeve woven shirts, long pants, and hats to provide a barrier to stinging and biting insects. Further precautionary measures include treating clothing with permethrin repellant and applying insecticide to skin. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend using insecticides containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 to aid in insect bite reduction. 10, 11 Sleeping in air conditioning and avoiding outside activities from dusk to dawn decreases the likelihood of exposure to malarial mosquitoes. If air conditioning is not available in malaria risk areas, travelers should sleep under permethrin-treated mosquito netting and use tight screening in the windows of their sleeping area.",

In 2012, an estimated 627,000 people died of malaria worldwide, disproportionately impacting children in sub-Saharan Africa. In the US, approximately 1,500 to 2,000 cases of malaria are identified annually. Between 1957 and 2011, 63 outbreaks of locally transmitted malaria occurred in the US. These outbreaks were brought into the US by international travelers who were infected abroad, allowing the parasite to be transferred to a new local person through a mosquito bite. Malaria can also spread from mother to unborn child, sharing used needles, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. 7 Symptoms of infection generally occur between 10 days and 4 weeks after infection, although some report symptoms as early as 7 days postinfection or up to 1 year later. Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale can have a remitting and exacerbating symptomatology, which can further complicate diagnosis. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, back pain, headache, anemia, jaundice, neurologic changes including dizziness and confusion, and coma leading to death if not properly identified and treated. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi are considered the most lethal of all known human Plasmodium species with a rapid progressive illness pattern that quickly deteriorates to neurologic symptoms and death.",

P falciparum and Plasmodium malarie are distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, P vivax is predominantly in Asia and Latin America and limitedly in Africa, P ovale is found primarily in West Africa and the islands of the Western Pacific, and P knowlesi has been identified in Southeast Asia and Malaysia. Confirmatory testing is needed so the appropriate treatment regimen can be initiated. 7 Determine the treatment approach for malaria with the following stepwise approach: proper identification of the infecting Plasmodium species, the patient's clinical status, and Plasmodium drug susceptibility. Malaria is identified via the use of thick and thin blood smears with staining. The interpretation of smears needs to be performed immediately after collection by a clinician familiar with malaria. One negative blood smear does not preclude the diagnosis of malaria, but rather repeat smears should be completed every 12-24 hours for a total of 3 sets. If three sets of smears, prepared and read by a qualified technologist, are read as negative, the diagnosis of malaria can be ruled out. If Plasmodium is identified on stained smears, the parasite density should be estimated via microscopy. Polymerase chain reaction testing is done to finalize the determination of species and drug resistance. The CDC will perform testing and offer treatment regimens for all cases of malaria diagnosed in the US. 12 Dengue Fever Dengue fever is caused by a single-stranded RNA flavivirus transmitted to humans by a bite from the Aedes aegypti mosquito primarily and to a lesser degree Aedes albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis, and Aedes scutellaris mosquitoes. Dengue virus (DENV) has four distinct serotypes identified with a wide spectrum of clinical symptomatology. DENV is the most common arbovirus with an estimate of over 100 million infections annually worldwide. DENV has been identified in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Caribbean. 13, 14 DENV symptoms range from asymptomatic infection to severe disease with shock and hemorrhage. Symptoms include fever, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, positive petechiae via the tourniquet test, laboratory abnormalities of leukopenia, increased hematocrit, and a rapid decrease in platelet count. 14 DENV can progress to severe organ impairment, shock, hemorrhage, and fluid accumulation with respiratory distress. Many cases of DENV go unreported and undiagnosed because they often occur in regions where malaria is also endemic. DENV has no vaccination and no curative treatment regimen, with supportive care only for symptom management. If a patient has traveled to a malaria-endemic region and malaria has been ruled out, other causes of internationally acquired illness must be explored. Even if malaria has been confirmed, coinfection with DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) cannot be excluded without further diagnostic testing. [13] [14] [15] Chikungunya Fever Chikungunya fever is caused by an alphavirus that transmits to humans via a bite from the A aegypti or A albopictus mosquito. CHIKV infection begins with vague complaints of febrile illness with fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, and rash. The characteristic that often differentiates CHIKV symptoms from DENV is severe persistent joint pain. No hemorrhagic symptomatology is noted with CHIKV, and infection is rarely fatal. Treatment focuses on supportive care and symptom management. CHIKV has been identified in Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Caribbean. DENV and CHIKV infections are often mistaken for the other and commonly overlooked for malaria. Symptoms can appear between 2 and 12 days after infection and typically occur within 3-7 days. CHIKV confers lifelong immunity to reinfection regardless of symptomatology. 15, 16 ",

Symptoms of YF begin 3-6 days after infection and include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia and may progress to jaundice, hemorrhagic complications, shock, multisystem organ failure, and death. 10 Proof of vaccination is an entry requirement for many countries and will require an official YF document be provided from a certified YF clinic. YF is a live vaccine and should not be given to pregnant women; children under the age of 6 months; or anyone with an immune-altering condition, allergies to eggs, chicken proteins, or gelatin. Additionally, conditions such as DiGeorge syndrome, myasthenia gravis, a thymoma, or surgical removal of the thymus are absolute contraindications to vaccination. If a patient is over 60 years of age or between the ages of 6-8 months, special consideration of the true risk of disease in an area need to be weighed against potential complications from the vaccine. 10 It is not uncommon for the risk of disease to be much different from the entry requirement documents of a specific country. If a patient is found to be inappropriate for vaccination, a YF clinic can issue a deferment certificate. NPs in primary care should refer any patient traveling to Africa or South America to a YF clinic for evaluation of the potential need for vaccination or documentation of YF deferment status. Additionally, if the patient's trip will take them through a YF country, even with just an airplane layover stop, vaccination or documentation may be required. The YF clinic will make the determination of vaccination or documentation needs and provide the necessary certificate to the traveler. The YF certification document is valid for 10 years after the date of issue. A list of YF clinics can be found on the CDC Web site. 10 Typhoid Fever. Typhoid fever (TF) is a bacterial illness caused by Salmonella typhi. Ingestion of food or water contaminated by feces via either food handling by infected carriers or direct inoculation is the most common route. An estimated 21 million people contract TF worldwide, and over 200,000 will die from the disease annually. 19 Of those infected, approximately 3%-5% will become chronic carriers who are asymptomatic yet capable of spreading the disease. TF is endemic in developing countries worldwide and is common in all but the most industrialized nations such as the US, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan. Symptoms of TF include a fever of 39 C-40 C, weakness, abdominal pain, headache, anorexia, and, in some cases, a rose-colored spotted rash. TF is definitively diagnosed via blood and stool sampling for the presence of S typhi. 19 Vaccination is available in a live oral or an inactivated injectable form. Do not give the live oral form to children younger than 6 years old; persons with immune-altering conditions, serious gastrointestinal disease, active nausea, or vomiting; or patients on oral antibiotics. Oral typhoid vaccination can be given without consideration of spacing of other live vaccinations. Patients take the live oral vaccination in four capsules, with one capsule taken by mouth every other day, on an empty stomach with a full glass of water. A booster is recommended every 5 years if exposure to typhus continues. The inactivated vaccination is given as one injection with booster recommended every 2 years if exposure to typhus continues. 19 Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. Measles outbreaks occur worldwide with recent outbreaks in the US, Philippines, Europe, and Brazil. The CDC reports a record number of 514 US measles cases reported from January 1 through June 20, 2014. Unvaccinated or underimmunized persons traveling abroad are frequently the transporter of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases into the US after visiting areas where these illnesses are common. 20 Measles are highly contagious and easily spread via the respiratory tract from 1 person to another. Symptoms typically occur 7-14 days after exposure and generally present with a mild to moderate fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and conjunctivitis. Three to five days after the early symptoms first appear, a blotchy rash and high fever occur and are often accompanied by increasing malaise and Koplik spots in the mouth and throat. The rash typically begins at the hairline and spreads downward over the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. As the fever subsides, the rash fades. A person with measles is contagious for approximately 4 days before and up to 4 days after the rash appears. 20 Advise international travelers who transit into or through a country with a current outbreak to verify immunity via titer or receive a booster of measles vaccination if not contraindicated.",
