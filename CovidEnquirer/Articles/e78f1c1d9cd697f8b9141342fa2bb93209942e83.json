Several putative functional domains such as a papain-like proteinase (PL pro ), main protease (M pro ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA helicase encoded by the replicase gene are important for virus replication. We have sequenced four regions of the replicase genes corresponding to the 5V-terminal sequence, PL pro , M pro , and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared them with previously published coronavirus sequences. All the coronavirus 5Vtermini and PL pro domains were divergent, unlike the M pro and the RdRp domains that were highly conserved with 28% and 48% conserved residues, respectively. Among IBV strains, the 5V untranslated region including the leader sequence was highly conserved (>94% identical); whereas, the N-terminal coding region and the PL pro domains were highly variable ranging from 84.6% to 100%, and 77.6% to 100% identity, respectively. The IBV M pro and RdRp domains were highly conserved with 82.7% and 92.7% conserved residues, respectively. The BJ strain was the most different from other IBVs in all four regions of the replicase. Phylogeny-based clustering based on replicase genes was identical to the antigen-based classification of coronaviruses into three groups. However, the IBV strain classification based on replicase gene domains did not correlate with that of the type-specific antigenic groups. The replicase gene sequences of many IBVs recovered from infected chickens were identical to those of vaccine viruses irrespective of serotype, suggesting that either there has been an exchange of genetic material among vaccine and field isolates or that there is a convergent evolution to a specific replicase genotype. There was no correlation between the genotype of any region of the replicase gene and pathotype, suggesting that the replicase is not the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity. D",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the prototype species of the family Coronaviridae, causes an acute and highly contagious disease of chickens. Numerous IBV strains exist, and clinical signs of the disease they cause vary from mild to severe. More than 20 IBV serotypes have been recognized worldwide, which are defined by crossreactivity among the structural proteins (Cowen and Hitchner, 1975; Hopkins, 1974) . Live vaccines containing strains of IBV from multiple serotypes are routinely used in commercial chicken flocks. Disease outbreaks in commer-cial flocks occur when new viruses emerge from existing viruses by mutations, insertions, deletions, or recombination (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Gelb et al., 1991; Kusters et al., 1990) . However, because these conclusions are based on available sequence from structural genes, viral evolution has only been described for this small part of the genome. Because only two IBVs have been fully sequenced, it has been impossible to fully understand the viral evolutionary process including the extent to which vaccine viruses have contributed genetic material to pathogenic field strains.",

This includes a genome-length mRNA (mRNA 1) of 27.6 kb and five sg species (mRNA 2 -6) with sizes ranging from 2 to 7 kb. These mRNAs form a 3V-co-terminal nested structure (Stern and Sefton, 1984) , each containing a short nontranslated leader sequence (64 nucleotides (nt)), derived from the 5V end of the genome by a discontinuous process. The phenomenon of leader switching has been described for several coronaviruses including IBV (Chang et al., 1994; Makino et al., 1988; Stirrups et al., 2000) . The mRNA 1 contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF 1a and 1b) encoding 441-and 300-kDa polyproteins, respectively . By a unique frameshifting mechanism, the downstream ORF 1b is produced as a fusion protein of 741 kDa with 1a (Brierley et al., 1987 (Brierley et al., , 1989 . These polyproteins are proteolytically processed into smaller products required for RNA synthesis and other aspects of viral replication. Four main structural proteins are encoded by sgmRNAs: the spike (S) glycoprotein (mRNA 2), the small envelope (E) protein (mRNA 3), the membrane (M) glycoprotein (mRNA 4), and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (mRNA 6) (Lai, 1990; Spaan et al., 1988; Sutou et al., 1988) . The S1 fragment of the spike protein carries antigenic epitopes that induce virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody, and also determines virus serotype .",

Proteolytic processing of the polyproteins by equivalent protease activities has been demonstrated in murine and human coronaviruses (reviewed in Lim et al., 2000; Ng and Liu, 2000) . Despite the conservation of function, there are some organizational differences in PL pro domains between IBV and some other coronaviruses (Herold et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1991) . Because of its key role in replicase gene expression, 3C-LP has been termed the coronavirus main protease (M pro ; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . The IBV PL pro domain-1 (PL1 pro ), encoded between nt 4243 and 5019 (aa 1239-1497), is responsible for cleavage of the N-terminal regions of 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins in IBV-infected cells, whereas the PL pro domain-2 (PL2 pro ) encoded between nt 4681 -5553 (aa 1385 -1675) is reported to be functionally inactive in IBV Lim et al., 2000; . A more important role in the processing of polyproteins is played by the M pro , which is responsible for the cleavage of other regions of the ORF 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins (Liu et al., 1994 (Liu et al., , 1997 Liu, 1998, 2002) . The catalytic center of both proteinases consists of His and Cys residues in all coronaviruses (reviewed in Lim et al., 2000; Ng and Liu, 2000) . The processed products constitute a group of replicative enzymes, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA helicase. Therefore, the significance of the coronavirus leader sequence and several putative functional domains essential for viral replication made them logical choices for sequence analysis and phylogenetic comparisons to correlate with the serological or pathological classification of coronaviruses.",

However, within the group 3 coronaviruses, no comparisons of replicase-based and antigen-based phylogenies have been made. One report has described the alignment of the 5V-proximal region of replicase genes from a limited number of IBV strains (Stirrups et al., 2000) , and a few reports describe IBV M pro and RdRp domains from the Beaudette strain only (Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002; Stephensen et al., 1999) . Here, we have sequenced four regions of the replicase gene corresponding to the 5Vterminal end, PL pro , M pro , and RdRp domains from 20 heterologous IBV strains, and compared then with previously published IBV and other coronavirus sequences. We present evidence that (i) the M pro and RdRp regions are highly conserved among all coronaviruses unlike the 5Vterminal sequence and PL pro domains, (ii) the clustering of heterologous IBV strains based on the replicase gene sequences does not correlate with the antigen-based S1 phylogeny, (iii) several widely used IBV vaccines and field strains isolated over the past decade have closely related replicase genes suggestive of a possible common ancestry or a converging evolution, and (iv) the replicase gene is unlikely to be the sole determinant of IBV pathogenicity.",

The sequence distance data (Table 1 ) obtained from the whole 5V UTR (nt 1 -528) indicate that nt sequence identities were 94 -100% among all IBV strains in this region. The N-terminal coding region (nt 529-1263) of the 5V terminal sequence is more variable with the lowest identity represented by the BJ strain at 84.6-86% identity with the other strains. Pairwise comparisons of the N-terminal sequences from other strains revealed 89.7-100% identity irrespective of serotype, geographic source, and virulence (Table 1 ). The challenge strain NV M41 is identical to the vaccine strain M41 in the noncoding region but in the coding region has a single nt change that results in an amino acid change (data not shown). These relationships are graphically shown in the phylogenetic tree created from the nt sequences of the entire 5V terminal region (Fig. 2a) .

            "text": "Coronaviruses fall into three antigenic groups (Dea et al., 1990) , which are defined by cross-reactivity among the structural proteins. Unlike the structural proteins, the coronavirus replicase gene is not subjected to immune selective pressure. Therefore, one would expect that the replicase gene would be highly conserved among coronavirus groups. In fact, this is the case when the M pro and RdRp sequences are compared (Table 3 ) and as others have reported for other coronavirus groups (Chouljenko et al., 2001; Gonzalez et al., 2003; Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002; Stephensen et al., 1999) . We found a high percentage of sequence similarities in coronavirus M pro (with 28% absolutely conserved residues), including the substrate recognition site, and an even higher similarity in the RdRp (with 48% absolutely conserved residues), including the polymerase motifs. However, two-way sequence comparisons of the coronavirus 5V-termini and the PL pro domains of ORF1a had very low sequence identity between coronaviruses of different groups as has been reported by others (Herold et al., 1999) . Despite the fact that these regions have varying degrees of genetic diversity, the relationships between the coronaviruses of different groups are the same, no matter what region of the genome is compared. When recombination occurs (Cavanagh and Davis, 1988) , it would seem to occur within the major coronaviruses antigenic groups, but not between them. This is expected because in order for recombination to occur, two viruses must be present in the same cell, which is unlikely between coronaviruses adapted to different host species. The highly conserved M pro -mediated processing pathways as well as the substrate binding sites of this enzyme in all coronaviruses (Anand et al., 2003; Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002) make this proteinase an attractive target for the development of drugs directed against coronaviruses. The active domains of RdRp also maintain a high degree of homology among all coronaviruses, as has been found in other RNA viruses (Koonin and Dolja, 1993; Otsuka et al., 1999) , making this proteinase another potential target for drugs controlling coronaviruses.",

For example, unlike the S1 genes, the replicase genes of the Ma5 and H52 Mass serotype viruses consis-tently clustered with those of non-Mass strains (Figs. 2ad) . The common clustering of replicase genes of these heterologous IBV strains could be due to an introduction of a replicase gene from a common source through introduction. Others have speculated that IBV strains substitute large genomic fragments in multiple genes (Lee and Jackwood, 2000) because the viability of the progeny viruses depends on the specific interactions of more than one gene working in concert to maintain structural and replicative integrity. Alternatively, it is probably more likely that the smaller S1 genes are exchanged between viruses through recombination and the stable replicase backbone is maintained. It is entirely possible that recombination events have occurred to introduce new replicase or new S1 genes into these viruses.",

The phenomenon of leader switching involves a recombination event over a region comprising the leader sequence and the adjacent 5V UTR (Chang et al., 1996) . Previous reports have suggested that the leader sequences of IBV strains may contain higher (17.2%) substitution rates when compared to the complete 5V UTR (4.3%; Stirrups et al., 2000) . In our study, the 5V UTR of all 22 IBV strains are highly conserved (94 -100% identity), indicating the exchange of leader or adjacent 5V UTR fragments has occurred in mixed infections. This observation is supported by experimental evidence of the exchange of leader sequences among heterologous IBV strains (Stirrups et al., 2000) and in mixed MHV infections (Makino et al., 1986) . The sequence comparison scores are more variable in the N-terminal coding region (Table 1) , and the most in PL pro domains (Table 2) including a more variable region in the latter (Fig.  3 ) than the IBV M pro and RdRp domains ( Table 3 ).

            "text": "The genetic variations in the 5V terminal region and PL pro gene suggest that there is some selective pressure on these regions. We speculate that there are some replicase genotypes that may confer a selective advantage to the virus. We examined both the 5V terminal region and the PL pro gene by year and location of isolation, but excluded the M pro and RdRp genes because they are so highly conserved that no clear differences between isolates can be discerned. In the 5V terminal region and the PL pro gene, the IBV strains isolated from commercial chickens over the past decade cluster with three specific vaccine virus strains, ArkDPI, H52, and Ma5, no matter where in the United States they were isolated. There are three exceptions to this clustering, the 5V terminal region of the Gray virus isolated in 1960 (Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962) clusters with modern field strains (Fig. 2a) , although its PL pro gene is more like the Conn and Florida reference viruses isolated in 1956 and 1971, respectively (Jungherr et al., 1956; Winterfield et al., 1971) (Fig. 2b ). In addition, there are two modern field isolates, one from China (BJ) and one from California (K1699) isolated in 2003 and 2001, respectively, that are outliers and do not appear to have 5V termini or PL pro genes that are related to other viruses (Figs. 2a and b) . This common clustering of three widely used vaccines and IBV field isolates from the past decade suggests to us that there may be a common evolutionary progression in the 5V terminal region and in the PL pro gene. Although the 5V terminal region genotype found in modern isolates was present in 1960, when the Gray virus was isolated, it appears to be more prevalent today. The question arises as to why this type of progression to a specific genotype would have occurred and how it could have happened. As to the question of why, we speculate that the more modern genotype must offer some fitness advantage to the virus. As to how it could have occurred, we consider the widespread use of multiple types of modified live vaccines in both the broiler and egg layer commercial poultry industries as the possible mechanism by which this modern replicase gene genotype was introduced. The Ark, Conn, and Mass (Ma5, H52) strains have been used simultaneously as live vaccines among commercial poultry (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . Although we cannot prove or disprove that recombination has occurred, we can point to the evolutionary trends in the S1 gene as compared to the evolutionary trends in the replicase gene. The trends in S1 evolution have been toward ever increasing diversity (Jia et al., 2002) , while it appears that the replicase gene is evolving to less variety between isolates. These juxtaposed evolutionary trends suggest that (1) these two regions are under very different selective pressures and thus undergo much different rates and modes of change, and (2) the exchange of genetic material may have occurred between vaccine strains and field isolates.",

The role of the replicase gene in the virulence of IBV has not been established, and it is likely that some changes in the M pro or viral polymerase would influence viral replication rate, and thus the pathogenic potential of a virus. In some RNA viruses, replicase genes are known to contain the determinants of species tropism and virulence factors (Brandt et al., 2001; Hatta et al., 2001; Yao et al., 2001) . In our study, there were no differences in any essential residues in M pro and RdRp domains. In addition, we found that there was no clear relationship between viral pathotype and replicase genotype. As an example, the H52 vaccine strain is very closely related to the virulent DE072 isolate in all regions of the replicase (99.8% identity in the 5V terminus, 99.5% in PL pro , 99.3% in M pro , 99.6% in RdRp) despite their differences in pathotype. In addition, a direct comparison of the replicase genes of the M41 challenge and vaccine strains where there were very few aa differences between the two strains with clearly different pathotypes. None of the aa changes between the two M41 strains were consistently observed in either all virulent or all avirulent strains. These findings would support our contention that the genotype of the replicase is not the sole determinant of pathogenicity among strains of IBV.",
