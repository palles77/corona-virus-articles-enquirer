The finding of positive RT-PCR results from stools of SARS patients suggests that stools of SARS patients or sewage containing stools of patients could transmit SARS-CoV. We used a novel style of electropositive filter media particle to concentrate the SARS-CoV from the sewage of two hospitals receiving SARS patients in Beijing. We also used cell culture, RT-PCR and gene sequencing to detect and identify the viruses from sewage. No infectious SARS-CoV contamination was found in any of the samples collected, but the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV could be detected in the sewage from the two hospitals before disinfection. While the RNA was only detected in three samples from the 309th Hospital, the others were negative after disinfection. These findings provide strong evidence that SARS-CoV can be excreted through the stool/urine of patients into sewage system, thus making the sewage system a possible route of transmission.",

To identify viruses in sewage, a variety of specimens (sewage before or after disinfection by chlorine) were inoculated onto Vero E6. All cell cultures were grown in Eagle's growth medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) containing 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.015 M DMEM buffer and antibiotics (50 g [each] of kanamycin and gentamycin per milliliter), and maintained in the same medium with 1.5% FBS. For virus propagation and isolation, cell cultures in 75-cm 2 flasks were drained of medium, inoculated with 2 ml of sample, and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C with periodic rocking for viral adsorption. Because of the toxicity of most sewage, all cell cultures were inoculated in the presence of growth medium. Medium was replaced after 1-2 days of incubation. The culture was observed daily for cytopathic effect and terminated 7 days after inoculation. Any cultures exhibiting an identifiable cytopathic effect were subjected to several procedures to identify the cause of the effect (WHO, 2003c,d,e) . If there was no cytopathic effect in the cell culture, the culture suspensate was harvested and transferred into additional flasks to isolate viruses. The cultures were used for three generations without any observable cytopathic effect.",

Since f 2 is a kind of bacterial virus with a single-positive-stranded RNA (similar to SARS-CoV), and testing f 2 was simple and relatively inexpensive (Olivieri et al., 1975) , f 2 was chosen as a model for SARS-CoV to evaluate the concentration efficiency. Because most enteroviruses can also grow on the Vero cell, and yield a cytopathic effect similar to that of the SARS-CoV, enteroviruses must be first excluded from all the viruses that can grow on the Vero cell culture or yield a cytopathic effect.",

The patients in these hospitals were all beyond the acute phase, and most had recovered from SARS. The following reasons may be responsible for the negative results: (1) the SARS-CoV was inactivated by the high concentration of disinfectants, which were used after a patient had a bowel movement; (2) the quantity of SARS-CoV was too low to be detected by the current methods; (3) SARS-CoV may become non-infectious by unknown factors during the concentration process.",
