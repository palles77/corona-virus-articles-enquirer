            "text": "Two receptor binding variants of the influenza virus A/Tiibingen/l2/85 (HlNll were separated by their different plaque formation in MDCK cells. Hemagglutination of variant I was restricted to red blood cells of guinea pigs, whereas variant II also hemagglutinated chicken cells. The variants differed also in their ability to bind to cY2,6-linked sialic acid. Evidence is presented that this difference is determined by a complex carbohydrate side chain at asparagine,,, near the receptor binding site which is absent in variant II. With both variants, the arginine found at the cleavage site of all other human isolates analyzed so far was replaced by lysine. for the virus before triggering penetration of the nucleocapsid into the cell (Klenk and Rott, 1988) . Therefore, host changes are often accompanied by changes in receptor specificity caused by an altered receptor binding site (RBS). Adaptation of the original virus isolate (0 phase) to a new host by selection of spontaneous virus variants (D phase) with different receptor binding characteristics was reported first by Burnet and Bull in 1943. Since that time a large number of influenza virus variants with different receptor binding capacities have been isolated by passages in different host cells or in the presence of RBS specific antibodies (Cohen and Biddle, 1960; Crecelius et al., 1984; Daniels et al., 1987; Gitelman et al., 1986; Katz and Webster, 1988; Katz et al., 1990; Oxford et al., 1987 Oxford et al., , 1990 Robertson et al., 1985 Robertson et al., , 1987 Robertson et al., , 1991 Schild et al., 1983) , by using various serum hemagglutination inhibitors (Rogers et al., 19831, or by binding to an artificial receptor (Rogers et al., 1985) . All these changes are due to HA mutations.",

Variants I and II differed in their receptor specificity, as shown in Table 1 . Red blood cells from guinea pigs bound all viruses analyzed, whereas untreated chicken cells agglutinated all Hl viruses except for variant I. To further elucidate the receptor specificity, desialylated chicken cells were reconstituted by sialic acid (SA) either in a2,3-or in (~2,6 linkage and then used for virus agglutination. In contrast to variant I, variant II recognizes sialic acid in (~2,6 linkage as do strains PR/8 and WSN. The ability of variant II to utilize SAa2,6Gal sequences agrees with previous findings for other Hl isolates since 1977, which all have this receptor specificity (Rogers and D'Souza, 1989) .

As only up to 98% of the primary structure could be characterized by the primer extension sequencing method, the residual sequences were determined by cloning and cytidine of the variant I is replaced by uridine. This exchange leads to isoleucine in the amino acid position 133 of the amino acid sequence of variant HA (Fig. 2) . The HA of the variant I possesses a threonine residue at that position, which provides a N-glycosylation signal in combination with the asparagine at position 131. Thus, the HA of the variant II has lost that N-glycosylation site. Both variants contain 6 glycosylation sites at the amino acid positions 21, 33, 95, 158, and 289 on HA, and 154 on HA, not affected by the change of receptor specificity (Fig. 2) . The asparagine at position 20 is not glycosylated (Waterfield et al., 19801 , because of sterical hindrance of the carbohydrate at asparagine,,. By using the primer extension method and T7 sequencing on the cloned gene fragments of both variants, lysine was surprisingly found to be the single amino acid, which connects HA, with HA, (Fig. 21 . We were interested to see whether other Hl viruses, isolated at the same time, also contain lysine at their HA cleavage sites. Therefore, additional virus isolates which we obtained from Tiibingen and Hannover in the same time course between 1985 and 1989, were analyzed at that critical site of HA on the level of vRNA and cDNA. However, only the Tiibingen/l2/85 isolate contained lysine at the HA cleavage site. All HAS of the other human influenza virus isolates analyzed so far, had a single arginine at that position. As a consequence of the unusual HA cleavage site of the A/ Tiibingen/ 12/S isolate, an endoproteinase specific for lysine should activate that influenza virus in vitro, but not-an enzyme specific for arginine. Therefore, HAS of variant II and, as controls, of two other influenza viruses with a corresponding arginine residue at that site were treated with either trypsin or endoproteinase Arg-C from mouse submaxillary gland or endoproteinase Lys-C from Lysobacter enzymogenes, respectively, and thereafter analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 3) . As expected, all viruses were activated by trypsin (Klenk et al., 19751. However, endoproteinase Arg-C did not cleave the HA of the Tiibingen isolate, whereas the HAS of the influenza A virus strains WSN and Virus N with a single arginine at that position were cleaved. Endoproteinase Lys-C degraded the HAS totally and was therefore unsuitable for proteolytic activation.",

Because the amino acid in position 133 is part of the RBS (Nobusawa et al., 19911, a change of this amino acid alone may modify receptor specificity. But it is more likely that the main structural alteration, the presence or absence of the carbohydrate side chain at that position, is critical for the shift in receptor specificity.

Thus, a variant of influenza A/USSR/90/77 (HlNl) virus has been described that differs from the original virus in its receptor binding capacity to blood cells from guinea pigs (Gitelman et al., 1986) . This difference was again caused by the carbohydrate side chain responsible for the receptor binding variation analyzed in the present study. A carbohydrate at the same position was also lost during egg-adaptation of an HlNl virus (Robertson et al., 1991) . Furthermore, a host cell mutant of influenza virus A/WSN (HlNl) that had acquired a carbohydrate at asparagine,,, (D eom et al., 19861 , two amino acids away from the carbohydrate attachment site of the Tiibingen variant 1, showed reduced binding to SAa2,3 and SAa2,6 receptors (Aytay and Schulze, 1991) . Changes in carbohydrates following egg adaptation were not only detected with Hl isolates but also with H3 isolates (Katz and Webster, 1988; Wang et al., 1989; Katz et al., 1990) and influenza B variants (Robertson et al., 1985; Oxford et al., 1990) . Taking all data together, these findings give strong evidence that the carbohydrates around the RBS play an important role for receptor specificity and determine the host tropism in some cases. Nevertheless, other amino acid substitutions without alterations of carbohydrates exist around the receptor binding domain in many influenza A and B viruses which affect the binding activities and specificities (Both et al., 1983; Rogers et al., 1983a,b; 1985; Naeve et al., 1984; Nobusawa and Nakajima, 1988; Katz and Webster, 1988; Suzuki et al., 1989; Katz et al., 1990; Nobusawa et al., 1991) .",

Such a cleavage site has been observed before only with the H14 serotype present in avian isolates (Kawaoka et al., 1990) . All other mammalian and apathogenic avian influenza viruses have a single arginine in this position. Arginine has also been found, when we analyzed the cleavage site of other human Hl isolates obtained in 1985 and subsequent years at various places in Germany (data not shown). Since trypsin which has been used in the isolation procedure of the A/Tiibingen/12/85 variants does not discriminate between lysine and arginine cleavage sites, it is not likely that there was selection pressure favouring a mutation from arginine to lysine during isolation. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the lysine cleavage site existed already in the original clinical specimen. The human alveolar system should therefore contain an appropriate protease to activate at lysine. Such an enzyme must also be present in the chick embryo which allows virus replication without substitution of exogenous protease. Whether the chick embryo enzyme is identical with the factor X-like activator of arginine sites described by Gotoh and co-workers (1990) remains to be seen (Ogasawara et al., 1992) . However, the data presented here show clearly that, depending on the presence of an arginine or a lysine at the cleavage site, the Hl hemagglutinin discriminates between activating proteases. It will be interesting to see whether such differences have an effect on the pathogenicity and other biological properties of the virus. ",
