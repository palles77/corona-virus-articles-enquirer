            "text": "Cost-effective and sensitive aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence detection capable of simply quantifying thrombin in human serum was developed using thrombin aptamer (TBA), one of the Gquadruplex DNA aptamers, without expensive nanoparticles and complicated procedures. Guanines of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) bound with thrombin do not react with 3,4, 5-trimethoxylphenylglyoxal (TMPG) in the presence of tetra-n-propylammonium hydroxide (TPA), whereas guanines of free TBA-and TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of graphene oxide rapidly react with TMPG to emit light. Thus, guanine chemiluminescence in 5% human serum with thrombin was lower than that without thrombin when TBA-conjugated 6-FAM was added in two samples and incubated for 20 min. In other words, the brightness of guanine chemiluminescence was quenched due to the formation of G-quadruplex TBA-conjugated 6-FAM bound with thrombin in a sample. High-energy intermediate, capable of emitting dim light by itself, formed from the reaction between guanines of TBA and TMPG in the presence of TPA, transfers energy to 6-FAM to emit bright light based on the principle of chemiluminescence energy transfer (CRET). G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor devised using the rapid interaction between TBA-conjugated 6-FAM and thrombin quantified trace levels of thrombin without complicated procedures. The limit of detection (LOD\u00bcbackground \u00fe3 \u00c2 standard deviation) of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with good linear calibration curve, accuracy, precision, and recovery was as low as 12.3 nM in 5% human serum. Using the technology reported in this research, we expect that various types of G-quadruplex DNA aptasensors capable of specifically sensing a target molecule such as ATP, HIV, ochratoxin, potassium ions, and thrombin can be developed.",

            "text": "Since 1990 (Ellington and Szostak, 1990; Tuerk and Gold, 1990) , it has been well-known that nucleic acid aptamers selected from a large pool of random sequences, instead of expensive antibodies produced from the sacrifice of small animals, can bind specifically to target molecules in a sample collected from human (Bock et al., 1992; Phan et al., 2005) , food (Cruz-Aguado and Penner, 2008) , and nature (Ueyama et al., 2002) . For example, 15 nt thrombin aptamer (TBA, 5\u2032-GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG-3\u2032) was developed to inhibit thrombin activity capable of converting fibrinogen into clottable fibrin in the hemostasis process (Bock et al., 1992) . Studies with circular dichroism (CD) spectra (Pasternak et al., 2011) , NMR (Kelly et al., 1996) , and X-ray (Kelly et al., 1996; Padmanabhan et al., 1993) were confirmed that the shape of TBA bound with two anion binding recognition exosites of thrombin is G-quadruplex as shown in Fig. 1(a) . G-quadruplex was formed with two square planar structures. The square planar structure called a guanine tetrad was formed through hydrogen bonding between four guanines as shown in Fig. 1(b) . A number of anti-parallel or parallel G-quadruplex aptamers were developed to bind and quantify a wide variety of target molecules such as ATP (Huizenga and Szostak, 1995) , hemin (Travascio et al., 1998) , HIVs (Phan et al., 2005) , insulin (Yoshida et al., 2009) , ochratoxin (Cruz-Aguado and Penner, 2008) , potassium ions (Ueyama et al., 2002) , Sars-CoV helicase (Shum and Tanner, 2008) , and selerostin (Shum et al., 2011) in a sample. Using the characteristics of G-quadruplex DNA aptamers, currently, various types of aptasensors with chemiluminescence (Bi et al., 2010; Freeman et al., 2011; Freeman et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012) , colorimeter (Zhang et al., 2011) , electrochemical (Yuan et al., 2011) , or fluorescence (Yuanboonlim et al., 2012) detection have been developed.",

(2011) observed bright chemiluminescence emitted in the presence of fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated with G-rich single strand DNA. Based on the principle of chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) as shown in Fig. 1(c) , FITC excited by dim chemiluminescence generated from the reaction between G-rich single strand DNA and TMPG emitted bright green light (Yamasuji et al., 2011) . The results indicate that it is possible to develop highly sensitive biosensors with guanine chemiluminescence detection. Fig. 1 indicates that TBA, G-rich single strand DNA, can be transformed to G-quadruplex in the presence of thrombin as well as react with TMPG to emit glow chemiluminescence. Using the combination of two apparently distinctive roles of TBA, it is possible to develop G-quadruplex DNA aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence detection capable of sensing thrombin in a sample. Based on the hypothesis, cost-effective, rapid, and simple G-quadruplex aptasensor with highly sensitive guanine chemiluminescence detection was developed in this study.",

As shown in Fig. 2  (a) , TBA-conjugated 6-FAM as well as TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of GO emit strong and glow chemiluminescent light with the addition of TPA and TMPG. Fig. 2(a) shows that the ratio between relative CL intensity of TBA-conjugated 6-FAM and relative CL intensity of TBA-conjugated 6-FAM immobilized on the surface of GO was dependent on the measuring time of emission. The ratio determined with 100 s measurement was the smallest. The results shown in Fig. 2(a) indicate that G-rich TBAs immobilized on the surface of GO began to slowly react with TMPG. G-rich TBAs reacted with TMPG, which are not DNA aptamers, rapidly detached from GO. Then, they emitted strong CL emission through the chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) from a high-energy intermediate, formed from the reaction between guanine of TBA and TMPG, to 6-FAM (see Fig. S1 ). The possible CRET mechanism in guanine chemiluminescence reaction may be similar to chemically initiated electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL) mechanism of peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence (Lee et al., 2002a (Lee et al., , 2002b Maruyama et al., 2013; Park et al., 2011) .

            "text": "Based on the results shown in Fig.2 , we confirmed that it is difficult to develop a G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence detection using nanoparticles (e.g., GO, magnetic Fe 3 O 4 GO) capable of immobilizing TBA through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction between nanoparticle and TBA. However, Fig. 2 also shows a positive possibility that thrombin can be quantified with only TBA-conjugated 6-FAM without any nanoparticles. This is because (1) TBA-conjugated 6-FAM not bound with thrombin can emit bright light in guanine chemiluminescence system (see Fig. 2 (a)) and (2) G-quadruplex TBA-bound thrombin cannot emit light in guanine chemiluminescence system (see Fig. 2(f) ). These results indicate that relative CL intensity of guanine chemiluminescence in the presence of a certain concentration of TBA-conjugated 6-FAM is dependent on the concentration of thrombin. In other words, relative CL intensity of guanine chemiluminescence is quenched with the increase of thrombin concentration in a sample due to the increase of G-quadruplex TBA-bound thrombin concentration. Based on the hypothesis, G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence capable of sensing thrombin in human serum was developed with additional research as shown below. ",

Relative CL intensity of TBA-conjugated 6-FAM was about 244-fold higher than that of TBA in water. Also, the former was about 229-fold higher than the latter in 10% human serum. Relative CL intensity of TBA-conjugated 6-FAM in water was slightly higher (about 1.16-fold) than that in 10% human serum. In the case of 100% human serum, CL emission of TBA was not observed. Also, relative CL intensity of TBAconjugated 6-FAM in 100% human serum was much lower than those in water and 10% human serum. Table S1 indicates that it is difficult to develop a highly sensitive G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor without diluting human serum because human serum contains interferences capable of reducing guanine chemiluminescence. Table 1 shows that relative CL intensity measured in the presence of thrombin is lower than that in the absence of thrombin. The result is a proof that G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence without any nanoparticles can be developed based on the cost-effective and simple procedures as shown in Fig. 3 . Table 1 also indicates that the quenching ratio of guanine chemiluminescence is dependent on the concentration of human serum in water. The quenching ratio in water was larger than those in human serums diluted with water. The results shown in Table 1 indicate that the interaction between TBAconjugated 6-FAM and thombin in pure in the absence of water human serum is faster than that in the presence of human serum. Based on the results of Table 1 , we have used 5% human serum diluted with water to develop more sensitive G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor for the quantification of thrombin in real samples such as serums collected from patients.",

Fig. 5 (a) shows that relative CL intensity of Gquadruplex TBA aptasensor operated based on the procedure shown in Fig. 3 was exponentially decreased with the increase of thrombin concentration. Relative CL intensity and quenching ratio in 5% human serum were smaller than those in water. Also, the linear dynamic range (0.5-8 mg/ml) in 5% human serum was slightly narrow than that (0.25-8 mg/ml) in water as shown in Fig. 5(b) . This is because 5% human serum contains interferences capable of reducing the sensitivity of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor. Normal range of thrombin in human blood is 50-100 mg/ml (2.5-5 mg/ml in 5% human blood). Thus, we expected that G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor developed in this research can be applied to quantify thrombin in human blood. The limit of detection (LOD\u00bc background\u00fe 3 \u00c2 standard deviation) of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor to quantify thrombin in 5% human serum was 0.4 mg/ml (12.3 nM) . The background of G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor was the reciprocal of relative CL intensity measured in the absence of thrombin. LOD of G-quadruplex.

Based on the concept, we developed a cost-effective, rapid and simple G-quadruplex TBA aptasensor with highly sensitive guanine chemiluminescence detection without expensive and intractable nanoparticles, including magnetic Fe 3 O 4 GO nanoparticles, and complicated procedures. In conclusion, the results observed in this research indicate that various types of G-quadruplex DNA aptasensors capable of specifically sensing a target molecule such as ATP, HIV, ochratoxin, potassium ions, and thrombin can be developed. Thus, G-quadruplex DNA aptasensor with guanine chemiluminescence detection can be applied in various research areas such as bio-analytical chemistry, clinical chemistry, food safety, and toxicology.
