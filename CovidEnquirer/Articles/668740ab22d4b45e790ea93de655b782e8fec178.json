In addition, his laboratory has been at the forefront of bovine cytokine biology, providing a steady stream of important reports on the biological effects of bovine cytokines in vivo and in vitro.He has authored or co-authored more than 275 peer-reviewed journal articles in a wide array of veterinary and biomedical journals, and 41 reviews or book chapters. The excellence of his work has earned funding from both public and industry sources. He also played a prominent role in training researchers in veterinary virology and immunology, having been mentor for more than 35 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and research associates. Several of these have subsequently gone on to achieve succes as independent investigators. The AAVI was pleased to recognize Dr. Babiuk's accomplishments and credentials with this year's Distinguished Veterinary Immunologist Award.",

In support of this objective, the AAVI sponsors a competition for the best oral and poster presentations in immunology at the annual CRWAD meeting. The students' performances are consistently outstanding; this year was no exception. The first place award for an oral presentation was given to John VanCott, of the Ohio State University (mentor Dr. Linda Saif) for his presentation entitled, \"Antibody-secreting cells in mucosal lymphoid tissues of pigs inoculated with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus and challenged with TGEV.\" The second place award was presented to JeffAdams of the University of Wisconsin (mentor Dr. Charles Czuprynski) for his talk entitled, \"Detection of monokine mRNA in bovine monocytes exposed to Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in vitro.\" Two awards were also given for poster presentations. The first place award went to Lori Hutchinson of Iowa State University and the National Animal Disease Center (mentor Dr. David Stevens ) for her poster entitled, \"Cytokine secretion and mRNA expression by mitogen-stimulated bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\" A second place award was earned by Kristen Gustafson, University of Minnesota (mentor Dr. Tom Molitor) for her poster entitled, \"Effect of neuroendocrine hormone norepinephrine on porcine alveolar macrophage function.\"",

The tentative program includes Dr. Lorne Babiuk (VIDO, University of Saskatchewan, Sask., Canada) Dr. Linda Saif (OARDC, The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH) Dr. Steven Levy (Durham, CT) and Dr. Dale Schuster (American Cyanamid Co., Princeton, N J). Co-chairs for the session are Dr. Manuel Campos of SmithKline Beecham Animal Health (Lincoln, NE) and Dr. Charles Czuprynski (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). The minisymposium will be followed by an informal mixer sponsored by the AAVI to which all interested attendees are invited. The Denver meeting (21-25 May 1993) is historic in that 13 guest societies (including AAVI) will be active participants, making it the first comprehensive immunology meeting in North America. As a result, the meeting should be an outstanding learning opportunity for all those with an interest in immunology. In addition, it provides increased visibility with the broader immunology community for some of the fascinating and important research problems being addressed by veterinary immunologists. We hope that many of you will able to attend the Denver meeting and will join us at the minisymposium and the mixer that follows.",

Membership provides the AAVI Newsletter, the opportunity to subscribe to Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology at a reduced rate of$160, and the ability to register for the American Association of Immunologists meetings at member rates (including the Denver meeting in May 1993). Student membership is required for those students who wish to compete for student presentation awards at the Conference of Research Workers in Animal Disease meeting each year. More importantly, membership allows you to contribute towards the organized sponsorship of veterinary immunology as a distinct discipline, a goal not directly represented by any other North American immunology society. Membership forms can be obtained from Dr. Phil Klesius, Secretary-Treasurer, AAVI, USDA, ARS, Fish Dis. and Parasite Res. Lab, P.O. Box 952, Auburn, AL 36831-0952, USA.",

The outstanding hospitality and scientific sessions of that meeting set a high standard that will be difficult to follow. The planning committee for the 4th IVIS in Davis, CA, USA has accepted the challenge and has begun work to continue the high standard set by the Budapest meeting. The planning committee is chaired by Dr. Laurel Gershwin of the University of California, Davis. Other members include Dr. Bennie Osburn (Davis, CA), Dr. Pat Shewen (Guelph, Ontario ), Dr. Joan Lunney (Beltsville, MD), Dr. Gerhardt Schurig (Blacksburg, VA), Dr. Cindy Brunner (Auburn, AL), and Dr. Czuprynski (Madison, WI) . We hope to see many of you at the 4th IVIS in Davis, 16-20 July 1995, Brief information on the meeting follows. If you have any suggestions or questions regarding the meeting, please contact one of the members of the planning committee listed above.",
