A larger, second wave of cases was anticipated the following autumn. To reduce a potential surge of health system utilization without denying needed care, we enlisted the input of experts from medicine, public health, nursing, information technology, and other disciplines to design, test, and deploy clinical algorithms to help minimally trained health care workers and laypeople make informed decisions about care-seeking for influenza-like illness. The product of this collaboration, named Strategy for Off-Site Rapid Triage (SORT) was disseminated in 2 forms. Static algorithms, posted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site, offered guidance to clinicians and telephone call centers on how to manage adults and children with influenza-like illness. In addition, 2 interactive Web sites, http://www.Flu.gov and http://www. H1N1ResponseCenter.com, were created to help adults self-assess their condition and make an informed decision about their need for treatment. Although SORT was anchored in a previously validated clinical decision rule, incorporated the input of expert clinicians, and was subject to small-scale formative evaluations during rapid standup, prospective evaluation is lacking. If its utility and safety are confirmed, SORT may prove to be a useful tool to blunt health system surge and rapidly collect epidemiologic data on future disease outbreaks.",

In each, localized, often mild outbreaks were followed some months later by massive waves of illness and mortality, often in younger age groups. 2 Virulence varied widely; the 1918 to 1920 pandemic (also caused by an H1N1 strain) was by far the worst, killing 20 to 40 million people worldwide. The 1968 to 1970 pandemic was the mildest of the 4. But in each instance, the toll of deaths and illness substantially exceeded that of a typical flu season. 3 Because pandemic monitoring was primarily focused on Asia, public health officials were caught by surprise when a novel strain of H1N1 influenza suddenly emerged in the Western Hemisphere at the end of a regular flu season. Initially, the high number of reported fatalities relative to hospitalized cases in Mexico suggested that the virus was highly lethal. This prompted Mexican health authorities to close schools, cancel public events, and impose other community disease mitigation strategies in hopes of limiting the outbreak's effects.",

This could mean that doctors' offices and hospitals may get filled to capacity.\" 7 The PCAST predicted that 2009 H1N1 could infect 30% to 50% of the population and produce symptoms in 20% to 40%. If even half that number sought medical attention, the pandemic would send 30 to 60 million Americans into an already heavily burdened emergency care system. 8 Early experience appeared to justify the council's concern. Between May 15 and June 15, more than 44,000 people with influenzalike illness had visited New York City emergency departments (EDs) compared with 4,267 the year before. Total ED visits increased by 32%, from 325,135 the previous year to more than 428,000. 9 In some communities, ED use surged by 50% to 100%. 10 Because the second wave of influenza pandemics is typically larger than the first, officials worried at the time that a sustained surge of ED visits could worsen already dangerous waits for emergency care, 11 overload EDs, and promote iatrogenic transmission of influenza from individuals with flu to medically fragile patients nearby.",

The group named the product of their deliberations Strategy for Offsite Rapid Triage, or SORT. Before the meeting, 3 group members (A.P.I., B.D., T.C.B.; see acknowledgements) conducted an adjudicated literature search to identify clinical decision rules that are designed to identify patients who are severely ill with pneumonia or other conditions. Candidate clinical decision rules were presented to the full group. After a period of discussion, all agreed that the United Kingdom's CRB-65 (4 components of the score: Confusion, Respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths per minute, systolic Blood pressure less than 100 millimeters of mercury and age greater than or equal to 65 years) score was best suited to anchor the proposed influenza-like illness algorithm. The CRB-65 score was selected because it uses simple signs and symptoms, does not require diagnostic testing, and accurately quantifies illness severity in patients with pneumonia. 13 The group then developed an efficient, 3-step process to assess patients with influenza-like illness. In the first step, patients are screened to determine whether they meet CDC criteria for influenza-like illness. Those who do proceed to the second step, an assessment of illness severity using questions adopted from the CRB-65 score. Patients with influenza-like illness who have a CRB-65 score of 0 (suggesting relatively mild illness) move on to the third step, a short series of questions designed to determine whether they have a health condition that increases their risk of developing severe complications of influenza.",
