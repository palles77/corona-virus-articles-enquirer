In a forensic setting microbiological information will always be difficult to interpret due to lack of antemortem information and changes in flora postmortem. With this study we aim to review the use of microbiological procedures at our forensic institute. In a retrospective study including 42 autopsies performed at our Institute, where microbiological test had been applied, analyses were made with regard to: type of microbiological tests performed, microorganisms found, histological findings, antemortem information, C-reactive protein measurement and cause of death. Fiftyone different microorganisms were found distributed among 37 cases, bacteria being the most abundant. Nineteen of the cases were classified as having a microbiological related cause of death. Creactive protein levels were raised in 14 cases of the 19 cases, histological findings either supported or were a decisive factor for the classification of microbiologically related cause of death in 14 cases. As a multitude of abundant microorganisms are able to cause infection under the right circumstances, all findings should be compared to anamnestic antemortem information, before conclusions are drawn. A definite list of true pathogens is nearly impossible to compile.",

Agonal spread: According to this theory the ischemia in the agonal period or during resuscitation lead to mucosal damage allowing bacteria to invade through the surface in question. 3. Postmortem translocation: The movement of naturally present bacteria across the mucosal barriers, into the surrounding tissue, bloodstream and body. One should expect a mixed growth and not a single isolate bacteria [13] . 4. Contamination: Microorganisms are introduced into the tissue at time of sampling, and were not present in life. The theory of agonal spread is according to a review by Morris et al., considered unlikely [13] . Several papers find that elapsed time from death to sampling point does not have a significant influence on false positive bacterial results provided that bodies are kept refrigerated [11, [13] [14] [15] . However animal experiments performed by Heimesat et al. [16] do show a rather large increase in bacteria in extra-intestinal tissue especially up to 72 h after death. Perhaps even more interesting, they observe a rise in extraintestinal bacteria already five minutes after death. Maujean et al. report an interesting case in which Neisseria meningitidis was detected in a putrefied body after 10 days using molecular analyses [17] . Pryce et al. compared antemortem vs. postmortem sampling and concluded that postmortem sampling is as valuable as antemortem, when related to an infectious COD [18] . The risk of contamination from the autopsy room seems to be small [19] . Table 3 shows the vast diversity of microorganisms found in our cases, and illustrates the large number of possible pathogens. The majority of bacteria could be considered postmortem translocation, however as many of the microorganisms contributing to our normal flora can become pathogens under the right circumstances, all findings must be carefully considered.",

Several of the above are however part of our natural flora, and may be considered opportunistic pathogens [20] , only causing disease in persons with an underlying illness, immune deficiency, or are perhaps only known to cause disease in children etc. [21] . Generally all cases should be correlated to anamnestic information, if any present, both medical and socio-economic [22] before a microorganism is classified as a true infection. Hence a definite list of true pathogens is impossible to comprise.",

In Denmark around 5% of autopsies do not yield a viable cause of death, and though microbiological testing would be performed on most, the possibility remains that a few of these deaths could be due to infections/sepsis. In this study 13 of 18 cases with a microbiologically related COD had elevated CRP values (p < 0.05). Considering that result and the literature on the subject [6, 23] , one would suggest that CRP measurement is carried out at the beginning of the autopsy. This would give an early indication of a possible infection in cases where antemortem information does not suggest such, allowing for microbiological sampling before significant handling of the body and a hence reduced risk of mechanical contamination, both by direct transfer of bacteria and by displacement of bowel-near blood in arteries and veins.",

Since it is even more sensitive than culturing [8] it might possibly yield an even higher number of positive results.

Investigators should always take into account all findings and anamnestic information in each case compared to the detected microorganisms before making any conclusions.
