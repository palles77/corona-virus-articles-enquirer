Some strains of HEV cause fatal encephalomyelitis characterized by squealing, vomiting, constipation, progressive paralysis and nervous signs in suckling piglets up to one week of age (Mitchell, 1963) . Other strains have been shown to cause vomiting and wasting disease of piglets under 2 weeks of age, i.e. signs of gastrointestinal infection rather than encephalomyelitis (Alexander and Saunders, 1969; Cartwright, Lucas, Cavill, Gush and Blandford, 1969; Kershaw, 1969) . On the other hand, Mengeling, Boothe and Ritchie (1972) have isolated HEV from tonsillar swabs of asymptomatic adult pigs.",

In the early stage, swelling of mitochondria and increase in endoplasmic reticulum were associated with accumulation of free ribosomes. Particles, presumably virions, approximately 90 nm in diameter, appeared individually or in short rows in the space between membranes of endoplasmic reticulum in some areas (Fig. 4) . Similar particles were visible within electron-dense areas enclosed by a membrane or a double membrane (Fig. 5) . In the next stage, the particles became more numerous. Amorphous tubular structures and a large number of vesicles containing virions were observed in the cytoplasmic space of the nerve cells (Fig. 6) . The developmental process of individual particles appeared to be that of budding from intracytoplasmic membranes (Figs 7 to 9 ). In the late stage, vesicular or cellular walls were broken and the particles were frequently noted in the extracellular space. The mature particles had club-shaped projections and were 100 to 130 nm in diameter. DISCUSSION Several coronaviruses have been shown to grow in suckling mouse brain (Simpson and Group& 1959; McIntosh et al., 1967; Bhatt et al., 1972; Weiner, 1973; Horzinek et al., 1978) , but HEV has not. HEV replicates only in porcine kidney cell cultures, because of its fastidious growth requirements. Appel et al. (1965) have reported that suckling mice inoculated orally with HEV-I strain developed no clinical signs and that virus was not re-isolated from oral swabs.",

In the present study, mice inoculated with the MB-67N strain by the i.c. route were shown to succumb without age difference, although a smaller dose of virus was fatal for suckling mice only. Adults did not die after i.n., i.p. or S.C. inoculation, even with a large dose of the MB-67N strain. Death occurred in suckling mice under 16 days old by i.n., i.p. and S.C. inoculation. These findings indicate that the susceptibility of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes, and appears to resemble that of HEV infection in pigs.",

They stated that nasal mucosa, tonsil, lung and small intestine served as primary sites of replication and the virus then progressed via peripheral nerves to the CNS. The trigeminal nerve, vagal nerve and intestinal plexuses were also proposed as pathways to the CNS (Andries and Pensaert, 1981) . Our findings in mice support their concepts in pigs. Furthermore, the olfactory nerve may also serve as one of the pathways to the CNS in i.n. inoculated mice. The relation between age-dependent susceptibility and maturation of the nervous system, regarded as the pathway of viral spread, will be an interesting subject for future research.",

These findings revealed the characteristic lesions consisting of necrosis in almost all areas of the brain inoculated by the i.c. route. Similar necrosis of the brain was observed after i.n. inoculation, but the reaction was slightly milder in i.p. and S.C. routes. McIntosh et al. (1967) reported that the predominant histological finding in mouse brain affected with human coronavirus (HCV) was round cell infiltration of the meninges and perivascular spaces of the cerebral cortex. In mice inoculated with sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) of rats, diffuse and focal neuronal degeneration with minimal inflammatory cell response were found by Bhatt et al. (1972) .

            "text": "The morphogenesis of the virions in the infected brain was essentially in accord with that in PK cell culture (Mengeling et al., 1972) . In addition, the amorphous tubular structures found in infected cells with HCV (McIntosh et al., 1967; Oshiro, Scieble and Lennette, 1971 ) and MHV (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965) were also observed in this study. The relationship of these structures to the developmental process of virus particles has not been elucidated. The findings by immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy revealed the localization of large numbers of virus particles in the nerve cells. Thus, the nerve cell is considered to serve as a main target of virus replication. In this study, fatal infection of suckling mice caused by HEV was shown and a few similarities between infections of mice and pigs were also represented. Mice infected with the MB-67N strain will be utilized as an experimental model for HEV infection in pigs. SUMMARY Three-day-old suckling mice inoculated intracerebrally ( 1i.c.) with the 67N strain of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HE\\ ') showed nervous signs and died. The virus was passaged 10 times in suck1 ing mice and was designated the MB-67N strain. The pathogenesis of MB-67N was studied with various ages of mice and inoculation routes. All mice inoculated i.c. with a large dose of virus died regardless of age, although a smaller dose caused fatal infection only in suckling mice. By intranasal, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous inoculation, the virus also killed suckling mice under 16 days old, but not older mice, even with a large dose. The susceptibilily of mice for the MB-67N strain was influenced by age and inoculation routes. High titres of virus were re-isolated from the brain of diseased mice after inoculation by any route, but not from other organs. Histologically, numerous areas of severe focal necrosis were produced in the cerebral cortex. Specific immuno-fluorescence and numerous viral particles were found in the cytoplasm of nerve cells by immuno-fluorescence staining and electron microscopy. These findings indicate that the MB-67N propagates mainly in the central nervous system and nerve cells serve as a main target of virus replication.",
