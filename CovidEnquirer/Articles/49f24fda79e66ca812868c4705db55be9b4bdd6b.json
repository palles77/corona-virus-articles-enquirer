Antibodies that specifically recognize the SARS-CoV spike and nucleocapsid proteins may provide a rapid screening method to allow accurate identification and isolation of patients with the virus early in their infection. For this reason, we raised peptide-induced polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV spike protein and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein using 6\u00c2 His nucleocapsid recombinant protein. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining showed that these antibodies specifically recognized SARS-CoV.",

Phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons show that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses, with only an approximate 25-30% identity with other members of the coronavirus family [2] [3] [4] . Therefore, it was postulated that SARS-CoV is an animal virus that was only recently transmitted to humans. Examination of domestic and wild mammals in Guangdong Province, southern China, suggested that the Himalayan palm civet and raccoon dog might have been in the route of interspecies transmission [6] . In addition, ferrets and domestic cats are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV and they may efficiently transmit the virus to previously uninfected animals that are housed with them [7] , indicating that the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV involves a range of animal species.",

Human aminopeptidase N (CD13, hAPN) has been demonstrated to be a receptor for this virus [9] . Studies on the interaction between HcoV-229E spike protein and hAPN show that the domain of the spike protein between amino acids 417 and 547 is essential for the binding of HcoV-229E to its hAPN receptor. Furthermore, soluble hAPN neutralized the infectivity of HcoV-229E virions at 37\u00b0C [10, 11] . The SARS-CoV spike gene encodes a glycoprotein of approximate 150 kDa containing 1255 amino acids. More recently, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified to be a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus [12] . The spike protein may mediate membrane fusion and induce neutralizing antibodies in the host, raising the possibility that antibodies against the SARS-CoV spike protein may be good tools for early detection and neutralization of SARS-CoV infection.",

BCV spike protein consists of two subunits, N-terminal S1 (110 kDa) and C-terminal S2 (100 kDa). S1, which forms the bulb portion of the spike, contains domains responsible for viral attachment to the receptor of host cells, while S2, anchoring the spike into the envelope, possesses regions essential for fusion between the virus and cell membrane during infection [19] . Structural analysis predicts that peptides (ISGINAS VVNIQKEIDRLNEVAKNLNESLIDLQEL) derived from the SARS-CoV S2 protein might inhibit virus-induced membrane fusion, thereby blocking SARS-CoV infection [20] . Coincidentally, our SP6 (DVDLGDISGIN ASVVNIQKEIDR, a.a. 1145-1167) partially covers the above peptide. Peptide SP6-induced polyclonal antibody was adequate for Western blot analysis but did not render a good result for immunofluorescence assay.

For instance, the nucleocapsid proteins of coronaviruses IBV (group III) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, group I) have only 29% identity with that of bovine coronavirus (BcoV, group II). Within the group II coronaviruses, the N proteins of MHV and BcoV have 70% identity [23] . The subcellular localizations of infectious avian bronchitis virus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nucleocapsid protein in both cytoplasm and nucleolus have been described [24, 25] . The nucleolus is a structure within the nucleus that is only present during interphase. It is the site where rRNA is synthesized and processed. Biogenesis of pre-ribosomal subunits and polymerase III transcripts also takes place in the nucleolus [26] . One possible explanation for the entry of nucleocapsid protein into the nucleolus is that coronaviruses need to control host ribosomes to produce thousands of viral RNA copies. Over-expression of coronavirus nucleocapsid protein appeared to induce a cell cycle arrest, most likely in the G2/M phase [24] , indicating that nucleocapsid protein may interact with unknown cytoplasmic and nucleolar proteins and delay the cell cycle progression. Interestingly, however, our study shows that SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells, and nucleocapsid-transfected 293T and Vero cells, but not in the nucleolus. This suggests that SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein may interact with cytoplasmic proteins rather than nucleolar proteins to localize at certain organelles in the cytoplasm. It is possible, then, that the biological function of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein is totally different from those in other coronaviruses. This unusual localization and behavior of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein may have contributed in some way to the severity of the recent outbreak of SARS.",
