Infection with MERS-CoV results in higher mortality and new symptoms such as renal failure.

Moreover, the S2 m motif in its 3\u02b9UTRs and the phylogenetic analyses of four fully characterized genomes of SARS-like CoV indicated that the horseshoe bats have great potential to be one of the natural reservoirs. 2, 3 Given that, the same research suggested that, even though there are no available migration patterns, it is known that bats can migrate approximately 30 miles for hibernation, and the distance between their wild habitats and markets in Shenzheng and Hong Kong is only 17 miles, which means that geographically widespread infections of SARS-like CoV can be explained by transmission via bats.",

The study compared the nonstructural protein genes ORF1a and 1b of the virus and concluded that SARSr-CoV strains from a cave in Yunnan village were more closely related to human SARS-CoV and cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor. 4 Just as horseshoe bats were postulated to be the primary SARS host, van Boheeman et al. 5 indicated that two kinds of bats carry similar MERS coronaviruses. Then, Susanna K. P. Lau et al. 6 used sequences of RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes to determine that human MERS-CoV RdRp is more closely related to the pipistrelle bat CoV HKU5 (92.1%-92.3% amino acid identity) and the S and N genes are more closely related to the Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (respectively, 66.8%-67.4% and 71.9%-72.3% amino acid identity), indicating that these three viruses may share the same ancestor.

Those seeds may carry bat feces and then drop to ground, where they might be eaten by camels. If MERS-CoV is found in cereal plantations near where bats congregate, this view will be confirmed.",

MERS-CoV can also survive longer in camel milk than in other ruminant milk. In addition to the above two routes, MERS-CoV RNA can be detected in 59% of nasal discharge and 15% of feces in camels. Thus, there is supportive evidence for the three postulated transmission routes, but further verification is needed to confirm them.

Determining the evolutionary pathway leading to the ability to transfer between species may be helpful in predicting the next epidemic outbreak. Regarding models for MERS-CoV, camels do not develop the same clinical signs as humans, although they are natural hosts. In addition, they require too much space to house and thus are not the first choice for a laboratory model. Rabbits can be infected by MERS-CoV, but the histology is unstable, which would limit routine observation of disease. Compared to those animal models, other than DPP4 transgenic mice, rhesus macaques and marmosets are currently the best MERS animal models. Since their immune system is like that of humans in terms of physiology and anatomy, they can be used to study the pathogenesis mechanism and the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals. However, research using rhesus macaques requires BSL-3 laboratories and high investments. Moreover, they are smart, fast, and strong, which means precautions must be taken against them escaping. Therefore, the need for more user-friendly models still exists, but to date non-human primate models are still the best option.",

However, gross lesions were only visible in the lungs. Microscopically, these were typical bronchointerstitial pneumonia or interstitial pneumonia. Another experiment 26 used an intravascularly inoculated infection dose of 6.5 9 10 7 TCID 50 , which resulted in pulmonary congestion and the microscopic lesions of interstitial pneumonia. After infection, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples and partially in oropharyngeal swabs. Inside the body, it was present only in the lungs, and not in blood or any visceral organs, even the kidneys. 3,24,27 Additionally, all blood count abnormalities in the rhesus macaques were like those reported in human cases. In contrast to the results found for MERS-CoV, rhesus macaques developed different symptoms after being challenged with different SARS-CoV lineages.

Moreover, even though they were in close contact with the young goats, the adult goats did not become infected. Thus, the infection of goats is unstable and related to age. In contrast to the experiment with goats, sheep did not show immunohistochemically detectable infection. Three sheep were infected, and one of them displayed viral replication on days 1, 2, 3 and 5 in their nasal secretions, while another one displayed viral replication on day 6.

In the experiment, the captive civets become apathetic and less aggressive, which was different from the results found in wild civets. The histochemistry results were similar Wild animal reservoirs Considering all the evidence, bats have great potential to be the common prime host for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Bat CoVs go through a long adaptation in civet cats and/or camels until the exact mutated lineage develops that allows a coronavirus to achieve interspecies transmission and start an outbreak. However, based on research to date, even if further evidence were provided, we still do not know why bats in the Yunnan province are the most likely reservoir, but the epidemics broke out over 1000 miles away. How exactly does the long adaptation process of the SARS-CoV finish and what is the epidemic singularity? A transmission experiment between bats and civets should be done to fill this gap in our knowledge. As the most important agent in the MERS epidemic, camels were acknowledged be linked to MERS-CoV transmission through all morbidity and serum assays. Though the mechanisms of interspecies transmission are not yet determined, there are still some clues. Besides, in areas where camels graze or where camel shows and races occur the risk of transmission can increase. The investigations into camels suggested that civets may spread SARS-CoV via meat, feces and even aerosols, as well as via mechanisms that are common to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Key factors regarding transmission, such as contact with bats in their environment and large numbers of animals being traded over long distances, may apply to both civets and camels. At the same time, humans desire contact with wild animals and want to tame them. Thus, despite natural mechanisms keeping humans and wild animals apart, there is a constant link between them. Before coronavirus outbreaks occur in humans, part of a known coronavirus may go through a long evolutionary pathway in unknown hosts. Regarding their morphological structure, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are both novel coronaviruses with striking similarities.",
