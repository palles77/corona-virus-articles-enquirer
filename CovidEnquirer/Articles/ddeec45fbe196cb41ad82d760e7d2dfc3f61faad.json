By analyzing the genomewide data of mRNA stability published by someone previously, we found that human intron-containing genes have more stable mRNAs than intronless genes, and the Arabidopsis thaliana genes with the most unstable mRNAs have fewer introns than other genes in the genome. After controlling for mRNA length, we found mRNA stability is still positively correlated with intron number in human intron-containing genes. But in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two different datasets on mRNA half-life gave conflicting results. The components of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles recruited during intron splicing may be retained in cytoplasmic mRNPs and act as signals of mRNA stability or simply insulators to avoid mRNA degradation.",

Recent progress has revealed that splicing out introns from pre-mRNAs can enhance almost every steps of gene expression from transcription to translation [4] . As mRNA accumulation is determined by both synthesis and degradation, mRNA stability is equally important in regulating gene expression as transcription [5, 6] . Do introns also increase the amount of protein produced from a gene by enhancing the mRNA stability?",

In maize, inclusion of salT intron can stimulate cat gene expression to 10-18-fold higher than the intronless control gene; but the spliced mRNAs do not have a higher stability than those encoded by the intronless control gene [8] . Nott et al. [9] found that human TPI intron 6 inserted into reporter gene Renilla luciferase can enhance the mRNA accumulation, but they did not observe any significant splicing-dependent alteration in mRNA stability. Chang et al. [10] found that insertion of a 138-bp intron into SARS-CoV spike protein gene can enhance the protein expression in mammalian cells, but the mRNAs exhibited similar decay rates as the intronless control mRNA. Splicing was found to be essential for significant protein expression of human b-globin gene. Absence of introns results in inefficient 3 0 -end mRNA processing, and the unprocessed b-globin mRNA is substantially less stable than the 3 0end processed mRNA [11] . In addition, the half-life of 3 0 -end processed b-globin mRNAs encoded by intron-containing gene was 21 \u00b1 7 h while the half-life of the 3 0 -end processed b-globin mRNAs encoded by intronless gene was 15 \u00b1 3 h [11] . But the authors [11] and another scientist that cited the paper [12] looked it as a minor difference, and so they did not think that introns can alter mRNA stability.",

A successful example is the survey of genes with one or more 3 0 -untranslated exons to test the rule for termination-codon position in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [13] . For the present issue, the relationship between mRNA stability and intron presence was not extensively studied in genome scale. Gutierrez et al. [14] compared 100 genes with the most unstable transcripts against genes encoding stable transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana. They did not find significant differences in intron numbers. Although most of the genes are intronless in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, more than 70% of ribosome protein genes have at least one intron [15] . Five ribosome protein genes were found to encode anomalous unstable mRNAs (half-life < 10 min). Wang et al. [15] noticed that four of the five genes lack introns. The aberrantly decay rates of these genes were attributed to specialized regulatory programs and distinct functions [15] .",

In human T lymphocytes stimulated with medium and T lymphocytes stimulated with antibodies anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes have longer half-lives than those of intronless genes (Table 1 ). In human T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody, there is also a significant difference between mRNA half-lives of intron-containing genes and those of intronless genes (P = 0.045). Considered from the average value of mRNA half-lives, the mRNAs of intronless genes are a little more stable than those of the intron-containing genes. But if considered from the median value of mRNA half-lives, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable than those of the intronless genes. As the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test uses the ranks of the data rather than their raw values to calculate the statistic, the conclusion based on median value is stronger. That is, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes have longer half-lives than those of intronless genes in human T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody. As a stable mRNA can be measured by lower decay rate or longer half-life, our analyses of different sources of data consistently showed that the mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable than those of intronless genes in human cells.",

According to the observed mRNA decay rates, Yang and coauthors [16] divided the Gene Ontology (GO) categories into three groups: faster, slower, and no significant. We analyzed the distribution of intron-containing genes and intronless genes in the three GO groups by chi-square test.

More stringent criteria result in much fewer pairs of genes giving too small a sample to study. In the cases that two or more intron-containing genes are paired with one intronless gene, we used the median value of the mRNA stabilities of the intron-containing genes in the pairwise comparison with the intronless gene. We found that the mRNAs of intronless genes are less stable (i.e. have higher decay rates or shorter half-lives) than the intron-containing genes with similar mRNA lengths and functions (Fig. 1) .

            "text": "Then, how can introns enhance the mRNA stability? The components of mRNPs (messenger ribonucleoprotein particles) recruited during intron splicing or deposited onto exon-exon junctions [25, 26] may be retained in cytoplasmic mRNPs and act as signals of mRNA stability, or simply insulators to avoid inter-or intra-RNA base-pairing. Some proteins have been shown to have such insulating effects to prevent RNA:DNA hybrid (i.e. R loop structure) in nucleus, thereby suppressing unwanted DNA recombination [27] [28] [29] [30] . Similarly, a gene having high intron density is expected to have better insulated mRNAs in cytoplasm. The mRNAs of a human gene without introns or with few introns are more likely to form stem-loop which will stall ribosome and trigger endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage [31, 32] . Meanwhile these mRNAs are also more likely to form double-stranded RNA with other RNAs in cytoplasm, being prone to degraded by RNA interference [33] . In addition, there is also evidence that the exon junc-tion complexes of mRNPs promotes mRNA ribosome association [34] . The ribosomes attached on mRNA may have the effect of stabilizing mRNA in a way similar with the protein components of mRNPs. ",
