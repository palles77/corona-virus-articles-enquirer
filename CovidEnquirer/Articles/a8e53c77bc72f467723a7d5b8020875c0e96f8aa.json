Very recently report had suggested that novel CoV would use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as the SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a novel recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV.",

And the TNF receptor fusion protein has been use in clinic for decades 17 . Unlike the blood resident enzymes of coagulation factors, full-length endogenous ACE2 is a transmembrane protein anchored to the cell surface and that ACE2 activities are, in fact, present at very low levels in systemic circulation [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, one safety concern of the ACE2 fusion protein is that they may have systemic cardiovascular side-effect.

Our data shows that Both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV viruses were potently neutralized by ACE2-Ig and mACE2-Ig. The IC50 of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV viruses neutralized by ACE2-Ig were 0.8 and 0.1 \u03bc g/ml, respectively. And The IC50 of the two viruses neutralized by mACE2-Ig were 0.9 and 0.08 \u03bc g/ml, respectively (Fig. 2). No evidence of neutralization was observed for the TIGIT-Ig. We next using cell fusion assay to further characterize the in vitro neutralization effect of the fusion proteins (Fig .3). ACE2-Ig potently inhibited the SARS CoV-S protein-mediated fusion with an IC50 of 0.85 \u03bc g/ml, and the 2019 nCoV-S protein-mediated fusion with an IC50 of 0.65 \u03bc g/ml. Under the same experimental conditions, another fusion protein mACE2-Ig exhibited an IC50 of 0.76 \u03bc g/ml and 0.48\u03bcg/ml, for the SARS CoV and 2019 nCoV, respectively. The control TIGIT-Fc did not show any inhibitory effect in this assay. These data suggest that both ACE2-Ig and mACE2-Ig exhibit potent inhibitory activity against SARS CoV and 2019 nCOV.ACE2 has already been identified as an important drug targets for the treatment of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Although it has been established that ACE2 is a key function receptor for the coronavirus infection, the practical use of rACE2 protein may be impede by the short half-life of rACE2.
