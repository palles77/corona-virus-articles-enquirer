Through overland runoff and tile drainage, zoonotic pathogens can contaminate surface water and streambed sediment and could affect both wildlife and human health. This study examined the environmental occurrence of gene markers for livestock-related bacterial, protozoan, and viral pathogens and antibiotic resistance in surface waters within the South Fork Iowa River basin before and after periods of swine manure application on agricultural land. Increased concentrations of indicator bacteria after manure application exceeding Iowa's state bacteria water quality standards suggest that swine manure contributes to diminished water quality and may pose a risk to human health. Additionally, the occurrence of HEV and numerous bacterial pathogen genes for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus in both manure samples and in corresponding surface water following periods of manure application suggests a potential role for swine in the spreading of zoonotic pathogens to the surrounding environment. During this study, several zoonotic pathogens were detected including Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, pathogenic enterococci, and S. aureus; all of which can pose mild to serious health risks to swine, humans, and other wildlife. This research provides the foundational understanding required for future assessment of the risk to environmental health from livestock-related zoonotic pathogen exposures in this j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / s c i t o t e n v region. This information could also be important for maintaining swine herd biosecurity and protecting the health of wildlife near swine facilities.",

Animal manure harbors not only animal-specific pathogens (e.g. bovine viral diarrhea virus), but also zoonotic pathogens (e.g. hepatitis E virus, Campylobacter jejuni) capable of infecting humans (Gordoncillo et al., 2013; Haack et al., 2015; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2013; Ziemer et al., 2010) . Many of these pathogens are able to survive, persist, and move through the agricultural landscape. Agricultural runoff whether via overland flow (Davies et al., 2004) or through the outflow of tile-drain systems (Jamieson et al., 2002; Joy et al., 1998; Wilkes et al., 2014) facilitates pathogen transport and can consequently contaminate and significantly impair the water quality of adjacent surface waters (Crane et al., 1983; Meinhardt et al., 1996) . Pathogens may not only be transported via stream water, but also subsequently may be adsorbed into streambed sediment and later resuspended when the sediment becomes disturbed with animal movement or increased flow via storm events (Goss and Richards, 2008) .",

            "text": "Surface waters and bed sediment can be reservoirs of pathogens that affect both wildlife and human health. In an animal agriculturedominated region in south Alberta, Canada, researchers found a higher prevalence of zoonotic pathogens in surface waters used for drinking, irrigation, and recreational purposes and also a higher incidence of gastrointestinal illness linked to Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella than in neighboring non-agricultural regions, suggesting a link between animal agriculture, contaminated surface waters, and human health (Jokinen et al., 2012) . Current swine manure management practices utilize injection or tillage to incorporate manure to potentially reduce risks of nutrients or pathogens being directly transported to surface water in runoff after rainfall (Dell et al., 2011; Sterk et al., 2013) . Still, this case study along with similar research suggests that both animal and human health are potentially at risk from ongoing manure management practices and subsequent surface water contamination (Gordoncillo et al., 2013; Haack et al., 2016; Haack et al., 2015; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2013; Ziemer et al., 2010) . For example, genes indicative of potentially zoonotic Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and the Enterococcus esp. gene, which is more frequently expressed in isolates from human patients with bacteremia and urinary tract infections (Shankar et al., 1999) , were found in surface waters and sediment up to 25 days after a swine manure spill (Haack et al., 2015) .",

Human HEV infections can be serious with a 1% mortality rate and increased mortality rate of 27% among pregnant women (Chau et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2004) . Several HEV outbreaks in developing countries have been linked to waste-contaminated drinking water (Krawczynski, 1993; Satou and Nishiura, 2007) or contaminated food sources (Satou and Nishiura, 2007) . Such infections, however, are rare in developed countries (Christou and Kosmidou, 2013; Kase et al., 2009 ). Among the four HEV genotypes, only genotype 3 has been reported in the United States and has been found in swine and other domestic animals and also in wild rodents, deer, and wild boar (Christou and Kosmidou, 2013; Satou and Nishiura, 2007; Takahashi et al., 2004; Tei et al., 2003; Yugo and Meng, 2013) .",

A previous swine study from Iowa documented HEV genotype 3 in approximately 68% of storage pits and 38% of waste lagoons (Kasorndorkbua et al., 2005) . This particular genotype is linked to human HEV infections in developed countries (Christou and Kosmidou, 2013; Meng, 2003) and is of particular concern because researchers have found almost genetically indistinguishable swine and human strains of HEV (Kase et al., 2009; Meng et al., 1997) . A study examining the prevalence of HEV among midwestern United States swine herds noted that there was sequence homology between swine HEV and clinical isolates from human HEV cases (Meng et al., 1997) suggesting a potential role for swine in human transmission of this virus. In addition, cross-species infection (e.g. swine to human, deer to human, swine to monkey) indicates that animal strains of HEV not only pose a zoonotic risk to humans but also a health risk to other wildlife (Christou and Kosmidou, 2013; Meng et al., 1998; Meng et al., 1997; Yugo and Meng, 2013) .",

Kasorndorkbua et al. (2005) did not detect HEV in 28 surface water samples taken near swine farms during late summer and autumn. The objective of this study was to determine the presence of HEV and other livestock-related bacterial, protozoan, and viral pathogens (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) in relation to periods of swine manure application in a basin (South Fork Iowa River) with extensive swine production (around 840,000 hogs). This research will provide the foundational understanding required for any future assessment of the risk to environmental health from HEV and other animal agricultural-related pathogen exposures in this region. Such risk could include spread from swine to human, spread from swine to other wildlife (e.g. deer and rodents), or spread among swine farms. This information could be important for maintaining swine herd biosecurity and protecting the health of wildlife near swine facilities.",

The sampling network included five stream sites located in Beaver Creek, Tipton Creek, and the South Fork Iowa River within the South Fork Iowa River basin and one out-of-basin control site in the Walnut Creek basin where no swine were raised. The South Fork Iowa River basin was selected because: (1) it is an area of intense swine production (roughly 840,000 hogs in the 78,000 ha watershed), (2) about 85% of the basin is in row-crop agriculture and 30 to 60% of the basin receives 93 to 186 m 3 ha \u22121 of swine manure annually, (3) the basin has an extensive network of subsurface drainage (tiles) to artificially enhance water drainage providing a rapid transport mechanism for contaminants from the land surface to corresponding streams, and (4) a network of streamflow gages were available throughout the basin to provide important ancillary data on streamflow (Tomer et al., 2008) . The sampling network in the South Fork Iowa River basin consisted of three tributary and two mainstem sampling sites (Fig. 1) . Walnut Creek near Ames, Iowa, was selected as a nearby (within 80 km) out-of-basin control as this basin has similar soils and land use (e.g. tile-drained row crops) but no livestock production and no known swine manure application (Tomer et al., 2003) . Water-quality field measurements were made by use of standard USGS methods (Gibs et al., 2007) (Table 1) . Daily mean streamflow was calculated at the sampling sites over the course of the study using methodology described by Tomer et al. (2008) . Hydrographs were created for the sampling sites for the date of sampling and seven preceding days (Supplemental Fig. 1 ).",

Sampling dates were chosen to capture the first precipitation event causing a rise in the hydrograph after a majority of the manure had been applied to the basin. Water samples were collected from the control site at Walnut Creek on August 10, 2011, and March 8, 2012. Samples were not collected at Walnut Creek for the November 2011 sampling because of a dry streambed or for the April 2012 sampling due to sampling logistics. Water grab samples (n = 22) for enrichment PCR analyses for 19 bacterial antibiotic resistance and pathogen gene markers (bacterial gene markers, BGMs) were collected from the centroid of flow. Water samples (n = 22) for qPCR analyses for HEV and other bacterial, protozoan, and viral targets were collected using a portable pumping system connected to a glass wool filtration with a pre-filter for concentration of bacteria and viruses (Lambertini et al., 2008; Millen et al., 2012) . The mean sample volume filtered was 337 L and ranged from 201 to 837 L. A negative control of the glass wool filtration equipment consisted of sterile phosphate buffered saline (1 \u00d7 PBS) and was performed in the field during every sampling period (four total) and all were negative for all qPCR targets. Bed sediment samples were collected at the same location as the water samples during each sampling period and consisted of the top 2-3 cm of bed material composted from multiple points in the depositional zones (i.e. areas where the bed consisted of finer grained materials). Bed sediment samples were analyzed for indicator bacteria and presence of bacterial pathogen genes. Additionally, hog slurry (manure) samples (n = 2; 1-L in sterile amber glass) were collected from two swine producers in South Fork basin during active 2011 fall manure application. While all sites were visited, fecal samples from wild deer (n = 3) were only found near three sampling sites in March 2012. Deer feces were collected in the riparian zone of the stream adjacent to water sampling locations. Fecal droppings were composited by sampling site in a 1-L sterile amber glass jar and homogenized, and then sub-sampled into three sterile specimen cups. All samples were placed on ice immediately and shipped overnight to Michigan Bacteriological Research Laboratory (MI-BaRL; USGS Michigan Water Science Center, Lansing, MI) for enumeration and enrichment PCR analysis and to the Agricultural Research Service (Marshfield, WI) for qPCR analysis.",

However, HEV was detected more frequently in the current study suggesting a higher incidence of the virus in swine farms in this region. There are several other factors that may have contributed to the increased detection of HEV in the South Fork Iowa River basin including 1) differences in manure management, 2) the intensity of hog production with 30 to 60% of the basin receiving manure, and 3) that the basin is extensively tile drained facilitating rapid transport of these pathogens to streams.

The current study supports this finding by detecting the STII BGM once in the sediment post-manure application, but not in a similar broad distribution that was found after a swine manure spill (Haack et al., 2015) .",

This finding is consistent with the hydrology of the South Fork Iowa River which is dominated by subsurface drainage that artificially enhances the transport of water to corresponding streams. Approximately 90% of baseflow in this basin is from subsurface drainage (Green et al., 2006) . Overland flow after storm events is also a potential transport pathway and both surface and subsurface flow contribute to the transport of E. coli and Enterococcus (Tomer et al., 2010) . Thus, it is likely that both subsurface drainage and overland flow contributed to the transport of HEV and other manure-related constituents to adjacent surface water.",

The spread of HEV and other zoonotic pathogens in the environment is of concern to both animal and human health. Manure management is linked to pathogen load and indirectly influences pathogen survival and transport through the environment (Goss and Richards, 2008) . Application of fresh manure containing bacterial and viral pathogens to fertilize agricultural land can potentially impair groundwater, surface water quality and consequently influence environmental and human health. Further research is needed to: 1) better understand the persistence and survival of manure-related zoonotic pathogens in water and sediment, 2) assess the risk to animals and humans from manure-related zoonotic pathogens, and 3) ascertain manure management techniques that can reduce zoonotic pathogen load to the environment.",
