Host cell factors required for spread of ebolaviruses may serve as targets for antiviral intervention. Lectins, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, Mer), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) proteins, integrins, and Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) have been reported to promote entry of ebolaviruses into certain cellular systems. However, the factors used by ebolaviruses to invade macrophages, major viral targets, are poorly defined. Here, we show that mannose-specific lectins, TIM-1 and Axl augment entry into certain cell lines but do not contribute to Ebola virus (EBOV)-glycoprotein (GP)-driven transduction of macrophages. In contrast, expression of Mer, integrin \u03b1V, and NPC1 was required for efficient GP-mediated transduction and EBOV infection of macrophages. These results define cellular factors hijacked by EBOV for entry into macrophages and, considering that Mer and integrin \u03b1V promote phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, support the concept that EBOV relies on apoptotic mimicry to invade target cells.",

Ebola virus disease (EVD) is endemic in sub-Saharan and Western Africa, with the largest ever recorded EVD outbreak currently unfolding in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia [2] . The import of ebolaviruses into Europe and the United States via infected travelers or infected nonhuman primates highlight the fact that EVD constitutes a global health threat [1, 3, 4] . However, neither approved vaccines nor therapeutics are currently available to combat EVD. Host cell factors exploited by ebolaviruses for viral amplification constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention, and a blockade of the factors required for the first step in viral replication, entry into target cells, might be particularly attractive.",

The GP1 subunit contains an Nterminal receptor-binding domain [5] and interacts with host cell factors, and the GP2 subunit drives fusion of the viral membrane with the membrane of host cell endosomes. Cellular entry of ebolaviruses is thought to commence upon viral binding to incompletely defined factors expressed at the host cell surface, followed by uptake of virions and processing of GP by endosomal cysteine proteases [6] . Processed GP1 then interacts via its receptor-binding domain with the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) [7, 8] . Finally, an incompletely characterized additional stimulus activates GP2 for membrane fusion [9] , resulting in delivery of the viral nucleocapsid into the host cell cytoplasm.",

In addition, certain integrins were found to promote GP-mediated entry, and evidence of GP binding to these factors has been obtained [13] . Furthermore, TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) were shown to promote GP-mediated entry [14] , possibly by stimulating viral uptake via macropinocytosis [15] . Direct interactions between TAM receptors and GP have not been detected, to our knowledge. Two members of the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM) protein family, TIM-1 and TIM-4, were also shown to promote viral entry, and binding of GP to TIM-1 has been demonstrated [16] . However, binding to GP might not account for TIM-1-mediated augmentation of GP-driven entry. Thus, TIM proteins directly [17] and TAM receptors indirectly [18] bind to phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on apoptotic cells, and binding to PtdSer on the virion surface was shown to be important for augmentation of GPdriven entry [15, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Finally, NPC1 has been identified as an endosomal binding partner for GP [7] [8] [9] , as outlined above. However, many of the above-mentioned studies focused on the analysis of cell lines, whereas the cellular factors required for entry of ebolaviruses into macrophages, the major viral target cells, are poorly defined and were thus in the focus of the present study.",

The EBOV-GP1 subunit was also able to bind to DC-SIGN, in keeping with published results [10, 11, 33] , but binding to the other proteins tested was within the background range, at least under the conditions used ( Figure 2B ). Thus, augmentation of GP-driven host cell entry by lectins but not by TIM-1 and Axl might rely on efficient binding to the GP1 subunit, in keeping with the concept that the latter factors augment EBOV-GP-driven entry by binding to PtdSer in the viral envelope [20, 23] .",

Therefore, we asked whether EBOV-GP might exploit other cellular factors with a comparable activity for macrophage entry. We focused our analysis on integrin \u03b1V, CD14, CD36, LOX-1, SR-A, and Mer, all known to be expressed in macrophages and to play a role in the detection of apoptotic cells [38] . Moreover, integrin \u03b1V and Mer were previously implicated in EBOV-GP-mediated entry [13, 14] . Transfection of siRNAs directed against integrin \u03b1V, SR-A, and Mer expression significantly reduced EBOV-GP-but not VSV-G-mediated transduction of MDMs ( Figure 6A, left) . Moreover, a combination of siRNAs against Mer, SR-A and NPC1 reduced transduction more efficiently than the single siRNAs ( Figure 6A, right) , suggesting that Mer, SR-A, NPC1, and integrin \u03b1V might all be required for robust EBOV-GPmediated transduction of macrophages.",

We analyzed the effects of siRNA transfection on Mer expression using THP-1 cell-derived macrophages, because Mer protein was readily detected on these cells but not on MDMs, owing to high background signals measured for the latter. Mer expression was modestly reduced upon transfection of Mer-specific but not NPC1-or SR-A-specific siRNA ( Figure 6B) . Similarly, expression of SR-A in MDMs was reduced by siRNA specific for SR-A but not NPC1. Transfection of siRNA directed against Mer had a slight but reproducible effect on SR-A expression ( Figure 6B ), suggesting that full expression of SR-A might ; results on the right, the mean of 3 independent experiments; error bars indicate standard errors of the mean. B, THP-1 cells induced with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, and expression of Mer (white bars) was analyzed with flow cytometry. MDMs were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, and SR-A expression (black bars) was analyzed by means of Western blotting. The signals measured were quantified with ImageJ software. Expression of Mer and SR-A in cells transfected with control siRNA was set at 100%. Results represent the mean of 4 (Mer expression) to 6 (SR-A expression) independent experiments. C, HeLa cells, which do not express endogenous Mer or SR-A, were transfected with the respective siRNAs and transduced with the indicated pseudotypes. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were analyzed 72 hours after transduction. Results represent the mean of 4 independent experiment performed with triplicate samples. The transduction of cells transfected with control siRNA was set at 100%. D, MDMs were incubated with the indicated concentrations of tannic acid transduced with the indicated pseudotypes, and transduction efficiency was determined as described above. Transduction of cells incubated with solvent (water) was set at 100%. Results represent the mean of 3 separate experiments performed with triplicate samples.

Augmentation of GPdriven entry upon TIM-1, Axl, and TIM-4 expression was either more pronounced or exclusively observed for EBOV-GP\u0394muc compared to EBOV-GP WT, suggesting that the presence of the mucinlike domain might modulate augmentation of GPdriven transduction by PtdSer-binding proteins. The inability of TIM-3 to augment entry is due to inadequate presentation of its PtdSer-binding domain [45] .

Indeed, we found that siRNAs against integrin \u03b1V and SR-A reduced GP-driven entry and EBOV infection of MDMs. Integrins \u03b1V\u03b23 and \u03b1V\u03b25 interact with milk fat globule-EGF factor 8, which in turn recognizes PtdSer [47] , suggesting that these factors might promote GP-driven entry in a fashion similar to TAM receptor kinases and their PtdSerbinding ligands growth arrest-specific protein 6 or protein S [44] . Such a scenario could be reconciled with a previous study reporting that recombinant \u03b15\u03b21 integrin or antibodies against \u03b21 integrin interfere with GP-driven entry [13] . However, subsequent work indicated that expression of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin is required for full activity of cathepsin L, which processes GP for binding to NPC1 [13, 48] . Integrin \u03b1V expression might thus promote macrophage entry of ebolaviruses via several mechanisms.",

            "text": "SR-A is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells and contributes to the macrophage uptake of a broad spectrum of ligands, including apoptotic cells [49] . EBOV-GP1 did not bind to cells expressing SR-A and directed expression of SR-A did not augment GP-driven transduction (not shown) but treatment of MDMs with SR-A-specific siRNA consistently reduced EBOV-GP-but not VSV-G-driven entry as well as EBOV infection. Furthermore, GP-driven transduction of MDMs was also inhibited by tannic acid and fucoidan (not shown), SR-A ligands [42, 50] , arguing for a role of SR-A in entry of EBOVs into macrophages. On the other hand, siRNA against SR-A also reduced GP-driven entry into SR-A-negative HeLa cells, and alveolar macrophages isolated from SR-A knockout and WT mice were equally susceptible to GP-driven transduction (not shown). Further studies are therefore required to fully define the potential role of SR-A in macrophage entry of ebolaviruses. Collectively, our results support the concept that ebolaviruses use apoptotic mimicry for infection of cell lines and macrophages and suggest that the set of factors exploited by the viruses for this purpose may be cell type dependent.",
