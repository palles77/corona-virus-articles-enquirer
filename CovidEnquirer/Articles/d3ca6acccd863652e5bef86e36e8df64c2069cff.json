Through such an analysis, the regression period of maternally derived antibodies and optimum vaccination time in calves can be recommended. A total of 10 farms were grouped as large (4)-, medium (2)-and small (4)-sized enterprises according to their animal population. Newborn calves (n: 94) delivered during a calendar month on the farms were studied. Blood samples were collected from these calves during their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th months of age. Blood samples were also taken from their dams during the first sampling. Neutralizing antibody titers were detected using the serum neutralization test (SN 50 ). New PI-3 and BVDV infections at the early stages of life were determined in the calves. Maternal antibodies began to decrease in the 2nd month for BRSV, BHV-1 and BAV-3 (97.8%, 25.5% and 91.4%) and in the 3rd month for PI-3, BVDV and BCoV (85.1%, 67% and 93.6%). It was concluded that maternal antibodies begin to decrease after the 1st month and that the possible first exposure of calves to respiratory viruses is after the 2nd month. Therefore, it is recommended that the first vaccination program including prime and booster doses can be applied between 2 and 4 months of age. Furthermore, re-vaccination of animals at 6 months after the booster dose is also suggested.",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a common health problem in cattle herds (Gulliksen et al., 2009b) , and BRD can be classified as the most important welfare health problem in calves. Financial losses related to BRD are due to animal mortality, body weight loss, yield loss, veterinary fees and medical cost. Although respiratory disease can be found in cattle of all ages, during the decline of passive immunity, weaning time and entrance into the feedlot, calves are most susceptible due to the intensive stress and exposure to pathogens (Muggli-Cockett et al., 1992) . On a Dutch dairy farm where 60% of the heifers younger than 3 months old were infected, s31.2 in economic losses were estimated per heifer due to pneumonia. In the same study, it was shown that the calculated losses for one seasonal outbreak were s27.0 per heifer up to 15 months old (Van Der Fels-Klerx et al., 2001) . Furthermore, the estimated annual economic loss due to respiratory tract infections is over $600 million in the USA (Smith, 2000) . The contribution of BRD to the total morbidity cases in the USA was estimated to be approximately 75% and was similarly reported to be 50-70% of all feedlot deaths (Edwards, 1996; Galyean et al., 1999; Loneragan et al., 2001) . The spread of BRD infections among young populations is extremely rapid: 91% of calves can be infected with BRD within the first 27 days after arrival to a feedlot (Buhman et al., 2000) . An insufficient level of maternally derived antibodies (Kimman et al., 1988) and adrenocortical-immunosuppressive factors, i.e., stress, crowded barns or bad shelter conditions, can lead to an increased incidence of infection in calves (Gulliksen et al., 2009b) .",

BVD viruses can persist in the cattle population through persistently infected individuals (IPI) (Mcclurkin et al., 1984) , and BHV-1 may create lifelong latency after primary infection (Ackermann et al., 1982) ; it was also reported that BRSV and BCoV may persist within herds (Heckert et al., 1991; Valarcher et al., 2001) . Virus clearance between outbreaks (Alenius et al., 1991; Elvander, 1996) and the reintroduction of new viral strains (Larsen et al., 2000) has been reported, and the seasonal incidence of BRD cases is generally higher during autumn and winter (Stott et al., 1980) .

The number of PI-3 seropositive calves was increased between the 1st and 2nd months and then a decline occurred up to the 6th month; the number of seropositive calves then began to increase again between the 6th and 8th months. The number of calves seropositive for BHV-1 declined up to the 6th month and then exhibited an increase up to the end of the study. For BVDV, an increase in seropositivity was observed between the 1st and 2nd months, followed by a decrease in the seropositive calf number up to the 4th month. The number of BAV-3 seropositive calves started to decrease after the first month, though an increase was detected between months 6 and 8, and the number of BCoV seropositive calves started to decrease from month 2 and increased between months 6 and 10. With the exception of BRSV and BHV-1, changes in the antibody titers against the tested viruses were compatible with the number of seropositive calves (Table 5 ). In addition to the changes in the seropositivity rates an increase was detected in seroconverted (changed from seronegative to seropositive state) calf number mostly at 4th and 10th months of age (Table 6) .

The antibody response against BVDV can reach a detectable level at 2-3 weeks after infection (Howard et al., 1992) . In addition to maternal antibodies, early-life infections may also cause an increase in this antibody. Thus, it can be postulated that the situation observed indicates that the BVD virus may circulate in the early period of life after birth. Another possibility is an intrauterine infection just prior to parturition. Hence, some calves can be seropositive at month 1 due to primary BVDV infection rather than maternal immunity. For PI-3, an increase in the number of seropositive calves at second month occurred, but unlike BVDV, the geometric mean antibody titer value was decreased (Tables 4 and 5) . The development of a low titer antibody response in infected calves and high rates of maternal antibody catabolization are thought to be the causes of the reduction in the geometric mean antibody titer for PI-3. Here, the presence of early-period infection can also be postulated.",

Antibody titers against PI-3, BVDV and BCoV reached the lowest level at the 4th month; for BAV-3, they reached their lowest level at the 6th month. The amount of maternal antibodies varies depending on the dam's immune status as well as colostrum quantity and quality. The total degradation of maternal antibodies against BRSV, PI-3, BHV-1 and BVDV is reported to require more than 6 months (Baker et al., 1986; Van Der Poel et al., 1999; Fulton et al., 2004) . The numbers of seropositive calves against BHV-1 and geometric mean values of antibody titers were quite low compared to the other studied viruses, including in the first month of sampling. Therefore, conclusion on the maternal antibodies against BHV-1 will not be adequate. It is considered that the sampled calves may have low antibody titers against BHV-1, as shown by the limited number of seropositive calves.",

Calves with new infections between months 4 and 10 were found for all the studied viruses (Tables 4 and 5 ). Based on these data, the first vaccination time should be between the 2nd and 4th months of age. To minimize the negative impact of the vaccine on passive immunity and to provide a stronger immunity, a booster dose is also recommended one month after the first application.

Thus, the importance of herd size may be matter of discussion for these viruses. In earlier studies (Ye\u015filba g and G\u00fcng\u00f6r, 2008; Raaperi et al., 2012) , studied populations were sampled only once, with the relationship between herd size and infection seroprevalence being determined. In the present study, the sampled population was followed up for 1 year (8 times). Consequently, the difference between this study and earlier ones may originate from the different survey methods. At this point, the number of seronegative individuals in the herd and the prevalence of infection can be more relatable to the prevalence of infection than the herd size. Some other factors, such as the route of transmission, propagation velocity, farm-animal density in the region, direct contact rate of the animals, number of visitors, and biosafety rules, should also be taken into consideration. Given these criteria, when the capacity of a herd is increased, direct contact between animals and the number of visitors will increase automatically. Therefore, herd size can be classified as one of the main risk factors for respiratory infections but not the only reason.",

According to results of this study, a first vaccination of calves against respiratory viruses between the 2nd and 4th months is recommended. Due to the nature of inactivated vaccines, a booster dose is also advisable. Another important result of this study is the possible introduction of infections after the 8th month of age. Therefore, re-vaccination of animals at 6 months after the booster dose may be useful. To extend the level and duration of maternal immunity, vaccination of dams may be beneficial prior to the birth of the calf. The elimination of animals latently infected with BHV-1 or persistently infected with BVDV should support the health status of herds.",
