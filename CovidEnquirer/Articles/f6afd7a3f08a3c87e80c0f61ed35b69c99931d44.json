The ocular adnexaeperiorbita, eyelids and lashes, lacrimal and meibomian glands -produce, spread, and drain the preocular tear film, physically protect the sensitive ocular mucosa, and cushion the globe. The redundant conjunctiva with its low-viscosity tear film allows rapid multidirectional eye movements. Lymphoid tissues within the conjunctiva and lacrimal glands furnish acquired immune defense. The cornea and its tear film fashion the major refractive surface of the eye. The sclera forms the wall of the globe and scaffolds the intraocular tissues. The eye's lens provides additional refractive power and filters ultraviolet light. The iris diaphragm dynamically regulates the amount of light incident upon the retina, and together with the choroid and optic nerve head provides immune effector cells to the interior of the eye. The retina transduces light energy into neural signals; retinal function is requisite for vision. The vascular choroid nourishes the outer layers of the retina. The anterior (aqueous) and posterior (vitreous) humors provide internal pressure sufficient for maintenance of normal anatomic relationships, nourish the interior ocular tissues, provide immunosuppressive factors necessary to the maintenance of immune deviation, and during infection act as conduits for the distribution of inflammatory cells derived from the iris, ciliary body, and optic nerve head.",

Viral infection of the conjunctiva results in vasodilatation, serous discharge, hyperplasia of conjunctival lymphoid follicles, and enlargement of the corresponding draining lymph nodes. Severe conjunctival infection can cause permanent scarring of the globe to the eyelids and turning in of the eyelashes against the eye. Viral infection of the corneal epithelium induces punctate epithelial cytopathic effect evident biomicroscopically as isolated swollen epithelial cells (punctate epithelial keratitis) and loss of individual epithelial cells (punctate epithelial erosions). When extensive, the punctate erosions may coalesce to form confluent epithelial ulcers with dendritic, dendritiform, or geographic morphology. With herpetic infection, corneal anesthesia can ensue, and in the absence of epitheliotropic neural growth factors, corneal epithelial integrity is impaired. Reduced corneal clarity and progressive sterile ulceration may result. Corneal stromal infection induces white blood cell recruitment; subsequent corneal scarring, vascularization, and lipid deposition may permanently reduce vision. Intraocular infection manifests in inflammatory cell deposits on the posterior surface of the cornea and on the vitreous scaffold, and in free-floating leukocytes and biomicroscopically visible protein spillage into the normally cell-free and protein-poor aqueous humor. Iridocorneal and iridolenticular adhesions may develop and lead to glaucoma and cataract. Retinal infection concludes with necrosis and lost function. Viral encephalitis and meningitis can result in cranial nerve inflammation and secondary dysfunction of vision and extraocular motility.",

Herpes simplex virus causes recurrent lytic epithelial keratitis when viral reactivation within sensory ganglia of the first division of the fifth cranial nerve gives rise to virus in the preocular tear film. Necrotizing herpes stromal keratitis follows viral reactivation within the cornea stroma. Intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea ( Figure 2 ) have been associated with human papilloma virus types 16 and 18. When infected with oncogenic human papillomaviruses, corneal limbal stem cells can provide a persistent source of dysplastic ocular surface epithelium. Molecular mimicry has also been demonstrated as an immunopathogenic mechanism in ocular disease. Systemic infection with hepatitis C virus is associated with autoimmunity against a corneal stromal antigen and peripheral ulcerative keratitis. In a murine model of herpes simplex infection, non-necrotizing stromal keratitis accompanies T-cell reactivity against a corneal protein antigenically similar to a herpes simplex coat protein.",

The eyelids, an intermittent barrier, periodically wipe the eye's surface free of debris and spread and drain the preocular tear film. The ability of the tear film to nonspecifically impede primary infection by viruses is unknown, although such mechanisms are well established for bacterial pathogens. An inhibitory effect of goblet cell-derived and intrinsic mucins and meibomian gland-derived lipids on viral adsorption to the ocular surface is speculative. Early in infection, aqueous tears from the main and accessory lacrimal glands furnish proinflammatory cytokines, and the conjunctival blood vessels provide both soluble and cellular components of innate immunity.

The normal cornea is considered an immune-privileged site due to the high success rate of corneal transplantation; it lacks blood vessels, lymphatics, resident lymphoid cells, and Langerhans cells, expresses Fas ligand on its surface epithelium, and demonstrates reduced delayed hypersensitivity responses. Because corneal inflammation and subsequent scar reduce vision, corneal function is best served by its reduced immunologic responsiveness, also known as immune deviation. Necrotizing inflammation presupposes infection beneath the surface epithelium, and follows chemokine synthesis by infected corneal stromal fibroblasts. In contrast to the cornea, the conjunctiva is well endowed with blood and lymphatic channels, lymphoid cells, and Langerhans cells, and demonstrates classical delayed hypersensitivity responses. The immunology of the interior eye is less well established, but immune deviation appears to extend beyond the cornea to the aqueous and vitreous humors and to the central retina.",

The classic triad of postnatally acquired measles -cough, coryza, and follicular conjunctivitis -can be accompanied by Koplik spots on the conjunctiva and a mild epithelial keratitis. Less common are optic neuritis, retinal vascular occlusion, and pigmentary retinopathy. Measles keratopathy, a major source of blindness in the nonindustrialized world, typically presents as corneal ulceration in a malnourished child.

Along with devastating central nervous system damage, ocular abnormalities occur commonly in SSPE, including central retinal (macular) hyperpigmentation and inflammation, optic nerve atrophy, peripheral retinitis, and ocular motility disorders. Cortical blindness can occur in the absence of ocular involvement. The most common ocular complication of mumps virus infection is dacryoadenitis, and this may occur concurrently with parotid gland involvement. Aseptic meningitis, associated oculomotor palsy, and optic neuritis also occurs.

One example is the dry eye so common in AIDS patients.

Simple follicular conjunctivitis occurs with infection by many adenovirus types and may be subclinical. Pharyngoconjunctival fever typically follows infection with adenovirus types 3, 4, and 7. As the name implies, patients have pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and fever, and may be misdiagnosed as having influenza. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, most often caused by adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37, is a highly contagious syndrome with significant morbidity. The conjunctivitis can be severe (Figure 3) ; associated inflammatory conjunctival membranes can permanently scar the eyelids to the globe. Corneal involvement begins as a punctate epithelial keratitis and may proceed to a large central epithelial ulcer. Stromal keratitis presents about 2 weeks after the conjunctivitis as multifocal subepithelial corneal infiltrates, and causes both foreign body sensation and reduced vision. The stromal infiltrates may resolve spontaneously, but can become chronic, require long-term treatment with corticosteroids, and cause persistent visual morbidity. A fourth ocular syndrome occasionally associated with adenovirus infection, AHC (discussed above), may be caused by adenovirus type 11. Interestingly, adenovirus type 11 also causes acute hemorrhagic cystitis. Follicular conjunctivitis (clinically indistinguishable from adenovirus conjunctivitis) can also be caused by Newcastle disease virus, an RNA virus that gives rise to fatal epidemics in poultry and infects the birds' human handlers.",

HSV-1 causes self-limited and relatively benign infections of the eyelids, the conjunctiva, and the corneal epithelium, but infections of the corneal stroma, uvea, and retina may result in chronic or recurrent blinding stromal keratitis, uveitis, and retinal necrosis, respectively. Elevation of intraocular pressure due to involvement of the trabecular meshwork is not uncommon and may help to differentiate herpetic uveitis from noninfectious causes. Postnatally acquired HSV-2 ocular infection, less common than HSV-1, causes disease similar in most respects to HSV-1. Neonatal herpes simplex infection, acquired during transit through the birth canal and usually due to HSV-2, commonly causes vesicular blepharitis and conjunctivitis, but can also cause permanent visual loss due to keratitis, chorioretinitis, optic neuritis, and encephalitis of the visual cortex.",

CMV retinitis is a major cause of morbidity in AIDS patients. Other infections, such as toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis, ocular syphilis, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and molluscum contagiosum of the eyelids are seen in immunocompetent as well as immunosuppressed individuals, but may be more severe and leave more profound deficits in HIV-infected patients. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus in young patients may be the first clinical clue to HIV infection. Acute retinal necrosis due to herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2, or varicella zoster virus, occurs more commonly in HIV-infected than in otherwise normal patients and can result in unilateral or bilateral blindness despite antiviral therapy.",

All of the tissues and structures within the eye are susceptible to viral infection, with consequences ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and blindness, and almost all known human viruses cause ocular disease. Often, the same virus can infect widely disparate tissues within an eye. Classical viral pathogenic mechanisms are readily demonstrated in the eye, but the fine functions of ocular tissues within the visual axis (cornea, anterior chamber, lens, vitreous, and macula) compel altered immune responsiveness. The eye is uniquely affected by viral infection and provides an exceptional model for studies of viral pathogenesis and immunity.",
