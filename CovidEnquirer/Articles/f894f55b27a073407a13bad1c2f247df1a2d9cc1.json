            "text": "The emergence of new pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), poses serious challenges to global public health and highlights the urgent need for methods to rapidly identify and characterize potential therapeutic or prevention options, such as neutralizing antibodies. Spike (S) proteins are present on the surface of MERS-CoV virions and mediate viral entry. S is the primary target for MERS-CoV vaccine and antibody development, and it has become increasingly important to understand MERS-CoV antibody binding specificity and function. Commonly used serological methods like ELISA, biolayer interferometry, and flow cytometry are informative, but limited. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput protein binding inhibition assay using image cytometry. The image cytometry-based high-throughput screening method was developed by selecting a cell type with high DPP4 expression and defining optimal seeding density and protein binding conditions. The ability of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit MERS-CoV S binding was then tested. Binding inhibition results were comparable with those described in previous literature for MERS-CoV spike monomer and showed similar patterns as neutralization results. The coefficient of variation (CV) of our cell-based assay was < 10%. The proposed image cytometry method provides an efficient approach for characterizing potential therapeutic antibodies for combating MERS-CoV that compares favorably with current methods. The ability to rapidly determine direct antibody binding to host cells in a high-throughput manner can be applied to study other pathogen-antibody interactions and thus can impact future research on viral pathogens. Niu et al., 2018; Wang et al., , 2015 Wang et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2015) . However, previous publications have also described neutralizing NTD-and S2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Chen et al., 2017; https://doi.",

Six CoVs are currently known to infect humans; four of which, HKU1-CoV, 229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, and OC43-CoV, circulate endemically causing relatively mild respiratory disease that is rarely lethal (Corman et al., 2018) . Zoonotic transmission of CoVs is associated with high mortality, exemplified by the 2012 emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) . Globally, MERS-CoV has resulted in 2249 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection, 798 of which have been fatal, and those statistics increase as the virus continues to cause outbreaks in the Middle East (WHO, 2018). Frequent regional outbreaks and pandemic potential of MERS-CoV support the need for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Monoclonal antibodies with broad neutralization activity could be used for both purposes.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV virions display surface spike (S) proteins. The two components of each S protomer include a head region (S1), which facilitates viral attachment, and a stem region (S2), which contains fusion machinery. MERS-CoV S1 is further compartmentalized into the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which binds to the host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) Raj et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) . Since RBD is involved in receptor binding, many antibody approaches thus far have focused on the MERS-CoV RBD subunit (Corti et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2016; Corti et al., 2015; Wang et al., , 2015 Wang et al., 2016) . With the recent structural elucidation of full-length MERS-CoV S trimer (Pallesen et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017) , additional antibody targets have become more feasible, including other regions in S1 subunit, quaternary epitopes, and the exposed heptad repeat regions in S2 subunit. While many monoclonal IgGs show promise in animal challenge models (Chen et al., 2017; Corti et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2016; Wang et al., , 2015 Wang et al., 2016) , and a polyclonal IgG has been rendered safe and tolerable in a phase 1 clinical trial (Beigel et al., 2018) , there are still no MERS-CoV-specific antibody products approved for non-investigational human use.",

Overall, mechanisms of action for MERS-CoV antibodies are not fully understood.

            "text": "Currently, MERS-CoV antibody function is studied from two broad perspectives, binding and neutralization. Antibody binding is typically studied via methods such as ELISA, biolayer interferometry, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Neutralization is often assessed via pseudovirus reporter or plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assays in immortalized cells (Perera et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013) . ELISA assays are limited by their inability to reliably assess antibody binding to protein antigens in their native conformation . Therefore, ELISA data can sometimes be misleading and potentially generate false-positive results. For example, full-length MERS-CoV S is known to have variable RBD conformations (Pallesen et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2017) , which may differentially bind to certain antibodies. With unlimited access to those epitopes in ELISA, binding to conformationally-dependent RBD-specific antibodies may be exaggerated. An alternative to ELISA is biolayer interferometry, which utilizes a tagged antigen bound to an affinity tip. Although this method may promote uniform protein orientation, it is limited by the requirement of tagged proteins to be immobilized to the affinity tip. In addition, a previous publication has also shown biolayer interferometry may have reduced sensitivity and reproducibility (Yang et al., 2016) . A major MERS-CoV antibody function is inhibition of DPP4 binding, which has to date been best studied by FACS (Pallesen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015) . FACS methods utilize an authentically folded protein on the cell surface; however, cytometers are relatively expensive and sophisticated instruments that require management by highlytrained specialists and on-going maintenance by service engineers. FACS also requires time-consuming warm-up procedures, laser calibration, and cleaning after each use. Therefore, identifying new methods to rapidly and effectively measure antibody binding and functional properties will facilitate the evaluation and screening of antibodies for MERS-CoV and other pathogens going forward.",

MERS-CoV S protein was used to investigate the inhibition of MERS-CoV S binding to host cells by various antibodies (G2, D12, and G4). To maximize the signal for MERS-CoV S binding, DPP4 receptors were expressed on target cells at high concentrations. For each tested cell type (A549, BHK-21, and VeroE6), transfection assays were performed with different concentrations of DNA, ranging from 0.02 to 2 \u03bcg. The concentration that produced the highest DPP4 expression was then selected: 0.1, 0.1 and 0.05 \u03bcg, for A549, BHK21 and VeroE6, respectively. Fig. 1A shows a visual comparison of DPP4 expression in A549, BHK-21, and VeroE6 cells.

In addition, BHK-21 cells are known to not have endogenous DPP4 receptor. Therefore, BHK-21 cells without DPP4 transfection served as negative controls for all experiments.",

Antibodies can also be raised to other epitopes, including NTD and S2 regions. We used mAbs that bind to different regions of MERS-CoV S to measure their ability to inhibit MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4-expressing cells. Both D12 (RBD-specific) (Fig. 4A,B) and G2 (NTD-specific, data not shown) inhibited MERS-CoV S binding in a dose-dependent manner. This phenomenon is exemplified by the fluorescence intensity of MERS-CoV S decreasing with increasing D12 mAb concentration ( Fig. 4A and B) . D12 binds to the same region of MERS-CoV S as DPP4 . The decrease in fluorescence intensity is attributable to the binding of MERS-CoV S to D12 mAb, which then prevents MERS-CoV S from binding to DPP4 expressed on BHK-21 cells. G2 binds the NTD region of MERS-CoV S which is adjacent to the RBD of its neighboring protomer. Although the G2 binding footprint does not overlap with that of DPP4 , these data suggest that G2 inhibits binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 by an unknown mechanism. It is plausible that G2 can sterically interfere with the RBD-DPP4 interaction or influence MERS-CoV S structure and stability. Binding inhibition curves reveal D12 (Fig. 4C) and G2 (Fig. 4D ) mAbs have the same IC 50 value (\u223c7.5 nM), suggesting a comparable binding constant to MERS-CoV S. The results correlated to previous biolayer interferometry experiments, showing those mAbs bound to MERS-CoV S1 . To confirm the binding interactions being measured by image cytometer were specific to MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4, G4 was utilized. G4 binds to the S2 region, which is spatially distant from the RBD-DPP4 interaction and thus did not exhibit any inhibition effects, as expected (Fig. 4E) .",
