            "text": "Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are considered widespread among cattle in Norway and worldwide. This cross-sectional study was conducted based on antibody-ELISA of bulk tank milk (BTM) from 1347 herds in two neighboring counties in western Norway. The study aims were to determine the seroprevalence at herd level, to evaluate risk factors for BRSV and BCoV seropositivity, and to assess how these factors were associated with the spatial distribution of positive herds. The overall prevalence of BRSV and BCoV positive herds in the region was 46.2% and 72.2%, respectively. Isopleth maps of the prevalence risk distribution showed large differences in prevalence risk across the study area, with the highest prevalence in the northern region. Common risk factors of importance for both viruses were herd size, geographic location, and proximity to neighbors. Seropositivity for one virus was associated with increased odds of seropositivity for the other virus. Purchase of livestock was an additional risk factor for BCoV seropositivity, included in the model as in-degree, which was defined as the number of incoming movements from individual herds, through animal purchase, over a period of five years. Local dependence and the contribution of risk factors to this effect were assessed using the residuals from two logistic regression models for each virus. One model contained only the xand y-coordinates as predictors, the other had all significant predictors included. Spatial clusters of high values of residuals were detected using the normal model of the spatial scan statistic and visualized on maps. Adjusting for the risk factors in the final models had different impact on the spatial clusters for the two viruses: For BRSV the number of clusters was reduced from six to four, for BCoV the number of clusters remained the same, however the log-likelihood ratios changed notably. This indicates that geographical differences in proximity to neighbors, herd size and animal movements explain some of the spatial clusters of BRSV-and BCoV seropositivity, but far from all. The remaining local dependence in the residuals show that the antibody status of one herd is influenced by the antibody status of its neighbors, indicating the importance of indirect transmission and that increased biosecurity routines might be an important preventive strategy.",

Several infections, such as bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), have been eliminated through successful control programs (Sviland et al., 2015a (Sviland et al., , 2015b \u00c5kerstedt et al., 2015) . However, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are endemic and prevalent in the national herd (Gulliksen et al., 2009) . The prevalence of these infections is considered high in most parts of the world, and they cause disease problems leading to reduced animal welfare, increased use of antibiotics and financial loss for the farmer (Valarcher and Taylor, 2007; Boileau and Kapil, 2010; Sacco et al., 2014) . BRSV causes respiratory disease, most often in young animals, and bronchopneumonia due to secondary bacterial infection is common (Larsen, 2000) . BRSV was the most commonly isolated agent in respiratory outbreaks in cattle herds in a recent Norwegian study (Klem et al., 2014a) . BCoV is the cause of calf diarrhea, respiratory disease and winter dysentery (contagious diarrhea in adult cattle) (Boileau and Kapil, 2010) have shown significant effects of BCoV infection on production in terms of decreased milk yield and poor growth rate (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001; Beaudeau et al., 2010b) which both result in economic loss.",

For control-and eradication purposes, locating high and low risk areas is important in order to know which control strategies should be applied to different regions. Risk factors like herd size, animal movement between herds, and proximity to neighbors are likely to vary geographically. However, it is currently not known how geographical differences in risk factors are associated with the spatial variation in prevalence of positive herds for these two viruses. Because the spatial pattern of antibody-positive herds may be largely driven by the spatial patterns of herd characteristics, such as herd size and distance to neighbors, spatial clusters of positive herds might only be reflecting the geographical distribution of known characteristics. Hence, it is of major interest to determine if adjusting for these factors changes the appearance of the spatial clusters.",

Livestock movements are often registered in central databases which allows for calculation of in-degree, but factors affecting indirect transmission can be more difficult to assess because information on movement of people and biosecurity routines are not readily available in central registries. Nevertheless movement of people is associated with herd size, because larger herds have more visitors (N\u00f6remark et al., 2013) .",

One BTM sample from each of 1347 herds was collected by the dairy company (Tine, Norwegian Dairies SA), between December 2012 and June 2013. In 2013, 1854 herds delivered milk in the two counties, which means samples were collected from 73% of all eligible dairy herds. Milk samples were treated and analyzed as described in Section 2.2, and each herd was categorized as either positive or negative based on the BRSV and BCoV antibody test results, respectively. If a herd contributed more than one sample during the study period, only the result from the first sample was included. Prevalence estimates were calculated for the region as a whole and for each county separately. True prevalence was calculated using the Rogan-Gladen-estimator based on the sensitivity and specificity of the tests as specified by the manufacturer (Greiner and Gardner, 2000) .",

All recordings were from the year of 2012. To describe the general characteristics of the herds in the area the mean, standard deviation and range were calculated for the following herd parameters retrieved from tables of annual summary data in the NDHRS: herd size, milk production, somatic cell count (SCC), overall herd disease incidence, and replacement rate. Herd size was defined as the herds' mean number of cow-years in 2012 (one cowyear = 365 days for a cow in a herd, calculated for each cow from date of first calving). SCC was measured as mean somatic cell count in BMT and milk production was measured as kg milk produced per cow-year. Herd disease incidence was the combined incidence rate for all recorded diseases per 100 cow-years in 2012, where recorded diseases include all cases treated by a veterinarian as this is reported in on-herd health recordings. Replacement rate was the number of cows in first lactation divided by the herds' number of cow-years, multiplied by one hundred. Reports of respiratory disease was available at the individual level, and this information was dichotomized to whether or not the herd had one or more animals with reported respiratory disease during the year of 2012. Herds that were not NDHRS members, or had incomplete registrations during this time, had to be excluded from the risk factor analysis, but were still included in prevalence estimates, point maps and isopleth maps.

Biologically plausible pairwise interactions between significant variables from the final models were assessed by adding their cross-product in the model and then determining if the coefficient for the term was statistically significant. For interactions, a more stringent criterion was used for model inclusion (p < 0.02) in order to choose the most parsimonious model. Possible confounding factors were identified through a causal diagram and monitored by calculating the changes in other covariates when one factor was added and withdrawn from the model. The final models were fitted using a manual backward stepwise procedure, with a selection threshold of p < 0.05. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate overall model performance, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used as a test for the model\u00eds goodness of fit, with data grouped in ten groups on the basis of percentiles of estimated probability.",

Point maps were created to show the point location of all study herds with respect to their antibody status for the two viruses. Kernel density estimation was used for both BRSV and BCoV positive herds in addition to all herds, using the isotropic Gaussian kernel function implemented in the \"spatstat\" library in R (Baddeley and Turner, 2005) . Kernel density estimation is a weighted moving average method that can be used to estimate the intensity, or mean function, for point processes (Berke, 2005) . The resulting values can be presented as a raster map with one density value for each grid cell. A common fixed bandwidth determined from the coordinate ranges from the study herds ((1/8) \u00d7 min(x range ,y range )) was used. Dividing the range distance by eight was done to avoid over smoothing the intensity function, as reported elsewhere (Vanderstichel et al., 2015) . Generating a risk map with spatial point data (locations of cases and non-cases) is based on the ratio of two intensities as described by Berke (2005) . Thus, the isopleth map showing prevalence risk on a smoothed color scale was made by dividing the Kernel density raster layer for the cases by the Kernel density raster layer for the background population.",

The association between herd size and BRSV and BCoV positivity is well documented (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999; Norstr\u00f6m et al., 2000; Sol\u00eds-Calder\u00f3n et al., 2007; Ohlson et al., 2010) . The dairy production in Norway is typically organized in small units with a mean of 24.2 cow-years per herd in 2013 (Anon., 2015) . Even though this is smaller than in most developed countries this association holds true. The reason for the association remains unclear; however, it may be linked to larger herds having more indirect contact for instance via visits from veterinarians, AI technicians, advisory personnel or others (Norstr\u00f6m, 2001) . Furthermore, herd size might be associated with differences in management, and larger herds might provide better conditions for intra-herd virus circulation.",

            "text": "It is interesting that in-degree was only a significant predictor in the BCoV model, and not for BRSV. For the study population, the majority of purchased livestock came from within the region, and the fairly low herd level prevalence of BRSV in this region could explain why the number of ingoing contacts (in-degree) was not associated with BRSV positivity. The most commonly purchased animals are calves and young-stock, and because the prevalence on calf level is lower than on herd level, the risk of buying a young animal with either current viral infection or antibodies might not be high enough to show an association with the outcome. The prevalence of BCoV is higher, and thus the risk of buying antibody positive or infected animals is also higher, and more likely to affect the BTM result. A biological explanation behind differences in the likelihood of direct transmission between the two viruses should also be considered. An important difference in the pathogenesis of the two viruses is that BCoV replicates both in cells in the respiratory tract and intestinal epithelial cells, leading to shedding of virus in nasal secretions as well as in feces (Boileau and Kapil, 2010) . On the other hand, BRSV only replicates in cells of the respiratory tract (Valarcher and Taylor, 2007) . However, several important aspects of the pathogenesis are common for the two viruses: Shedding of virus is highest in the acute stage of the infection and disease can vary from subclinical to severe (Larsen, 2000; Cho et al., 2001; Boileau and Kapil, 2010) .",

Association between existence of bordering herds and BRSV was also found by Saa et al. (2012) . Another study found that the odds of BCoV positivity decreased as the distance to the nearest cattle herd increased, but no association was found for BRSV (Ohlson et al., 2010) . Norstr\u00f6m (2001) found an increased risk of outbreak of BRSV if at least one positive herd was within a radius of 500 m of a herd. BRSV and BCoV are enveloped viruses, with relatively short survival time outside the host, depending on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and light (Hall et al., 1980; Larsen, 2000; Wolff et al., 2005; Casanova et al., 2010) . As the number of infective virions on equipment decreases over time, the likelihood of indirect transmission by fomites decreases with increasing travelling time and therefore distance. Distance to neighbors will also influence on the number of possible indirect contacts for a herd, and thus the likelihood of exposure. This effect might be more evident during periods of high infectious pressure (epidemics). It is also possible that the distance between herds is associated with the risk of direct transmission, if animals in herd dense areas have more contact during pasture time in the summer. However, we did not have any information on the location of pastures.",

The cluster analyses on the residuals showed that some of the local dependence changed when correcting for other risk factors. In other words, local dependence seems to be partially explained by spatial variation in the distribution of risk factors included in the logistic regression model, such as proximity to neighbors, herd size and large geographic trends (xand y-coordinates). However, spatial clusters of high residual values from the final models indicates that there are still spatially dependent unmeasured risk factors. No information on biosecurity was available and good hygiene and husbandry practices could be an unmeasured preventive factor. A study by Ohlson et al. (2010) showed a preventive effect of using boot covers on BCoV positivity. Other non-measured potential risk factors that could be spatially dependent include the use of common grazing, and historical data on previous disease outbreaks. Both winter dysentery and respiratory disease typically occur as epidemics with years between (Boileau and Kapil, 2010 ). An epidemic spread of these viral infections might cause all, or the majority of, herds in an area to be antibody positive, and thus affect the spatial distribution of positive herds for years.",

These changes in the log-likelihood ratio mean that adjusting for geographic differences in herd size, proximity to neighbors and in-degree results in a more random distribution of the residuals. However, the effect was not uniform for all clusters, indicating that the effect of the risk factors might not be the same in all areas. Compared to the BRSV-model, the moderate values of observed/expected for the BCoV clusters from the Bernoulli model also support that local dependence might be more important for BRSV than for BCoV. The spatial clusters of BRSV antibody positive herds had high values of observed/expected from the Bernoulli model, and there were relatively small changes in log-likelihood ratio of the clusters between the xy-and the final model, which might indicate strong local dependence. This also agrees with the lower predictive ability of this model compared to the BCoV model (AUC values 0.73 and 0.81, respectively). For BRSV the results imply the existence of spatially dependent unmeasured risk factors and that each herd relies strongly on the status of its neighbors, thus indicating the importance of indirect transmission routes. The implementation of a high level of biosecurity could, therefore, be important to prevent virus introduction. The higher overall predictive ability of the BCoV model compared to the BRSV model means that despite a higher overall prevalence of BCoV it is easier to predict the serologic status of a herd, or to locate \"high risk herds\", for BCoV than for BRSV, based on the number of animals purchased and relatively constant factors like herd size, proximity to neighbors and location. The difficulty in finding strong associations between the investigated risk factors and BRSV positivity, and the strong local dependence, could mean that the spread of BRSV in this region has been of a more epidemic character, involving more stochasticity than what has been the case for BCoV.",

The high proportion of sampled herds (73% of all eligible herds) also minimizes the risk of severe selection bias that could have affected the validity of the study. However, the prevalence estimates in the 153 herds that were excluded from the multivariable analysis due to incomplete NDHRS registrations, were slightly higher than for the entire population of sampled herds, which could indicate differences in, for example, management. But because the excluded herds represented only 11% of the sampled herds, and the difference in prevalence was modest, the introduced bias is likely to be small. The unknown location and BRSV-/BCoV status of beef herds in the area could potentially bias the results if the proximity to neighbors variable is incorrectly specified. However, the authors believe it is unlikely that their geographic distribution differs substantially from the distribution of dairy herds. The x-and y-coordinates were included in the models to reduce spatial heterogeneity. However, spatial correlation structures in the data may be more complex than a simple latitudinal/longitudinal gradient. In case of overdispersion due to spatial autocorrelation, this could alter the effective sample size, leading to increased chance of Type I error. However, given the low p-values and the inclusion of the x-and y-coordinates in the models, it is unlikely that the significance or direction of the effect estimates would change. The results of this study are believed to be representative for the Norwegian dairy herd as a whole, because the management systems for dairy production are comparable across the country. The external validity is therefore deemed good, and the results might also be valid for other temperate areas of smallerscale dairy production.",

Adjusting for these risk factors explains some of the spatial clusters of positive herds, but spatial clusters of unexplained variation in the outcome was also detected. The remaining local dependence indicates that the antibody status of one herd is influenced by the antibody status of its neighbors and that indirect transmission is likely to be important. This means that a joint effort in terms of implementing preventive measures in an area could be an effective way to lower the prevalence of these infections.
