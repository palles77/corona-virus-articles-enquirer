Cases of nonfatal occupational injury and illness among HCP are among the highest of any industry sector. 1 The risks and methods preventing occupational acquisition of infection by HCP have been reviewed. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Minimizing the risk of disease acquisition is based on 6 key recommended practices: (1) proper training of HCP at initiation of health care practice and annually (eg, infection control practices and sharp injury prevention); (2) immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases 2,6,8-11 ; (3) evaluation of HCP who were exposed to communicable diseases for receipt of PEP 2,12-14 ; (4) adherence to standard precautions when providing patient care, 15 especially the performance of appropriate hand hygiene before and after patient care [16] [17] [18] ; (5) rapid institution of appropriate isolation precautions for patients with a known or suspected communicable disease 15,19,20 ; and (6) proper use of personal protective equipment, such as masks, N95 respirators, eye protection, and gowns when caring for patients with potentially communicable diseases. 15, 21 Prevention of laboratory-acquired infection requires adherence to recommended administrative protocols (eg, no eating, drinking, or smoking in areas where microbiologic or pathologic samples are processed), engineering controls (eg, containment hoods), personal protective equipment (eg, N95 masks when culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and appropriate immunizations. 22, 23 DEFINITIONS HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons providing services in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and/or infectious materials, including body substances, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or contaminated air. These HCP may include but are not limited to those listed in Box 1. In general, HCP who have regular or frequent contact with patients, body fluids, or specimens have a higher risk of acquiring or transmitting infections than do HCP who have only brief contact with patients and their environment (eg, beds, food trays, and medical equipment). All HCP who work within the confines of a health care facility, however should be covered by the occupational health service (OHS) and receive appropriate screening and pre-exposure prophylaxis even if they do not provide direct patient care because they frequently interact with HCP providing direct care and are, therefore, at risk for acquiring or transmitting infectious pathogens.",

            "text": "All HCP with potential exposure to blood or body fluids should be immune to hepatitis B. Influenza vaccine should be offered to all HCP yearly. In the past few years, editorials and commentaries have recommended that yearly influenza immunization (unless contraindicated) should be a condition of employment for HCP. [29] [30] [31] In February 2012, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee issued a statement that provided recommendations on how to achieve the Healthy People 2020 annual influenza vaccine coverage goal (90%) for HCP; for facilities that have implemented the recommended initial strategies but have \"not consistently achieved the Healthy People goal for vaccination coverage of HCP in an efficient and timely manner,\" it was recommended that they should \"strongly consider an employer requirement for influenza immunization.\" 32 HCP should be provided vaccines that are recommended for adults, 28 such as human papillomavirus, herpes zoster (HZ), and pneumococcal vaccines, or referred to their local medical provider. In special circumstances, HCP and laboratory personnel and researchers should be offered immunization with other vaccines, including polio, rabies, hepatitis A, vaccinia (smallpox), and anthrax (Box 3). In addition, HCP who are traveling outside the United States for work-related activities should be evaluated and provided CDC recommended immunizations, such as typhoid, cholera, and Japanese encephalitis. 33, 34 Immunocompromised HCP require special consideration in the provision of immunizations. 8, 27, 28, 35 First, live, attenuated virus vaccines (eg, measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] vaccine; varicella vaccine; and live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) may be contraindicated. Second, vaccines not routinely recommended may be indicated (eg, pneumococcal, meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b). Third, higher antigen doses (eg, hepatitis B vaccine in people with end-stage renal disease), additional doses of vaccine (eg, rabies vaccine in immunocompromised persons), or postimmunization serologic evaluation may be indicated (eg, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs] titer after hepatitis B vaccine or antibody response to rabies vaccine) because immunization of immunocompromised people may elicit a lower antibody response. Finally, such personnel should be individually evaluated for reassignment (with the consent of the employee) depending on their job duties. Caring for an immunocompromised patient is not a contraindication to receipt of a live, attenuated vaccine, although HCP receiving LAIV should not work in a protected environment (eg, stem cell transplant unit) for 7 days postimmunization. 28, 36 Pregnant HCP also require special consideration in the provision of immunizations. The risks from immunization during pregnancy are largely theoretic. 27 The benefit of immunization among pregnant women usually outweighs the potential risks for adverse reactions, especially when the risk for disease exposure is high, infection would pose a special risk to the mother or fetus, and the vaccine is unlikely to cause harm. 27, 28, [37] [38] [39] [40] Furthermore, newer information continues to confirm the safety of vaccines given inadvertently during pregnancy. Ideally, women of childbearing age, including HCP, should have been immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, meningococcus, polio, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B as children or adolescents before becoming pregnant. Because this may not have occurred, however, it is especially important that all HCP be screened for immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases. Nevertheless, live, attenuated vaccines should be provided only to nonpregnant HCP and deferred for pregnant women. The ACIP has recommended that \"healthcare personnel should administer [tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis] Tdap during all pregnancies, preferably during the third or late second trimester (after 20 weeks' gestation).\" If not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum. Women who are pregnant during respiratory virus season should receive inactivated influenza immunization. 28 There is no convincing evidence of risk from immunizing pregnant women with other inactivated virus or bacterial vaccines, or toxoids. Susceptible pregnant women at high risk for specific infections should receive, as indicated, the following vaccines: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcal polysaccharide, meningococcal, rabies, and poliovirus (inactivated) (see Box 3). 27 The indications for use of immunoglobulin preparations are the same in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Breastfeeding does not adversely affect the response to immunization and is not a contraindication for any of the currently routinely recommended vaccines. Before the administration of any vaccine, HCP should be evaluated for the presence of condition(s) that are listed as a vaccine contraindication or precaution. 27 If such a condition is present, the risks and benefits of vaccination need to be carefully weighed by the health care provider and the patient. The most common contraindication is a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or to a vaccine component. Factors that are not contraindications to immunization include the following: household contact with a pregnant woman; breastfeeding; reaction to a previous vaccination, consisting only of mild to moderate local tenderness, swelling, or both, or fever less than 40.5 C; mild acute illness with or without low-grade fever; current antimicrobial therapy (except for oral typhoid vaccine) or convalescence from a recent illness; personal history of allergies except a history of an anaphylactic reaction to a vaccine component; and family history of allergies, serious adverse reactions to vaccination, or seizures. 27 ",

More than 30 different pathogens have caused documented occupational infection after exposure to blood or body fluids in HCP or hospital laboratory personnel. 44 The most important blood-borne pathogens are HIV, HBV, and HCV. 44, 45 The key features for assessing the risk of transmission of HBV, HCV, and HIV are for each agent their seroprevalence in the general population, their environmental survival, and transmissibility via percutaneous, mucous membrane or nonintact skin exposure. The seroprevalence of these viruses in the general population is HBV approximately 0.4%, HCV approximately 1.3%, and HIV approximately 0.31%. 46 HBV has been demonstrated to survive and remain infectious greater than 7 days on environmental surfaces. 47 The data on HCV environmental survival are varied, with articles reporting survival of 16 hours, 48 5 days, 49 and up to 6 weeks. 50 For HIV, the half-life has been reported as 28 hours, 51 with a maximum of several days. 52 The risk of transmission of HBV depends on the route of exposure, whether the exposed person is immune (via immunization or natural infection), and serologic status of the source patient. Rates of clinical hepatitis/serologic evidence of HBV infection in susceptible exposed HCP after a percutaneous exposure have been reported as 22% to 31%/37% to 62% if the source is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and but hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive; rates of transmission have been reported as 1% to 6%/23% to 37% if the source is HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative. 53 The risk of transmission of HCV after percutaneous exposure has been reported as 1.8% to 1.9% (range, 0%-7%). 46, 54 The risk of transmission of HIV after percutaneous exposure has been reported as 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.5%). 46 In addition to percutaneous transmission, the blood-borne viruses HBV, HCV, and HIV can be transmitted via blood or contaminated fluid exposure of mucous membranes, nonintact skin, or human bites. The risk of transmission by these routes has not been quantitated for HBV and HCV. The risk of transmission by the mucosal route for HIV has been reported to be 0.09% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.5%). 46 The risk of transmission of HIV via exposure of nonintact skin is likely less than 0.1% but has not been Box 5 Postexposure prophylaxis counseling of the exposed health care provider Information to be provided to health care providers who are exposed to an infectious agent completely quantified. The risk from a human bite has also not been quantified. Transmission of HBV, 55 HCV, 56 and HIV 57 by human bites, however, has been reported. Human bites that penetrate the skin, however, should be considered as possible 2-way exposure (from patient-to-HCP and HCP-to-patient). The CDC has estimated that approximately 385,000 percutaneous injuries occurred annually among HCP in the United States in the time period of 1997 to 1998. 43 Although the incidence of needlestick injuries has been reduced by advances in education, needle disposal, engineering changes, and personnel protection, institutions and HCP must continue to assume responsibility in further lowering the risk. Several methods of reducing exposure to blood and other potential infectious body fluids have been described (Box 6).",

The number of HBV infections among HCP declined by approximately 98% from an estimated 17,000 infections in 1983 to 263 acute HBV infections in 2010. 53 This decline was likely due to decreased exposure from improved work practice controls (see Box 6) and HBV immunization of HCP. The risk of HBV transmission from patientto-HCP provider remains, however, because there are an estimated 800,000 to 1.4 million persons in the United States living with chronic HBV infection. 53 The key method of preventing health care-associated HBV infection among HCP is HBV immunization prior to beginning direct patient care of all HCP with potential blood or body fluid exposure. Furthermore, all HCP should know their immune response to vaccination. For HCP immunized in training or at initiation of patient contact, an anti-HBs quantitative titer should be drawn 1 to 2 months after the last dose of vaccine. HCP with greater than or equal to 10 mIU/mL anti-HBs are considered immune for life. HCP who do not respond adequately should be reimmunized with 3 additional doses of vaccine and tested for immunity 1 to 2 months after the last (6th dose). HCP who have not responded adequately (!10 mIU/mL anti-HBs) should be tests for HBsAg. Nonresponders to 6 doses of vaccine should be counseled to return to report any exposures to blood or body fluids because they may be prophylaxed with HBIG (Table 3) . HCP, especially trainees, with a remote history of hepatitis B vaccine should have their immunity to HBV assessed using the algorithm recommended by the CDC. 53 HCP exposed to an HBsAg-positive patient should be evaluated for prophylaxis per the recommended CDC algorithm (see Table 3 ). HCP with known to have responded to vaccine (!10 mIU/mL anti-HBs) do not need any prophylaxis; unimmunized HCP or HCP with an unknown response should be managed per the CDC algorithm, which may entail the use of hepatitis B vaccine and/or HBIG. PEP should be provided as soon as possible but always within 7 days of exposure. 53 HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine can be administered simultaneously at separate injection sites.",

The effectiveness of HBIG when administered greater than 7 days after percutaneous, mucosal, or nonintact skin exposures is unknown. HBIG dosage is 0.06 mL/kg. b Should be performed 1 to 2 months after the last dose of the HepB vaccine series (and 4-6 months after administration of HBIG to avoid detection of passively administered anti-HBs) using a quantitative method that allows detection of the protective concentration of anti-HBs (!10 mIU/mL). c A responder is defined as a person with anti-HBs !10 mIU/mL after !3 doses of HepB vaccine. d A nonresponder is defined as a person with anti-HBs less than 10 mIU/mL after !6 doses of HepB vaccine. e HCP who have anti-HBs less than 10 mIU/mL, or who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated, and sustain an exposure to a source patient who is HBsAgpositive or has unknown HBsAg status, should undergo baseline testing for HBV infection as soon as possible after exposure, and follow-up testing approximately 6 months later. Initial baseline tests consist of total anti-HBc; testing at approximately 6 months consists of HBsAg and total anti-HBc.

The following antiretroviral agents should be used for PEP only with expert consultation: abacavir/ABC (Ziagen), efavirenz/EFV (Sustiva), enfuvirtide/T-20 (Fuzeon), fosamprenavir/FOSAPV (Lexiva), maraviroc/MVC (Selzentry), saquinavir/SQV (Invirase), and stavudine/d4t (Zerit).

Chemoprophylaxis for HCP should be recommended even if the HCP has been vaccinated with either the conjugate or polysaccharide vaccine. 8 Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest immediately after onset of disease in the index patient, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally less than 24 hours after identification of the index patient). Conversely, chemoprophylaxis administered greater than 14 days after exposure to the index patient is probably of limited or no value.

Multiple nosocomial outbreaks of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have been reported. 8 Nosocomial transmission has been attributed to delays in the diagnosis or reporting of varicella or HZ and in failures to implement control measures promptly. In hospitals and other health care settings, airborne transmission of VZV from patients with either varicella or HZ has resulted in varicella in HCP and patients who had no direct contact with the index case patient. 80 Although all susceptible patients in health care settings are at risk for severe varicella disease with complications, certain patients without evidence of immunity are at increased risk: pregnant women, premature infants born to susceptible mothers, infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation or who weigh less than or equal to 1000 g regardless of maternal immune status, and immunocompromised persons of all ages (including persons who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, have malignant disease, or are immunodeficient). 80 Guidelines for postexposure management of HCP exposed to varicella or zoster have been published by the CDC, 8 AAP, 41 and APHA. 42 Exposure to VZV is defined as close contact with an infectious person, such as close indoor contact (eg, in the same room) or face-to-face contact. Experts differ regarding the duration of contact; some suggest 5 minutes, and others up to 1 hour; all agree that it does not include transitory contact. 41 PEP with vaccination or varicella-zoster IG depends on immune status of the exposed HCP. HCP who have received 2 doses of vaccine and who are exposed to VZV (varicella, disseminated HZ, and uncovered lesions of a localized HZ) should be monitored daily during days 8 to 21 after exposure for fever, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms suggestive of varicella. HCP can be monitored directly by occupational health program or infection-control practitioners or instructed to report fever, headache, or other constitutional symptoms and any atypical skin lesions immediately. HCP should be excluded from a work facility immediately if symptoms occur. 8 HCP who have received 1 dose of vaccine and who are exposed to VZV should receive the second dose within 3 to 5 days after exposure to rash (provided 4 weeks have elapsed after the first dose). After vaccination, management is similar to that of 2dose vaccine recipients. Those who did not receive a second dose or who received the second dose greater than 5 days after exposure should be excluded from work for 8 to 21 days after exposure (see work restrictions discussed later).",

HCP are not at greater risk for diphtheria than the general population. 8 For HCP exposed to nasopharyngeal secretions of a patient known or suspected to have diphtheria, the following postexposure measures should be taken regardless of their immunization status: (1) surveillance for 7 days for evidence of disease; (2) culture for Corynebacterium diphtheria, and (3) antimicrobial prophylaxis with erythromycin (1 g orally for 7-10 days) or a single injection of penicillin G benzathine (1.2 million U intramuscularly \u00c2 1). Asymptomatic exposed HCP should also receive a booster dose of Td, if they have not received a booster dose of a diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine within 5 years (Tdap is preferred if the HCP has not received a dose of Tdap previously). 41 Exposed HCP should not receive equine diphtheria antitoxin because there is no evidence that antitoxin provides additional benefits for contacts who have received antimicrobial prophylaxis.",

Nosocomial measles is well documented in the literature and may aid in the propagation of community outbreaks. 8, 84, [102] [103] [104] Investigations of individual outbreaks have reported that 17% to 59% of cases were acquired in a medical setting. Measles represents an important health hazard for HCP because of the following: (1) it is highly infectious; (2) transmission via the airborne route; (3) persons become infectious 4 days before the onset of the characteristic rash; and (4) transmission in the outpatient setting has occurred even though the index cases had left the waiting or examination room up to 75 minutes earlier. Because of the greater opportunity for exposure, HCP are at higher risk than the general population for becoming infected with measles.",

After a human bite, a semicircular or oval area of erythema or bruising is usually visible; the skin itself may or may not be intact. Wound care of a human bite is similar to that of an animal bite. 106 The bite area should be managed as follows: (1) clean the wound with an antiseptic; (2) trim any superficial devitalized tissue; (3) remove any foreign bodies or gross wound contaminants; and (4) assess the injury for tendon damage, vascular damage, or penetration into bone or joint. Most human bites should be left open to heal by secondary intention. If the wound may lead to a poor cosmetic result (eg, facial bites), however, the clinician may choose to close the wound. Human bites frequently develop infection. In general, all HCP with a human bite should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis with the first dose provided as soon as possible after the injury. 107 An initial parenteral dose of antibiotics is often provided to rapidly obtain an effective tissue level followed by 3 to 5 days of oral antibiotics. 107 Recommendations for specific antimicrobial therapy have been published. 107 All HCP suffering bite should be assessed as to whether tetanus prophylaxis should be provided. As discussed previously, human bites may lead to patient-to-HCP and HCP-to-patient transmission of blood-borne pathogens (HIV, HBV, and HCV).

            "text": "Rabies is primarily a disease of animals. 108 The epidemiology of human rabies is a reflection of both the distribution of the disease in animals and the degree of contact with these animals. Rabies is most commonly acquired via a bite or scratch from a rabid animal or from contact between nonintact skin and infective saliva. Saliva and nerve tissue are highly infectious. Generally, contact with other body fluids does not constitute exposure. Uncommon routes of infection include contamination of mucous membranes, corneal transplantation, exposure to aerosols from spelunking or laboratory activities, and iatrogenic infection through improperly inactivated vaccines. Human-to-human transmission has been rarely reported. 108 Human rabies cases in the United States are rare, with only 1 to 3 cases reported annually. 109 Rabies prophylaxis may occasionally need to be provided to HCP who work out-ofdoors (eg, maintenance workers and personnel who care for grounds) and suffer a bite from a wild animal that could potentially transmit rabies (fox, raccoon, and so forth) or who have bat exposure. Concern about rabies transmission is frequent among HCP who have cared for human patients with rabies, especially because fluids from the upper and lower respiratory tracts of humans frequently test positive for rabies virus. One review article reported that approximately 30% of HCP who provided direct care for a patient with rabies were provided PEP. 110 The CDC recommends that patients with possible or known rabies be cared for using standard precautions. 15 Given HCP concerns and the rare possible risk of rabies transmission, however, the authors believe that HCP should use PPE to prevent contact with a patient's saliva and respiratory secretions (ie, gown, gloves, and face shield or mask with eye protection). HCP with mucous membrane or percutaneous skin exposure to a potentially rabid animal or human should receive postexposure rabies vaccine and rabies IG as recommended by the CDC. 111 Ectoparasites Exposure of HCP to ectoparasites (eg, scabies or pediculosis) is likely common. Such exposed personnel should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of an infestation and provided appropriate therapy for confirmed or suspected scabies. 2 Prophylactic treatment should not be provided to personnel, however, who have had skin-to-skin contact with patients or other persons with ectoparasites (eg, scabies). 2 Syphilis HCP are at risk for acquired syphilis via unprotected contact with syphilitic skin lesions, such as chancres (primary stage) and rashes or sores (secondary stage). It can also be acquired via contact with secretions of children with congenital syphilis. 112 Prior to the standard practice of using gloves by HCP to examine patients with skin lesions, there were reports of extragenital syphilitic lesions on HCP. Therefore, HCP who have had unprotected contact with a patient with early congenital syphilis before identification of the disease or during the first 24 hours of therapy should be examined clinically for the presence of lesions 2 to 3 week after contact. 41 Serologic testing should be performed and repeated 3 months after contact or sooner if symptoms occur. HCP with unprotected contact of skin lesions of a patient with primary or secondary state disease should be similarly managed. If the degree of exposure is considered substantial, immediate treatment should be considered. 41 The most current CDC sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines should be used to guide postexposure therapy. 113 ",

Decisions on whether to administer antivirals for chemoprophylaxis should take into account an exposed person's risk for influenza complications, the type and duration of contact, recommendations from local or public health authorities, and clinical judgment. Chemoprophylaxis with antiviral medications is not a substitute for influenza vaccination when influenza vaccine is available. HCP receiving PEP should be informed that chemoprophylaxis lowers but does not eliminate the risk for influenza, that susceptibility to influenza returns once the antiviral medication is stopped, and that influenza vaccination is recommended if available.
