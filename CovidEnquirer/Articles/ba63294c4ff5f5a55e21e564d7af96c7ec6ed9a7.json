To date, vaccines developed against HEV still need to be improved and a structural gene (ORF2), which encodes a capsid protein with high sequence conservation found across HEV genotypes, is a potential candidate. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against HEV infection, four small interference RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting ORF2 gene were constructed. A challenge against HEV infection by RNAi was performed in A549 cells. Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time qPCR) and Western blot assay demonstrated that four HEV specific siRNAs (si-ORF2-1, si-ORF2-2, si-ORF2-3 and si-ORF2-4) were capable of protecting cells against HEV infection with very high specificity and efficiency. The results suggest that RNAi is a potent anti-HEV infection prophylaxis strategy.",

RNAi is a phenomenon in which small double-stranded RNA molecules induce sequence-specific degradation of homologous singlestranded RNA (Hannon, 2002) . RNAi is a powerful tool to investigate gene function through specific suppression of a particular mRNA, and has been employed in therapeutic studies of human diseases, including cancer, neurogenerative diseases and viral infectious diseases. Similar strategies were capable to reduce significantly SARS-CoV replication (Akerstrom et al., 2007) and hepatitis C virus mRNA accumulation (Liu et al., 2006) , which suggests that RNAi may be one of the most useful antiviral therapy strategies currently being investigated. As the field of RNAi has expanded, much research has been reported for many genes of interest, including oncogenes and viral genes, indicating their successful silencing in both cells and animal models (Akerstrom et al., 2007; Kirchhoff, 2008; Kleinman et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2006) . There have also been a number of clinical trials using RNAi strategies, including one on agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) (Kleinman et al., 2008) , and more applications are expected.",

This was used as template for a reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction PCR (RT-nPCR) to amplify the HEV ORF2 gene. The ORF2 gene encodes the major structural or capsid protein of HEV (Riddell et al., 2000) . The external forward primer and reverse primer were 5 0 -CGATTTTGCGCTT-GAGCTTGA-3 0 (P1) and 5 0 -TGGAGACCGAGCGCACGGCAC-3 0 (P2), respectively. The internal forward primer and reverse primer were 5 0 -CTCGGCGGGCTCCCGACAG-3 0 (P3) and 5 0 -AGGTGCGAGGACACCAACGGCAG-3 0 (P4), respectively. RT-nPCR analysis was conducted using an AMV Reverse Transcriptase XL kit for RT-PCR (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's directions. The RT-PCR protocol performed included a reverse transcription phase at 42 8C for 30 min and 85 8C for 15 s. Two microliters of the cDNA synthesized were then amplified by nested PCR at 94 8C for 2 min, followed by 94 8C for 30 s, 42 8C for 30 s and 72 8C for 1 min, and repeated for 29 cycles. The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/mL ethidium bromide. The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into the multicloning site of a eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, a gift from Dr. Wei Liu) which contains the reporter gene of enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP), using standard cloning procedures with the restriction sites of EcoRI and BamHI. The EGFP gene was located downstream of the target genes. The recombinant plasmid was named pEGFP-ORF2.",

RNAi, its exquisite specificity in seeking targets, which determines the exclusive protection against hepatitis E virus. HEV specific siRNAs were capable of preventing HEV infection in A549 cells. Antiviral activity was demonstrated both in mRNA transcription level by Real-Time qPCR and in protein expression level by Western blot. These findings indicate that this protocol may be an effective antiviral strategy for protecting host cells against viral invasion.",

The main obstacles are prevention of degradation of siRNA and avoidance of side effects to the host induced by siRNA itself. Couzin (2006) and Grimm and Kay (2007) mentioned the toxicity of both siRNA or shRNA expression vectors in vitro and in vivo, and cell apoptosis was observed when vectors were introduced at a high concentration. Although the RNAi pathway is a promising treatment for cancer, virus and hepatitis therapy, there are serious safety issues that first need to be addressed (McBride et al., 2008) . There needs to be a focus on decreasing the toxicity that accompanies siRNA treatment.",
