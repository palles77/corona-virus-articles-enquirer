Andrographolide and its derivatives have been widely used for treating respiratory infections in China and India for decades. It contains diterpenoids, flavonoids and polyphenols as the major bioactive components [4] . Andrographolide is the major diterpenoid in A. paniculata, making up about 4%, 0.8%~1.2% and 0.5%~6% in dried whole plant, stem and leaf extracts respectively [5] [6] [7] . It is also used as a wonder drug in traditional Sidha and Ayurvedic system of medicine as well as tribal medicine in India for multiple clinical applications, since ancient and also been shown to be effective against certain cancers and is an effective purgative. The plant extracts exhibit antityphoid and antifungal, antihepatotoxic, antibiotic, antimalarial, antihepatitic, antithrombogenic, antiinflammatory, antisnake venom and antipyretic properties to mention a few, besides its general use as an immunostimulating [8] [9] [10] [11] . Andrographolide has been tested in different experimental studies on human and animals which proved andrographolide was a safe drug with no harmful side effects [12] .",

Andrographolide have been identified as the highest binging energy of -10.88 Kcal/mol, 3 hydrogen bond interactions (Arg152, Lys150, and Gly197), total intermolecular energy of -12.07 Kcal/mol with bioactivity value (Ki) of 10.59 nmol/L, while the Food and Drug Admistraton approved drug Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have shown 2 and 4 hydrogen bond interactions with binding energies of -6.28 Kcal/mol and -7.73Kcal/mol, respectively, which is higher than andrographolide. The guanidine group of Arg152 has binding affinities to the hydrophilic nature of the inhibitors (-OH and =O groups), as identified by docking of andrographolide (CID: 5318517) on neuraminidase.",

World Health Organization reported 12 787 cumulative confirmed cases and 413 cumulative deaths cases, all caused by H1N1, on 18 Oct 2009 [13] . H1N1 contains two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Hemagglutinin facilitates the influenza virus to attach to a host cell during the initial infection and viral RNA enters the cell by endocytosis. Neuraminidase cleaves \u03b1-ketosidic linkage between the sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic) and an adjacent sugar residue and spread infection in cells. The amino acid sequence of neuraminidase is coded by the 6th RNA segment and the polypeptide chain and neuraminidase comprises of 470 amino acid residues. The inhibition of neuraminidase is useful in prevention of H1N1 and could serve as potential drug target. Due to development of resistance in many strains of H1N1, the Food and Drug administration approved neuraminidase inhibitor drugs such as Oseltamivir and Zanamivir [14] [15] [16] . Moreover, due to several sides effects like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and headache, rash and sometimes allergic reactions including anaphylaxis etc, there is a call for new inhibitors against H1N1 influenza A virus with less or no side effects.",

The number, area, circumference of mouth openings of each pocket in solvent and molecular accessible surface was determined by CASTp [25] . Ligand binding site on a protein was predicted by Q-site finder. Binding of hydrophobic probes to proteins are used to determine binding energy of the probe clusters on the protein and probe clusters with favourable binding energy are arranged in an order [26] .

The default size was used for the bounding and enclosing boxes.

Ten independent docking runs were carried out for each ligand and results were clustered according to 1.0 \u01fa RMSD criteria.

The final model, which we took for further analysis, consisted of 469 amino acid residues with a resolution of 2 \u00c5. Both PROCHECK and Verify3D softwares have been used to check the quality of the modeled protein structure. Ramachandran plot obtained from the program PROCHECK, which checks the stereochemical quality of a protein structures, producing a number of postscript plots analyzing its overall and residue-by-residue geometry, assured the reliability of the modeled protein with 83.3% residues in most allowed region and 10.8% in additional allowed region. There were none residues in disallowed region and only 0.9% in generously allowed region ( Figure  2 ). The assessment with Verify3D, which derives a \"3D-1D\" profile based on the local environment of each residue, described by the statistical preferences for: the area of the residue that is buried, the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) and the local secondary structure, also substantiated the reliability of the three-dimensional structure. Active sites were identified with reference to the studies done on 3TI4 using CASTp, Q-Site finder and further verified from available literature (Table 1 ). Here, we combined the results obtained from a standard docking protocol and then investigated efficiency for andrographolide derivatives and other four herbal compounds imperatorin, andrographolide, epigallocatechin and arabinoxylan from Angelica archangelica, A. paniculata, Green tea and Hyphomycetes mycelia, respectively (Figures 5-8) . Lig 0 O Docking simulation of andrographolide derivatives to the homology modeled ACZ97474 was performed using A utodock4.2. A ll the 1 4 0 andrographolide ligands were docked into the defined binding site. The top 10 configurations after docking were taken into consideration to validate the result ( Table 2 ). The RMSD value calculated out of ten accepted poses for each configuration was found in between 0.59-1.33 \u00c5. This revealed that the docked configurations have similar binding positions and orientations within the binding site and are similar to the crystal structure. The best docked structures which are the configuration with the lowest binding score are compared with the crystal structure as shown in Figures 2-8 . Docking of andrographolide derivatives to this binding site was performed using the standardized docking protocol. The binding mode of andrographolide within the binding site is represented in Figure 5 . In this figure we can observe that both the molecules were well fitted to the defined binding pocket. All 140 andrographolide analogues were also found to be good binders with ACZ97474. The binding modes of andrographolide and its derivatives showed hydrophobic interaction with ACZ97474. This binding mode proved the hypothesis that the andrographolide derivatives bind to ACZ97474 with almost hydrophobic interactions and it should be the pre-organized shape binding between the rigid structure of andrographolide analogues and the binding pocket of ACZ97474. All the docking and interaction analysis were carried out as per our previous studies [32] [33] . ",

Influenza A viral infection is still a major health concern, and the options for the control and treatment of the disease are limited. In recent years the normally mortality associated with influenza H1N1 virus that circulated five years ago also hit younger people, is highly noticiable and this variant of the virus appears to be even more lethal. The strains of influenza H1N1 virus is unexpected mutate year to year, therefore it is important to get an annual flu vaccine [35] . Unfortunitely all vaccines are immune suppressive i.e. they suppress our immune system, which might increase the risk of contracting the flu or other infectious disease. Since vaccines bypass your natural first-line defense, therefore, they are never 100% protective and typically provides inferior immunity compared to our body would receive from naturally contracting and recovering from a disease. Additionally, Flu vaccinations are particularly ineffective which is reducing illness and mortality from the flu [36] . According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about 20% of flu-like illnesses are actually caused by influenza type A or B and the other 80% are caused by more than 200 other viruses such as respiratory virus, bocavirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus, etc. Therefore this threat of a new pandemic requires the development of new therapeutic agents.",
