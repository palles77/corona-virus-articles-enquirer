In infected pigs, at the height of diarrhea, short-circuited ileal epithelium failed actively to transport Na+ and Cl-, and there was a defect of glucose-mediated Na+ transport. The Clsecretory response to theophylline remained intact. Conductance measurements indicate that paracellular permeability may be reduced and transcellular transport may be altered. A mucosal lesion was observed at the time of the transport changes, characterized by villus blunting, crypt hyperplasia, and immature crypt-type enterocytes on the villus epithelium, deficient in disaccharidase and (Na+, K+)A TPase activity but rich in thymidine kinase. Consideration of the major determinants of diarrhea in this invasive enteritis must take into account not only altered mucosal function and differentiation but also the extent of intestinal involvement, including the ileum, a major site of fluid absorption in the intestine.",

' - 5 The TGE virus is thought to invade mainly the epithelium of the proximal intestine, 6 where abnormalities of water and electrolyte transport have been observed in vivo and in vitro at the height of diarrhea. 1.3 In jejunum in vitro, a specific defect of glucose stimulated sodium transport has been identified,3 a defect that coincides with the presence on the villous epithelium of immature crypttype enterocytes. 4 To assess the role of distal small intestine in the pathogenesis of this viral diarrhea, we measured Na+ and CI-transport across ileal epithelium in vitro at the height of diarrhea and changes in mucosal structure and epithelial differentiation. The ileum is an important site of fluid absorption in the intestine, and we postulated that altered ileal ion transport, a primary driving force for fluid absorption,7 may be a major determinant of the severity of viral diarrhea.",

Severe ileal transport disturbances could contribute to the pathogenesis of the diarrhea. Active sodium transport across ileal epithelium was defective under basal conditions, evidenced by negligible PD, short-circuit current, and net fluxes, and, as previously found in jejunum,3 there was failure of glucose-stimulated Na+ transport. In keeping with these observations, we found deficient Na+, K+ -ATPase activity in cells isolated from ileal villi, indicating a defective active Na+ \"pump\" in the basolateral membrane. In addition to alterations in transcellular active transport, unidirectional CI fluxes are reduced, and our electrical data indicate that tissue resistance (reciprocal of conductance) is raised, which implies an alteration in the low-resistance shunt properties of infected tissue. This may indicate a reduction in the size of extracellular pathways and therefore permeability, because shunt conductances of Na, K, and CI appear to account for a large portion of total conductance in intestinal tissue. 12 These alterations would be expected severely to affect water transport and lead to a net accumulation of water and electrolytes in the lumen, thus contributing to the diarrhea. The intact CI-secretory response to theophylline shown by the flux data supports previous findings that epithelial adenyl cyclase activity is unchanged in TGE,' which suggests that CI ion secretion mediated by cyclic AMP is not stimulated and does not playa role in the diarrhea. Previously, using an in vivo marker perfusion technique, we failed to find significant abnormalities of ion transport in the distal ileum of TGE-infected pigs. The discrepancy between these earlier in vivo data and the present in vitro findings could be due to (a) a difference between the two studies with respect to the extent and severity of the mucosal lesion or (b) factors affecting ion transport in vivo that cannot be assessed in vitro (e.g., blood and lymphatic flow). We suspect the former is the case, although, of course, we cannot exclude the latter. In the present study, the impact of the infection did extend into the ileum, as indicated not just by alteration of iontransport phenomena but also by structural and enzyme abnormalities. Our experience of ileal involvement in TGE is similar to that reported by oth-ers6 and is similar to that of other viral enteritides in infant animals. '3 -'5 The TGE virus invades primarily the epithelium of proximal small bowel, but invasion can extend for a variable distance to distal intestine.\" Although the dose of virus and the timing of our experiments was constant, piglets were younger in the present studies than those studied in vivo. It is known that TGE is particularly severe in younger animals,'6 as is the case for other viral enteritides,'3-15 including human rota virus in humans.17 Clearly, the question of the relationship between age-determined severity and the extent of the intestinal lesion needs study.",
