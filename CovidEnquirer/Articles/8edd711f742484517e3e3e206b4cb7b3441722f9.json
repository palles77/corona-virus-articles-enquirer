            "text": "An outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea occurred in the summer of 2014 in Ukraine, severely affecting piglets <10 days of age; the mortality rate approached 100%. Full genome sequencing showed the virus to be closely related to strains reported from North America, showing a sequence identity of up to 99.8%. P orcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PED virus (PEDV) was first recognized in the United Kingdom in 1971 (1) . Since then, outbreaks of PED have been documented in several European and Asian countries (2) . PED has been reported in China since the 1980s; however, in October 2010, more virulent strains of PEDV emerged there, causing high fatality rates among suckling piglets (3) . Since May 2013, similar virulent PEDV strains have been reported in the Unites States (4), and a report from Ohio indicated a second incursion into the USA by a slightly different PEDV strain (USA/OH851/2014, GenBank accession no. KJ399978), characterized by focal deletions in the S gene (5) . PEDV was subsequently reported from Mexico (6), Canada (7) , and other countries in the Americas (online Technical Appendix, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/21/12/15-0272-Techapp1.pdf).",

We confirmed these findings at the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency using an in-house PEDV PCR and a commercially available PEDV/transmissible gastroenteritis virus quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A BLAST search (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi) of the 160-nt PCR amplicon revealed the highest similarity (99%) to PEDV strains from the United States and China. PEDV RNA was then subjected to deoxyribonuclease I digestion and converted to cDNA for preparation of sequencing libraries by using a Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. The consensus sequence was obtained by de novo assembly by using the Velvet 1.2.10 algorithm (12) of the sequence reads that mapped to the reference strain (GenBank accession no. NC003426).",

KJ645637.1) and USA/Colorado30/2013 (GenBank accession no. KJ645638.1), with 99.8% nucleotide identity. The nucleotide identity was substantially lower (98.5%) when compared to those of the 2014 strains isolated in Germany, which are similar to another strain isolated in North America, Ohio851/2013 (8) . Accordingly, the Ukraine virus clustered phylogenetically with PEDV strains from North America in genetic clade II (6) but was distinct from strains currently and previously found elsewhere in Europe, such as the prototype PEDV strain CV777, with which it shares only 96.5% homology (Figure [13] ). However, the genetic analysis does not, at this stage, support drawing conclusions regarding the relative pathogenicity of this apparently virulent PEDV strain, similar to past instances of PEDV in Europe, of which very few have been characterized; parallel experimental infection of pigs would be required for further investigation.",

Persons on the farm practiced strict biosecurity measures to maintain a specific pathogen free status. No breach in biosecurity could be identified after a review of potential PEDV introduction routes involving pigs or humans or vehicles, equipment, and other fomites; the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Ukraine source of infection remains unknown. However, there were reports of a PED-affected pig farm 1.5 km from this unit, and the potential for unidentified fomite or other transmission from this herd, or another undisclosed infected herd, therefore existed.

The full-length genomes of PEDV were aligned by using the MegAlign software of the DNASTAR Lasergene Core Suite (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA) and phylogenetic analysis was done by using MEGA 5.2 software (13). The tree was constructed by using the neighbor-joining method and 1,000 bootstrap replications. Only bootstrap values of more than 50% are shown in the figure. Each virus on the tree is represented by accession number, strain, and year of sample collection. Ukraine/ Poltava01/2014 clusters in close proximity to recent strains in the United States other than the Ohio851 variant, and both are substantially genetically different from the previous European variants, such as the prototype strain CV777, which is embedded in another cluster. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.",
