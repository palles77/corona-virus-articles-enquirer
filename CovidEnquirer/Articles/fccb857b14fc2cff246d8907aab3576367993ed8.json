            "text": "Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150e250 ng per 10 9 CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments. Fig. 2. Expression of PsaA in different LAB strains. (A) Western blot analysis from protein extracts show the constitutive expression of PsaA in L. lactis (L. l. PsaA), L. casei, (L. c. PsaA), L. plantarum (L. p. PsaA) and L. helveticus (L. h. PsaA). PsaA bands are pointed by an arrow. Lysates from respective control strains carrying the pT1NX empty vector are also shown in the figure. (B) Lysates from 10 9 cells of each recombinant LAB were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Concentrations from 40 to 640 ng of rPsaA were used as reference. The estimated amounts of PsaA are shown below the panel (20 ng for L. lactis; 200 ng for L. casei, 150 ng for L. plantarum and 250 ng for L. helveticus). (C) Supernatants recovered after treatment of the different strains with lyzosyme. Arrows point to the PsaA band.",

The high costs of medical care and the appearance of new clinical isolates with multidrug resistance led to the search for efficient new vaccines to prevent pneumococcal infection. Since the pathogen enters the host through the respiratory mucosa, a vaccine inducing the production of protective secretory IgA at this site, as well as systemic IgG antibodies, would be desirable.",

PsaA deletion mutants display low ability to adhere to mucosal cells and therefore are less pathogenic [3] . This characteristic may be due to differences in the modulation of pneumococcal adhesins caused by the absence of Mn 2\u00fe or Zn 2\u00fe in the cell [4] . PsaA is conserved among the 90 described S. pneumoniae serotypes and is also immunogenic, which makes it a good candidate for vaccine formulations. In fact, antibodies produced against PsaA by nasal immunization, using cholera toxin B subunit as adjuvant, were shown to protect mice against nasopharyngeal colonization by S. pneumoniae. This protection can be further increased by the co-administration of PsaA with the pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), another pneumococcal virulence factor [5, 6] . In another approach, oral immunization of mice with PsaA encapsulated in microspheres induced the production of IgG and IgA and resulted in protection against lung colonization and septicemia with five different S. pneumoniae strains [7] .",

These recombinant L. casei are being tested as potential anti-pneumococcal vaccines through nasal immunization of mice, but so far we could not detect significant levels of anti-PsaA IgA or IgG (unpublished data). The failure in stimulating the production of antibodies may be a result of the lack of PsaA or PspA expression in the recombinant L. casei after nasal immunization, due to the absence of the inducer in the host mucosa. For this reason, we decided to use a system that allows the constitutive expression of PsaA in different LAB strains. In this work, recombinant Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus helveticus expressing PsaA were evaluated for their ability to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses in nasally immunized C57Bl/6 mice. Nasal colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae in these mice was also analyzed.",

Ligation products were used to transform L. lactis and expression of PsaA was analyzed by Western blot of cell lysates. L. lactis carrying the constructed vector showed the expression of a protein around 37 kDa reacting against anti-PsaA antibodies, which was not present in extracts from cells carrying the empty vector ( Fig. 2A) . Recombinant plasmid isolated from L. lactis was used to transform different Lactobacillus strains. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from erythromycin resistant colonies showed the expression of PsaA in L. casei, L. plantarum and L. helveticus. The PsaA band was not observed in the respective strains carrying the empty vector ( Fig. 2A) . Using recombinant PsaA as reference, it could be calculated that 10 9 L. lactis CFU expressed approximately 20 ng of PsaA, while the amounts synthesized by the different Lactobacillus strains were about 150 ng (L. plantarum), 200 ng (L. casei) and 250 ng (L. helveticus) of PsaA (Fig. 2B) . PsaA was not detected in 10-fold concentrated culture media from these clones, indicating that secretion of the protein was not occurring (data not shown). However, analysis of the supernatant obtained after incubation of the cells with lysozyme, showed that at least part of the protein is being directed to the cell wall (Fig. 2C) . Moreover, when we incubated whole cells with mouse polyclonal anti-PsaA followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate and further revealed with OPD and H 2 O 2 , positive reactions were observed in all LAB expressing PsaA, indicating that at least part of the protein is exposed outside of the cell, in contrast to negative reactions observed for the LAB strains carrying the empty vector (data not shown).",

As can be observed in Fig. 3A , nasal inoculation with L. casei, L. plantarum or L. helveticus expressing PsaA induced specific anti-PsaA IgA in pooled saliva. No detectable levels of anti-PsaA IgA antibodies were observed in saliva collected from animals that received L. lactis expressing PsaA, the LAB strains carrying the pT1NX vector or saline. The animals were then subjected to nasal and bronchial washes for the analysis of the presence of IgA in the respiratory tract. In these samples, the highest IgA titers could be observed in animal groups that received either L. plantarum or L. helveticus expressing PsaA (Fig. 3A and B) with means significantly different from groups that received saline (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) and the respective controls carrying the empty vector (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Most of the animals that received L. casei expressing PsaA did not display detectable levels of IgA in nasal or bronchial mucosa. In this group, only a single animal showed a very high IgA titer, but the mean of the group was not significantly different from the controls (saline or L. casei carrying the empty vector, P > 0.05). The group that received L. lactis expressing PsaA displayed low levels of anti-PsaA IgA in nasal washes or even no detectable levels in bronchial washes ( Fig. 3A and B), with the mean values being not different from the saline group or the L. lactis pT1NX group (P > 0.05). Analysis of the sera collected from the same animals revealed that the animals that displayed the highest levels of anti-PsaA IgA also displayed the highest levels of anti-PsaA IgG, showing correlation in the production of these two classes of antibodies (data not shown).",

After the fusion to the Usp45 signal sequence, the recombinant PsaA protein was directed to the cell wall in the four LAB assayed, with no protein detected in culture supernatants. In a previous report, expression of PsaA in fusion with the leader sequence from the L. casei cell wall proteinase PrtP also resulted in the localization of the protein in the cell wall and no secretion to the culture media [27] . Since the sequence which specifies PsaA covalent anchoring to the cell surface in its natural streptococcal host is absent from our construct, it seems that this protein has the particularity to be retained in the cell wall in different bacteria.",

L. plantarum and L. helveticus turned out to be better in the development of mucosal and systemic anti-PsaA immune response than L. casei and L. lactis. Pooled saliva from the L. casei PsaA group displayed an IgA induction similar to those found in the L. plantarum PsaA or the L. helveticus PsaA groups (Fig. 3A) . However, when nasal or bronchial washes of individual animals in the L. casei PsaA group were analyzed, most of them displayed low or even no detectable levels of IgA, with only one animal producing a high titer of anti-PsaA IgA (Fig. 3A and B) . The high titer in this individual may be the cause of the anti-PsaA IgA observed in pooled saliva from the L. casei PsaA group (Fig. 3A) . Since L. casei expressed about the same amount of PsaA as L. plantarum and L. helveticus and was also recovered from mice nasal mucosa in the same period, the differences observed among L. casei and the other lactobacilli may reflect differences in their intrinsic adjuvant potential. In another study, Shaw and collaborators have shown that L. plantarum NCIMB 8826 expressing TTFC produced better results in oral immunization when compared to L. casei 393 [37] . In this case, L. plantarum persisted for up to 12 days in mice gastrointestinal tract whereas L. casei remained for about 72 h [37] . The inability of L. lactis expressing PsaA to significantly induce serum IgG or secreted IgA after nasal inoculation could be explained by the low level of expression in this strain compared to lactobacilli. In addition, it was observed that lactococci carrying the expression vector, remained in mice nasal mucosa only 1 day after the inoculation, while lactobacilli could be detected up to 3 days later.",

On the other hand, colonization of S. pneumoniae was significantly reduced in mice immunized with L. helveticus PsaA, when compared with the animals that received saline or L. helveticus pT1NX. A significant decrease in S. pneumoniae colonization is also observed in the group that received L. plantarum PsaA in relation to the group that received saline, but not in relation to the group that received L. plantarum pT1NX. In this case, a possible inhibition effect related to the strain may be taking place. However, it is important to notice that simply inoculation of the L. plantarum strain carrying the empty vector is not sufficient to cause a decrease in S. pneumoniae colonization. Interestingly the group that received L. casei carrying the empty vector displayed a significant reduction in S. pneumoniae colonization and this reduction was more accentuated in the group that received L. casei PsaA. Since the administration of this strain induced low levels of anti-PsaA antibodies, other mechanisms may be causing this reduction. In addition, although a correlation between antibody induction and inhibition of S. pneumoniae colonization was observed when we compared the groups that received L. lactis PsaA, L. plantarum PsaA and L. helveticus PsaA, this correlation is not always maintained when we analyzed the animals individually. Thus, the induction of anti-PsaA antibodies may be only one of the factors contributing to the reduction of S. pneumoniae colonization. Nasal immunization with recombinant PsaA in combination with other pneumococcal proteins and CTB as adjuvant [6] as well as oral immunization with microencapsulated PsaA and CTB [38] were able to induce mucosal and systemic antibodies and protect mice against S. pneumoniae colonization. These studies suggest a correlation between antibody production and inhibition of colonization. In another study using a colonization model in mice, nasal inoculation of S. pneumoniae resulted in mucosal antibody induction that was associated with clearance of the bacteria. However, no correlation was observed between the amount of antibodies detected in the sera or mucosa and the density of colonization of individual animals. In addition, animals with impaired humoral immunity displayed similar densities and durations of S. pneumoniae colonization than their normal counterparts. The authors discuss that other components of the adaptative immune response as well as innate immune response may be the main contributors for pneumococcal clearance in their model [39] .",

Absence of colonies in individual nasal washes is represented as 1. Induction of IgG by nasal immunization of mice with different LAB strains. Sera from individual mice were analyzed by ELISA for anti-PsaA antibodies. Log 10 of reciprocal antibody titers are shown. Animals that received the respective LAB strains carrying the pT1NX empty vector (L. l.; L. c.; L. p. and L. h.) or saline were used as controls. Results are representative of two independent experiments. The individual sera that displayed non-detectable anti-PsaA IgG titers were represented as <1.",
