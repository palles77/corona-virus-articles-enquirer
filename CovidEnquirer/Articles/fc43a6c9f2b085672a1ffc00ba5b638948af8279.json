Both small and large bowel are often affected, causing a chronic mixed bowel diarrhea. Antemortem diagnosis of intestinal mycoses can be quite difficult and requires histopathologic identification of organisms in tissue sections. In some animals with renal involvement, fungal hyphae may be visualized on routine urine sediment examination.",

Treatment with an oral imidazole may be needed for months to years, and long-term prognosis is generally grave. Nystatin (100,000 units/cat orally every 6 hr), ketoconazole (50 mg/cat orally every 12-24 hr), or itraconazole (5-10 mg/kg orally every 12-24 hr) may be considered for systemic candidiasis. 8 . Do cats develop protothecosis, mucormycosis, or pythiosis? Pythium insidiosum is a water mold associated with GI tract disease in dogs, primarily along the Gulf Coast. Infection of cats is rare. Infection with Mucorspp. fungi occurs in cats as a systemic disease. Protothecosis is a disseminated disease in dogs caused by the algae Prototheca zopfii and P. wickerhamii. Bloody diarrhea is a common manifestation. To date, only cutaneous protothecosis has been reported in cats.",

Some cats (25%) with Iymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis are reported to have mildly increased serum alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate transferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities. Liver function tests are usually normal; in some cats, however, histologic examination of the liver reveals periportal inflammatory infiltrates. Because the pancreatic and biliary ducts are shared in cats and empty into the duodenum, IBD may result in concurrent pancreatitis and cholangiohepatitis (see Chapters 29 and 36). This syndrome has been called \"triaditis\" and may explain serum biochemical evidence of hepatic and pancreatic involvement. Triaditis may be due to translocation of bacteria from the diseased 01 tract into the portal circulation. Cobalamin, folate, and vitamin K levels may be decreased as a result of malabsorption.",

Endoscopic mucosal biopsy is less invasive than surgery but provides small samples (usually 2.8 mm in diameter at most) that include mucosa only. Samples are easily obtained from the stomach, duodenum, rectum, and colon; the jejunum and ileum are less commonly sampled. Samples often have crush artifact, which makes histologic characterization difficult. Because only mucosa is obtained, deeper inflammation or neoplasia may be missed, and it is difficult to document the presence of Iymphangectasia. It is important to obtain samples even if the mucosal surface appears normal. Multiple samples should be obtained from each site. In dogs, duodenal aspirates are performed to assess for Giardia spp. and bacterial overgrowth. In cats, however, Giardia spp. reside more distally in the small bowel, and normal cats have extremely variable numbers of bacteria in the duodenum. Thus the diagnostic benefit of these tests is limited. If gastritis is suspected, samples should be collected from the cardia and placed on a urea slant to assess for the presence of urease activity, which supports the diagnosis of helicobacteriosis (see Chapter 20).",

Cyclosporine stimulates secretion of transforming growth factor beta, which inhibits interleukin 2-stimulated T-cell proliferation and generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. The primary side effects in people and dogs include inappetence, GI irritation, and gingival hyperplasia. Blood levels should be measured 24-48 hours after starting therapy to ensure adequate levels and periodically during therapy. The goal is a 12-hour wholeblood trough level of 250-500 ng/m!. Gelatin capsules may be needed for administration because of the unpleasant taste.",
