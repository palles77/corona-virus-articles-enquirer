Space considerations will limit this far from comprehensive review to an attempt to summarize recent data on BVDV in the context of our previous understanding of its molecular biology. Reference will be made to the other two pestiviruses, hog cholera virus and border disease virus, where pertinent. Discussions of the prototypes of other genera of the flaviviridae, yellow fever virus, and hepatitis C virus will be avoided; readers are referred to excellent reviews in the literature. 22 ,23 Bovine, ovine, and swine pestiviruses infect and replicate interchangeably in cells of any of these species, albeit with more or less efficiency. 15, 51, 74, 93, 126 Infection typically does not result in morphologic changes in the infected cell, thus these viruses are called noncytopathic (NCP). NCP-BVDV virus accounts for more than 90% of infections in cattle, thus we consider this biotype to be the standard BVDV.47 BVDV frequently is isolated from fatal cases of mucosal disease. 19 , 24, 61, 86, 121, 129 BVDV isolated from these cases often causes cytopathic (CP) effects in infected cultured cells and is called CP-BVDV.S6,78 CP-BVDV isolates are an eclectic group in nature with a variety of genomic abnormalities. 8o -82, 105,118, 119 We should note that although the standard BVDV is a noncytopathic virus, most in vitro and biochemical analyses discussed in this review were performed using one of two strains of CP-BVDV: NADL or Singer strains.2s,27",

Sequence conservation is not uniform along the genome. The most conserved nucleotide sequence blocks can be found in the 5'UTR (Figs. 1 and 2). Least conserved sequences are insertions of host cell-derived genetic information into p125/NS23 of some isolates of cytopathic BVDV (Figs. 1 and 3 ). Excepting these anomalies found in altered BVDV genomes, four stretches of very low sequence conservation are found among standard BVDV genomes. 34 Two hypervariable stretches are found in a region encoding for the major surface glycoprotein, gp53/E2. Two others are located in the nonstructural polypeptides p125/NS23 and p58/NS5A (see Fig. 1 ). Only one sizable deletion has been described in a replication-competent virus.

Nucleotide sequence similarity between BVDV and viruses in the other two genera of flaviviridae shows that hepatitis C virus has a most striking homology in the 5'UTR (see Fig. 2 ). 21, 23, 83 Nucleotide sequence identity levels in other regions of the genome are marginal, and statistical analyses are required to demonstrate that they are not just random matches. The conservation of the 5'UTR across highly divergent genera of the family flaviviridae points to some fundamental role of importance for viral replication. Recent experiments with hepatitis C virus suggest that this region of the genome can direct ribosomes to initiate translation from a downstream AUG triplet by a cap-independent mechanism. 122 Wobble and redundancy in the genetic code make comparison of nucleotide sequence similarity of protein-coding regions less sensitive to detect distant relationships than the alignment of the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Comparison of the encoded proteins sequences will often show significant similarities when nucleotide comparisons failed to do so. Alignment of pestiviral polyproteins with polyprotein of viruses in the other genera of flaviviridae shows a pattern of conserved blocks of sequence homology spread along most of the nonstructural protein region (Fig. 3 ).",

For biochemical analysis of structural proteins from virions, infected cells are grown in a culture medium supplemented with a radioactive isotope-containing amino acid. Metabolically radiolabeled virus is harvested from the medium and purified by density gradient centrifugation for subsequent analysis by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Analysis of nonstructural viral polypeptides in cells can also be performed by metabolic labeling of infected cells. Unlike many other viral infections, BVDV infection does not inhibit cell macromolecular synthesis. Inhibition of labeled amino acid incorporation into cellular polypeptides is thus required to identify viral polypeptides after electrophoresis, e.g., using hypertonic medium. 42 , 44 Alternatively, viral polypeptides can be distinguished from cellular protein by binding of specific antiviral antibodies, e.g., radioimmunoprecipitation and western blotting. 43 , 45, 54 These methods obviously are limited by the specificity of the polyclonal antiserum or the availability of a monoclonal antibody.",

Sequence redundancy among the 13 polypeptides identified by SDS-PAGE analysis of BVDV infected cells was predicated by biochemical and immunologic means. 1 Peptide mapping of two polypeptides of 80 and 125 kD showed a number of shared peptides in the fingerprint, consistent with the presence of regions of identical amino acid sequences. 1 Availability of monoclonal antibodies to some of these proteins subsequently showed that a single antibody recognized two or more polypeptides of different sizes, corroborating peptide mapping results. 8 , 29, 85, 109 Molecular cloning of the BVDV genome and determination of the primary structure of the genomic RNA paved the way to the establishment of the first genetic map of BVDV. Alignment of deduced BVDV protein sequences with other flaviviruses, reactivity of viral proteins with monoclonal antibodies and region-or peptide-specific antisera led to the initial protein map of BVDV.26 The latter were produced from short segments of the BVDV genome cloned into bacterial expression vectors. Purified BVDV -~-galactosidase fusion proteins expressed in recombinant bacteria were injected into rabbits to increase region-specific antibodies. Viral proteins in BVDV -infected bovine cells were identified with these antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation. This approach led to a map of the genomic regions encoding most of the viral polypeptides ( Fig. 4) .25,27 Further refinement of the map was achieved with the use of rabbit antibodies against synthetic pep tides deduced from the genomic nucleotide sequence. 2 The resulting map indicated very clearly that the BVDV polyprotein resulted in several processing intermediates before the mature viral polypeptides were produced. Previous difficulties to interpret existing data were virtually eliminated. Some of the proteolytic processing events were proposed to be cotranslational, because the entire 438 kD polyprotein was never identified in infected cells. Despite remarkable progress made in viral protein mapping and identification, the protein map of BVDV remains to be refined. Identification of a nonstructural polypeptide from a region of the genome that is highly conserved (NS4) awaits future experimental efforts. Precise determination of cleavage sites within the nonstructural region needs to be completed.",

The C-terminal domain is hydrophilic and homologous to NS3. The p 125 /NS23 polypeptide, and its C-terminal colinear fragment, p80/NS3, are the most studied proteins of BVDV. p80/NS3 has received a great deal of attention because it is found exclusively in cytopathic BVDV isolates. 43 ,100 Cytopathic isolates of BVDV produce p80/NS3 as a distinct polypeptide. The expression of p80/NS3 as a separate polypeptide resembles the protein profile of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses.",

Predictions based on sequence analyses would suggest that this is a relatively basic polypeptide with a pI of approximately 9.6. Wiskerkerchen reported a possible role for p32 in modulating the protease activity of p125/NS23 in the generation of p75/NS5B by cleavage at site 10 (see below). 130 The high level of sequence conservation suggests some as yet unknown important function for this polypeptide. Preliminary data suggest that this polypeptide accumulates in infected cells at late stages of infection with CP-BVDV. Cattle infected with BVDV fail to produce humoral antibodies to p32. Knowledge about this protein is limited. Its boundaries within the polyprotein have not been defined. Blocks of homology between this protein and the N-terminus of the NS5 (flavivirus RNA replicase polypeptide) suggest some role in RNA synthesis. Pestiviruses seem to have split its RNA polymerase activity in two polypeptides, p58 NS5A and p75/NS5B, in contrast with the arthropod borne flaviviruses, which have just one polypeptide, NS5. An alternative active form of the replicase may be a precursor polypeptide, p133, which is cleaved to yield p58/NS5A and p75/NS5B. Hepatitis C virus is similar to pestiviruses; two polypeptides are produced by cleavage of the polyprotein in this regoin, the main replicase and a possible accessory polypeptide. This polypeptide is relatively stable in infected cells. The sequence of this polypeptide displays considerable variability among pestiviruses. No humoral immune response to this polypeptide can be detected in convalescent cattle. 13, 45 p751NS5B This polypeptide has yet to be fully characterized biochemically and the processing site to be identified. p75/NS5B is the putative viral RNAdependent-RNA polymerase. The canonical motif present in all positive strand viral RNA polymerases, glycine-aspartate-aspartate, can be found between codons 3626 and 3628.

The common ancestry of these viruses is evidenced by the conservation of blocks of amino acid sequences in the nonstructural proteins of viruses of the family.27,70 The extent of conservation of these motifs is greater comparing members of the family to each other than when comparing them to other positive stranded RNA viruses. 55, 63 Conservation of blocks of amino acid sequence similarity across most of the nonstructural region of the genome points to the common ancestry of these viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of positive strand RNA viruses based on replicase, chymotrypsin-like protease, or the helicase sequences have all resulted in arthropod borne flaviviruses and pestiviruses originating from a common ancestor?O With the noteworthy exception of the leader papain-like protease present exclusively in pestiviruses, the rest of the viral polypeptides have a similar distribution along the genome (see Fig. 3 ). Important divergent features in the nonstructural region are represented by processing differences: pestiviruses do not process a site that in flaviviruses separates NS2 from NS3. In contrast, pestiviruses process NS5 into NS5A and B.2, 22,25,26 Besides the obvious conservation of critical motifs in replicase and protease-helicase, striking similarities between BVDV and hepatitis C virus are found in the 5 'UTR. 23, 35, 63, 83 The in vivo host range of a typical flavivirus includes mammals as well as insects. The host range of pestiviruses and human hepatitis C virus is restricted to a cluster of closely related mammalian species, i.e., Artiodactyla and Primate, respectively. A similar picture emerges for the ability of these viruses to grow in vitro: members of the genus Flavivirus grow in insect and various mammalian and avian cells: Pestiviruses are restricted to growth in cell cultures of Artyodactyla, whereas hepatitis C does not replicate efficiently in any cell culture. 55",

Rabbits are susceptible to infection with rabbit-adapted BVDV, and are the only known laboratory animal host for the virus. 52 The replication of standard BVDV and other pestiviruses in cell cultures of bovine origin takes place without production of visible changes in the cells. 87 In some cases, these viruses contaminate cell cultures for years without detectable alterations of cell physiology or metabolism. 11, 53, 77, 90, 103, 113 When BVDV comes in contact with a susceptible host cell, it initiates a series of steps that result in the production of progeny virions.

The nature of the defect is under investigation. Because this mutant cell is resistant to swine, ovine, and bovine pestiviruses, it is likely that pestiviruses use a common mechanism or pathway to enter target cells (Flores EF, Donis RO, unpublished data).",

BVDV seems to be extremely sensitive to the binding of monoclonal antibodies to its E2, an event that often leads to neutralization. 8 ,41 This loss of infectivity is not simply consequence of binding inhibition because most of these monoclonal antibodies are capable of neutralizing virus after attachment to target cells. 16 Antibodies to gp48 have low neutralizing capacity, and it is not known if they interfere with virus attachment by a mechanism other than virion aggregation. 16 After the initial virion attachment, an endocytosis step is required for infection. Endocytosis blockers such as phenylarsine oxide are efficient inhibitors of virus infection. 54 Infection proceeds if endocytosis is restored by reversing the chemical block with a reducing agent. Endosome acidification is required for virus entry, as evidenced by the ability of chloroquine or ammonium hydroxide to block infection (Donis RO, unpublished data)J6 If these drugs are added immediately after the virus entry step, they have no effect on virus replication. Presumably, increasing endosomal proton concentrations are required to trigger fusion of viral envelope with cellular membranes and release of the viral genome into the cytosol. Virtually nothing is known about the fusion event, conditional mutants have not been identified.

Thus the genome of an RNA virus is not a single defined entity, but an average or consensus of a heterogeneous population of molecules. The term quasispecies was coined to describe this concept of genomic variability.49 Many genomes in the quasispecies will not be viable because of the lethality of certain base substitutions. RNA viruses use this strategy to generate genomes with potentially greater fitness and ability to survive under certain altered environmental conditions. The consequences on this process are seen in practice in the form of neutralization escape mutants or the selection for viruses that are antigenically different from vaccine strains.4o, 95 Three major parameters have been used to characterize the viruses circulating in cattle populations: gene sequencing, antigenic analysis performed with monoclonal antibodies, and virulence studies by experimental inoculation. Recent antigenic and genetic characterization of a large number of BVDV isolates involved in atypical outbreaks of severe acute BVDV has shown the existence of much wider diversity among field virus isolates than previously acknowledged. 96 , 108 Two distinct lineages of BVDV co-circulate in cattle populations throughout the world; one is the classical genotype termed genotype I. The second lineage is known as genotype II.96, 108 Although these viruses have been identified recently, they seem to have been circulating in cattle populations for as long as we can analyze the viral fossil record. Genotype II BVDV prevalence, relative to genotype I, may be on the increase in the United States.

Experimentally, CP-BVDV inoculation into persistently infected cattle reproduces the disease. Production of nonstructural polypeptide p80/NS3 was identified as a biochemical marker of CP-BVDV isolates. It also represents a marker of virulence because CP-BVDV isolates are responsible for induction of mucosal disease. The mechanistic relationships between p80/NS3, cytopathology, and mucosal disease remain to be elucidated. The main obstacle to understanding these relationships is the inability to experimentally manipulate p80/NS3 production and the ability of BVDV to induce cytopathology. The availability of a cDNA copy of the genome that yields infectious transcripts will facilitate greatly experimental approaches to understand these processes. 123",

Multiple pathways lead to p80/ NS3 expression by cytopathic BVDV.47 These include recombination or base substitutions in the genomic RNA (Fig. 7) .47,60,80-82,105 Incorporation of foreign sequences into the BVDV genome is a common finding in CP-BVDV isolates. The foreign sequence insert in the Osloss strain encodes for exactly one bovine ubiquitin monomer, whereas the insert in NADL hybridized to uncharacterized bovine sequences (see Fig. 7 ). The insertion of cellular sequences in certain CP-BVDV isolates involves additional rearrangement and duplication of viral sequences. Whatever the changes, the result is a newly acquired p 125 /NS23 processing function to yield p80/NS3 or creation of a duplicated minigene expressing p80/ NS3. 47 , 60, 80-82, 105 Alternatively, p80/NS3 can be produced in trans by a defective BVDV genome, with a large internal deletion of the structural proteins. 119 BVDV isolates have been identified in which p80/NS3 is produced without evidence of gross genomic rearrangements, and mutations have been assumed to be responsible for processing at site 6 (see Figs. 5-7). The diverse collection of CP-BVDV isolates with alternative pathways to produce p80/NS3 is likely to be incomplete, but the unifying theme is always p80/NS3 expression.",

Alternatively, p80/NS3 may enhance BVDV replication. The resulting accumulation and biological activity of viral macromolecules may cause cellular pathology.

Cytopathic border disease isolates have been described; all of these also produce p80/NS3. 48 In Vivo Readout for CP-BVDV: Mucosal Disease. Two key elements are crucial in mucosal disease pathogenesis: first, the immunotolerance to BVDV; second, a CP-BVDV strain, antigenic ally identical or similar to the NCP-BVDV responsible for tolerance and persistence. 12 ,19, 20,86 CP-BVDV-induced cytopathology is certainly an in vitro phenomenon. The extent to which it takes place in vivo is unknown. The excellent correlation between BVDV cytopathology in vitro and mucosal disease suggests that cytopathology, alone, or cytopathology in conjunction with additional as yet unknown traits, is required for disease induction. Evolution of viruses that cause mucosal disease in persistently infected animals occurs over a period of several years. Cytopathogenicity may be only one of the traits that are selected in the course of persistent infection. Concomitant selection of other traits is possible. Mucosal disease could be viewed simply as a whole animal readout of a BVDV that evolved to acquire a cytopathic phenotype. Alternatively, cytopathogenicity may be a necessary trait but may not be sufficient for a virus to cause mucosal disease.",

The protease and helicase domains of p 125 INS23 are present in the region that is colinear with p80/NS3. Cytopathic isolates of BVDV invariably express p80/NS3, suggesting that this protein is directly or indirectly involved in cellular damage. The possible role of protease and helicase enzymatic activities in cytopathology is the subject of intense research. ~fected cattle (and cattle vaccinated with modified live BVDV vaccine) develop a strong humoral antibody response to p125/NS23. Cattle vaccinated with killed vaccine develop negligible humoral antibody to this nonstructural polypeptide. Antibodies to BVDV p125/NS23 cross-react with hog cholera virus p 125 I NS23 and vice versa; swine antibodies to hog cholera p125/NS23 cross-react with BVDV.94, 127, 128 A similar situation exists with border disease virus regarding immune crossreactivity.",

Enhancement of translation by 2A required the active protease; the effect is independent of its ability to shut off the host by cleaving p220.62 p80/NS3 may have a similar effect on BVDV translation, which could enhance RNA accumulation indirectly. 4. Mutations in the 2C protein of picornaviruses, shown to be a helicase, can increase virus growth dramatically in MRC-5 cells. A helicase can participate in the modulation of viral growth efficiency. It is possible that the helicase activity of p80/NS3 up regulates growth differentially by lacking the p54/NS2 attached to its N-terminus. 50 , 75, 112",
