Blood chemistry analysis showed that total protein and sodium concentrations were slightly lower than the normal range (Table 1) . Because vomiting and diarrhea lead to decreased total protein and sodium concentrations, these results were consistent with the observed symptoms. In contrast, the concentration of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (484 U/L) was higher than the normal concentration. Although high ALP concentration is associated with hepatic damage, it is frequently observed in normal puppies. Total white blood cells and red blood cells were in the normal range. Remarkably, the number of lymphocytes and neutrophils were 6.7\u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcl and 6.6\u00d7 10 3 / \u03bcl, respectively.

For primary PCR, ExCycF (5'-AAT GTA AAA CCC TTC CAG AGT AAC-3') and ExCycR (5'-GCA ATA ATC TAT CCC CAT CAC G-3') were used to amplify 18S ribosomal RNA locus. Nested PCR was performed with NesCycF (5'-AAT TCC AGC TCC AAT AGT GTA T-3') and NesCycR (5'-CAG GAG AAG CCA AGG TAG GCR TTT-3'). A 498-bp nested PCR product was confirmed on a 1% agarose gel and purified. The purified PCR product was cloned in competent E. coli using an All in One\u2122 PCR Cloning Kit (Biofact, Deajeon, Korea). Sequencing was performed with ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) using the Sanger dideoxy method. C. cayetanensis, C. ohioensis, C. canis, C. timonii, and T. gondii were used as outgroup species. Sequence alignment of 18S rRNA was performed using ClustalX2.1 (http:// softadvice.informer.com/Clustalx_2.1.html). The phylogenetic tree was analyzed using the neighbor joining method and generated using MEGA7 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). Sequence data of 18S rRNA obtained in this study were deposited in Genbank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Accession no. MH497583.1). Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA sequence showed a 98.79% homology with the C. ohioensis sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY618555.1) (Fig. 2) .

It has also been reported that some human cyclosporiasis cases in Guatemala, Peru, Nepal, Jordan, and Egypt may be associated with contact with C. cayetanensis-infected animals [2] . However, C. cayetanensis experimental infection in mouse, rat, sand rat, chicken, duck, rabbit, hamster, ferret, pig, dog, owl monkey, rhesus monkey, and cynomolgus monkey have failed [9] . Although zoonotic potential of C. cayetanensis seems to be low, public health guidelines emphasize on preventing its transmission from companion animals to humans. Canine cyclosporiasis has not been documented in Korea to date; however, it is necessary to monitor it in future research.",

Previous studies have reported high prevalence of canine cystoisosporiasis: 8.7% in Austria, 5.7% in north-eastern Italy, and 5.1% in the United Kingdom [3] . C. canis was the prevalent species in the United Kingdom, whereas C. ohioensis was preva- lent in Australia, Japan, and China [3] [4] [5] . Although other coccidian parasites are not associated with peripheral eosinophilia, it is known that cystoisosporiasis causes eosinophilic enteritis [1] . However, veterinary clinicians could not observe peripheral eosinophilia in the hematology profile ( Table 1 ). The veterinary hematology analyzer commonly used in Korea has only 3 channels for lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils; this limitation might hinder the diagnosis of C. ohioensis in dogs.",

In some previous studies, 18S rRNA for C. cayetanensis and 5.8S rRNA and ITS2 region for Cystoisospora belli were used for the development of multiplex PCR, whereas in other studies, 18S rRNA and ITS1 genes of Cystoisospora spp. were used for phylogenetic analysis [4, 5, 8] . For diagnostic purposes, detection by the 18S rRNA gene has limitations in differentiating C. cayetanensis from C. ohioensis. Therefore, ITS1, which is a high-copy number element of the genome commonly used as a DNA biomarker or DNA barcode, could be a promising target for detecting and differentiating C. ohioensis and C. cayetanensis. After the development of C. ohioensis species-specific PCR, its primer specificity should be tested with C. cayetanensis.",

However, an initial prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not improve the clinical signs of this case. A combination of clavamox (amoxicillin trihydrate/clavulanate potassium) and metronidazole was effective in the treatment of diarrhea in this case. Ciprofloxacin is an alternative drug for the treatment of diarrhea in HIV-infected patients or patients allergic to sulfa drugs [1] . Recently, nitazoxanide was used in the treatment of a C. cayetanensis-infected patient who was not responsive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [10] . Although ciprofloxacin or nitazoxanide was not prescribed in this case, notably, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not effective. Thus, a combination of clavamox and metronidazole can be considered as an alternative treatment for canine cyclosporiasis.",

Although all laboratory tests were negative for 8 canine viruses, 9 bacteria, and 5 other parasites, multiplex real-time PCR showed a positive reaction only for C. cayetanensis. Considering that the threshold cycle value of C. cayetanensis was as high as 28.8, C. cayetanensis was suspected to be responsible for the diarrhea.",
