Methods: We obtained and analyzed clinical, epidemiological and virological data from the three patients. RT-PCR, viral culture and sequencing were conducted for determination of causative pathogen. Results: The index case presented developed pneumonia with fever after exposure to chicken in a poultry farm. Case A presented pneumonia with high fever on day 3 after she shared a hospital room with the index case. Case B, the father of the index case, presented pneumonia with high fever on day 15 after he took care of the index case. H7N9 virus circulated in the local farm to which the index case was exposed. Full genomic sequence of virus showed 99.8-100% identity shared between the index case and case A or case B. Compared to the earliest virus of Anhui, a total of 29 amino acid variation sites were observed in the 8 segments.",

Studies have indicated that continuous amino acid substitutions occur during the circulation of the H7N9 virus. 6 The gene tuning may create opportunities for further adaptation and its potential to cause a pandemic. 6 Biological features showed that the virus can bind to both avian-type (a2,3-linked sialic acid) and human-type (a2,6-linked sialic acid) receptors. 7 A ferret model showed that the virus was efficiently transmitted through direct contact, but less efficiently by airborne exposure. 8 However, an individual study showed that an individual virus isolated from humans was highly transmissible in ferrets by respiratory droplet, 9 and a mouse model indicated that only the human H7N9 isolates were highly pathogenic in mice. 9 Hence, investigation of clusters of human H7N9 infection is critically important to understanding potential person-to-person transmission and monitoring for any changes in the fitness of viruses to infect humans.",

In this report, we identified a hospital cluster of H7N9 avian influenza infection in the fifth wave epidemic in the Anhui Province of China. In the cluster, a woman (case A) with COPD was infected by H7N9 virus when she shared a hospital room with an H7N9-infected patient (index case). Her hospital bed was close to the index case's bed in around 2 m without any PPE. The woman had no exposure history to poultry at least 2 weeks before illness onset. Epidemiology investigation suggested no H7N9 circulation in poultry close to her living place, and she had no direct contact with the index case. The genomic sequence showed that the virus isolated from sputum of the infected woman shared 100% identity with the virus isolated from throat swab of the index case. So it is the most possible that case A was infected by H7N9 virus through airborne transmission. During 2013-2017, total 14 H7N9 sary infections were reported with probable human-to-human transmission while were linked 4 to household exposures and 10 to exposures in healthcare settings. 12 However, there is no report of a confirmed hospital cluster of H7N9 infection except a possible or controversial hospital cluster in 2016. [13] [14] [15] This report confirmed that the virus infected case A through airborne transmission possibly in a shared hospital room. It suggested that early diagnosis as well as clinical isolation treatment is necessary for H7N9 patients, and rigorous use of PPE is necessary for close contacts as well.",

            "text": "Previous evidence has demonstrated that live bird markets are the most frequent sources of H7N9 infection, 17, 18 and the closure of live bird markets is effective at controlling human infection. 19, 20 In this study, rRT-PCR detection indicated that the virus circulated in local poultry farms. Epidemiological investigation suggested that a chicken farm was the infectious source of the index patient. Consistently, our previous study stated that poultry farms may be a source of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus reassortment and human infection. 21 The illness onset of the index patient started on days 2-6 of exposure to live chickens from a poultry farm, indicating that the incubation period was 2-6 days, similar to that stated in previous H7N9 or other avian influenza virus infection reports. 10, 19 Therefore, control of H7N9 in poultry farms is very important to minimize the threat of H7N9 viruses to humans, and rigorous use of PPE by persons managing live poultry on farms is necessary to reduce exposure to potentially hazardous infected poultry materials. 22 The 3 patients reported in this study showed variable clinical progress and features. Acute liver damage presented in the index case and case B, and acute kidney damage was also found in the index case in addition to failure of respiratory function in all 3 cases. The index case presented symptoms of hemoptoe, while all 3 patients had thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is seen in 73% of H7N9-infected cases in published reports. 10 However, the exact pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that induction of autoimmune thrombocytopenia due to atypical influenza might contribute to thrombocytopenia in H7N9 infection as observed in the case of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 23, 24 In addition, case A died on day 1 after high fever, although the 3 cases were treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. The rapid deterioration of the disease may be due to her coexisting COPD because coexisting medical condition was the only independent risk factor for the acute respiratory distress syndrome. 10 Delayed antiviral therapy may be associated with a long duration of illness (35 days) in the index case as suggested in published documents. 25, 26 In terms of etiology, our report showed that no significant mutation was observed to be associated with enhancing the transmission or increasing human adaption in the genomic sequence according to previous studies including receptor binding sites in the HA or NA genes, 27-30 enhancing replication ability-associated sites, [31] [32] [33] or enhancing pathogenic-associated sites. 34 However, etiological surveillance has shown that the virus has presented continuous mutations since emerging in 2013 6 , suggesting that the largest outbreak of wave V may be due to a constellation of genes rather than a single mutation. 35 In addition, genetic drift evolution of avian influenza virus has been associated with vaccination pressure. 36, 37 Circulation of new mutant stains may be raised in poultry when H7N9 vaccines started to be inoculated in poultry in China in June 2017. Therefore, continuous surveillance is necessary to monitor for any changes in the fitness of viruses to infect humans to minimize the threat of H7N9 viruses.",
