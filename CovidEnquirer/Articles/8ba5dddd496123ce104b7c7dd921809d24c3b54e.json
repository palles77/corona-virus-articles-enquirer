He also had chills and rigors, but there was no cough, sputum, dyspnea, or diarrhea. On examination, there were some crepitations in the right lung base. Because of his occupation, he made frequent travels to and stayed in southern China. There was no definite history of contact with SARS patients. He was admitted to the hospital after dialysis for the investigation of fever. Chest radiograph on admission showed right lower lobe consolidation ( Fig  1A) . His peripheral white cell count was 7 \u03eb 10 3 /L (7 \u03eb 10 9 /L) (normal range [NR], 4.0 to 10.8 \u03eb 10 3 /L [4.0 to 10.8 \u03eb 10 9 /L]), and his absolute lymphocyte count was 0.5 \u03eb 10 3 /L (0.5 \u03eb 10 9 /L) (NR, 1.3 to 3.6 \u03eb 10 3 /L [1.3 to 3.6 \u03eb 10 9 /L]).

He was initially suspected to have SARS because there was a cluster of cases in the territory and because of his contact in southern China. However, the rapid antigen test of his nasopharyngeal aspirate later revealed influenza A virus. Thus, the subsequent working diagnosis at that time was influenza, with possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia. He became afebrile with improving chest radiograph within 48 hours after treatment with cefotaxime, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir. He was discharged with a course of oral medication 4 days later.",

The serum CK level rose to 903 IU/L and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 351 IU/L (NR, 87 to 213 IU/L). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was normal at 14 IU/L (NR, \u03fd58 IU/L). A repeated chest radiograph showed increasing right lower lobe consolidation. Based on his clinical features and history of travel, he was considered to fulfill the case definition of SARS given by the World Health Organization (WHO). 6 Levofloxacin and cefotaxime were continued.

He required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. A repeat chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrate ( Fig 1B) . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a later stool sample identified the presence of SARS-associated coronavirus RNA. Paired serum subsequently also confirmed a 4-fold increase in the immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of SARS-associated coronavirus.

In the case series of our hospital , 1 most patients present with fever, rigor, myalgia, dizziness, and diarrhea. The majority had lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time, elevated D-dimer, CK, LDH, and ALT. 1 In general, our patient followed the typical 3-phase course of the illness: viral replicative phase, immune hyperactive phase, and then pulmonary destructive phase. 9 In the first phase, symptoms are similar to upper respiratory infection with fever and myalgia. The second phase, due to immune response, causes febrile illness and rapidly increasing pulmonary inflammation with dyspnea. Postinflammatory fibrosis occurs in the third phase. However, our patient had an unexpectedly prolonged course of illness. He required hospitalization for more than 2 months, as compared to the average hospital stay of 14 to 25 days for other SARS patients. 1 The pulmonary infiltrate in his chest radiograph resolved only slowly and remained obvious almost 2 months after his initial presentation (see Fig 1D) . Furthermore, PCR for SARS-associated coronavirus RNA was positive in his stool sample for almost 2 months. In other patients, the virus usually becomes undetectable in stool by week 5. It is postulated that renal failure patients cannot eliminate the SARS-associated coronavirus effectively because of their relatively depressed immunity. Similar observation has been described in other chronic viral infections of renal failure patients. 10 We believe our patient probably contracted the SARS coronavirus during his travel to and stay in mainland China. Retrospectively, he fulfilled the WHO case definition of SARS 6 during his first presentation. The influenza A virus isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirate probably represented either a false-positive result or a genuine concomitant influenza A infection, which was endemic during that season in Hong Kong. It is important to note that neither serologic test nor PCR for SARS-associated coronavirus RNA was available when the patient was first admitted. Our patient highlights the difficulty in the diagnosis of SARS, as well as the need to consider double pathology when the circumstances are suspicious.",

We have not tested for the presence of SARS-associated coronavirus in spent dialysate of our patient. Since coronavirus is approximately 50 nm in diameter, it should not pass through the conventional low-flux polysulfone membrane. However, the modern high-flux polysulfone dialyzer has a much larger pore size (for example, over 50% of the \u24242 microglobulin can be removed during a single session of dialysis 15 ), and its use should be under great caution.",

It is generally recommended that the dosage of ribavirin should be halved in patients with a glomerular filtration rate below 10 mL/min, and a supplemental dose should be administered after hemodialysis. 12 In fact, some studies found that it was necessary to reduce the dosage in order to maintain its plasma level 16 and to avoid significant hemolysis. 13, 14 We followed the recommended dosage regimen adjustment in our patient.",
