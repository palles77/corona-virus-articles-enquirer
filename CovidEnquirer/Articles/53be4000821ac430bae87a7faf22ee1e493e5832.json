Cardiac evaluation revealed severe systemic hypertension and severe concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. One month later the cat had a new episode of hindlimb paralysis with recurrent seizures, and died in status epilepticus. At necropsy examination, the coronary arteries, arcuate renal arteries and common iliac arteries showed marked thickening with nodules segmentally located along the vessels and consequent narrowing of the lumina. Histologically, acute and chronic inflammatory infiltration of the vascular walls was associated with necrosis of the muscular layer. Lesions were consistent with polyarteritis nodosa and involved the small, medium and large arteries of the heart, kidneys, small and large intestine, mesentery, liver and thyroid. Multifocal meningeal vasculitis associated with focal infarction of the frontal lobe and necrotizing vascular polyneuropathy were detected. Involvement of the central and peripheral nervous systems in polyarteritis nodosa is a novel finding in cats.",

In man, PAN triggered by virus infections such as with hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19 and hairy cell leukaemia has been described (Ishiguro and Kawashima, 2010; Forbess and Bannykh, 2015) . An immune-mediated mechanism in the development of vascular lesions is suspected (Cid et al., 1994; Forbess and Bannykh, 2015) due to the prevalence of macrophages and CD4 + T lymphocytes in inflammatory infiltrates and to the clinical response to immunosuppressive drugs (Eleftheriou et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2016; James et al., 2018) . In veterinary medicine, PAN has been described in blue foxes associated with encephalitozoonosis (Nordstoga and Westbye, 1976) , in lambs with sarcocystosis (Landsverk and Bratberg, 1979) and in sheep infected with ovine herpesvirus 2 (Pesavento et al., 2018) . A relationship with streptococcal infection has been suspected in pigs (Liu et al., 2005) . However, no infectious agents have been detected in most cases of PAN in animals (Carpenter et al., 1988; Snyder et al., 1995; Porter et al., 2003; Wessel et al., 2017) .",

During the last year, recurrent vomiting and diarrhoea were reported. The cat was vaccinated and there was no history of exposure to toxins. The cat was seronegative for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Toxoplasma gondii. On presentation, the cat was bright, alert and responsive, with a low body condition score (3/9). Cardiac auscultation revealed a systolic heart murmur (grade 3/6) with maximal intensity over the sternum and severe systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure 230 mm Hg; normal range 120e150 mm Hg). Echocardiography revealed severe concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with heterogeneous echogenicity of the myocardium, a left atrium of normal dimensions and a dynamic obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed chronic intestinal and pancreatic inflammation. Neurological examination was unremarkable. Complete blood count and coagulation profile were normal. Serum electrophoresis showed a moderate hyperproteinaemia (9 g/dl, reference interval 6e8 g/ dl) with alpha-2 hyperglobulinaemia. Serum cardiac troponin I was 0 ng/ml (reference interval 0e0.11 ng/ ml) and concentrations of cobalamin and folate were normal. Low urine specificity gravity (1.012; reference interval 1.035e1.060) was also detected. After these diagnostic investigations, the cat was discharged on amlodipine 0.2 mg/kg q24h for systemic hypertension, clopidogrel 1 mg/kg q24h as an antithrombotic drug, probiotics (feline Fortiflora \u00d2 ProPlan \u00d2 Veterinary Diets; Nestl e Purina, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and a gastrointestinal diet (feline EN Gastro-intestinal\u00d4 Pro Plan \u00d2 Veterinary Diets; Nestl e Purina). After 1 week of therapy, the cat appeared to have improved clinically, but the systolic blood pressure was still high, and the dose of amlodipine was increased to 0.2 mg/kg q12h. One month later the cat was readmitted with a new episode of hindlimb paralysis with bilateral loss of patellar reflex and reduced nociception. The cat also showed circling, vocalization and recurrent seizures. The cat died in status epilepticus on the same day.",

In the small and large intestine, arterial vessels of the external and internal muscular layers were mainly affected. In the CNS, both the dura mater and leptomeninges were involved, with scattered vascular lesions, mainly located in the spinal cord and ventral aspect of the thalamus, midbrain, medulla oblongata and frontal lobes. Lesions were accompanied by scattered inflammatory cells in the meninges and a focal infarct in the ventral frontal cortex. This latter lesion was associated with affected vessels of the meninges and was characterized by malacia and white matter degeneration, gliosis and infiltration of macrophages laden with haemosiderin. Both ulnar and common peroneal nerves showed different stages of inflammation of epineural small and medium arteries, ranging from mild perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration to severe thickening of the intima and tunica media with destruction of the elastic lamina ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Vascular lesions were associated with axonal degeneration and a slight loss of large and medium myelinated fibres of nerve fascicles. In muscle samples, there was moderate variation in muscle fibre size and shape, mainly in the cranial tibial muscle, in which there were many angular or rounded atrophic fibres and rare hypertrophic fibres. Rounded atrophic fibres were frequently observed at the periphery of muscle fascicles. No fibrosis or inflammatory infiltrates were observed in the muscle samples. Myofibre type distribution and enzymatic oxidative pattern were normal. No lesions were observed in the lungs and no intralesional bacteria, protozoa or fungi were identified in any tissues. Immunolabelling for FIP coronavirus antigen was negative in all tissues.",

A cellmediated immune mechanism was suspected, similar to that described in man (Cid et al., 1994) .

Indeed, the observed lesions could result from a progression of immune mechanisms from type III to type IV hypersensitivity. Prolonged inflammatory vascular injury stimulates proliferation of smooth muscle cells, deposits of extracellular matrix and fibroblast growth with progressive intimal and medial thickening and narrowing of the vascular lumen (Schoen, 2005) .

            "text": "The clinical signs of neurological, cardiac and renal dysfunction shown by the present cat were a consequence of vascular damage and related vascular hypoxia. Left ventricular concentric hypertrophy with heterogeneous echogenicity of the myocardium was assumed to be a consequence of chronic systemic hypertension, severe vascular inflammatory lesions and myocardial fibrosis (Abbott, 2010) . Although PAN involving the coronary arteries, with subsequent myocardial infarction, has been described in man and dogs (Carpenter et al., 1988; Odhav et al., 1994; Yuce et al., 2011) , no clinical signs of acute coronary syndrome were identified, and no haemorrhages or infarcts were detected on post-mortem examination in the present case. Central neurological signs, such as circling and seizures, were likely due to involvement of the meningeal vessels and the presence of cerebral infarction as described in sows and dogs with PAN (Carpenter et al., 1988; Liu et al., 2005) . The present cat also showed hindlimb paralysis subsequent to necrotizing vascular neuropathy. Nerve fibre degeneration was secondary to ischaemia due to vasculitis of the vasa nervorum. In cats, hindlimb paralysis with decreased peripheral pulse pressure, pallor and coolness frequently results from aortic thromboembolism secondary to underlying cardiac disease, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but has also been observed in peripheral arterial neoplasia or foreign body embolization (Dickinson and LeCouteur, 2004) . Necrotizing vascular neuropathies secondary to PAN are common in man (Imboden, 2017; James et al., 2018) , but have not been described in veterinary medicine. Peripheral nerve involvement was associated with neurogenic muscle atrophy and primary myopathic findings, such as perifascicular atrophy, were suggestive of ischaemic myopathy.",
