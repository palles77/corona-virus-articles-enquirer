However, there is currently no scientific data linking the recreational trail horse to the incidence or increased risk of human cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis. This survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. in recreational horses utilizing trails located near large watershed areas in Colorado.

Cryptosporidia is much more prevalent within the first two months of the foal's life but has been identified in the feces of adult horses, older foals, weanlings, and yearlings, a Infected horses may appear normal, but infection in foals can result in diarrhea and malabsorption of the absorptive surface in the small intestine. In some cases, infection progresses rapidly and can result in death within two weeks of onset of clinical symptoms. 3,4,5,6 Giardia has also been identified in the feces of adult horses, yearlings, weanlings, and foals. 7 The broad host range, coupled with the resistant nature and small size of these parasites in the environment may potentially contribute to environmental contamination and waterborne transmission. Oocysts and cysts are present in much of the surface water and their concentration may be increased after heavy rainfall due to an increased runoff of wild and domestic animal wastes, a Both of these parasites produce resistant stages which are not easily destroyed by chlorination and can escape routine water filtering and treatment processes. In 1993, an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis affected people in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area. An estimated 400,000 people were infected and there were 100 deaths attributed to infection with Cryptosporidia sp. Since",

These prevalence results are consistent with the Cryptosporidium/Giardia Study conducted in California/ Detailed information on the positive Cryptosporidium horse. Only a single oocyst was detected in the fecal sample from this horse, suggesting that potentially the oocyst was ingested and then expelled without undergoing development within the microvillous border of the intestine of this horse. Three months after the initial laboratory detection of the Cryptosporidia oocyst, another fresh fecal sample was obtained from this same horse and retested for Cryptosporidium and Giardia using the same procedure. Results from the second Merifluor TM Direct Immunofluorescent Detection Procedure indicated that the horse was negative for both Cryptosporidium and Giardia. An aerobic fecal culture on the second sample indicated normal flora growth and the EM Scan/Elisa test was negative; in addition, no Salmonella was detected.
