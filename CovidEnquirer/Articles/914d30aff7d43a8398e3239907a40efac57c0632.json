The aim of this study was to identify influenza-specific factors associated with ICU admission and mortality. Furthermore, influenza-specific pulmonary bacterial, fungal and viral co-infections were investigated. Methods: 199 influenza patients, admitted to two academic hospitals in the Netherlands between 01-10-2015 and 01-04-2016 were investigated of which 45/199 were admitted to the ICU. Results: A history of Obstructive/Central Sleep Apnea Syndrome, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, influenza type A, BMI N 30, the development of renal failure and bacterial and fungal co-infections, were observed more frequently in patients who were admitted to the ICU, compared with patients at the normal ward. Co-infections were evident in 55.6% of ICU-admitted patients, compared with 20.1% of patients at the normal ward, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Non-survivors suffered from diabetes mellitus and (pre-existent) renal failure more often. Conclusions: The current study indicates that a history of OSAS/CSAS, myocardial infarction and BMI N 30 might be related to ICU admission in influenza patients. Second, ICU patients develop more pulmonary co-infections. Last, (pre-existent) renal failure and diabetes mellitus are more often observed in non-survivors.",

            "text": "Influenza virus infection is an important cause of mortality worldwide, leading to 250.000-500.000 deaths each year in the developed world [1] . While most influenza patients have a self-limited respiratory illness, 5-10% of hospitalized patients may develop severe dyspnea or respiratory distress requiring ICU admission [2] . Mortality is caused by the primary viral infection which can have a fulminant disease course [3] , but also by influenza-associated pulmonary co-infections [4, 5] . It is increasingly recognized that similar to sepsis, influenza can initiate immunosuppressive mechanisms [5, 6] , creating an ideal environment for opportunistic pathogens to grow out and induce co-infections. Pulmonary bacterial co-infections are predominantly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae [5] . Also, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) caused by the fungal Aspergillus fumigatus is recently recognized as a co-infection occurring in 20-25% of influenza patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [7, 8] . Both bacterial as well as fungal pulmonary co-infections are associated with increased mortality rates [7, [9] [10] [11] . In addition, viral co-infections [12] and reactivation of viruses that reside latent in the host, such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein barr virus (EBV) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV) are frequently encountered in influenza patients as well [4, 13] . Whether these infections are associated with increased mortality or merely reflect a manifestation of immunosuppression is not elucidated yet.",

The influenza epidemic of 2015-2016 started on November 1st 2015 and ended on May 1st 2016 according to the National Institute for Health and the Environment (RIVM Rapport 2016-0071). Patients who were admitted to the participating hospitals between October 1st 015 and April 1st 2016 were checked for eligibility for the study. Cases were identified using a database of the microbiology departments at both medical centers. Patients who were admitted to the hospital with clinical symptoms due to an acute infection with Influenza A or B were included. Virus samples were obtained from nose/throat swabs, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The laboratory of microbiology of both hospitals confirmed a novel influenza infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Diagenode, Belgium) for either influenza A (H1N1 / H2N3) or influenza B [14] . No distinction was made between self-referral, scheduled admission or emergency hospital admission. Patients who were initially admitted to regional hospitals before admittance to one of the university medical centers were included if they met the case definition and had not received antibiotic or antiviral treatments before admission. Patients with a positive influenza PCR who were already admitted to the hospital were excluded from the study if the sample was collected as part of a routine screening and no prior symptoms of infection were observed. The initial day of hospital admission was defined as day 0.",

Similar to previous seasons, our data indicate that pre-existing respiratory disease is associated with ICU admission in the 2015-2016 influenza season [20] . From our database, dyspnea appeared to be the most determinative clinical sign for influenza-associated ICU admission. Also, OSAS/CSAS could be a new independent factor related to ICU admission, although the total numbers of patients in this group was only 9. Possibly, a decreased breathing quality weakens pulmonary function in OSAS/CSAS patients and thereby increases the risk for ICU admission. Other mechanisms may influence pulmonary function as well, such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, vascular endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress as described as OSAS/ CSAS-related (cardiovascular) complications [21] .",

            "text": "The number of patients in our cohort with influenza A virus infections was substantially higher than the number of patients with influenza B virus infections, which is usually the case in influenza epidemics [22] . H1N1 was most prevalent in our study cohort, which is representative for the global prevalence of this subtype in the community during the 2015-2016 influenza season [22] . In our study, patients with influenza type A were admitted more often to the ICU than patients with subtype B, probably due to H1N1 being the most prevalent circulating subtype during this season. In addition, H1N1 is associated with a more severe disease course and higher mortality rates, compared with influenza B and other influenza A subtypes like H3N2, being less virulent [22] . In the current study, 23% of hospitalized influenza patients were admitted to the ICU, which is more than the 5-10% described in literature [2] . This could be due to selection of the patients, composed from a database of two tertiary centers in the Netherlands which overall represent the most severely ill and therefore logically associated with an increased number of ICU admissions. The ICU population was treated more often with oseltamivir in comparison with patients at the normal ward. Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that blocks the viral neuraminidase, an enzyme that is essential for the release of newly formed virions from the host cells. A Cochrane analysis concluded that oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 h, but had no effect on hospitalization risk [23] . Oseltamivir had no effects on mortality among patients with type A/H1N1 influenza during the 2009 pandemic [24] . In our study, oseltamivir was administered to every influenza patient upon admission, except when clinical symptoms were prevalent N5 days, most likely reflecting a less severe influenza disease course in these patients. The increased use of oseltamivir in patients admitted to the ICU is therefore more likely due to selection bias, and not a true risk factor for ICU admission. Also, an increasing trend for ICU mortality was observed for the systemic use of steroids and non-steroid immunosuppressive drugs before hospitalization. The latter suggests that an immunosuppressive state, caused by (pre-existent) immunomodulatory therapy or as a direct result of influenza infection leading to increased susceptibility towards secondary infections, might influence the disease course and prognosis of influenza infection. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for a complicated disease course.",

As expected, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia were the most common bacterial pathogens determined, prevalent in respectively 11% and 7% of influenza patients at the ICU, causing a transition from normal colonization of the upper respiratory tract to infectious disease [5, 25] . Influenza predisposes to secondary infections by direct effects, including the disruption of epithelial cell barriers and suppression of the production of antibacterial peptides and upregulation of bacterial adhesion molecules [1, 26, 27] , but also by indirect immunomodulatory effects, such as impairing antigen presenting capacity in the draining lymph nodes [27, 28] and altered expression of costimulatory molecules and cell surface receptors [5, 27, 28] . The high incidence of fungal coinfections in the subgroup of ICU patients, in particular caused by Aspergillus fumigatus (18%) is in line with previous reports, showing that the pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is observed in 20-25% of influenza patients [7, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The high incidence of co-infections caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus fumigatus indicates that a specific immune defect could be present in influenza patients, increasing the susceptibility towards these pathogens, which is currently under investigation [35] . Our data indicates that although pulmonary co-infections are more often observed in ICU patients, compared with patients at the normal ward, this is not necessarily associated with increased mortality. The majority of previous studies illustrate increased mortality resulting from infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus spp. following influenza infection [4, 36, 37] . Possibly, the increased mortality could not be demonstrated due to the low number of patients in the current study. Of note, we cannot exclude that the high incidence of pulmonary fungal and bacterial co-infections in the current study is related to selection bias, because both selected hospitals for this study are tertiary hospitals, generally receiving the most severely ill influenza patients.",

These relatively high mortality rates may be attributed to the influenza virus itself. However, the 2015-2016 seasonal influenza epidemic in the Netherlands did not result in increased mortality compared with previous seasonal outbreaks (RIVM, Rapport 2016-0071). More likely, this high in-hospital and ICUassociated mortality is a reflection of the referral function of a university medical center.",

Also, the method of analyses could have influenced the data. In the current study, we used the Frequentist interpretation that views probability as the limit of the relative frequency of an event after a large number of trials. This instead of for example the Bayesian approach in which the conditional probability of an event based on data as well as prior information about the event or conditions related to the event is taken into account. All factors above have influenced the scientific impact of the data. However, even with the limited number of study subjects, independent risk factors and several statistical significant relationships were identified using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. However, complications logically occur in the most severely ill and one could suggest that these factors would therefore merely reflect disease severity than being true risk factors. Nevertheless, despite the limited validity due to large spreading and small sample sizes, the identified factors may contribute to a complicated disease course and could represent a tool for early recognition of the influenza patients at risk for a complicated disease course.",

Also, pulmonary coinfections were observed more often in ICU patients, mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus.

Respiratory failure was the main indication for ICU admission: 40 patients received Characteristics of patients with influenza virus infection admitted to the hospital. Patients who died suffered more often from diabetes mellitus (OR 7.09, CI 95% 1.23-40.75; p = .04). Renal failure was a risk factor for mortality both present before or during ICU admission (OR 6.815, CI 95% 1.47-31.61; p = .01 and OR 8.13, CI 95% 2.03-32.57; p = .002 respectively). The use of immunosuppressive drugs (systemic steroids and non-steroids) before hospitalization showed a trend towards increased ICU mortality (OR 3.57, CI 95% 1.01-12.68; p = .06 and OR 4.54, CI 95% 0.96-21.56; p = .06).",
