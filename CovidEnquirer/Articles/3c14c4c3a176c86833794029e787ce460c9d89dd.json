            "text": "Although bats are increasingly becoming the focus of scientific studies due to their unique properties, these exceptional animals are still among the least studied mammals. Assembly quality and completeness of bat genomes vary a lot and especially non-coding RNA (ncRNA) annotations are incomplete or simply missing. Accordingly, standard bioinformatics pipelines for gene expression analysis often ignore ncRNAs such as microRNAs or long antisense RNAs. The main cause of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotations. We present a complete screening for ncRNAs within 16 bat genomes. NcRNAs affect a remarkable variety of vital biological functions, including gene expression regulation, RNA processing, RNA interference and, as recently described, regulatory processes in viral infections. Within all investigated bat assemblies we annotated 667 ncRNA families including 162 snoRNAs and 193 miRNAs as well as rRNAs, tRNAs, several snRNAs and lncRNAs, and other structural ncRNA elements. We validated our ncRNA candidates by six RNA-Seq data sets and show significant expression patterns that have never been described before in a bat species on such a large scale. Our annotations will be usable as a resource (Electronic Supplement) for deeper studying of bat evolution, ncRNAs repertoire, gene expression and regulation, ecology, and important host-virus interactions.",

Possibly, the solution to better understand and fight these pathogens lies in the uniquely developed immune system of bats. 15, 16 . Studying bats and their genomes is likely to have high impacts on various scientific fields, including healthy ageing, immune and ecosystem functioning, the evolution of sensory perception and human communication, and mammalian genome architecture (see the recent Bat1K review for further details 2 ). Despite the unique biological characteristics of these flying mammals and their important role as natural reservoirs for viruses, bats are one of the least studied taxa of all mammalian 17 . Accordingly, there is little knowledge about the non-protein-coding transcriptome of bats, which plays a crucial role in an extensive number of cellular and regular functions and comprises a very diverse family of untranslated RNA molecules 18, 19 . In addition, it is believed that due to the early evolutionary radiation of bats (compared to other mammals) their innate and acquired immune responses have a different set of molecules 1 .",

We used the Gorap pipeline (https://github.com/koriege/gorap), a specially developed software suite for genomewide ncRNA screening. Gorap screens genomic sequences for all ncRNAs present in the Rfam database using a generalized strategy by applying multiple filters and specialized software tools. To this end, Gorap takes huge advantage of Infernal (v1.1.2) 49,50 to annotate ncRNAs based on input alignment files conserved in sequence and secondary structure (so-called Stockholm alignment files; stk). All resulting alignment files were automatically pre-filtered by Gorap based on different ncRNA class-specific parameters including taxonomy, secondary structure, and primary sequence comparisons. Due to repeats, pseudogenes, undiscriminable un-/functional genes, and overlapping results from the different assembly methods, we defined a ncRNA set per species for annotation that includes filtered sequences, but allows for variants and multiple copies. This final annotation set is defined by hand-curating the resulting stk alignments of Gorap with the help of Emacs RALEE mode 51 . Due to the removal of sequences in the stockholm alignments, the remaining sequences were extracted and again aligned into stockholm format using cmalign -noprob from Infernal. The Rfamderived ncRNA alignments were further split into snoRNAs (Tab. S5), miRNAs (Tab. S6), and other ncRNAs including snRNAs, lncRNAs, and other structural RNAs (Tab. S8).",

For reference mapping, Huang et al. also used the M. lucifugus genome, so we were theoretically able to directly compare our annotations with the annotations of both studies. Unfortunately, no positional information (annotation file) of the identified miRNAs derived from the transcriptomic data of M. myotis were given in the manuscript or supplement 8 . Therefore, we blasted the precursor miRNA sequences identified with the help of the M. myotis transcriptome against the M. lucifugus genome and retained only hits with a sequence identity of 100 %. The so obtained positional information was further used to calculate the overlap between our predicted miRNAs in M. lucifugus. We used the same approach for the P. alecto comparison.

The transcripts were used as input for a BLASTn (2.7.1+, 1e \u221210 ) search against each of the 16 bat assemblies (compiled as BLAST databases). The BLASTn result for each bat assembly was further processed to group single hits into potential transcripts as follows: first, for each query sequence q \u2208 H, hits of q found on the same contig c and strand s were selected (hits c,s,q ) and the longest one, q 1 , was chosen as a starting point, so that trscp c,s,q = (q 1 ). Second, all hits q i \u2208 hits c,s,q with q i / \u2208 trscp c,s,q , that do not overlap neither in the query q nor in the target sequence and do not exceed a maximum range of 500,000 nt from the most up-stream to the most down-stream target sequence position of all q j \u2208 trscp c,s,q \u222a q i , were added iteratively to trscp c,s,q . To this end, we introduced a simple model of exon-intron structures, naturally occurring when using transcript sequences as queries against a target genome assembly. We defined the 500,000 nt search range based on an estimation of lncRNA gene sizes derived from the human Ensembl 45 annotation. If the sum of the lengths of all q i \u2208 trscp c,s,q covers the query transcript length length q at least for 70 %, trscp c,s,q was considered as a transcript and its elements q i as exons, otherwise all q i \u2208 trscp c,s,q were withdrawn. This procedure is repeated until all hits \u2208 hits c,s,q were used or withdrawn. Therefore, each so-defined group of non-overlapping hits derived from the same query sequence and found on the same contig and strand should represent a lncRNA transcript with its (rough) exon structure. The defined transcripts were saved as BLAST-like output and transformed into GTF file format. To follow the GTF annotation format and to harmonize our lncRNA annotations with the other ncRNA annotations, each lncRNA transcript was also saved as a gene annotation and consists of at least one exon.",

Accordingly, the available bat genome annotations vary a lot regarding their quality, ranging from more comprehensive annotations for long-standing bat genomes such as M. lucifugus or P. vampyrus to annotations on region level, completely missing any coding or noncoding gene annotations at the current NCBI The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/738526 doi: bioRxiv preprint version ( Fig. 3 and Tab. 4). Furthermore, and by using strand-specific RNA-Seq data, we could show that some genes (e.g. IFNA5/IFNW2 in the Ensembl annotation of M. lucifugus 36 ) are annotated on the false strand and are therefore entirely missed by differential expression studies when relying on a strand-specific read quantification. For all publicly available bat genomes, ncRNAs are generally annotated on low levels and are highly incomplete, mostly only comprising some tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, and lncRNAs ( Fig. 3 and Tab. 4) . Therefore, many ncRNAs, especially miRNAs, are simply overlooked by current molecular studies, for example from RNA-Seq studies that aim to call differential expressed genes based on such in-complete genome annotation files. Studies that have made additional effort on annotating ncRNAs in bats 8, 33, 55, 61, 62 are not reporting their results on a level that can be directly used for further computational assessment (e.g. as an direct input for RNA-Seq abundance estimation). Currently, in the NCBI database, five bat assemblies are entirely lacking any coding/non-coding annotations and miRNAs are not annotated at all (Tab. 4). The Rfam database 47 contains mainly for M. lucifugus and P. vampyrus 336 ncRNA families. Other ncRNAs are currently unknown from bat genomes or not well documented.",

S1. Accordingly, also the annotation status varies a lot (Tab. 4). Within this work, we give an overview of potential ncRNA annotations in bats. However, the precise number of ncRNAs remains unclear, because of ncRNAs being present several times in the assemblies, and others still remaining undiscovered. To give a better estimation of transcribed and potentially functional ncRNAs, we used six Illumina short-read RNA-Seq data sets derived from four bat species (Tab. 2) to estimate the expression levels of our novel annotations. Note that we refer throughout this paper to an RNA-Seq data set by the first author's name and the year of the respective data set publication. The only included data set derived from a species of the Yinpterochiroptera suborder (R. aegyptiacus) was obtained from a study dealing with the differential transcriptional responses of Ebola and Marburg virus infections in human and bat cells 16 (data set: H\u00f6lzer-2016). In this study, total RNA of nine samples of R06E-J cells, either challenged by the Ebola or Marburg virus or left un-infected, were harvested at 3, 7, or 23 h post infection (poi) and sequenced. Unfortunately, no biological replicates could be generated for this study. Therefore, we did not use this data set for the differential expression analysis, but also Finally, we used data of the long-fingered bat M. natalensis initially obtained to characterize the developing bat wing 33 . Here, total RNA was extracted from paired forelimbs and hindlimbs from three individuals at three developmental stage.",

For SNORA38, PVT1_5 and HOTTIP_2 and 3 we additionally found sophisticated differential expression patterns in at least one of the used RNA-Seq data sets (absolute log2 fold-change greater 1, TPM> 10). For all bat species we observed various numbers of tRNAs (Tab. 5 and Tab. S4). We could detect full sets of tRNAs for E. fuscus and M. davidii, whereas between one and four tRNAs are missing from the assemblies of H. armiger, M. brandtii, M. lucifugus, M. lyra, M. natalensis, P. parnellii, R. ferrumequinum, R. sinicus, and D. rotundus and between nine and twelve are missing for E. helvum, P. alecto, P. vampyrus, R. aegyptiacus, and E. spelaea (Tab. S4). Interestingly, we identified a large number of tRNAs (18, 235) for M. lyra in comparison to all other bat species (Tab. S4), likely a result of the low assembly quality (Fig. 2, Tab. S1 ). The lowest amount of tRNAs was annotated for P. parnellii and D. rotundus with only 1,059 and 1,041 copies, respectively. In all other bat genomes we found between 1,735 and 4,657 tRNA genes (Tab. S4). The tRNA encoding for valine (Val) with the anticodon structure TAC had high copy numbers (over 1,000) in all genome assemblies of the Pteropodidae family (Tab. 5). Similar copy numbers were achieved by the R. ferrumequinum and R. sinicus assemblies regarding the tRNA encoding for isoleucine (Ile) with the anticodon AAT (Tab. S4). For tRNA(Ile) and the anticodon GAT we also observed high copy numbers in H. armiger. Interestingly, all species with high tRNA(Val) and tRNA(Ile) copy numbers had rather low counts (between 0 and 28) of tRNA(SeC) with the anticodon TCA, while this tRNA was found with higher copy numbers in P. parnelli (68) and in D. rotundus (145) and with even higher counts (between 315-498) in all other bat species (Tab. S4). However, high copy numbers might be also occur due to assembly quality and false positive predictions of tRNAscan-SE.",

Many snoRNAs were found with exactly one copy present in each bat genome assembly (e.g. SCARNA7), whereas others were found in multiple copies for each bat species (e.g. SNORD112) or completely absent from certain bat families (e.g. ACA64), see Tab. 5. Exactly one copy of the small nucleolar RNA ACA64 was found within the genomes of the Pteropodidae family and multiple copies for D. rotundus, P. parnellii, M. natalensis and members of the Vespertilionidae family, however, this snoRNA seems to be completely absent from bat species of the Megadermatidae and Rhinolophidae families (Tab. 5). The H/ACA box snoRNA ACA64 is predicted to guide the pseudo-uridylation of 28S rRNA U4331 63 .

In general, replicates of virus-infected and IFN-treated samples 24 h post infection tend to cluster together only based on the expression profiles of small ncRNAs (mainly miRNAs) ( Fig. 4A and B ). Most differences can be observed between the 24 h virus-infected and all other samples, that seem to show no clearly distinguishable expression pattern. Interestingly, at 6 h post infection, we see replicates clustering together regardless of their treatment (mock, IFN, Clone 13). Thus, after only 6 h, few miRNAs are differentially expressed and therefore the samples of each replicate (mock, IFN, Clone 13) cluster together, because they have the same passaging history but the passaging history in between the replicates differ 36 . After 24 h, more and more miRNAs are significantly differentially expressed and the samples can be better distinguished based on their treatment ( Fig. 4A and B) . We observed that, in general, miRNAs tend to be down-regulated (Fig 4B; upper half) , while snoRNAs tend to be up-regulated (lower half) after 24 h of Clone 13 infection compared to mock. For example, we found a novel miRNA (MLUGD00000002094 in our annotation; predicted by mirDeep2; Tab. S7) located in an intron of the protein-coding gene SEMA3G, significantly down-regulated (log 2 fc=-2.56) during Clone 13 infection (Fig. 4C and D) . Based on Rfam alignments we further found a histone 3'-UTR stem-loop (RF00032), an RNA element involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of the histone mRNAs, significantly down-regulated during infection. For the same comparison of mock and virus-infected samples at 24 h, the rRNAdepleted data set (H\u00f6lzer-2019) revealed several DE lncRNAs. For example, we found a lncRNA potentially transcribed in an intron of MX1 (MLUGL00000039178) up-regulated (log 2 fc=3.36) during infection. Another lncRNA (MLUGL00000087396), we found potentially transcribed as a part of two exons of the PLAT protein-coding gene and down-regulated (log 2 fc = -1.67) during viral infection (see details in Files S2.11).",

We provide novel annotations in the common GTF format, following a hierarchical structure of gene, transcript, and exon features to allow direct integration of our annotations into already available ones (Tab. S3-S10). Finally, we provide for each bat genome assembly an extended annotation file merged with the protein-and non-coding gene annotations that were already available by the NCBI database (Files S1; leaving out potential lncRNAs that can be downloaded separately, see Tab. S9). We used six RNA-Seq data sets derived from the transcriptomic sequencing of four bat species (Tab. 2) to calculate normalized expression values for our newly annotated ncRNAs and exemplarily show significantly differential expressed ncRNAs (Fig. 4) , that were never before described on such a large scale for any bat species. In addition to the evolutionarily explainable differences in the pure existence and the amount of annotated ncRNAs in bats, we have observed that the assembly quality can also influence the annotation results.

We aim to extend our annotation of ncRNAs regulary and whenever new bat genomes become publicly available.

(B) A heat map and hirarchical clustering for the same 150 most highly expressed ncRNAs that were used for PCA (A). The clustering was performed on DESeq2-normalized read counts and scaled on rows to visualize changes in expression on ncRNA level. Most differences can be observed between the Clone 13-infected samples 24 h post infection and all other conditions. Due to minor changes in miRNA expression levels, the other samples tend to cluster on the basis of their passaging history and not on the basis of their treatment. In general, miRNAs tend to be down-regulated (upper half), while snoRNAs tend to be up-regulated (lower half) after 24 h of Clone 13 infection.
