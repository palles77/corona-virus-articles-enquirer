A panel data set of large-scale housing complexes (estates) is used to exploit the cross-sectional variation in the spread of SARS to estimate the effect of the disease on real estate prices and sales. SARS risk is measured by: (1) the estate-level SARS infection rate, (2) news reports, and (3) government announcements of infections. The average price declines by 1-3 percent if an estate is directly affected by SARS, and by 1.6 percent for all estates as a result of the outbreak of the disease. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of the expected price fall under the rational asset-pricing model implies that the economic value of life consistent with the SARS-related price movement was less than $1 million. This low figure contrasts with the predictions of overreaction from psychological and behavioral economics theories. An analysis of transaction volume suggests that the absence of price overreaction is likely to be related to housing market characteristics, including transaction costs, credit constraints and loss aversion.",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is the first new, serious and contagious illness of the 21st century. Three hundred Hong Kong residents died during the 2003 SARS epidemic (March-June), accounting for a third of all SARS deaths worldwide. The risk of contracting SARS in Hong Kong during the epidemic was 0.026 percent. This apparent vulnerability raises the possibility that Hong Kong has since been perceived as a less desirable place in which to work and live. 1 Coincident with the unanticipated epidemic, housing prices in Hong Kong fell by 8 percent. Is this dramatic price decline-representing a total value of $28 billion, equal to about $16 million per SARS case-a continuation of the pre-SARS downward trend, or a response to the epidemic? 2, 3 This paper attempts to answer this question. Firstly, the extent to which the drop in housing prices can be attributed to the SARS epidemic is estimated. A unique panel data set of weekly transaction prices of 44 housing complexes (estates) is used to estimate the effect of SARS on the housing market, exploiting the cross-sectional variation in the timing and spread of SARS within Hong Kong. The perceived location-specific risk is measured by analyzing all major sources of public information related to the 44 estates. A best estimate of the estate-level SARS infection rates is also created. 4 Next, we investigate whether the drop in prices can be characterized as an overreaction, as compared with the predictions of the standard asset pricing model [12] . To better understand the price movements, a similar analysis is performed for turnover rates in the housing market.",

Cross-sectional differences in price changes come from variations in the spread of SARS, but this misses the Hong Kong-wide effect.

Unlike other exogenous extreme events that have previously been studied (e.g., flooding), the 2003 epidemic involves a clear change in risk level. A growing body of research points to social amplification of risks when they 1 Hong Kong was the most severely hit city in the world in the 2003 SARS epidemic, accounting for 21 percent of all SARS cases and 33 percent of SARS deaths. 2 The value of private housing stock is evaluated using year-end 2002 prices. Source: Hong Kong Housing Authority http://www.housingauthority.gov.hk/hdw/ihc/pdf/bhfs.pdf. 3 Many related the housing price decline in the second quarter of 2003 to the SARS epidemic. David Carse, the Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, attributed the sharp increase in negative equity loans (by HKD 30 billion, or 22 percent) to the acceleration of the housing price decline due to SARS (http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/eng/press/2003/20030814e4.htm). DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, a prominent property consultancy, claimed that SARS had a \"devastating impact\" on the Hong Kong housing market shortly after the outbreak started. 4 The main information sources include the daily Department of Health SARS-building list (the only form of government announcement related to SARS cases in specific buildings), and local newspaper reports. There is no record of the SARS infection rate in different parts of Hong Kong below the district level. (Hong Kong consists of 18 districts. See Section 4 for details.) involve unknown and dreaded events beyond the control of the individual, causing rippling effects much greater than the direct impacts, and reaching far beyond the direct victims. 5 Economists have also long observed that societal responses to health risks tend to be extreme and inconsistent, suggesting an overestimation of the frequency of rare risks [17, 18] . This tendency to overreact to new risk may be offset in this case, however, because there is reason to believe that cognitive errors in judgment are less likely when the costs to the decision maker are high [5] . Housing sale prices are likely to have a significant impact on household wealth positions, especially for leveraged households. Thus, the SARS epidemic provides an interesting example to evaluate the significance of information in markets. This paper provides an indirect measurement of the marginal household's evaluation of the SARS risk, by estimating the compensating differential for greater SARS risk in the housing market [13] . 6 Given the low turnover rate in housing markets as compared to other asset markets, measurement errors make it difficult to test precisely when new information has an impact. Consequently, the focus is on the \"medium-run\" impact of the various indicators over a period of 38 weeks, 13 during the epidemic and 25 after, which is relevant to most households given the long holding period of housing units. 7 It is worth pointing out that the measured compensating differentials reflect not only the economic value of life and the SARS risk, but also the perceived permanence of the risk and the disutility related to nonfatal SARS cases. Because we have no direct measurement of the perceived persistence of the epidemic or the disutility of non-fatal incidents of the disease, instead of a point estimate, a range of estimates of the marginal willingness-to-pay to avoid the risk of the epidemic is presented.",

A Hong Kong-wide price decrease of 1.6 percent above the preceding trend is identified after the start of the epidemic for all housing estates, as well as an additional decrease of less than 3 percent for the average SARS-affected estate, i.e., those that were publicly known to have had SARS cases or were mentioned in the newspapers in relation to SARS. The implied economic value of life, from $121,000 to just over $1 million, falls towards the lower end of the range based on studies of less extreme risks. Although the nature of the SARS risk limits the extent to which this value of life estimate can be generalized, it helps put the SARS-related price decline in perspective.

A significant negative price reaction in response to the estimated infection rate is identified, although no direct measure of the estate-level SARS risk was publicly available.

However, public exposure through the government SARS-list did not have sim- 5 For example, see [1, 15] . 6 Because the SARS epidemic was unexpected, pre-sorting of households into different housing locations according to their valuation of the risk is less likely. 7 Another difficulty arises because asset prices react to the difference between the prior expectation and the realization of announcements, and we have no information for the former. The \"news\" component in an announcement can be denoted as n = (V \u2212 E)/\u03c3 , where V stands for the realized value of an economic variable, E a surveyed expectation prior to the announcement, and \u03c3 the sample standard deviation of (V \u2212 E). An overly pessimistic view of the future on a previous day will make today's market response to unfavorable announcements seem tame. This paper abstracts from short-run price movements. ilar effects. 8 Price reactions towards all SARS indicators are small, however, providing little evidence for a magnification of noises in public information [11] . Several explanations for the lack of observed price overreactions are examined through a similar analysis of transaction volumes. Measurement errors in the SARS risk indicators attenuate coefficient estimates in the price regressions, but the significant decreases in turnover rates identified suggest that this does not drive the price results. 9 A \"wait-and-see\" attitude, driven by either liquidity constraints [16] or loss aversion [4] , implies a decline in volume and an attenuation of negative price reactions. Evidence for this phenomenon is found in the significant turnover rate declines associated with appearance on the SARS-list and the Chinese news indicators, to which there is a lack of related price responses. 10 The following section provides a chronology of the 2003 epidemic. Section 3 then discusses the related literature, Section 4 describes the data, Section 5 reports the empirical findings, and Section 6 offers conclusions. Figure 1 shows a timeline of the 2003 epidemic. Several events are particularly relevant for this study. The time lag between the occurrence of the first case in February and the government confirmation of the community spread of SARS on March 26 highlights the difficulty in pinning down the start date of the epidemic. 11 March 26, 2003 is adopted as the start date, as this marks the point at which Hong Kong's residents were left with no doubt that SARS was to affect the general population, not merely the small circle of close medical and family contacts of existing SARS cases. 12 Using alternative dates adjusts estimates slightly upwards.",

It was relied upon as the main source of statistics. A building appeared on the list only within 10 days (the incubation period) of the onset date of any known SARS case; if the case was diagnosed after 10 days of the onset date, the building would not be listed. No information on the SARS case demographics, number of cases related to each listing, or connection among the cases was made available. As 8 I also calculated a predicted SARS risk indicator related to living conditions, based on scientific links cited in government and WHO reports. It does not have a significant impact. 9 The average decline in turnover rate is between one to five basis points. The pre-SARS average turnover rate is 6.8 basis points. 10 A search model predicts a dry up in transaction volume when search costs are high. While this might be part of the story, persistent drops in turnover rates imply this is not a complete explanation. 11 Adding to the complication, there was high-profile denial by the government about community spread of SARS on March 17, 2003. 12 As it turned out, less than a quarter of all SARS cases in Hong Kong affected health care workers, and most of the 329 infected residents in the first SARS cluster, Amoy Gardens, were strangers to each other. Source: The Standard; Oriental Daily; WHO website. such, the SARS-list contained only coarse information about the relative severity of the outbreak by location. The mass media filled part of the information gap. After March 26, SARS-related reports dominated newspaper headlines. Suspected SARS cases mentioned in the newspapers might or might not appear on the government SARS list, and there was often information on specific cases in other dimensions, such as demographics. I conducted a detailed study on newspaper reports that related specific housing estates to the epidemic.",

Any permanent decrease in annual housing service flows S, by contrast, causes a decrease one-for-one in Q. Clearly, the SARS threat must be perceived as permanent or long lasting to explain such a large decrease in prices under the standard rational asset-pricing model. The calculation above implicitly assumes a uniform impact of SARS on the value of housing services for all housing units in Hong Kong. In reality, besides decreasing the general quality of life in Hong Kong, thus creating a territory-wide impact, SARS also created a new health risk specific to each building. To consider relative price movements, one can think of higher-quality housing units as those that produce a larger quantity of housing services during any given time period. Health risk is substitutable for other building characteristics, such as number of rooms. Denoting the housing services provided by housing structure at time t by S(t), a positive SARS risk in year t reduces S so S(t) < S(t \u2212 1). The newly recognized health risk decreases the total expected units of housing services available in the market, reducing the supply of housing services and leading to a higher unit price for housing services.

They either postpone sale, or to set a higher asking price and wait to \"fish\" for a higher-than-average price offer. This implies an attenuated price decline 15 For example, when a hoax message posted by a 14-year-old on the Internet resulted in a wave of panic-buying of food stock, the government quieted fears by sending SMS messages to 6 million mobile phones.

I explore the impact of the Onlist indicator, which is defined as the number of days an estate appeared on the SARS-list during a given week. The SARS-list indicator, on the other hand, represents the cumulative number of days an estate had spent on the SARS-list. Despite potential spillovers of search cost increases across time, the increase in search costs are expected to be the most significant when the estates were still on the list and less so afterwards. Therefore the On-list indicator should have a larger turnover impact if search costs are the most important driver behind the turnover decrease in column (3). In results not shown, the On-list indicator is not statistically significant, lending support to the more complex stories of transaction volume that relate credit constraints and loss aversion in a down market to the observed price and volume changes.",

Compared to the predicted SARS risk measure which has no price or volume effect (column (7); Table 3 column (7)), the per capita SARS-list and the Chinese news indicators reduce turnover volume but have no significant price impact. The lack of impact by the predicted SARS risk measure is consistent with my conjecture earlier that the housing market calculated the future SARS risk differently or lacked information available to me. On the other hand, results do not suggest that the SARS-list or Chinese-language newspapers were ineffective in disseminating SARS-related information but that the information led to decreased turnover frequency and an attenuated price response. Two explanations can rationalize this result: either loss-averse sellers tried to attenuate the prospective loss by setting a higher asking price and waiting for a longer time to sell (the loss aversion model), or liquidity-constrained homeowners postponed sales or set a higher selling price (the downpayment model).",

The virus bears a particular relevance to the housing market because it is believed that building characteristics and environmental conditions made some housing estates more susceptible to the spread of the disease than others. During the epidemic, many Hong Kong residents took refuge in relatives' and friends' homes located in areas with fewer cases of SARS, and it was unclear whether the 8 percent housing price decline that coincided with the epidemic was a market reaction to expectations of a significant decrease in demand or a continuation of past trends. Exogenous and unanticipated, the 2003 SARS epidemic provides a unique setting to study whether emotions associated with extreme events have strong market implications as predicted by psychological and behavioral economics theories, or whether standard economic models built upon the assumption of rationality serve as reasonable benchmarks in predicting housing market reactions to extreme shocks.",

Using weekly fixed effects to absorb any territory-wide SARS impact or trend shifts, the various estate-specific SARS indicators capture price declines directly attributable to public information related to the SARS epidemic. This specification points to an average price decline of 2.61 percent.",

The price changes related to the estimated infection rate suggest that the marginal buyer in the housing market was aware of the SARS infection risk at the estate level, without any direct information on the magnitude of the risk. Price responses are also associated with per capita measures of newspaper mentions. No reaction is identified in relation to the more visible but cruder measures, such as the number of days listed on the government list or number of news mentions. This paints a different picture than some models of financial markets where agents with private information overweigh noises in public information (e.g. [11] ). To put the SARSrelated price decline in perspective, the implied economic value of life ranges from $110,000 to approximately $1 million. This estimate is toward the bottom end of the range in the existing literature, consistent with my conclusion that the housing market did not overreact to the epidemic [19] .",

Further findings indicate a turnover dry up that is more persistent than the increase in search costs brought about by the epidemic. Moreover, marked decreases in turnover are found in response to SARS indicators that do not have significant price impacts. This pattern points to a mechanism where expected downward pressure on prices leads to non-participation of sellers in the market and therefore a muted price response [4, 16] . Glaeser [5] argues that under situations when the costs of errors to the decision makers are high, mistaken beliefs such as overweighing of short-term well-being and overreaction should be less common. Given the importance of housing in the average Hong Kong household's wealth portfolio, it is perhaps unsurprising that the market adopted a cautious, wait-and-see attitude in response to the SARS epidemic and did not show significant signs of overreaction.",
