Methods: We estimated changes in monthly numbers of visitors to the Republic of Korea (ROK) in 2015 compared to projected values by selected areas. We tested whether areas' experience of a previous SARS outbreak of \u2265100 cases or distance to the ROK had a significant effect on travel to the ROK during the MERS outbreak using t-tests and regression models. Results: The percentage changes in visitors from areas with a previous SARS outbreak of \u2265100 cases decreased more than the percentage changes in visitors from their counterparts in June (52.4% vs. 23.3%) and July (60.0% vs. 31.4%) during the 2015 MERS outbreak. The percentage changes in visitors from the close and intermediate categories decreased more than the far category. The results from regression models and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that areas with \u2265100 SARS cases and closer proximity to the ROK had significantly larger percentage decreases in traveler volumes during the outbreak. Conclusions: During the 2015 MERS outbreak, areas with a previous sizable SARS outbreak and areas near the ROK showed greater decreases in percentage changes in visitors to the ROK.",

Selected areas in descending order of numbers of arrivals to the ROK during 2014 are China (mainland China excluding Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Macau, and Taiwan), Japan, United States (USA), Taiwan-China, Hong Kong SAR-China, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Russia, Indonesia, Singapore, India, Canada, Vietnam, Australia, United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and France.

The first variable was whether an area had a sizable outbreak of limited duration of a novel viral respiratory disease before the 2015 MERS outbreak. The 2003 SARS outbreak was chosen because it was sizable including local transmission and its duration was limited [8] . During the 2003 SARS outbreak, more than 8000 individuals were infected worldwide with a 9.6% average case fatality rate [9] . In addition, SARS and MERS are both viral respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses, although the case fatality rates reported for SARS were lower than for MERS [10] . Community transmission of SARS was more commonly reported, while MERS transmission in the ROK occurred primarily in healthcare settings or through close contact, e.g. caring for or living with an infected person [10, 11] . The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was also caused by viral respiratory infection; however, country-specific H1N1 attack rates were orders of magnitude higher and its case fatality rate was much lower compared to the limited-duration outbreaks of SARS and MERS [10, 12, 13] .",

China, Taiwan-China, Singapore, Canada, and Hong Kong SAR-China each had \u2265100 SARS cases during the 2003 outbreak, and all of those areas were included in the current analyses. Although the threshold was set at 100 probable SARS cases, each of the five areas experienced at least 238 probable SARS cases, while the country/area with next highest number of probable SARS cases, Vietnam, had 64 cases (Appendix Figure 3 ) [9] .

Since travel time cost is likely to be correlated to travel distance between two areas, the opportunity cost to change travel plans from a more distant place to the ROK would be expected to be higher. Thus, individuals from more distant areas might be less likely to cancel trips to the ROK during the outbreak period. We subdivided selected areas into three groups based on distance to the ROK: (1) close (China, Japan, Taiwan-China, and Hong Kong SAR-China), (2) intermediate (Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, India, and Vietnam), and (3) far (USA, Russia, Canada, Australia, UK, Germany, and France). More details about how we defined distance categories for analyses are shown in Appendix Tables 2 and 3 For both variables, we performed Welch's t-tests for two samples with unequal variances [14] to examine whether the monthly average percentage decreases in numbers of arrivals from each category differed significantly. For the SARS variable, the null hypothesis is that the simple average percentage change of arrivals from areas with < 100 SARS cases (reference) was the same as the percentage change of arrivals for areas with \u2265100 SARS cases. The alternative hypothesis is that the percentage decreases for arrivals from areas with \u2265100 SARS cases were larger than for areas with < 100 SARS cases. For the distance categories, the null hypothesis is that the simple average percentage change of arrivals from the far category (reference) was the same as the percentage change of arrivals from the intermediate or the close category. The alternative hypothesis is that the percentage decreases for arrivals from areas in the far category were smaller than for arrivals from the areas in the intermediate or the close categories. When p-values from Welch's t-tests are < 0.05, we reject the null hypotheses in favor of the alternative hypotheses.",

When an area \"i\" is in the \"Intermediate\" category, the variable is one, otherwise zero. In summary, the OLS model included two independent variables: 1) a binary variable to identify areas with \u2265100 SARS cases during the 2003 outbreak (reference category: < 100 SARS cases during the 2003 outbreak), and 2) a categorical variable summarizing the distance between an area and the ROK that was transformed into two binary variables (reference category: \"far\"). We conducted sensitivity analyses using alternative projected values. The baseline model used the average numbers of arrivals in 2013 and 2014 by area to project the expected numbers of arrivals to the ROK in the absence of the outbreak. The baseline model, however, may not account for year-to-year increasing or decreasing trends in the numbers of arrivals to the ROK. That omission could result in underestimated or overestimated projected values in the absence of the MERS outbreak, causing biased estimates from regression models. Thus, we examined two alternative models. For Alternative 2, we again started with the monthly average numbers of arrivals in 2013 and 2014. Since the ROK MERS outbreak was not expected to affect travel volumes during the pre-outbreak period in 2015, we compared the arrivals from January to May 2015 to the average number of arrivals from January to May in 2013 and 2014 to calculate an area-specific adjustment to the projected numbers of arrivals from June to December 2015 in the absence of the outbreak. Alternative 2 used the same method that was used to compare projected and actual numbers of arrivals in Mexico during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [15] .",

For example, a Korean traveler who was experiencing symptoms consistent with MERS pushed ahead with his plan to travel to Guangdong, China with a layover in Hong Kong SAR [17] . When this traveler was diagnosed with MERS after arrival in China, a public health response was required in China [2] . Although there was no further MERS transmission in China or Hong Kong SAR, public awareness of this imported case may have exacerbated fear among individuals in Hong Kong SAR and Guangdong as well as their local governments. In Taiwan, a patient with suspected MERS was reported on May 30, 2015, although this patient was later confirmed to have influenza B virus infection [30] . This suspected case was one of 17 suspected MERS cases reported in Taiwan between September 2012 and May 2015 [30] . The 17th suspected case was in a person who was neither a ROK citizen nor had visited the ROK [30] . However, the patient could have increased public awareness of MERS in Taiwan. Although countries issued varied levels of travel notices, no countries enforced travel bans or strict quarantine requirements for travelers from the ROK as some did for travelers from countries with Ebola during the West African epidemic [31] .",

The Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention updated its national prevention and control guidelines for MERS in April 2016 [32] . These guidelines include response plans at airports, hospitals, and local health departments to expedite the identification of individuals suspected of MERS-CoV infection after arriving from MERS-affected areas [32] . Following the guidelines, virological testing for MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses has been implemented to confirm whether individuals with recent travel to MERS-affected areas and symptoms consistent with MERS are infected with MERS-CoV or not [32, 33] . Also, the ROK's amended quarantine act specifies MERS as a quarantinable infectious disease [34] . These efforts may decrease the risk of future MERS outbreaks in the ROK. This analysis has some limitations. First, we assumed that the nationality of an individual was a proxy for the area of departure for that individual. For instance, a Japanese national may live in the United States before visiting the ROK but would be counted as if traveling from Japan (close category) for our analysis. Such discrepancies between citizenship and residency might cause some bias in examining the effect of distance on travel volumes to the ROK during the MERS outbreak.",

As we discussed, issuance of travel notices may correlate with past outbreak experience in that governments in countries or localities that previously experienced outbreaks may be more likely to issue stronger notices. In addition, stronger travel notices in some countries may have correlated with greater decreases in travel volumes during the MERS outbreak in the ROK. However, we were unable to create categorical variables for issuance of travel notices because each country has its own process and terminology for travel notices. Although many countries have similar structures for level of travel notices, they are not easily comparable. In addition to level, each travel notice contains outbreakspecific recommendations. Recommendations, such as avoiding unnecessary hospital visits while in the ROK, further complicate comparisons of the intensity of travel health notices among countries. Thus, we were unable to quantify differences between stronger and weaker travel notices across countries. Also, there could be other country-or area-specific factors, which could affect travel volumes during a disease outbreak, but were not considered in the current analyses.",

While SARS was also caused by a novel coronavirus resulting in respiratory disease similar to MERS, exposure to other sizable outbreaks, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic or the 2013-2015 Ebola epidemic, may also have affected governments' and individuals' perceptions of risk from the 2015 MERS outbreak. Although there was a large difference between the top five areas with at least 238 probable SARS cases for each and the next highest country with 63 probable SARS cases during the 2013 outbreak (Appendix Figure 3) , a single threshold of \u2265100 SARS cases were used. Also, a threshold of \u2265100 SARS cases was used without considering other potentially critical factors, such as population size, the extent of geographic area, the time duration of the SARS outbreak, or extent of unlinked community transmission. For instance, both Canada and Singapore had \u2265100 SARS cases in 2003. However, more than 95% of probable SARS cases in Canada (n = 247) were observed in the greater Toronto area [35] , a small part of Canada, while the SARS outbreak in Singapore (n = 238) was over the entire country [9] . Thus, Canadian governments' and individuals' perceptions of risk from the 2015 MERS outbreak associated with their SARS outbreak experience could be different from the perception of risk from the 2015 MERS outbreak in Singapore.",
