The first cases were recognized because of an unusual clustering of diseases such as Kaposi sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in young homosexual men. Although such unusual diseases had previously been observed in distinct subgroups of the population -such as older men of Mediterranean origin in the case of Kaposi sarcoma or severely immunosuppressed cancer patients in the case of PCP -the occurrence of these diseases in previously healthy young people was unprecedented. Since most of the first cases of this newly defined clinical syndrome involved homosexual men, lifestyle practices were first implicated and intensively investigated. These included the exposure to amyl or butyl nitrate 'poppers' or the frequent contact with sperm through rectal sex, which might have acted as immunostimulatory doses of foreign proteins or antigens.",

Similar to investigations of male homosexual populations, these new risk groups were exposed to doses of foreign proteins and antigens but through the blood. In the case of IDUs, this would occur through intravenous injection of drugs and needle sharing, and in the case of hemophiliacs through the therapeutic infusion of Factor VIII. Asymptomatic hemophiliacs and IDUs were often found to have unusual immunological tests, such as the inverted T lymphocyte helper:suppressor ratios (i.e. less than the normal 1:1 ratio of helper to suppressor cells). These abnormal tests suggested a problem with the cellular immune system, with low numbers of helper T lymphocytes, also referred to as CD4\u03e9 lymphocytes, a finding similar to that observed in many AIDS patients.",

These studies measured and compared seroprevalence rates for suspect viruses in AIDS patients and controls.

However, based on the unique clinical syndrome and unusual epidemiology of AIDS, if one of these viruses was to be etiologically involved, it would presumably have been a newly mutated or recombinant genetic variant.",

Indeed, HTLV, discovered by Gallo and his colleagues in 1980, was the only human virus known to infect T helper (CD4\u03e9 ) lymphocytes at that time (Poiesz et al., 1980) . This seemed reasonable since it was already clear that T helper lymphocytes were selectively depleted by the causative agent in clinical AIDS (Rubinstein et al., 1983; Ammann et al., 1983; Fahey et al., 1984; Lane et al., 1985) . In addition, HTLV was known to transmit through the same routes as the etiologic agent of AIDS: sexual contact (with transmission apparently more efficient from males), by blood, and from mother to baby (Essex, 1982) . Finally, HTLV-I was also known to induce immunosuppression (Essex et al., 1984) , as we had previously recognized in animal retrovirus systems (Essex et al., 1985) .",

Soon after, Gallo and his colleagues obtained proof that AIDS was linked to an HTLV Gallo et al., 1984; Schupbach et al., 1984) . Further characterization of the agent -now termed HIV-1 -revealed that it was the same as the isolate detected earlier by Montagnier and his colleagues (Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983) . Despite controversy over the names and identity of certain isolates, this new and unique human pathogen was clearly not only a distant genetic relative of the known HTLV virus but may have been recently introduced to humans from a primate reservoir (Essex and Kanki, 1988) .",

This raised the question of whether HIV-1 was also new to Old World human populations, such as Africa, or whether it recently entered humans from another species. Reports of diseases such as AIDS had not been reported in these populations. It is conceivable that if HIV-1 had been present in Africa for some time, the interplay between pathogen and host would have led to a less virulent virus and people with genetic resistance to the lethal properties of the virus. However, early clinical studies did not indicate differences in the pathogenicity of the virus-host interactions in Africa compared with the United States or Europe.",

Serum samples collected from Africans at earlier periods were also examined for the presence of antibodies reactive with HIV-1. In some cases, the examination of stored samples suggested elevated rates of infection in Africa during the mid-1960s to 1970s (Saxinger et al., 1985) . Subsequently, it was revealed that most of those surveys were conducted with first-stage tests that were imperfect. In addition, the reactors were mostly false positives, due either to contamination of the HIV antigen or to 'sticky sera' containing antibodies that reacted non-specifically because the sera had been repeatedly frozen and thawed and maintained under poor conditions. While examining sera taken from Africa in the period 1955 to 1965, we found one antibody-positive sample that was clearly positive in a specific manner (Nahmias et al., 1986) . When tested with the highly specific test radioimmunoprecipitation, this sample contained high titers of antibodies that were reactive with virtually all the major antigens of HIV-1. This sample represented only a rare positive reactor in a high-risk group of individuals suffering from tuberculosis and AIDS-like illness in a region that subsequently had high rates of infection with HIV-1. However, only 1 per cent or fewer of the individuals who tested positive were from what is now classified as a region of moderate to high prevalence (Kinshasa, Zaire), which suggests that the virus was then only rarely present in places that would now be classified as within the 'AIDS Belt of Africa.'",

The definition of AIDS as an amalgamation of clinical outcomes ranging from tuberculosis to chronic diarrhea to cancer (e.g. lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma) also may cause confusion for those trying to accept HIV-1 as the single etiologic cause.

In prospective cohort studies, almost all HIV-1-infected people eventually develop immune depletion. This association is much higher than for such viral infections as polio or flu.

Further, while the very low rate of infected circulating lymphocytes was interpreted by some as incompatible with the destruction of large numbers of cells, recent studies reveal that most HIV-1 is in lymph nodes rather than blood, and up to 25-50 per cent of lymph node T cells may be infected (Pantaleo et al., 1993) . HIV-1 is also highly unusual as a virus that targets T4 lymphocytes and macrophages, both essential components of the immune system. Finally, HIV-1 is transmitted in exactly the same way as clinical AIDS: by blood, by sex, and from mother to infant.

We tested the hypothesis that the natural primate host for SIV would be able to sustain infection without significant disease, and that this primate would most likely reside in Africa.

Further studies of wild-caught Asian monkeys demonstrated that SIV was not a natural infection of these primates.

The high prevalence of infection in wildcaught monkeys supported the notion that these African species of primates had evolved to a more benign coexistence with the virus in which infection did not affect survival. This was clearly different from the case of SIV in Asian primates or HIV-1 in people. Because wild macaques do not appear to be infected with SIV, and because the virus is limited to African primates, it appears likely that the virus accidentally infected captive rhesus monkeys in recent times. New SIVs are still being described and it is possible that species specificity may play a role in the level of host-virus adaptation and therefore levels of population infection (Georges-Courbot et al., 1998) . Currently it appears that natural SIV infection of African primates does not result in significant disease, supported by the high seroprevalence rates in most species evaluated. It thus appears that virus-host interaction has resulted in a non-pathogenic infection and the genetic, immunological and virus determinants of this relationship are worthy of further study.",

The transcription process is performed by the virus enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is error-prone. As a result, each round of replication results in at least one mutation per genome copy. The genetic variation of HIV is hierarchical, as depicted in the simplified schematic of subtype variation, interpatient variation, and intrapatient variation (Figure 1.1) . HIV-1 virus isolates from North Americans and Europeans showed distinct genetic variability compared with the variability in viruses from African patients Burke and McCutchan, 1997) . This variability was more dramatic than the recognized genetic variability between viral isolates from a single geographic region (i.e. inter-isolate variability) (Myers and Pavlakis, 1992; Korber et al., 1995) . In turn, this was also distinguishable from the genetic variation that was seen at the level of an individual patient (i.e. intrapatient variability). At the level of the individual patient, a swarm or quasi-species of highly related but distinguishable viral variants has been demonstrated throughout the course of HIV infection (Goodenow et al., 1989; Balfe et al., 1990; Delassus et al., 1991) . Genetic diversity is therefore a major characteristic of the HIV viruses and provides a major obstacle to drug and vaccine development.",

By the early to mid-1990s, HIV-1 subtype E had spread very rapidly throughout heterosexuals in Thailand, with the highest rates in the northern regions of the country (Weniger et al., 1994) . Although apparently present earlier in the region, HIV-1 subtype B never spread to cause a major heterosexual epidemic as did HIV-1 subtype E. In China, the epidemic in IDUs is a unique recombinant virus of C and B. In heterosexual populations, subtype E appears to be the predominant subtype, similar to that of much of South-East Asia.

Previously associated with the massive heterosexual epidemic in southeastern Africa, subtype C also caused a rapid heterosexual epidemic in western India, initially spreading from the Bombay region (Jain et al., 1994; Weniger et al., 1994) . In the past 7-8 years, it is clear that subtype C is the sole viral subtype responsible for the newest and perhaps most frightening of HIV epidemics, worldwide. In most countries of southern Africa, rapid dissemination of HIV infection has been described with rates ranging from 10 to 40 per cent in pregnant women in most countries of the region. As a result of these significant increases in subtype C infection in Africa, and its predominance in places such as India and perhaps China, this viral subtype is responsible for over half of all HIV infections worldwide (UNAIDS, 2002 ).",

This suggests that the viral properties of non-B subtype viruses would facilitate heterosexual transmission and may have contributed to the dramatic epidemic spread in Asia and Africa (Soto-Ramirez et al., 1996) . A cross-sectional study of heterosexual couples in Thailand suggests a higher risk of heterosexual transmission of subtype E compared with subtype B (Kunanusont et al., 1995) . Studies in many African countries have described multiple HIV-1 subtypes, but it is not known if subtypes enter populations at different time points, or if the distribution of subtypes reflects the dynamics of different subtype-specific transmission potentials. Studies in South Africa demonstrate the association of certain subtypes with different modes of HIV transmission: subtype B viruses are associated with homosexual transmission, and non-B subtypes are associated with heterosexual transmission (Vanharmelen et al., 1997) .

If efficient heterosexual transmission requires a particular genotype for vaginal infection, such sequences may have been partially lost by these HIV-1 B 'strains' that have been repeatedly passaged by blood exposure or rectal intercourse. Many of the non-B subtypes, on the other hand, could theoretically maintain vaginal phenotypic properties through regular heterosexual transmission in Africa and Asia (Kunanusont et al., 1995; Soto-Ramirez et al., 1996) .",

The comparison of non-A subtypes with subtype A demonstrated a significantly longer AIDS-free survival for women infected with subtype A. Due to the small sample size per subtype, our estimate of AIDS incidence should be considered imprecise, and further study is clearly warranted. Cross-sectional studies indicate a significant proportion of AIDS cases with subtype A infection in West and East Africa (PJ Kanki, unpublished data, 1998) . Further study of HIV-1 subtype natural history and progression from different geographic regions is clearly needed to better evaluate the role of viral subtype differences and AIDS pathogenesis.",

Historically, CD4\u03e9 T lymphocyte counts provided the most reliable prognostic marker of HIV progression (Fahey et al., 1984) . In addition, other prognostic markers of progression to AIDS included immunologic markers of immune dysfunction which included cutaneous anergy (Redfield et al., 1986; Blatt et al., 1993) , serum \u24242-microglobulin, and neopterin levels (Fahey et al., 1990) .

The primers need to be as similar to the original target sequence as possible. Once the primers anneal to the target sequence the temperature-sensitive polymerase begins to transcribe sequences, matching the sequence that it has found in the sample. When the temperature increases, the strands of DNA separate and the primer binding and polymerase reaction occurs again. In this way, a large number of exact DNA copies can be made given the cycles of temperature and the availability of primer, nucleotides, and polymerase.",

Genetic diversity in HIV evidenced by different strains or subtypes has yielded a complex global map of variant viruses, affecting our ability to diagnose, treat, and ultimately vaccinate against an ever-changing set of viruses.
