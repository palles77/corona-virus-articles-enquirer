In general, water is often taken lightly in most food preparation and processing operations. Water has a wide variety of uses in food production, for cleaning, sanitation, and manufacturing purposes. In addition to being an ingredient in many foods, it may be used for various other operations, such as for growing, unloading, fluming, washing, brining, ice manufacture, and in sanitation and in hygiene programs. Water quality has great detrimental impact on products and operations in food production systems. The fundamental importance of water quality in food production is often underestimated. This underestimation generally becomes the underlying cause for several problems, such as mismanagement of water, equipment operation, and maintenance issues; loss of revenue; food safety; and product quality.",

Food safety is a very broad term. It covers many aspects of handling, preparation, and storage of food. Water is an inherent component in food production. In-depth understanding is required to know the impact of these factors on food safety. Every care in detail is essential to prevent illness and injury from the viewpoint of food production. Food production also covers chemical, microbiological, and microphysical aspects of water and food safety. Therefore, for adequate control of food chemical quality, control of allergens that can be life threatening to people who are highly sensitive to such allergens gets top priority in ensuring food safety. Any pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and microorganisms may produce toxins, which act as possible contaminants of water used in food production and that therefore affect food safety. At times, microphysical particles such as glass and metal, when present in water, can be hazardous and cause serious harm to consumers. or, after being used by plants, as 'productive transpiration'. This second type of rain water is called green water. The proportion of green water, out of the total available freshwater supply, varies between 55% and 80%, depending on the local wood density as well as on the region of the world. Storing of more green water in soil and plants, as well as storage as blue water, is the biggest opportunity and challenge for future water management.",

Of these, 70% is being used for irrigation (2700 km 3 ) and the remaining 1200 km 3 is used for industry and households, while only a very small part of this water cycle serves as drinking water (Aquastat, 2014) .",

Adequate treatment of the water is necessary to ensure that it meets a drinking water standard which is safe to be used in food production (i.e., safe for human consumption). The food industry is supplied drinking water primarily in two ways. Firstly, it is by public distribution by local government authorities, and secondly through private supply by the food business itself.

Food production from the livestock sector has diversity such as meat (beef, pork, poultry, and others), dairy products, and fishes, aquatic or sea food.

The most logical reason lies in the fact that animals are secondary consumers in the food chain; therefore, in the calculation of water footprint of animals always adds up inherent increments of primary consumers. Twenty-nine percent of the total water footprint of the agricultural products in the world is related to the generation of animal products. One third of the global water footprint of animal production is related to beef cattle (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010) .",

The on-going shift from traditional extensive and mixed farming to industrial farming systems is likely to continue to meet this rising demand for animal products. This intensification of animal production systems will result in increasing blue and gray water footprints per unit of animal product due to the larger dependence on concentrate feed in industrial systems. The pressure on the global freshwater resources will therefore increase both because of the increasing meat consumption and the increasing blue and gray water footprint per unit of meat consumed (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010) .",

            "text": "Virtual water concept emerged in the 1990s to draw increasing focus of people concerned with water management, and in particular with water related to food production. Virtual water is defined as the water embedded in a product, that is, the water consumed during its process of production. The value is generally expressed in terms of volume (m 3 ), which results from multiplying the quantity of product (kg) by the unit value. On an average, it takes 2\u00c04 L/day to satisfy the biological needs of drinking water of a human being. This may be around 1000 times as much water as required to produce the food for normal person. Therefore, the concept of virtual water is so important when discussing food production and consumption. In other words, when a country imports 1 million tons of wheat, it is also enlarging its water resource by 1 billion m 3 of water. Specific values for the water equivalent of a selection of food products are variable, and it is highest for animal food. For instance: Cattle 4000 m 3 /unit; Sheep and Goat 500 m 3 /unit; as compared to plant food like palm oil 2 m 3 /unit; fruits, pulses, and vegetables 1 m 3 /unit of consumption. At a global level, the importance of virtual water is likely to dramatically increase as projections show that food trade will increase rapidly. It may be doubling for cereals and tripling for meat between 1993 and 2020. Hence, the transfer of virtual water embedded in the food which is traded is becoming an important component of water management on a global as well as regional level, especially in the water scarce regions (Renault, 2002) .",

Giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis are the second largest cause of water-borne disease, due to transmission of microscopic parasites or cysts of Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Giardia is found worldwide and is within every region of Canada and the United States. The third top most water-borne disease is dysentery caused either by Entamoeba histolytica amebic dysentery and/or by salmonella and shigella bacillary dysentery. Dysentery kills around 700,000 people worldwide every year. Salmonella bongori and Samonella enteric are gram negative rod bacteria with .2500 serotypes or serovars known to cause the water-borne salmonellosis. Each year, almost 1 in 10 people fall sick and that results in loss of 33 million of healthy life years. It is one of the four key global causes of diarrheal diseases. Followed by this is typhoid fever due to Salmonella typhi bacterium at fifth place. An estimated 11\u00c020 million people get sick from typhoid and between 128,000 and 161,000 people die per year. Next popular is cholera due to Vibrio cholera bacterium with 1.3\u00c04.0 million cases per year, and 21,000\u00c0143,000 deaths worldwide are due to cholera. Viral hepatitis caused by the A virus is largely an endemic disease with transmission through water. Epidemics of A virus can be explosive and cause substantial economic loss. Similarly, the viral hepatitis caused by the E virus (HEV) can result in epidemics if common community water sources get polluted. It is estimated that there are 20 million HEV infections worldwide each year, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis-E. Worldwide, 1 in 10 people fall ill due to infection by Campylobacter, a spiral-shaped, S-shaped, or curved, rod-shaped bacteria. C. jejuni (subspecies jejuni) and C. coli.

This power of water purification of soil is due to the removal of contaminants by physical capture as the water moves through micropore spaces in soil particles. Further removal is by chemical adsorption to solid surfaces, and by means of the biodegradation carried out by microorganisms living in the soil (Helmke and Losco, 2013) . Soils that have desirable properties such as well-developed structure and sufficient organic matter act as efficient filters and purify the surface water as it percolates to lower strata. Soil degradation, which includes soil erosion and loss of soil structure and nutrient content, has negative impact on crop production and threatens food security (Brevik, 2013b; Mishra et al., 2016) . In recent times, environmental pollution and food safety are two of the most important emerging issues. Soil and water pollution have historically impacted on food safety, and have serious important threats to human health. Heavy metals in soil, which is toxic to humans, usually pass on to humans through crop uptake and thus compromise food safety. The increasing negative effects on food safety from water and soil pollution have put more people at risk of carcinogenic diseases (Lu et al., 2015) . In this context, soil can have great influence on human health. When the soil degradation occurs, it generally has negative health effects on human health. It may directly affect health through drinking water or indirectly through food that accumulate the pollutants such as heavy metals, organic chemicals, or soil pathogens.",

However, soil also serves as a home for many pathogenic organisms. More than 400 genera of bacteria have been identified together with as many as 10,000 species. These bacteria, with the exception of viruses, in most cases, are more abundant than any other organism in soils (Nieder et al., 2018) . Around 300 soil fungi species, out of the vast numbers of more than 100,000 fungi species that occur in soils, are known to cause disease in humans (Bultman et al., 2005; Nieder et al., 2018) . For instance, the soil fungus Exserohilium rostratum caused a fungal meningitis outbreak in the United States in 2012 (Brevik and Burgess, 2013) . Most of the protozoans that are found in soil feed on organic matter, including bacteria and algae; however, a few of these cause human parasitic diseases like diarrhea and amebic dysentery (Brevik et al., 2018) . Soil serves as a common reservoir for helminthes. Helminths are parasites that may inhabit the human intestines, lymph system, or other tissues. Helminthic diseases require a nonanimal intermediate host like humans for transmission. Billions of people are infected by helminths worldwide each year, with an estimated 130,000 deaths annually (Abdeltawabi et al., 2017) . Helminth infections generally occur via ingestion of contaminated water and food, and in most cases it involves intestinal infection (Nieder et al., 2018) . Soil is not a natural reservoir for viruses; however, viruses are known to survive and stay in a dormant state for years together in soil. Pathogenic viruses are generally introduced into soil via human septic or sewage waste. Viruses that cause communicable diseases like conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, polio, aseptic meningitis, or smallpox have all been detected in soil (Bultman et al., 2005; Hamilton et al., 2007; Nieder et al., 2018) .",

Although it is a highly controversial topic, it may be viewed and if ethically used, it is an emerging highly promising technology. This genetic technology, if carefully regulated and tested, should have much-desired beneficial effects in terms of water conservation. The most logical approach in the genetic modification, for example, should be the selection of the traits to increase the rate of photosynthesis, depth of root structure, as well as a decrease the transpiration rate at which water is lost. This strategy should increase the nutrients yield of the crop and at the same time decrease the water requirement of the staple cereal crops. These changes have the great positive potential to lower pressures on the amount of global water resources required in food production. The enormous potential and the promising possibilities of genetic engineering and biotechnology research and development have the better future solutions to the current problems of water conservation, specifically in primary food production. Therefore, more precise and highly controlled and targeted genetic modifications should be very helpful in wheat, rice, and maize to increase their water efficiency and drought resistance.

Such underestimation often leads to mismanagement of water, equipment operation and maintenance issues, loss of income, food product quality, and safety. The agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water, compared to any other sector. The water footprint of any animal food product is larger than the water footprint of a plant product with equivalent nutritional value. In the world, 29% of the total water footprint of the agricultural sector is related to the production of animal products. The production of meat requires between 6 and 20 times more water as compared to cereals, vegetables, or fruits. The global meat production has almost doubled since 1980, and this trend is likely to continue given the projected doubling of meat production up to 2050. The shift from traditional extensive and mixed farming to industrial farming systems is likely to continue to meet this rising demand for animal products. Due to the larger dependence on concentrate feed in industrial systems, intensification of animal production systems will result in increasing blue and gray water footprints per unit of animal product. The pressure on the global freshwater resources will therefore increase both due to the increasing meat consumption together with the increasing blue and gray water footprint per unit of meat consumed. Therefore, the biggest opportunity and challenge for future water management for us is to store more green water in soil and plants, as well as to increase the storage as blue water.",
