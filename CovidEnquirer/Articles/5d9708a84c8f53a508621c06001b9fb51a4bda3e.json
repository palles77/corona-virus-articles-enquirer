At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall. Even higher nucleotide sequence identity was found in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of the five strains, which may reflect the role of the 3' UTR in negative-strand RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, singlestranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that are important respiratory, neurologic, and enteric pathogens for humans and domestic animals (1) . Having the largest genomic coding capacities among RNA viruses (at least 27 kb) as well as a unique strategy of RNA replication, coronaviruses represent very unusual and interesting molecular biological entities (2, 3) . To gain insight into the roles played by the coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein during viral infection, we have been characterizing this protein in the well-studied coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).",

To this end, we have cloned and sequenced the N genes of four strain's of MHV: MHV-A59, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-1. Although closely related, these viruses have distinct histories, most notably, separate times and geographic loci of isolation and different mouse strains of origin (4-7). As well, the N proteins of these MHV strains exhibit considerable electrophoretic mobility variation on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophore- Multiple cDNA clones, prepared from poly(A)-containing RNAfrom infected mouse 17 clone 1 cells, were used to determine the nucleotide sequences of the N genes of MHV-A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and MHV-S. MHV-A59 was taken as our reference strain because its sequence had been previously reported (11, 12) and because our heat-stable variant of this strain is the parent of a number of temperature-sensitive mutants that we plan to characterize in future work (L. S. Sturman et a/., manuscript in preparation).",

By contrast, the most conserved portion of the N genes occurs in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), which diverge by no more than 3 nt over a total span of 301 nt.

We suggest that A and B have less constraint on their amino acid sequences and principally serve as spacers connecting the three conserved domains. In contradistinction, domains I, II, and III appear to tolerate few amino acid changes, implying that most changes in these regions impair the functioning of the molecule. This model is supported by two further observations. First, we have characterized a temperature-sensitive N protein mutant of MHV-A59 that has a deletion almost exactly coincident with spacer B, indicating that, at least at the permissive temperature, the presence of this region is not absolutely required for N protein function (C. A. Koetzner et a/., unpublished results). Second, in an in vitro assay system, domains I and III were found to be dispensible for the binding of N protein to RNA, suggesting that the RNA-binding characteristic of N resides in domain II (P. S. Masters, manuscript in preparation).",

This might have suggested that these two regions are required to vary coordinately: i.e., an \"A59-like\" spacer A must always pair with an A59-like spacer B and a \"JHM-like\" spacer A must always pair with a JHM-like spacer B. However, the N protein of MHV-S clearly rules out this possibility, since this N protein has a JHM-like spacer A and an A59-like spacer B (Figs. 2 and 3) . Thus, the MHV-S N gene is likely to have arisen from a recombination event between two ancestral viruses: one having an N gene more similar to MHV-A59 and MHV-3 and the other having an N gene more similar to MHV-1 and MHV-JHM. RNA recombination among murine coronaviruses has been shown to occur both in tissue culture and in the brains of doubly infected animals (19, 20) . All five N gene sequences compared here, then, appear to be accounted for by either drift or recombination plus drift from two prototype genes.",

The MHV-JHM N gene contains a very similar ORF in the same position, but this is interrupted by a stop codon following the 16th amino acid residue. For all of the N genes, the start codon for the internal ORF occurs in a strong context for translation initiation, whereas the N protein start codon (nt l-3) and an intervening start codon (nt 26-28) both fall in suboptimal contexts. Thus, it is possible that the internal ORF may be translated by means of a \"leaky scanning\" mechanism (21) .
