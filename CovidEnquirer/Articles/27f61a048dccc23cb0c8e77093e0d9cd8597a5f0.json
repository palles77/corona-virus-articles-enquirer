            "text": "Roger Y. Dodd, PhD Transmission of infectious agents has long been recognized as an adverse outcome of transfusion, with the earliest concerns directed toward syphilis and viral hepatitis. Testing donors for evidence of syphilis infection was established in the 1940s, but in the absence of effective knowledge about viral hepatitis, the earliest measures relied on questioning of donors about a history of hepatitis: a precaution still in place, despite its currently demonstrable absence of value. The frequency of post-transfusion hepatitis prompted epidemiologic studies in the late 1950s, eventually leading to the elimination of blood collection from prison inmates and discouraging the use of paid donors. The essentially serendipitous discovery of HBsAg and of its relationship to hepatitis B opened up the use of donor testing but also revealed that another viral hepatitis (subsequently termed hepatitis C) was transmissible by transfusion. After a great deal of pioneering work, the causative agent (hepatitis C virus [HCV] ) was identified by molecular techniques, antigens were expressed, and a test for antibodies to virus was developed and implemented for blood donors in 1990. Additionally, over the years, it became apparent that malaria could be transmitted by transfusion and deferral policies were established to prevent the collection of blood from individuals potentially exposed to malaria outside the United States. Taken together, these approaches, established for existing, chronic infections, defined the mechanisms for dealing with subsequent transfusion transmitted diseases.",

But the advent of AIDS, the appearance of other novel diseases in human populations, and the expansion of other known infections led to the now well-established concept of emerging infections. These have been defined as those infections whose incidence in humans has increased within the past 2 decades or threatens to increase in the near future. There are many reasons that infections emerge; these have been described elsewhere, 1 but some key factors include ecological disturbances (including climate change), changes in human behaviors, failure of disease and vector control, urbanization, population movement, and genetic change among disease agents. Often, these and other factors work in concert.",

It has also become apparent that, although HIV, the first emerging infection to have a significant impact on blood safety, was chronic, parenterally and sexually transmissible, these characteristics did not all apply to subsequent transfusion transmissible emerging agents, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), West Nile virus (WNV) and Babesia. Thus, although it is important to be prepared for emerging infections that threaten blood safety, it will never be possible to make an accurate determination of the next agent of concern. A framework can be built to establish readiness for such an event, however. One such attempt is a recent effort to catalog and prioritize agents of likely concern. 5 HIV/AIDS As discussed previously, HIV/AIDS was the first emerging infection to have a profound and unexpected effect on blood safety. It was first recognized as a syndrome of unusual opportunistic infections and a normally rare malignancy (Kaposi's sarcoma) among gay males, Haitian immigrants, drug abusers, and hemophiliacs. The etiology of the disease was unclear, although a leading hypothesis was that it was caused by an infectious agent. Eventually, a few cases were observed among individuals whose only potential risk factor was prior receipt of a blood transfusion. 6 Eventually, the etiologic agent was determined to be a retrovirus, now known as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), codiscovered by Montagnier and Gallo and their collaborators in 1983-1984. 7, 8 By March of 1985, tests for antibodies to HIV had been developed and commercialized and their routine use for blood donations had been initiated.",

As a result, many individuals had unknowingly been infected and at least 12,000 transfusion transmissions had occurred in the United States alone. 9 This occurred in spite of measures that had been taken to defer donors with risk factors, in part because they had been implemented too late. Back-calculation showed that more than 1% of blood donations in San Francisco were probably infectious for AIDS at the beginning of the 1980s and that preventative measures resulted in a major decrease in that risk even before testing was put in place. 10 Because of the social sensitivity of the issues, early measures placed much reliance on education of donor populations and requests for self-deferral of those with risk factors, but within a few years, direct questioning of donors had been introduced. Even at the height of the epidemic, fewer that 2% of all AIDS cases in the United States were attributable to transfusion.",

The majority of seropositive individuals were men with a history of having had sex with other men; this finding led to a tightening of donor questioning strategies. 11 Measures to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by transfusion have continued to be refined and tightened over the years, with increasing focus on: donor questioning; enhanced test sensitivity, including the addition of nucleic acid testing in 1999 (in the United States); and, now, interest in the implementation of pathogen reduction technology. The measures taken to date have proved efficacious: modeling studies suggest that the residual risk of transfusion transmission is on the order of 1 per 1.5 to 2 million component units in the United States, but the actual number of transmissions detected is much lower, with only 4 cases recognized in the United States between 1999 and 2009.",

It undoubtedly had a profound impact on transfusion medicine, but it also materially affected and reoriented global attitudes toward blood safety. Before the advent of AIDS, there was a prevailing attitude that the development of some cases of post-transfusion infection was expected as an inevitable consequence of transfusion. This is not to say the issue was ignored, rather, that it was not an overriding priority. In several countries, those responsible for transfusion were subsequently held responsible for failing to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS by transfusion and were actually prosecuted. In addition, many civil cases were brought against hospitals and blood centers on behalf of patients who had been infected. Whether or not these responses were appropriate will continue to be argued, but it is clear that there is now a low tolerance for failing to deal with any transfusion-transmitted infection. This may best be illustrated by the high cost-effectiveness ratio of many of the measures that have been routinely implemented in support of blood safety.",

Also, transfusion transmission of animal-adapted strains has been shown in small animal models. When vCJD first appeared in humans (as a result of exposure to the BSE agent present in the food chain), there was concern that this new, emergent transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) might prove a risk to transfusion safety. This concern arose from the unknown nature of the infection and its unusual association with lymphoid cells and tissues. As a result, several preventative measures were put in place, well before there was any actual evidence of transfusion transmission. In the United States, the primary intervention was to defer as donors any individuals who had spent time in the United Kingdom at the peak of the BSE epidemic. The deferral was subsequently extended by including Western European countries (albeit with a different residence time) and eventually by deferring individuals receiving a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom. Several other Emerging Pathogens in Transfusion Medicine criteria for deferral were also introduced; all are described on the Food and Drug Administraion Web site (http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/default.htm). In the United Kingdom, the deferral option was not available, but universal leukodepletion was introduced, locally derived plasma was no longer sent for fractionation, and plasma for transfusion was imported from countries at low risk of BSE.",

In a fourth instance, the agent was found in the spleen and 1 lymph node of a similarly exposed but asymptomatic individual who died of unconnected causes. The source of the infection was a donor who had transmitted the disease to 1 of the other 3 cases. All of these cases were attributable to blood components that had not been leukoreduced. More recently, the agent was also identified at autopsy in a hemophilia patient who had received products from plasma pools that included units thought to be at risk of containing the agent (http://www.hpa.org.uk/ webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1234859690542?p51231252394302). The agent has also been shown to be transmissible in a sheep model. 16 At the time of this writing, the small epidemic of vCJD seems to be declining, although there is some concern that there may be future waves of disease among individuals with a genotype that differs from the one seen in almost all clinical cases of vCJD to date. Further, management of the food chain has reduced or eliminated the risk of food-borne exposure to BSE. In these circumstances, the need for further interventions may be arguable. This would be the case in the United States, where there do not yet seem to be any cases of locally acquired vCJD. Nevertheless, 2 companies have developed and CE-marked affinity based systems for removal of TSE prions from red cell concentrates. 17, 18 One of them has been evaluated in the United Kingdom and Ireland.",

Perhaps unexpectedly, the virus rapidly spread across the continent, infecting hundreds of thousands of individuals. 19 Although the resulting infections were acute, modeling studies suggested that transfusion transmission of WNV was possible and shortly after the first such study was published in 2002, 20 23 transfusion transmissions were reported. 21 As a result of an exemplary cooperation between manufacturers, transfusion medicine specialists, public health authorities, and regulators, tests for WNV RNA were developed, commercialized and implemented within less than 1 year. The strategy has been successful, although it is not possible to prevent all infections solely by the use of pooled testing: conversion to single donation testing is necessary in times and places with high incidence rates for infection.

Extended research studies showed that a significant proportion of blood donors, particularly in California and Florida, were infected with T cruzi. 25 A test for antibodies to T cruzi was licensed in the United States in late 2006 and was implemented at the beginning of 2007. Nationwide, the donor prevalence rate was found to be approximately 1:30,000. 26 Some of the seropositive donors did not have geographic risk factors and seemed to have been infected in the United States. Lookback studies on prior recipients of blood from seropositive donors, however, revealed only 2 infections from a total of 241 recipients examined (http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/ BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/BloodProductsAdvisoryCommittee/ucm155529. htm). This was 1 of the factors that led to a reevaluation of the value of testing and consideration of selective testing strategies. Such strategies were discussed at a meeting of the FDA's Blood Products Advisory Committee. The Committee endorsed the concept of selective testing, specifically on the basis of testing each donor once and accepting seronegative donors without need for any futher testing. The Committtee did, however, express concern abut the possibility of incident (new) infections among donors and recommended that selective testing be considered only if a continuing study of incidence of T cruzi infection among donors was to be conducted. One major blood supplier in the United States implemented selective (1-time) testing in August 2009 and several other smaller establishments used a variety of alternate approaches to selective testing.",

In late 2009, there was an outbreak of locally transmitted dengue in Key West (http://www.doh. state.fl.us/Environment/medicine/arboviral/Dengue_FloridaKeys.html). Certainly, A aegypti (the preferred vector for DENV) is present in parts of the Southern United States; thus, conditions exist for some spread of the virus on the mainland. It is not, however, clear that sustained transmission could occur. The issue for chikungunya may be a little more complex, as A albopictus is much more widespread and chikungunya cases among travelers returning to the United States are not uncommon. 39 There are many other arboviruses, but there is really no clear basis for making any predictions about their future spread.",

Also, the absence of methods that can inactivate all blood components is a disadvantage. It is also apparent that currently available methods do have some negative impact upon treated products. No method is currently available for use in the United States and the regulatory barrier appears to be high. Available methods, their properties and advantages and disadvantages are described in several reviews and other publications. 5, 51, 52 ",
