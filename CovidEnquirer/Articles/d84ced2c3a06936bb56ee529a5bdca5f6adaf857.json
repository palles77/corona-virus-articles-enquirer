A total of 44 healthy adult Chinese rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: Group A (n=15), administered a combination of lipopolysaccharide and hormone to establish the SANFH animal model; group B (n=15), SANFH animal model as in group A orally administered LEV (0.4 g/kg/day) on the day of injection; and group C (n=14), the control group. On the 6th and 8th week of modeling, seven rabbits from each group were sacrificed to harvest bilateral femoral head specimens for hematoxylin and eosin staining and apoptosis detection by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay analysis, as well as for observing pathological changes and analyzing cellular apoptosis. Eight weeks after modeling, the serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels of the three groups were measured. The empty lacunae rate and apoptosis index of bone cells in the treatment group were significantly lower than that of the model group (P<0.01). Eight weeks after treatment, the serum levels of IGF-1 were significantly higher than that of the model group (P<0.01). These findings suggested that LEV was able to reduce steroid-induced bone cellular apoptosis, reduce the occurrence of necrosis of the femoral head and, through in vivo metabolism, it may promote the synthesis and release of IGF-1, which could be one of its biological pathways to prevent and treat SANFH.",

            "text": "Since the 1950s, glucocorticoids had been widely used in clinical practice as an effective means of treating diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and those caused by kidney transplantation, resulting in an increase in the number of steroid-associated necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) cases (1) (2) (3) . SANFH is the most common cause of non-traumatic osteonecrosis (2) . For the past 40 years, Chinese and foreign researchers have investigated SANFH; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. There are a variety of theories as to what is associated with the pathogenesis SANFH, including dyslipidemia, intravascular coagulation, immune complex deposition-induced arterial inflammation, osteoporosis, venous stasis-induced intra-bone high pressure and hormonal toxicity of bone cells. The above theories also did not clearly prove that the bone cells exhibited necrosis, because no necrosis-specific inflammatory responses cell swelling were found (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Therefore, SANFH lacks effective prevention and early treatment strategies (9) . Previous studies have shown that hormones not only promote the apoptosis of bone cells, osteoblasts and cartilage cells, but are involved in the pathological process of femoral head necrosis (10, 11) . The present study utilized single low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus methylprednisolone (MPS) to establish a rabbit model of SANFH. The roles of levodopa (LEV) in cellular apoptosis were observed in the rabbit model of SANFH, with the aim of providing a basis for the prevention and early treatment of femoral head necrosis.",

Femoral head necrosis was determined according to the pathological features of empty bone lacuna numbers and surrounding necrotic bone marrow tissues. Any region in the slice that was found to exhibit one sign of osteonecrosis was considered to be positive for SANFH. Pathological changes in bone cellular necrosis were expressed as the percentage of empty bone lacunae.

The results revealed that SANFH induced the apoptosis of a large number of bone cells, whereas patients with alcoholism-induced NFH exhibited less apoptotic cells, and no apoptotic cells were detected in the cases of NFH induced by the remaining causes. Therefore, it was concluded that SANFH was induced by the apoptosis of bone cells; however, this study was unable to prove the existence of apoptosis inside the necrotic bone cells of femoral head. Eberhardt et al (14) discovered that large doses of hormones were able to cause changes in cellular viabilities, with apoptosis demonstrated to be the primary change of SANFH. When bone cellular apoptosis was widespread, although blood vessels had no significant change, bone necrosis had already occurred. Calder et al (15) performed an immunohistochemical study of specimens from patients with non-traumatic osteonecrosis, and found that the nitric oxide synthase content was increased, which was considered to be due to the hormone's direct cytotoxic effects, leading to increased nitric oxide and mediating the occurrence of apoptosis. It was suggested that the apoptosis of bone cells has an important role in the pathogenesis of femoral head necrosis. In addition, it was shown that glucocorticoids are able to affect the proliferation and differentiation of bone cells, thus affecting the reconstruction and resorption of bones and decreasing the bone conversion rate, which further leads to osteoporosis, and the deposit of apoptotic bone cells (16) . Glucocorticoids were recognized as one of factors that may contribute cellular apoptosis (17) , thus promoting the apoptosis of osteoblasts and bone cells, leading to the reduction of bone cells. Furthermore, glucocorticoids may also affect the functions of osteoblasts, thus delaying bone formation and resulting in bone loss.",

When LEV enters the central nervous system, it may increase the concentration of dopamine at the median eminence, stimulating dopamine receptors to increase the level of norepinephrine inside the hypothalamus. The latter would then excite the \u03b1-receptor and promote the release of growth hormone releasing factor, leading to the increased secretion of growth hormone (GH). GH is able to promote the synchronic proliferation of proosteoblasts and osteoblasts in fractures and peri-periosteal cambium layer, thus accelerating the repair process of NFH (19) . In addition, GH promotes the secretion of IGF-1 and other factors; IGF-1 is able to promote the synthesis of DNA and RNA in cartilage cells and cell mitosis to accelerate the speed of cartilaginous ossification. Previous in vitro studies have shown that IGF-1 inhibits the apoptosis of bone cells and osteoblasts, inducing the growth and maturation of bones and cartilages, reducing subendosteal bone resorption, increasing the net increase of bone mass, and thereby reducing the incidence of NFH and accelerating the repair process (19) .",
