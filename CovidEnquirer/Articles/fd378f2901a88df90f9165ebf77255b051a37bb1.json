The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, avian influenza H7N9, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and the re-emergence of rabies, brucellosis, and other zoonoses have had a significant effect on the national economy and public health in China, and have affected other countries. Contributing factors that continue to affect emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China include social and environmental factors and microbial evolution, such as population growth, urbanization, deforestation, livestock production, food safety, climate change, and pathogen mutation. The Chinese government has devised new strategies and has taken measures to deal with the challenges of these diseases, including the issuing of laws and regulations, establishment of disease reporting systems, implementation of special projects for major infectious diseases, interdisciplinary and international cooperation, exotic disease surveillance, and health education. These strategies and measures can serve as models for the surveillance and response to continuing threats from emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in other countries.",

            "text": "Economic globalization promotes globalization of capital, technology, labor, and commodities, and also contributes to the globalization of emerging infectious diseases. The world is becoming a global community, and a public health event in one geographic region or nation often affects the health and economy beyond that region, sometimes even globally. China has 34 provincial-level administrative regions and 2856 counties, which are covered by urban and rural health systems. The urban health system comprises hospitals of three different levels, disease control and prevention centers, and health authorities, while the rural health system includes county hospitals, health and epidemic prevention stations, and maternal and child health stations. As China has one fourth of the global population and has close ties with other countries through travel and trade, public health events in the country can have an important impact on distant populations in other countries, and the control of infectious diseases in China implies the control of infectious diseases in the world to a large extent. 1 China is a major contributor to the spread and control of infectious diseases in the world. For example, the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) arose in 2002 in Guangdong, China, and was transmitted to Hong Kong, and then to other countries. 2 The goose/Guangdong/1/1996 H5N1 virus found in a goose farm in southern China in 1996 is considered the precursor of the currently circulating highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in more than 60 countries. 3 Most of these emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, or zoonotic diseases, a group of diseases and infections naturally transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans. These diseases have a negative impact on economic development and human health in both developing and industrial countries. 4 Of the 1415 species documented as pathogenic to humans in 2001, 61% originated from animals or animal products, and 70% of these zoonotic infections originated from wildlife. 5 In this review, we summarize the major emerging and re-emerging zoonoses and contributing factors, and the strategies and measures being used to deal with the challenges of these diseases in China.",

Some SFTS patients have reported that they had seen or been bitten by ticks before the onset of their illness, and Haemaphysalis longicornis has been found infected with SFTSV. 10 Specific antibody to SFTSV antigens has been detected in animals in endemic regions. 11 SFTSV is therefore proposed to be transmitted by contact with animals and/or vectors.",

These factors contribute to emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases related to arthropods and rodents, such as Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever, and epidemic hemorrhagic fever. 49 Urbanization provides opportunities for rural migrants, including higher salaries and improved health conditions. Unfortunately, not all people can find a satisfying job in the city, due to low educational levels and poor professional skills. Because of the commercialization of blood and blood products in China, the sale of plasma by poor people has become a popular way of making a living. 50 The reused needles and inadequately sterile equipment facilitate the transmission of HIV through blood and blood products. 51 Urbanization also promotes population movement and migration. Most people are from rural areas, but work in urban environments, hence regularly travelling between the two sites. Due to financial constraints and overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions, these people are more vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially HIV and viral hepatitis.

Increased temperatures will accelerate the development of mosquitoes. Since mosquitoes lay their eggs in water-filled containers, rainfall often affects larval habitats and vector populations. In some cases, rainfall may change larval habitats and vector populations. Excessive rain can remove habitats through flooding, while limited rainfall may create new habitats, when water in the rivers is drawn into pools to create novel breeding sites for a number of mosquito species during the dry season. 69 A typical example is Schistosomiasis japonicum, whose intermediate host Oncomelania hupensis is usually limited to areas with a mean January temperature of above 0 8C. Due to the increasing temperature, schistosomiasis japonica will be transmitted to nonendemic areas in the north, and the additional risk area is expected to be increased by 783 883 km 2 by 2050, equivalent to 8.1% of the surface area of China. 72 Waterborne infectious diseases are also strongly affected by climate change. During times of drought, water scarcity results in poor sanitation, therefore, many people can be exposed to potentially contaminated water. In contrast, excess rainfall and flooding can also cause epidemics of waterborne infectious diseases, including bacterial and protozoan diarrheal illnesses. 73,74",

This genetic reassortment contributes to newly emerging pathogens of humans and animals, such as the recent emergence of the swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus. 77 The SARS coronavirus HKU1 (CoV HKU1), isolated from patients in Hong Kong from 2003 to 2005, was divided into three clusters: genotypes A, B, and C. However, the phylogenetic analysis of different genomic regions showed that the nucleotide sequences of putative proteins (nsp) 4 to nsp6 of the genotype A strains were clustered with the genotype B strains, while nsp7 and nsp8 and from nsp10 to nsp16 from the genotype A strains were clustered with the genotype C strains, suggesting that genetic recombination between genotypes A and B generated genotype C. 78 This genetic recombination in coronaviruses could easily generate novel coronavirus genotypes or species that could cross host species barriers and cause the emergence of major zoonotic diseases.",

Currently, China has established 350 national monitoring stations and 768 provincial, municipal and county stations or points, which cover the key areas of activities of the vast majority of migratory birds and has effectively prevented the spread of avian influenza by migratory birds. 85 The Ministry of Agriculture has also established a disease reporting system for domestic animals and cross-border animals. 86 The State Council has stressed the need to enforce cooperation and information sharing between ministries and between different levels of government.
