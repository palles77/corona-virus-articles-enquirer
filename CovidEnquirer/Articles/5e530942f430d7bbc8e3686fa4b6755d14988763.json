LATE NEOPLASIA AFTER POLIOMYELITIS SIR,-We report here two cases of spinal-cord tumours 30 years after childhood poliomyelitis. A 34-year-old woman at the age of 4 had had poliomyelitis affecting the lower limbs. Thirty years later she had a retroperitoneal neurogenic (Schwarm cell) sarcoma excised. She died shortly thereafter; necropsy was not performed. In the second patient, a 52-year-old woman, poliomyelitis occurred at age 4 with subsequent partial paralysis of the lower lim~s. At the age of 30 she experienced sudden onset of paraplegia, and at operation a meningioma at DI0 level was removed. The motor paralysis remained but sensation and sphincter control returned to normal.",

Kayser-Gotchalin 3 reported late muscle atrophy many years after poliomyelitis. Many publications refer to the late picture as \"A.L.S.\" rather than poliomyelitis. It is difficult to conceive of tumours causing a poliomyelitis-like picture thirty years before their detection, although spinal-cord tumours have been reported after aseptic meningitis. 4 \u2022 Hopkins and Shield 5 described immunological aspects of poliomyelitis. In children with bronchial asthma, a picture of poliomyelitis has appeared after an acute attack of asthma; the neurological picture here could b~due to a hypersensitivity to drugs, for no pathogen was Isolated. Pietsch and Morris \u2022 found an association between HL-A (especially HL-A 3 and 7) and poliomyelitis: \"this association might represent an association between HL-A and immune response gene determining an immune response to the virus or a product of viral infection of the central nervous system.\" Such an association was found in multiple sclerosis, and perhaps the retiology is similar.
