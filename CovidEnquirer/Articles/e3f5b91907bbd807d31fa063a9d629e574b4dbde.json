            "text": "The yeast Kre2p/Mntlp cxl,2-mannosyltransferase is a type II membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic amino terminus, a membrane-spanning region, and a large catalytic luminal domain containing one N-glycosylation site. Anti-Kre2p/Mntlp antibodies identify a 60-kD integral membrane protein that is progressively N-glycosylated in an MNNl-dependent manner. Kre2p/Mntlp is localized in a Golgi compartment that overlaps with that containing the medial-Golgi mannosyltransferase Mnnlp, and distinct from that including the late Golgi protein Kexlp. To determine which regions of Kre2p/Mntlp are required for Golgi localization, Kre2p/Mntlp mutant proteins were assem-bled by substitution of Kre2p domains with equivalent sequences from the vacuolar proteins DPAP B and Pho8p. Chimeric proteins were tested for correct topology, in vitro and in vivo activity, and were localized intracellularly by indirect immunofluorescence. The resuits demonstrate that the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain is necessary for correct Kre2p Golgi localization whereas, the membrane-spanning and stem domains are dispensable. However, in a test of targeting sufficiency, the presence of the entire Kre2p cytoplasmic tail, plus the transmembrane domain and a 36-amino acid residue luminal stem region was required to localize a Pho8p reporter protein to the yeast Golgi. T HE Golgi apparatus plays a fundamental role in glycan processing and sorting of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. The Golgi apparatus of a typical mammalian cell is composed of a polarized stack of membranous saccules that are differentiated into functionally distinct subcompartments. After the addition of core N-linked sugar moieties in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycoproteins proceed through the cis-Golgi network, the cis-, medial-, and transcisternae, and the trans-Golgi network, where further modifications take place. These include the addition of O-linked sugars and the elaboration, in a protein-specific manner, of complex N-linked carbohydrate structures. The Golgi apparatus also constitutes a major organelle responsible for protein trafficking where particular proteins are directed to precise cellular locations. Two specific Golgi subcompartments have been found to be involved in protein sorting. The cis-Golgi network constitutes the site from which many resident ER proteins are retrieved, and the main function of the TGN is to direct glycoproteins exiting the Golgi complex to either the lysosome or the cell surface (",

In yeast, secretory pathway glycoproteins can acquire two types of N-linked oligosaccharides, either a simple core carbohydrate or one extended by an outer-chain glycan structure. The N-linked core oligosaccharide elaborated in the ER is mainly constituted of MansGlcNAc2 and may undergo Golgi maturation resulting in Man9.13_ GlcNAc2. In other cases, glycoproteins traversing the Golgi apparatus have their core oligosaccharide extended by outer chains (see Fig. 2 ; Ballou, 1990; Herscovics and Orlean, 1993) . The initial step in outer-chain synthesis takes place and defines an early Golgi compartment in which a backbone of ed,6-1inked mannose residues is attached to the core oligosaccharide. This Golgi compartment has been likened to the mammalian cis-Golgi network (Wilsbach and Payne, 1993) . Outer chain elaboration is then brought to completion: the al,6-1inked mannose structure is enlarged in a sequential fashion by al,2-and al,3-mannosyltransferases in a subsequent distinct com-partment defining the yeast medial-Golgi compartment.",

The yeast Golgi complex is not structurally similar to the perinuclear stacked cisternal subcompartments characteristic of the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the yeast Golgi is composed of as many as 30 concave, disklike membranous cisternae scattered in the cytoplasm and most often not organized in parallel stacks (Preuss et al., 1992) . In indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies to different yeast Golgi proteins, the isolated cisternae are visualized as dispersed punctate spots (Franzusoff et al., 1991; Redding et al., 1991; Antebi and Fink, 1992; Cooper and Bussey, 1992; Roberts et al., 1992) . The establishment and maintenance of the polarized organization of the Golgi apparatus relies on the existence of complex sorting and transport mechanisms permitting specific Golgi proteins to be delivered to their precise cisternal destinations. Resident proteins of the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells require particular targeting signals that specify their final location (Pelham and Munro, 1993; Gleeson et al., 1994; Low and Hong, 1994) . Mammalian membrane glycoproteins not possessing positive sorting sequences are transported to the cell surface through a bulk flow of proteins and lipids (Pelham and Munro, 1993) . In yeast, secretory pathway membrane glycoproteins lacking targeting sequences are brought by default to the vacuole (Cooper and Bussey, 1992; Roberts et al., 1992; Wilcox et al., 1992; Nothwehr et al., 1993; Gaynor et al., 1994; Hill and Stevens, 1994) .",

It has been established that the membrane-spanning domain of animal glycosyltransferases plays a central role in Golgi localization (Munro, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Aoki et al., 1992; Burke et al., 1992; Colley et al., 1992; Tang et al., 1992; Teasdale et al., 1992; Wong et al., 1992; Gleeson et al., 1994; Low and Hong, i994) . To define more precisely the S. cerevisiae Golgi complex and to better understand how posttranslational modifications occur, we have studied the glycosyltransferase, Kre2p/Mntlp. KRE2/MNT1 was isolated as a gene implicated in cell-wall assembly conferring K1 killer toxin resistance when mutated (Hill et al., 1992) and found to encode an cd,2-mannosyltransferase (H/iusler and .

In addition, we show that the short NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail domain of Kre2p/Mntlp is required for correct Golgi localization, whereas the membrane-spanning and stem domains are dispensable. However, localization of a reporter protein to the yeast Golgi requires a region of Kre2p/Mntlp encompassing the cytoplasmic tail, the transmembrane domain (TMD), and a segment of the luminal stem domain.",

To identify and subsequently analyze Kre2p, a specific rabbit antiserum was raised, affinity purified, and used to detect antigen-antibody complexes by Western blotting of total-cell protein extracts of yeast strains harboring a KRE2 disruption or containing a KRE2 multicopy plasmid to facilitate immunological detection. The affinity-purified Ab detected Kre2p as a 59-60 kD protein in the KRE2overexpressing strain that was absent from the kre2::TRP1 strain ( Fig. 1 B) , and not detected by preimmune antiserum (data not shown). The in vivo-produced Kre2p is ~8.0 kD larger than the 51.5-kD molecular mass predicted from the D N A sequence. The possible integral membrane protein nature of Kre2p was examined by using reagents extracting cytoplasmic, vesicle-enclosed, and peripheral membrane proteins but leaving intact tightly associated membrane proteins. Ceils expressing KRE2 at high levels were lysed with glass beads and treated with sodium carbonate or urea. After high-speed centrifugation of the treated cell lysates, the distribution of Kre2p in the pellet and supernatant fractions was assessed by Western immunoblotting. As can be seen in Fig. 1 C, Kre2p was found only in membrane pellet fractions.",

Kre2p consists of a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a large carboxy-terminal luminal catalytic domain. The catalytic domain is linked to the transmembrane domain by a polypeptidic \"stem\" region. The stem region is generally thought to be devoid of secondary structure. (B) Immunological detection of Kre2p. Yeast total-protein extracts from kre2::TRP1 in SEY6210 and from the same strain expressing KRE2 from the multicopy plasmid YEp352 (Hill et al., 1986) , were immunoblotted with affinity-purified anti-Kre2p polyclonal antibodies (see Materials and Methods). The molecular mass standards are shown in kilodaltons. (C) Kre2p is membrane associated. SEY6210 cells overexpressing KRE2 were lysed, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting crude homogenate was aliquoted, and fractions were rendered 0.1 M with Na2CO 3 or 1.6 M with urea. After 30 min, each fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h and after SDS-PAGE, Kre2p was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-Kre2p Ab in pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions. least partly due to N-glycosylation, since Kre2p is expected to act in the secretory pathway and the protein possesses a single site for N-glycosyl attachment in its predicted luminal domain (Asna97-Gln-Thr) (see Fig. 6 ). To test for Kre2p N-glycosylation, yeast cells were [35S]methionine labeled in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation. Immunoprecipitation and S D S -P A G E analysis of labeled cell lysates revealed that Kre2p was N-glycosylated (see Fig. 3 , lanes 1 and 2), with the position of the sole N-glycosylation attachment site at A s n 197 being consistent with a type II topology for Kre2p. The molecular mass of Kre2p in the presence of tunicamycin is about 54 kD, still 2.5 kD larger than its pre-dicted molecular mass. The membrane nature of Kre2p or other posttranslational modifications could explain this discrepancy.",

The size of Kre2p produced in a wild-type strain after a 10-min radiolabeling is ~57 kD (major band, lane 2). After an additional 45-min chase, an apparent increase of molecular mass from 57 to ~59-60 kD was seen (Fig. 3 , lanes 2 and 5). This apparent 2-3 kD increase in mass suggests that Kre2p may undergo a post-ER modification not involving extensive outer chain elaboration. The molecular mass of Kre2p produced in an mnn9 strain after a 10-min pulse (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4) and a 45 min chase (lanes 5 and 7) was identical to the mass of Kre2p from a wild-type cell, indicating that Kre2p does not receive an outer chain oligosaccharide. We tested whether the time-dependent additional carbohydrate modification required the MNN1encoded Golgi al,3-mannosyltransferase, an enzyme that acts on both core and outer chains ( Fig. 2 ; Ballou et al., 1990; Graham and Emr, 1991; Graham et al., 1994; Yip et al., 1994) . After a short pulse, Kre2p synthesized in a mnnl strain is approximately of wild-type size (Fig. 3, lane  3) . After a 45-min chase, however, the mnnl-produced Kre2p was ~1-2 kD smaller than the wild-type protein (lanes 5-7) indicating that Kre2p is normally exposed to a Golgi compartment where the Mnnlp cxl,3-mannosyltransferase adds at least three mannose residues to the Kre2p N-glycosyl core. Mnnlp therefore contributes to most of the observed Kre2p post-ER modifications (Fig. 2) . GlcNAc2 carbohydrate structure. In other cases, core structures may be extended by an outer chain of variable size (up to 200 mannose residues) that is composed of a backbone of al,6-mannosyl residues to which are attached branched al,2-and cd,3-mannosyl side chains. Recent evidence suggests that the initiating Ochlp al,6-mannosyltransferase (Nakayama et al., 1992 ) defines a very early Golgi compartment that appears to be distinct from a subsequent early Golgi compartment responsible for cxl,6-mannosyl side chains elongation (Gaynor et al., 1994) . The ~1,2-and al,3mannosyl side chain modifications are predicted to occur in the medial-Golgi. The possible S. cerevisiae N-linked oligosaccharide structures are shown (adapted from Ballou, 1990 and Ballou et al., 1990) . Arrows depict [31,4, al,6, cd,2, and cd,3 linkages between mannoses of the core and outer chain. X = 10 on average. The mannose units not present in the mnn9 mutation are indicated. The Mnnlp-terminal al,3-mannosyltransferase is responsible for the addition of all al,3-mannosyl residues in a medial-Golgi compartment (Ballou, 1990; Graham et al., 1994; Yip et al., 1994) . [] represents mannose residues that are thought to be added to the Kre2p core oligosaccharide in a MNNl-dependent manner (see Fig. 3 ). Fully glycosylated proteins are then transported to a late Golgi compartment which includes the proteolytic enzymes (Kex2p, Kexlp, and DPAP A) responsible for maturation of secreted protein precursors. Glycoproteins that are not retained in the Golgi complex can be subsequently directed to the vacuole through an endosomal compartment or to the cell surface where they can be (a) incorporated into the plasma membrane, (b) secreted and retained in the periplasmic space/cell wall, or (c) secreted extracellularly.

DAP2 encodes the vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (Roberts et al., 1989) , DPAP B, and is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein that lacks apparent vacuolar targeting information. No individual domain of DPAP B was shown to be required for its transport to the vacuole besides a nonspecific hydrophobic TMD (Roberts et al., 1992) . PH08 encodes a vacuolar alkaline phosphatase. It is also a type II membrane protein (Kaneko et al., 1987; Klionsky and Emr, 1989; Nothwehr et al., 1993) that is thought to be transported to the vacuole by default (Nothwehr et al., 1993) . Substitutions designed with vacuolar proteins were used to avoid potential problems with cryptic Golgi-targeting sequences. Indirect immunofluorescence detection of chimeric proteins was undertaken to determine their intracellular location(s).",

They were verified to be membrane associated and properly glycosylated (data not shown), showing that they possess a type II membrane orientation (see Fig. 6 ). In addition, their in vitro and in vivo enzymatic activities were assayed since low levels of mannosyltransferase activity would imply abnormal secondary structure of a particular chimera and possible mislocaliza-tion in the secretory pathway. The in vitro cd,2-mannosyltransferase activity was assayed in cell-membrane fractions. The specific activity of each chimeric protein is displayed in Fig. 9 , where KRE2 expressed in a kre2A strain was arbitrarily determined to be 100%, a value just slightly lower than that of wild-type mannosyltransferase activity from a genomic copy of KRE2. KDKK, KPKK, DKKK, as well as MR/KKK appear to be fully active. KD-K displays intermediate levels of mannosyltransferase activity suggesting that the stem region from position 31 to 66 is necessary for folding or proper catalytic activity.",

K1 killer yeast strains secrete a small pore-forming toxin that requires a cell-wall receptor for function (Bussey, 1991) . KRE2 null mutations lead to shorter mannose chains on cell-wall mannoproreins disrupting the toxin receptor and leading to resistance (Hill et al., 1992; H/~usler et al., 1992) . Yeast cells containing different chimeric proteins were assayed for killer toxin sensitivity and comparisons were made between a sensitive wild-type strain, a resistant kre2 null strain, and the null strain containing plasmids bearing wild-type KRE2 or different chimeric constructions. As can be seen in Fig. 9 , the kre2 null mutant is toxin resistant, showing no killing zone, but the same strain containing the KRE2 gene, or expressing KDKK or KPKK displays a large clear killing zone of ,-~20 mm similar to wild-type cells consistent with correct Golgi localization. Chimeric protein KD-K has also been shown to be localized to the Golgi complex but has a reduced zone size (15 mm) likely a consequence of its reduced mannosyltransferase activity. The reduced killing zone (10 mm) of cells expressing DKKK which has wild-type enzymatic activity in vitro indicates that it is not correctly retained in the Kre2p Golgi subcompartment. MR/KKK has also been shown to be localized to the vacuole, but displays an almost wild-type zone size (17.5 mm). Its catalytic domain appears to have a normal conformation as it possesses wild-type mannosyltransferase activity, but it is partially retained in the ER (see above). Thus, MR/KKK while slowly passing through the secretory pathway en route to the vacuole, is likely able to correctly mannosylate cell-wall proteins.",

However, when the partial stem domain was removed, the majority of the resulting chimeric protein (KKP) was found to be localized in the vacuole. The intracellular localization of chimeric protein KKP was quantitatively scored (see Materials and Methods); 70% of positive cells displayed a vacuolar signal and 26% of the cells had vacuolar and punctate fluorescent signals (typical results are shown in Fig. 10) , whereas 4% showed exclusively punctiform fluorescence. Thus, the Kre2 protein region encompassing the NH2 terminus, TMD, and partial stem domain is sufficient for full Golgi retention of a vacuolar protein. These results were extended biochemically by examining the processing kinetics of both chimeric proteins. The PhoSp alkaline phosphatase is activated in the vacuole (Klionsky and Emr, 1989; Nothwehr et al., 1993) where the catalytic luminal domain is processed by the proteinase A (Ammerer et al., 1986; Woolford et al., 1986) .

Arguing against this view is the demonstration that the NH2-terminal domain of DPAP B is not necessary for vacuolar targeting (Roberts et al., 1992; Nothwehr et al., 1993) . To ensure that mislocalization of DKKK was not caused by some previously unrecognized vacuolar targeting signal of the NH2-terminal domain of DPAP B, chimeric protein MR/KKK was constructed in which the Kre2p cytoplasmic tail was deleted.

As opposed to the results obtained with fusion protein KD-K, all three noncatalytic domains of the Kre2 protein were found to be required for full Golgi retention of the Pho8p luminal region (KKKP). These results are in agreement with those of Chapman and Munro (1994) who found that a fusion protein containing the NHz terminus, the membrane-spanning domain, and a partial stem region of Kre2p linked to a reporter protein was retained in the Golgi complex. The mostly vacuolar localization of KKP demonstrated that the first part of the Kre2p stem region which is not required for retention in the context of a Kre2p catalytic domain (KD-K), is necessary, in combination with the Kre2p cytoplasmic tail and TMD for the targeting of the Pho8p catalytic portion to the Golgi complex (KKKP).

Our results are, however, at variance with conclusions reached in a recent study of Chapman and Munro (1994) and we address this below. In a first set of experiments, Chapman and Munro (1994) tested the role of the Kre2p TMD with a chimeric protein consisting of a full-length fusion of Kre2p/Mntlp linked to the SUC2-encoded invertase by a small region containing a Kex2p-dependent cleavage site (chimeric protein MMMI). The mislocalization of this protein was expected to result in production of soluble invertase when passing through the Kex2p-containing late Golgi compartment. This fusion protein was inferred to be in the Golgi complex as no invertase was secreted from the cell. When the TMD of Kre2p was replaced with that of Pho8p (MPMI) in this protein, it appeared to be mislocalized to some extent, as some invertase was secreted from the cell. This result was interpreted to indicate a role for the Kre2p TMD in Golgi retention. However, the intracellular localization of this chimeric protein was not visualized by immunofluorescence. We replaced the Kre2p TMD in the native protein with two different nonrelated TMD's, and showed that both proteins (KDKK and KPKK) were Golgi localized by using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, we tested that the proteins had the right conformation by measuring their glycosylation in vivo, and their mannosyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo. These proteins (KDKK and KPKK) behaved phenotypically as wild-type Kre2p in our tests with no indication that the Kre2p TMD in the context of a native protein is necessary for proper retention. A possible explanation of the Chapman and Munro (1994) results is that the Kre2p TMD is somehow necessary for Golgi retention in the context of those large heterologous proteins perhaps because some retention property of the luminal domain of Kre2p has been disrupted in the invertase fusion. Unfortunately, the ER retention of chimeric protein KPKP did not permit resolution of this question.",

They inferred from their results that PKP was at least partially localized in the Golgi complex and was retained by the Kre2p TMD. Again, the PKP chimeric protein was not localized intracellularly. This is clearly different from our results with Pho8p chimeras, which show that the Kre2p cytoplasmic NHz-terminal and transmembrane domains (KKP) are not sufficient for proper Golgi retention and the presence of the Kre2p cytoplasmic tail, TMD, and stem region is required for full retention of a Pho8p reporter protein (KKKP) in the yeast Golgi. To resolve this apparent inconsistency, we obtained the PKP construct and, on examination of its cellular location, found that it was exclusively localized to the vacuole displaying no punctiform fluorescence (data not shown). This finding is entirely consistent with our localization results with KKP, and offers no support for the Chapman and Munro conclusion that the Kre2p TMD will at least partially retain a heterologous protein in the yeast Golgi.",

There is no evidence that Kre2p is retained by such a mechanism, since in the series of constructs we have devised, the Kre2p TMD is not implicated in retention. In this lipid interaction model, the length of the membranespanning domain is important for the proper sorting of animal glycosyltransferases (Munro, 1991; Pelham and Munro, 1993) . In the case of KDKK the TMD of DPAP B is three amino acid residues shorter than the Kre2p TMD, and in the case of KPKK the TMD of Pho8p is seven amino acid residues longer than the Kre2p TMD, yet both are retained in the Golgi complex.",

            "text": "None of the studied animal glycosylation enzymes appear to need an intact cytoplasmic domain to achieve Golgi retention (Munro, 1991; Aoki et al., 1992; Colley et al., 1992; Shaper and Shaper, 1992; Teasdale et al., 1992; Dahdal et al., 1993; Burke et al., 1994; Gleeson et al., 1994; Low and Hong, 1994) . Kre2p, thus, constitutes the first demonstration of an eukaryotic glycosyltransferase requiring a short cytoplasmic amino-terminal domain for correct intracellular localization. The 11-amino acid residue-targeting domain of Kre2p seemingly parallels that of the late yeast Golgi enzymes Kexlp, Kex2p and DPAP A (Cooper and Bussey, 1992; Wilcox et al., 1992; Nothwehr et al., 1993) . It was shown for DPAP A that a 10-amino acid region within the cytoplasmic domain was both required and sufficient for proper retention (Nothwehr et al., 1993) , and for Kex2p, a 27-amino acid region was found to be essential (Wilcox et al., 1992) . The accurate Golgi targeting of Kex2p and DPAP A is clathrin dependent and aromatic residues are thought necessary for this retention process (Wilcox et al., 1992; Nothwehr et al., 1993; Wilsbach and Payne, 1993) . While unrelated at a sequence level with Kex2p and DPAP A, the amino-terminal domain of Kre2p contains a single aromatic phenylalanine residue (MALFLS-KRLLR) which was mutated to an alanine, an alteration showing no effect on targeting and, therefore, providing no evidence for clathrin-based retention of Kre2p (Lussier, M., A.-M. Sdicu, T. Ketela, and H. Bussey, unpublished results) .",

Correct retention of Mnnlp is clathrin dependent but, contrary to Kex2p and DPAP A, does not seem to be mediated by a direct interaction through its cytoplasmic tail. The reason for the Kre2p requirement for its cytoplasmic tail remains unclear. It could be clathrin dependent but not involving an aromatic residue, or through some other process. The Gdalp type II Golgi membrane protein (Abeijon et al., 1989; Abeijon el al., 1993) has been shown to be properly localized in a strain lacking clathrin heavy chains (Seeger and Payne, 1992; Wilsbach and Payne, 1993) . The Mnnlp, Kre2p, and Gdalp enzymes appear to be in close proximity or even in the same Golgi compartment (this work; Abeijon et al., 1989; Graham et al., 1994) . This raises the possibility that specific Golgi membrane proteins showing a similar compartmental distribution may be retained by more than one mechanism.",

In contrast, a luminal reporter protein could only be properly retained in the Golgi complex by the Kre2p cytoplasmic tail, plus the membrane-spanning and a 36amino acid residue stem domain (KKKP). The entire Kre2p cytoplasmic tail and membrane-spanning domain were not sufficient to retain Pho8p in the Golgi complex (KKP).

The TMD might not be the sole targeting motif present in particular animal glycosyltransferases as some cytoplasmic and luminal sequences appear to be involved in retention (Munro, 1991; Burke et al., 1992; Shaper and Shaper, 1992; Dahdal et al., 1993; Burke et al., 1994; Gleeson et al., 1994; Low and Hong, 1994) . The trans-Golgi network protein TGN38 appears to achieve proper Golgi localization using two nonoverlapping targeting domains: a tyrosine-based cytoplasmic retrieval signal and a retention signal found in its membrane spanning domain (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993; Ponnambalam et al., 1994) . For the CGN Sed5p syntaxin, the intracellular localization is only partially specified by its TMD and an additional localization signal involving its cytoplasmic domain appears to be involved (Banfield et al., 1994) . Targeting studies on the p63 type II membrane protein indicate that the cytoplasmic, membrane-spanning and luminal domains are all necessary for proper ER-Golgi intermediate compartment localization (Hauri and Schweizer, 1992; Schweizer et al., 1993 Schweizer et al., , 1994 . Finally, the Wbpl type I membrane protein of the yeast ER possesses a cytoplasmic KKXX Golgi-to-ER retrieval motif. When this targeting motif is inactivated, Wbpl is still ER retained indicating that another targeting signal is present in the protein (Gaynor et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "The fact that Kre2p requires more than one topological segment to achieve proper Golgi localization, emphasizes that there may be distinct, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, mechanisms of retention. Golgi proteins that possess a cytoplasmic targeting signal have been proposed to be sorted via a receptor-mediated mechanism (Wilsbach and Payne, 1993; Gleeson et al., 1994; Low and Hong, 1994) . Overexpression of the late Golgi yeast proteins Kexlp, Kex2p, and DPAP A leads to some vacuolar mislocalization, indicating saturation of the capacity of a receptor-based sorting process (Cooper and Bussey, 1992; Wilcox et al., 1992; Nothwehr et al., 1993; Wilsbach and Payne, 1993) . Kre2p overexpression also results in some mistargeting to the vacuole, and could be similarly explained. When wild-type Kre2p is expressed from a 21xbased multicopy vector in a background with mutations in the major vacuolar hydrolases, all positive cells display a punctiform pattern of fluorescence with 15 % of the stained cells also showing vacuolar fluorescence. This small percentage of doubly stained cells are likely expressing high levels of Kre2p as determined by the intensity of the fluorescence. In contrast, overexpression of animal glycosyltransferases does not bring about saturation of the retention mechanism (Munro, 1991; Aoki et al., 1992; Burke et al., 1992; Colley et al., 1992; Teasdale et al., 1992; Gleeson et al., 1994) . Interpreting our data in the simplest way, the Kre2p segment encompassing the NH 2 terminus along with the TMD and stem region could interact directly with a medial-Golgi localized receptor spanning both sides of the Golgi lipid bilayer. For Kre2p to be retained in the Golgi, an interaction between the putative receptor and the NH2-terminal domain is essential. Part of the presumed Kre2p receptor complex could be part of the Golgi extracisternal space matrix which in mammals was recently shown to bind medial-Golgi enzymes presumably through their cytoplasmic tails . Interestingly, examination of the cytoplasmic NHz-terminal domains of the six members of the KRE2 mannosyltransferase family (Lussier et al., 1993; Mallet et al., 1994) reveals that the Kre2p (MALFLSKRLLR) sequence resembles only that of Ktr4p (MRFLSKRILK; Mallet et al., 1994) where the sequence FLSKR(I/L)L(K/R) is conserved in both enzymes. This may imply a common recep-tor for the two proteins. Interaction of the presumed receptor protein with a chimeric construct lacking the Kre2p stem domain but including a reporter luminal domain (KKP) may be partial, and insufficient to retain the fusion protein in the Golgi complex. To achieve full Golgi retention of a reporter luminal protein, interaction of the postulated receptor with the three nonenzymatic domains would be required.",

It has been proposed that protein oligomers are assembled through their TMD and/or luminal domains in a particular Golgi cisternae and because of their highorder structure are consequently excluded from entering forward-moving secretory vesicles (Weisz et al., 1993; Gleeson et al., 1994; Low and Hong, 1994; Nilsson et al., 1994; Schweizer et al., 1994; Yamaguchi and Fukuda, 1995) . Applying such a model to a functionally active Kre2 protein involves self-association or formation of heterooligomers between Kre2p and other medial-Golgi protein(s) either through the catalytic domain or possibly with some contiguous stem sequences retained in construct",

            "text": "Overall, our results suggest that proper targeting of Kre2p in the yeast medial-Golgi may involve two different mechanisms. The saturability of the Kre2p retention system implies a receptor-based retention mechanism that could involve protein-protein interactions over a tail/TMD/ partial stem region. In addition, a second mechanism that may involve oligomerization would operate in some way through the Kre2p luminal domain. In conclusion, our observations on Kre2p targeting may point to differences in Golgi localization mechanisms between yeast and animal glycosyltransferases or could indicate that multiple retention or retrieval mechanisms are used to varying extents in both systems.",
