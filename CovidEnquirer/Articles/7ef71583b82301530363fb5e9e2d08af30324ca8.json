            "text": "This paper proposes a conceptual model for understanding emerging changes in a North American labour union. UNITE-HERE, largely representing textile and hospitality workers, has been at the forefront of debates on union revitalization in the US and Canada. UNITE-HERE is often characterized as a successful example of North American union renewal, but I argue that this often oversimplifies many complex and contradictory labour strategies. Much of the labour union renewal literature remains prescriptive and is only beginning to escape false binaries such as business versus social unionism, the servicing versus organizing model, or 'top-down' versus 'bottom-up' administration. In this paper, I attempt to conceptualize the strategies adopted by the union as they exist in relation to the changing political economic landscape. I characterize the current labour practices as 'Schumpeterian unionism', a model which captures the shifting, contradictory, and multi-scalar relationships labour has with the broader community, capital and the state. The model is illustrated with a case study of UNITE-HERE Local 75's response to the 2003 SARS outbreak through their establishment of a Hospitality Workers Resource Centre to service unemployed workers.",

            "text": "For over two decades, economic restructuring in advanced capitalist economies has challenged organized labour and with the rare exception of a few northern European countries, labour union density in many advanced capitalist economies has been in a prolonged period of stagnation or decline (Moody, 1997; Fantasia and Voss, 2004; Visser, 2006) . In Canada, the percentage of workers covered by unions is double that of the United States but has slowly declined to less than a third of the labour force (Akyeampong, 2004) . The central question for many labour activists and researchers continues to be how labour can revitalize itself to maintain a capacity to shape economic landscapes. There has been no shortage of commentary on these questions as an entire literature on labour union renewal has been dedicated to the project for well over a decade (Bronfenbrenner, 2003; Fairbrother and Yates, 2003; Kumar and Schenk, 2006) . Geographers have also weighed in on these debates, although the approach has focussed largely on the question of the how labour can (re)organize at scales compatible to that of contemporary capital (Herod, 1998 (Herod, , 2001 Castree et al., 2004; Tufts, 2007a) .",

This departure is antithetical to the narrow 'bread and butter' business unionism which typified much of the post-war compromise industrial relations in Anglo-American economies. Even the staunchest advocates of social movement unionism, however, recognize it remains an ideal rather than actual practice. Moody (2007, p. 237) argues that social movement unionism has lost much of its 'unique meaning' as it now refers to any effort where the union reaches out to the community in an issue based campaign. For this reason, Kumar and Murray (2006) speak of 'social unionism' as a midway point between business and social movement unionism to characterize unions who adopt some of the more innovative strategies, but remain very much integrated into capitalist production.",

I argue that many of the labour renewal strategies currently observed can be interpreted as not only a reaction to, but also constitutive of neoliberalism and the re-scaling of capital and the state (see Jessop, 2002; Brenner, 2004) . As an entry point into this discussion, the paper proposes a model of 'Schumpeterian unionism' juxtaposing the ideal-types of 'defensive Atlantic unionism' and 'ideal renewed social movement unionism'. I compare four areas of union activity: intra-institutional organizing; extra-institutional organi-zation; labour-management relations; and labour-state relations. Here, Schumpeterian unionism is defined as a model of labour organization that preserves working-class agency by adapting to successive rounds of economic 'creative destruction' (see Peck and Jones, 1994) . In keeping with traditional Marxist interpretations of trade unionism, these practices are neither transformative nor revolutionary, but they may sustain labour as a viable economic agent within harsher variants of neoliberalism.",

            "text": "Aside from the labour union renewal literature itself, the conceptual framework is developed from two sources. Its first theoretical inspiration is largely drawn from Jessop's (2002) political economy of evolving capital-state relations. In a groundbreaking article, Jessop (1993) forwarded the Schumpeterian workfare state (SWS) as a model of state-capital relations displacing the Keynesian Welfare State established in post-War Atlantic Fordist economies. At its core, the SWS model characterized a number of national policies aimed at implementing the neoliberal project (e.g., labour market flexibility, innovation). The SWS model is inspired by Schumpeter's (1942, p. 83 ) treatise on economic evolution that centred the process of 'creative destruction' as 'the essential fact about capitalism' that must be understood in order to understand overall economic development. Over a decade, Jessop (2002) refined his initial model to where he speaks of Schumpeterian Workfare Post-national Regimes (SWPR) as the successor to the Keynesian state. The SWPR's focus is on: economic policies which increase competitiveness in global markets; downward pressure on social wages with limited welfare; the rise of networks of public-private governance; and re-scaled state policy above and below the nation. From a geographical viewpoint, the most significant evolution of Jessop's model is the integration of how capitalist states re-scale economic policy to global (e.g., policies allowing capital to flow to low wage regions) and sub-national levels (e.g., policies enhancing regional metropolitan competitiveness rather than national economic development). Indeed, it was the initial aspatiality of Jessop's model that inspired a number of geographers to explore how restructuring of the welfare state was being played out across space at different scales (see Peck, 1996 Peck, , 2001 . Brenner (2004) has built upon Jessop's work to define how the re-territorialization of state policies from the national-global and national-local has created a number of contradictory new state spaces. In particular, national policy supporting cities and the decentralization of power has shifted the governance and reconfigured state-capital formations toward the urban. It is the re-territorialization of the state to a number of scales which have proliferated the variations of neoliberalisms on the ground and requires researchers to now look at neoliberal policies as they 'actually exist' (Brenner and Theodore, 2002) .",

For labour unions, the implications of these policies must not be understated as they shape the quantity and quality of jobs delivered by capital and in some cases, challenge the rights of workers to organize effectively (Panitch and Swartz, 2003; Fantasia and Voss, 2004) . While in most cases organized labour has been the target of SWPRs, it is problematic to conceptualize labour as outside processes shaping variations of capitalist states. Another approach is to explore how organized labour is changing in response to shifting policies of SWPR and how these responses are in many cases enabling neoliberal state projects operating at multiple scales. While many emergent labour union renewal strategies can still be discussed as a reaction to neoliberal restructuring and the regulatory environment imposed by SWPRs, other emerging union structures and practices can also be viewed as an integral part of contemporary capitalist economies. In other words, it is consistent to consider how unions are implicated in various formations of neoliberal regimes since Schumpeterian economies will inevitably require the consent of Schumpeterian labour. It is within this theoretical framework, that the following discussion of labour union renewal is situated. Second, the model has been conceptualized through its grounding in a larger empirical project on hospitality sector unionism in Toronto, specifically the experience of UNITE-HERE Local 75 (see Tufts, 2003 Tufts, , 2004 Tufts, , 2006 Tufts, , 2007a Tufts, , 2007b . While a number of campaigns and initiatives of Local 75 may be characterized as Schumpeterian unionism, here I present an examination of the unions response to the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto which adversely affected the city's hospitality sector. The specific case study is the Hospitality Workers Resource Centre (HWRC), a service developed as a response to workers displaced from work by the crisis. The case study demonstrates how the choices unions make can contribute to neoliberal agendas while simultaneously reproducing labour as viable institutions. Further, it demonstrates how 'Schumpeterian' unions are rescaling their strategies in the midst of global challenges. Grounded theoretical approaches are a huge strength of contemporary economic geography (see Yeung, 1997) and any new theoretical work must remain grounded in real political circumstances of workers' lives. Abstracting organized labour's practices too far from the realities of everyday political struggles leads to analyses which are far removed from unionism as it 'actually exists'. Following an elaboration and definition of Schumpeterian unionism, I present Local 75's response to the SARS outbreak to exemplify the model. I conclude with some broader implications for the model with respect to union renewal and the broader labour geography project.",

For example, Fletcher and Hurd (1998) recognized the limits of juxtaposing servicing versus organizing in discussions of union renewal almost from the initial conception. Many studies of labour union renewal also remain largely prescriptive and often 'idealize' labour transformation as an antithesis to the stagnant and defensive actions of retrenched business unionism. As a result, labour union renewal as it 'actually exists' remains hidden as the emphasis is on capacities to achieve an ideal form, such as a renewed social movement unionism. Labour union renewal, however, contains both complex and contradictory processes with uneven outcomes. In some instances, so-called 'renewed' unionism actually aids the neoliberal project while actions deemed 'business as usual' unionism may forestall its advancement. I address these contradictions by introducing the concept of 'Schumpeterian unionism' as one way of characterizing the current transformation of segments of Anglo-American labour movements.",

A renewed social movement unionism calls for more intensive organizing strategies (e.g., house calls to new members) that built solidarity for long-term struggle against capital (see Bronfenbrenner, 2003) . Further, an ideal renewed unionism is not an abandonment of servicing members. Instead, such renewed unionism calls for new approaches to servicing that allow workers to self-organize against an employer through mu-tual-aid (see Bacharach et al., 2001) and shift any surplus resources created by greater membership participation to organizing new members within and beyond traditional industrial relations frameworks into a broader labour movement (e.g., representing workers by pressuring employers prior to any formal certification).",

Instead, organizing campaigns are strategic and specific targets are identified. Servicing by paid staff is not abandoned, but collective bargaining efficiencies are developed and linked to organizing. For example, collective bargaining is used to exert demands for greater employer recognition of unions and to facilitate organizing (e.g., neutrality agreements with employers). Most important, campaigns and bargaining are increasingly multi-scalar as local initiatives are linked to global struggles in complex ways. Geographers have contributed their own theoretical and empirically assertions as debates are largely focussed on the appropriate scale to organize workers (see Tufts, 2007a Tufts, , 2007b Sadler and Fagan, 2004) . As Savage (2006, p. 650) succinctly notes, however, the mechanisms creating multiple scales of organizing are rarely painless transitions:",

In contrast, the success of recruiting and building power over employers is often directly linked to union engagement with other labour and non-labour organizations in order to build a broad 'social movement unionism' around diverse communities. Again, such broad-based multi-issue coalitions are rarely achieved. And while 'Global Unions' are deemed crucial for organizing large scale neoliberal transnational employers such as Wal-Mart (see Bronfenbrenner, 2007; Gordon and Turner, 2000) , transferring resources to institutions which can negotiate and enforce effective global agreements with employers remains a challenge (Stevis and Boswell, 2007) . The power of national and sub-national central labour bodies to marshal resources from several unions is uneven as national labour movements differ in history and structure. In the case of the US, there are now two national central labour bodies following the split of the Change to Win coalition from the AFL-CIO in 2005, creating greater, if temporary, solidarity among some unions and divisions among others. 1 Schumpeterian unions' approach to extra-local organizing is much more flexible and contingent on specific challenges. First, all unions exercise caution when entering coalitions. It is better to characterize many of these relationships as ephemeral coalitions rather than a sustainable community unionism (see Tufts, 1998; Wills and Simms, 2004) . These alliances are often campaign specific and labour's superior financial and political power is not easily surrendered to create equal coalitions (see Tattersall, 2005) .",

Schumpeterian unions only reimagine the role of such institutions in terms of what they can offer to multi-scalar campaigns and practices. Cooperative organizing campaigns, the mediation of jurisdictional disputes, and the economies of scale gained through joint lobbying and educational efforts are part of this re-imagined but still limited role for central labour bodies.

A more balanced approach to the question of mergers explains these developments in terms of unions seeking to increase their strategic capacity to organize in new sectors (see Yates and Ewer, 1997) . In the case of UNITE-HERE's 2004 troubled merger, the financial resources of one union in a declining sector (i.e., UNITE) combined with a poor union established in a growing sector (i.e., HERE) to increase the capacity to organize workers in immigrant communities.

Schumpeterian unions, however, do continue to cooperate with employers on a daily basis, but the relationship is better characterized as one of 'limited trust' where cooperation is often ephemeral and lent for competitive support under specific conditions. Recent research in the Canadian auto sector has found that unions play a role in facilitating information flows among competing firms within 'clusters' suggesting that restructuring through outsourcing to non-union firms can impede such knowledge transfer (Rutherford and Holmes, 2007) . Some unions have adopted strategies which engage new labour-management partnerships as new trade-offs are made between increasing productivity and maintaining job security. 'Social partnerships' are argued to strengthen labour's position by 'trapping' capital investment in local markets through 'high road' strategies that emphasize training and increased productivity in the workplace (Kelly, 2004) .

Economic development strategies often found labour and the state in a tight tri-partite relationship with local capital to attract international investment through civic boosterism (Harvey, 1989; Hudson and Sadler, 1986) . Union leadership was also implicated in the coercive management of dissent against neoliberal states' restructuring of social contracts as they (paternalistically) defended against capital flight. At the same time, labour surrendered labour market regulation exclusively to the state, failing to organize workers outside of industrial relations regimes which were increasingly hostile to union expansion (Panitch and Swartz, 2003 ). An ideal renewed social movement unionism emphasized greater social democratic control over investment decisions which will better manage industrial (over) capacity and the creative destruction process. Further, social movement unionism defines union membership in broad terms which are centred on the needs of workers in the margins rather than exclusive formal membership. For example, the Living-Wage Campaigns which emerged in the 1990s in the de-industrialized US, pressured the state and employers to improve working standards for all workers in specified low-wage sectors, not only unionized workers (Luce, 2004) .",

Second, Schumpeterian unions are engaged in a process of seeking out and exploiting new state spaces created by the re-territorialization of states in an increasingly global economy (Brenner, 2004) . Such unions re-territorialize their relationship with the state, increasingly to the local level as they look to identify the new points of leverage created by re-scaled state accumulation strategies. For example, Schumpeterian unions are perhaps less concerned with national electoral politics and more concerned with finding new ways to exploit the slippages created when states download responsibilities to scales such as the urban. For unions such as UNITE-HERE, participation in Left political parties at the national and sub-national scale is not abandoned, but there is encouragement to build relationships with municipal politicians (Left and Right) to influence processes such as urban development.",

The most noted of these were: financial difficulties ranging from the accumulation of debt to eviction; stress associated with re-entry into the job market and changing companies and/or occupations (e.g., interview anxiety); and increased work in other jobs (e.g., two or more part-time low wage jobs as a substitute for lost hospitality employment). Second, when workers did return to hotels (often on a parttime basis) there was significant restructuring of work which included: intensified workloads as employers were hesitant to restore employment levels to pre-SARS levels; new flexible work arrangements including multi-tasking and the performance of front-line work by administrative staff; and extended period of reduced work hours.

            "text": "For the most part the Canadian federal government limited its response to the tourism crisis to a series of sponsored events and marketing initiatives aimed to boost the industry (Table 4) . Very little was provided in terms of direct relief, but funding was eventually secured for a drop-in centre to assist struggling hospitality workers, largely through co-funding sources from municipal, provincial and federal sources. As the outbreak unfolded in March 2003, immediate discussions were held among Local 75, employers and Tourism Toronto. At the beginning of the crisis, the union and the industry were able to find a common ground with respect to the need to find assistance for hospitality workers, specifically those in the accommodation sector. It was realized that the structure of the Employment Insurance program would simply not allow many casual and seasonal workers to weather the crisis given that benefits collected in the slow winter months would soon expire. Other forms of assistance would be needed. In order to lobby effectively for government support joint labour-management efforts would be necessary. In the words of one board member, ''We pretty much came to a meeting of the minds that the industry and the union had to work together here to assist employees.\" In May 2003, the union involved the Metro Labour Education Centre (MLEC), a labour friendly and administered training service, in the proposal process for a resource centre. In June and July, informal discussions were held with all three levels of government and by August a submission of a proposal and meeting was held with Jane Stewart, then Minister of Human Resources. In September-October 2003, negotiations with all three levels of government were held and a Labour Market Adjustment Program (LMAP) contract was signed with the HWRC, a local tri-partite service administered by government, employers and the union. In November space was procured, staff recruited and services developed. In January 2004, HWRC was in full operation (a full 9 months after the crisis began). The centre received approximately 4500 visits in 8 months of operation prior to its abrupt closure on October 31, 2004 (see timeline in Table 5 ).",

The vision of the centre was to offer a comprehensive range of services for temporally unemployed and underemployed workers. This differed significantly from many labour market adjustment programs aimed at retraining permanently displaced workers for new careers. As stated by a founding board member, ''There's everything. The mental health, the wellness, the financial, the personal, the vocational, the training piece-it's all there and that's the way an adjustment process should be run.\" Members experiencing the pressures of unemployment also appreciated the more holistic approach. When asked which services were most beneficial, clients most often referred to the support services. The availability of emotional support was considered just as important referral services to food and rent banks. For those who stated job search services were most important, the ability to receive assistance with resume writing in English and internet access were particularly valued. Interview participants who ranked vocational training as the most important did find English language training and computer classes useful. In analysing the interview transcripts the inability of respondents to list just one service as the 'most beneficial' reveals an important aspect of HWRC's integrative servicing model. It is the ability to receive a range of services in one location provided by peers who understand the sector and the impact of the SARS crisis was deeply valued.",

There were, however, a small number of clients from Mississauga, Brampton and other Greater Toronto Area municipalities. Of those clients reporting their age, over half (55.9%) were under the age of 40. Given seniority rules in the accommodation sector, it is not surprising that younger workers were the first to become unemployed. At the same, time the presence of a large number of older workers seeking assistance (18.9% were over 50), reveals the extent of the crisis. The client profile does indicate that HWRC did manage to reach the most marginal segments of the hospitality labour market. For example, room attendants (almost entirely immigrant women) were the largest group of clients seeking assistance from HWRC. The centre's focus on younger workers and women occupying the lowest paying jobs in the sector must be considered an important part of the centre's rationale and success.",

Employers may have anxiety toward any integration of union education (e.g., workers' rights, shop steward training) into hospitality service training programs. Employers have resisted union attempts to gain control over training in other sectors for similar reasons. In the case of the hospitality sector, any union control over job placement services, such as the establishment of a 'clearing-house' for unemployed workers seeking to be matched with industry postings may appear to employers as efforts to establish a local 'hiring-hall' giving unions control over labour supply.",

The Toronto and York Region Labour Council also supported displaced workers. The experience of low-wage workers became central to the labour council's 'A Million Reasons' campaign calling for an overall increase in the minimum wage. The council later initiated 'A Million Reasons to Support Hotel Workers' campaign as it supported UNITE-HERE in its 2006 round of bargaining which attempted to establish North American agreements with specific companies (see Tufts, 2007a) . Local 75, networked with other locals through its international union, used these networks as it formulated what such a centre might look like over the longer-term (i.e., a Las Vegas style union culinary training institute). There were, however, some limits to extra-institutional organizing efforts. Other unions, historically competitive with UNITE-HERE, representing smaller numbers of workers in the sector did not lead or participate in the HWRC project. Further, there was some tension at the national scale as a committee of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) examining Employment Insurance reform was wary of UNITE-HERE's call for special extensions for hospitality workers as this contradicted the CLC's position of broad reforms which would restore accessibility and higher benefits to all workers, a goal more typical of social movement unionism.",

For the first time, hospitality workers made their demands known to the state which is much more experienced in responding to demands for intervention by industrial unions. For example, during HWRC's operation, the Canadian and Ontario government announced a joint 20% subsidy of Ford's $818 million flexible re-tooling of its Windsor assembly plant (Lyne, 2004) . Such subsidies (which have only grown in the wake of the collapse of the North American auto sector) are largely facilitated through the joint lobbying efforts of powerful multinational corporations and industrial unions (e.g., the Canadian Auto Workers). Such large scale, long-term support for hospitality workers was not secured and the tri-partite HWRC was largely a temporary measure. However, Local 75 did manage to exploit the new state spaces created as nation states re-territorialize their accumulation strategies at the urban scale. As states centre economic development strategies around 'creative cities' with well-developed consumer service economies (Florida, 2002) , they must address crises which threaten those related sectors. The investment made by the Canadian state in terms of stimulating tourism activity and the (relatively limited) support given to hospitality workers is evidence of re-scaled policy. Re-territorialization presents urban service workers, who have been largely ignored, with new spaces to secure state subsidies. In return for this state support, the union will play a role in regulating the labour market by managing dissent by providing material gains and sectoral based training for marginalized workers who are increasingly central to urban accumulation strategies. 3 The Culinary Training Academy in Las Vegas is a labour-management partnership which trains adults for the Las Vegas hospitality industry. It is funded through government grants, fee for service training programs and a special contribution fund negotiated among Las Vegas hotel properties and the members of Culinary Union Local 226 and Bartenders Local 165 (UNITE-HERE affiliated locals). The academy provides training for new entry level workers and incumbent workers through skills upgrading. Facilities include 'mock' hotel suites and an onsite restaurant.",

Given that the model is partially grounded in the examination of UNITE-HERE's response to the SARS crisis, it is only expected that the case study illuminates the model (as it was designed). Like all models, grounded or not in specific empirical cases, there are limits to general application. But the framework is an entry point to greater understanding of labour's relationship with neoliberal capital and states. It is itself, an ideal-type which is meant to better capture some broad changes in organized labour which remain far removed from other idealized-types of unionism. With other cases, there will be other 'ideal-types' of Schumpeterian unionism that vary over space and time. It is, however, a framework for the investigation of other labour union responses which respond to, and in many cases enable, economic and political change that is theoretically and empirically located between other reductive and normative models.",

            "text": "There are, however, political and theoretical implications of emergent Schumpeterian unionism(s). Politically, in the case of UNITE-HERE, there are limits to its Schumpeterian unionism as practiced. While UNITE-HERE in general, and Local 75 specifically, have been viewed as successful examples of union renewal (see Schenk, 2005) , it is inaccurate to characterize these efforts as any significant movement toward social movement unionism. Instead, union strategies reflect a re-territorialized neoliberal economy and state as they actually exist on the ground. The experience with HWRC did create a space for Local 75 to engage with the state and begin to consider new spaces in which it can shape the development of the accommodation sector in Toronto. The union is, however, participating in the creative destruction process as it advocates turning crises into a skills upgrading opportunity. While this is common, the local and sector specific nature of the union's demands in this case limit broader social reforms and even the possibility of a shift toward a movement based unionism. UNITE-HERE's proposal of limited reforms to address the crisis is in keeping with the neoliberal state's transition away from universal welfare provisions. In the end, these demands for relatively small reforms were not even met and the limited funding for the HWRC was a small investment for the state. Establishing a program that fosters flexibility and shifts the responsibility to adapt to crises to workers is simply a variant of neoliberal labour market policy. While the HWRC had some success, it was largely localized resistance. Instead of arguing for broad changes or 'why can't Canada be more like Sweden?', the union settled for 'why can't Toronto be more like Las Vegas?' Such a Schumpeterian approach by UNITE-HERE is expected given that the strategic potential to (re)regulate the local labour market through such a centre and the new spaces for engagement created by the re-scaling of state economic development strategies. Such strategies are, however, unlikely to inspire a mass social movement needed for economic transformation (or even much needed national employment insurance reform). At best, unions can engage new state spaces and the contradictions of urban accumulation and even improve the lives of working people in specific sectors and places, but the dominant economic system is inevitably reproduced.",

            "text": "Theoretically, Schumpeterian unionism raises many questions and there are some implications with respect to the production of scale, the agency of labour in capital-state relations, and the broader labour geography project. First, a key aspect of Schumpeterian unionism emphasized here is the multi-scalarity of union renewal efforts. Schumpeterian unions do not recognize the primacy of any one particular scale, but instead focus on how different scales of worker mobilization or state control can be engaged with to the advantage of workers. In their analysis of the SARS outbreak, Keil and Ali (2007) argue that the same global connectivity which allowed the disease to spread so quickly also allowed international health care professionals to share information and transcended the limits of national based health care systems. Similarly, as the epidemic displaced hospitality workers from Toronto's migrant and racialized communities, the union similarly marshalled action beyond and below the nation state, soliciting local support to federal officials and integrating 'high road partnerships' practiced in other countries. As Ward (2007, p. 273 ) reminds us ''. . .the importance of acting at certain scales is always relative and contingent. It does not necessarily become more or less important in the move from the local to the global or from the global to the local.\" As a concept, Schumpeterian unionism captures this fluidity and emphasizes how different scales of worker action and engagement conflict with and strengthen each other.",

Such an interpretation, however, would conflate the theorization of how workers are producing scale with theorization of the relative importance of particular scales. Schumpeterian unions are engaging with the city as a means of leveraging local power, but this does not mean that the nation state or national scale remain unimportant in analyses. In the case of Local 75, the HWRC was a local initiative that engaged the federal government as a key funder and highlighted the inadequacies of the current national employment insurance program. Indeed, further research is required to examine what happens when local Schumpeterian unionism conflicts with other scales of organized labour (e.g., international head offices, central labour bodies) which are more reflective of defensive or social movement unionism.",

An underdeveloped theme in the literature influenced by Jessop's SWPR framework is the role organized labour plays in not only challenging but facilitating neoliberal transitions. The HWRC case and the consequent campaign for 'high road' partnerships regulating the local labour market are not incompatible with national economic development strategies which foster urban competitiveness. Over the longer-term, Local 75's Schumpeterian unionism may increase the power of the union and even increase standards for workers while enhancing the overall competitiveness of Toronto (and Canada's) tourism and hospitality industry. Labour geography is capable of producing more in-depth models which embed labour union transformation in broader processes of capital-state re-territorialization.",

            "text": "Lastly, there is a broader theoretical implication of the above approach to understanding labour union renewal for the broader labour geography project. Indeed, Schumpeterian unionism does integrate significant agency for labour as it addresses broader questions of political-economy. In a recent keynote conference presentation, Wills (2009) differentiated labour geography, a project which emphasizes the agency of workers and their institutions in producing economic landscapes (see also Castree, 2007; Lier, 2007) , from other research on changing labour markets and relations which focus on oppressive capitalist structures which she defines as the political economy of work. The above conceptualization of Schumpeterian unionism may be taken as an example of how labour geography might contribute to broader discussions of labour union renewal and the political economy of work. Further, it is an example of how capital-state theory might inform labour geography. If labour geography is to flourish as a viable sub-discipline it will inevitably have to engage with a variety of literatures and approaches to labour studies. Excavating labour agency will remain central to the project, but rigidly applying an agency (an elusive and chaotic concept) litmus test to define the discipline may prematurely isolate labour geography from other research on work. As labour geographers interested in the emancipatory potential of our research and the power of labour, we must take every opportunity to understand the changing political and economic conditions confronting workers.",
