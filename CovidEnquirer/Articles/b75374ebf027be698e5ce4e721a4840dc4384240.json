            "text": "Interferon beta (IFN\u03b2) is an antiviral and immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). [1\u22125] In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, IFN\u03b2 therapy has been shown to reduce relapse rate and brain lesion development in patients with relapsing forms of MS. [2, 4] Indeed, a subcutaneous (sc) formulation of IFN\u03b2-1a (Rebif \u00ae ; Merck Serono S.A., Geneva, Switzerland) administered three times weekly (tiw) and an intramuscular (im) formulation of IFN\u03b2-1a (Avonex \u00ae ; Biogen Idec/Elan, Cambridge, MA, USA) administered once weekly have also been shown to delay the progression of physical disability in patients with relapsing forms of MS. [6\u22128] Three formulations of IFN\u03b2 are currently approved in the USA for treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS: IFN\u03b2-1a 22 \u03bcg or 44 \u03bcg sc tiw (Rebif; original formulation, which is referred to in this article as IFN\u03b2-1a sc), IFN\u03b2-1a 30 \u03bcg administered im once weekly (Avonex), and IFN\u03b2-1b 250 \u03bcg sc administered every other day (Betaseron \u00ae /Betaferon \u00ae ; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ, USA; Extavia \u00ae , Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA). The response to IFN\u03b2 therapy can vary with the type of preparation, and may be impacted by drug formulation, dosing regimen, and route of administration. [1, 9, 10] For example, head-to-head comparisons of different IFN\u03b2 formulations demonstrated that higher and more frequent doses of IFN\u03b2 had greater efficacy compared with lower, less frequent dosing regimens (of a different IFN\u03b2 formulation) for the treatment of relapsing MS. [2,11\u221213] Treatment with IFN\u03b2 in patients with relapsing MS has been associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). [14\u221217] Although the full clinical impact of these anti-IFN antibodies is not completely known, the presence of high titers of NAbs to IFN\u03b2 can reduce the therapeutic effects of treatment. [18] [19] [20] A new sc formulation of IFN\u03b2-1a (Rebif New Formulation [NF]; Merck, Bari, Italy) that is produced without fetal bovine serum and without human serum albumin as an excipient, with the goals of improving injection tolerability and reducing immunogenicity, was developed. [21, 22] In vivo administration of IFN\u03b2-1a sc NF in a mouse model has suggested a slower and weaker development of NAbs compared with IFN\u03b2-1a sc. [23] Biologic activity assessed from in vitro assays can supplement in vivo data, thereby helping to fully characterize a particular therapeutic agent. Evidence from previous studies indicates that the antiviral and biologic activity of IFN\u03b2 may vary among different formulations. [1, 10] Specific measures of IFN\u03b2 biologic activity include the inhibition of viral replication and the enhanced expression of mRNAs that are induced by IFN\u03b2. The objective of the current in vitro study was to compare the antiviral and IFN\u03b2-stimulated gene (ISG) expression activity of IFN\u03b2-1a sc NF with that of the original IFN\u03b2-1a sc formulation; IFN\u03b2-1b sc was used as an additional comparator.",

A549 cells (Zooprophylactic Institute, Brescia, Italy) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (D-MEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Sial, Rome, Italy), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sial), 50 \u03bcg/mL of gentamycin (Sial), and 25 mM of Hepes buffer solution (Sial). Cells were seeded at 3 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well in 96-well plates (Falcon TM , Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ, USA), and after 24 hr, triplicate cell cultures were incubated with serial dilutions of each of the IFN\u03b2 formulations for 18-20 hr. In each test, 12 wells were filled with 0.1 mL of medium to serve as both virus and cell control. A549 cell monolayers were then washed with D-MEM, and both IFN-treated and control viruses were inoculated with VSV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose)/cell. After adsorption at 37 \u2022 C for 1 hr, the excess virus inoculum was removed, the cell monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and wells were filled with complete medium to a total volume of 0.1 mL/well. Infection with VSV was allowed to progress for 24 hr according to the time required for the specific cytopathic effects to become clearly visible by optical microscopy. Culture supernatants were then collected, and titration of VSV was carried out in L929 mouse fibroblast cells (Zooprophylactic Institute). L929 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with 10% FCS (Sial), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sial), and 50 \u03bcg/mL of gentamycin (Sial). Titration of VSV was performed by determination of the TCID 50 /mL, according to the method of Reed and Muench. [25] A series of three-fold dilutions of the VSV inocula were added to L929 cell monolayers, and were incubated for 24 hr in order to detect VSV-induced CPE. The cell monolayers were then stained with crystal violet in 20% ethanol. The dye taken up by the cells was eluted with 33% acetic acid, and its absorbance measured at 540 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplate reader (Varioskan \u00ae Flash Spectral Scanning Multimode Reader, Thermo Fischer, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).",

Results of these analyses were expressed in terms of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) calculated in International Units (IU)/mL and in ng/mL when the specific activities of the different IFN\u03b2 formulations were considered. The specific activities used were 32 MIU/mg for IFN\u03b2-1b sc and 270 MIU/mg for IFN\u03b2-1a sc. These specific activity values were provided by the manufacturers, and were obtained by comparing the antiviral activity of the IFN\u03b2 formulations to the World Health Organization (WHO) reference standard of recombinant human IFN\u03b2. [26] Furthermore, the antiviral activities of each IFN\u03b2 formulation were also compared by measuring the VSV yield reductions in A549 cells treated with 10 and 100 times the IC 50 of each IFN\u03b2 formulation obtained after performing the experiments described above; these reductions in VSV yield in IFN\u03b2-treated cells were measured relative to the VSV yields in control A549 cells that were not treated with IFN\u03b2.",

The antiviral and biologic activities of these formulations were compared by measuring: (1) the reduction of CPE by IFN\u03b2 on A549 human lung carcinoma cells following infection with VSV and (2) the levels of IFN\u03b2induced MxA, ADAR1, and ISG56 mRNAs, which encode antiviral proteins and are commonly assayed in cell cultures exposed to Type I IFN as an in vitro measure of IFN biologic activity. [30] [31] [32] [33] When equivalent unit amounts of the formulations were compared, IFN\u03b2-1a sc, IFN\u03b2-1a sc NF, and IFN\u03b2-1b sc demonstrated similar levels of antiviral activity in terms of IC 50 . However, when the formulations were compared on a weight basis (ng/mL), significantly more IFN\u03b2-1b sc was required to equal the antiviral activity of either When the formulations were compared on a weight basis, at 0.5 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, IFN\u03b2-1a sc and IFN\u03b2-1a sc NF induced significantly higher mRNA levels of (B) MxA, (D) ADAR1, and (F) ISG56 compared with IFN\u03b2-1b sc. * P < 0.05 for both comparisons using Student's t-test. \u2020 Calculated according to the specific activities of IFN\u03b2-1b sc (32 MIU/mg) and IFN\u03b2-1a sc (270 MIU/mg).

Similarly, when concentrations corresponding to 10 times the IC 50 of each IFN\u03b2 formulation were compared on a weight basis, a smaller reduction in VSV yield was observed with IFN\u03b2-1b sc than with either IFN\u03b2-1a sc formulation. However, when concentrations corresponding to 100 times the IC 50 of each IFN\u03b2 formulation were compared on a weight basis, VSV yield reductions were similar with each of the three IFN\u03b2 formulations, probably because at this concentration the plateau phase of the dose-response curve has been reached, and so differences in antiviral activity between IFN\u03b2 formulations are no longer observed. Importantly, differences in the IFN\u03b2-1a sc and IFN\u03b2-1b sc formulations on a weight basis were demonstrated by measuring the expression of wellestablished ISGs. In particular, IFN\u03b2-1a sc and IFN\u03b2-1a sc NF induced similar levels of ISG expression, and both induced significantly higher mRNA levels of ISGs compared with IFN\u03b2-1b sc. These findings suggest that, on a weight basis, biologic activity is equivalent for both formulations of IFN\u03b2-1a sc and greater than that of IFN\u03b2-1b sc. Thus, a greater weight of IFN\u03b2-1b sc may be needed to achieve the same biologic response as IFN\u03b2-1a sc, despite the fact that IFN\u03b2-1b sc has a molecular weight (approximately 18,500 daltons [34] ) that is approximately 82% of that of IFN\u03b2-1a sc (approximately 22,500 daltons [35] ). Antonetti and colleagues examined the antiviral activity of IFN\u03b2-1a for sc use and IFN\u03b2-1b for sc use using the same CPE assay system [1] and showed that IFN\u03b2-1a has an antiviral activity approximately 14 times greater than that of IFN\u03b2-1b (0.236 ng/mL versus 3.333 ng/mL, respectively). [1] Similar differences in biologic activity between IFN\u03b2-1a and IFN\u03b2-1b formulations have been reported previously. [9, 10] The findings of this pilot study emphasize the potential importance of determining the relative biologic activity of different IFN\u03b2 formulations, and suggest the amount of protein required to achieve a biologic response might be higher for IFN\u03b2-1b than IFN\u03b2-1a formulations. A notable limitation of this study was that IFN\u03b2-1a im (Avonex) was not included for comparison with the other available IFN\u03b2 formulations. To date, there are no published studies that have compared within the same assay system the biologic activity of all three IFN\u03b2 formulations currently approved for treatment of relapsing MS. A second potential limitation of the present study is that only a single virus and cell model system (VSV/A549) was used to study the biologic activity of the IFN\u03b2 formulations. Therefore, additional studies are required that compare the biologic activity of all approved IFN\u03b2 formulations; such studies should employ not only the VSV/A549 model system, but also other assay systems with different IFN-sensitive viruses, as well as types of IFN-sensitive cells.",
