Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, atypical pneumonia, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma. DNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. The identification of Mycoplasma faucium, Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma orale was performed by nested PCR with primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene corresponding to mycoplasma. M.faucium and M.salivarius was found in saliva at about 100%, and M.orale at a frequency of about 50%. Only M.faucium was found with the frequency of about 60% in the tissue of the patients.",

Mycoplasmas have a very small genome and, therefore, their survival depends on the host. Mycoplasmas have to use proteins, nucleic acids, cholesterol, fatty acids, etc., received from the host cells, to survive. At the same time, a disproportionately large number of mycoplasma genes are involved in cell adhesion problem and genes that contribute to the maintenance and care of parasitism surveillance by the immune system (for example, genes responsible for the synthesis of membrane antigens). Apparently, one of the main directions of mycoplasma's evolution in resolving the problem of survival is to become invisible to the immune system of the host organism. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, psoriasis, scleroderma, atypical pneumonia, cystitis, and Alzheimer's disease, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma [3] .",

However, most of these cytokines are growth factors. This means that when they interact with appropriate receptors, D cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (cdk 4/6) appear in the cell, which in turn initiate cell division. If the growth factor receptors located on the cell membrane, which are present in breast tissue, it may mean that such cytokines may promote cell division in a mammary gland. At the same time, cell division which is not controlled by the organism is one of the main (if not the main) symptom of cancer. Thereby mycoplasmas theoretically are able to participate in the development of cancer by activating cell division. Data presented in the Table 3 show that some cytokines can participate in the development of cancer. * IL-1\u03b2 -activates T cells. IL-2 -T-cell growth factor, stimulates IL-1 synthesis, activates B-cells and NK cells. IL-4growth factor for activated B cells, resting T cells, and mast cells. IL-6 -stimulates Ig synthesis, growth factor for plasma cells. TNF-a -a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, TGF-\u03b1 is a mitogenic polypeptide.

(B, C, D) -the detection of M. faucium, M. salivarius and M.orale in saliva using primers from RNA polymerase gene. The length of the synthesized DNA fragments using the 16S-23S primers varied in the course of saliva samples analysis and was constant in the tumor tissues analysis. This can be explained by the fact that the saliva samples usually contain several types of mycoplasma. In this case electrophoregram pattern depends not only on the types of mycoplasma but also on the ratio of their concentrations. Constant fragment size during tumor tissues analysis may indicate that only one type of mycoplasma was present. The specificity was experimentally confirmed by PCR analysis M.faucium in the presence or absence M.salivarium, most similar to M.faucium mycoplasma according to nucleotide sequence analysis. In addition, alignment of RNA polymerase beta subunit genes of the nine listed above mycoplasmas also points to the specificity of each pair of primers used in this work (results are not shown).",

Low frequency detection of mycoplasma in blood, together with the high frequency of detection of mycoplasma in tissue and saliva indicates the absence of false positive diagnosis of M.faucium.Earlier[4], in breast cancer patients M.hyorhinis has been detected. Nevertheless, we failed to confirm this conclusion, using the primers of the p29 gene, specific for M.hyorhinis, (for 10 patients, data not shown). This may be due to the different localization of the Chinese and Moldavian groups of patients.The results of these studies argue high frequency of M.faucium detection in tumor tissue of breast cancer patients.
