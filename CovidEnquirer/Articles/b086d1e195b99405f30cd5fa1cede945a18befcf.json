Microbiol., Two direct blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies to Breda virus in sera of cattle were compared. An ELISA with consecutive addition of antigen and test serum to an antibody-coated plate gave higher positive: negative absorbence ratios than an ELISA in which antigen and test serum were added simultaneously.",

            "text": "During an outbreak in 1979 of neonatal calf diarrhea in a beef herd in Breda, IA, U.S.A., a new virus was detected. This \"Breda virus\" (BRV) is morphologically and antigenically different from known bovine viruses and causes diarrhea in gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves (Woode et al., 1982) . An antigenic relationship of BRV with Berne virus (BEV) was discovered (Weiss et al., 1983 ) ; BEV has been extensively characterized (Weiss and Horzinek, 1987; Horzinek et al., 1987a,b) and proposed as prototype of the new family Toroviridae Horzinek et al., 1987a,b) . Other Breda viruses were found in the feces from a colostrum-deprived calf in Ames, IA (Woode et al., 1983) and in 5-6-month-old diarrheic calves in Ohio (Saif et al., 1981) . All viruses shared antigens as determined by enzyme-linked im-munosorbent assay (ELISA), with 6-10-fold differences between the homologous and heterologous reactions. For this reason and on the basis of hemagglutination inhibition tests and immune electron microscopy the three isolates were assigned to two serotypes: Breda virus Serotype I (BRV1) is represented by the original Breda, IA isolate, and Serotype 2 (BRV2) comprises the Ohio isolate and the second Iowa isolate (Woode et al., 1985) .",

In neonatal calves, BRV infections spread rapidly with diarrhea commencing as early as 1-3 days after birth (Woode, 1987) . Large amounts of virus (107 viral hemagglutinating units ml-1 ) were detectable in feces 3-4 days after infection. In experimentally infected calves incubation periods ranged from 20 to 172 h (Woode et al., 1982) . The role of older cattle and of other animal species in BRV epidemiology is not known.",

To remove excess immunoglobulin, the plates were washed with a solution of 0.15 M NaC1 containing 0.5% Tween 80. From this point onward, two different techniques were followed. In the first approach (consecutive method) a 1:400 dilution of the BRV2 antigen preparation, purified from calf feces was added to the coated wells in ELISA buffer 1 (PBS supplemented with 0.35 M NaC1, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 and 0.05% Tween 80 ). The plates were washed and the field serum to be tested was added at a 1:40 dilution in ELISA buffer 2 (PBS supplemented with 0.65 M NaC1, I mM EDTA pH 7.0 and 0.05% Tween 80). After another rinse, purified bovine anti-BRV2 immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (BaBRV2Ig-PO) diluted 1:250 in buffer 2 was added, and bound conjugate was visualized after adding the substrate (0.05 M citric acid, pH 4, containing 0.008% H202 and 0.2 mM 2,2'-azinodi-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid). High absorbence is seen in the absence of anti-BRV antibodies whereas the reaction is blocked when the ~serum contains antibodies. Hyperimmune sera against BRV2 and cryptosporidia or rotavirus, prepared similarly to Ba-BRV2Ig, served as positive (100% blocking) and negative (0% blocking) reference preparations.

Partially antibody-covered BRV2 antigen (as should be found after preincubation in the simultaneous ELISA) will probably not bind as efficiently to the antibody-coated polystyrene plate as BRV2 alone does. During the subsequent washing cycles these complexes may be rinsed away and no binding sites for the conjugate will be left, resulting in a false-positive blocking reaction. In combination with the higher P/N ratios determined for the consecutive ELISA we decided to use this method in all further experiments. At this point all German sera had already been assayed in the simultaneous test.",

At higher antibody concentrations, however, the ELISA results will be the same, leading to an accumulation of animals in the 90-100% blocking group. This is likely to occur when tests are performed at a constant serum dilution (1:40 in our case ). When disregarding these groups in the frequency distribution of blocking percentages, a normal distribution can be recognized. The graph for the sera from Germany has a maximum at lower values as compared with the graph from The Netherlands. The different test system used for the German sera does not explain this lower median value: a higher percentage of seropositive animals should be expected, as discussed above, leading to a right shift of the distribution of blocking percentages. A similar difference was observed within the Dutch sera between the Provinces Gelderland and Overijssel. One reason for this finding may be a lower incidence of BRV infections in farms in Overijssel and Germany, resulting in less frequent booster infections. A second possibility is that different sampling strategies between the Animal Health Services would give similar results: if a relatively high percentage of animals between 3 and 6 months of age is tested, when most calves are seronegative, lower overall values may be calculated; the age was unknown for many animals. Third, a torovirus serotype, different from that in our test, may exist in cattle in Europe. When studying our ELISA results per animal, lower average blocking percentages are found in the Overijssel area; therefore, the presence of a different serotype in this province is a possibility.",

Antibodies were absent in specified pathogen-free calves from the Central Veterinary Institute, Lelystad, and in 1-day-old diarrheic calves from the Department of Large Animal Medicine with low blood protein levels as a result of insufficient colostrum intake. This indicates that the BRV antibodies in young calves are maternally derived as has been found for antibodies to other pathogens (Snodgrass and Wells, 1978) ; indeed all colostrum samples tested had high levels of antibodies to BRV. The rise in percentage of seropositive animals at 2 months of age indicates an infection in the 1-month age group. For rotaviruses, enteric infection in the presence of circulating antibodies has been proven (Moerman et al., 1982; Snodgrass and Wells, 1978) . We have preliminary data indicating that a similar situation exists for BRV. The sudden seroconversion of most calves at the age of 6-7 months coincides with the time they are stabled after the grazing period; this leads to closer contact with older cattle and exposure to infection. Crouch and Acres (1984) have shown that up to 44% of adult cows excrete rotavirus and 77% coronavirus with their feces. The role of fecal spread from seropositive cows in BRV epidemiology remains to be studied.",
