A decentralization of manufacturing industries from urban centres was accompanied by the rise of service and creative industry districts on previous industrial sites. This article explores the interconnections of global forces, stateemarket relationships, land use policies, art markets, the Chinese system of governance, and other trans-local factors in transforming Beijing from an industrial city to a service and creative industries-oriented global metropolis, by examining the rise and transformation of Beijing 798 Art District. The case study finds that decommissioned industrial sites had characteristics that made them attractive when central and local governments started to promote creative industries, but, with development of urban art districts, the impact of avant-garde artists on the direction of development was reduced, and developers, high profile galleries and multinational corporations had an increasing influence. The results of our study indicate that the literature on intra-metropolitan location and change, and the evolution of industrial districts should pay more attention to the reuse of the decommissioned industrial land and sites for industrial restructuring, and particularly to the role of multi-scalar factors in reshaping the geography of cities.",

Questionable observation of these trends has even led to the idea that services can provide an alternative basis for economic growth to manufacturing (Gershuny, 1977) . The service sector includes dynamic and non-dynamic sectors and tax and market-financed services. These activities include the cultural industries (originally identified by Frankfurt School theoreticians Adorno and Horkheimer to denote the mass production of standardized cultural goods). The cultural industries are frequently construed as creative industries in which human creativity is harnessed to promote innovation (Caves, 2004; Landry, 2000) . These industries are concentrated in large cities where major cultural industry players are located and where government-funded galleries, museums, libraries and universities are strongly represented and talented people are attracted.",

In 1982, Beijing was redefined as a national political and cultural centre, and in the 1992 Master Plan as a 'modern international city'. Its position as a national economic centre was played down, and light industries and polluting enterprises were required to leave in order to provide space for high-end services and high technology industries. Consequent industrial decentralization released a great quantity of vacated industrial land: approximately 60 ha of industrial land were vacated from 1985 to 1997 owing to industrial relocation, of which more than 70% was located within the urban core (Feng, Zhou, & Wu, 2008) . Industrial relocation accelerated later, in order to meet the requirements of the 'Green Beijing Olympic Games'. From 1999 to 2005, over 150 industrial enterprises were moved out, and the proportion of industrial land in the built-up area within the fourth ring road decreased from 8.74% to 6.6%, vacating 900 ha of industrial land (Feng et al., 2008) . This decommissioned industrial land was an important asset when it came to promoting creative industries: good transport access, cheap rents, a peaceful environment, and attractive historical buildings, with high ceilings, large windows, open space and unique styles of architecture met the requirements of creative artists enabling some old industrial sites to capitalize on these assets. The Factory 798 Art District is a case in point: indeed as the largest Chinese contemporary art community developed on the site of a previous military industrial complex, it acted as a role model in the transformation of the Beijing Municipality from a national industrial city to an emerging global creative city.",

However, the SevenStar Group strongly argued that the artists had no right to redevelop the industrial area, as they were merely 'temporary' tenants according to China's urban land regulation. Hence, in 2004, the SevenStar Group announced that artists could no longer rent new places in the industrial area.

I know the rent of some places is now 8 Yuan/m 2 /day. It is too expensive for us. If I did not rent this workshop as early as 2004, and if my rent contact was not as long as ten years, it would also difficult for me Some artists moved studios out as the area was changed by the arrival of new operators and the noise caused by increasing numbers of visitors. As they did, high profile foreign galleries entered. Before 2005, there were approximately 20 galleries (Table 3) , largely from Asian countries, especially Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. These foreign-owned galleries often occupied less than 800 m 2 . The largest one (Art Seasons Gallery from Singapore) occupied 764 m 2 . Two years later, the situation had changed. In 2008 the number of galleries reached 153, while the studios stood at 43 (Table 3 ). In contrast to early galleries, some of the new ones rented large amounts of floor space. The Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA), which is self-proclaimed not-for-profit art institution founded by the Belgian collectors, Guy and Myriam Ullens, was opened in 2007, and rented 5000 m 2 of floor space. UCCA gained considerable global repute since hundreds of art museum curators, collectors, and artists from around the world were invited to attend its opening ceremony. After the arrival of UCCA, other high profile galleries moved in, including, for example, in 2007 Gallery Artside (Korean), and in 2008 Pace Gallery (American), White Space Beijing (Italy), and Artlinkart (Spain). Artlinkart occupied 4000 m 2 and Pace Gallery 3000 m 2 . Moreover, the large galleries became mixed businesses. For example, UCCA includes exhibition space, a cinema, video archives, multimedia reading rooms, workshops, an image books room, an academic lecture hall, a museum, a cafe and an art shop.",

More galleries followed. However, increasing visitor numbers and the popularity of the district made it attractive to multinational companies, including three German luxury carmakers (Mercedes-Benz, Audi AG and Bavarian Motor Works), who used empty adjacent space (751 D-Park) for sales promotions ( Fig. 6 ; Zielke & Waibel, 2014) . Audi AG established an Asian research and development (R&D) centre to target Asian and in particular Chinese consumers. It occupies more than 8000 m 2 , and employs approximately 600 people. At approximately the same time, Qihoo 360 Technology, a leading anti-virus and Internet security company in China, took over two whole buildings.",

Microscopic cases can be used to understand the complexity of this process. The transformation of Factory 798 from an industrial site to a creative park was to a large extent driven by wider forces operating at multiple scales, including global forces, stateemarket relationships, land use policies, the operation of art markets and the Chinese system of governance.",

The speed of state-led urban industrial decentralization (Gao et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014) , and the specific system of land ownership help explain these characteristics. After their withdrawal SOEs still had use rights, and had an interest in maximizing rents and land values, but the Chinese government wanted and was able to encourage creative industries due to their perceived impact on city competitiveness. The subsequent evolution of the zone in the direction of gentrification and luxury consumption is, however, similar to that in western countries. In the Beijing case, overseas actors played significant roles in nearly all phases of land use change (including two first phase art enterprises, large foreign galleries, and foreign carmakers).",
