            "text": "Tuna pyloric caeca aminopeptidase (tAP) is a glycosylated zinc-metalloenzyme containing apparently two identical subunits. The enzyme is reversibly inhibited in a time-dependent manner by amastatin. Slow development of tAP inhibition by this inhibitor could be demonstrated. Dissociation of the complex of tAP with amastatin is also slow. Two molar equivalents of the inhibitor are bound by the enzyme suggesting the presence of one catalytic site in each subunit, Chemical modification of tAP with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbonyl-metho-p-toluene sulfonate and N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-l,2-dihydroquinone revealed the presence of essential acidic amino acid residues probably located at the active site. Compatible with the presence of arginine and tyrosine residues at the catalytic site of most metalloproteinases, tAP is reversibly inhibited by phenylglyoxai and inactivated by tetranitromethane in a time-dependent fashion. The rate of inhibition by these modifiers could be significantly decreased if the enzyme was previously treated with amastatin suggesting that the modified amino acid residues are located at the catalytic site. Diethylpyrocarbonate did not affect the activity of both native and zinc-depleted tAP suggesting that histidine is not involved in the zinc-ligand formation.",

The slow formation of tAPamastatin complexes can be demonstrated and dissociation of these complexes was also shown to be slow suggesting a tight binding behaviour. This property allows amastatin to be used as a catalytic site titrant; tAP binds two molar equivalents of the inhibitor. Because amastatin has been assumed to be a transition-state analogue, only catalytically active enzyme is expected to bind the inhibitor with high affinity. The result obtained in this study suggests the presence of one catalytic site per tAP subunit. This is consistent with the presence of one zinc-atom per tAP subunit [13] . However, the possibility that species other than catalytically active tAP might bind the inhibitor cannot be ruled out. Bestatin, another transition-state analogue, was used for titration of catalytic site of blLAP [23] . The enzyme binds six equivalents of the inhibitor per hexamer. This result is in agreement with X-ray crystallographic studies [24, 25] . As for AP-A tAP is not inhibited by bestatin. This characteristic distinguishes markedly tAP from LAP.",
