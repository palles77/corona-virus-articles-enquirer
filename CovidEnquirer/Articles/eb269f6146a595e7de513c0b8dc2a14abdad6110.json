[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] After PCV introduction in national immunisation programmes, reductions in the incidence and severity of childhood pneumonia have been reported in highincome countries 4, 6 and in Latin America. 5 However, the eff ect of these programmes on childhood pneumonia and child health in Africa, where a large burden of pneumonia exists, is not well studied outside of vaccine trials. Identifi cation of pneumonia causes in the context of robust immunisation programmes is an ongoing priority for child health. Case-control studies undertaken in high-income countries have reported viral pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to be a major cause of pneumonia in children vaccinated with 13-valent PCV (PCV13), 7, 8 but data are few from low-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore most causal data comes from crosssectional samples of pneumonia cases admitted to hospital, but cause might vary with patient age or severity of disease.",

We based co-organism analysis on matched casecontrol pairs, investigating the presence or absence of two organisms at a time.

            "text": "Several potential pathogens were identifi ed in children with pneumonia, adding to evidence that childhood pneumonia and severe disease might often not be due to a single organism. 7, 8 RSV, the most identifi ed organism, was associated with severe disease but not with high mortality, which is consistent with global and African data preceding use of PCV that reported RSV to be the most common pathogen in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). [17] [18] [19] These results are similar to those from a 2015 meta-analysis 20 of case-control studies in childhood in which RSV was most strongly associated with LRTI, with infl uenza, parainfl uenza, and human metapneumovirus also important causative organisms. 20 With increasing uptake of PCV in lowincome and middle-income countries, the proportion of LRTI due to viruses-particularly RSV-could be expected to increase. 21 In South Africa, in view of these incidence rates, about 324 000 pneumonia cases might be expected in infants annually, with almost 71 300 cases due to RSV. In our study, many children had wheezing associated with RSV, raising the question of whether these were cases of pneumonia or of bronchiolitis. In our study we applied WHO pneumonia defi nitions because they are widely used for their high sensitivity. Furthermore, pneumonia and bronchiolitis are a spectrum of LRTI, representing diff erent manifestations of infection or host response. Of note, RSV occurred in young infants with the peak incidence in those younger 6 months, as has been previously reported. 17 Maternal immunisation against RSV during late pregnancy might therefore be an attractive novel strategy to prevent disease in young infants. 22 Bacterial-viral co-infections have been reported to be important, especially in severe pneumonia. 23 In an African PCV9 trial, 24 immunisation reduced hospital admissions for viral LRTI by a third, suggesting that pneumococcal-viral co-infection leads to severe pneumonia. Another study 23 reported that an increasing number of co-infections was associated with more severe disease and higher mortality in children admitted to hospital with LRTI. However in our study, the only bacteria associated with pneumonia were B pertussis and H infl uenzae. B pertussis occurred in young infants and mostly before completion of the three immunisations; immunisation of pregnant women with B pertussis might be eff ective to prevent this burden. 25 The observed association between H infl uenzae and pneumonia supports recent evidence suggesting that non-typeable H infl uenzae might be an important pathogen in pneumonia. 26 Although the strength of the association was relatively weak, since H infl uenzae was identifi ed in more than half of cases the contribution of this organism to pneumonia might be substantial. The absence of an association of other bacteria with pneumonia could refl ect several possibilities. High PCV13 coverage reduces pneumonia incidence, as described in other settings. 4,6,27 In a USA case-control study 7 of children admitted to hospital for pneumonia who had received PCV, more than two-thirds were reported to be due to viral causes (with RSV predominating) whereas only 7% of children had bacterial-viral co-infection. Additionally, bacterial-viral co-infection has been predominantly associated with severe or very severe pneumonia, 23,24 but in our study most cases were non-severe pneumonia. Finally, bacterial causes might be especially diffi cult to ascribe because of high rates of colonisation. Specimens from the upper respiratory tract might be of little use to establish bacterial causes. Research is needed to understand interactions between organisms and the role of several potential pathogens.",

To obtain a representative sample from the lower respiratory tract might be diffi cult in young children and contamination with colonising organisms, such as S pneumoniae, could occur. 11 This contamination might lead to an underestimation of the contribution of bacteria causing pneumonia. Similarly, although new molecular diagnostics enable detection of many respiratory viruses and less easily culturable bacteria, distinguishing live pathogenic organisms from those colonising or infecting the upper respiratory tract or residual nucleic acid from previous infections is diffi cult. 9 Taking samples from the upper respiratory tract, therefore, restricts inferences of causality regarding lung disease. Furthermore, multiplex PCR identifi es a broad range of potential pathogens, but the sensitivity for individual pathogens might be lower than a singleplex PCR. Sample quality is another key determinant of the accuracy of a diagnostic test, but we could not verify the quality of samples, or normalise quantitative results to a host target. A strength of this study is the use of diff erent or several specimens, which increases detection of organisms. In a pre-PCV Kenyan study 18 of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia, culture or PCR of blood, induced sputum, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal specimens led to incremental detection of organisms. However, with a case-control analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs, RSV was the only signifi cantly associated pathogen. 18 Similarly, although our study was able to detect several potential pathogens through intensive specimen collection and use of sensitive assays, the case-control analysis showed signifi cant associations with pneumonia for only B pertussis, H infl uenzae, RSV, infl uenza virus, parainfl uenza, adenovirus, bocavirus, and cytomegalovirus.",

Of note, induced sputum was obtainable in young infants and in those with severe pneumonia. Although the value of induced sputum for microbiological confi rmation of tuberculosis in children has been shown in large studies, 10 in our study its use showed a substantial incremental yield for B pertussis and for some viruses associated with pneumonia. A Kenyan study 18 found induced sputum increased the yield of potential bacterial pathogens compared with blood culture, and detected a virus in more than half of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia. However, there was discordance between results from induced sputum and blood culture samples. 18 A Finnish study 28 reported that a potential bacterial or viral pathogen was detected by PCR in 97% of children admitted to hospital with pneumonia with an adequate induced sputum sample. Accurate detection of a pathogen-eg, B pertussis-enables timely appropriate treatment, infection control, and could help to reduce morbidity. Use of induced sputum samples should be further investigated for causal diagnosis of childhood pneumonia.",

            "text": "We found quantitative analysis of organism load unhelpful for distinguishing colonising from pathogenic organisms, except for RSV. However, since RSV was strongly associated with pneumonia its quantifi cation did not provide additional information. Our study highlights the need for better diagnostics in childhood pneumonia to distinguish colonisation from pathogenic organisms, particularly for potential bacterial pathogens. Until more specifi c tests for bacterial causes are available, no changes can be made to WHO's recommended empirical therapy with antibiotics. 14 Several features of our study strengthen our results. First, selection of cases and controls from a large prospective cohort allows inferences that extend beyond those aff orded by case-only designs, while minimising for selection biases in previous studies of pneumonia causes. Second, investigation of causes by pneumonia severity (including ambulatory cases and cases admitted to hospital) and control symptomatology allows more defi nitive examination of pathogen associations. However, our study is still limited by absence of data for longitudinal nasopharyngeal colonisation to attribute causes at the time of pneumonia onset. Longitudinal analyses are underway to address this issue and to further study co-pathogens. Although we might have missed some cases of pneumonia, the pneumonia surveillance systems, longitudinal review of patient records, and excellent cohort retention ensured that this was extremely rare. These results might not be generalisable to low-income and middle-income countries with lower levels of immunisation coverage or in countries where H infl uenzae type b or PCV are not included in immunisation programmes. However, the uptake of H infl uenzae type b and PCV globally including in Africa has increased, 29 so these results are likely to be widely applicable in low-income and middle-income countries. Our study provides important new information on the association between specifi c organisms and pneumonia after children have received PCV in a middleincome country, but also highlights the complexities in ascribing causality and in defi ning the role of several organisms in childhood pneumonia.",
