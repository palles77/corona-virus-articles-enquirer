The clinical use of antiviral agents for respiratory illness has been hampered by the fact that there are multiple causes, including over 200 serologically distinct viruses representing 6 major virus families [lJ. So far, virus-specific antiviral agents have been developed only for influenza A viruses (amantadine, rimantadine), and future advances in the field will depend in part on identifying other potent, selective agents. In addition, this large group of viruses cause a relatively small number of overlapping clinical syndromes. Particular syndromes can be caused by a number of different viruses, and conversely, a particular virus can cause a number of different clinical syndromes. The viruses also have different epidemiologic patterns. Together these observations mean that effective prophylaxis against all respiratory viral illnesses would require a broad spectrum agent that could be continuously administered, a possibility which appears remote at the present time. Alternatively, effective intervention depends on the use of narrow spectrum agents in conjunction with rapid, specific viral diagnosis.",

For the use of antivirals, this means that effective drug concentrations must be achieved at the site of infection, within cells of the respiratory epithelium, and raises the practical problem of gaining adequate delivery of orally or parenterally administered antivirals to the respiratory mucosa. On the other hand, the topical use of antivirals affords the potential of achieving high regional antiviral concentrations while reducing the risks of systemic toxicity or avoiding unfavorable pharmacology associated with systemic use. This approach has been used sucessfully with aerosolized ribavirin [2-6J and with intranasal interferon [7-17J, but the nature of the delivery system is a critical variable.",

Seasonal prophylaxis can be most effectively used against viral infections that occur in epidemics of short duration. This pattern is classically shown by the influenza viruses which cause annual outbreaks, lasting 6-8 weeks in a particular region. While many other viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus types 1 and 2, rhinovirus, and coronavirus have distinctly seasonal patterns, the duration of their periods of activity, the associated attack rates, and the occurrence of overlapping periods of activity are important variables in considering seasonal prophylaxis.",

Table I shows the results of representative placebo-controlled studies of the prophylaxis of influenza A virus infections and illustrates how an antiviral agent can be used effectively in an epidemic disease such as influenza. In seasonal prophylaxis in open populations of students, oral amantadine and rimantadine have been associated with protective efficacy ranging up to 90% against illness due to laboratory-confirmed influenza A virus infection [19,20J .

Galbraith et al found complete protection against influenzal illness in household contacts of index cases with proven influenza A infection [21J, but a follow-up study found little evidence of protection in contacts who were seronegative [26J. Studies of this approach using rimantadine are currently in progress. Several different studies have established the efficacy of institution-based prophylaxis. One trial conducted at the University of Washington found that amantadine was highly effective in preventing illness or infection due to influenza in patients hospitalized on acute medical wards [22J. A recent study found that a lower amantadine dose was highly protective in a large group of teenaged boys housed in an English public boarding school [23J. A study at the University of Rochester found that rimantadine was prophylactically effective in elderly nursing home residents [24,25J. For those who were immunized, a 75% reduction in clinical influenza was found in the rimantadine group compared to placebo. This and other studies have found that an additive effect appears to exist between protection from amantadine or rimantadine and from inactivated influenza vaccine. One of the impediments to wider use of amantadine in the United States has been a concern regarding drug side effects. As initially pointed out by Russian investigators [32J, rimantadine has significantly lower potential for causing side effects when administered at the same dosage as amantadine. In a study conducted at the University of Vermont, students were given amantadine or rimantadine prophylaxis at a dose of 200 mg per day for a period of 6 weeks [20J. The percent of subjects who developed central nervous system toxicity was significantly higher in the amantadine group (13%) than in either the rimantadine (6%) or placebo (4%) groups. This toxicity was primarily manifested as insomnia, jitteriness, or difficulty concentrating. At the University of Virginia, a short-term study compared the tolerance of these drugs in healthy adults at a dose of 300 mg per day for 5 days [33J. The fraction of amantadine recipients who developed central nervous system toxicity increased to 39%, whereas the rimantadine group (13%) did not differ Significantly from placebo (9%). Both drugs were associated with significantly higher rates of GI side effects (amantadine, 20%; rimantadine, 16%), primarily nausea and upset stomach, than placebo (3%). Pharmacokinetics",

Amantadine was readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly achieved high plasma concentrations, whereas rimantadine had slower oral absorption and achieved significantly lower plasma concentrations. The plasma elimination half-life of rimantadine was approximately twice that of amantadine, and urinary excretion of rimantadine was much less than that of amantadine, which is excreted unchanged in the urine.

Part of the answer may lie in the ~ vitro and animal model observations that rimantadine has somewhat greater intrinsic antiviral activity than amantadine. Importantly, the drugs appear to differ in volume of distribution and penetration into respiratory secretions. In the study described above, the maximum measured nasal mucus concentrations during an 8-hour period were similar for amantadine and rimantadine, and the ratio of peak nasal mucus to plasma concentrations was over 2-fold higher for rimantadine (0.7129.62 vs 1.73~1.04, p<0.02), which suggests that rimantadine may be concentrated in respiratory secretions. Since mucus concentrations may more accurately reflect intracellular concentrations in the respiratory mucosa than plasma concentrations, these pharmacokinetic observations may provide part of the explanation for the clinical efficacy of rimantadine at doses which are associated significantly lower plasma concentrations. In summary, the pharmacologic differences between these drugs confirm a clinical advantage for rimantadine with respect to comparable efficacy at doses that have significantly lower potential for side effects.

            "text": "Because of their broad spectrum ~ vitro antiviral activity and apparent role in the resolution of viral infections, interferons have long been considered important candidates for the prophylaxis of respiratory virus infections. Work in this area received a tremendous boost when recombinant DNA techniques were successfully applied to the production of interferon, and a wide range of volunteer experiments have been conducted in the past 4 years [7-11J. Volunteer studies These studies have generally used similar designs in which volunteers were given intranasal interferon in spray or drop form before and for several days after being exposed to a rhinovirus by nasal challenge. Studies conducted at several centers have conclusively shown that (1) recombinant alpha2 interferons, specifically leukocyte A interferon (rIFN-A) and interferon-alpha2 (rIFN-~2), provide protection against experimental rhinovirus colds involving a range of rhinovirus serotypes [8,9,12J. (2) In studies at the Common Cold Unit, protection has also been observed with human leukocyte-derived interferon, lymphoblastoid interferon, and recently with recombinant IFN-~ [7,11J. (3) Field studies The encouraging results observed in volunteer studies led to field trials designed to determine whether intranasal interferon could protect against natural respiratory virus infections. The first of these double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was conducted in Charlottesville in September 1982 and was timed to coincide with the annual fall peak in rhinovirus activity [14J. Recombinant IFN-~2 was administered by intranasal spray at a dose of 10x10 6 IU once daily. During the 3-week spray period, 13 rhinoviruses and 1 enterovirus were recovered from placebo subjects with upper respiratory illness, an attack rate of about 9%, whereas none of the interferon group had documented rhinovirus colds. Importantly, no rebound in rhinovirus infection was observed during the 4 weeks after stopping spray use. However, the number of respiratory illnesses (defined as the occurrence of 2 respiratory symptoms on 1 day or, alternatively, the occurrence of ~1 symptoms on ~2 consecutive days) was significantly higher in the interferon (94 illnesses) than placebo group (64 illnesses). Further analysiS showed that these illnesses occurred principally during the second and third weeks of interferon administration and were largely due to complaints of nasal obstruction, which is now recognized to be a manifestation of the local side effects of interferon.",

However, these studies have not found protection against coronavirus, influenza A, or parainfluenza virus infections. More importantly, the field studies using long-term administration have not been able to clearly show a beneficial effect in regard to prevention of respiratory symptoms. This is due in part to the observation that up to one-half of interferon-exposed adults will develop nasal side effects after several weeks of exposure [16, 17J. Toxicity The most commonly encountered complaints are nasal stuffiness, blood-tinged nasal mucus, and nasal dryness. The occurrence of these complaints is related to both the dose and duration of exposure [9,14-17J. On examination, symptomatic individuals have had signs of mucosal friability, including punctate bleeding sites and, less often, ulcerations.

Fifty-eight percent of interferon recipients but none of those in the placebo group had a moderate or severe degree of subepithelial inflammatory cell infiltration, which consisted primarily of lymphocytes. When affected interferon recipients were rebiopsied 8 weeks after completing exposure, the biopies had returned to normal, indicating that the histopathologic changes were reversible [39J.

            "text": "The occurrence of local intolerance during long-term or seasonal prophylaxis has led to the exploration of alternative strategies for using intranasal interferon. One alternative is treatment of an established infection, and several studies have been conducted in experimentally induced rhinovirus infection to assess therapeutic activity. In one trial at the University of Virginia, rIFN-i2 was given by nasal drops at a dose of 9x10 6 IU 3 times per day for 5 days beginning 28 hours after infection [41J. The proportion of virus positive days was reduced by over 50% in the interferon group compared to placebo, and the median duration of virus shedding was reduced nearly 3.5 days in the interferon group. Studies of quantitative virus shedding found that interferon markedly reduced virus titers in nasal secretions by the third day of administration compared to placebo. Nasal symptom scores peaked on the second and third days after infection in the placebo group but were significantly lower in interferon recipients. There were also clear trends toward reduced quantities of nasal mucus production on these days. Overall, each of these measures of illness severity averaged about 50% lower in the interferon group compared to placebo. In summary, interferon administration during the late incubation period of rhinovirus infection significantly modified, but did not prevent rhinovirus colds. Further studies are needed to determine if interferon treatment will reduce symptoms, transmissibility of infection, or the risk of complications in natural colds. Postexposure prophylaxis Another logical strategy for preventing common colds is postexposure prophylaxis of family contacts. Investigators at several institutions have recently completed long-term double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to determine the usefulness of intranasal interferon in preventing illness in the household contacts of family members with respiratory illness [42, 43] . Whereas low doses of rIFN-aA (0.3 or 1.5 x 10 6 IU/day for 5 days) did not appear to prevent transmission of colds [43] , higher doses of rIFN-_2 (5 x 10 6 IU/day for 7 days) significantly reduced respiratory illness occurrence in family contacts [42] . Interferon was also well tolerated when used in this manner, and evidence of cumulative toxicity was not found. Table III summarizes clinical applications of antiviral agents in respiratory viral infections. For influenza A virus infections, both oral amantadine and rimantadine are effective when used for seasonal prophylaxis and for prophylaxis in institutional populations. Both of these drugs, as well as aerosolized ribavirin, have antiviral and therapeutic effects in uncomplicated influenza. It remains to be determined whether any of these modalities or possibly their combined use [44] will be useful in treating severe influenza in hospitalized patients or whether they can prevent the development of complications in high risk patients. Unfortunately, there is no parenteral formulation of amantadine or rimantadine for use in critically ill patients. Aerosolized ribavirin has also been shown to have modest therapeutic effects in influenza B virus infection. However, a major need exists for an antiviral which is active against influenza B virus and which can be used on an outpatient basis. Controlled clinical trials have shown that aerosolized ribavirin therapy improves arterial oxygenation and modifies the severity of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and pneumonia [3,5J. Its role in treating life-threatening disease or in modifying the long-term sequelae of RSV infections are unknown at the present time. Again, a specific antiviral agent is needed for outpatient use in preventing or treating RSV infections.",

Studies at the University of Rochester found that amantadine (100 or 200 mg/day for 5 days) was superior to aspirin in providing relief of symptoms [29J. A recent pediatric trial (mean age 4-6 years) from the University of Rochester found that oral rimantadine (3 mg/kg/day up to 150 mg/d for 5 days) was more effective than acetaminophen in relieving the symptoms of influenza A-H3N2 subtype virus infection, although a rebound in virus shedding was observed after stopping therapy [31J.
