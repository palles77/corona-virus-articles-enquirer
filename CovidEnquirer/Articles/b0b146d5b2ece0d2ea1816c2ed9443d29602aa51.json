Among its advantages are the low concentrations at which lntubltions are produced (0.01-1.0 #M), a minimum of troublesome side effects (e.g., little or no change of protein synthesis or ATP levels), and a reversible action [1] . The purpose of this review is to examine the mechanism of action and specificity of monensln in Na+/H \u00f7 exchange and to attempt to reconcile tlus to the large body of structural and biochemical Information on monensin toxicity derived from animal studies",

The potential use of tonophores as probes of biological function, or as potential therapeutic agents, was recognized very early [2] [3] [4] [5] , but major economic Importance was not forthcoming until the discovery of monensin in 1967 and the recognlnon of tts potential in the poultry mdustrTy as a coccxdtostat [6] Subsequently, ~t was discovered that tonophores also could improve feed converston in rumtnants such as cattle [7, 8] , thus adding further to their commercial value Of the more than 100 lonophores that have been reported [9] , three, monensln, lasalocld and sahnomysin, have widespread commercial use Of those licensed, monensin is probably used most widely.",

The emphasis on heart physiology stemmed from this organ's strong dependence on calcmm for proper functioning [20] . Indeed, subsequent studies of X-537A used as a feed additive for poultry and cattle has shown that the heart ~s a primary target for lonophore toxicity [21] . X-537A affects many other cellular functions such as release of b~olog~cally active agents and the induction of sperm acrosome reactions of several species [19, 22] .",

            "text": "Monensin is an open chain molecule that is capable of ton complexation through a cyclic form stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups Charge transfer bonding Wltinn the cavity formed is responsible for 1on binding (Fig 1) _ Because the affinity of monensln for Na + is 10-ttmes that for K+. tts nearest competitor in biological systems. Bergan and Bates [26] ) The aniomc form of the lonophore is stabilized by the polar environment characteristic to the surface of a membrane_ The ionophore is capable of ion pamng with a metal cation either at the terrmnal carboxyhc acid moiety or at other internal sites The binding of a cation Initiates the formation of a hpophahc, cyclic catlon-lonophore complex that can diffuse through the interior of the blmolecular membrane structure_ After traversing the membrane, the complex is again subjected to a polar environment where the electrostatic forces that had stablhzed the complex are no longer greater than the unfavorable Gibbs free energy change of cyclzzation The ionophore then releases its enclosed cation and reverts to the low energy acyclic conformation Monensin, like other carboxyhc lonophores, binds metal ions through liganding s~tes such that the ions become centrally oriented ( Fig. 1) and masked from the extraceUular environment [10, 12, 19] . The outer surface of the ionophore-lon complex is composed largely of nonpolar hydrocarbon, which imparts a high solubility to the complexes m nonpolar solvents [10, 12, 19] In biological systems, these complexes are freely soluble in the lipid components of membranes and, presumably, diffuse through the membranes from one aqueous membrane interface to the other [10, 25] . Once the ion traverses the membrane as a monensin-lon complex, the ion is released, and the monensin molecule picks up a proton to form an undissociated molecule which then retraverses the membrane to release the proton to the outside of the cell, vesicle, organelle, or other subcellular compartment [19] (Fig. 2) . Thus, the net effect for monensin is a trans-membrane exchange of monovalent ions for protons. The 1on transfer rates may be very high and can approach, or even exceed, normal enzyme diffusion rates [19] , although the actual rate may be markedly altered depending on factors such as the concentration of K \u00f7 m the external medium and the 227 type and concentration of permeant ion that accompariles the accumulated K + [27] . However, effects of lonophores on cation transport and their distribution among different membrane-bounded compartments within the cell, will vary depending upon the physical and chemical properties of the different membranes. Membrane fluidity, thickness, curvature, charge and orientation of polar head groups of phosphohpids, cholesterol content, and protein content, all influence solubihty, penetration, and expression of the lonophore [28] . Moreover, in asymmetric membranes (i.e., biological membranes), ionophores generally exhibit asymmetric transport properties [29] . For example, Kovac et al [28] showed that both vahnomycm and nigericin (an lonophore similar to monensin) crossed the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cereotslae at a rather low rate but then were preferentially located, and active as ~onophores, m the tuner mltochondrlal membrane. Thus, the physiological effects of monensln will depend on the membrane composition and functional characteristics of the different compartments involved.",

Cultured cells, cells of tissue shces or explants, and plant organs that have received a topical exposure to monensin sufficient to inhibit growth or some cellular processes, usually show deviations in Golgl apparatus structure and function. In contrast, ceils from animals poisoned by ingested monensin often exhibit gross mltochondrlal lesions without the corresponding Golgl apparatus modifications. The reasons for these fundamental differences in cellular responses to monensin provide one focus for the present review and illustrate the many complexities surrounding the use of monensln as a probe specific to a single metabolic process.",

For simplicity, the stack may be divided into umts (measured from cis to trans faces) each of which represents a known set of functions. Currently, there appear to be some 2-3 such units that make up each stack [128, 129] . In reahty, however, it seems more likely that these changes in function occur gradually across the stack of Clsternae rather than in discrete steps.",

            "text": "Several mechanisms for the movement of membrane and product through the Golgi apparatus have been postulated. For example, movement may occur by sequential maturation of Golgi apparatus elements (i.e., formation, maturation and loss of cxsternae) through the Golgl apparatus stack [127] . This would require the formation of new Clsternae on one face of a Golgl apparatus sack and commensurate loss of Clsternae from the opposite face of the stack The source of these new Clsternae is a special region of endoplasmic retlculum which gives rise to transition vesicles that move and condense on the forming (ClS) face of the stack where they fuse together to form the new osternae [137] [138] [139] Product movement may also occur by shuttle vesicles at the peripheries of the Clsternae that move proteins from one cisterna to the next [140] . However, both direct (i e., nonvesicular) movement of substances into Golgi apparatus cisternae and an endoplasmlc reticulum-mediated movement of product through the penpheral tubules of the Clsternae must also be considered as viable options for the delivery and transfer of substances in and out of the Golgl apparatus [141] . The post-Golgl apparatus structures appear to move membrane and product almost entirely via shuttle vesicles, many of which are coated [142] [143] [144] Monensin exerts its most profound effects on the trans cxsternae of the Golgi apparatus stacks in those regions of the apparatus primarily associated with the final stages of secretory vesicle maturation and in post-Golgl apparatus structures primarily associated with endocytosis and membrane/product sorting. Because of its relative specificity, biologists have used monensln extensively as an inhibitor of trans Golgl apparatus function.",

In mouse thymocytes, monensin leads to 23 (1 stimulated incorporation of labeled sialyl-, galactosyl-, and N-acetyl glycosaminyl residues [111] . This enhanced accumulation was not due to a &rect effect of monensin on glycosyltransferase activities but, rather, as a consequence of a greater entry and accumulation of labeled sugar nucleotides in the swollen Clsternae_ Galactosyl transferase itself was translocated through the Golga apparatus at a slower rate with monensin_ However, the sialylatlon of the O-11nked ohgosaccharides of the enzyme was unaffected by monensln treatment [59] Effects of monensin on glycosyltransferases also may be indirect. Monensin has been reported to decrease galactosyltransferase activity m Golgl apparatus of rat embryo fibroblasts [79] although it had no effect on this activity in baby hamster kidney cells [146] Monensln is an especially useful inhibitor, since it blocks lntracellular transport of protein at the level of the Golgl apparatus without directly affecting protein synthesis [35, 52] The effect of monensin is considered to be on transport rather than on processing per se [121, 147] One argument is that oligosaccharide processing of those glycoprotelns that reach the appropriate site occurs normally even xn monensin-treated cells [35, 37, 68, 121] . However, these observations could be explained as well if processing of ollgosacchande chains of different secreted glycoprotelns occurred at different sites, only some of which were sensitive to monensln [53, 68] .",

For example, under normal conditions, proteins of developing seeds accumulate in a central vacuole which then partitions into smaller units of storage protein (I.e, the protein bodies). However, when treated with monensin, the Golgi apparatus-derived transport of the protein VlClhn in pea cotyledon was redirected from the vacuole to the plasmalemma and the newly synthesized viclhn was released from the cotyledon cells to accumulate between the plasmalemma and cell wall [112] Monensin lnhibmon of Golgi apparatus function ~s sufficiently well established [25, 42, 61, 121] that the phenomenon is used widely as one criterion for verifying the passage of a biochemical entity through the Golgi apparatus.

            "text": "Swelling of Golgi apparatus cisternae observed in the electron microscope following fixation with glutaraldehyde is, perhaps, the most consistent visual in vitro demonstration of a monensin-mduced effect on a membranous cell compartment [34, 41, 61, 121, [148] [149] [150] The swollen Clsternae usually appear devoid of contents by electron microscopy (Figs. 3 and 4) but an electron-dense substance may be precipitated through the osmium tetroxlde-zmc iodide reaction (unpubhshed data) Although all Clsternae of the Golgi apparatus may swell in response to monensin ( Fig. 3 and 5A) , the major effect appears to be associated with the mature, or trans, parts of the Golgi apparatus stacks (Figs 4 and 5B) [148, 149, 152 ]_ Gnffiths and co-workers [118] showed that monensm inhibited the transport of viral membrane proteins from medml to trans Golg~ apparatus cisternae, thus indicating a monensln block between medial and trans cisternae Monensm also blocked tlamrmng of the high mannose bound to the viral membrane proteins and their conversion to complex ohgosacchartdes Similarly, Niemann and co-workers [72] found that monensm blocked glycosylation of E1 glycoproteln of corona virus in infected mouse cells. Srinlvas and co-workers [68] reported failure to process simple endo-H-sensitive to complex endo-H-reslstant ohgosacchandes and reduced efficiency of cleavage of the PrENV glycoprotein precursor to gp70 for Evehne mouse cells infected with Friend munne leukemia virus These findings indicate a block prior to entry into the Golgl apparatus Also, m cultured hepatoma cells, transport of vesicular stomatltis wrus (VSV) G protein was arrested prior to acquisition of endo-H resistance, suggesting a block early in the processing pathway [42] . Strous and co-workers [49] showed that monensin affects primarily the galactosyltransferase-containlng c~sternae of the Golgi apparatus based on studies of the metabohsm, localization, and biosynthesis of N-and O-linked oligosaccharides of galactosyltransferase in HeLz cells. The accumulation of incompletely processed glycoproteins indicates either an up-stream accumulation of secretory materials behind a Golgl apparatus blockage by monensm [44] or a monensin block near the exit site from endoplasmlc reticulum [68] . Monensin effects on Golgi apparatus have been observed in a wide range of plant and animal species and appear to be a universal response to the topxcal applicatton of monensln. As pointed out above, monensln action is exerted on the trans half of the stacked clsternae (Fig 4) , often near the point of exit of secretory vesicles [1, 34, 61, 57, 118, 149, 152] or, especially at low monensm concentrations or short exposure times, sometimes m the rmdreglon of the stacked cisternae [148, 149] . Intracellular transport may be blocked [35, 42, 49, 68, 117, 121] , often wlthxn rmnutes after exposure to monensln [88, 106, 125, 152, 154] . Swollen units usually accumulate near the Golgi apparatus [147, 152] ",

            "text": "A monensm effect is quite rapid in both animal and plant cells; 1 e, changes in Golgi apparatus have been observed after only 2-5 rmn of treatment [85, 149, 152, 155] . These early effects have been documented particularly well is suspension cultures of carrot (Daucus carota L ) [152] . When carrot cells were exposed to monensln at 10 -5 M (which IS approxamately the minimum concentration that will elicit a strong monensm response m plants), production of secretory vesicles ceased and, almost Immediately, an increased number of Clsternae in the dlctyosome stacks was observed. An average of one additional clsterna per stack was formed within the first 2-4 mln of monensin treatment and, in some experiments, a second Clsterna was formed within about 6 man. These effects occurred without significant swelling of cisternae. Thereafter, vacuoles, representing intact swollen Clsternae, began to accumulate in the cytoplasm at a rate of about one every 3-4 min (Fig. 6) . The mechanism postulated for this momentary increase of d~ctyosome clsternae was that monensln, acting on the trans pole of the dictyosome, blocked normal formation [125] for details of procedure) The two samples differed onl~\u00a2 m that the one dlustrated m {A) was adjacent to a 'natural' (1 e_ uncut) surface of the hver lobe, whereat (B) was from a cell near the 'cut' surface of the tissue slice In both instances, come Golgx apparatus (GA) clsternae were sv~ollen, however, m (A) swelling was progresse~e from cls to trans pole (direction of arrow) whereas m (B) swelling was t.onfined to the trans c~sterna Note that m~tochondrm (M) were condensed of secretory vesicles but did not block the formation of new Clsternae at the cis face of the apparatus However, as the trans clsternae began to swell, the swollen Clsternae were eventually released as intact units that neither fragmented nor integrated (fused) with other cellular constituents (e.g., plasma membrane). With the scale producing green alga Pyramimonas lnconstans, exposures of 1 to several hours to monensln resulted m disorientation of the Golg~ apparatus and disruption of scale morphogenesls [94] . These effects were reversible More recent studies indicate that a similar pattern of swelling and accumulation of clsternae in the cytoplasm occurs in cultured animal cells [151] . When H-2 hepatoma cells were treated for varying times with 10 ~ to 10 5 M monensin, one swollen Clsterna per stack of clsternae was produced after 6-8 rain of treatment During tlus time, approximately one additional clsterna per stack was formed (Fig. 7, inset) . As the Clsternae veslculated, vacuoles began to appear m the cytoplasm These large swollen vacuoles were formed at the rate of one sin concentrations, the vacuoles were larger and appeared more rapidly than at low concentrations of monensln but the kinetics of vacuole formation were qualitatively similar. However, by 2 h following treatment with 10 -6 M momensin, all Clsternae of the Golgi apparatus appeared as vacuoles. The swollen trans compartments that accumulate in the Golgl apparatus region with monensln inhibition may contain regmns that are clathrin coated; e.g., condensing secretory material (prolnsuhn) in pancreatic cells [43] . The response of Golgi apparatus of hver slices to monensin was qualitatively similar to that with hepatoma cells in culture [154] . With liver shces, a fraction enriched in vacuoles was isolated and demonstrated to contain the trans Golgl apparatus markers, galactosyltransferase, and thiarmne pyrophosphatase, in ratios sirmlar to those of Golgl apparatus proper [154] . In barley aleurone layers, the a-amylase and acid phosphatase activities that accumulated within aleurone cells following treatment with monensin, were localized in cellular components with buoyant densities intermediate between endoplasrmc reticulum and mitochondria and cosedimented with latent inoslne diphos-phatase activity, a putative Golgi apparatus marker in plants [45] . Heupke and Robinson [46] reported a shift to higher density of Golgi apparatus membranes from monensin-treated barley cells, a response no obvious from work with mammalian cells. The Golgi apparatus Clsternae that accumulated behind a monensin block in Semlikl Forest virus-infected BHK cells bound viral nucleocapsids, and the resulting increase in density permltted their separation by gradient centnfugatlon from other Golgi apparatus elements [146] .",

            "text": "Monensin apparently causes swelhng of Golgi apparatus cisternae through a Na+-in/H+-out exchange across the membranes leading to a net uptake of Na ++ CI and entry of water [157, 158] Evidence in support of this concept was provided by studies with Isolated chromaffin granules which lysed readily after brief exposure to monensln in Na +-or K+-contalnlng ISOtOmc media For swelling to occur, the membrane must normally be lmpermeant to cations as is known for the chromaffin granule_ The chromaffln granule membrane contains a H+-ATPase which is electrogenexc and, in the presence of a permeant anion, acidifies the granule interior to pH 5 5_ Thus, the operation of this pump in the presence of monensin drives net salt uptake [158] . To test whether net salt uptake driven by the presence of a proton gradient also would explain the monensininduced swelling of Golgi apparatus cisternae, wild-carrot cells in suspension culture were treated with drugs and inhlbltors known to interfere with proton gradients [156] Monensin-induced swelling of Golgl apparatus in sJtu could be inhibited by the protonophore, carbonylcyanlde-p-trlfluoromethoxyphenylhydazone (FCCP), But was only little affected by the inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, quercetln, or by the lysosomotropic amines, chloroquine, and ammonia. Cyanide also dramatically decreased swelling, and arsenate (with prolonged treatments) reduced the number of swollen cisternae Organic acids, by providing a readily permeable counterlon, promoted monensln-lnduced swelhng These data imply that the monensin-induced swelling of Golgi apparatus cisternae involves a proton gradmnt at or near the mature poles of the Golgi apparatus Because monensin induces a 1 \" 1 Na+/H + exchange, and since the Van't Hoft factors for H + and Na + are practically the same [159] , the osmolanty of the cell content should not increase to cause swelhng without a net proton influx One explanation would be that the pH of Golgi apparatus vesicles is highly regulated Proton translocatlng ATP hydrolyzing enzymes (H +-ATPases) are associated with several components of cells that develop acidic intermrs such as endosomes, coated vesicles, lysosomes, and trans Golgl apparatus Clsternae [160] . Ewdence for the presence of an H +-ATPase has been the demonstration of ATP-dependent vesicle acxdlflatlon in Golgl apparatus isolated from rodent liver [161] [162] [163] , corn coleoptlles [164] , and sycamore cells [165] Acldificatmn was demonstrated both by [lac]methylamlne uptake and by spectrophotometric assays of amd-quenched dye fluorescence (Acridine orange, Neutral red, or Quinacrme) Several lines of evidence confine the Golgi apparatus H +-ATPase to the trans cisternae. As emphasized in the preceding section, the early in SltU effects of monensm are frequently localized to the trans faces of the Golgl apparatus The resultant swelling, whmh is proposed Io be due to the accumulation of osmotically active ions in exchange for protons [156.166] , occurs predominantly m trans Clsternae Additionally, a basic congener o] dmltrophenol (3-(2,4-dlnitroanlhn o)-3'-amlno-Nmethyldlpropylamine, DAMP), which concentrates m acidic compartments as shown in fibroblasts by lmmunocytochemlstry is present onl) 15 Clsternae and vesicles associated with the trans faces of the Golgl apparatus [84] Moreover, DAMP rapidly leaves these compartments when cells are incubated with monensm, thus further indicating that accumulation of DAMP is due to the acid pH Some involvement of a low pH compartment is evidenced by the observatmn that some monensln effects on processing, ke, proteolytlc conversion of proalbumln [64] , are mimicked by amines However, in promyelocytlc leukemia cells, processing of myeloperoxldase, while blocked by both monensln and chloroqulne, was not affected by NH~ cations, thus indicating that processmg is not necessarily influenced by pH-dependent mechanisms [67] These results were interpreted as indicative of processing in Golgl apparatus based on inhibition of transport by monensin and chloroquine rather than processing m lysosomes and other late, acidic compartments involving a pH-dependent mechanism [671 Confirmatmn of a trans location of the H ~-ATPase has come from free-flow electrophoresis separations of Golgl apparatus yielding ClS, medial, and trans compartments m fractions of diffenng electrophoretic mobility [154, 167] _ In these separatmns, proton pumping activity was found exclusively in the most electronegative fractions coming from the trans-most Goigl apparatus re-gion_ Gnfflng and Ray [166] have offered the suggestion that acldificatmn of Clsternal lumlna may be part of an osmotic mechanism to compress and flatten the cisternae The latter, for example, might aid in the transfer of content into secretory vesmles. The inward pumping of protons would tend to favor the exit of Na + and K + out of the Clsternae Furthermore, as the pH falls, those monovalent cations remaining would tend to combine with acidm groups of the Golgx apparatus membranes, further reducing the osmolanty of the Clsternal content relative to that of the external cytoplasm. Thus, water would be driven osmotically out of the clsternae to both compress the Clsternae, as seen along a pronounced ClS to trans gradient for plant Golgl apparatus [168] , and, perhaps, to account for the condensation of secretory materials m condensing vacuoles and other trans Golgi apparatus compartments (e.g, ref 169 ).",

Some portion of the material synthesized is released from the monensm-mhabited cells and this material frequently exhibits an abnormal type of posttranslational modification. For example, those proteoglycans from chicken embryo chondrocytes secreted m the presence of monensln are vastly undersulfated [37, 39, 74, 75] . Thus, membrane and secreted molecules leaving the cell following a monensin block appear to have been denied the full range of processing enzymes they would normally encounter during transit through the cell However, whether the incompletely processed molecules bypass one or more parncular lntracelhilar compartments (eg, the Golgi apparatus), or whether they pass through functionally incomplete compartments, remains to be determined. During maturation of Uukunieml virus m baby hamster kidney cells, monensin appeared to mhibit a terminal step of virus assembly, but not the expression of virus membrane glycoproteins G 1 and G 2 at the cell surface. These findings suggest that both G 1 and G 2 could enter a functional transport pathway in the presence of monensm that bypasses the trans Golgi apparatus compartment to become expressed at the cell surface [99] . Evidence for a Golgi apparatus bypass has been presented m liver where secretory hpoproteins may move directly from endoplasnuc reticulum to the cell surface without direct Golgl apparatus involvement [184, 185] .",

An even more striking observation was that following the monensm block, secretory proteins accumulated in an endo-H-sensitive form, whereas, membrane proteins were already endo-H-resistant. This strongly implies that membrane and secretory proteins are not m the same compartment initially and would support the concept of peripheral input of secretory proteins into the secretory vesicles of the Golgi apparatus, at least in hver [42, 186, 187] Alonso and Compans [103] provided evidence for two distract pathways of glycoprotein transport in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells only one of which was blocked by Monensm However, in baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cells, both influenza virus and VSV maturation were sensitive to monensin. The VSV particles were synthesized m both MDCK and BHK21 cells, but transport to the cell surface was blocked only in the MDCK cells Thus, there appear to be two distinct pathways of transport of glycoproteins to the plasma membrane in MDCK cells, only one of which is blocked by monensln There is no information on the nature of the alternative transport vesicle that carries mfhienza virus to the cell surface of MDCK cells if, in fact, a vesicle is involved.",

This in turn would prevent recycling of receptors and membrane and eventually bring endocytosls to a halt due, not necessardy to an inhibition of the uptake processes per se, but perhaps, to blockage of an internal step very similar to that believed to be blocked at the GolN apparatus.",

Clearly, monensm does not interfere with the uptake and binding of particles at the cell surface. Monensm is ineffective against activities that occur at the cell surface. Hedm and Thyberg [76] showed that uptake of IgG prebound to the cell surface was unaffected by monensln Similar findings have been made in studies of receptor-medmted endocytosls of various other ligands [78, 80, 83] . However, monensm may secondarily affect mternahzation through depletion of monensln-sens~tive receptor sites at the cell surface. This would occur if the cell surface receptors are recycled back into the cell and then blocked in the post-Golgi region by monensin so that they could not return to the cell surface [63, 80, 88] . Thus, monensin inhibition of endocytlc events seems to be at the site of transfer from endocytlc vesicles to lysosomes [40, 63, 76, 93] or, in monensin-sensltive endosomes, inhibition of the dissociation of ligand-receptor complexes [81] ",

However, in plants, and to a lesser extent animals, swelhng is influenced by the fixative used to preserve the cells Specifically, morphological evidence of swelhng is less (in animal Golgl apparatus) or nonexistent (in plant Golgl apparatus) when the tissues are fixed in potassium permanganate as compared to fixation in ghitaraldehyde/osmium tetroxade [122] . These effects could be due either to fixation artifacts or to differences between plant and animal Golgl apparatus (e.g, Ref_ 168) This problem was evaluated by comparing the images of Golgl apparatus preserved by various chemical fixatives as well as preservation by freezing and low temperature substitution in acetone and osmium tetroxade. Presumably, the image following freeze sub-stitUtlOn would reflect the true ultrastructure more closely than the image following chemical fixation. The results of freeze substitution in both animal cells [191] and maize root (Figs 8A and B) , show swollen Golgi apparatus c~sternae following monensln exposure in a pattern similar to that observed after glutaraldehyde/ osmium tetroxide fixation [192] . However, using videoenhanced light microscopy and cultured bovine mammary epithelial cells, a marked swelling response to monensln was observed only after the addition of glutaraldehyde fixative to the monensln-incubated cells (Morr6, D J., Mollenhauer, H H., Spring, H., Trendlenberg, M, Morr6, D M. and Kartenbeck, J, unpubhshed data)_ Thus, whether monensin-lnduced swelhng occurs m VlVO or is in response to aldehyde fixations remains an important questiion.",

Horses, ponies and other equine species are particularly sensitive to monensln poisoning [12,209. 214] . The median lethal dosage (LDso) for the horse Js 2-4 mg monensin per kg body weight compared to 50-80 mg per kg body weight for cattle and 200 mg per kg body weight for poultry [12, 214, 215] In mammals, the physical signs of monensln tOXlCOSlS commonly include anorexia, diarrhea, depression, sweating, ataxm, palpitations of the heart, and sudden death following exercise [204, 205, 209, 211, [214] [215] [216] [217] Stiffness of hindquarters and swollen gluteus muscles [210, 211] , elevated pulse rate [211, 217, 218] , and ECG abnormalities [207, 208, 214, 217] also have been reported In fowl, the outstanding signs of monensln tOXlCOSlS are drowsiness, excessive thirst, anorexia, depression and paralysis [205, 212, 213] Marked congestion in a variety of organs also has been noted [205] Severely poisoned birds may die in sternal recombency [205] . Routine clinical tests on serum from horses poisoned by monensm may show abnormally high values for blood urea nitrogen, total billrubin, creatlne kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate armnotransferase [204,207 209,211] However, chnlcal manifestations are often variable makang interpretation and diagnosis difficult. Moreover, serum levels of sodium, potassium, chlorine, calcium, phosphorus, and urea may remain at near-normal levels following monensin treatment [211] _ In poisoned mammals and fowl, generalized congestion, hemorrhage, and macroscopic injury to striated muscle [210, 211, 214, 219] , spleen [205, 212] , lung [212] , liver [209] , and kidney [209, 211, 212, 220, 221] have been noted. The most consistent macroscopic observation in ponies, cattle, pigs and fowl, has been cardiac myocyte degeneration and vacuollzatlon [150, 208, 217, [219] [220] [221] [222] [223] [224] [225] In animals poisoned with relatively high doses of monensin, an initial condensation of heart mltochondria is often seen (Fig 9) However, with longer exposure times, some mitochondria swell and vacuolate with an almost total loss of matnx substance (Fig 9) _ Intracnstae spaces generally remain unchanged with swelling being restricted to the mitochondrial matrix This is followed by loss or dilution of matnx components and a reduction in size of cnstae so that the rmtochondna appear as empty vacuoles with residual cristae Typically, only some mItochondrla In a particular fiber become swollen and appear as vacuoles, and Fig 9 Section of left ventricle from a rat treated wath a single mtraperitoneal mjecaon of 40 mg monensm per kg body weight Most rmtochondna (M) were either condensed or swollen In swollen rmtochondna, cnstae (arrowheads) were greatly reduced in extent but, otherwise, were of approxamately normal ttuckness Thas dosage level (e_g, 40 mg monensln per kg body wexght) is quite tugh for rats and often resulted m significant generahzed damage to the muscle fiber as dlustrated in the lower part of the rmcrograph However, rmtochondnal swelhng (but not condensauon) may occur as well at lower monensln dosages, even when no fiber damage can be identified ultrastructurally Swelling and vacuohzatlon of mltochondna are progresslve with time whereas rmtochondnal condensation was dose-dependent and often occurred rapidly , a few were normal (arrowhead), but most were rmldly condensed Swollen tmtochondna always appeared randomly distributed through a fiber although significant differences m rmtochondnal swelling were often noted between fibers (e g, see Fig_ 12) these are randomly distributed throughout the fiber (Fig. 10) . We have identified early stages of mitochondrial vacuolation and swelling in both the rat and pony (unpublished data), but these mitochondria were seldom plentiful, suggesting that transition to the vacuolated state, once started, was relatively rapid Non-swollen mitochondria may appear condensed, especially after exposure to high levels of monensin ( Fig. 9 and 10 ). Granulation of mitochondna ( Fig. 11 ) was observed only occasionally and those granules that were present appeared similar to the tncalclum phosphate granules often associated with normal mitochondria [226, 227] . However, whether monensln-lnduced granules contain Ca 2 ~ has not been determined. Granules like these have been observed in lschermc and reperfused hearts and are considered indicative of calcium overload [228] [229] [230] [231] _ Ca 2+ overload may be a potential cause of cell death or cellular dysfunction in ischerma [228, [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] although the effects are reversible if the cell is not too severely damaged [228, 229] Exaggerated matochondrial swelling has also been observed immediately following reperfuslon of hearts rendered lschemlc by occluding blood flow for a few minutes [228, 229] Whether excess mitochondrial Ca 2+ occurs as a result of monensin is not clear Under appropriate condiuons, either monensin or Na + in excess can block Ca 2+ accumulation and promote its release from both mitochondrla and sarcoplasrmc reticulum over a broad range of monensin and Na + concentrations [20, 24, 238] It is probable that the release of Ca 2+ by monensln can occur as the result of an increase in cytoplasmac Na + from a monensin shuttle although monensin (at relatwely high concentrations) has been shown to release Ca 2+ directly m a Na+-lndependent manner from cardiac sarcoplasmic retlculum [24] In all probability, however, monensin is not present in myocytes at high concentrations since swelling of Golgl apparatus cxsternae (a characteristic response to monensin) ~s never observed in these cells. The picture is further comphcated by the fact that Ca 2+ release patterns may vary according to type of cell (e g., white vs red muscle cells [239] ) as well as the availability of extracellular Ca 2+ [110] . Although not related to this report, it may be of some interest to note that both mitochondrlal condensation and granulation are much more intense in X-537A-treated animals (and cultured cells as well) than in comparable animals (or cells) treated with monensin [21] _ The percentage of affected mltochondrla vaned markedly between muscle types and species of animal. Analyses of striated muscle m ponies showed that there was a much greater (50 100-times) hkehhood of finding altered mltochondrla in heart tissues than m diaphragm or appendicular muscle [224] A similar relationship existed in rats except that most swollen mitochondria were m the &aphragm [224] . Some antibioUcs (e g, tiamuhn and avoparcm) may act synergistically with monensln to induce shifts in the distribution of swollen mltochondrIa [240] and other cellular damage. Differences in distribution patterns of swollen mltochondrla also were observed between red and white muscle fibers of the rat diaphragm [224] . Red and white fibers were dffferentmted structurally by size, mltochondrlal content, and Z-band configuration [34, [241] [242] [243] Swollen matochondrm were present in all fiber types when the number of affected rmtochondna was small. However, when large numbers of swollen matochondrm were present, the dxsmbutlon pattern was heavily skewed toward the white muscle fibers (Fig_ 12). A differential effect of monensln was also noted by Van Vleet and co-workers [217] who observed in swine severe damage m the diaphragm, vastus lateralls, sem~tendlnosus, triceps and intercostal muscles: moderate damage m longissimus lumborum muscle, and little (or minimal) damage in tongue. Damage was greatest m muscles containing a high proportion of type 1 fibers These distribution patterns, coupled with the characteristic form of the degenerating rmtochondrla, are not common observations and, therefore, may be strong indtcatots of monensin poisoning in animals_ Swollen rmtochondrla have not been observed in any of the nonmuscle cells of the heart, diaphragm, or appendicular tissues or in hver, adrenal, or kidney cells Thus, monensm adrmnistered to mammals in VlVO tends to induce rmtochondrial changes only m selected tissues and/or types of muscle fibers The mechanisms for these rmtochondrlal changes and reasons for the specificity are not known. These problems are compounded by the fact that matochondnal condensation, but not subsequent swelling and degeneration, occurs in cells exposed topically to monensin.",

Generalized fiber and cell degeneration may occur following monensin poisoning [211, 217, 223] . The extent of monensin-induced injuries appears to be time and dosage dependent. If death occurs shortly after monensin exposure, there may be httle or no recognizable evidence of pathologtcal change, at least in liver, kidney, and striated muscle. Generalized necrosis appears to occur most often when monensln is administered over long periods of time. Even with single doses of monensin, structural aberrations in striated muscle develop progressively over several days and then regress if the animal survives the imtial insult (unpublished data). We have not observed permanent injury in either striated muscle or liver of monensin-treated rats although such effects have been noted in other animals [211] .",

            "text": "Many of the effects on striated muscle attributed to monensxn occur also with other lonophores Irrespective of their ion specxficlties [21, 244] This implies, again, that Na + is not the direct cause of muscle perturbation but, rather, that the iomc imbalance resulting from the intracellular influx of Na + triggers other cellular responses that lead to the observed perturbations. Monensin is known to both inhibit and promote Ca 2+ accumulation in myocytes depending on the absence or availability, respectively, of external Ca 2 + stores [109, 110] ; alter Na + gradient-dependent Ca 2+ transfer through the basolateral plasma membranes of rat small intestine [245] ; increase myocardial calcium activity [246] , inhibit Ca 2+ accumulation by cardiac macrosomes or cause release of accumulated Ca 2+ stores [24] ; and release Ca 2+ from macrosomes [147, 247] . Digitalis and other cardiac glycosides (which increase myocardial contractility) appear to act by altering intracellular Na + concentration through Inhibition of membrane-bound Na +-, K+-actlvated adenosine triphosphatase which secondarily results in an increase in mtracellular Ca 2+ [see 147] . Calcium ionophores such as lasalocld and A23187 have been suggested as potential probes for studying the effects of calcium imbalance on myocardial function [9] . In retrospect, monensin affects the myocardlum in much the same way as do the calcium lonophores and, in some instances, to an even greater extent [9] . These observations suggest that the xonotropic effects of monensln may be partially indirect; e g., through release of histamine and endogenous amines [4] , or stimulation of synthesis and/or release of prostaglandln [4, 25, 248] . Thus, Na + balance plays an indirect but critical role in modulating myocardial function However, a calcium-independent catecholamine depleting action of monensin in cultured rat pheochromocytoma cells [249] and m bovine adrenal medullary cells and chromaffln granules [250] suggests that monensln may also play a direct role in altering cellular function. Similarly, Sutko and co-wor~kers [251] showed that both monensxn and mgencin produce their effects in guinea pig atria by direct action as well as by releasing catecholamines from tissue stores.",

In biological systems, these complexes are freely soluble In the lipid components of membranes and, presumably, diffuse or shuttle through the membranes from one aqueous membrane interface to the other. The net effect for monensin is a trans-membrane exchange of sodium ions for protons. However, the interaction of an ionophore with biologl-cal membranes, and ItS ionophorlc expression, is highly dependent on the blochemcial configuration of the membrane itself One apparent consequence of this exchange is the neutralization of acidic lntracellular compartments such as the trans Golgi apparatus Clsternae and associated elements, lysosomes, and certain endosomes. This is accompanied by a disruption of trans Golgi apparatus Clsternae and of lysosome and acidic endosome function. At the same time, Golgl apparatus Clsternae appear to swell, presumably due to osmotic uptake of water resulting from the inward movement of ions Monensin effects on Golga apparatus are observed in cells from a wide range of plant and animal species The action of monensin is most often exerted on the trans half of the stacked Clsternae, often near the point of exit of secretory vesicles at the trans face of the stacked cisternae, or, especially at low monensln concentrations or short exposure times, near the rmddle of the stacked cisternae. The effects of monensln are quite rapid in both animal and plant cells; l.e, changes in Golgl apparatus may be observed after only 2-5 min of exposure It is implicit in these observations that the uptake of osmotically active cations IS accompanied by a concornltant efflux of H + and that a net influx of protons would be required to sustain the ionic exchange long enough to account for the swelling of Clsternae observed in electron rmcrographs.",

Among its advantages are the low concentrations at which inhibitions are produced (001-1.0 /~M), a minimum of troublesome side effects (e g., little or no change of protein synthesis or ATP levels) and a reversible action. Because the affinity of monensIn for Na + is ten times that for K +, its nearest competitor, monensxn mediates primarily a Na+-H + exchange Monensin has little tendency to bind calcium.",

However, the interactions between monensm and the tissues of the host animal are not well understood although the severe toxicological manifestations of monensln poisoning are well known Equine species are particularly susceptible to monensm poisoning, and a common effect of monensln poisoning is vacuolizatton and/or swelling of rmtochondna m striated muscle Other pathological injuries to striated muscle, spleen, lung, hver and kidney also have been noted A con-sIstent observation is cardiac myocyte degeneration as well as vacuohzation Differences m cellular response resulting from exposure to monensln (t e, Golgi apparatus swelling in cultured cells, isolated tissues, and plants vs. mltochondrial swelling m animals fed monensln) suggest that myocardial damage is due either to a monensln metabohte or is a secondary response to some other derivation However, as pointed out by Bergen and Bates [26] , the underlying mode of action of lonophores is on transmembrane ton fluxes which dissipate cation and proton gradients Consequently, some or all of the observed monensin effects m VlVO m animals could be secondary phenomena caused by disruption of normal membrane physiology resulting from altered ion fluxes.",
