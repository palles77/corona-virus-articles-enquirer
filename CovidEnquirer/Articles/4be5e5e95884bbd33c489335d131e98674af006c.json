Mutations can have, on the one hand, an environmental advantage and, on the other hand, a fitness cost (Soderholm et al., 2006) . A typical example of this dual effect is escape mutations from CD8+ T cells (CTLs) in viruses. While these mutations can lead to a higher survival probability, they often lead to a lower probability of producing functional virions. We here use bioinformatics tools to analyze the relation between the frequency of escape mutations and the organisms' complexity.",

These epitopes are presented in the binding groove of MHC class I molecules located on the surface of these cells (Williams et al., 2002) . When an appropriate CTL encounters a host cell expressing such epitopes, the host cell is rapidly destroyed along with its hosted virus (Aebischer et al., 1991; Bowen and Walker, 2005; McMichael and Phillips, 1997) . This leads to an evolutionary pressure on viruses to avoid this detection in order to survive and infect new cells. Peptide binding to MHC-I groove requires well-defined binding motifs. Only a few percent of the possible peptides have such a motif, limiting the number of possible epitopes in every protein to approximately 1-2% of all possible nine-mers for a given HLA allele (Yewdell, 2006) . The HLA polymorphism challenges viruses with a changing environment that may result in back-and-forth (toggling) escape mutations (Delport et al., 2008) and thus limit the fixation of mutation. However, mutations in the cleavage sites of the highly conserved proteasome or in positions that binds to conserved HLA motifs can lead to a removal of epitopes at the population level. Thus, in principle, a very limited number of properly positioned mutations can completely hide a viral protein from CTLs.",

These mutations have the obvious advantage of reducing the probability that a CTL would kill the virus. The balance between the fitness cost and the advantage obtained by escape mutation leads to a non-uniform epitope density distribution among different viral proteins. We have recently shown, for example, that proteins expressed early in the viral life cycle have a lower epitope density than proteins expressed late in the viral life cycle (Agranovich et al., 2011; Vider-Shalit et al., 2009a , and that proteins with a low copy number have more epitopes than proteins with a high copy number (Maman et al., 2011a) . Here, we study the relation between the accumulation of escape mutations and the viral complexity (as shall be further defined). Specifically, we test whether the (dis)advantage of a given mutation is determined by the mutation itself or whether it is related to the complexity of the entire protein or perhaps even the entire organism.",

            "text": "The relation between complexity and selection was initially studied by the pioneering work of Fisher in 1930 (Fisher, 1930 . Fisher proposed that as the dimensionality of the phenotype increases, the probability of a mutation being beneficial decreases due to its pleiotropic effects and different dimensions of the phenotype. The phenotype dimensionality is defined by the number of organism's parts (phenotypic characters -denoted hereafter as n). Kimura and Orr then expanded Fisher's work and showed that Fisher underestimated the cost of complexity by not incorporating the lower fixation probability of mutations with a limited phenotypic effect following the effect of stochastic drift (Kimura, 1983; Orr, 2000) . Orr (2000) further showed that the average fitness increase rate is inversely proportional to n for small and medium n and much faster for large n. In other words, the adaptation rate of complex organisms is lower than the one of simpler ones. Welch and Waxman (2003) examined the robustness of Orr's model by introducing different mechanisms (such as varying magnitude of mutations, modularity (Wagner, 1996; Wagner and Altenberg, 1996; Baatz and Wagner, 1997 ) and a constant mean mutational chance per phenotypic character). They showed that the relation between the complexity and adaptation rate is robust to most variations of the model. Gillespie (1994 Gillespie ( , 1984 Gillespie ( , 1983 ) extended Fisher's model and proposed the mutational landscape model. Orr (2003 Orr ( , 2002 further extended his work and found different patterns that characterize the adaptation of DNA sequences. His model was tested using single stranded DNA viruses (Rokyta et al., 2005) . These studies were done in the regime of weak selection and low mutation rate.",

The difference between viruses infecting humans and viruses infecting other species suggests that these results are indeed due to selection against epitope presentation on human HLA molecules and not to properties of short and long proteins in general or generic features of small and large viruses. One could argue that this effect is due to the similarity at the sequence level between proteins in the group of viruses. However, even when all viruses belonging to the same group are clustered to a single point, the relation between the number of proteins and the average SIR score can be clearly observed.",

The algorithms' quality was systematically validated using epitope databases and was found to induce low FP and FN error rates. Different alleles present different set of epitopes. Thus, the analysis is first performed at the single allele level. For instance, if a sequence from a viral protein X has 4 epitopes that can bind the groove of the HLA allele A\u20440201 and a random sequence with a similar length and a typical viral amino acid distribution is expected to have 10 HLA A\u20440201 epitopes, then the SIR score of X for HLA A\u20440201 would be 0.4 (4/10). We have computed epitopes for the 39 most common HLA alleles and weighted the results according to the allele frequency in the Caucasian population (Newell et al., 1996) . The computation of the SIR scores can be performed through our web-server at http://peptibase.cs.biu.ac.il/index.html.",

The method finds the optimal combination of binary classification of peptides known to bind or not to bind the MHC molecule, a linear regression based on the measured affinities of peptides with a known IC50 or EC50 binding concentrations and a guess (often based on information on similar alleles). Solving this optimization problem results in a Position Weight Matrix for each HLA alleles. These matrices estimate the contribution of each amino acid at each position to the total binding strength. The accuracy of MHC binding prediction for the vast majority of MHC-I alleles in the MLVO is over 0.95 (with AUC of over 0.98). As in all other cases, the SIR results presented are an average weighted over alleles of the ratio between the computed epitope density and the one expected in a random sequence. The SIR scores of the viral proteins in this study are presented in Supplementary Material Table S1 .",

The way the cutoff is determined is based on the competition for the presentation on a limited number of MHC molecules. For example, an allele such as B\u20442705 is expected to present a very large number of epitopes from self proteins. Thus a viral protein with a large number of epitopes would have to compete with a similarly high number of epitopes in human proteins. While this approach may lead to the exclusion of some real viral epitopes, it should not affect the ratio between the number of computed epitopes in human and non-human viruses.",
