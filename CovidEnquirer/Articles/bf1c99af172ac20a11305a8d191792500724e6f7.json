Analysis of the viral RNA was carried out by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. Fourteen electrophoretypes were identified. A single dominant electrophoretype was found during the first months of the rotavirus seasonal outbreak. In contrast, a large variety of RNA patterns were observed during the latter portion of the study period. Subgrouping of rotavirus isolates by a doublesandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal-detecting antibodies showed that all strains belonged to subgroup II. Mixed rotavirus electrophoretypes appeared in 4 cases (8.16 070).",

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of rotavirus dsRNA, in conjunction with a sensitive silver staining technique Submitted November 5, 1986 , accepted February 9, 1987. [6] , has proven to be a very useful method for the identification and distinction of rotavirus isolates. Human rotaviruses show a large diversity in their segmented genomic patterns, and electrophoretic analysis has been established as a valuable means of studying the epidemiology of rotavirus infections [10, 12, 15, 17] .",

One of the electrophoretic migration patterns, Ib,IIb,IIIb,IVa, accounted for the largest proportion (36.7 070) of all rotaviruses identified. Five isolates obtained during the first two months of the study period had this electrophoretic pattern. In contrast, strains collected during the following months had a large variety of RNA patterns, although the electrophoretype that had appeared first occurred more frequently than the others. During the final months, it was difficult to find any predominant electrophoretype. In an attempt to more precisely characterize the rotavirus isolates, we determined their serological subgroups using two subgrouping monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA test. The specificity of both monoclonal antibodies was assessed by titering them against dilutions of two known subgroup I and subgroup II strains. The reactivity appeared to be highly specific. As expected, all rotavirus isolates studied were identified as subgroup II, with OD values higher than 1.200 when a monoclonal antibody specific for this subgroup was used as the detecting antibody. With the rotavirus subgroup-I-specific monoclonal antibody, OD values between 0.165 and 0.380 were obtained ( fig. 2) . Capture antibody was a hyperimmune rabbit anti-rotavirus serum .

RESULTS During this survey, rotavirus particles were detected in 65 (25 0/0) of the 260 faecal specimens examined by electron microscopy from October, 1985 to April, 1986. A peak of occurrence was found in December, 1985 and January/February, 1986, when rotaviruses were detected in 52/135 patients (38.51 0/0). Of the 65 rotavirus-positive specimens obtained, 49 (75.38 070) contained a sufficient number of rotaviral particles for RNA analysis. The numbers of rotavirus-positive patients, specimens with demonstrable RNA patterns of the virus and different electrophoretypes detected each month are summarized in table 1. As shown in this table, rotaviruses were found throughout the study period. Adenovirus (3.46 %), astrovirus (1.53 070), coronavirus-like particles (1.15 %) and calicivirus (0.76 %) have also been detected among the 260 faecal samples studied; on 5 occasions, some of these viruses were associated with rotavirus.",
