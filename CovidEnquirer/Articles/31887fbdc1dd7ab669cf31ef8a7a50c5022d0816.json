The most important advantage is structural simplicity, in that lipid-containing viruses possess a small number of virus-coded polypeptides and glycoproteins as membrane components. Sufficient quantities of many enveloped viruses can be purified for detailed biochemical analysis, including primary structure studies of viral membrane proteins like those now underway. Purification procedures are rapid and simple, and a fairly homogeneous population of particles can be obtained free of contaminating cellular membranes. For the simpler lipid-containing viruses, the possibility therefore exists for complete structural determination of a biological membrane, and such information should contribute greatly to an understanding of the molecular details of membrane structure and interactions among membrane components in general.",

Thus by growing different virus types in the same cell it is possible to prepare a membrane in which the protein composition can be varied while the lipid composition remains constant. Similarly, by growing the same virus in a series of different cells, viral membranes are obtained which possess the same set of proteins but vary in lipid composition. These approaches have been useful in studies of lipid-protein interactions in viral membranes (Landsberger et al., 1973) .",

The specificity of labeling by these precursors is shown by the lack of their incorporation into carbohydrate-free polypeptides of the virion (Straws et al., 1970) . The number of distinct glycoprotein species present in the virion varies for various virus groups. As shown in Table 11 , there is also marked variation in the glycoprotein content of virions when expressed as a percent of (Gard et al., 1977) , whereas the data given are for Pichinde virions which contain two glycoproteins.

The results indicate that lipids are distributed asymmetrically, with the majority of the phosphatidylinositol and about half of the phosphatidylcholine in the external half of the bilayer and most of the phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in the inner half. These distributions are thought to reflect a similar distribution in the host cell plasma membrane. Since less than half of the total phospholipids were accessible b y either approach, it was suggested that glycolipids constitute a significant part of the outer monolayer of the viral membrane. The presence of glycolipids in various enveloped viruses has been demonstrated by chemical analyses , and the types of glycolipids present also reflect those of the host cell. Myxoand paramyxoviruses lack neuraminic acid residues in their glycolipids, which again is a likely result of their neuraminidase activity Klenk et al., 1970b) . The reactivity of viral glycolipids toward specific lectins demonstrates that their carbohydrates are exposed on the external surface of the bilayer (Klenk et al., 1972a) .",

All enveloped viruses possess at least one polypeptide species closely associated with the nucleic acid to form a nucleocapsid or core structure, which is termed the nucleocapsid protein. In addition, viruses with helical nucleocapsids possess another major internal protein, termed the membrane protein, that appears to be associated with the internal surface of the lipid bilayer. Most nucleocapsid proteins are not directly involved in interaction with the lipid bilayer, although the nucleocapsids of togaviruses are roughly spherical structures that appear to be closely apposed to the inner surface of the bilayer. The internal membrane (M) proteins of myxo-, paramyxo-, and rhabdoviruses occupy a similar location in the viral envelope. It appears that these proteins are primarily responsible for conferring considerable rigidity on the viral envelope, as compared to that of host cell membranes of similar lipid composition (Stoeffel and Bister, 1975; Landsberger and Compans, 1976; Lenard et al., 1976) .",

These sulfated components are derived from the host cell, since they can be labeled selectively by the growth of cells in 35S0,-containing medium prior to virus infection. In the case of influenza virus, it is possible that these components represent a host cell antigen described to be associated with purified virus particles (Knight, 1944) .

Electron microscope studies of the isolated spike structure have shown that it is a rod-shaped triangular prism approximately 14 nm long and 5 nm wide (Laver and Valentine, 1969) . The HA spike projects radially from the virion envelope, and it is probably a trimer having a MW of about 225,000 daltons (Schulze, 1975; Wiley et al., 1977) . HA glycoproteins can exist in one of two alternative forms: a single polypeptide with a MW of 75,000 daltons designated HA, or two polypeptides with MWs of approximately 50,000 and 25,000 daltons designated HA1 and HA2, respectively. HA, and HA, are proteolytic cleavage products of HA, which remain cross-linked by disulfide bonds (Lazarowitz et al., 1971; Laver, 1971) . The extent of cleavage of HA to HA, and HA2 may vary from none to complete cleavage of all HA polypeptides (Lazarowitz et al., 1973) . The extent of cleavage de-pends upon several factors including the host cell, the virus strain, and the presence or absence of proteases in the culture medium. The cleavage of HA may not be a requirement for infectivity of all virus strains, and spike morphology is not altered detectably by cleavage of HA to HA, and HA,, but recent studies have shown that cleavage enhances the infectivity of some influenza virus strains (Klenk et al., 1975 ; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) .",

The composition of a 50-residue peptide associated with the lipid bilayer, which is removed from the carboxyl terminus of HA2 by bromelain, has been estimated, and 21 of the amino acids are hydrophobic in nature, whereas 14 may be charged (Skehel and Waterfield, 1975) . The carboxyl terminus of this peptide is thought to be buried within the lipid bilayer. The aminoterminal end of HA, seems to extend radially from the virion surface, and a sequence of 10 residues from the amino-terminal end of HA, is highly conserved in both type-A and type-B influenza virions (Skehel and Waterfield, 1975) . The hydrophobicity of HA, suggests that it is similar to other membrane-associated glycoprotein segments (Segrest et al., 1972; Nakashima et al., 1975) , but freeze-fracture studies of the influenza virion indicate that extensive portions of HA and NA do not penetrate through the lipid bilayer (Bachi et al., 1969) . Circular dichroism studies of HA spikes isolated intact and those cleaved from the virion surface may be useful in further defining the secondary structure of the hydrophobic regions.",

About 80% of the carbohydrate attached to viral proteins was shown to be linked to HA; the gly-cosy1 moieties were shown to be comprised of glucosamine, mannose, galactose and fucose at a molar ratio of 6 :4 : 1 : 1, respectively, and the total carbohydrate of HA, determined by chemical means, was estimated to be approximately 12,000 daltons (Laver, 1971) . It was also found that HA, of influenza A virions contains fucose, whereas HA, of influenza B (GL1760) does not . Recently the glycopeptides obtained by pronase digestion of influenza A viruses have been characterized (Schwarz et al., 1977; Nakamura and Compans, 1978b) . Both groups showed that HA possesses type I (oligosaccharide side-chain comprised of glucosamine, mannose, galactose, fucose and sialic acid) and type I1 (oligosaccharides comprised of glucosamine and mannose) glycopeptides, but the distribution of each type on HA, and HA, was shown to depend upon the virus strain. Schwarz et al. (1977) showed that HA, of two avian influenza viruses possessed only type I glycopeptides, whereas both type I and I1 glycopeptides were shown to be present on HA,. However, Nakamura and Compans (197813) using the WSN strain of influenza showed that HA, possessed both type I and I1 glycopeptides whereas HA, contained only type I glycopeptides. Since it is likely that HA, occupies a similar structural location in WSN and avian hemagglutinin proteins, these results suggest that specific amino acid sequences determine whether a type I or type I1 oligosaccharide is added at a particular site on the glycoprotein.",

Schwarz et al.

The molecular weights of type I and I1 glycopeptides of the WSN strain of influenza virus were also found to have approximately this size (Nakamura and Compans, 1978b) . HA glycopeptides of virus grown in MDBK cells were slightly larger in size than those of virus grown in CEF cells. Based upon the estimated carbohydrate content (12,000 daltons) of the HA glycoprotein obtained by Laver (1971) and Schwarz and Klenk (1974) and the size estimates of the type I and I1 glycopeptides of influenza virus grown in MDBK cells, it was estimated that HA, contains a single type I glycopeptide whereas HA, possesses two type I and one or two type I1 oligosaccharide side-chains for the WSN strain (Nakamura and Com pans, 1978b) .",

After protease treatment of VSV a fragment of the G protein was demonstrated to be associated with the intact virion (Mudd, 1974) . More recently, Schloemer and Wagner (1975a) isolated a small nonglycosylated portion of the G protein from the envelope of protease-treated VSV virions. The fragment was found to have a MW of 5200 daltons, approximately equivalent to 50 amino acids. This is similar to the estimated size of the portion of the HA2 protein of the influenza virion thought to be buried within the lipid bilayer. Amino acid analysis of the G-protein fragment showed that it contained a preponderance of hydrophobic amino acids. As is the case for the membrane-associated portions of influenza HA, the hydrophobic fragment of the G protein is long enough to penedate the lipid bilayer. Conclusive evidence for such penetration has not been obtained, but cross-linking experiments with glutaraldehyde suggest that interactions may occur between G proteins and internal M proteins (Brown et d . , 1974) .",

The glycoprotein is 9-10% carbohydrate by weight and contains mannose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and neuraminic acid as the major sugar components, with lesser amounts of N-acetylgalactosamine and fucose (McSharry and Wagner, 1971 ; Huang, 1970. Etchison and Holland, 1974a) . The size and composition of the carbohydrate moieties per VSV glycoprotein are variable, depending upon the cell type in which the virions are grown (Burge and Huang, 1970; Etchison and Holland, 1974a) . Likewise, the sequence of the carbohydrates within the glycosyl side-chains may exhibit cell depen-dence (Moyer and Summers, 1974) . The monosaccharide composition of the oligosaccharide side-chains is similar to that of influenza virus (Etchison and Holland, 1974b) , with the exception that sialic acid is present on the termini. Klenk et aZ. (1970b) demonstrated the presence of sialic acid on the envelope of VS virions by treating the virus with colloidal iron hydroxide which stains sialic acid residues. The stain was shown to bind to the envelope of VSV, whereas it did not bind to influenza virions or paramyxoviruses as shown by electron microscopy. More recent studies have shown that the glycosyl moieties are not terminated by sialic acid when VSV is grown in mosquito cells, because these cells lack sialyl transferase (Schloemer and Wagner, 1975b) .",

Additional information concerning the structure of the glycopeptide was obtained by sequential chemical and enzymatic degradation. These results indicate that the glycopeptides are acidic type I glycopeptides with two or three mannose branches terminating in sialic acid. Moyer and co-workers (1976) have obtained evidence that the glycosyl residues are covalently linked to an asparagine residue of the G protein, and the sequence of the monosaccharides that constitute the oligosaccharide side-chains has been determined (Hunt and Summers, 1976b) .",

The residual peptides have a MW of approximately 5000 daltons; hence they are comprised of about 50 amino acids.

Both infectious and noninfectious viruses are equally adept at causing such cell fusion which sometimes has been termed fusion from without (Bratt and Gallaher, 1972) . In contrast, fusion with low multiplicities of virus has been called fusion from within and is dependent upon replication of the virus.

Several distinct functions have been proposed for this enzyme. It is postulated that neuraminidase-containing virus lodges in the upper respiratory tract and binds to mucin via HA. The glycosyl residues of muchin are terminated by sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) to which HA binds, and one role of the neuraminidase may be to cleave the sialoglycoprotein bond, freeing the bound virion. It is presumed that in this way the virus is released, and that underlying cell receptors are exposed to which HA can attach (Davenport, 1976 ).",

However, the possibility that neuraminidase participates in release of the budding virion from the infected cell surface has gained support from several types of experiments. By using influenza strains with different levels of enzyme activity, it was shown that virus strains having low activity were released from cells more slowly than strains with higher enzyme activity (Palese and Schulman, 1974) . Further, in the presence of antibody to viral neuraminidase, which inhibited enzyme activity, virions were formed but release of virus into culture media was inhibited (Seto and Rott, 1966; Compans et al., 1969; Webster, 1970 More conclusive information on the function of the enzyme has been obtained with temperature-sensitive mutants of influenza virus which are defective in neuraminidase activity . At the nonpermissive temperature, no neuraminidase activity is detected; virus particles are produced by cells, despite the fact that infectivity titers are markedly reduced. However, the virus particles form large aggregates, and in contrast to wild-type virions these particles contain sialic acid as shown by colloidal iron hydroxide staining.",

The classification of virus isolates into specific strains depends largely upon serological procedures, and for enveloped viruses, surface glycoproteins are usually the relevant antigens in such tests. Neutralizing antibodies are usually directed against the viral proteins involved in attachment to receptors, e.g., HA glycoprotein of influenza virus (Webster and Laver, 1975) , G protein of VSV (Wagner, 1975) , gp69/71 of murine leukemia viruses (Fischinger et aZ., 1976; Strand and August, 1976) , gp85 of avian leukosis viruses (Bolognesi, 1974) , and E, of Sindbis virus (Dalrymple et d., 1976) .

Dramatic changes in the antigenic determinants of viral glycoproteins are termed antigenic shifts, and it is these new viruses that cause worldwide influenza pandemics. It has been postulated that antigenic shift may occur because type-A strains of human origin may undergo recombination with type-A strains of avian and animal origin. The antigenic determinants of the new HA or NA are sufficiently different that the human host does not possess immunity, and the virus gains a selective advantage. Interestingly type-B influenza viruses do not undergo antigenic shift. The reason for this may lie in the fact that type-B influenza viruses have not been isolated from other animal species; thus it is probable that the type-B viruses can not undergo similar recombination events (Webster and Laver, 1975) .",

Primarily, three different inhibitors have been used for this purpose: 2-deoxy-~-glucose (2-dG), an analog of glucose which substitutes for mannose, preventing the further addition of monosaccharides to the glycosyl side chain; Dglucosamine, which is thought to inhibit glycosylation at high concentrations by decreasing UTP pools in the cell and subsequent activation of other sugars (Scholtissek, 1971) ; and tunicamycin (TM), a glucosamine-containing antibiotic that inhibits the formation of N-acetyl-glucosamine-lipid intermediates which serve as donors for the synthesis of the oligosaccharide side chains of glycoproteins (Tkacz and Lampen, 1975) . Kilbourne (1959) and Kaluza et al. (1972) were among the first investigators to utilize inhibitors of glycosylation to study the role of carbohydrates in influenza virions. They showed that 2-dG and D-glucosamine inhibited the biosynthesis of active HA, NA, and mature infectious influenza virions. Subsequent biochemical studies revealed that high concentrations of 2-dG or Dglucosamine prevented the synthesis of influenza virus glycoproteins (Klenk et al., 1972b Nakamura and Compans, 1978a) . Instead, an unglycosylated or incompletely glycosylated hemagglutinin precursor HA,, was detected. Once synthesized, HAo was found associated with cytoplasmic membranes, as is the case with the normal glycoprotein. HAo glycoprotein in cells infected with the fowl plague strain (FPV) was cleaved by cellular proteases to yield a heterogeneous product . However, the comparable protein synthesized in cells infected with the WSN strain was processed and incorporated into virions (Nakamura and Compans, 1978a) .",

Therefore TM, a compound that seems to affect only the glycosylation of glycoproteins, has been employed to extend these studies. T M inhibited virion formation in FPVinfected cells and the unglycosylated glycoprotein HA,, appeared to be degraded by cellular proteases (R. T. ; HA,, of the WSN strain synthesized in the presence of TM also appeared to be completely unglycosylated, whereas even at high concentrations of 2-dG and Dglucosamine some glycosylation occurred (Nakamura and Compans, 1978a) . Nonetheless, TM did not inhibit virion formation to the same extent as 2-dG (Nakamura and Compans, 1978) . The surface spike layer of WSN virions produced in the presence of 2-dG, D-glucosamine, and TM was altered morphologically, and the hemagglutinating activity of the virions was significantly reduced. These results suggest that glycosylation of virion glycoproteins is not required for influenza virion formation but is needed for biological activity of viral glycoproteins. These glycosylation inhibitors have also been used with several other enveloped viruses. When herpes viruses are grown in the presence of 2-dG, the infectious virus yield is decreased by greater than 95%, but the yield of viral particles is not reduced (Courtney et al., 1973) . The reduction in infectivity was attributed to an inability of the virions to attach to the host cell and penetrate, implying that oligosac-charide residues of herpes virus glycoproteins play a role in the attachment and recognition of host cell receptors.",

Hence comparative studies of the effects of viral proteins of the lipid bilayer structure have been made using the techniques of electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and fluorescence polarization (FP). ESR studies have provided evidence that the lipids of influenza virus, SV5, Rauscher leukemia virus, VSV, and SFV (Landsberger et uZ., 1971 (Landsberger et uZ., , 1972 (Landsberger et uZ., , 1973 ; Sefton and Gaffney, 1974) are bilayer structures with fluid lipid phases similar to those observed for other biological membranes, but all viral membranes were shown to be substantially more rigid than the corresponding host cell plasma membrane. Proteolytic removal of the glycoprotein spikes from the surface of SV5 and influenza virions did not appreciably alter the fluidity of the lipid bilayer of these viruses. Lenard et al. (1976) have provided further evidence that the glycoproteins of the influenza virion contribute little to the rigidity of the lipid bilayer. The phospholipid composition of standard influenza particles, and \"incomplete\" virus produced upon serial undiluted passage, were compared and found to be indistinguishable, as were the ESR spectra of the two types of particles. The incomplete particles were shown to contain approximately twice the amount of glycoproteins relative to the complete particles. Thus it was concluded that the rigidity of viral membranes may be determined b y the M protein and not by the viral glycoproteins. This may not be entirely the case for VSV and SFV, since Sefton and Gaffney (1974) and Landsberger and Compans (1976) observed that, when the glycoproteins of these viruses were removed by proteases, the envelope became more fluid, indicating that the viral glycoproteins may contribute to the rigidity of the envelope. However, Landsberger and Compans (1976) postulated that the major effect on VSV bilayer fluidity was exerted by the M protein, since the fluidity of the lipid bilayer was altered only slightly when the G protein was removed by protease, whereas vesicles prepared from extracted viral lipids were much more fluid than lipids in virions.",

The increased microviscosity was attributed in part to insertion of the hydrophobic regions of the glycoproteins into the envelope bilayer. Stoffel and Bister (1975) , using NMR spectra of '3C-labeled lipids, also demonstrated that the envelope lipids of VSV are highly rigid, as a result of either lipid-lipid or lipid-protein interactions. In general it may be concluded therefore that the lipid bilayer of enveloped virions is more rigid than the host cell membrane from which the virion buds. While virion glycoproteins do interact with the lipid bilayer and may affect the rigidity of the membrane to some extent, the internal membrane protein(s) may also be of equal or greater importance in determining membrane rigidity.",

Bunyaviruses (Murphy et aZ., 1973) and coronaviruses (Oshiro, 1973) appear to form primarily by budding into cytoplasmic cisternae, and extracellular virions are observed associated with the plasma membrane. For the rhabdovirus group, several modes of maturation have been reported. VSV, the most widely studied member, usually forms by budding at the cell surface, but maturation at intracellular membranes has been observed. The New Jersey strain of VSV was observed to bud primarily from plasma membranes of L or Vero cells, and almost entirely at intracytoplasmic membranes of pig kidney cells (Zee et al., 1970) .",

Similar conclusions have been made for several virus types. Viral glycoproteins appear to be synthesized on membrane-bound polyribosomes and remain associated with various cellular membranes (Spear and Roizman, 1970; Compans, 1973a,b; Stanley et al., 1973; Klenket al., 1974; David, 1973; Hay, 1974; Atkinsonet al., 1976; Nagai et al., 1976 ; Knipe et al., 1977) . Glycosylation occurs in association with cytoplasmic membranes. Glycoproteins appear to migrate from rough endoplasmic reticulum to smooth or Golgi complex membranes to the cell surface and are then incorporated into virions; at no time are they found as ''soluble'' cytoplasmic components. This general scheme for the synthesis and migration of proteins through intracellular membranes to the cell surface has been termed membrane flow. Although the precise intracellular location of viral glycoproteins remains to be established, a scheme may be envisaged in which these components remain associated with the cisternal side of membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex after synthesis. Incorporation into the plasma membrane by a process of vesicle fusion would then result in the correct orientation on the cell surface for viral as-sembly. A similar scheme has been suggested for the incorporation of glycoproteins into the plasma membrane, based on the distribution of oligosaccharides in different membrane fractions (Hirano et al., 1972) . Viral systems allowed investigators to follow the intracellular migration and glycosylation of specific glycoprotein species for the first time, whereas previous studies with cellular glycoproteins Kad dealt with cell fractions essentially uncharacterized as to the specific proteins present.",

(1977) have shown that the mRNA for VSV G-protein translated in vitro by wheat germ extracts in the presence of dog pancreas rough endoplasmic reticulum is associated with the membrane. Furthermore, the newly synthesized G protein was shown to span the membrane with the amino-terminal asymmetrically located. In addition, the polypeptide portion which penetrated the membrane was shown to be glycosylated. Glycosylation did not occur in the absence of membranes. These studies were extended by Rothman and Lodish (1977) , who showed that the insertion of G-protein into the membrane begins when 80 or fewer amino acid residues are polymerized. Evidence was also obtained that the nascent chain is glycosylated while still attached to the ribosomes on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum vesicle. Since the mechanism by which viral glycoproteins are inserted into membranes is in all probability similar to that of the insertion of host cell glycoproteins, further studies using viral systems may provide more insight into the mechanism of insertion of glycoproteins into membranes.",

After they are inserted into the plasma membrane, initial random distribution may occur in which the proteins are free to undergo lateral diffusion in the plane of the membrane. Such random distribution is illustrated for the glycoproteins of parainfluenza virus in Fig. 3 , and similar observations have been reported for other viruses (Birdwell and Strauss, 1974; H.

The association of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with such regions of modified membrane is followed by budding and release of the completed virion. In the case of influenza virus, the M protein may form a domain on the internal surface of the plasma membrane, stabilized by proteinprotein interactions. Specific recognition of the M protein by the glycoproteins could then produce an accumulation of glycoproteins in a circumscribed region of the cell surface. Alternatively, it is possible that M protein monomers associate with glycoprotein monomers at the plasma membrane, and that these complexes undergo lateral diffusion and aggregation into domains. In either case the lack of host cell membrane proteins in the viral envelope indicates that cellular proteins are efficiently excluded from the region of the plasma membrane which becomes the viral envelope.",

In all cases it is likely that protein-protein interaction serves to create a patch of virus-specific proteins in a cellular membrane, but this interaction may occur on the external or internal surface of the lipid bilayer. As discussed above, for viruses that contain M proteins or welldefined icosahedral nucleocapsids, some evidence has been obtained for the initial random distribution of glycoproteins on the cell surface, which may be followed by lateral diffusion and accumulation of glycoproteins in juxtaposition to the M protein or icosahedral nucleocapsid, with transmembrane interactions between the external and internal proteins serving to anchor the viral glycoproteins in place.

Similar interactions may be important in other virus groups in which glycoproteins are major protein constituents of the virion and there is no known internal membrane protein, such as B-type oncomaviruses and coronaviruses.",

These viruses thus provide an unusual system for investigation of the molecular interactions involved in the formation of a highly organized structure within the cytoplasmic matrix (Dales and Mosbach, 1968 ). However, these viruses are structurally very complex, and limited information has been obtained on their molecular organization. Shape and size determination may also be controlled by viral proteins at various levels; nucleocapsids, M proteins, or glycoproteins could be the determining factor for different virus groups. The phenomenon of phenotypic mixing of envelope glycoproteins in cells doubly infected with VSV and the parainfluenza virus SV5 clearly demonstrates that the internal proteins and not the glycoproteins determine the particle size and shape of rhabdoviruses McSharry et al., 1971 ). This conclusion is supported by the observation that particles with the internal proteins of VSV possess the characteristic bullet shape of VSV while containing mixtures of envelope glycoproteins derived from VSV and SV5. A similar analysis of phenotypically mixed particles produced by dual infections with viruses of other major groups may provide further insights into the macromolecular interactions involved in virion assembly.",
