L. infantum). Biomarkers in the canine immune system is an important technique in the course of developing vaccines and treatment strategies against CVL. New methodologies for studying the immune response of dogs during Leishmania infection and after receiving vaccines and treatments against CVL would be useful. In this context, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy dogs to evaluate procedures related to (i) establishment of in vitro conditions of monocytes differentiated into macrophages infected with L. chagasi and (ii) purification procedures of T-cell subsets (CD4 + and CD8 + ) using microbeads. Our data demonstrated that after 5 days of differentiation, macrophages were able to induce significant phagocytic and microbicidal activity after L. chagasi infection and also showed increased frequency of parasitism and a higher parasite load.

We concluded that monocytes differentiated into macrophages at 5 days and displayed an intermediate frequency of parasitism and parasite load 72 h after L. chagasi infection. Furthermore, the purification system using canine T-lymphocyte subsets obtained after 5 days of monocyte differentiation proved efficient for CD4 or CD8 T-cell purification (\u226590%). The in vitro analysis using L. chagasiinfected macrophages and purified T cells presented a prospective methodology that could be incorporated in CVL vaccine and treatment studies that aim to analyze the microbicidal potential induced by specific CD4 + and/or CD8 + T cells.",

However, the mechanisms by which macrophages kill Leishmania in dogs have not been investigated as thoroughly (Rodrigues et al., 2007) . The immune response against Leishmania sp. is highly dependent on the microbicidal action of macrophages, which are actually the host cell target of this protozoan; however, they have full capacity for antigen presentation and establishment of an effective response against the parasite (Pinelli et al., 1999) .",

However, there is so far no standardized methodology for this purpose, and these tests usually only involve a system with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without purified T-lymphocyte subsets (Holzmuller et al., 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2007 Rodrigues et al., , 2009 . The development of additional methodologies for evaluating the immune system in veterinary medicine, especially in experimental dog models, is required. Such an advance would contribute to the identification of biomarkers related to interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses of dogs. In this context, we aimed to further analyze the immune response by using standardized methodologies for a coculture system of canine L. chagasi-infected macrophages and for obtaining purified CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. This approach could contribute to identifying specific immune response biomarkers for developing a resistance or susceptibility profile in CVL, which could be used in both vaccine and treatment strategies against the parasite.",

As shown in Fig. 6A , Ficoll gradient 1.077 was used to demonstrate a lower percentage of monocytes (10.2%) compared with the results from Ficoll gradients 1119 and 1077 (17.4%, Fig. 6B ).

The percentage of lymphocyte purity using anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies and the sorting using magnetic column demonstrated high levels for CD4 Fig. 6 . Procedures illustrating the PBMCs obtained from distinct strategies based on Ficoll density gradients (A-D) used to establish the purity percentage of T-cells CD4 + (E) and CD8 + (F).

These cells were previously reported in canine macrophages in the 1970s, in the studies of Ho and Babiuk (1979) , however, the cell fusion occurred only in cultures after 4 weeks. In addition, they proposed a virtually pure culture, after 10 days of culture, from which macrophages can be maintained for up to 2 months under in vitro conditions. However, it is noteworthy that the longer the duration of culture, the greater the chances of contamination by different microorganisms. Therefore, it would be helpful to standardize these cultures so that experiments could be performed more quickly. In this context, Goto-Koshino et al.

In this study after 10 days of culture, it was possible to obtain 84.17% canine macrophages. Furthermore, the rates of L. chagasi-infected macrophages after 24 and 72 h of infection were 75.93% and 76.70%, respectively. These results were similar to those of Panaro et al. (1998) . However, except for the results 24 h after internalization of L. chagasi observed in the current study (Fig. 3 , infection rate of 74.1%), the results obtained 72 h after infection by Bueno et al. (2005) are not in accordance with the present study. We found a gradual reduction in the frequency of parasitism and parasite load (number of amastigotes/M ) based on the time after L. chagasi infection, especially for monocytes with a longer period of cell differentiation (5 days). Thus, it became evident that monocytes differentiated after 5 days into macrophages showed greater microbicidal ability, probably due to their stage of maturation.",

However, with the exception of macrophages of 4 days of differentiation, in which enzyme levels were significantly reduced at 72 h post-infection (p < 0.05), the enzyme levels were similar at other times. These results are consistent with those obtained by Kausalya et al. (1996) who found the release pattern of NAG from peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c was similar, with a peak release only after 21 days post L. donovani infection. Moreover, in the study by Chakraborty and Das (1989) , infection with L. donovani peritoneal macrophages from hamsters resulted in a drastic reduction in the levels of NAG during the 96 h following infection. Furthermore, the analysis of NAG levels has not been reproduced with increased dead parasites in the cell culture medium, indicating that inhibition of enzyme levels is related to the characteristics of living parasites (Chakraborty and Das, 1989) . The higher microbicidal activity is closely related to the number of activated macrophages, hence with high levels of secretion of lysosomal hydrolases (Akporiaye et al., 1983) . Moreover, Meagher et al. (1992) described a apoptotic neutrophils study used in addition to macrophages were not sufficient to induce high levels of NAG compared to zymosan. These data indicate that apoptotic neutrophils in the cultures at 5 days may not interfere with the secretion of the lysosomal enzyme due to the phagocytic activity of macrophages.",

Additionally, the results related to morphologic analysis, phagocytosis, microbicidal activity, enzymatic NAG and MPO activity, and the previous reports in the literature confirm that the ideal culture condition of canine monocyte differentiation into macrophages is obtained after 5 days of in vitro monocyte incubation. The canine immune system has several peculiarities, especially in relation to the number of circulating granulocytes in the blood stream. Neutrophils present high expression of the CD4 + molecule (Williams, 1997) , and this feature interferes with the purification of CD4 + T cells with high purity using typical methods of separation. Thus, using peripheral blood samples and performing CD4 + T-cell separation, increased contamination by canine neutrophils cannot be avoided. The best alternative for establishing a purification system was to carry it out on the fifth day of monocyte differentiation, when lower levels of granulocytes are present. This strategy allowed an increased performance of CD4 + or CD8 + purity level (\u226590%) using magnetic column methodology (Fig. 6) .",

At this time, the inclusion of purified CD4 and/or CD8 T cells in infected macrophages culture would be useful for analyzing the impact of modulation in in vitro parasitism. Furthermore, the purification system using canine T-lymphocyte subsets after 5 days of monocyte differentiation proved to be efficient for obtaining cultures permitting high CD4 or CD8 T-cell purity (\u226590%). Thus, the use of co-culture systems employing canine monocytes differentiated into macrophages and purified CD4 + and/or CD8 + T cells may contribute to the analysis of the adaptive immune response in dogs.
