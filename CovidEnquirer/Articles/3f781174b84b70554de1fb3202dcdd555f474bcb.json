            "text": "To determine whether transcriptional levels of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) genes are differentially regulated between a first infection with Aeromonas hydrophila and a re-infection, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed in this study using anterior kidney cDNA after the reinfection as tester. Of the 96 clones isolated from the SSH library, 28 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained, of which eight were confirmed to be slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) more upregulated by the re-infection at 6 h post infection (hpi). Expression kinetics studies at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi revealed that the eight ESTs were significantly (P \u00bc 0.016) more up-regulated by the first infection, with a major peak at 3 hpi. A total of 96 genes reported in literature to be up-regulated by bacterial infections were selected and subjected to expression analysis at 3 hpi. Of the 96 selected genes, 19 were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) induced by A. hydrophila after the first infection and the re-infection. The 19 genes belonged to the following five main categories: 1) toll-like receptor (TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR21); 2) antimicrobial peptide (NK-lysin type 1, NK-lysin type 2, NK-lysin type 3, cathepsin D, transferrin, hepcidin); 3) cytokine or chemokine (interleukin-1b, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor a, chemokine CXCL-10); 4) signaling proteins (cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, very large inducible GTPase 1, arginine deiminase type 2, lymphokine-activated killer T-cell originated protein kinase); 5) lysozyme (lysozyme c). Overall, the total 27 genes (8 ESTs plus the 19 selected genes) were significantly (P < 0.001) more induced by the first infection. Peaked expression of lysozyme c and serum lysozyme activity after the first infection were seen at 24 hpi, whereas that after the re-infection were seen at 12 hpi, suggesting that both innate and adaptive immunity were involved in the defense against the re-infection of A. hydrophila.",

Many fish species can be affected by MAS, including tilapia [5, 6] , catfish [7, 8] , goldfish [9, 10] , common carp [11, 12] , and eel [13] . As an opportunistic pathogen, A. hydrophila caused outbreaks in fish farms with high mortality rates [14e16] . In West Alabama, MAS disease outbreak caused by A. hydrophila in 2009 alone has led to an estimated loss of more than 3 million pounds of food size channel catfish [17] .

Immunity of fish to bacterial infections is largely mediated by cellular immune responses with humoral antibodies having a secondary role [20, 21] . It was reported that live attenuated A. hydrophila induced the upregulation of multiple immune genes in channel catfish [22] . In addition, infection with A. hydrophila induced peak up-regulation of several genes at 6 h post injection (hpi) [22] . However, it was unknown whether gene expression levels in channel catfish after re-infection with A. hydrophila were induced higher compared to that by the first infection. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: 1) identify up-regulated genes in channel catfish after a second infection of A. hydrophila compared to a single infection at 6 hpi by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH); 2) compare the gene expression patterns of at different time (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi) after the first infection and the re-infection to determine the peak response time; and 3) screen genes that were reported in literature and identify genes up-regulated by the first infection and the re-infection at the peak response time.",

Two-step subtractive hybridizations were performed according to procedures described previously [22] . Briefly, two primary hybridization reactions (A and B) were formed by adding excess amounts of first infection cDNA (driver) to second infection cDNA (tester) samples at a 50:1 ratio. The samples were denatured for 2 min at 98 C and allowed to anneal for 8 h at 68 C. The remaining single-stranded, adaptor-ligated tester cDNAs were substantially enriched in each hybridization reaction for overexpressed sequences because non-target cDNAs present in the tester and driver could form hybrids. After filling in the adapter ends with DNA polymerase, over-expressed sequences (tester cDNA) had different annealing sites on their 3 0 -and 5 0 -ends. The molecules were then subjected to suppression subtraction PCR. The PCR products were then cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI).

Quantitative PCR (QPCR) was performed using Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For each cDNA sample, channel catfish 18S ribosomal RNA primers were included as an internal control to normalize the variation in cDNA amount as published previously [22] . All QPCR was performed using Platinum \u00d2 SYBR \u00d2 Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 12.5 ml. The QPCR mixture consisted of 1 ml of cDNA (input RNA of 10 ng), 0.5 ml of 5 mM gene-specific forward primer, 0.5 ml of 5 mM gene-specific reverse primer and 10.5 ml of 1 \u00c2 SYBR Green SuperMix. The QPCR thermal cycling parameters were 50 C for 2 min, 95 C for 10 min followed by 40 cycle of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 1 min. All QPCR was run in duplicate for each pooled cDNA sample (10 kidney samples per pool; three pools were analyzed). The fluorescence intensities of the control and treatment products for each gene, as measured by cycle threshold (C t ) values, were compared and converted to fold differences by the relative quantification method [23] using the Relative Expression Software Tool 384 v. 1 (REST) and assuming 100% efficiencies. Expression differences between control and treatment groups were assessed for statistical significance using a randomization test in the REST software. The mRNA expression levels of all samples were normalized to the levels of 18S ribosomal RNA gene in the same sample. Expression levels of 18S were constant between all samples (<0.30 change in C t ). Each primer set amplified a single product as indicated by a single peak present for each gene during melting curve analysis. The relative transcriptional levels of different genes were determined by subtracting the cycle threshold (C t ) of the sample by that of the 18S rRNA, the calibrator or internal control, as per the formula: DC t \u00bc C t (sample) \u00c0 C t (calibrator). The relative expression level of a specific gene at different time points were compared to that of fish at time 0 using formula 2 \u00c0DDCt where DDC t \u00bc DC t (time point x) \u00c0 DC t (time point 0) as described previously [22] .",

Of the eight ESTs, two Xba elements (XbaI element 5 and XbaI element 7) were up-regulated greater than 6-fold by the second infection. In channel catfish, Xba elements were A/T-rich tandem repetitive non-coding sequences [31] . Non-coding RNA sequences play important roles in regulating transcription of protein-coding genes [32] , including immunity-related genes [33] . Transcriptome analysis of the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection across four founder mouse strains has revealed differential expression of 500 ncRNAs during infection [34] , indicating that differential expression of ncRNAs is widespread in response to infection. Taken together, these results suggest that the overexpression of ncRNAs such as XbaI elements might play important roles in immunity.",

Therefore, 3 hpi was chosen to screen the 96 selected genes. Of the 96 genes selected from literature, 19 were found to be significantly induced by A. hydrophila at 3 hpi compared to that by TSB, regardless the infection time (first infection or second infection). The fact that SSH failed to identify these genes could be due to the following reasons. Firstly, we used cDNAs from the second infection as tester in an attempt to identify genes that are more up-regulated in adaptive response, which might have contributed to the failed discovery of other genes. Secondary, we chose 6 hpi instead of 3 hpi as the time point for SSH which might have contributed to the failed discovery of the known immunity-related genes identified by the screen. Nonetheless, SSH identified differentially expressed genes that were previously reported to be up-regulated by bacteria infections, including TLR20 and NADH dehydrogenase, both of which were reported to be upregulated in channel catfish by Edwardsiella icatluri infection [24, 26] . In addition, SSH also identified genes that were previously not reported to be induced by infection in channel catfish, such as XbaI elements, prolactin, and inward rectifier potassium channel. Prolactin, a peptide hormone that shares many properties with cytokines [35] , plays an important role in immunity by inducing the expression of the genes encoding the major phagocyte NADPH oxidase components and ROS production in fish macrophages via the JAK2/Stat/IRF-1 signaling pathway [36, 37] . Macrophages have two types of potassium channels: inwardly rectifying potassium channel and voltage-gated potassium channel [38, 39] . Potassium channel activity is required for the induction of nitric oxide and respiratory burst response in activated macrophages in goldfish (Carassius auratus) [40] .",

However, TLR5 exhibited similar expression patterns after the first and the second infections, with significant peaked up-regulation at 3 hpi. TLRs are evolutionarily conserved receptors that function in innate immunity through recognition of the conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of an invading pathogen and eliciting inflammatory and immune responses [41] . The best characterized ligand that TLRs recognize include: (1) lipoproteins by TLR2; (2) dsRNA by TLR3; (3) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLR4; and (4) bacterial flagellins by TLR5 [42] . The recognition of PAMPs by TLRs will trigger an intracellular signaling cascade which activates signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, interferons (IFNs), and costimulatory molecules that aid in the development of the immune response [43] . In addition to significant up-regulation of TLR5 at 3 hpi, four signaling proteins were also found to be significantly up-regulated at 3 hpi after the first infection or the second infection, including cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, very large inducible GTPase 1, arginine deiminase, and lymphokine-activated killer T-cell originated protein kinase. At 3 hpi, the expression of the four cytokine or chemokine also peaked, although the expression of IL-1b and chemokine CXCL-10 after the first infection were the highest.",

At 24 hpi, the expression levels of XbaI element 5 and XbaI element 7 were the highest. At 48 hpi, transferrin had the highest expression. IL-1b is an important early response pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates immune regulation in both innate and adaptive immunity [44] . When IL-1b was over-expressed in common carp (Cyprinus carpio), the macrophage functions such as production of superoxide anion and phagocytosis were significantly stimulated [45] . IL-10 is reported to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation by down-regulating expression of other cytokines such as IL-1b [46] . In consistent with previous report, we also observed the lowest expression level (<10 fold) of IL-1b at 12 hpi when IL-10 was expressed the highest (w60 fold). Significant up-regulation of hepcidin and transferrin has been reported in channel catfish after infection with E. ictaluri or A. hydrophila [22, 30] . In consistent with previous reports, this study also revealed that hepcidin and transferrin were induced by infection with A. hydrophila.
