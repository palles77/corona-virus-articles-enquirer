Particularly, CD and NMR studies indicate that unlike Dengue, the C-terminal region of Zika NS2B with a significant sequence variation is highly disordered in the open conformation. Indeed, MD simulations reveal that up to 100 ns, the Dengue NS2B C-terminus constantly has close contacts with its NS3pro domain. By a sharp contrast, the Zika NS2B C-terminus loses the contacts with its NS3pro domain after 10 ns, further forming a short \u03b2-sheet characteristic of the closed conformation at 30 ns. Furthermore, we found that a small molecule, previously identified as an active site inhibitor for other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro, inhibited Zika NS2B-NS3pro potently in an allosteric manner. Our study provides the first insight into the dynamics of Zika NS2B-NS3pro and further deciphers that it is susceptible to allosteric inhibition, which thus bears critical implications for the future development of therapeutic allosteric inhibitors.",

From synthetic genes with E. coli preferred codons, we amplified and subsequently cloned the DNA fragments into His-tagged expression vectors, which encode the isolated NS2B (48-100) with the transmembrane regions deleted (Fig. 1A) ; as well as isolated NS3 (14-185) (Fig. 1B) . The expression level of the recombinant NS2B was extremely low, and consequently we needed to grow many liters of E. coli cells to obtain sufficient NS2B for refolding with NS3pro by the same protocol we previously utilized for the Dengue one (12) . The refolded NS2B-NS3pro with His-tag (column 2 of Fig. 1C ) was cleaved by thrombin covalently linked to beads to remove the His-tag, followed by binding to an excess amount of the Ni 2+ -beads to remove His-tag and uncleaved fusion protein, as well as final purification with FPLC gel-filtration chromatography to obtain unlinked NS2B-NS3pro without His-tag (column 3 of Fig. 1C ). We attempted to refold Zika NS3pro without NS2B and found that NS3pro completely precipitated during refolding, thus indicating that Zika NS3pro also absolutely requests its NS2B cofactor for the correct folding, as previously observed on other flavivirus NS3 proteases (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

Both spectra have similar up-field peaks manifested, suggesting that both of them are folded (12, 20, 23, 24) . However, it is interesting to note that the peaks of the linked complex are much more broad than those of the unlinked, implying that the linkage may introduce \u00b5s-ms conformational dynamics, as previously observed on the linked Dengue NS2B-NS3pro (12, 20, 23) . Indeed, we attempted to acquire 1 H-15 N NMR HSQC spectrum of the linked protease, but failed to detect any peaks due to significant peak broadening. By contrast, despite having almost the same sequences, 15 N-labeled Zika NS3pro in the unlinked complex has a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum, indicating that the NS3pro is well-folded, although many HSQC peaks were still too broad to be detectable (Fig. 2B ).",

This suggests that in Zika NS2B-NS3pro, all 4 Trp residues are similarly buried as Dengue ones, as Trp residue in the unfolded proteins has an emission maximum wavelength > 352 nm (24) . Strikingly, however, both linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes have far-UV CD spectra with the maximal negative signal at the wavelength of ~201 nm and is lacking of any positive signal below 200 nm, which is very different from that of unlinked Dengue one of the same length (12) , which has the maximal negative signal at 217 nm and large positive signal at 192 nm ( Fig.   2E ). This strongly suggests that Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes contain much more disordered regions than the Dengue, completely consistent with the NMR HSQC result of the 15 N-labeled NS2B (Fig. 2C) . Unfortunately, the low solubility and \u00b5s-ms conformational dynamics prevented us from conducting NMR assignments of Zika NS2B-NS3pro by triple-resonance NMR experiments.",

We also measured the proteolytic activities of our linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes in the same buffer as previously published (17) . Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3C , the Zika NS2B-NS3pro efficiently cleaved Bz-nKRR-AMC, but unexpectedly showed very weak activity on other two. This implies that in addition to requesting dibasic residues at the P1 and P2 sites characteristic of the flaviviral NS3 proteases, Zika NS2B-NS3pro appears to have the higher request of a basic residue at P3 site than the Dengue complexes (17) . However, as our current focus was not on profiling substrate specificity, in the present study, we did not test on more substrates but measured kinetic constants of linked and unlinked Zika complexes on Bz-nKRR-AMC.",

Later, this molecule has been extensively demonstrated to bind Dengue (Table 1 ). Most strikingly, as clearly evidenced from Lineweaver-Burk plots for both linked (Fig. 3E ) and unlinked (Fig. 3G ) Zika complexes, the small molecule acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for both forms. We have searched all literatures citing the original paper (19) , but only found IC50 value of this inhibitor on West Nile NS2B-NS3pro complex (34.2 \u00b5M) in the original paper (19) .

By a sharp contrast, the Zika residues Pro93-Met94-Arg95 corresponding to Dengue Gln93-Thr94-Leu95 lose the contact with NS3pro after 10 ns and consequently the Zika NS2B C-region becomes highly exposed (Fig. 4F ).

However, its NMR peaks are much more broad even than those of linked NS2B-NS3pro ( Fig. 2A) , most likely due to \u00b5s-ms conformational dynamics or/and dynamic aggregation. On the other hand, its intrinsic UV fluorescence spectrum indicates that its four Trp residues are similarly buried as linked and unlinked Zika complexes with the fulllength NS2B (Fig. 2D ). Most interestingly, as judged from its CD spectrum which has the maximal negative signal shifted to 207 nm and has positive signal at 191 nm (Fig. 2E) , this author/funder. All rights reserved.

This is completely consistent with NMR HSQC spectrum of 15 N-labeled Zika NS2B in complex with unlabeled NS3pro (Fig. 2C) , indicating that at least half of the Zika NS2B residues are highly dynamic. This unusually high dynamics appear to result mainly from the large sequence difference over the NS2B C-terminal residues 91-96 between Zika and Dengue (Fig. 5D) . Indeed, a short Zika NS2B with residues 75-100 deleted is sufficient to form a complex with its NS3pro, which has the less disordered structure but is enzymatically inactive, thus not only confirming that the Zika NS2B C-terminal residues is highly disordered, but also supporting the previous proposal that the formation of the closed conformation is essential for the enzymatic catalysis.",

As such, the loss of this contact in Zika NS2B-NS3pro in the open conformation implies that the energy barrier separating the \"open\" and \"closed\" forms of the Zika complex might be lower than that of the Dengue complex (Fig. 6G) .

Most importantly, this molecule acts as an allosteric inhibitor for both Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes, fundamentally different from a recently reported peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor which is a competitive inhibitor (25) . This suggests that Zika NS2B-NS3pro is susceptible to allosteric inhibition. Furthermore, as this allosteric inhibitor also has a structure scaffold very different from the peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes (35) .",

With designed primers, the genes by GenScript were used as templates for amplifying DNA fragments encoding the isolated NS3 (14-185) and NS2B (48-100) with the transmembrane regions removed, as well as NS2B (48-74) with the C-region further deleted. Furthermore, DNA fragments were designed for linking NS2B (48-100) to NS3 (14-185) by (Gly)4-Ser-(Gly)4 using overlap PCR as previously described (14) .

Water molecules using the TIP3P model are used to solvate the MD system. 8 Na + ions were added into the Zika NS2B-NS3pro to make the charge of the respective MD system neutral.

The time step was set as 2 fs. Prior to MD production simulation, two stages of equilibration were done independently for each MD simulation set. First equilibration phase was done in NVT ensemble for 100 ps with the following settings: long-range electrostatic interactions calculated with fast particle-mesh Ewald summation method; a cutoff of 9 \u00c5 for electrostatic interactions and a cutoff of 14 \u00c5 for van der Waals interactions; the temperature was kept constant at 300 K with Berendsen's coupling. Second equilibration phase was done in NPT ensemble for 100 ps with the same settings as the first equilibration phase and some additional settings: pressure coupling was held at 1 bar with Parrinello-Rahma coupling; isothermal compressibility was set at 4.5*10 bar.

Initial fluorescence velocities (relative fluorescence units/sec) were calculated and curves were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression For IC50 determination, the protease at 50 nM was preincubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min with p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate at various concentrations and the reaction was initiated by adding Bz-nKRR-AMC to 250 \u03bcM. For Ki determination, the assay was performed with different final concentrations of the inhibitor and substrate. The protease at 50 nM was incubated with the inhibitor at different concentrations for 30 min at 37 \u00baC. Subsequently, the reaction was initiated by addition of the corresponding concentration series of the substrate as described. The Ki was obtained by fitting in the non-competitive inhibition mode (36).
