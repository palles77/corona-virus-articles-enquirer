            "text": "A murine model to study enteritis induced by bovine (BRV) and murine rotavirus (MRV) has been developed. The course of infection was determined by clinical symptoms of diarrhea and virus isolation as well as histopathological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic methods. Both isolates were able to replicate and produce clinical symptoms in neonatal mice. Rotavirus-free neonates were orally inoculated with MRV or BRV and observed over a 192-hr postinoculation (HPI) period. Following infection with lo4 PFU of virus, diarrhea and maximal intestinal dysfunction, as measured by xylose absorption, did not occur until beyond 20 hr postinfection even though maximal virus production occurred at 10-15 HPI. Immunohistochemically and by electron microscopy we were able to demonstrate viral antigen and virus particles in the enterocytes of villous tips at 5-8 HPI. The appearance of diarrhea1 symptoms was dependent on the virus dose and the type of virus isolate inoculated. The disease could be induced with doses as low as 1 X 10' PFUimouse of BRV and 1 x 10' PFU/mouse of MRV. On the basis of these results, MRV was found to be more virulent than BRV in this model. The model should prove useful for studies designed to assess rotavirus virulence genes and for vaccine protection studies. This work emphasizes the need for early sample collection for critical evaluation of any vaccine or antiviral agent using this model. 0 1989 Academic Press. II-S. 186",

            "text": "Since the discovery of rotavirus in feces of calves suffering from diarrhea (Mebus et al., 1969) it has been reported that rotaviruses are ubiquitous animal and human pathogens that cause significant diarrhea1 diseases in most mammalian and avian species (reviewed in Babiuk, 1984; Babiuk et al., 1985; Flewett and Babiuk, 1984) . Rotaviruses constitute a genus of the family Reoviridae and infectious viral particles are characterized by a 70-nm-sized double-shelled capsid surrounding an icosahedral core that contains 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. They have been associated with enteritis of young animals (under 1 month) and infants (6 months to 2 years) (Flewett and Babiuk, 1984) . It has been estimated that over 500 x lo6 cases of diarrhea occur annually in humans, resulting either directly or indirectly in approximately 10 x lo6 deaths, of which approximately 1 x lo6 have been attributed to rotaviruses (reviewed in Babiuk, 1984) . Although an accurate estimate of numbers of diarrhea1 cases in animals are not available, it is believed to be at least as high as in humans, thus indicating the economic importance of this disease. It has been estimated that approximately 5% of the calves born in North America die from diarrhea before they reach 1 month of age. On the basis of these findings it has been estimated that losses in the United States average $250 million and on a world wide basis, $1-7 billion annually (reviewed in Ratafia, 1987) . The significant role played by these viruses in acute neonatal enteritis has created a world-wide impetus to develop an appropriate vaccine (Both and Jennings, 1987; Chanock et al., 1988; Jordan, 1988; Ratatia, 1987) . No such vaccine is yet available. In order to develop effective methods of prevention and control, efforts have been directed at developing animal models for rotavirus-induced diarrhea which would mimic human (6 months to 2 years) (Conner et al., 1988) and animal (< 1 month) (Eiden et al., 1986; Eydelloth et al., 1984; Gouvea et al., 1986; Otfit et al., 1984; Offor et al., 1985; Ramig, 1988; Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 1982; Starkey et al., 1986; Wolf et al., 1981) situations. In order to test rotavirus vaccines developed in our laboratory we have developed a murine model for murine rotavirus (MRV) and bovine rotavirus (BRV) infections, in which rotavirusinduced diarrhea can be produced in the first week of the neonate's life, thus mimicking the time when disease is prevalent in natural cases. These studies were conducted to determine the effect of virus dose on the induction of clinical disease (diarrhea) and the kinetics of virus replication in the murine intestinal tract. This model should prove useful in studies aimed at identifying rotavirus genes (Off3 et al., 1986) involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and expression of immunogenicity of the virus.",

Both virus isolates were propagated in confluent African green monkey kidney cells (MA-104) in 1 pg of trypsin (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) per milliliter, in the absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO Laboratories, Grand Island, NY).

BRV and MRV grown in MA-104 cells and harvested were clarified by centrifugation at 1OOOg for 20 min.

First it has been demonstrated (Reipenhoff-Talty et al., 1982) that maximum receptors for rotaviruses are present at 7 to 11 days of age. Second, 7-day-old mice are easier to handle than l-day-old mice. Third, one of our goals is to investigate the potential of lactogenic immunity to protect mice from diarrhea. Results of previous experiments (Ijaz et al., 1987b) revealed that the highest titer of anti-rotavirus neutralizing antibodies is present at 7 to 9 days reports (Eydelloth et al., 1984; Gouvea et al., 1986; Kraft, 1982; Offrt et al., 191 64; Ramig, 1988; Starkey et al., 1986; Wolf et al., 1981) . However, the peaks of infectious virus occurred earlier than in other studies, suggesting that the rate of replication of both the isolates is much faster than other human and animal ro 'tavirus isolates used in mouse models. Among the two isolates used, MRV has be :en found to be more virulent than BRV in this model, as was evident clinically by the use of the D-xylose absorption test. These differences are consistent our earlier in vitro and in vivo studies comparing these two isolates (Sabara er 1989) . and with ! al., The results of the present study on the infection and replication of both homologous and heterologous rotavirus in a murine model confirm and extend the reports of others (Eydelloth et al., 1984; Gouvea et al., 1986; Kraft, 1982; Offrt et al., 1984; Ramig, 1988; Starkey et al., 1986; Wolf et al., 1981) . However, our results differ from previous reports in several respects. used approximately lo6 PFU/mouse of both heterologous as well as homologous rotavirus to demonstrate the replication and disease symptoms and that lower doses of virus would not produce disease in mice. In our study, we not only demonstrated the replication, but also production of clinical symptoms at doses as low as 10' PFU/mouse (Table I) .",

(4) The biphasic nature of infectious rotavirus or rotavirus antigen production as reported in some studies using mice was not seen in the present study. The drop in infectious rotavirus titer at 20 HP1 could be seen as a result of accelerated virus clearance associated with the start of diarrhea1 symptoms and loss of enterocytes bearing rotavirus specific receptors required for infection to continue. No infectious virus was recovered between 24 and 192 hr postinfection, despite the presence of diarrhea symptoms.

The results revealed that in cattle MRV was also more virulent since it induced more fluid in the intestinal loops than did BRV (Sabara et al., 1989) . The differences in the virulence of BRV and MRV were further confirmed under in vitro conditions (Sabara et al., 1989) . A comparison of the kinetics of the protein synthesis revealed that no BRV proteins were identifiable at 2 HPI, whereas in the case of MRV, several virus-specific proteins were present at this time. These results correlate with our in vitro observations of the cytopathogenic effect (CPE) in MA-104 cells infected with MRV, CPE occurs almost immediately after virus adsorption to the cells, whereas for BRV, CPE was not observed until about 8 hr after adsorption (unpublished data).",

Analysis of BRV and MRV VP4 by carboxypeptidase digestion revealed only one region of heterogeneity between these two viruses in the area spanning amino acids 307 and 407. The difference between BRV and MRV has been further manifested on the basis of their sensitivity to chelating agents (Sabara et al., 1989) . The observed difference in the virulence of these two viruses under in vivo conditions may be a consequence of the observed differences in the outer shell proteins of MRV when compared to BRV. More specifically, the difference in the primary structure of the VP4 (amino acid 307 and 407) may be one of the factors contributing to the increased virulence of MRV.",
