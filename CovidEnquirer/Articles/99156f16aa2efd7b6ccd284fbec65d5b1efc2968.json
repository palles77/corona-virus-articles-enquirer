The chemical modification of lead compounds, on a trial-and-error basis, typically led to compounds with improved potency, selectivity and bioavailability and reduced toxicity. However, this approach is labor-and time-intensive and researchers in the pharmaceutical industry are constantly developing methods with a view to increasing the efficiency of the drug discovery process [1] . Two directions have evolved from these efforts. The 'random' approach involves the development of HTS assays and the testing of a large number of compounds. Combinatorial chemistry is used to satisfy the need for extensive compound libraries. The 'rational', protein structure-based approach relies on an iterative procedure of the initial determination of the structure of the target protein, followed by the prediction of hypothetical ligands for the target protein from molecular modeling and the subsequent chemical synthesis and biological testing of specific compounds (the structure-based drug design cycle).",

Although the protein data bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) is growing rapidly (~13 new entries daily), the 3D structure of only 1-2% of all known proteins has as yet been experimentally characterized. However, advances in sequence comparison, fold recognition and protein-modeling algorithms have enabled the partial closure of the so-called 'sequence-structure gap' and the extension of experimental protein structure information to homologous proteins. The quality of these homology models, and thus their applicability to, for example, drug discovery, predominantly depends on the sequence similarity between the protein of known structure (template) and the protein to be modeled (target). Despite the numerous uncertainties that are associated with homology modeling, recent research has shown that this approach can be used to significant advantage in the identification and validation of drug targets, as well as for the identification and optimization of lead compounds. In this review, we will focus on the application of homology models to the drug discovery process.",

The fold assignment process identifies proteins of known 3D structure (template structures) that are related to the polypeptide sequence of unknown structure (the target sequence; this is not to be mistaken with drug target). Next, a sequence database of proteins with known structures (e.g. the PDB-sequence database) is searched with the target sequence using sequence similarity search algorithms or threading techniques [3] . Following identification of a distinct correlation between the target protein and a protein of known 3D structure, the two protein sequences are aligned to identify the optimum correlation between the residues in the template and target sequences. The next stage in the homology modeling process is the model-building phase. Here, a model of the target protein is constructed from the substitution of amino acids in the 3D structure of the template protein and the insertion and/or deletion of amino acids according to the sequence alignment. Finally, the constructed model is checked with regard to conformational aspects and is corrected or energy minimized using force-field approaches.",

If only significantly different proteins are considered (~7400), which omits muteins, artificial proteins and multiple structure determinations of the same proteins (e.g. HIV-protease and carbonic anhydrase II), then less than 1% of the 3D structures of known protein sequences have been elucidated. This sequence-structure gap can partly be filled with homology models. For example, the queryable database ModBase (http://alto.compbio. ucsf.edu/modbase-cgi/index.cgi) provides access to an enormous number of annotated comparative protein structure models [10] . The program PSI-BLAST was used to assign protein folds to all 1,182,126 unique sequence entries in Swiss-Prot-TrEMBL. For 56% of these sequences, comparative models with an average model size of 235 amino acids could be built using the program MODELLER [11] . Thus, by August 2003, 659,495 3D structure models of proteins were accessible via the Internet. The models are predicted to have at least 30% of their C \u03b1 atoms superimposed within 3.5 \u00c5 of their correct positions. Information on binding sites and ligands can be retrieved from this database using LigBase [8] .

When the sequence identity is between 15% and 30%, conventional alignment methods are not sufficiently reliable and only sophisticated, profile-based methods are capable of recognizing homology and predicting fold. For regions of low sequence identity, threading methods [15] are often applied. Protein models that are built on such low sequence identities can be used for the assignment of protein function and for the direction of mutagenesis experiments ( Figure 2 ). Models that have a sequence identity between ~30% and 50% could facilitate the structure-based prediction of target drugability, the design of mutagenesis experiments and the design of in vitro test assays ( Figure 2 ). If sequence identity is greater than ~50%, the resulting models are frequently of sufficient quality to be used in the prediction of detailed protein-ligand interactions, such as structure-based drug design and prediction of the preferred sites of metabolism of small molecules ( Figure 2 ).",

Based on the total numbers of known genes, disease-modifying genes and drugable proteins, the number of drug target proteins, for humans, has been estimated at 600-1500 [18] . For small molecules, sets of properties have been established that differentiate drugs from other compounds [19, 20] ; these properties can be used to identify compounds with, for example, poor oral absorption properties [21] . Drug molecules and their corresponding target proteins are highly complementary, which suggests that some rules that distinguish good target proteins from others should be deducible [22] . Deep lipophilic pockets that comprise distinct polar interaction sites are clearly superior to shallow highly charged protein surface regions. The inhibition of protein-protein interfaces as a valuable therapeutic principle has recently been shown with inhibitors of the p53-murine double minute clone 2 (MDM2) interaction [23, 24] . The binding site for these inhibitors is a distinct lipophilic pocket that normally interacts with the \u03b1-helical surface patches of the p53 tumor suppressor transactivation domain. Advances in the rapid detection, description and analysis of ligand-binding pockets [25] [26] [27] , together with the availability of more than 0.5 million homology models, will open new possibilities for the prioritization of proteins with regards to drugability. In the pharmaceutical industry, structural aspects are being increasingly implemented as additional decision criteria on the drugability of potential drug targets. Companies such as Inpharmatica (http:// www.inpharmatica.com) have developed an integrated suite of informatics-based discovery technologies that contain software tools for the structure-based assessment of target drugability.",

            "text": "One of the most attractive ways to validate a target protein is to administer a pharmacologically active compound that selectively acts on that protein and to study the effects in a relevant animal model. Similar strategies have been described under the term 'chemogenomics' [30] . It has recently been shown that it is possible to design small molecules based on homology models and then to use these compounds as tools to study the physiological role of the respective target protein of that particular drug [31] . Eight years after the discovery of estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2), the distinct roles of the two ER isotypes, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, in mediating the physiological responses to estrogens are not completely understood. Although knockout animal experiments have provided an insight into estrogen signaling, additional information on the function of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 was imparted by the application of isotype selective ER agonists. Based on the crystal structure of the ER\u03b1ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a homology model of the ER\u03b2-LBD (59% sequence identity to ER\u03b1), Hillisch et al. [31] designed steroidal ligands that exploit the differences in size and flexibility of the two ligand-binding cavities ( Figure 4 ). Compounds that were predicted to bind preferentially to either ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 were synthesized and tested in vitro. This approach led directly to highly ER isotype-selective (200-250-fold) ligands that were also highly potent. To unravel the physiological roles of each of the two receptors, in vivo experiments with rats were conducted using the ER\u03b1-and ER\u03b2-selective agonists in parallel with the natural ligand of ER, 17\u03b2-estradiol. The ER\u03b1 agonist was shown to be responsible for most of the known estrogenic effects (e.g. induction of uterine growth and bone-protection), in addition to pituitary (e.g. reduction of luteinizing hormone plasma levels) and liver (e.g. increase in angiotensin I plasma levels) effects [31] . However, the ER\u03b2 agonist had distinct effects on the ovary, for example, the stimulation of early folliculogenesis [32] , which possibly presents clinicians with a new option for tailoring classical ovarian stimulation protocols. A comparison of the homology model with the X-ray crystal structure of the ER\u03b2-LBD complexed with genistein [33] revealed that the homology model had a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of the backbone atoms (not considering helix 12) of 1.4 \u00c5. The X-ray crystal structure confirmed the presence of essential interactions between the ligand and the ER\u03b2 and did not reveal, at least in this case, any new aspects for the design of ER\u03b2 agonists that were not covered by the homology model. These studies show that it is possible to design highly selective compounds, if structure information on all of the relevant homologs of the target is available, and 663 DDT Vol. 9, No. 15 August 2004 reviews research focus www.drugdiscoverytoday.com Figure 3 .

Comparison of the two models revealed a unique cluster of negatively charged residues in the turret of K v 1.3 that were not present in IK Ca 1. To exploit this difference, the homology model was used to design novel analogs, which were then synthesized and tested. Research demonstrated that the novel compounds blocked IK Ca 1 activity with ~20-fold higher affinity than K v 1.3 [44] . 4. (a,b) Comparison of the two isotypes of the estrogen receptor.

The key proteinase (M pro , or 3CL pro ) of the new coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 (SARS-CoV) is another example of successful homology model building; in this case, success is defined as the ability to use the model to propose an inhibitor that has significant affinity for the target enzyme. X-ray crystal structures for the M pro s of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, a porcine coronavirus) and of human coronavirus 229E [45, 46] have been characterized. These proteinases have 44 and 40% sequence identity, respectively, with the key proteinase of SARS-CoV. Following publication of the genome sequence of the new virus, first on the internet and a few weeks later in print [46, 47] , the level of sequence identity between the proteinases enabled Anand et al. [46] to construct a 3D homology model for the M pro of human CoV. However, the 3D homology model generated was insufficient for the design of inhibitors with reasonable confidence. To establish the structural basis of the interaction with the polypeptide substrate of the M pro , Anand and co-workers [46] synthesized a substrate-analogous hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitor that was complexed with TGEV M pro . The X-ray crystal structure of the complex was then determined, which revealed that, as expected, the chloromethylketone moiety had covalently reacted with the active-site cysteine residue of the proteinase. The P1, P2, and P4 side chains of the inhibitor had bound to, and thereby defined, the specificity binding sites of the target enzyme. The experimentally determined structure of the inhibitor-TGEV M pro complex was then compared with all inhibitor complexes of cysteine proteinases in the PDB, which revealed a surprisingly similar inhibitor binding mode in the complex of human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2) 3C proteinase with AG7088 ( Figure 5 ) [48] . At that time, AG7088 was in late Phase II clinical trials as a drug for the treatment of the strain of the common cold that is caused by human rhinovirus. The comparison of the crystal structures of HRV2 in complex with AG7088 and TGEV M pro in complex with the hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitor revealed little similarity between the two target enzymes, except in the immediate neighborhood of the catalytic cysteine residue, but an almost perfect match of the inhibitors. To investigate these findings further, AG7088 was docked into the substrate-binding site of the SARS-CoV M pro model without much difficulty, although it was noted that there could potentially be steric problems with the p-fluorobenzyl group in the S2 pocket, and also with the ethylester moiety in S1\u2032. Therefore, it was proposed that, although AG7088 was not an ideal inhibitor, this compound should be a good starting point for the design of anti-SARS drugs. Indeed, only a few days after the on-line publication of these results in ScienceXpress [46] , it was confirmed that AG7088 had anti-SARS activity in vitro. Derivatives of AG7088 with modified P2 residues have since been shown to have K i values in the lower \u00b5molar range (Rao et al., pers. commun.) . The crystal structure of the authentic SARS-CoV key proteinase was determined a few months later [49] . Although the dimeric structure showed the expected similarity to the homologous enzymes of TGEV and human CoV 229E, there were interesting differences in detail. In particular, one of the monomers in the dimer was observed to be in an inactive conformation, which was thought to be the result of the low pH of crystallization. The overall rmsd for the entire dimer from the homology model of Anand et al. [46] was >3.0 \u00c5 (i.e. no residues excluded from the comparison), which dropped to 2.1 \u00c5 when a few outliers at the carboxy terminus were excluded from the comparison, and to <1.8 \u00c5 for each of the three individual domains of the enzyme. Other homology models were generated (D. Debe, unpublished and [50] ) and virtual screening has been performed using a SARS-CoV M pro model [51] . Taken together, these findings confirm that homology modeling is often inadequate for the prediction of the mutual orientation of domains in multidomain proteins. However, the homology model generated by Anand et al. [46] also shows that a reasonable model of a substrate-binding site can serve to develop useful ideas for inhibitor design that can inspire medicinal chemists to start a synthesis program long before the 3D structure of the target enzyme is experimentally determined.",

The X-ray crystal structure of only one GPCR, bovine rhodopsin, has been determined [52] . This structure is complemented by bacteriorhodopsin, which is a transmembrane protein that comprises seven helices and is also of relevance for modeling approaches, even though this protein is not a GPCR. Some examples of homology models for GPCRs and their utility have recently been reviewed [53] . High-throughput docking has been applied to verify the ability of homology models to identify agonists (glucocorticoid receptor agonists) [54] , antagonists of retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 [55] , D 3 -dopamine-, M 1 -muscarinic acetylcholine-and V 1a -vasopressin-receptors [56] and inhibitors of thrombin [57] . In the identification of thrombin inhibitors, homology models of thrombin were built retrospectively and were based on homologous serine proteases (28%-40% sequence identity); the best docking solutions were yielded with those models that were derived from proteins of higher sequence identity. Recently, the performance of docking studies into protein active sites that had been constructed from homology models was assessed using experimental screening datasets of CDK2 and factor VIIa [58] . When the sequence identity between the model and the template near the binding site was greater than ~50%, there was an approximate fivefold increase in the number of active compounds identified than would have been be detected randomly. This performance is comparable to docking to crystal structures.",

Many drug discovery projects endeavor to identify ligands that are highly selective for particular drug targets. Selective compounds are supposed to be superior because such compounds typically lead to fewer adverse side effects (e.g. COX-2 inhibitors). However, the most important homologs that should not be targeted by the desired drug, with respect to the actual target, are not always clear, particularly within the larger target protein families. The sequence similarity of the full-length proteins or entire domains might not always be representative of the target protein when considering the conservation of the ligand-binding pockets. Comparison of the shape and features of the binding pockets within a protein family could indicate which homologs should be included in the screening cascade for so-called 'counter screening'. The structure information that is currently available on entire protein families (e.g. proteases, kinases and nuclear receptors) could contribute to the design of selective compounds or better screening cascades, both of which could potentially advance the design of drugs that have fewer side effects.",

The proposal is that animals having target proteins with significantly different binding sites compared with human orthologs should be excluded as pharmacological models. Many promising compounds showing high-potency in human in vitro assays have not reached clinical trials because efficacy could not be demonstrated in animal models. Single amino acid differences between humans and animals might, in some cases, be sufficient to cause such effects. The ER selectivity of ligands described by Hillisch et al. [31] was shown by homology models and in vitro assays to be crucially dependent on the interaction of ligand substituents with one particular amino acid that differs between ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (Figure 4a ) [31] . To ensure that this important interaction is present in estrogen receptors of all animal models that are used to characterize compounds [32] , homology models of murine, rat and bovine ER\u03b2 were built and compared with the binding pocket of human ER\u03b2 (hER\u03b2). A complete conservation of amino acids within the binding pockets of human, murine and rat ER\u03b2 was observed. However, bovine ER\u03b2 showed one amino acid difference at the exact position that was determined to be crucial for ER\u03b2 ligand selectivity. The prediction that the hER\u03b2 selective compounds should not bind to bovine ER\u03b2 was later verified using transactivation experiments (unpublished results). Thus, the implementation of uninterpretable experiments could be avoided at an early stage and the otherwise attractive bovine tissues (later available in larger amounts) could be excluded from ex vivo investigations. Similarly, information on the structure of progesterone receptors (PR) can be used to explain the abolished binding of the progesterone antagonist mifepristone (RU 486) to chicken PR and hamster PR [60] . A single point mutation (human PR Gly722 to chicken PR Cys575) prevents antiprogestins containing 11\u03b2-aryl substituents (e.g. RU 486) from binding to chicken (and hamster) PR (Figure 4c) , which therefore excludes hamsters, for example, from pharmacological studies with antiprogestins [61] . In the future, such effects could be predicted and particular species could then be excluded from pharmacological studies at an early stage, which would ultimately reduce attrition rates in the drug discovery process.",

Only ~10 hepatic CYPs are responsible for the metabolism of 90% of known drugs. Recently, the X-ray crystal structures of three mammalian CYPs, CYP2C5 [62] , CYP2C8 [63] and CYP2C9 [64] , have been solved and represent a solid basis for the homology modeling of this entire superfamily. Models of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4 and CYP4A11 have been generated using different structure templates. These models have been used to explain and to predict the probable sites of metabolic attack in a variety of CYP substrates [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] . However, the large lipophilic and highly flexible character of some CYP binding cavities renders pure in silico approaches towards the prediction of the occurrence and site of small molecule metabolism extremely difficult. If protein structure information is combined with pharmacophoric patterns and quantum mechanical calculations, some predictions concerning the preferred sites of metabolism within small molecules are possible [73] . Regarding this aspect of homology modeling, CYP2D6 is a particularly interesting CYP because 5-9% of the Caucasian population does not produce this polymorphic member of the CYP superfamily. The resulting deficiencies in drug oxidation can lead to severe side effects in these individuals. Predictions on whether or not a lead compound could act as a CYP2D6 substrate could help to identify problematic cases early in drug discovery. Combined homology modeling and quantitative SAR approaches are able to predict such CYP inhibitors [74] . Thus, in the future, protein structure information in conjunction with high-throughput docking and pharmacophore-based methods could be used to decide which compounds have the potential to inhibit particular CYPs. This approach could facilitate the detection of potential drug-drug interactions early in the drug discovery process and measures could then be taken to avoid such interactions [75] .",

In principle, the in silico prediction of drug-metabolizing enzyme induction could be reduced to predicting the binding and activation of transcription factors (e.g. AhR and CAR). However, recent Xray structure analyses of PXR have shown that the LBD of this nuclear receptor contains a large lipophilic and flexible binding pocket [77] . This renders pure in silico structure-based predictions concerning whether or not a small molecule will activate PXR difficult. The homology modeling of CAR [78, 79] and other members of the nuclear receptor family involved in CYP induction [80] have recently been described. These models predict reasonably shaped potential ligand binding pockets. However, further results on the utility of these models are needed.",

Such selective compounds can even be applied to gain insights into the physiological role of novel drug targets. The in silico protein structure-based prediction of metabolism and toxicity of small molecules, particularly CYP inhibition and induction and hERG inhibition, is currently in its infancy and predictive capabilities could be limited to classification only.

Arrows indicate the methods that can be used to detect sequence similarity between target and template sequences. Applications of the homology models in drug discovery are listed to the right. The higher the sequence identity, the more accurate the resulting structure information. Homology models that are built on sequence identities above ~50% can frequently be used for drug design purposes. Superimpositions of X-ray crystal structures of the ligand-binding domains of members of the nuclear receptor family are shown to the left. These X-ray structures illustrate the increase in structure deviation with a decreased sequence identity. The PR is red, the GR is green, the ER\u03b1 is blue and the TR\u03b2 is cyan. Sequence identities: PR:GR, 54%; PR:ER\u03b1, 24%; and PR:TR\u03b2, 15%.
