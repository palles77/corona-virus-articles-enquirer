Micrographs revealed normal intestinal morphology with long, round, tapering villi when milk was fed. Casein feeding produced shorter, broader villi than did feeding whole milk. Abnormalities included absence of villi and short, blunted, convoluted villi on mucosal surfaces of calves fed soy proteins. Reduced surface area for intestinal absorption probably resulted from villous atrophy in calves with abnormal mucosae. Impairment of absorptive ability appears to be associated with morphological changes in intestinal structure.",

The shorter villi allow better exposure of the crypts, openings of which appear as dark areas in the intervillous spaces. The irregular transverse furrows show dearly at 250\u00d7. Mucous-containing material is in the intervillous spaces. Goblet cell openings are evident on villi although they are not as numerous as in Figure 1 . The intestinal surface area available for absorption appears to be less than in the calf fed whole milk. Milk and CS contained only milk proteins, so the difference in response may stem from total protein consumed. A 50-kg calf consuming only liquid feed should receive 180 g of total crude protein (CP) per day (21) . In this experiment, a 50-kg calf fed milk received approximately 175 g of CP daily whereas a calf of similar size fed one of the milk replacers received 130 g of CP. Thus, a dietary protein or amino acid deficiency may be at least partially responsible for differences in villous structure between calves fed milk replacers and the control.

The middle of Figure 3 (right) shows crypts containing openings from several intestinal glands, as reported by Asquith et al. (1) . Some villous tips in Figure 3 appear blunted compared with tapered ones in normal villi (Figure 1 ). Shortening and blunting of villi has been reported in swine infected with TGE (29, 31) and in calves infected with calf diarrheal coronavirus (18, 19) and virus of human infantile gastroenteritis (20) .

Other appearances such as convolutions and ridges are less severely abnormal ( Figure 3 ). Nematode infestations in rats have produced flat intestinal mucosa.

Other observations were increased cell production in the crypts and increased cell migration on the villi (13, 28) .",

Villi begin to fuse at their bases by forming intervillous ridges that grow as the villi shorten. Eventually the ridges broaden and flatten and make up the entire mucosal surface. Figure 3 may represent an intermediate step in such a process. The primary defect may result from the villous surface being injured so the epithelium and basement membrane are denuded, followed by rapid proliferation and abnormal migration of epithelial cells, and increased cell loss.",

Antibodies secreted are primarily IgA and IgM classes, with the former increasing in importance with maturation of lymphocytes in the lamina propria up to 3 mo (3). But normal calves secreted little or no antibodies into the lumen in response to soy protein antigens, so those antigens may be able to avoid the local immune system. Barratt and Porter (3) reported an unusually high serum antibody response of IgG class to ingested soy antigens. The differences between calves fed SF and PC were not expected from previous work (25) . Possibly PC, containing a more concentrated soy protein product, is more antigenic than SF in young calves. Another explanation is the possibility of a dietary amino acid deficiency. Since protein quality declines with successive steps in purification of soy protein, PC may be lower than SF in one or more essential amino acids. Further research is needed on the physiological response of calves to dietary soy proteins.",

            "text": "The progression of morphological changes in intestinal mucosa during disease syndromes (12) indicates that the process may develop gradually in calves fed soy proteins. We found that feeding PC produced markedly abnormal intestinal morphology in a calf sacrificed at 9 wk. Scanning electron microscopy revealed shortened, convoluted, and twisted villi with an apparently reduced surface area for absorption (Seegraber and Morrill, unpublished) . We also found that intestinal biopsies on calves fed PC have shown progressive villous atrophy, which was reversed by changing rations to whole milk. Intestinal biopsy is preferable to sacrificing animals both for economic reasons and because it permits monitoring changes chronologically, so an animal may serve as its own control. An intestinal biopsy technique for calves has been described (26) . We now are using SEM and LM with intestinal biopsies at regular intervals to study calves fed soy proteins. Other measurements include xylose absorption and serum immunoglublin, and the regenerative ability of intestinal mucosa after a diet is changed. CONCLUSIONS Impaired intestinal absorptive ability, shown by xylose tests, appeared to be associated with morphological changes in intestinal structure seen via SEM in calves fed soy proteins. Structural changes similar to those reported from TGE in swine, celiac disease in man, viral infections in calves, and nematode infestation in rats were observed. Perhaps the intestinal mucosa responds via a similar progression of degenerative stages to insults or injuries of widely differing origins. Feeding whole milk produced intestinal villi similar to those reported in normal calves and other species. Normal villi were associated with increased ability to absorb xylose. When more is known about soy proteins, their antigenicity, and their effects in calves, methods to eliminate problems with soy proteins may lead to increased use of soy products by preruminant calves.",
