Here we present the crystal structure of a disk-shaped octameric form of VP40 formed by release by interacting with cellular factors [12, 16-18]. VP40 also associates with RNP structures in vivo [19] four antiparallel homodimers of the N-terminal domain. The octamer binds an RNA triribonucleotide and it has been reported to localize to late endosomal membranes [20]. Matrix protein/RNP interactions have containing the sequence 5-U-G-A-3 through its inner pore surface, and its oligomerization and RNA binding been reported for a number of enveloped viruses [21-24].
