            "text": "We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.",

The first patient showing symptoms was recorded by Chinese authorities on 8 December 2019 [1] . On 9 January 2020, WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus had been isolated from one of the hospitalized persons [2] , and the first death case was reported on the same day. The first case outside China was witnessed on 13 January in Thailand [3] , and in the following days, several other countries also reported 2019-nCoV cases [4] . The first confirmed cases in China, but outside Hubei province, were reported on 19 January. [4] . As of 1 February, there were 14,628 confirmed cases worldwide (out of which 14,451 happened in China) with 305 total deaths [5] .",

We impose time dependence in the transmission parameter due to the control measures progressively implemented by Chinese authorities on and after 23 January. With our baseline R 0 = 2.6, disease control is achieved when more than 61.5% of potential transmissions are prevented. We introduce a key parameter t * to denote the future time when control measures reach their full potential. For this study we assume it to be in the range of 20-50 days after 23 January.

This way, we evaluated the probability that a single infected individual is traveling from the index areas (in our case Chinese provinces other than Hubei) to a specific destination. Using a ten day interval for potential travel after exposure (just as in [15] ), one can find from EpiRisk that in the January-February periods, assuming usual travel volumes, there is a 1/554 probability that a single case will travel abroad and cause an exported case outside China. The dataset for relative importation risks of countries is available as well; thus, one can obtain the probability of an exported case appearing in a specific country. This probability is denoted by \u03b8 0 , and we call it the baseline connectivity of that country with China. The baseline connectivity can be affected by other factors, such as the reduction in travel volume between the index and destination areas, exit screening in China, and the efficacy of entry screening at the destination country. Hence, we have a compound parameter, the actual connectivity \u03b8, which expresses the probability that a case in China outside Hubei will be eventually mixed into the population of the destination country. For example, the relative risk of Japan is 0.13343, meaning that 13.343% of all exportations are expected to appear in Japan. Thus, under normal circumstances, the probability that a case from China eventually ends up in Japan is 0.13343/554 = 2.41 \u00d7 10 \u22124 during the January-February period [32] . Assuming a 20% reduction in travel volume between China and Japan, this baseline connectivity is reduced to a connectivity 0.8 \u00d7 2.41 \u00d7 10 \u22124 = 1.928 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Additionally, assuming a 40% efficacy on entry screening [33] , there is a 0.6 probability that an arriving case passes the screening, and the connectivity parameter is further reduced to 0.6 \u00d7 1.928 \u00d7 10 \u22124 = 1.16 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . If we assume interventions at the originating area, for example, exit screening with 25% efficacy, then our actual connectivity parameter is \u03b8 = 0.75 \u00d7 1.16 \u00d7 10 \u22124 = 8.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , which represents the probability that a case in China will eventually mix into the population in Japan. Assuming independence, this \u03b8, together with the cumulative cases C, generates a binomial distribution of importations that enter the population of a given country.",

Each branch has extinction probability z, which is the unique solution of the equation z = g(z) on the interval (0, 1), where g is the generating function of the offspring distribution (see [34] ).

Smaller t * corresponds to more rapid implementation of the control measures.

They have similar baseline connectivity \u03b8, and we focus on how travel restrictions and entry screenings can potentially reduce their risks, assuming different values of R loc in the case C = 150,000 (on the left of Figure 3 ) and C = 600,000 (on the right of Figure 3 ). For illustration purposes, we plotted Thailand (red) and the Republic of Korea (blue), but Taiwan and Japan are always between those two curves. We can see that, for example, on the right of Figure 3 for C = 600,000, unless R loc is very small, considerable reduction of the outbreak risk can be achieved only by extreme measures that prevent most importations. In Figure 4 , we assumed that European countries have very similar R loc and looked at their risks as a function of the number of cases. For illustration purposes, we selected countries which have relatively high (UK, Germany, France, Italy), medium (Belgium, Poland, Hungary), and low (Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania) connectivity to China. On the left, we assumed R loc = 1.4 and baseline \u03b8, and with these parameters, outbreaks will likely occur in high risk countries as the case number approaches one million.

In this study, we used a range of R loc values between the critical value 1 and the baseline R 0 = 2.6. A further source of uncertainty is in the distribution of the generation time interval, since a different distribution gives a different outbreak risk even with the same R loc . For our calculations, we used the distribution from [19] (see also [20] ); a more in-depth discussion of this topic may be found in [36] . Knowing R loc and the generation interval are needed not only to have a better quantitative risk estimation, but also for guidance as to which types of control measures may reduce the outbreak risk the most effectively.

Given that disease fatalities do not have significant effect on the total population, we ignored them in the transmission model to ease the calculations (i.e., \u00b5 = 0 was used).

To predict the final number of cases outside Hubei, we assume a gradually increasing control u from zero until a saturation point, and define t * the time when the eventual control u max is achieved.

Based on the maximal likelihood of case numbers that produce the observed number of exportations using EpiRisk [32] , we estimate that the reported confirmed cases represent only 6.3% of the total cases for the regions outside Hubei (other estimates for ascertainment rate were: 5.1% [22] , 10% in [38] , and 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0) [39] ), see the inset in Figure 1 .
