In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kawasaki disease and insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene. Fifty five Kawasaki disease patients and 43 healthy children were enrolled. ACE genotype was evaluated from each of the subjects' DNA fragments through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequencies of ACE genotypes (DD, ID, II) were 12.7%, 60.0%, 27.3% in Kawasaki group, and 41.9%, 30.2%, 27.9% in control group respectively, indicating low rate of DD and high rate of ID genotype among Kawasaki patients (p<0.01). Comparing allelic (I, D) frequencies, I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group (57.3% vs. 43.0%, p<0.05). In Kawasaki group, both genotype and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between those with coronary dilatations and those without. ACE gene I/D polymorphism is thought to be associated with Kawasaki disease but not with the development of coronary dilatations.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme is an ectoenzyme found on the external surface of the endothelial and epithelial cell membranes. It enhances the synthesis of angiotensin-II, that promotes proliferation, migration, and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II also induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (16, 17) . Moreover, the increased free radical generation by angiotensin-II contributes to endothelial dysfunction (18, 19) .",

Danser et al. explained the higher ACE levels observed in subjects with D allele than those with the II genotype by the sequence harbored in the insert of ACE gene. This sequence was said to be very similar to a silencer element (22) .

And I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group. However, both genotype (DD, ID, II) and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between Kawasaki disease patients with coronary dilatations and those without. Therefore, ACE gene I/D polymorphism was thought to be associated with the prevalence of Kawasaki disease but not with the development of coronary lesions. These results are similar to the report by Wu et al. (13) that the DD genotype was present in lower frequency among Kawasaki patients and ACE polymorphism was not associated with coronary aneurysmal formation. These results are different from the study by Takeuchi et al. (27) that the II genotype of ACE gene is more prevalent in Kawasaki disease and those with coronary aneurysm.

In addition, there are no significant association between ACE I/D polymorphism and the coronary artery aneurysm formation in Kawasaki disease patients. Because the study groups are relatively small size in number, it is difficult to generalize these results. In this study, the coronary arterial dilatation was observed in 17 out of 55 Kawasaki patients. This is higher than that in previously reported literature. It can be accounted for either 1) longer duration from the onset of illness to the infusion of immunoglobulin, 2) other factors that may affect the development of coronary arterial lesions in Kawasaki disease, such as different ethinicity or 3) selection bias caused by limited number of enrolled institution and small number of patients. IVIG is recommended to be given within the first 10 days of illness and, if possible, within 7 days of illness. Since the duration of febrile days before the diagnosis and the IVIG infusion were 4.6\u00b11.6 days (range, 2-8 days) in our study groups, the first explanation seems less likely.",
