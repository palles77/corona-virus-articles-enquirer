However, compliance with long-term treatment with estrogen for menopausal women is poor because of side effects. In addition, the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study reported that hormone replacement therapy increased the risk of developing memory deficits in postmenopausal women of 65 years of age or older (8, 9) . Therefore, the development of safer and more effective drug therapies has been strongly anticipated by postmenopausal women with memory deficits.",

The resulting placental extract is assumed to contain estrogenic hormones, growth factors, and other biologically active substances. Generally, for clinical use, one ample including 112 mg of human placental extract can be used per day per person by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. In this study, the proper oral dosage was calculated to be 120 mg/kg with reference to one ample for a 60 kg human, using the formula for dose translation based on body surface area (23) . In accordance with previous animal studies (24, 25) , the present study was further designed to examine the effect of a high dose of placental extract (2160 mg/kg).",

The present study was aimed to clarify how treatment with porcine placental extract influences the memory deficits and morphological changes in OVX/stress-subjected mice. We found that daily placental extract treatment attenuated fear memory impairment and hippocampal neuronal loss in OVX/stress-subjected mice, as did estrogen replacement (22) . This is the first pharmacological evidence to demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of placental extract. Further, we found that treatment with placental extract did not affect the gain in body weight and decreases in bone mineral density and uterine weight in OVX mice, although estrogen replacement did have effects on them (22) .

In addition, these studies indicated that overburden of 21 days of repeated restraint stress (6 h/day) markedly decreased the numbers of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons in the OVX animals, while each caused a slight decrease in cell number, and that memory impairment was only observed in the OVX/ stress-subjected animals. Thus, in this study, all OVX mice received chronic stress to determine the effect of placental extract on memory deficits and neuromorphological change more simply. Moreover, in this study we examined the effects of placental extract at two doses (120 and 2160 mg/kg) on OVX/stress-induced pathophysiological changes, to assess drug efficacy and some aspects of potential toxicity. Similar to our previous finding on the effects of EGb 761, the results of this study indicated that placental extract at doses of both 120 and 2160 mg/kg did not cause adverse side effects and attenuated the OVX/stress-induced fear memory impairment in female mice without affecting gain in body weight and decreases in bone mineral density and uterine weight. The present study also revealed that treatment with placental extract attenuated the OVX/stress-induced loss of Nissl-positive cells in the hippocampal CA3 region. To date, there is no direct evidence indicating the relationship between the hippocampal CA3 atrophy and memory loss during menopause. On the other hand, evidence-based clinical research, which reviews the systematic identification of randomized clinical trials, demonstrates that surgical menopause may be accompanied by cognitive impairment that primarily affects episodic memory (31) . In addition, a growing number of animal studies indicate that the hippocampal CA3 pathology is associated with the episodic-like memory dysfunction (32 -34) . Furthermore, Luques et al. (35) have demonstrated that a selective reduction of hippocampal cholinergic innervation is associated with impairment in episodic memory, as well as in spatial learning. Taken together with our previous findings showing that the cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil and galantamine ameliorated OVX/CS-induced memory impairment (22), the present study suggests that placental extract ameliorates memory impairment in OVX/stress mice by neuroprotection in the CA3 region and further that placental extract has therapeutic efficiency against memory problems in postmenopausal women. Placental extracts contain a variety of bioactive molecules, such as proteins, peptides, glycosaminoglycans, amino acids, RNA, and DNA, and thus all of these may contribute to the regenerating effects (36) . Among them, possible molecules that may be bioactive via oral administration are unknown. It appears that the large molecular size of proteins, such as hormones, enzymes, growth factors and cytokines, makes them unlikely candidates because orally administered proteins usually undergo intestinal digestion and cannot enter the general circulation. Interestingly, Alkam et al. (37) recently reported that chronic oral treatment with Leu-Ile, a hydrophobic dipeptide, prevents the impairment of recognition memory induced by amyloid \u03b2 peptide in mice. Therefore, we speculate that possible bioactive molecules via oral administration are small in molecular size, such as dipeptides, which can enter the general circulation without intestinal digestion (38, 39) . Further study is required to identify such bioactive molecules from placental extracts.",

Estrogens are known to exert various neuromodulating actions by the expression of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (40) , which affects neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity (41 -43) . In addition, estrogens also play a greater role in uterine responsiveness and function (44) , bone formation (45) , and bone remodeling (46) . Therefore, the present study indicates that estrogen could not be involved in the neuroprotective effects by placental extract because the extract had no effects on bone mineral density and the weight of the uterus in OVX mice.",

That is, our findings have demonstrated that stress-related molecules may act as a mediator of neuronal loss under the estrogendepleted condition. Glucocorticoid is well known to be secreted in response to stress, and Kim et al. (47) have revealed that glucocorticoid receptor activation by dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist, blocks both proliferation and differentiation in hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, Tongjaroenbuangam et al. (48) have recently showed that the administration of dexamethasone causes neuronal death in the CA3 layer of the hippocampus and that okra (Abelmoschus esculentus Linn.) extract and its derivatives, quercetin and rutin, protect the dexamethasoneinduced neuronal death in mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that glucocorticoid-mediated mechanisms are responsible for hippocampal neuronal dysfunction. Thus, although further experiments are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms of neuroprotection by placental extracts, we suppose that bioactive molecules in placental extracts alleviate glucocorticoid-mediated hippocampal neuronal dysfunction.",
