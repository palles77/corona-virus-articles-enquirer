Both antibody classes can persist in serum for months after exposure. Depending on the assay used, cross-reactivity with B. burgdorferi antigens used in IFA and ELISA can occur with other spirochetes; thus a positive titer does not always document exposure to B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi vaccines induce antibodies that are detected by some IFA and ELISA. Western immunoblot can be used to differentiate vaccine-induced antibodies from antibodies resulting from natural infection. Antibodies against the C6 peptide of B. burgdorferi are rarely induced by vaccination; point-of-care assays using this peptide are commercially available. 55 Because B. burgdorferi migrates through the tissues, most dogs with borreliosis are positive for antibodies by the time illness is detected. Healthy dogs develop the same antibody responses as clinically ill dogs, however. Because of these factors, interpretation of positive serum antibody titers is difficult.

False-negative results can occur in immature dogs, in peracute cases, or in dogs with concurrent immunosuppression. Antibodies against B. gibsoni and B. canis may or may not cross-react, depending on the antigen source used by a particular laboratory, and so specific IFA should be used for both organisms. DNA of B. canis and B. gibsoni can be amplified by PCR assay, and positive results indicate current infection. 6, 17 However, both antibodies and DNA can be detected in dogs that are healthy and those that are clinically ill. Antibody titer magnitude does not correlate to the presence or absence of disease. A titer of greater than 1 : 320 was suggested for B. gibsoni, but not all infected dogs achieve a titer of this magnitude. 7 It is important to determine which species are involved in a case because response to treatment varies. Duration of positive titers after resolution of disease is unknown. In untreated experimentally infected dogs, titers remained high for at least 6 months.

Initial positive results in a recently marketed point-of-care test occur at approximately 1 : 100. Positive titers revert to negative 3 to 9 months after resolution of infection; persistence of titers for greater than or equal to 9 months suggests a carrier state. However, positive antibody titers have been detected for months after apparently successful therapy in some naturally infected dogs. 5 Clinically ill, seropositive dogs should be treated a minimum of 28 days and until clinical and laboratory abnormalities have resolved. 66 Whether to treat healthy, seropositive dogs is controversial; the issues involved in this decision were recently reviewed. 40, 66 The clinician can make a definitive diagnosis of E. canis infection by demonstrating morulae (i.e., clusters of the organism) in mononuclear cells, culture, or PCR assay. Morulae are rarely found on routine blood smear or bone marrow aspiration cytology unless the dog has been immunosuppressed. Cytology and PCR assay results can be falsely negative in dogs that have been treated. Ehrlichia spp. can be isolated by tissue culture of heparinized infected canine blood or bone marrow aspiration samples, but culture is of limited availability, expensive, and of low yield.

The Consensus Statement on Ehrlichial Disease of Small Animals from the Infectious Disease Study Group of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) 66 states the following: disease first occur and can be immediately assessed by PCR assay or have repeat serology performed in approximately 2 weeks to evaluate for seroconversion. Alternately, both assays can be performed at the same time. Antibiotic therapy can lead to falsely negative PCR assay results. A. phagocytophilum DNA and antibodies can be detected in both healthy and clinically ill dogs, and so positive test results do not document clinical illness.

In dogs with clinical illness because of RMSF, IgM antibody titers are generally positive. Because IgM has short duration in serum, false-negative results may occur with IgM testing. False-positive results are most common in the IgM ELISA. Positive IgG titers are detectable 20 to 25 days after infection. Serum samples with IgG titers greater than or equal to 1 : 64 are generally considered positive. If IgG or IgM antibodies are not detected in a patient with clinical and laboratory evidence of RMSF, a convalescent IgG titer 2 to 3 weeks later is recommended.

False-positive results can occur in CSF samples contaminated with blood. Concurrent measurement of serum antibody concentrations can be helpful; if CSF concentrations are greater than serum concentrations, the antibody in CSF had to be produced locally and suggests CNS distemper. Detection of serum IgG antibodies is of minimal diagnostic value because a positive titer could develop secondary to vaccination or previous exposure. A fourfold increase in serum IgG titer over a 3-to 4-week period suggests recent infection. Detection of circulating IgM antibodies is consistent with recent infection but not clinical disease. A point-of-care assay for detection of canine distemper antibodies is available. Vaccinated dogs that are seropositive in this assay probably do not need to be boosted. A presumptive diagnosis of distemper encephalitis can be made with increased CSF protein and leukocytes (lymphocytes predominating) plus a positive CSF antibody titer in a sample not contaminated with peripheral blood. Definitive diagnosis of canine distemper infection requires demonstration of viral inclusions by cytologic examination (see Figure  15 -3A and B), direct fluorescent antibody staining of cytologic or histopathologic specimens, histopathologic evaluation, or reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) documentation of distemper viral RNA in peripheral blood, CSF, or conjunctival scrapings. (Table 15 -1; See Appendix I: Select Laboratories for Infectious Disease.) Positive RT-PCR test results can be induced by modified live vaccination. Viral inclusions can rarely be found in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and leukocyte precursors of infected dogs. Inclusions are generally present for only 2 to 9 days after infection and therefore often are not present when clinical signs occur. Inclusions may be easier to find in smears made from buffy coats or bone marrow aspirates than those made from peripheral blood. Viral particles can be detected by immunofluorescence in cells from the tonsils, respiratory tree, urinary tract, conjunctival scrapings, and CSF for 5 to 21 days after infection.",

Serologic cross-reactivity between B. vinsonii and B. henselae is variable; therefore individual assays for both agents are indicated. Antibodies can be detected in dogs with and without clinical signs. Seronegative test results make clinical illness caused by B. vinsonii or B. henselae less likely. However, many infected dogs have been falsely negative for Bartonella spp. antibodies. Thus the current recommendation is to combine serologic test results with PCR assay or culture. Bartonella spp. are more difficult to amplify or culture from dog blood than cat blood. The gold standard test for documentation of Bartonella spp. infection is the combination of culture on BAPGM media with PCR assay (Galaxy Diagnostic, Inc). 25,59 (See Appendix I: Select Laboratories for Infectious Disease.) As in cats, no test result proves clinical bartonellosis in dogs, but if test results are positive and there is no better explanation for the cause of illness, treatment may be indicated.",
