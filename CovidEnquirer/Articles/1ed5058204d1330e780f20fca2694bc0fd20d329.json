For example, diarrhea associated with infections resulting from oral-fecal contamination is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, primarily in Africa and South Asia (2) . A number of diarrhea studies have been carried out in different countries. For instance, in Germany, a nationwide representative cross-sectional telephone survey of 21262 adults over a 12-month period during 2008 and 2009, was conducted. Participants were asked if they had had either AGI-related diarrhea or vomiting in a 4-week recall period. The burden of diarrhea was estimated to be quite high: 0.95 episodes/person per year (95% confidence interval 0\u00b790-0\u00b799) (3) . In Slovenia, a population-based self-reported acute gastrointestinal infection (AGI) cross sectional study was carried out in June 2011. The comparison of the incidence of AGI-based on notification in June 2011, and incidence-based on the results of the study showed that the latter incidence was 56 times higher than the first one. The burden of AGI among population of Slovenia is quite high. The cross sectional study should be repeated and laboratory analysis of acute AGI cases added to get a better insight of epidemiological situation (4).",

Diarrheal disease due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death, is declining worldwide (8) . Halving a number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water had an enormous impact on decreasing the incidence of diarrheal diseases (9) . A comprehensive literature review identifies 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans, including 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. Out of these, 868 (61%) are zoonotic, that is, they can be transmitted between humans and animals (10) Hygienic measures, socio-economic changes and climatic changes have a significant impact on the emergence and spread of water-associated microorganisms. The occurrence of some has gradually been reduced, e.g. typhoid fever, while the incidence of others has risen: Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, noroviruses, Cryptosporidium and Giardia (12) . Some new pathogens include environmental bacteria and viruses that are highly capable of surviving and proliferating in water distribution systems. Moreover, they are highly resistant to chemical disinfecting procedures (12) . Waterborne viruses are gaining in importance as etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis. In children, they cause mixed viral infections with a severe clinical picture (12) .",

However, the incidence is calculated according to notified cases. As only a fraction of overall cases appear as notifications, the real burden of AGI is expected to be much higher. Among microbiologically confirmed notified AGI cases, the most frequent ones were noroviral (the incidence rate in 2010 was 21/100 000) and rotaviral infections (the incidence rate 78/100 000). Viral gastrointestinal infections are followed by AGI, caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli. The epidemiological situation in EU countries is similar: Campylobacter infections are the most frequently reported bacterial gastrointestinal infections. In 2010, the total EU incidence was 57/100 000 inhabitants. Reported rates are increasing; most cases are sporadic, with high seasonal peaks in the summer, but multinational outbreaks are infrequent. Salmonella infection remains the second most commonly identified gastrointestinal disease across EU, with the total incidence of 21/100 000 inhabitants in 2010. The reported incidence of Salmonella infection has been declining steadily since 2004, partly due to EU control programmes in poultry farms. However, Salmonella continues to be the source of many outbreaks, both within and between countries (18) . The data for incidences of viral gastroenterocolitis are not available.",

The real burden is probably much higher as many patients with acute gastroenterocolitis do not seek medical help, as vomiting or diarrhoea are mostly self-limiting and of short duration. Even when the patient consults the doctor -e.g. suffering from a more severe disease, or simply in need of the certificate for a sick-leave -the obligation to notify is probably often overlooked by the physician. Children younger than four years of age account for more than half of all the notified cases.

Shigella flexneri and sonnei were the predominant pathogens in the first decade, causing half of the WBOs. The number of notified WBOs has declined in recent years and the aetiology has changed (25) . There were only one to two WBOs per year in the last ten years, and most of them were caused by viruses (most often noroviruses) (21). Noroviruses were identified as an important cause of outbreaks in different settings, including WBOs also in Sweden (26) . Craun and co-workers (2010) comprehensively described outbreaks associated with drinking water in the US from 1971 to 2006. A drop in the number of notified outbreaks related to drinking water has been observed as well, especially in public systems. The decline was attributed to improved infrastructure and the impact of national regulations (27) . Individual water systems and systems supplied by ground water were more at risk of contamination (27) . A high prevalence of enteric viruses has been found in untreated individual drinking water sources in Slovenia as well (28) . Drinking water quality in Slovenia is generally good, especially in large water supply zones, but it is not of the same quality in all parts of the country: microbiological problems are found in small water supply zones in rural areas, and contamination with nitrates and pesticides in some areas with extensive agriculture (the North-Eastern part of the country). Without doubt, it has not been significantly improved in the 2004-2010 period (16) .",

The risk for AGI in the larger supply zones was lower for those users who were supplied with contaminated water -an unexpected finding which is difficult to interpret. It may be that users in large supply zones (mainly in bigger cities) are inclined to drink bottled water and, therefore, the temporary contamination does not have an augmenting effect on AGI. Another possible explanation might be that larger water supply systems are better controlled, that any change in water quality is detected immediately, and that consumers are instructed not to use water for drinking/cooking without boiling.",
