Controls consisted of an ammonia-N-exposed control group (N), a WSSV-challenged positive control group (W), and an untreated control group (control). Immune parameters measured were total haemocyte count (THC), haemocyte phagocytosis, plasma protein content and haemolymph enzymatic activities for prophenoloxidase (proPO), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). THC and plasma protein had downward trends with time in all treatment groups (NW, N, and W) in contrast to the untreated control group (control). The percentage phagocytosis, NOS activity, and ALP and proPO activity of W and NW decreased initially then increased from 6 to 78 h (except for NOS and ALP, from 6 to 54 h) before declining thereafter until the end of the experiment. Compared with untreated controls (control), there was a downward trend for all measured parameters in the treatment groups (N, NW, and W), but the degree was WNNWNN. WSSV was detected at 78 h 0044-8486/$ -see front matter D postchallenge in both W and NW. In conclusion, 5 mg l \u00c01 ammonia-N reduced the immunocompetence of P. japonicus and may have decreased the virulence of WSSV. D",

However, throughout the last decade, we have become increasingly aware of the socio-economic and environmental unsustainability of shrimp aquaculture industry because shrimp farming has always been affected by infectious diseases, mainly of bacterial and viral epidemics, together with water quality (Kautsky et al., 2000) , causing great loss to production. White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the causative agent of a new viral disease that has caused a high shrimp mortality and severe damage to shrimp cultures throughout the world (Peng et al., 1998) . The disease spreads very rapidly and, by 1994, it had severely impacted most of the shrimp farming regions of Southeast Asia including Japan, China, India, and Korea Wang et al., 1995; Cai et al., 1995) . Subsequently, WSSV spread to many countries of the western hemisphere. It was detected in the United States, central America, and south America (Kautsky et al., 2000) . For this reason, WSSV prevention and control are priorities and shrimp immunology has become a prime area of research. Furthermore, it is very important to notice that environmental stressors can affect shrimp immunity.",

The major part of ammonia is excreted mainly through the gill epithelium (Regnault, 1987; Kinne, 1976 ) through diffusion of NH 3 and NH 4 + and Na/NH 4 + exchanges (Pequeux and Gills, 1981; Pressley et al., 1981; Cameron, 1986) .

Accumulation of ammonia may cause the deterioration of water quality and threaten the growth of cultured penaeids (Chen and Lin, 1992a,b,c) .

            "text": "For crustaceans, some information exists on the importance of THC in pathogen and environmental stress resistance. For instance, Persson et al. (1987) reported in Pacifastacus leniusculus a relationship between haemocytes and its resistance to the parasitic fungus, Aphanomyces astaci. They demonstrated that a decrease in the haemocyte number of crayfish harboring A. astaci as a latent infection resulted in an acute infection with incomplete melanization of fungus hyphae, leading to the death of the crayfish. Le Moullac et al. (1998) observed that Penaeus styliriostris with low THC resulting from exposure to hypoxia became more sensitive to infections with highly virulent Vibrio alginolyticus. In respect of environmental stress, Smith et al. (1995) reported that common shrimp Crangon crangon exposed to the dredge spoils were found to display an elevation in recoverable haemolymph volume and a reduction in THC. P. stylirostris, following exposure to ammonia at 3 mg l \u00c01 , decreased its THC by 30% (Le Moullac and Haffner, 2000) . Plasma protein plays a vital role in the immunity of crustaceans; it not only correlates with the infection of pathogen (Vogan and Rowley, 2002; Song et al., 2003) but also with environmental stress (Chen et al., 1994a,b) ; thus, it is a very important immunological tool of penaeid shrimp because several immune molecules have been identified and purified in crustaceans such as LPS-binding protein, hglucan-binding protein, and clotting protein (Sritunyalucksana and S\u00f6 derh\u00e4ll, 2000) . Zhang et al. (2004) isolated two peptides with molecular masses of 73 and 75 kDa that had nonspecific antiviral properties and no cytotoxity against host cells from Penaeus monodon hemocyanin. The data from the present study show that both ammonia-N and WSSV caused the plasma protein and THC of P. japonicus to decrease significantly. The reasons for the phenomena may be as follows: there may be two pathways that cause THC to decline: (1) WSSV invades and destroys the haematopoietic tissue to cause the obstruction of haematopoiesis, and (2) WSSV invades and degrades haemocytes directly. Here, pathway (1) above may cause the general decline of plasma protein concentrations, but at an early stage of WSSV infection, the plasma protein concentrations of W are higher than other treatments, maybe due to WSSV causing haemocyte lysing and releasing protein into the plasma. In addition, exposure of shrimp to ammonia-N caused accumulation of haemolymph ammonia and urea, and caused the catabolism of haemocyanin and protein to free amino acids. This is the main reason for the decrease in plasma protein concentrations caused by high ammonia-N of water (Chen et al., 1993 (Chen et al., , 1994a .",

            "text": "The proPO activity, NOS activity, ALP activity, and percentage phagocytosis of W and NW have similar trends with the time elapsed, namely, the percentage phagocytosis, ALP activity, NOS activity, and proPO activity of W and NW decreased when they were infected with WSSV initially, but from 6 to 78 h (with the exception of NOS and ALP at 54 h), they had an upward trend then decreased until the end of the experiment (Figs. 2, (4) (5) (6) . The trends of proPO activity, NOS activity, and percentage phagocytosis of N are similar (Figs. 2, 5, and 6)-all had an upward trend then declined. The variations of immune parameters of P. japonicus under the stimulation of WSSV and stress of 5 mg l \u00c01 ammonia-N stress imply that 5 mg l \u00c01 ammonia-N stress affects the immune system of P. japonicus and the components of the immune system produce resistant response to the stress, in respect of WSSV, at the early stage of infection, WSSV stimulates the immune system of P. japonicus, upregulating then downregulating them. During the period of these immune parameter upregulation, P. japonicus was diagnosed as WSSV-negative by DNA dot blot hybridization; therefore, the implication is that P. japonicus has immune responses to WSSV and can resist it; but with the time of infection, WSSV destroys it. The immune parameters we employed in the present study are very important components of the immune system of invertebrates. The proPO cascade system can cause melanin formation, stimulation of phagocytosis, nodule formation, encapsulation, and clotting (S\u00f6 derh\u00e4ll and Cerenius, 1998; Sritunyalucksana and S\u00f6 derh\u00e4ll, 2000; Gillespie et al., 1997) , and mediate to generate proteins like antibacterial peptides (S\u00f6 derh\u00e4ll and Smith, 1986; Lee and Soderhall, 2002) . Rojtinnakorn et al. (2002) reported some proteins, including proPO, that are involved in the defence mechanism of P. japonicus to WSSV invasion. Nitric oxide produced by NOS is associated with diverse actions in neurotransmission, vascular systems, and immunity, including antimicrobial and antiviral activities by way of inhibiting DNA as well as protein and lipid synthesis (Bredt and Snyder, 1994; Karupiah et al., 1993; Howe et al., 2002; Lepoivre et al., 1990) . Thus, the NOS system is a very important component in innate immune system that is related directly to virus killing, such as poliovirus (L\u00f3 pez-Guerrero and Carrasco, 1998), picornavirus (Sanders et al., 1998) , flavivirus (Kreil and Eibl, 1996) , coronavirus (Lane et al., 1997) , arenavirus (Campbell et al., 1994) , rhabdovirus (Bi and Reiss, 1995) , and ACID virus (Raber et al., 1996) . As an innate immune effector, NOS can be induced to produce upregulation of NO in many invertebrates by the invasion of bacteria and parasites (Luckhart and Li, 2001; Dimopoulos et al., 2001; Nappi et al., 2000) . As a response of the host to the virus, viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus induced turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) kidney macrophages to produce an upregulation of NO (Tafalla et al., 1999) . Hepatitis virus and poliovirus infection induced human cell lines to produce an upregulation of NO (L\u00f3 pez- Guerrero and Carrasco, 1998; Majano et al., 1998) . Although the role of NO in the pathogenesis of viral infection has been demonstrated on many occasions (Kreil and Eibl, 1996; Adler et al., 1997) , invertebrate organisms also contain nitric oxide and appear to use this multidimensional molecules in a similar manner as noted for mammals (Stefano and Ottaviani, 2000) . As to the NOS activity of penaeid shrimps in response to viral infections has not been reported, our data show that the NOS of P. japonicus seems to defend against WSSV at the early stage of infection, but with the time of infection, this type of action has been decreasing. As to the role of NOS in the immune system of penaeids, this need further evidence to verify it.",

Our data also indicated that 5 mg 1 \u00c0l ammonia-N affects the immune parameters, but less seriously than WSSV. As we observed, the ammonium-N concentration of 5 mg l \u00c01 had no dramatic impacts on the shrimp's appetite, so to our surprise, 5 mg l \u00c01 ammonia-N as a toxicant concentration did not strengthen but rather reduced the susceptibility of P. japonicus to WSSV. Environmental parameters are considered to relate to disease outbreaks by affecting not only the health and defence mechanisms of the host, but also the virulence and density of pathogens. WSSV became completely noninfectious after 60 min of UV irradiation [9\u00c210 (5) AW s cm \u00c01 (2)], by 55 and 70 8C heat treatment within 90 and 5 min, by high acidity (pH 1 for 10 min and pH 3 for 1 h) and high alkalinity (pH 12 for 10 min at 25 8C), by ozone (0.5 Ag ml \u00c01 as a total residual oxidant for 10 min at 25 8C), and by 100 ppm of sodium hypochlorite and povidone iodine and 75 ppm of benzalkonium chloride for 10 min at 25 8C . In our present studies, we adopted oral infection; thus, ammonia-N reduced the immunocompetence of P. japonicus and may decrease the virulence of WSSV, too.",
