A nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab was obtained from each patient during admission. All samples were maintained at 4\u00b0C until submission to the virology laboratory and were tested for respiratory viruses by nucleic acid testing. Results: A total of 60 patients with asthma exacerbations were recruited for this study. Of the 60 samples collected from the patients with acute asthma exacerbations, rhinovirus was detected in 12 patients (20%), respiratory syncytial virus in 5 (8%), adenovirus in 5 (8%), and influenza virus in 1 (1.6%). Respiratory pathogens were not detected in 37 (61%) samples. All the samples investigated showed single viral infection. Conclusions: To conclude, the most common viruses detected were rhinovirus followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. RSV was more commonly associated with more severe attacks. Both the study design (e.g., time of sampling, age of the patients, etc.) and also the method used for viral detection influence the frequency of detection of the respiratory viruses.",

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness may occur in response to many common environmental triggers [2, 3] leading to asthma exacerbations. Asthma exacerbations are acute or subacute worsening episodes of shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness [4] , which are classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening. These exacerbations may be associated with a variety of respiratory viruses, including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenzavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus [5] , of which the first two mentioned groups are most importantly relevant to asthma development [6] . Viral respiratory infections are usually self-limiting illnesses [4] . However, they may exert profound effects on important aspects of asthma [7] . Studies suggest a substantial role for viral infections in about 50% of asthma exacerbations",

Figure 1 demonstrates the frequency of detected viruses during asthma exacerbations. All the samples that are investigated showed single viral infection. A total of 37 (61%) samples did not have any respiratory pathogens. The patients were also evaluated in three distinct groups according to their age. Three (5%) of the patients studied were under 1 year of age, 20 (33.3%) were between 1 and 5 years of age, and 37 (61.7%) were older than 5 years of age. The majority of the patients with documented viral infections in this study were between 1 and 5 years of age. Rhinovirus was the most common vial agent detected in all three age groups followed by both RSV and adenovirus. In children between 1 and 5 years of age, RSV (five patients) followed by rhinovirus (four patients) were the most common respiratory pathogens detected.",

In this study, we could identify a potential viral causative agent as the reason of acute asthma exacerbation in 23 (38%) of our patients.

Rhinovirus is common in all age groups; RSV is most important in infants and younger children. Children affected with HRV tend to be older than those affected with RSV [18] . Jartti et al. suggested the transition in dominance between HRV and RSV around 12 months of age [19, 20] . This is in accordance with the results we obtained in this study. Therefore, we could explain the preponderance of HRVinduced asthma exacerbations in this study with the longer duration of exposure and also the low number of children less than 1 year of age enrolled in this study. The same results were also obtained in the COAST study, in which HRV was found in 48% of the samples and RSV in 21% of the specimens [6] . RSV was more commonly associated with more severe attacks in this study that may be demonstrating an interplay between age at initial infection, genetic susceptibility, and virus strain, which altogether determine the outcome of the viral infection and the airway disease, which was first suggested by Saglani [20] . RSV infections, particularly the severe ones, are thought to be associated with Th2 polarization of the lung immune response with further sensitization of the host's allergic responses to other molecules [21] .",

For instance, the highest rates of virus detection are found when samples are taken as soon as symptoms commence. Viral detection becomes difficult by delaying the sampling at a time when virus shedding has been falling. Another limitation is the difficulty of diagnosing exacerbations in young children based on the clinical assessment of symptoms by both parents and clinicians. In addition, seasonal variations may significantly influence the virus identification. Extensive immunologic, virologic, and physiologic investigations during viral infections may lead toward the development of targeted therapy as a goal to personalize therapy for each asthmatic patient in the future.",
