Lesions and presence of enteropathogens on the\" mucosal surface were scored by histological examination of immunostained paraffin sections. Two or more enteropathogens were detected in 19 calves. Cryptosporidium appeared to be the principal cause of diarrhoea in six calves, rotavirus in four, Salmonella typhimurium in two, bacteria adherent to the surface of the large intestine in two, coronavirus in one and K99+ Escherichiacoli in one calf. Diarrhoea in four calves was the consequence of mixed infections in which no one enteropathogen appeared to predominate. In one calf no enteropathogen was detected. Diarrhoea was associated with infections and lesions throughout the small and large intestines. The enteropathogens most frequently. associated with lesions in the small intestines were rotavirus, coronavirus and cryptosporidium; in the large intestines they were coronavirus and bacteria apparently adherent to the mucosal surface.",

The infectious agents thought to contribute significantly are rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidium, K99+ Escherichia coli and Salmonella species, and the importance of these agents has been investigated recently by means of a survey of the microbiology of calf diarrhoea in southern Britain . During the survey, 21 moribund calves with diarrhoea were purchased and examined post mortem with the following objectives: to describe the pathology of the natural disease and to investigate diagnostic problems by studying the relationship between the lesions and infectious agents.",

Cryptosporidium was detected in one calf (18) and K99+ E coli in another (19). In the third calf (7), infection with Newbury agent extended throughout the small and large intestine but it was not possible to conclude that Newbury agent was a causal agent because the calf was infected extensively with rotavirus and cryptosporidium. Nevertheless, lesions in the small intestines of the three calves were identical to those described in calves infected experimentally with Newbury agent (Hall et alI984) . pathogens in two calves. Rotavirus was detected in eight calves, coronavirus in seven, cryptosporidium in eight and S typhimurium in one calf. In two calves (6 and 9), the surface of the large intestine was infected severely and the severity of infection of the small and large intestines by other enteropathogens was slight; in these calves the adherent bacteria appeared to be the principal cause of diarrhoea. Villi in the small intestines of these calves (6 and 9) were slightly stunted and some were fused, but these lesions could have been caused by enteropathogenic viruses which were detected in these calves. Lesions seen in the large intestines were disarrangement and exfoliation of surface enterocytes and the lamina propria was infiltrated by neutrophils. Light and electron microscopic examination of the mucosal surfaces of the large intestines of the 13 calves, in which bacteria were visible adherent to the mucosal surface, revealed variation in the nature of the bacterial colonisation and in the severity of the lesions. In seven calves (1, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 15) , electron microscopic examination revealed that the bacteria were closelyattached to the surface of enterocytes (Fig 2) , often by means of 'cups' or 'pedestals', and microvilli were effaced (Fig 3) . In the remaining six calves (2, 4, 5, 8, 14 and 16) the bacteria appeared, by light microscopy, to be adherent to the mucosal surface but examination by transmission electron microscopy revealed that, although closely associated with the musocal surface, they were not attached to the surface of enterocytes; they were detected most frequently in folds and crevices in the mucosa (Fig 4) . In some calves, bacteria formed part of an exudate together with mucus and exfoliated cells. The lesions detected in both groups were similar and comprised disarranged enterocytes, exfoliated enterocytes ( Fig 5) and infiltration of the lamina propria by neutrophils; lesions varied in severity. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that in some animals bacteria were associated closely with enterocytes which were disarranged and exfoliated, but in other animals bacteria were not adherent to the abnormal enterocytes although bacteria were associated with adjacent cells. Histological sections from the large intestines of the 13 calves in which bacteria were visible apparently adherent to the mucosal surface, were stained by the immunoperoxidase method , with a primary antiserum raised against E coli (SI02-9) which had been identified as a cause of dysentery in neonatal calves .

This study has confirmed the value of histological examination and shown the value of immunocytochemical examination of intestinal tissue removed under anaesthesia from diarrhoeic calves. The particular advantage of the immunoperoxidase method was that it allowed evaluation of mucosal infection and lesions in one histological section of paraffinembedded tissue. The finding that enteropathogens were detected more frequently by immunocytochemical examination of tissues than by microbiological examination of faeces does not lessen the value of faecal examination. Examination of faeces from several diarrhoeic calves from an outbreak, and faeces from contemporary normal calves on the same farm, is a valuable investigative procedure . Tissue examination may be helpful in instances where faecal studies have not resulted in a diagnosis.",

It is probable that in these latter calves the lesions were the result of a preceding infection by an enteropathogen; also the possibility exists in all calves that lesions could have been caused by unrecognised enteropathogens. Evaluation of infection and lesions in numerous intestinal sites revealed the severity and extent of infection and lesions in the small and large intestines. It is assumed that the cumulative effect of different infectious agents, present in the calf at the same time, infecting and damaging different parts of the intestinal tract caused loss of digestive \"and absorptive function sufficient to result in diarrhoea. The concept of an additive effect on intestinal structure and function by enteropathogens infecting different parts of the alimentary tract, is supported by the results of an earlier study of the lesions in the intestines of clinically normal rotavirus-infected calves , in which the methods used to score infection and lesions were similar to those used in this study. In rotavirus-infected calves which did not have diarrhoea, lesions and infection were severe in the upper small intestine and mild in the lower small intestine; and the large intestines were virtually undamaged. In these calves it is probable that normal absorptive function in the lower small intestine and large intestine compensated for rotavirus-induced malabsorption in the upper small intestine; this hypothesis was proposed previously to explain why experimental infection of colostrumdeprived calves with rotavirus caused only a mild diarrhoea (Logan et al 1979) . In the diarrhoeic calves in this study, where lesions caused by mixed infections occurred throughout the intestines, it is proposed that absorptive capacity was overwhelmed.",

Regardless of infectious agent, disarrangement and exfoliation of enterocytes, with a change to stunted and fused villi covered by cuboidal enterocytes, were the principal lesions. In calves infected with cryptosporidium, cuboidal enterocytes were especially prevalent, while in calves infected by S typhimurium, neutrophils were numerous in the lamina propria, in crypt abscesses and in the intestinal lumen. It was possible, however, even in the absence of immunocytochemistry, to make a presumptive diagnosis of the cause of diarrhoea by histological examination of lesions in the small intestine. Cryptosporidium and enterotoxigenic E coli were recognised on the mucosal surface following staining by the Giemsa method and S typhimurium infection was suspected by the presence of crypt abscesses and neutrophils in the lamina propria and intestinal lumen. The possibility of confusion between the lesions produced by Salmonella species and enteropathogenic E coli remains because both cause infiltration of the mucosa with neutrophils. Lesions induced by enteropathogenic E coli have been described as occurring primarily in the large intestine with little involvement of the small intestine . However, a strain which causes severe lesions in the small intestine has been recognised (G. R. Pearson, personal communication) and in this study a mixed infection of the small intestine with S typhimurium and an E coli sero-. logically identical to the enteropathogenic strain E coli (S102-9) was detected in one calf (I). Remaining cases were assumed to be virus-induced but the association of lesions with a particular virus could only be made by immunostaining for viral antigen.",

Previous studies of rotavirus infections in calves, which have examined the distribution of rotavirus-infected cells using the immunofluorescence technique on cryostat sections, have failed to detect rotavirus-infected enterocytes in the large intestine (Mebus and Newman 1977, Pearson et a11978, Jubb et alI985) . The detection of rotavirus-infected enterocytes in the large intestines of calves in this study is probably the result of a greater sensitivity shown by the immunoperoxidase method. Six calves were affected by bacteria adherent to the mucosal surface, in the absence of coronavirus infection, and bacterial infection resulted in disarranged and exfoliated enterocytes, together with neutrophils in the lamina propria. In two calves, coronavirus had caused characteristic lesions (Mebus et al 1973) . Bacteria apparently adherent to the surface of the large intestine of diarrhoeic calves have not been recognised in neonatal calf diarrhoea except in a dysentery of calves caused by E coli (S102-9) .",

Four of the calves originated from one farm and this was the farm on which the outbreak of calf dysentery had occurred ; the fifth calf originated from a separate outbreak. Two other calves were examined from the farm on which the former outbreak of calf dysentery occurred. Lesions were detected in the large intestines of these calves which were indistinguishable from those described in association with enteropathogenic E coli (Hall et a11985) , but the bacteria were not E coli (S102-9). The nature of the adherent bacteria in the other seven calves is unknown, and their role in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea is unclear. It is possible that, because they always occurred in association with other enteropathogens, their presence was the result of an altered bacterial flora, following diarrhoea caused by another enteropathogen, or by the use of antibiotics. Alternatively, they may have contributed to the pathogenesis of diarrhoea by colonising the mucosal surface of the large intestine, causing lesions and inhibiting absorptive function. The lesions with which they were associated were identical in nature to those seen in the four calves infected by the confirmed enteropathogen E coli (S102-9) , although the severity was variable; this suggests a pathogenic role for these unidentified bacteria which may be confirmed by isolation and identification of the bacteria involved and studies of experimental infections.",
