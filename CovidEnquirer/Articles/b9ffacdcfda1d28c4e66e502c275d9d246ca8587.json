The first patient in this familial cluster was identified in presymptomatic period, as a close contact of a confirmed patient. Five family members had close contact with the first patient during his incubation period, four of them were confirmed to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the subsequent sampling test. Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; incubation period; cluster; COVID-19An emerging infectious disease, 2019 novel coronavirus disease, was identified to be associated with a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was initially reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China[1].",

Zhoushan CDC responded immediately and put the person A's family members (person B, C, D, E, F in Zhoushan City) concentrated at an isolation site and collected their throat swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing. On 9 February 2020, Zhoushan CDC identified four laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among person A's family members, and one of whom remained asymptomatic throughout the isolation period. Detailed epidemiological investigations are reported below. Timeline of exposure to the asymptomatic carrier of the SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 in a familial cluster seen in figure. Person A is a 51-year-old man who is the first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in this familial cluster. On January 26, he drove back to Wuxi city alone from his hometown in Hunan province, and then lived with his relatives from January 26 to January 28. Since the person A returned from Hunan province, he was managed for quarantine 14 days at home by the community organization on January 29. However, residential segregation in the community was not mandatory at the time. On January 31, he drove back to his home in Zhoushan city alone and lived together with his families for 4 days. On February 3, he drove back to Wuxi city alone, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f then he lived alone at home and did not go out. On February 4, his relative who had previously (January 26 to January 28) lived with him were detected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. On February 5, as the close contact, he was transferred to the isolation site and his throat swab samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection. On February 6, he was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR (Ct values were not available), but he did not has any symptoms as described previously at the time [5]. Then, he was transported to local infectious diseases hospital for isolation. On February 7, he developed fever and chest CT showed slight ground glass changes. From January 31 to February 3, Person A lived together with his father-in-law (Person B), mother-in-law (Person C), wife (Person F), wife's sister (Person D), daughter (Person E). On 9 February 2020, as the close contacts of Person A, the staff of Zhoushan CDC collected their throat swab samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection and four of them were positive (Person B, C, D, E) (Ct values shown in table). They had no contact with people who with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan or other areas with persistent local COVID-19 transmission in the 14 days prior to the onset of the disease, and no history of contact with wild animals or poultry. Person B had no clinical symptoms, but chest CT showed mild ground glass changes in the both lungs at the time of confirmed. Person C and D had slight symptom with cough, and chest CT J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 showed mild ground glass changes in the lung at the time of confirmed.",
