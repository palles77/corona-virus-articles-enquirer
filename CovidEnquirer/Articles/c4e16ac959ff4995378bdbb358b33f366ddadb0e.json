Cumulative ATG doses of 2 to 5 mg/kg produced a T-cell depletion of 1 log in the peripheral blood and 50% in the lymph nodes. Serum levels of ATG peaked on days 4 to 6 after initiation of therapy and became undetectable by day 13 as a result of canine antibody responses to ATG. ATG prolonged allogeneic skin graft survival to 14 days (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 5), compared with 8 days in control dogs (P \u202b\u060d\u202c .0003). Five dogs were given marrow transplants after ATG (3.5-5 mg/kg) and 1 Gy of TBI. Posttransplantation immunosuppression consisted of mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. All dogs showed initial engraftment, with maximum donor chimerism levels of 25%. However, only 1 dog achieved sustained engraftment, and 4 rejected their grafts. The duration of engraftment ranged from 8 to >36 weeks (median, 11 weeks), and this is comparable to that in 6 historical controls not given ATG (range, 3-12 weeks; median, 10 weeks; P \u202b\u060d\u202c .20). The total nucleated cell doses in the marrow grafts had the highest correlation coefficient with the duration of engraftment: 0.82 (P \u202b\u060d\u202c .09). We concluded that administering ATG before an otherwise suboptimal conditioning dose of 1 Gy of TBI failed to secure uniform stable hematopoietic engraftment.",

Assuming, next, a reduction of host T cells by rabbit ATG of 50%, the combination of pretransplantation ATG and 1 Gy of TBI should result in an estimated residual host T-cell population of approximately 17%. Thus, ATG plus 1 Gy of TBI fell short of the 10% residual host T cells estimated for 2 Gy of TBI, which permitted sustained engraftment in 11 of 12 dogs studied. It was not clear why 1 of the 5 dogs showed sustained engraftment, although a possible explanation might be fortuitous matching for a more important minor histocompatibility locus.

Dogs in the present study were exposed to ATG for the first time; however, they mounted secondary immune responses. To reconcile these 2 facts, we propose the following explanation: as shown, ATG contained rabbit antibodies that crossreacted with canine IgG. IgG is also found in membrane-bound form in the B-cell antigen receptor (mIgG-BCR). It is possible that ATG cross-reacted with the mIgG-BCR and triggered B cells through this very effective signaling pathway, leading to their activation and proliferation and to efficient production of IgG antibodies [33] , which, in turn, might have ATG complementarities and might lead to neutralization and clearance of ATG.",
