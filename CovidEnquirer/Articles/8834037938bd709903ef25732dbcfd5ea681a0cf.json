The present study proposed and established a detailed induction and assessment protocol for a unique and cost-effective preclinical steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) in rats with pulsed injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and methylprednisolone (MPS). Methods: Sixteen 24-week-old male SpragueeDawley rats were used to induce SAON by one intravenous injection of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) and three intraperitoneal injections of MPS (100 mg/kg) with a time interval of 24 hour, and then, MPS (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected three times a week from week 2 until sacrifice. Additional 12 rats were used as normal controls. Two and six weeks after induction, animals were scanned by metabolic dual energy Xray absorptiometry for evaluation of tissue composition; serum was collected for bone turnover markers, Microfil perfusion was performed for angiography, the liver was collected for histopathology and bilateral femora and bilateral tibiae were collected for histological examination. Results: Three rats died after LPS injection, i.e., with 15.8% (3/19) mortality. Histological evaluation showed 100% incidence of SAON at week 2. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed significantly higher fat percent and lower lean mass in SAON group at week 6. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) showed significant bone degradation at proximal tibia 6 weeks after SAON induction. Angiography illustrated significantly less blood vessels in the Journal of Orthopaedic Translation (2018) 13, 13e24 proximal tibia and significantly more leakage particles in the distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. Serum amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen and osteocalcin were significantly lower at both 2 and 6 weeks after SAON induction, and serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide was significantly lower at 6 weeks after SAON induction. Histomorphometry revealed significantly lower osteoblast surface and higher marrow fat fraction and oedema area in SAON group. Hepatic oedema appeared 2 weeks after SAON induction, and lipid accumulation appeared in the liver of SAON rats 6 weeks after SAON induction. Conclusion: The present study successfully induced SAON in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS, which was well simulating the clinical feature and pathology. Apart from available large animal models, such as bipedal emus or quadrupedal rabbits, our current SAON small model in rats could be a cost-effective preclinical experimental model to study body metabolism, molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention or treatment of SAON. The translational potential of this article: The present study successfully induced SAON in a small animal model in rats with pulsed injection of LPS and MPS. The evaluation protocols with typical histopathologic ON features and advanced evaluation approaches to identify the metabolic disorders of SAON could be used in future rat SAON studies. The SAON rat model is a suitable and cost-effective animal model to study molecular mechanism of SAON and potential drugs developed for prevention and treatment of SAON.",

For studying molecular mechanism of such metabolic diseases and drug prevention or treatment effects, rats are more suitable as they have been regarded as cost-effective animal models. So far, there are several reports on SAON rat models, but the protocols to induce SAON are different [4e8] . LPS could increase the incidence of SAON in animal models [5] . The dose of LPS in the published protocols ranged from 10 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg to induce SAON in rats [8, 9] . The dose of LPS used in the rabbit SAON model is 10 mg/kg [3] , but because rats are resistant to LPS, whereas rabbits are sensitive to LPS [10] , we should use higher dose of LPS to induce SAON in the rat model than that used in the rabbit model. A preliminary study showed that the injection of 1 mg/kg LPS could induce 50% mortality in 24-week-old male SpragueeDawley rats [11] ; therefore, in this study, we tested the dose of LPS at 0.2 mg/kg that might reduce the mortality. In a clinical situation, high dose of pulsed MPS intravascularly (30 mg/kg) is prescribed to severe inflammation patients to rescue their life [12] . As smaller animals have higher metabolic rates and require larger drug dose per body weight, we calculated dose conversion between rat and human being by multiple clinical higher dose based on a published work [13] . To mimic the clinical situation, we tested the experimental protocol to induce SAON in rats with a single injection of high dose of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) and followed subsequently by pulsed injections of high dose of MPS (100 mg/kg). As SAON may get repaired spontaneously in quadrupedal animals, it is essential to inhibit repairing of the osteonecrosis. Accordingly, we continually gave rats sustained low dose of MPS (40 mg/kg) from week 2 to week 6 before harvesting specimens for analysis. For determining the age of rats used in this study, unlike humans and rabbits, it is problematic to determine adulthood using skeletal maturity because there is no closed growth plate in long bones in rats. For SpragueeDawley rats, the skeletal growth tapers off at approximately 7e8 months [14] ; therefore, we used 24week-old young adult rats for the present study as this was the age where rat femoral head matured [15] .",

Accordingly, we evaluated the induction protocol at two time points, i.e., 2 and 6 weeks after SAON induction. We used different evaluation approaches to examine the effects of LPS and MPS in inducing metabolic disorders on the bone and other affected tissues. Histological examination was used to identify osteonecrotic lesions in bilateral femora and bilateral tibiae. Metabolic dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) was used for evaluation of tissue composition, i.e., fat and lean composition, to evaluate the effects of corticosteroid on fat and muscle metabolism. Serum bone turnover markers were quantified for determining the dynamics of bone turnover in this corticosteroid-affected metabolic bone disorder. Angiography in bone marrow was imaged and evaluated by Microfil perfusion and micro-CT to define the vessel changes. Liver histopathology was used to identify the metabolic disorders in the liver. Establishing and validating preclinical disease models are essential for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and testing prevention and/or treatment concept(s) with targeted mechanisms.",

The endpoint evaluation is the ON incidence evaluated by histology, which is a gold standard to evaluate ON in an animal model [24] . We observed typical ON lesions in our histological slides for proximal and distal femur and proximal and distal tibia, with similar histopathological ON features seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients who received large dose of corticosteroid with SAON developed at multiple skeletal sites, including hip, knee and ankle joint [26] . We found 100% ON incidence at week 2 attributed to combined effects of LPS and large dose of pulsed MPS treatment. Corticosteroid-induced ON was through its direct effects on bone cells to induce the apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes so as to impair bone formation [27, 28] . LPS-induced inflammation could inhibit bone formation and increase bone resorption, which simulated the inflammation deceases [29, 30] . In this study, the Ob. S/BS was significantly lower at the time point of week 2, suggesting that the LPS and excess corticosteroid induced cell death with reduced osteoblast number. Correspondingly, the bone formation marker PINP was significantly lower, which suggested that the total bone formation function is inhibited and accompanied downregulation of another bone formation marker OC at week 2. OC is secreted by the osteoblast and is a marker of the activity of osteoblasts' activity of the entire skeleton within the body [31] ; it is also a bone-regulated endocrine hormone to regulate energy metabolism [31] . The significantly decreased OC could induce abnormal glucose and adipose metabolism [32, 33] . Our results showed that the bone marrow fat in the SAON group was significantly larger than that in the normal control group, which could decrease the blood supply in the bone marrow region. OC could also stimulate angiogenesis [34] . Corticosteroid has antiangiogenesis effect [35] , which consequently impairs blood supply. Our Microfil and angiography results showed that the volume of blood vessels in red bone marrow region of the proximal tibia of the SAON group was significantly lower than that in the normal control group, evidence of impaired blood supply in bone marrow, and consequently the induced hypoxia would eventually cause osteonecrosis. Oedema was appeared at bone marrow at week 2 after SAON induction. It was reported that LPS-induced inflammation could induce vascular dysfunction and blood vessel leakage [36] . Our Microfil and angiography results also showed more leakage particles in the distal tibia 2 weeks after SAON induction. More leakage particles found in the present study suggested higher vessel permeability that could induce oedema, and Figure 7 Serum markers. Bone turnover markers: serum PINP and OC in the SAON group were significantly lower at week 2 and week 6 than those in the normal group; serum CTX in the SAON group was significantly lower at week 6 than that in the normal group at the same time point and than that at week 2 in the SAON group. (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, n Z 6). CTX Z carboxy-terminal telopeptide; OC Z osteocalcin; PINP Z amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen; SAON Z steroidassociated osteonecrosis. higher marrow pressure, in turn, reduced blood flow and induced hypoxia. The LPS-induced blood vessel leakage further induced oedema, then inhibited the blood vessel function and then hypoxia, which eventually induce osteonecrosis. VEGF expression was higher in the SAON group in both proximal and distal tibia, indicating severe ischaemia and hypoxia condition in the SAON group after induction.",

At the beginning of the repair progress at week 2, bone histomorphometry evaluated in the proximal tibia showed significantly lower Ob. S/BS and higher osteoclast number in the SAON group, suggesting significant bone loss after induction. Bone resorption marker CTX in the SAON group and normal group were however not significantly different, whereas the bone formation marker PINP and OC in the SAON group were both significantly lower than those in the normal group, suggesting systemic bone loss under the influence of LPS and MPS induction. At week 6, because of the continuous steroid treatment and the continuous bone loss, both bone formation markers and bone resorption marker were lower for the SAON group than those in the normal group. Bone histomorphometry revealed that the Ob. S/BS correspondingly showed lower osteoblast number in the SAON group at week 6, which demonstrated the continuous inhibiting effect of the steroid. Severe fat accumulation was found in red marrow region, and more oedema persisted in yellow marrow region at week 6 than those at week 2 in SAON group, suggesting poor blood supply at week 6 when compared with that at week 2, although at week 6, there were only two rats in the SAON group classified as ON\u00c0, which was explained by on-going repairing progress and the significant bone loss especially in red marrow region of ROIs evaluated at proximal femur, distal femur and proximal tibia.",

The ROI was chosen at the low limb because the fat percent in the normal control group was low, i.e., 1.5% from the result that provided reference data to study their alterations in the SAON group. There is muscleebone crosstalk that they may modulate each other mechanically and metabolically [38] , especially in the metabolic syndrome affected by excess corticosteroid [39] . Inflammation, oxidative stress and hormonal modification could be the common causes involved in development of decreased muscle mass and decreased osteoblast activity [38] . In our SAON rat model, we found significantly lower lean mass from DXA results and lower bone mass from micro-CT at week 6 that shared similar clinical features [39] . DXA results in this study also showed significantly increased fat percentage in the lower limb in the SAON group at week 6, whereas the body weight for rats from the SAON group did not increase from week 2 to week 6, suggesting that corticosteroid treatment changed the tissue composition, i.e., increased fat tissue and decreased bone and skeletal muscle, but not body weight in this rat SAON model. The excess corticosteroid treatment could affect differentiation potential of both adipocytes and osteoblasts by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) of the precursor cells of adipocytes and osteoblasts to increase adipogenesis and meanwhile decrease osteogenesis to induce osteonecrosis [40, 41] .",
