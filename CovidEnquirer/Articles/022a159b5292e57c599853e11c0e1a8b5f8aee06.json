            "text": "The impact of the recent financial crisis has highlighted the importance of the financial sector to the global economy, playing an important part in many of the world's large economies. For example, the US is said to have the largest and most sophisticated financial services sector in the world (Nolan, Shippey, Woznick, & Hinkelman, 1995) , financial services contributed approximately 8% of Australian GDP in 2003 1 , and 26.8% of GDP for Hong Kong in 2009, 2 The UK economy, which is used in this application to illustrate the potential impacts to 'similar' economies has a financial sector contributing 8% to total GDP 3 With respect to pandemic preparedness, this raises a specific policy question concerning the extent to which this sector may be affected by a pandemic, and the likely policies to mitigate the pandemic's effects. The limited work thus far on the wider macroeconomic impact of pandemic influenza, alluded to above, has considered different aspects of an influenza pandemic but, in each case, the financial sector has been aggregated together with other service industries and sectors. As a result, little can be said about the sectoral impact of a pandemic over the results for the aggregated economic effect. The work presented here therefore focuses on assessing the macroeconomic impact of an influenza pandemic on a single country economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, which allows for a disaggregated finance sector, as outlined in the sector listing in the Appendix, to generate greater specificity in analysis. Application of this model to multiple countries is possible, as the model specification would not differ if applied to different countries with large financial sectors. Although the underlying database would differ between countries, as would some model parameters such as elasticities, the results should be seen as reasonably comparable across \"similar\" countries. We therefore present the results from a model of the UK, but suggest that these results are indicative for other nations also.",

The resultant 12 sectors (elaborated in the Appendix) are: Although the model is a single-country model, it is an openeconomy model, meaning that foreign trade is captured through import and export functions. The differences between origins are encapsulated as follows. Domestically produced commodities are sold both in the domestic market and abroad. Sales abroad take the form of exports and are modelled using a Constant Elasticity of Transformation function. Domestic sales originate from domestic and foreign sources (imports) and this is modelled using a composite commodity and Armington assumption which determines the combination of domestically produced commodities and imports by means of a constant elasticity of substitution. Composite commodities can then be used as an input into the production process of the domestically produced commodities or sold for final consumption by households, government or investment.

In the UK (and many other countries), there were three distinct waves of the 1918 pandemic, each lasting 10e15 weeks (Ministry of Health, 1920) with the largest occurring in the autumn of 1918. In the autumn of 1957 a single wave pandemic occurred of about 15 weeks duration (Ministry Of Health, 1960) . In 1968/69 a two-wave pandemic affected the UK resulting in a small first wave in March 1969, and a main wave in midwinter of 1969/70 (Cooper, Pitman, Edmunds, & Gay, 2006) . Based on information from these previous pandemics, time series simulations were conducted to represent influenza mortality by age and over time for three different severities of pandemic (Kramer, 2007) ; these severities are referred to as mild (CFR \u00bc 0.06%), moderate (CFR \u00bc 0.18%) and severe (CFR \u00bc 0.35%). Note that the scenarios include allowance for a limited stock of antivirals to be made available to key workers, as this is part of the UK preparedness response; the impact of wider use of antivirals for the general public is considered in the sensitivity analysis.

Because the precise nature of any future influenza pandemic is unknown, understanding the risk is best achieved by creating a representative set of plausible events. Here an 'event set' approach was used, consisting of a number of randomly generated simulations of the level of excess mortality (Kramer, 2007) . Each of the events comprised within the set is defined by variables that are generated using distributions that reflect historical evidence. These variables include, for example, the ability of a virus to spread (R 0 ), the likelihood that an infected person will die (lethality), and the probability that antivirals will to some degree be effective in reducing the impact of a new virus. Simulations then allow the probability that any particular severity is exceeded to be established. This allows mortality severities per pandemic influenza event to be related to the annual likelihood of such an event.",

Limited economic modelling (Balicer, Huerta et al., 2005) suggests that pre-pandemic stockpiling of antiviral drugs can be cost-saving and that it would be cost-beneficial and cost effective to adopt strategies for their use in treating patients and possibly for short-term post exposure prophylaxis of close contacts of people who are infected. However, their effectiveness against a wide range of potential viruses is not fully understood. Antivirals were found to be reasonably effective in the recent swine flu pandemic, but their efficacy for future strains is unknown. The model therefore assumes that antivirals would not work at all e whether used for treatment or prophylaxis e in one in four simulated pandemics. Antiviral treatment is assumed to reduce infectiousness, as well as sickness and mortality. It will therefore slow the spread of the simulated pandemic and reduce death rates. Every person receiving antivirals is assumed to get them within 48 h of becoming sick. However, because this requirement is likely to be challenging even for the best of healthcare systems, it is assumed to be achieved in only 65% of people who become ill.",

Pandemic influenza plans (DoH, 2007; DoH & HPIH&SD, 2005) suggest that absence from work for infected individuals will vary from 5 to 10 days. The most severe pandemics (those with highest fatality) are assumed to result in a longer duration of illness for those that survive. Based on the severity of the pandemics, the mild scenario will result in 5 days of absence from work for infected individuals whilst the moderate scenario will result in 7 days of absence and the severe scenario will result in 10 days of absence. As suggested (DoH, 2007; DoH & HPIH&SD, 2005; HPA, 2006) , a 35% clinical attack rate for each pandemic is assumed, i.e. 35% of the population would be infected. These scenarios, together with their impact on the working population, are shown in Table 1 . The clinical attack rate for pandemic influenza is unknown, so scenarios were run as tabulated in Table 2 with a 25% and 50% clinical attack rate (CAR) to allow for variability (the CARs referred to are slightly mitigated by school closures in some scenarios and the specifics of this mitigation are outlined later).",

We assume that this school closure will mitigate the pandemic in the proportion described in (Ferguson et al., 2006) where a 34% CAR was estimated to reduce by 2% due to school closure. Analysis of the Labour Force Survey (2005) suggests that there are a total of 25,245,000 individuals aged 16e64 who are in paid employment in the UK. Of these 3,900,000 are women who are either the head of the household or the spouse of, or cohabiting with, the head of the household and have dependent children in the household aged under 16 years. That is, 15.5% of the workforce comprises women who are probably responsible for dependent children (Sadique et al., 2007) . However, other research suggests that 54% of parents have access to informal care arrangements for their children (Sadique, Adams, and Edmunds, 2008) and we use this estimate to mitigate the absences resulting from school closure.",

Such absenteeism is likely to be limited in its duration. (DoH, 2007) suggests that most worker absence will occur during a 2e3 week period and it may be reasonably assumed that this is the time period that is most likely to provoke prophylactic absence and worker fear. It also agrees with the assumed duration of school closures and is therefore used as our estimate of prophylactic absence duration. Amongst other issues, prophylactic absenteeism in the event of a major pandemic was surveyed in (Sadique et al., 2007) . The results of this survey state that 34% of workers would take prophylactic absenteeism in the event of an influenza pandemic, of which 3.75% were women who had children at school and would therefore overlap with the school closure absenteeism. However, the remaining 30.25% represent the additional shock due to prophylactic absenteeism. It should be highlighted that there is some uncertainty as to whether individuals who state a willingness to take prophylactic absenteeism would, in reality, carry out this intention, so this shock should be seen as a 'best guess' estimate which may be higher or lower in reality. Evidence to suggest a mitigation effect of school closure has already been outlined, but such mitigation is not assumed in response to prophylactic absence. (Ferguson, et al., 2006) suggests that transmission rates in the workplace are similar to those in the home. A very small (1%) Fig. 4 . Exports by sector. Fig. 5 . Imports by sector. Fig. 6 .

Interestingly, together with the retail, hotels and restaurant sector (RHR) and transport and telecommunications sector (T_T), these sectors also experience the greatest differential in impact between the situation concerning disease only, versus those with school closure, prophylactic absenteeism or all combined. This may reflect the more essential physical presence of workers in the manufacturing process, or the service sector, than elsewhere and less scope for capital substitution or virtual working (e.g. within financial sector).

Specifically, compared with BII, OBS generates smaller losses to household consumption, investment and government consumption, but large export losses. This impact is reasonable since the industry is heavily reliant on labour supply and many of the industries that make up this sector, such as real estate activities, are unlikely to be in great demand during an influenza pandemic. This is supported also by this sector, compared with BII, showing less differential in impact when school closure or prophylactic absenteeism is added to the disease effect, where as BII is more influenced by these effects. With respect to BII, the impacts are certainly no more significant than on other sectors, exhibiting losses of up to 1.5% in domestic output (Fig. 2) , up to 2% to household consumption (Fig. 3) , 3% to exports (Fig. 4) , 2.5% to imports (Fig. 5) , about 1.4% to investment and about 2% to government consumption (Figs. 6 and 7) .

Further, the rapidity of the impact that will strike the financial sector may influence the overall effect and is an area that requires further consideration in future developments of the model which, at present, takes an annual average rather than accounting for the transitional effects of the time period and duration of the outbreak. For instance, the shock in a small location such as financial heart of a country may last only 6e8 weeks, compared with 15 weeks for the country overall (DoH, 2007) . In this case, absenteeism, for instance, from illness would result in a reduction in labour supply that is much more acute, but shorter lived, than currently estimated based on the yearly average.",

This is in agreement with the study by Ferguson, but there is a shortage of evidence to inform these assumptions and it is therefore quite possible that the economic impact due to this may be overemphasised. Parameter estimates of the school closure and prophylactic absence were also required but, in reality, the precautionary behaviour that will be used is quite unpredictable. Nonetheless, the sensitivity analysis goes some way towards illustrating the changes in effect that are yielded by these variations in behaviour and results were quite sensitive to the large variations in prophylactic absence modelled in our sensitivity analysis. Also, the use and effectiveness of antivirals in the CGE model are dictated by the assumptions of the model outlined in (Kramer, 2007) and are therefore subject to the same limitations as that study.",

It is also possible, of course, that key workers may be moved geographically, or other polices put in place in corporate preparedness plans.",

For instance, it appears robust that antivirals will be largely ineffective and that the likely prophylactic absenteeism by workers will be most harmful to the economy. The importance of the financial sector to the large economies of the world is such that further analysis would appear to be beneficial, especially if it were to account for the epidemiological effects of mitigation policies and the possibility of financial organisations shifting business to foreign branches during the pandemic peak and undertaking additional work when the pandemic strikes elsewhere. Further development of the modelling approach undertaken here together with exploration of the likely wider effects and how to parameterize these is therefore recommended. In the light of the current financial crisis, centered on the banking sector, we have in fact seen some of the ways in which any adverse impacts on that sector affect the entire UK economy. In that context it is advisable to consider the extreme vulnerability of an already compromised financial sector to the impact of a deadly respiratory disease prior to the recovery e if any e of that sector and the UK economy; a recovery which might take a decade or more.
