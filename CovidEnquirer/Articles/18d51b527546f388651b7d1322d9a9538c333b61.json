Although broadly reactive antibodies against these antigens could be useful as therapeutics and in vaccine design, their identification has proven elusive. Here, we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that recognize erythrocytes infected by different P. falciparum isolates and opsonize these cells by binding to members of the RIFIN family. These antibodies acquired broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large DNA fragment between the V and DJ segments.",

In both donors, the core of the inserts encoded an amino acid sequence that was 85-96% homologous to the extracellular domain of LAIR-1, a collagen-binding inhibitory receptor encoded in the leukocyte receptor locus on chromosome 19 (Chr19) 6 . However, in each donor, the broadly reactive antibodies used a distinct VH/JH combination (VH3-7/JH6 in donor C and VH4-4/JH6 in donor D) and had junctions of distinct length between the V, LAIR-1 and J segments. In addition, the broadly reactive antibodies from donor D shared a single light (L) chain (VK1-8/JK5), while the antibodies from donor C had one of three different L chains (VK1-5/JK2, VK4-1/JK2, VL7-43/JL3) (Extended Data Fig. 4 ). All the broadly reactive antibodies carried a high load of somatic mutations spanning the whole V-LAIR-1-DJ region. The mutations in the VH were used to reconstruct genealogy trees showing a developmental pathway with progressive acquisition of somatic mutations (Fig.  2b-c) . Notably, the trees were consistent with those generated using only the LAIR-1 insert or the VL sequence (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). These findings indicate that, within each Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts individual, a single B cell clone carrying a LAIR-1 insert expanded following stimulation by malaria antigens and progressively accrued mutations in the LAIR-1, VH and VL regions.",

In particular, in donor C, the insert comprised not only the 294 bp exon encoding the extracellular LAIR-1 domain, but also a 190 bp 5' intronic region of the LAIR-1 gene that was partially spliced out in the mRNA, and a shorter 23 bp 3' intronic region that was maintained in the mRNA (Extended Data Fig.  6a) .

As RAG acts by excising a target DNA sequence, we investigated whether, in B cells making LAIR-1-containing antibodies, one of the two LAIR-1 alleles on Chr19 would be deleted. By sequencing genomic DNA from T cells of donor C, we identified a heterozygous nucleotide site in the Chr19 LAIR-1 exon sequence.

Substitution of the V, J or L chain of MGD21 with that of an unrelated antibody did not affect binding to IE (Fig. 3b) , suggesting that these elements are dispensable for binding. In contrast, deletion of the LAIR-1 insert, or its reversion to the unmutated genomic sequence, led to a complete loss of binding. Furthermore, fusion proteins displaying only the mutated LAIR-1 exon bound to IE, although with lower affinity. To dissect the contribution of the somatic mutations of the LAIR-1 insert to antigen binding, we created a set of LAIR-1-Fc fusion proteins carrying, in various combinations, the mutations shared by MGD21 with other antibodies of the same clonal family. We tested the mutants for binding to IE and to collagen, which is the natural ligand of LAIR-1. Interestingly, two distinct kinds of mutations were identified: those that reduced collagen binding (P106S and P107R) and those that increased binding to IE (T67L, N69S and A77T) (Fig. 3c) . Collectively, these findings indicate that the binding of the broadly reactive antibodies to IE relies mainly on the mutated LAIR-1 domain, which evolves under selective pressure to lose collagen binding and gain binding to IE.",

In addition, when tested in a rosette inhibition assay with O + or A + erythrocytes, MGD21 did not show a consistent inhibitory effect (P > 0.1 for both blood groups) (Extended Data Fig. 9j ). In contrast, MGD21, as well as MGC34, could agglutinate erythrocytes infected with 3D7 or the Kenyan isolate 11019 (Extended Data Fig. 9k ). Furthermore, MGD21 showed a strong capacity to opsonize 3D7 IE for phagocytosis by human monocytes (Fig. 4d ). Opsonization was dependent on an intact Fc, as a mutant lacking Fc receptor binding (MGD21 LALA) did not induce phagocytosis. Similar results were obtained with other broadly reactive antibodies isolated from both donors and with a different parasite isolate (11019) (Extended Data Fig.  9l ), suggesting that these broadly reactive antibodies could be effective in promoting phagocytosis and destruction of IE in vivo. Our study opens several questions as to the potential use of RIFINs as targets for passive and active vaccination. RIFINs represent the largest family (~150 genes) of variant antigens expressed on IE, some of which have been implicated in severe malaria 3 . The LAIR-1containing antibodies have potent agglutinating and opsonizing activity, which would be consistent with their role in decreasing the burden of IE in vivo by enhancing parasite clearance. However, the staining of only a fraction of IE by the LAIR-1-containing antibodies is consistent with the clonal expression of RIFINs 3 and suggests that these antibodies may not be sufficient to take full control of the infection. It will be interesting to determine whether the LAIR-1-containing antibodies recognize RIFINs that are expressed at other stages of the parasite life cycle, such as sporozoites, merozoites and gametocytes 7, 8 , which may open interesting opportunities for vaccine design.",

The precise location of the LAIR-1 and Chr13 inserts between the V and D/J segments, as well as the presence of N-nucleotides and cryptic 12/23 RSSs at the ends of the inserts, would be compatible with a role for the RAG enzyme. RAG has been implicated in inter-chromosomal genomic rearrangements at cryptic RSSs outside the Ig and TCR loci 9,10 , and in the formation of chromosomal translocations found in human lymphomas 11, 12 . However, RSSs are frequently found in the genome and are generally inactive, according to recent data 13, 14 . Furthermore, the conservation of the two LAIR-1 alleles in B cells producing LAIR-1-containing antibodies is inconsistent with a RAGmediated \"cut-and-paste\" mechanism and suggests a new mechanism by which LAIR-1 DNA is duplicated. It is possible that gene conversion 15 or AID-dependent genomic instability caused by chronic Plasmodium infection 16 may contribute to the production of LAIR-1-containing antibodies. AID can lead to insertions and deletions of multiple codons in the V-genes, which contribute to the specificity of the antibody in the context of the whole V-gene 17, 18 . Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, these insertions are distributed over the whole V-gene sequence, are of smaller size and cannot be traced back to a particular genomic sequence as in the case of LAIR-1.",

The stained parasites were washed five times, mixed in equal proportions, and diluted to a 5% haematocrit in incomplete RPMI medium. Ten \u03bcL of the parasite mixture was rotated with 2.5 \u03bcL of adult plasma for 1.5 h at room temperature, and agglutinates formed were examined by fluorescence microscopy. In the primary screen, pools of five adult plasma were tested against six Kenyan isolates (in two separate reactions). Pools that formed mixed-color agglutinates were identified and individual plasma within these pools were tested against nine isolates using the same assay. A single isolate (10668) was not detected in mixed agglutinates formed by any of the plasma and was therefore excluded from the study. Two adults (donors C and D) with plasma that formed mixed agglutinates with eight parasite isolates were selected for monoclonal antibody isolation and, following further informed consent, an additional blood sample was taken from each individual in February 2014.",
