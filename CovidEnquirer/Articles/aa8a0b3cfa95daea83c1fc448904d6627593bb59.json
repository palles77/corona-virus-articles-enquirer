retrospective cohort study was carried out in the intensive care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) and King Abdullah Children's Specialist Hospital (KACSH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The analysis includes data from medical records of all patients admitted to ICUs who received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. For each patient, potential risk factors were collected. The main outcome of this study was the mortality during the stay in ICU after receiving mechanical ventilation Results: A total of 262 adults and 175 pediatric patients were admitted to ICUs and received mechanical ventilation during the study period. For adult patients, the overall mortality was 37%, with a median survival time of 11 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-20 days). The main risk factors independently associated with the increased mortality rate were being aged 51-60 (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-1.0) and factors related to ICU admission. For the pediatric population, the mortality rate was 17%, with a median survival time of 16 days (IQR 7-37 days)",

            "text": "M echanical ventilation is considered an important aspect of the supportive management of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Many studies have reported an increased rate of using mechanical ventilation over the last 7 years. This increase is attributable to increases in demand for acute and critical care delivery in many health care systems. This demand is being caused by an increasingly aging population, an increase in the survival of patients with comorbidity and cancer, an increase in the number of ICU beds, and the advancements in therapy management. [1] [2] [3] Thus, many observational studies have examined the use of mechanical ventilation and its associated outcomes, some of which have focused on estimating the mortality rate and identifying the factors related to the survival of patients who received mechanical ventilation. [4] [5] [6] [7] Data on the survival of patients admitted to ICUs and requiring mechanical ventilation, therefore, are varied. The variability in survival data reflects differences in ICU patients' selection criteria, patient care standards, and the characteristics of the population. In 2002, Esteban et al 8 evaluated the outcomes of adult patients admitted to ICUs and showed that the overall mortality rate was 52% among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Another study by the same research group showed that crude mortality rate in ICUs had been decreased in 2010 compared to that in 1998 (31% versus 28%). 9 This improvement was related to the improvement in clinical practices over the period. Additionally, studies have reported that many factors related to the initiation of mechanical ventilation as well as other factors related to the management plan and complication during the course of mechanical ventilation affect the survival of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. 8, 10 In Saudi Arabia, many studies have examined the mortality outcome of patients admitted to ICUs; however, some of those studies have evaluated the outcome of patients receiving mechanical ventilation for specific indications, such as with severe respiratory conditions, 11, 12 or have focused on a specific population such as that with a hematological malignancy. [11] [12] [13] [14] However, the survival of patients admitted to an ICU and received mechanical ventilation with various indications and among heterogenous population has not been reported in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study; therefore, was to estimate the survival of adult and pediatric patients admitted to ICU and received mechanical ventilation, and to determine the associated factors influencing the survival. The results of this study will help in identifying patients at risk and planning appropriate preventive measures.",

            "text": "Discussion. The results of this study showed that the mortality rate of adult patients who required mechanical ventilation was 37% and that of the pediatric population was 17%. Elderly patients and those with circulatory system disease and infection as admission cause to ICU have higher mortality rate after 11, [17] [18] [19] [20] These studies provide valuable information on the epidemiology of mechanical ventilation and address the outcome of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. 8, 9 The finding of this study pertaining to the mortality rate among the adult population is consistent with the findings from earlier studies. 8 Previous studies carried out in developed countries have shown an overall mortality rate of 30-44% among their population, while this reaches 70% in countries with a low-resource setting. 8, 21 A prospective cohort study including 15,757 patients estimated that the all-cause mortality was 52% in patients who received mechanical ventilation because of ARDS, while this was 22% in patients with COPD. 8 The authors of that study estimated 40% as the mortality of patients receiving mechanical ventilation, while in our study we report 37% as the overall mortality. On the other hand, multicenter international studies have reported that short-term mortality has decreased among mechanically ventilated patients over time. 9 However, the finding in this study concerning mortality in adult patients was higher than in another study that examined the trend of using mechanical ventilation over 10 years, from 1998 to 2010, during which the mortality rate declined by 28%. 9 Thus, in the published research, many studies have reported that age is an independent factor associated with mortality. 8 Those studies have shown an effect of age on the mortality of patients who received mechanical ventilation, whereby they reported that age has an independent effect on the outcomes of those patients. Our data showed a higher percentage of patients who died after the initiation of mechanical ventilation in the 3 age categories 51-60, 61-70, and more than 71 years old. Also, the results of this study showed that the percentage of patients who were overweight was higher compared to the percentage of patients who died after the initiation of mechanical ventilation in the same category. This finding supports the concept of the obesity paradox, whereby many studies have indicated that obesity and morbid obesity are associated with a lower mortality rate in patients with ARDS. 22 However, this was not significant in the univariate analysis In addition, we were able to examine mortality among the pediatric population. Therefore, extreme prematurity was associated with a low survival rate, which is consistent with previous studies that examined the outcome of prematurity. 23, 24 As reported in many studies, 23, 24 we found that a higher percentage of patients who received mechanical ventilation were male; however, they were similar to females in terms of Additionally, in the current study the majority of the pediatric population was within one month of age, thus this population is different from classic pediatric patients and this finding limits our generalizability of the results to the wider pediatric population. The published prospective studies examining the mortality of mechanically ventilated patients described the mortality and evaluated the effect of many comorbidity variables that potentially related to mortality. They found that the survival of ICU patients depends on factors that develop during the course of the ventilation in addition to those factors that cause the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Although this point is considered a limitation in the current study, as we did not collect such information, the main aim of this study was to estimate the survival of a heterogeneous group of patients who were admitted to the ICU and required mechanical ventilation at one center in Saudi Arabia. Thus at a national level, many studies have been carried out that estimated mortality as one of many outcomes of patients admitted to ICUs. 11 Thus, a limited number of studies has addressed this issue among patients with certain conditions such as malignancy or acute renal failure. 13, 25 An important consideration in our study was the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection that occurred during the study period. Thus, MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to ICUs was associated with high 12 The strengths of this study were, first, that the data were extracted from electronic records rather than handwritten to minimize errors in measurement; and second, that it addresses the mortality rate among both adult and pediatric ventilated patients without specifying conditions. Both KAMC and KACSH assign ICD-10 diagnosis codes for ICU admission diagnosis, whereby we adopt the same categories in the classification of the reason for ICU admission. Although this may be complex, re-grouping the principal diagnoses of ICU admission into mutually exclusive categories would impose further challenges as we may under-or overestimate the association of specific categories with others. On the other hand, one of the limitations of the study is related to the information concerning the severity of the patients: the APACHE II score, chronic use of corticosteroids, failure previous to mechanical ventilation, and other conditions occurring during mechanical ventilation were not studied. This study was observational in nature and the effect of many factors as well as unmeasured confounders cannot be fully controlled. However, we acknowledge that the presence of such information would be useful to give the full picture of our study population. Thus, based on previous studies, the severity of the disease and co-existing comorbidity are predictor factors associated with higher mortality among ICU patients. The small sample size in this study is considered one of the limitations of our analysis. Nevertheless, our purpose was to assess the overall mortality among mechanically ventilated patients who were admitted to the ICU in one center. A further retrospective multicenter study with appropriate statistical power and study design to include further confounders is essential to provide more realistic survival data on ICU patients in Saudi Arabia.",
