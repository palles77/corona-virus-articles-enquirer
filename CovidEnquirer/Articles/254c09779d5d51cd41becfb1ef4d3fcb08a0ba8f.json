Knowledge about CAM-mediated transmembrane signaling has medical implications because it will allow tailored design of therapeutic agents that can target specific CAMs. For a large number of CAMs, the molecular/biochemical properties are known in great detail, and crystal structures have been reported for many CAM ectodomains (Xiong et al., 2001; Boggon et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2002; Soroka et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2004; Fedarovich et al., 2006; Korotkova et al., 2008) . However, with the exception of some integrins (Kim et al., 2003; Takagi et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2004 ), this has not yet given satisfactory explanations for mechanisms of ectodomain-initiated signal generation. Signaling by singlepass CAMs belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily remains a mystery and requires additional information on the structural dynamics and supramolecular organization of native CAMs at the cell surface and how these properties are influenced by homophilic and heterophilic CAM interactions. To achieve this goal, x-ray crystallography has to be complemented by other methods that give information on individual molecules in large populations.",

In this investigation, we addressed the mechanism of signal generation by ectodomains of single-pass transmembrane homophilic CAMs. We analyzed the structure and homophilic interactions of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related CAM 1 (CEACAM1), which regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, morphogenesis, and microbial responses. Soluble and membrane-attached CEACAM1 ectodomains were investigated by surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor analysis, molecular electron tomography, and chemical cross-linking. The CEACAM1 ectodomain, which is composed of four glycosylated immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, is highly flexible and participates in both antiparallel (trans) and parallel (cis) homophilic binding. Membrane-attached CEACAM1 ectodomains form microclusters in which all four Ig domains participate. Trans-binding between the N-terminal Ig domains increases formation of CEACAM1 cis-dimers and changes CEACAM1 interactions within the microclusters. These data suggest that CEACAM1 transmembrane signaling is initiated by adhesion-regulated changes of cis-interactions that are transmitted to the inner phase of the plasma membrane.",

D(1-4) and D(2-4) CEACAM1 ectodomain Fc fusion proteins were immobilized as ligands on a BIAcore chip, and both His-tagged ( Fig. 1) and Fc fusion ectodomains (not depicted) were used as soluble analytes. The rat D(1-4) proteins bound specifically to immobilized rat D(1-4) ( Fig. 1 ) but not to rat D(2-4) (not depicted). No explicit binding of the rat D(2-4) constructs was observed either to rat D(1-4) or rat D(2-4) ligands (unpublished data). Thus, the recordable homophilic binding must be caused by D1-D1 interactions. The D(1-4) binding was characterized by rapid on and off rates in the presence of both EDTA and Ca/Mg, but the extent of binding was larger in Ca/Mg (Fig. 1 ). In addition, the divalent cations induced a more complex binding pattern, with a slower binding superimposed on the dominant rapid association/ dissociation, demonstrating that at least two different binding reactions occurred. The Ca/Mg effect was not influenced by the His tag because the same divalent cation dependence was seen when CEACAM1 Fc fusion proteins, which lack a His tag, were used as analytes (unpublished data).",

The two major isoforms, CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-4S, which differ only in their cytoplasmic domains, have ectodomains comprised of four glycosylated Ig domains. CEACAM1-induced cell signaling is regulated by its intercellular homophilic binding at the cell surface (Gray-Owen and Blumberg, 2006) , which is mediated by the N-terminal Ig domain (D1) in a reciprocal D1-D1 interaction (Wikstr\u00f6m et al., 1996; Watt et al., 2001) .

We found that the CEACAM1 ectodomain is highly flexible, participating in a limited set of structurally well-defined homophilic binding interactions that give rise to two different kinds of dimers as well as trimers and higher order oligomers. When the CEACAM1 ectodomain was associated with liposomal membranes, it became organized in multimeric microclusters with a narrow size distribution. Upon CEACAM1-mediated trans-homophilic membrane adhesion, the level of parallel CEACAM1 cis-dimers increased, and the average number of molecules per cluster decreased. Together, our data provide for the first time evidence for an allostery-based mechanism Figure 1. SPR-based analysis of homophilic CEACAM1 ectodomain interactions. Sensorgrams were recorded in a BIAcore 2000 instrument. Rat and human CEACAM1 D(1-4)-Fc proteins were immobilized at a level of 7,100 response units (RU). (A and B) Five concentrations of rat D(1-4)-His (0.36-1.79 g/l, corresponding to 4.4-22.2 \u00b5M monomer) were analyzed in HBS/P20/3 mM EDTA (A) or HBS/P20/2 mM Ca 2+ /2 mM Mg 2+ (B). The corrected responses (cRU) for binding to rat D(1-4)-Fc, obtained by subtracting the response in the reference lane (human D(1-4)-Fc), are shown as black data points. The results of global curve fitting to each of the three reaction models (models 1-3; see Results, Materials and methods, and Fig. S1 ) are shown as residual plots above the sensorgrams.

In addition to these protein molecular particles, a large number of smaller background structures with volumes up to 500 voxels were recorded by both approaches (Fig. 2 , A and C). Similar amounts of particles of the same size distribution were seen in plain buffer specimens (Fig. 2 D) .

To test this possibility, 20 different, extended monomeric D(1-4) domains were divided into four equally long segments, and the mean of the two diameters of the ellipsoidal center cross sections of each segment was recorded. This showed that one end had a significantly larger mean diameter than the other end in all molecules.

The D1 domains of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 are very similar both in their primary and 3D structures (Watt et al., 2001) . All structures are shown both at atomic resolution (space-filling models), and at 20-\u00c5 resolution (nuclear scattering models). The two tandem domains of mouse CEACAM1 (Fig. 3 A) can easily be distinguished at 20-\u00c5 resolution. However, it should be noted that the displayed crystallographic structures represent nonglycosylated protein domains, whereas the molecular tomography of rat CEACAM1 in this study was made on highly glycosylated proteins. The tomographic structures are therefore expected to be somewhat larger and not as well resolved. Ig domains have two faces consisting of closely opposed sheets of \ue062 strands, CFG, and ABED faces (Fig. 3 D) . Fig. 3 B shows two unglycosylated CEACAM5 D1 domains in close contact at their CFG faces. It is believed that this represents a physiological interaction because mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that amino acid residues at the CFG surface are involved in homophilic adhesion (Watt et al., 2001) . Fig. 3 C shows two unglycosylated CEACAM1 D1 domains that are in contact via their ABED faces. However, it has been argued that this does not represent a physiological interaction because the ABED surface is highly hydrophobic and is believed to be covered by an oligosaccharide attached to Asn70 (Tan et al., 2002; Fedarovich et al., 2006) . Both of the structures (Fig. 3 , B and C) are compact to as C-dimers because their structure and shape can easily account for antiparallel intermembrane adhesion, which is mediated by mutual D1-D1 binding between the CFG \ue062-sheet faces (Fig. 3 B ; Watt et al., 2001) . Another type of D(1-4) dimers, referred to as A-dimers, was characterized by in-register, close binding between three or all four of the Ig domains (Fig. 4 , F and G). Because the liposome adhesion experiments (see the dominant species (45.2% and 56.1% of the molecules, respectively). In addition to the monomers, several complexes of homophilically bound D(1-4) ectodomains occurred, as judged both from the shapes and dimensions/volumes of the recorded particles. The most common complex type was fully or partly extended dimers held together only by reciprocal binding between the largest end domains (Fig. 4 E) . They were referred and EDTA, respectively. This shows that both types of dimers can form in the presence and absence of divalent cations, but that both dimerization reactions were enhanced by the divalent cations, which agrees with the SPR data. Furthermore, the homophilic binding affinity leading to C-dimer formation was significantly higher than that for A-dimer formation. This suggests that the C-dimers and A-dimers correspond to the type 1 and type 2 dimers recorded in the SPR-binding experiments, respectively, because the equilibrium concentrations of type 1 dimers were significantly higher than those of type 2 dimers.",

In all of the trimers, two of the ectodomains were closely associated in a parallel manner (representing A-dimers), whereas the third molecule was bound via its larger Ig domain to one of the larger end domains of the parallel A-dimer (Fig. 4 H) . Because the BIAcore experiments showed no D1-D4-or D4-D4-binding interactions, the binding domain in the parallel dimer must be one of the D1 domains.

Oligomer species higher than dimers were not observed, and Ca/Mg or EDTA did not influence the level of dimerization.",

At low D(1-4)/liposome ratio (protein/lipid [wt/wt] 1:90), the level of the D(1-4) dimers was similar to that of nonliposome-bound CEACAM1, whereas the higher oligomers disappeared almost completely (Fig. 7, A and B) .

Underestimation of A-dimer formation in the SPR-binding experiments could be caused by homophilic interactions between the immobilized CEACAM1 ectodomains that we could not account for in our SPR-binding algorithms. Another contributing factor might be that the formation of A-dimers, which we treated as one single reaction, is in reality composed of four cooperative reactions in which all of the four Ig domains participate.",

This demonstrates that molecular electron tomography has some advantages in characterization of gross conformations of single native molecules under physiological conditions. CEACAM1 anchored to liposomal membranes also appeared as flexible monomers and dimers, but the majority occurred in microclusters of closely packed molecules. Such clustering is expected, as predicted by Grasberger et al. (1986) , who demonstrated that the likelihood of forming dimers and higher oligomers increases many orders of magnitude when dimerizing proteins are oriented on membrane surfaces. The degree of clustering did not change significantly when the CEACAM1 ectodomain to lipid ratio was varied over a 90-fold range, which demonstrates that the clustering effect caused by orientation on a surface was much stronger than what would be expected from just increased protein concentration in liquid solution. In many of the clusters, it was not possible to distinguish the individual molecules or Ig domains. This is what is expected at a 20-\u00c5 resolution of closely packed molecules, but it should be emphasized that the cluster structures really reflect what assembled molecules look like at this level of resolution. However, in spite of this limitation, it was possible to calculate the approximate number of molecules within each cluster from determination of the cluster volumes.",

The bridging clusters were both smaller and had different molecular packing compared with the freesurface clusters, and the cross-linking results indicated that this was a result of formation of D1-mediated antiparallel adhesion. An important piece of information for the interpretation of the cross-linking data is that we could show that antiparallel C-dimers mediating cell-cell adhesion are not stabilized by amine-reactive cross-linkers (see M\u00fcller et al. on p. 569 of this issue). Thus, the cross-linked dimers should exclusively represent parallel A-dimers. Also, the truncated D(2-4) ectodomains gave rise to a small proportion of crosslinked dimers, although the weaker interaction mediated by D(2-4) was not picked up by the SPR analysis. However, the A-dimerization contributed by Ig domain D1 can also be stabilized by cross-linking because the proportion of stabilized results demonstrate that the more complex oligomerization of D(1-4) is a function of the interactions of the D1 domain and suggest that the adhesion-promoting property of CEACAM1 is an important regulator of the organization and intermolecular interactions of CEACAM1 within the membranebound clusters.",

Three different methods, SPR-binding analysis, molecular tomography, and chemical cross-linking, consistently demonstrated that CEACAM1 ectodomains occur as a mixture of monomers, dimers, and oligomers. The tomographic analyses showed that the CEACAM1 ectodomain is flexible, being able to adopt several different conformations as a result of hinge regions between all of the Ig domains. Antiparallel trans-dimers (C-dimers) and parallel cis-dimers (A-dimers) could be distinguished. Also, the SPR-binding analyses identified the C-and A-dimerization reactions and demonstrated a rapid transition between monomers and C-dimers. The N-terminal D1 domain participated both in C-and A-dimerization, whereas domains D2-D4 were involved only in A-dimerization. All three methods revealed a partial dependence of divalent cations, which favored decreased ectodomain flexibility and enhanced formation of multimeric complexes. Because both dimerization reactions were enhanced, extracellular Ca/Mg should contribute to formation of CEACAM1-mediated cell adhesion.",

However, the novel curve-fitting algorithms that we present in this study allowed us to identify two different reactions that resulted in the formation of two types of dimers and one type of trimer in the presence of divalent cations. The equilibrium dissociation constants that were obtained from the curve fitting were in good agreement with the equilibrium dissociation constants determined from the tomography data. Both methods gave constants that were of the same order of magnitude for either type of dimerization reaction and showed the same dependence on divalent cations. These findings strongly support the interpretations of both the SPR-binding analyses and the molecular electron tomography.",

In addition, the differences in the equilibrium constants and the proportion of C-and A-dimers obtained by the two methods suggest that the proportion of A-dimers might have been overestimated in the tomography experiments and/or that the formation of A-dimers might have been underestimated in the SPR-binding determinations. Overestimation of participate in dimer formation in Ig domains (Edmundson et al., 1975) . However, a simultaneous interaction of two areas in the same Ig domain has, to our knowledge, only previously been suggested for the adhesion molecules JAM-1 (Kostrewa et al., 2001) , NCAM (Soroka et al., 2003) , and TAG-1 (M\u00f6rtl et al., 2007) . The binding site in the CEACAM1 D1 domain that mediates trans-homophilic binding, and presumably operates in C-dimer formation, has been localized to the CFG face by site-directed mutagenesis (Watt et al., 2001) . The exact location of the other binding site in relation to the CFG face is unknown and could not be determined from the electron tomograms. Although crystallographic structures showing domains in close contact do not necessarily reflect a biologically relevant association, the finding of two unglycosylated CEACAM1 D1 domains in the asymmetric crystal unit that interact hydrophobically across the ABED faces (Fig. 3 C; Fedarovich et al., 2006) might indicate that this could represent the second binding site. However, in the crystal structure of mouse CEACAM1, this surface was covered by the oligosaccharide N linked to Asn-70 (Tan et al., 2002) , and therefore, it has been argued that the ABED surface of CEACAM N-terminal domains cannot participate in physiological homophilic binding (Fedarovich et al., 2006) . However, such a scenario should not be completely ruled out because oligosaccharides are flexible units, and it might be possible that the ABED surface would transiently and dynamically be exposed for participation in protein-protein interactions. Because CEACAM1 is variably glycosylated in different cell types and tissues (Odin et al., 1988; Singer et al., 2002) , glycosylation might even represent a mechanism to control its putative potential to form A-dimers.",

This might be a prerequisite for the allosterically regulated homophilic binding interactions that we propose play an important role in CEACAM1 adhesion-induced transmembrane signaling. A similar lack of disulfides occurs in the N-terminal Ig domain of CD2, which also has been demonstrated to change conformation upon adhesion (Li et al., 1996) . Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of CD2 has been shown to be in a metastable state, which can result in exchange of \ue062 strands between the domains in a CD2-dimer, resulting in a dimeric structure in which each domain is formed by the intercalation of two polypeptide D(1-4) dimers was significantly larger than that of D(2-4) under all conditions. Importantly, these findings show that the D1 domain can participate in mutual cis-binding in addition to trans-binding, demonstrating that it has two different homophilic binding sites, which is in agreement with the interpretation of the trimers identified by electron tomography. The cross-linked multimers formed by the D(1-4) ectodomains are clearly caused by the presence of domain D1 because no complexes larger than dimers were formed by D(2-4) under any conditions. These multimers most likely form because of the flexibility of the ectodomains, which allows combinations of parallel, A-type interactions between Ig domains belonging to several D(1-4) ectodomains (Fig. 8) .",

At a higher protein/liposome ratio, a significant increase in the amount of cross-linked D(1-4) A-dimers occurred. This was caused by the presence of domain D1 in the CEACAM1 ectodomain but was not a result of increased local concentration of membraneattached protein because a corresponding increase of crosslinked D(2-4) A-dimers did not occur. Instead, the enhanced A-dimer formation was most likely a function of D1-mediated, antiparallel (trans) C-dimerization because it only occurred at the higher protein/liposome ratio, which resulted in more efficient homophilic liposome adhesion. It was not simply a result of increased local concentration of CEACAM1 ectodomains in the membrane contact regions because the statistical analysis showed that the CEACAM1 clusters were at the same time rearranged to become significantly smaller. Rather, it suggests that formation of trans-C-dimers between liposomal membranes induced cis-A-dimer formation by an allosteric mechanism transmitted by Ig domain D1, which is in agreement with the tomographic results that showed an increased abundance of dimeric clusters in the liposomal bridges.",

All interaction analyses were performed at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of 20 \u00b5l/min in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Hepes (Hepes-buffered saline [HBS]), pH 7.4, and 0.005% P20 detergent supplemented with either 2 mM CaCl 2 /2 mM MgCl 2 or 3 mM EDTA. Histagged rat CEACAM1 ectodomains were injected for 3 min followed by buffer injection for 5 min. After each binding cycle, the chip surface was regenerated with two cycles of 4 M LiCl/HBS and one cycle of 0.25% P20/HBS. Corrected binding profiles (sensorgrams) for rat CEACAM1 ectodomains were obtained by subtracting the response in the reference lane (human CEACAM1-Fc) from the response in the binding lane (rat CEACAM1-Fc). Data modification including scale transformation and background subtraction was performed with the BIAevaluation program (version 3.1). Algorithms for global curve fitting to the different reaction models were written in IGOR Pro (version 6.0; WaveMetrics, Inc.). The basic equations and parameters used for mass transport calculations were described previously . Detailed descriptions of the reaction models and the equations underlying the curve fit algorithms are provided in Fig. S1 and the following paragraph. A molecular mass of 81 kD and a frictional ratio (f/f 0 ) of 1.256 were used for D(1-4)-His. Varying the frictional ratio between 1.256 and 1.43 did not result in any significant differences of the association/dissociation constants.",

The altered organization of the ectodomains would be transmitted via the transmembrane domains, resulting in a corresponding alteration of the intermolecular organization of the cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 8) . This might in turn influence binding/activation of SH2 domain-carrying enzymes, such as c-Src, SHP-1, and SHP-2, to the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of CEACAM1-L, causing a shift in the balance of kinase/phosphatase activation.

In monomers and dimers, inter-Ig domain flexibility was still visible(Fig. 6 Band Video 2). Because of the dense molecular packing, it was not possible to resolve individual ectodomains in the larger clusters, but the number of ectodomains within each cluster could be determined from its volume. The D(2-4) ectodomains clustered to almost the same extent as D(1-4)(Fig. 6C and Video 2); 85% of the molecules occurred in dimers and clusters(Fig. 6, H and I). However, smaller cluster sizes including up to four molecules were favored. Quantitative analysis of the cluster distribution in the solution and membrane-anchored states showed that membrane attachment altered the monomer/oligomer equilibrium and drove both D(1-4) and D(2-4) ectodomains from monomers into dimers and oligomers (compareFig. 4L withFig. 6 I).",
