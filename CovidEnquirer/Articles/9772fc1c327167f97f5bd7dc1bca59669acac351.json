A novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family has been identified as the cause of this pulmonary disease. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the development of fast and sensitive diagnostic assays. Results: A real-time quantitative RT-PCR was designed in the nsp11 region of the replicase 1B domain of the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome. To evaluate this quantitative RT-PCR, cRNA standards were constructed by in vitro transcription of SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 RNA using T7 RNA polymerase, followed by real-time RT-PCR. The assay allowed quantitation over a range of 10 2 to 10 8 RNA copies per reaction. Conclusions: Extrapolated to clinical samples, this novel assay has a detection range of 10 4 to 10 10 copies of viral genome equivalents per millilitre. In comparison to the current de facto cRNA Artus Biotech standard, the in-house cRNA standard gives a 100fold higher absolute quantity, suggesting a possible underestimation of the viral load when using the Artus Biotech standard. # 2005 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a new coronavirus type, of which the morphology and genome organization are very similar to those of other coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons showed that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses. 6, 7 The clinical case definition of SARS is essentially one of fever and pneumonia, with or without a contact history. In the absence of a definite history of contact with other SARS patients, it is not easy to differentiate SARS from other causes of atypical pneumonia. Laboratory SARS-CoV confirmation tests are therefore a critical clinical need. Detection of specific SARS-CoV antibodies has been a reliable way to confirm the diagnosis. Due to the fact that the antibody response appears only around day ten of the illness, IgM or other subtype assays have not been useful for closing the diagnostic window within the first week of illness.",

            "text": "Virus culture is relatively insensitive, and takes too much time to be clinically relevant. During the epidemic, a variety of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were developed 3,8 including a commercial ready-to-use RT-PCR kit (Artus Biotech, Hamburg, Germany). Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR in clinical samples offers the opportunity of diagnosis in an earlier stage of the disease. 9 In contrast to many other acute respiratory infections, viral loads in clinical samples are low in the first few days of illness and peak around day ten of the disease. Recently Ng and colleagues demonstrated the role of serum SARS-CoV viral load measurement as a prognostic marker, even on the first day of hospital admission. A high systemic viral load may directly lead to severe tissue damage, or indirectly through the activation of a potentially damaging immune reaction. 10 For SARS-CoV diagnosis, plasma or serum RT-PCR can be performed with high sensitivity during the first week of the disease. Stool and respiratory samples can be used during the second week, and serologic testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV can be used from day 21 onward. 11 A major advantage of real-time PCR is that amplification and analysis are completed in a closed system. The risk of contamination, which can confound conventional (nested) RT-PCR protocols, is markedly reduced. This paper presents a very sensitive and specific quantitative RT-PCR assay, which can contribute to a rapid and efficient diagnosis of SARS in case of a new outbreak.",

Specificity of the primers and probe was tested using other human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E. No detectable non-specific amplification of these coronaviruses took place. The sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR was investigated by assaying ten replicates of samples containing 10, 10 2 , 10 3 or 10 4 copies of the cRNA standard per reaction. One hundred copies of the standard cRNA were detected in all ten replicates. For ten genome equivalents per reaction, only one out of ten replicates was found to be positive. The standard deviation of the mean threshold cycle varied between 0.34 and 0.98 cycles, resulting in coefficients of variation ranging from 0.97 to 2.57%. The intra-assay reproducibility of the SARS-CoV real-time RT-PCR was assessed by running dilutions of the cRNA standards ranging from 10 7 to 10 2 copies per reaction. Each of these dilutions was assayed four times per run. The mean values of C T , the standard deviations and the coefficients of variation were determined. Table 1 shows that the SARS-CoV cRNA standards can be detected with a coefficient of variation of less than 0.7%. The interassay reproducibility of the SARS-CoV real-time RT-PCR was assessed by running dilutions of the cRNA standards ranging from 10 8 to 10 5 copies per reaction in several assay runs. The mean values of the C T , the standard deviations and the coefficients of variation were determined ( Table 2 ).

The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires a diagnostic test that can detect the SARS-CoV infection early in the course of illness. The SARS-CoV can be detected by conventional and real-time RT-PCR in specimens obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tracts, in plasma or serum, and in feces. 9,10,13-17 A conventional RT-PCR, although performed as a one-step reaction in a thermocycler, still requires the use of PAGE analysis for detection and it takes four to five hours to complete the test. This real-time RT-PCR, on the other hand, can generate complete results within a period of three hours. The speed of this assay combined with a minimum of manipulations that need to be performed, make this real-time RT-PCR an ideal routine protocol for high-throughput screening of possible SARS-CoV-infected samples.",

Furthermore, this assay has a sensitivity that is similar or even better than that reported for other existing real-time SARS-CoV assays. This sensitivity is achieved without the need for a nested step in the RT-PCR reaction. 18 During the first week of illness, the viral load in the upper respiratory tract specimens is very low, but will reach a peak around day ten of illness. Since early diagnosis is important, highly sensitive diagnostic methods are necessary to avoid false-negative results in samples that contain only trace amounts of the virus in the early phase of the infection. This study presents a diagnostic real-time quantitative assay that is sensitive enough to detect the presence of SARS-CoV even at an early stage of the illness. The potential for quantitation over a wide dynamic range (at least 6 logs) was demonstrated with low intra-and inter-assay variation. Furthermore, this method was highly specific for the SARS-CoV and gave no false-positive results with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E.",
