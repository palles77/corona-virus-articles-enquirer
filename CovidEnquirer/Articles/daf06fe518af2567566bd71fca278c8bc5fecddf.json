The mig gene is inducible in macrophages and in other cells in response to interferon (IFN)-% We have transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with cDNA encoding human Mig and we have derived CHO cell lines from which we have purified recombinant human Mig (rHuMig). rHuMig induced the transient elevation of [Ca2+]i in human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) and in cultured, activated human peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. No responses were seen in human neutrophils, monocytes, or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines. rHuMig was chemotactic for TIL by a modified Boyden chamber assay but rHuMig was not chemotactic for neutrophils or monocytes. The CHO cell lines, IFN-~/-treated human peripheral-blood monocytes, and IFN-~/-treated cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 all secreted multiple and identical HuMig species as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Using the CHO-derived rHuMig, we have shown that the species' heterogeneity is due to proteolytic cleavage at basic carboxy-terminal residues, and that the proteolysis occurs before and not after rHuMig secretion by the CHO cells. The major species of secreted rHuMig ranged from 78 to 103 amino acids in length, the latter corresponding to the full-length secreted protein predicted from the HuMig cDNA. Carboxy-terminal-truncated forms ofrHuMig were of lower specific activity compared to full-length rHuMig in the calcium flux assay, and the truncated species did not block the activity of the full-length species. It is likely that HuMig plays a role in T cell trafficking and perhaps in other aspects of the physiology of activated T cells.",

For the determination of apparent molecular weights, a Tris-glycine-SDS, 15% acrylamide gel was used according to Laemmli (22) . For immunoblotting, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell Inc., Keene, NH) using a solution of 10 mM sodium bicarbonate, 3 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.9/methanol of 8:2, in a TransBlot apparatus (Bio-iLad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at 45 V for 7 h in the cold. The membranes were blocked with 50 mM Tris/HC1, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaC1, 0.1% Tween-20, and 10% milk (1-2% fat) and all incubations and washes were done in the presence of the blocking solution.

The high-kD species of HuMig (see below) reproducibly comigrated with both prestained lysozyme as well as with lysozyme that had not been prestained. For this reason, the position of the prestained lysozyme on the immunoblots is designated as 14.3 kD, lysozyme's reported molecular mass, without regard to changes in the mobility of the marker due to prestaining.

The ability of the low-kD rHuMig to bind to the CMcellulose column after dialysis was presumably due to the lower ionic strength of the dialysis buffer ('--~0.02) as compared with the ionic strength of the initial CHO cell supernatants (~0.17).

Next, medium was harvested from C H O / H9 cells that had been incubated with or without protease inhibitors for various times from 1 to 24 h, and the media from the 1-12-h time points were concentrated appropriately so as to normalize the rHuMig concentrations among the samples. Western blot analysis of rHuMig produced by C H O / H 9 cells incubated without protease inhibitors, as shown in Fig. 3 , revealed that the pattern of rHuMig species did not change significantly over time, i.e., there was no evidence of processing occurring after secretion of the protein into the medium. In the presence of protease inhibitors, only the high-kD species accumulated, consistent with our presumption that the low-kD species were derived from the high-kD species by proteolytic processing. The effect of the protease inhibitors is consistent with proteolysis occurring before secretion since it has been shown that these agents can inhibit intracellular proteolysis (32) (33) (34) .

Fig. 9 B also shows that the carboxy terminal-deleted rHuMig, when added at 1,000 ng/ml still did not produce a maximal rise in [Ca2+]i, and 1,000 ng/ml of the terminal-deleted species attenuated, but failed to block completely the response to 3 ng/ml of the high-kD rHuMig.

Both IL-8 (40) and IP-10 (37) cause the migration of activated, but not of resting lymphocytes. The finding of lymphocyte chemotactic activity for IP-10 is of particular relevance to our work because Mig and IP-10 show a number of additional similarities. Along with platelet factor 4 and SDF-1 (19) , IP-10 (37) and Mig (18) lack the ELR motif shared among the other CXC chemokines, a motif that is crucial for binding and activating the IL-8 receptors (4, 5) . Computer-assisted sequence comparisons reveal that HuMig and IP-10 are somewhat more closely related to each other than they are to other chemokines (2) . In both the mouse and the human, Mig artd IP-10 are inducible in macrophages by IFN-~/ (17, 18, 41, 42) . Moreover, our data demonstrate that like rHuMig, riP-10 can cause a calcium flux in TIL and that rHuMig and riP-10 can each desensitize TIL to subsequent challenge with the other. The cross-desensitization data are consistent with rHuMig and riP-10 binding to identical receptor(s). Cross-desensitization by two ligands does not establish, however, that their receptor(s) are shared. For example, the chemoattractants formylpeptide and CSa demonstrate cross-desensitization when tested on neutrophils despite their binding to separate hepta-helical receptors (43) and IL-8 can desensitize neutrophils to C5a (44) . Despite the similarities, there is evidence that the activities of HuMig and IP-10 are not identical. In contrast to what has been reported for riP-10 (37), we have not thus far found HuMig to act on monocytes. And in assays of neovascularization in mice, riP-10 but not rHuMig was found to be inhibitory (16) .",

Recent work, particularly with IL-8 (64) and MIPI-~ (9), has suggested that chemokine binding to both soluble and cell-surface/extracellular matrix-associated glycosaminoglycans is important for chemokine function. Matrixbound chemokine could provide a fixed gradient up which a cell could move. Both for IL-8 (64) and for platelet factor 4 (65), the COOH-terminal domains have been shown to be essential for this binding to glycosaminoglycans. In addition, it has been proposed, based in part on data for C5a and its receptor, that the basic a-helical domains of the chemokines participate in the initial binding interactions with acidic residues in the extracellular domains of the chemokine receptors (2) .",

We have shown that rHuMig with a large COOH-terminal deletion is not only much diminished in its activity in the calcium flux assay, but also that the truncated rHuMig is unable to block the activity of the full-length protein. This suggests that decreased receptor binding may be the basis for diminished activity shown by the truncated rHuMig. Interactions with cell-surface glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate might be important in the binding of Hu-Mig to its receptor, and these interactions would be expected to be affected by deletion of HuMig's COOH terminus.",

Considering the likelihood that the truncated forms of HuMig will bind less readily to glycosaminoglycans in extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces, as compared to the full-length HuMig, it is possible that in tissue, as the distance from the HuMig-producing cell increases, the immobilized forms of HuMig would be those more truncated and less active. This would add another dimension to a chemotactic gradient that would now be formed not only by changes in ligand concentration, or density, but also by changes in the specific activities of the immobilized ligands, with specific activities increasing as the distance to the HuMig-producing cell diminishes.",

The production o f HuMig polypeptides of differing mobilities was most likely due to posttranslational modification, either augmentation o f the mass of the polypeptide by glycosylation, and/or proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein. The predicted HuMig protein lacks the sequence for N-linked glycosylation, and in other experiments not shown, digestion of rHuMig with peptide-Nglycosidase F or with O-glycanase failed to demonstrate HuMig produced by IFN-~-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes and THP-I cells, compared with rHuMig produced by CHO cells. Peripheral blood monocytes were cultured at a density of 106 cells/ ml for 48 h without or with 2,000 U/ml IFN-~/ (A). THP-1 cells were cultured at a density of 106 cells/n'd for 30 h without or with 2,000 U/ml IFN-3' (B). 40 ml of culture supematant from monocytes and 30 ml of culture supernatant froms THP-1 cells were collected. Before processing for analysis, conditioned medium from the rHuMig-producing cell line CHO/H9 was added to a sample taken from monocytes and from THP-1 cells incubated without IFN-% 1 ml of CHO/H9-conditioned medium was added to the monocyte sample, and 0.75 ml was added to the THP-1 sample. After collection of the supernatants, protease inhibitors were added and the samples were concentrated, subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HuMig serum 5092, and analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and irnmunoblotting.
