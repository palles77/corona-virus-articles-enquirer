To keep transparency, the China's National Health Commission reports confirmed, suspected, recovered and death case numbers daily, yet the epidemiological community is still calling for more information. Specifically, they want to have the critical ''Basic Reproduction Number\", R 0 .

Apparently, R 0 is a number depends on many parameters. It is useful in some idealized conditions to predict the development course of a given epidemic in a completely susceptible homogeneous population. However, to determine R 0 requires too much information to be realistic in the heat of a developing epidemic. Therefore, it is rarely observed in the field and is usually calculated via a mathematical model relying on tuning, which severely limits its usefulness. Furthermore, to adopt one constant number to describe the full course of an epidemic development is problematic, for the dynamic of the epidemic may exhibit different transmission pattern in difference phase of the event. Additionally, the course of the epidemic could change dynamically subject to various medical and administrative interventions. The R 0 frontline personnel in fighting the epidemic would need a quick and robust tool to detect minute and subtle changes of the epidemic course for effective management.",

To investigate this diffusivity process, the non-breaking wave-induced vertical mixing theory [3] was developed and has been successfully applied in the modeling of daily Escherichia coli fluctuations in nearshore water [4] .

This trend clearly shows the effectiveness of the quarantine. It is well known that for a disease without effective medicine, quarantine would be the best measure to contain the epidemic. If this trend holds, the epidemic should peak 3 days later from now (February 6th, 2020) on or around February 9th. At that time, the total existing infected cases would be between 37,000 and 44,000. This is a much more optimistic view. Fortunately, it is encouraging to see that the trends of all methods seem to converge. This estimate is based on the assumption that the overall conditions are not changing. As the quarantine effect becomes more apparent, more hospital mobilized, newly constructed hospitals open, new pharmaceutical interventions introduced, and more efficient medical management method instituted the transmission rate might even decrease faster. However, the large pool of suspected may delay the estimated peak time. Another special condition is also coming up: the return tide of the workers after the Spring Festival holiday, which may increase the transmission rate.",

Yet Prof. Nanshan Zhong, national leading scientist for this epidemic issue, estimated on January 28, 2020 that the peak might appear 7-10 days later. On February 2, Prof. Michael Levitt, Nobel Prize winner from the Stanford University of the United States published a report on website, announced that the peak will appear within one week. Meanwhile, popular media (New York Times, for example) is warning the potential of a pandemic. Facing such confusing information and uncertainty, a simple and robust estimate would serve the public better, we think.
