One year ago, a general guideline on the clinical evaluation of antimicrobial agents to treat respiratory infections was drafted in Japanese, leaving scope for critical discussion, and this has been translated into English, as there were no major changes. In this report, respiratory infections have been discussed under the headings \"acute respiratory tract infection\" and pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary diseases. Standardized criteria were set for the assessment of severity of infection and effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent in question. Severity was evaluated on the basis of a combined assessment of the severity of infection and severity of the clinical condition of the patients. Clinical effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent used was evaluated on the basis of clinical outcome as well as micro-biological outcome of the trial. Body temperature, local pain, cough, change in sputum quality, peripheral white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and chest radiograph were used as the parameters for the evaluation. To maintain the quality of specimens to be examined, Geckler's classification of specimens was used. This report was constructed based on the analysis of large amounts of material collected over the years, incorporating internal and external factors concerning the present evaluation methods. The newly suggested standardized criteria for clinical evaluation of the new antimicrobial drugs are expected to be practiced properly hereupon and subjected to further improvement if necessary.",

The guidelines for USA 1 and Europe, 2 which were presented at the meeting, showed 95% conformity with each other. Before that, in 1991, the first International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) was held in Brussels, Belgium. However, Japan had its own guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, known as Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and this went into effect from February 1990. 3, 4 Against this background at home and abroad, the Director of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy, Masatoshi Konno, established the Committee for Clinical Evaluation Methods for New Antimicrobial Agents as a special committee of the Society.

So, it was high time for Japan to establish its own clinical evaluation methods for antimicrobial agents which incorporated the viewpoints on international harmonization. The Committee for Clinical Evaluation Methods for New Antimicrobial Agents consisted of three separate committees: Committee for the Respiratory System, Committee for the Urinary System, and Committee for Preventing Postoperative Infections. An international meeting was held in 1995 during the 43rd General Meeting of the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, with the aim being international harmonization of the clinical evaluation of antimicrobial therapy. Mr. S. Ragnar Norrby of Sweden, representing the Committee for European Guidelines, Mr. Murray M. Lumpkin of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), United States, and Mr. William R. Darrow of the Schering Plough Research Institute, United States, were guest speakers. [5] [6] [7] On behalf of Japan, the three Subcommittee Chairmen of the Committee for Clinical Evaluation Methods for New Antimicrobial Agents announced the committee reports at that meeting. [8] [9] [10] The authors of this report belong to the Committee for the Respiratory System. 8 The Committee for the Respiratory system, guided by the principles of international harmonization, had organized regular meetings and drafted the general guidelines for the clinical evaluation of antimicrobial agents in the light of those issued by the FDA in the USA and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). 11 The next step was to investigate various viewpoints in order to establish the guidelines for Clinical Evaluation Methods for New Antimicrobial Agents to Treat Respiratory Infections. In this report, we have attempted to describe and discuss all the relevant details of the methods that should be adapted for the clinical evaluation of antimicrobial agents used to treat respiratory infections.",

This classification is appropriate for the clinical evaluation of antimicrobial agents, particularly during phase II and III trials and it can also be applied for phase IV trials.",

However, the distribution of the infectious pathogens varies according to the site of involvement. In acute tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess, the pathogens are -hemolytic streptococcus, Haemophillus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, in order of frequency. [19] [20] [21] In acute pharyngitis, 22,23 the most commonly encountered bacteria are S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and then -hemolytic streptococcus and S. aureus. Among the etiologic agents of acute bronchitis, 24 S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are frequently seen, followed by Moraxella (Branhamella). Other organisms are S. aureus and -hemolytic streptococcus with a lower frequency of occurrence. Mycoplasma upper respiratory tract infections are common during the prevalence period. 25 In addition, Chlamydia (Chlamydia psittaci and Chlamydia pneumoniae) is also involved in acute respiratory tract infection. 26 Patients infected by one of the above pathogens, as diagnosed by bacteriological examination, or those who are highly suspected to be infected but still not confirmed are appropriate subjects to include in a clinical trial of new antimicrobial agents.

The most important and commonly used methods for identifying an infectious pathogen, are microscopic examination of smears and culture of specimens in appropriate media. The sample should be collected with a sterile cotton swab before administration of the antimicrobial agent is commenced. The swab should be scratched along the posterior pharyngeal wall and uvula, and the surface of the suppurating tonsils in patients with pharyngitis and tonsillitis, respectively, to collect a sample. The sample is then cultured in an appropriate medium, e.g., blood agar medium, for 16-18 h at 37\u00b0C. In acute bronchitis, the sample is obtained from the purulent area of the sputum and is cultured as described above. Samples that may be contaminated with normal flora in the upper respiratory tract should be excluded to avoid the probability of error in evaluation. A specimen with 25 or more leucocytes and 10 or less epithelial cells per visual field (100 \u03eb magnification) is extremely likely to be expectorated from a lesion and the probability of identification of the etiologic agent is also extremely high. If the specimen does not satisfy the above conditions identification of the etiologic pathogen will be less likely. There-Acute tonsillitis.

As culture methods are not well practiced, a reliable diagnosis needs the detection of the antibody titer for a specific antigen or DNA of the pathogen in the serum. Precisely, a fourfold or higher increase in Mycoplasma antibody titers is observed between blood samples taken during the onset of the disease and during the convalescent period (usually after 2 weeks), or a rise of 64 times or higher and 320 times or higher in complement fixation (CF) and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) antibody titers, respectively, in a single sample is diagnostic of Mycoplasma infection. Similarly, in Chlamydia infection, a fourfold or higher rise in the CF antibody in paired serum samples or a 16-fold or higher increase in a single sample is diagnostic of Chlamydia infection.

Detection by the quantitative culture method of a microbial pathogen at 10 7 CFU/ml or more in a specimen is indicative of that organism being the etiologic agent. But an organism present in numbers lower than 10 7 /ml in a specimen obtained following the standard procedure with a minimal amount of normal oral flora contamination may also be the etiologic agent.

Therefore it is important that the concerned drug should cover the probable etiologic pathogens. However, a comparatively reliable prediction is possible on the basis of careful examination of the aforementioned host, agent, and environmental factors, close monitoring of the clinical conditions (prevalence, age, purulent sputum) and performing appropriate tests (peripheral white blood cell count, chest X-ray, and gram staining of a smear specimen of the purulent sputum). When a drug under trial (such as a macrolide or a new fluoroquinolone) reasonably covers the spectrum of pathogens (H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae, as well as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia) which are involved in community-acquired infections, it is not necessary to identify the etiologic pathogen at the beginning of treatment. This identification is important with drugs such as -lactams which target only bacterial infections. Of course, the importance of various culture tests and serodiagnosis can not be surpassed. In some cases a quick diagnosis is now also possible by employing molecular biology techniques such as the PCR method. Above all, collecting an appropriate specimen, selection of its culture methods, and, finally, proper evaluation is of utmost importance. [36] [37] [38] Inclusion criteria for patients",

[29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] These pathogens are encountered quite often in trials targeting pneumonia. It is therefore important to identify them using special media and selection media, or by serological tests. The evaluation criteria for serological tests should be set down beforehand. So far as Mycoplasma detection is concerned, antibody titers in a paired test sample taken at the onset of the disease and during the convalescence stage should show a fourfold or higher increase. And when a single sample titer is estimated, CF antibody titers and HA antibody titers should be 64 times and 320 times higher, respectively. Similarly, a diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumonia may be made if the CF antibody titers show a fourfold or higher increase in a paired test sample or it is 64 times or higher in a single test sample. [41] [42] [43] Cold agglutination titers rise simultaneously but are of limited value as they are also increased due to other factors. Pneumonia patients in whom the etiologic agent has been isolated and identified should be examined 3 days and 7 days after the onset and on the day of completion of treatment (maximum 14 days). The evaluation is conducted on the basis of the standardized criteria as described in the section \"Clinical evaluation of new antimicrobial agents in acute respiratory tract infection, subsection Standards for efficacy evaluation; Standards for evaluation of microbiological outcome.\"",

In many patients, and, in particular, during the early stages of pneumonia, expectoration of purulent sputum is inefficient and isolation of an etiologic agent is not possible. But it is very important to identify and follow the course of the causative pathogen in order to evaluate the clinical effect of a new antimicrobial agent. Therefore, efforts should be made to facilitate expectoration through measures such as the infusion of physiological saline. In some cases of pneumonia, a blood culture is useful to identify the etiologic agent (such as S. pneumoniae and S. aureus). Another factor which makes isolation of etiologic agents of pneumonia difficult during trials is pretreatment with some form of antimicrobial drug. Therefore, patients who have not received any antimicrobial drug since the onset of the disease should be included in the trial. Special attention should be given to those specific pathogens, such as Legionella, Mycoplasma, and Chlamydia, Bold entries indicate patients who should be studied under special trial settings symptoms of pneumonia and improvement or lack of progression of all abnormalities on chest radiograph. In patients with accompanying underlying disease or complications, complete resolution is not achieved, and the standardized criteria are not satisfied (in particular, CRP value and body temperature) during this 14 days. In such patients, it is necessary to provide objective proof of improvement after treatment to evaluate the drug as \"effective\", such as comparable records prior to onset of pneumonia and after the treatment. The clinical effect of the study drug should be evaluated as early as 3 days after the commencing of treatment, and the speed of clinical recovery should also be considered in combination. When a trend of improvement in the standard criteria is absent, the next evaluation after 7 days is not necessary; instead, the drug should be discontinued and the administration of an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be initiated.",

Therefore, follow-up observations for a defined period of time are important to rule out such possibilities. A 1-week period is considered to be adequate for the follow-up evaluation of pneumonia, and this time the evaluation is final.

Administration of antimicrobials should be initiated at the earliest possible time. Sometimes, an acute exacerbation is due more to an underlying disease or complication rather than the infection itself. Acute exacerbation due to bacterial causes is characterized by increased cough, sputum production, and dyspnea, in addition to development of sputum purulence. The amount of sputum and the degree of purulence (purulent, muco-purulent, and mucoid) are good indicators for clinical assessment. A suitable specimen of respiratory secretion is essential for identification of the etiologic pathogens. Isolation of the causative organism is necessary for a proper evaluation of the efficacy of the study drug. The commonly encountered microorganisms in acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary diseases are H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, including other streptococci, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and S. aureus, as well as K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas, and anaerobic bacteria. 44, 45 Many of these microbes are established to be involved in community-acquired infection, except for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas. In contrast, MRSA and Pseudomonas have been isolated in patients with a long history of persistent infection and comparatively severe underlying respiratory diseases. 46, 47 Improvements in the symptoms and signs have mainly been considered in the design of conventional evaluation standards for the clinical effects of an antimicrobial agent, whereas the effects of the drug on the etiologic agent have not been given importance. Even though deterioration in clinical condition can be assessed by increased body temperature, peripheral white blood cell count, and CRP values, the absence of fever and increased white blood cell count do not rule out the possibility of acute exacerbation. Analysis of conventional evaluation data has shown that 30%-40% of such patients did not have fever and an increase in white blood cell count was observed in only 40% of patients. Therefore, it is important to conduct the evaluation of microbiological effects along with the clinical effects for a better outcome.

The common indicators for assessment of severity of infection include fever, peripheral white blood cell count, and CRP values. But in some instances, cases such as aggravation of persistent Pseudomonas infection in patients with severe underlying lung diseases (such as severe diffuse panbronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, old lung tuberculosis, and tracheostomy) these indicators do not show significant changes, while dyspnea may become severe.",

Isolation of the etiologic agent from a specimen of respiratory secretion largely depends on the quality of the specimen. A purulent sputum specimen containing \u03fe25 WBC per field and \u03fd10 squamous epithelial cells at \u03eb100 magnification may provide a good opportunity to determine the causative pathogen by Gram staining and culture. In gross appearance, the sputum should contain yellow or green portions which should be used for tests. Care should be taken to avoid a falsenegative result often obtained by examining mucoid sputum containing a lot of saliva. Mucoid sputum may be expectorated even under stable conditions without infection in patients with chronic bronchitis and chronic pulmonary emphysema. An increase in the sputum volume is a sign of exacerbation of infection, but if the sputum is mucoid, the infection is viral in origin, and is not a target infection for evaluation of antimicrobial agent therapy and, therefore, should not be included in the evaluation study. When there are inadequate and inefficient supplies of specimen, transtracheal aspiration or bronchoscopy may help in obtaining a quality sample of respiratory exudate. Selection of the appropriate culture medium is also important for the correct identification of the causative agent. Usually, almost all aerobic bacteria can be isolated on a blood agar or chocolate agar medium. Serological diagnostic methods are not helpful in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases, in contrast to pneumonia. Evaluation of the microbiological outcome may be conducted using a similar standard procedure to that described in the section. \"Clinical evaluation of new antimicrobial agents in acute respiratory tract infection\", subsection \"Standards for efficacy evaluation; standards for evaluation of microbiological outcome.\"",

The CRP is a very sensitive indicator for tracking the effects of chemotherapy. A trial drug may be evaluated as \"effective\" when the CRP value shows an improvement or becomes negative. But there are exceptions to this observation. Even though peripheral white blood cell count is an important indicator for evaluation of the clinical effects of a new antimicrobial agent, previous trials have shown that WBC count does not increase (\u03fe8000/mm 3 ) in some patients (approximately 40%) with chronic pulmonary diseases. Similarly, certain patients did not show a clear-cut increase in CRP value (0.7 mg/dl in approximately 5% of the patients). In such patients, therefore, careful attention should be paid to clinical criteria, such as cough and sputum, for evaluation. In addition, peripheral WBC count and CRP values may fluctuate due to underlying conditions such as connective tissue diseases, and the evaluation of the trial drug in such patients must be conducted with great care. The standardized criteria for evaluation of the clinical effects of a new antimicrobial drug in patients with chronic pulmonary disease are summarized in Table 11 . As shown in Table 11 , a drug would be considered \"effective\" when there is improvement in cough and sputum condition and in addition, two out of the remaining three criteria are satisfied and the other one is not worsened. A failure to meet the above standardized criteria would evaluate the trial drug as \"ineffective\". Further, the remark \"evaluation not possible\" is applied when the standardized criteria are beyond the scope of evaluation for any reason. Efficacy evaluation of the trial drug is conducted 3",

Evaluation of the clinical effects after the drug has been administered for 3 days, based on the standardized criteria may help to assess the speed of improvement in the clinical and microbiological status. In patients satisfying the efficacy criteria after 3 days' administration of the antimicrobial agent, the agent may be evaluated as \"extremely effective\". In general, evaluation after 7 days', treatment provides reasonably sufficient information to justify defermination of the efficacy of the trial drug. If the drug is effective, the etiologic agent would be eradicated after this time and the residual signs and symptoms, if any, would reach the baseline level of the particular patient during the stable state (i.e., before the exacerbation of the chronic pulmonary disease). Sometimes the treatment is extended for another 7 days as there is improvement in the signs and symptoms but not enough to discontinue the drug. But particular attention should be paid in patients who receive long term antimicrobial therapy, in terms of microbial substitution and development of resistance. If the drug is suspected to be ineffective, it should be discontinued immediately and the switch over to a suitable drug should not be delayed.",

The precise schedule should be mentioned in the protocol in advance. Usually, a post-therapy follow-up for 1 week is considered adequate to rule out the possibility of recurrence or reinfection. Laboratory tests such as microscopy of the stained smear, culture, and, particularly, quantitative assessment of the microbes in the respiratory secretions are very useful for a precise evaluation of the recurrence and reinfection during the post-therapy period.",
