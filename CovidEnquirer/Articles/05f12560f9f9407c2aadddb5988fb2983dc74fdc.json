For the first time, Isatis tinctoria L. hairy root cultures were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet-A, ultraviolet-B, and ultraviolet-C) in an attempt to promote the production of pharmacologically active flavonoids. Results showed that the maximum flavonoid accumulation (7259.12 \u00b1 198.19 \u03bcg/g DW) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures treated by 108 kJ/m 2 dose of UV-B radiation increased 16.51-fold as compared with that in control (439.68 \u00b1 8.27 \u03bcg/g DW). Additionally, antioxidant activity enhancement and cell wall reinforcement were found in the treated I. tinctoria hairy root cultures, indicating the positive-feedback responses to oxidative stress mediated by ultraviolet-B radiation. Moreover, the expression of chalcone synthase gene was tremendously up-regulated (up to 405.84-fold) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures following ultraviolet-B radiation, which suggested chalcone synthase gene might play a crucial role in flavonoid augmentation. Overall, the present work provides a feasible approach for the enhanced production of biologically active flavonoids in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures via the simple supplementation of ultraviolet-B radiation, which is useful for the biotechnological production of these high-added value compounds to fulfil the ever-increasing demand in pharmaceutical fields.",

Prior to elicitation experiments, a series of flasks containing ITHRCs (24 day-old) with 150 mL of fresh culture media were placed in a laminar flow cabinet, and the sterile membranes of these flasks were taken off for exposing hairy root cultures to UV radiation. The UV light lamps (UV-A: 40 W, \u03bb max = 365 nm; UV-B: 40 W, \u03bb max = 313 nm; UV-C: 40 W, \u03bb max = 254 nm; Beijing Institute of Electric Light Source, China) were mounted on fixtures at the top of hairy root cultures, and the distance of lamps from cultures was adjusted to obtain a constant radiation intensity (3 W/m 2 ) measured with a DRC-100X photometer (Spectronics, USA). The UV radiation dose (kJ/m 2 ) in this work was calculated by multiplying the fixed output value (3 W/m 2 ) with the exposure duration. During elicitation experiments, three groups of ITHRCs (24 day-old) were individually subjected to UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C with successive time points of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 15 h, which were equivalent to UV radiation doses of 0, 10.8, 21.6, 43.2, 64.8, 86.4, 97.2, 108, 118.8, 140.4 , and 162 kJ/ m 2 , respectively. For control, a group of ITHRCs (24 day-old) underwent the same conditions in the dark. After elicitation experiments, hairy roots were collected, rinsed by distilled water, and divided into three parts: one being dried in a vacuum oven for the liquid-solid extraction of flavonoids, one being handled quickly in fresh state for the evaluation of antioxidant enzyme activity, and one being frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for the extraction of total RNA.

Generally, plants are able to specifically perceive diverse types of UV photons and trigger different signal transduction pathways, which can induce distinct effects on plant secondary metabolisms, and eventually result in accumulating different levels of secondary metabolites (Matsuura et al., 2013) . Additionally, UV radiation dose is a critical parameter that can strongly influence the accumulation of certain secondary metabolites in a specific plant in vitro culture (Schreiner et al., 2016) . It is well documented that the mild UV radiation can predispose plant cells/organs to a state of low alert via stimuli-specific signaling pathways, which is beneficial for boosting up the biosynthesis of defense secondary metabolites (Anjum et al., 2017; Hideg et al., 2013; Pandey and Pandey-Rai, 2014) . In view of this, an appropriate UV radiation intensity of 3 W/m 2 was adopted according to the relevant literatures (Anjum et al., 2017; Pandey and Pandey-Rai, 2014) . In this work, the UV radiation dose (kJ/m 2 ) was calculated by multiplying 3 W/m 2 with the exposure time.",

As reported previously, ITHRCs cultured at day 24 exhibited the maximum productivity of flavonoids and biomass (Gai et al., 2015) . Based on the foregoing, UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C with successive radiation doses of 0-162 kJ/m 2 (equivalent to exposure time of 0-15 h) were adopted to treat 24 day-old ITHRCs for comprehensively comparing the elicitation effects on flavonoid accumulation on one hand, and in an attempt to further enhance flavonoid production without affecting biomass yield on the other hand.",

And the optimal elicitation effects of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C were found at radiation doses of 86.4, 108, and 108 kJ/m 2 , where the flavonoid yield increased 3.69-, 16.51-, and 4.73-fold relative to controls, respectively. As expected, the application of UV treatment was indeed feasible for the augmented production of flavonoids in ITHRCs. Moreover, it is worth noting that UV-B exhibited superiority in elevating flavonoid yield as compared with UV-A and UV-C. The flavonoid yield in ITHRCs challenged by UV-B was observed to increase significantly from 0 to 86.4 kJ/m 2 , reach its maximum level at 108 kJ/m 2 , and decrease gradually afterwards. Generally, UV-B is capable of causing two contrary stresses on plant metabolism, which is closely related to the radiation dose (Hideg et al., 2013) . In detail, exposure of plants to UV-B radiation under mild dose can lead to the reversible and elastic eustress that contributes to the activation of plant defense secondary metabolisms for self-protection, and when the exposure exceeds a tolerance-limit dose, plants will suffer from the irreversible and plastic distress that results in metabolic damage or plant cell/organ death in extreme cases. As inferred, the optimal UV-B radiation dose (108 kJ/m 2 ) obtained in this work might maintain the balance between eustress and distress in ITHRCs, which is conducive to maximally inducing flavonoid accumulation.",

In this work, an obvious indication of oxidative stress was observed in UV-B treated ITHRCs that the elicited root tissues (Fig. 3B ) exhibited browning color as compared with control (Fig. 3A) . However, more conclusive evidences should be provided for verifying the occurrence of oxidative stress in ITHRCs following UV-B elicitation. Factually, the existence of an efficient antioxidant defense system mainly comprised of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant metabolites in higher plants can contribute to detoxifying the detrimental effects of ROS-mediated oxidative stress (Gill and Tuteja, 2010) . In this regard, activities of four typical antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX, and GR) and antioxidant capacities of non-enzymatic extracts were measured as proxies for the evaluation of oxidative stress in ITHRCs following UV-B treatment.",

Additionally, extracts from UV-B treated ITHRCs showed superiority in antioxidant efficacies determined by DPPH radicalscavenging assay (Fig. 3G ) and \u03b2-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching test (Fig. 3H) . To be exact, the UV-B elicited samples exhibited better antiradical activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition capacity, corresponding to lower IC 50 values (0.18 mg/mL and 0.22 mg/mL) than those in control (0.43 mg/mL and 0.39 mg/mL), respectively. In this work, the significant increase of total flavonoids, especially the multiple hydroxyl-substituted flavonoids (rutin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol), might contribute to the enhancement in antioxidant activity of UV-B treated samples. Meanwhile, UV-B radiation can stimulate the excessive production of other antioxidant metabolites (ascorbic acid, glutathione, praline, tocopherol, carotenoid, etc.) in plants (Gill and Tuteja, 2010) , which might also contribute to the higher antioxidant property of UV-B treated samples. Overall, the enhancement of both antioxidant enzyme activities and non-enzymatic antioxidant properties of extracts was a positive-feedback response to counteract oxidative stress, which provided an indirect evidence of the occurrence of oxidative stress in UV-B treated ITHRCs.",

Accordingly, FTIR analysis was adopted to compare the functional group modifications of lignin in cell walls between UV-B treated root samples and control. As shown in Fig. 4A , the significant enhancement in intensities of lignin characteristic peaks at 1258 cm \u22121 (guaiacyl/syringyl ring and CeO stretching vibration), 1512 cm \u22121 (aromatic skeletal vibration), and 1606 cm \u22121 (symmetric aromatic ring C]C stretching vibration) were observed in UV-B treated sample as compared with the control spectrum. So, it is inferred that the enrichment of lignin in the treated root tissues might be induced by the oxidative stress following UV-B radiation. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that lignin is an aromatic polymer that can provide the strength and density of cell walls (Vanholme et al., 2010) . Therefore, the enhanced lignification of cell walls within the treated root samples also suggested an attempt to attenuate UV-B radiation for self-protection. Additionally, SEM examination was applied to compare the morphology structure modifications of samples between UV-B treatment and control. It is clearly observed from Fig. 4B that the surface of control samples possessed abundant branching root hairs with the intact appearance of long unicellular tubes. On the contrary, the root hairs in the surface of UV-B treated sample appeared severely crimped and disrupted (Fig. 4C) , which suggested an obvious indication of wound as the destructive consequence of UV-B stress.",

In view of this, the actual occurrence of ROS-mediated oxidative stress and wound event in ITHRCs following UV-B elicitation might contribute to stimulating the transcription of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.

Thus, control of CHS gene expression is an effective way to regulate flavonoid biosynthesis. It was reported that the suppression of CHS gene in tomato using RNAi silencing technology can reduce the total flavonoid levels up to a few percent of wild-type values (Schijlen et al., 2007) . Additionally, studies have shown that CHS gene expression is highly influenced by UV and blue light Wade et al., 2001) . Loyall et al. (2000) found that UV-B radiation could up-regulate the expression of CHS gene thus leading to J. Jiao et al. Industrial Crops & Products 118 (2018) 347-354 the enhanced accumulation of protective flavonoids in parsley cell cultures. And, oxidative stress was thought to act as a central regulating element in the event of UV-mediated signaling pathway to CHS gene. Similarly, the significant up-regulation of CHS gene in UV-B treated ITHRCs could be ascribed to the actual occurrence of ROS-mediated oxidative stress. Overall, the tremendous induction of CHS transcription here suggested that this gene might play a vital role in flavonoid augmentation in ITHRCs underlying UV-B treatment.",
