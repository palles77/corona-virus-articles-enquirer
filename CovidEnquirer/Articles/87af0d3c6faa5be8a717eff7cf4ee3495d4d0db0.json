            "text": "Accordingly, the revised guideline addresses the spectrum of health care delivery settings. Furthermore, the term ''nosocomial infections'' is replaced by ''health care-associated infections'' (HAIs), to reflect the changing patterns in health care delivery and difficulty in determining the geographic site of exposure to an infectious agent and/ or acquisition of infection. 2. The emergence of new pathogens (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] associated with SARS avian influenza in humans), renewed concern for evolving known pathogens (eg, Clostridium difficile, noroviruses, communityassociated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [CA-MRSA]), development of new therapies (eg, gene therapy), and increasing concern for the threat of bioweapons attacks, necessitates addressing a broader scope of issues than in previous isolation guidelines. 3. The successful experience with Standard Precautions, first recommended in the 1996 guideline, has led to a reaffirmation of this approach as the foundation for preventing transmission of infectious agents in all health care settings. New additions to the recommendations for Standard Precautions are respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette and safe injection practices, including the use of a mask when performing certain highrisk, prolonged procedures involving spinal canal punctures (eg, myelography, epidural anesthesia). The need for a recommendation for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette grew out of observations during the SARS outbreaks, when failure to implement simple source control measures with patients, visitors, and health care workers (HCWs) with respiratory symptoms may have contributed to SARS-CoV transmission. The recommended practices have a strong evidence base. The continued occurrence of outbreaks of hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses in ambulatory settings indicated a need to reiterate safe injection practice recommendations as part of Standard Precautions. The addition of a mask for certain spinal injections grew from recent evidence of an associated risk for developing meningitis caused by respiratory flora. 4. The accumulated evidence that environmental controls decrease the risk of life-threatening fungal infections in the most severely immunocompromised patients (ie, those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT] ) led to the update on the components of the protective environment (PE). 5. Evidence that organizational characteristics (eg, nurse staffing levels and composition, establishment of a safety culture) influence HCWs' adherence to recommended infection control practices, and thus are important factors in preventing transmission of infectious agents, led to a new emphasis and recommendations for administrative involvement in the development and support of infection control programs. 6. Continued increase in the incidence of HAIs caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in all health care settings and the expanded body of knowledge concerning prevention of transmission of MDROs created a need for more specific recommendations for surveillance and control of these pathogens that would be practical and effective in various types of health care settings.",

New to the section on transmission are discussions of bioaerosols and of how droplet and airborne transmission may contribute to infection transmission. This became a concern during the SARS outbreaks of 2003, when transmission associated with aerosol-generating procedures was observed. Also new is a definition of ''epidemiologically important organisms'' that was developed to assist in the identification of clusters of infections that require investigation (ie multidrug-resistant organisms, C difficile). Several other pathogens of special infection control interest (ie, norovirus, SARS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] category A bioterrorist agents, prions, monkeypox, and the hemorrhagic fever viruses) also are discussed, to present new information and infection control lessons learned from experience with these agents.

An important administrative priority that is described is the need for appropriate infection control staffing to meet the ever-expanding role of infection control professionals in the complex modern health care system. Evidence presented also demonstrates another administrative concern: the importance of nurse staffing levels, including ensuring numbers of appropriately trained nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) for preventing HAIs. The role of the clinical microbiology laboratory in supporting infection control is described, to emphasize the need for this service in health care facilities.

One important change is the recommendation to don the indicated personal protective equipment (PPE-gowns, gloves, mask) on entry into the patient's room for patients who are on Contact and/or Droplet Precautions, because the nature of the interaction with the patient cannot be predicted with certainty, and contaminated environmental surfaces are important sources for transmission of pathogens.

Two tables summarize recommended prevention and control practices using 7 categories of interventions to control MDROs: administrative measures, education of HCWs, judicious antimicrobial use, surveillance, infection control precautions, environmental measures, and decolonization. Recommendations for each category apply to and are adapted for the various health care settings. With the increasing incidence and prevalence of MDROs, all health care facilities must prioritize effective control of MDRO transmission. Facilities should identify prevalent MDROs at the facility, implement control measures, assess the effectiveness of control programs, and demonstrate decreasing MDRO rates. A set of intensified MDRO prevention interventions is to be added if the incidence of transmission of a target MDRO is not decreasing despite implementation of basic MDRO infection control measures, and when the first case of an epidemiologically important MDRO is identified within a health care facility.",

Much of the evidence cited for preventing transmission of infectious agents in health care settings is derived from studies that used ''quasiexperimental designs,'' also referred to as nonrandomized preintervention and postintervention study designs. 2 Although these types of studies can provide valuable information regarding the effectiveness of various interventions, several factors decrease the certainty of attributing improved outcome to a specific intervention. These include: difficulties in controlling for important confounding variables, the use of multiple interventions during an outbreak, and results that are explained by the statistical principle of regression to the mean (eg, improvement over time without any intervention). 3 Observational studies remain relevant and have been used to evaluate infection control interventions. 4, 5 The quality of studies, consistency of results, and correlation with results from randomized controlled trials, when available, were considered during the literature review and assignment of evidencebased categories (see Part IV: Recommendations) to the recommendations in this guideline. Several authors have summarized properties to consider when evaluating studies for the purpose of determining whether the results should change practice or in designing new studies. 2,6,7",

            "text": "I.B.1. Sources of Infectious Agents. Infectious agents transmitted during health care derive primarily from human sources but inanimate environmental sources also are implicated in transmission. Human reservoirs include patients, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] HCWs, 17, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] and household members and other visitors. [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] Such source individuals may have active infections, may be in the asymptomatic and/or incubation period of an infectious disease, or may be transiently or chronically colonized with pathogenic microorganisms, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Other sources of HAIs are the endogenous flora of patients (eg, bacteria residing in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract). [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] I.B.2. Susceptible Hosts. Infection is the result of a complex interrelationship between a potential host and an infectious agent. Most of the factors that influence infection and the occurrence and severity of disease are related to the host. However, characteristics of the host-agent interaction as it relates to pathogenicity, virulence, and antigenicity also are important, as are the infectious dose, mechanisms of disease production, and route of exposure. 55 There is a spectrum of possible outcomes after exposure to an infectious agent. Some persons exposed to pathogenic microorganisms never develop symptomatic disease, whereas others become severely ill and even die. Some individuals are prone to becoming transiently or permanently colonized but remain asymptomatic. Still others progress from colonization to symptomatic disease either immediately after exposure or after a period of asymptomatic colonization. The immune state at the time of exposure to an infectious agent, interaction between pathogens, and virulence factors intrinsic to the agent are important predictors of an individual's outcome. Host factors such as extremes of age and underlying disease (eg, diabetes 56,57 , human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome [HIV/ AIDS], 58,59 malignancy, and transplantation 18, 60, 61 ) can increase susceptibility to infection, as can various medications that alter the normal flora (eg, antimicrobial agents, gastric acid suppressors, corticosteroids, antirejection drugs, antineoplastic agents, immunosuppressive drugs). Surgical procedures and radiation therapy impair defenses of the skin and other involved organ systems. Indwelling devices, such as urinary catheters, endotracheal tubes, central venous and arterial catheters, [62] [63] [64] and synthetic implants, facilitate development of HAIs by allowing potential pathogens to bypass local defenses that ordinarily would impede their invasion and by providing surfaces for development of biofilms that may facilitate adherence of microorganisms and protect from antimicrobial activity. 65 Some infections associated with invasive procedures result from transmission within the health care facility; others arise from the patient's endogenous flora. 46 Clothing, uniforms, laboratory coats, or isolation gowns used as PPE may become contaminated with potential pathogens after care of a patient colonized or infected with an infectious agent, (eg, MRSA, 88 vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], 89 and C difficile 90 ). Although contaminated clothing has not been implicated directly in transmission, the potential exists for soiled garments to transfer infectious agents to successive patients.",

            "text": "I.B.3.b. Droplet Transmission. Droplet transmission is technically a form of contact transmission; some infectious agents transmitted by the droplet route also may be transmitted by direct and indirect contact routes. However, in contrast to contact transmission, respiratory droplets carrying infectious pathogens transmit infection when they travel directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious individual to susceptible mucosal surfaces of the recipient, generally over short distances, necessitating facial protection. Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks 91, 92 or during such procedures as suctioning, endotracheal intubation, [93] [94] [95] [96] cough induction by chest physiotherapy, 97 and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 98, 99 Evidence for droplet transmission comes from epidemiologic studies of disease outbreaks, [100] [101] [102] [103] from experimental studies, 104 and from information on aerosol dynamics. 91, 105 Studies have shown that the nasal mucosa, conjunctivae, and, less frequently, the mouth are susceptible portals of entry for respiratory viruses. 106 The maximum distance for droplet transmission is currently unresolved; pathogens transmitted by the droplet route have not been transmitted through the air over long distances, in contrast to the airborne pathogens discussed below. Historically, the area of defined risk has been a distance of , 3 feet around the patient, based on epidemiologic and simulated studies of selected infections. 103, 104 Using this distance for donning masks has been effective in preventing transmission of infectious agents through the droplet route. However, experimental studies with smallpox 107,108 and investigations during the global SARS outbreaks of 2003 101 suggest that droplets from patients with these 2 infections could reach persons located 6 feet or more from their source. It is likely that the distance that droplets travel depends on the velocity and mechanism by which respiratory droplets are propelled from the source, the density of respiratory secretions, environmental factors (eg, temperature, humidity), and the pathogen's ability to maintain infectivity over that distance. 105 Thus, a distance of , 3 feet around the patient is best considered an example of what is meant by ''a short distance from a patient'' and should not be used as the sole criterion for determining when a mask should be donned to protect from droplet exposure. Based on these considerations, it may be prudent to don a mask when within 6 to 10 feet of the patient or on entry into the patient's room, especially when exposure to emerging or highly virulent pathogens is likely. More studies are needed to gain more insight into droplet transmission under various circumstances.",

            "text": "Observations of particle dynamics have demonstrated that a range of droplet sizes, including those of diameter $ 30 mm, can remain suspended in the air. 109 The behavior of droplets and droplet nuclei affect recommendations for preventing transmission. Whereas fine airborne particles containing pathogens that are able to remain infective may transmit infections over long distances, requiring AIIR to prevent its dissemination within a facility; organisms transmitted by the droplet route do not remain infective over long distances and thus do not require special air handling and ventilation. Examples of infectious agents transmitted through the droplet route include B pertussis, 110 influenza virus, 23 adenovirus, 111 rhinovirus, 104 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 112 SARS-CoV, 21, 96, 113 group A streptococcus, 114 and Neisseria meningitides. 95, 103, 115 Although RSV may be transmitted by the droplet route, direct contact with infected respiratory secretions is the most important determinant of transmission and consistent adherence to Standard Precautions plus Contact Precautions prevents transmission in health care settings. 24, 116, 117 Rarely, pathogens that are not transmitted routinely by the droplet route are dispersed into the air over short distances. For example, although S aureus is transmitted most frequently by the contact route, viral upper respiratory tract infection has been associated with increased dispersal of S aureus from the nose into the air for a distance of 4 feet under both outbreak and experimental conditions; this is known as the ''cloud baby'' and ''cloud adult'' phenomenon. [118] [119] [120] I.B.3.c. Airborne Transmission. Airborne transmission occurs by dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei or small particles in the respirable size range containing infectious agents that remain infective over time and distance (eg, spores of Aspergillus spp and M tuberculosis). Microorganisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over long distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or even been in the same room with) the infectious individual. [121] [122] [123] [124] Preventing the spread of pathogens that are transmitted by the airborne route requires the use of special air handling and ventilation systems (eg, AIIRs) to contain and then safely remove the infectious agent. 11, 12 Infectious agents to which this applies include M tuberculosis, 124-127 rubeola virus (measles), 122 and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox). 123 In addition, published data suggest the possibility that variola virus (smallpox) may be transmitted over long distances through the air under unusual circumstances, and AIIRs are recommended for this agent as well; however, droplet and contact routes are the more frequent routes of transmission for smallpox. 108, 128, 129 In addition to AIIRs, respiratory protection with a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 or higher-level respirator is recommended for HCWs entering the AIIR, to prevent acquisition of airborne infectious agents such as M tuberculosis. 12 For certain other respiratory infectious agents, such as influenza 130, 131 and rhinovirus, 104 and even some gastrointestinal viruses (eg, norovirus 132 and rotavirus 133 ) , there is some evidence that the pathogen may be transmitted through small-particle aerosols under natural and experimental conditions. Such transmission has occurred over distances . 3 feet but within a defined air space (eg, patient room), suggesting that it is unlikely that these agents remain viable on air currents that travel long distances. AIIRs are not routinely required to prevent transmission of these agents. Additional issues concerning small-particle aerosol transmission of agents that are most frequently transmitted by the droplet route are discussed below. Although SARS-CoV is transmitted primarily by contact and/or droplet routes, airborne transmission over a limited distance (eg, within a room) has been suggested, although not proven. [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] This is true of other infectious agents as well, such as influenza virus 130 and noroviruses. 132, 142, 143 Influenza viruses are transmitted primarily by close contact with respiratory droplets, 23, 102 and acquisition by HCWs has been prevented by Droplet Precautions, even when positive-pressure rooms were used in one center. 144 However, inhalational transmission could not be excluded in an outbreak of influenza in the passengers and crew of an aircraft. 130 Observations of a protective effect of ultraviolet light in preventing influenza among patients with tuberculosis during the influenza pandemic of 1957-1958 have been used to suggest airborne transmission. 145, 146 In contrast to the strict interpretation of an airborne route for transmission (ie, long distances beyond the patient room environment), short-distance transmission by small-particle aerosols generated under specific circumstances (eg, during endotracheal intubation) to persons in the immediate area near the patient also has been demonstrated. Aerosolized particles , 100 mm in diameter can remain suspended in air when room air current velocities exceed the terminal settling velocities of the particles. 109 SARS-CoV transmission has been associated with endotracheal intubation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 93, 94, 96, 98, 141 Although the most frequent routes of transmission of noroviruses are contact and foodborne and waterborne routes, several reports suggest that noroviruses also may be transmitted through aerosolization of infectious particles from vomitus or fecal material. 142, 143, 147, 148 It is hypothesized that the aerosolized particles are inhaled and subsequently swallowed. Roy This conceptual framework can explain rare occurrences of airborne transmission of agents that are transmitted most frequently by other routes (eg, smallpox, SARS, influenza, noroviruses). Concerns about unknown or possible routes of transmission of agents associated with severe disease and no known treatment often result in the adoption of overextreme prevention strategies, and recommended precautions may change as the epidemiology of an emerging infection becomes more well defined and controversial issues are resolved.",

Under defined conditions, any infectious agent transmitted in a health care setting may become targeted for control because it is epidemiologically important. C difficile is specifically discussed below because of its current prevalence and seriousness in US health care facilities. In determining what constitutes an ''epidemiologically important organism,'' the following criteria apply: d A propensity for transmission within health care facilities based on published reports and the occurrence of temporal or geographic clusters of more than 2 patients, (eg, C difficile, norovirus, RSV, influenza, rotavirus, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, group A streptococcus). A single case of health care-associated invasive disease caused by certain pathogens (eg, group A streptococcus postoperatively, 160 in a burn unit, 161 or in a LTCF; 162 Legionella spp, 14, 163 Aspergillus spp 164 ) is generally considered a trigger for investigation and enhanced control measures because of the risk of additional cases and the severity of illness associated with these infections. I.C.1.a. Clostridium difficile. C difficile is a sporeforming gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that was first isolated from stools of neonates in 1935 165 and identified as the most frequent causative agent of antibioticassociated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in 1977. 166 This pathogen is a major cause of health care-associated diarrhea and has been responsible for many large outbreaks in health care settings that have proven extremely difficult to control. Important factors contributing to health care-associated outbreaks include environmental contamination, persistence of spores for prolonged periods, resistance of spores to routinely used disinfectants and antiseptics, hand carriage by HCWs to other patients, and exposure of patients to frequent courses of antimicrobial agents. 167 Antimicrobials most frequently associated with increased risk of C difficile include third-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, vancomycin, and fluoroquinolones.",

In general, MDROs are defined as microorganisms-predominantly bacteria-that are resistant to 1 or more classes of antimicrobial agents. 176 Although the names of certain MDROs suggest resistance to only a single agent (eg, MRSA, VRE), these pathogens are usually resistant to all but a few commercially available antimicrobial agents. This latter feature defines MDROs that are considered to be epidemiologically important and deserve special attention in health care facilities. 177 Other MDROs of current concern include multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is resistant to penicillin and other broad-spectrum agents such as macrolides and fluroquinolones, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB), especially those producing ESBLs; and strains of S aureus that are intermediate or resistant to vancomycin (ie, VISA and VRSA). MDROs are transmitted by the same routes as antimicrobial susceptible infectious agents. Patient-to-patient transmission in health care settings, usually via hands of HCWs, has been a major factor accounting for the increase in MDRO incidence and prevalence, especially for MRSA and VRE in acute care facilities. [199] [200] [201] Preventing the emergence and transmission of these pathogens requires a comprehensive approach that includes administrative involvement and measures (eg, nurse staffing, communication systems, performance improvement processes to ensure adherence to recommended infection control measures), education and training of medical and other HCWs, judicious antibiotic use, comprehensive surveillance for targeted MDROs, application of infection control precautions during patient care, environmental measures (eg, cleaning and disinfection of the patient care environment and equipment, dedicated single-patient use of noncritical equipment), and decolonization therapy when appropriate.",

An understanding of the epidemiology, modes of transmission, and clinical course of each disease, as well as carefully drafted plans that specify an approach and relevant websites and other resources for disease-specific guidance to health care, administrative, and support personnel, are essential for responding to and managing a bioterrorism event. Infection control issues to be addressed include (1) identifying persons who may be exposed or infected; (2) preventing transmission among patients, HCWs, and visitors; (3) providing treatment, chemoprophylaxis, or vaccine to potentially large numbers of people; (4) protecting the environment, including the logistical aspects of securing sufficient numbers of AIIRs or designating areas for patient cohorts when an insufficient number of AIIRs is available; (5) providing adequate quantities of appropriate PPE; and (6) identifying appropriate staff to care for potentially infectious patients (eg, vaccinated HCWs for care of patients with smallpox). The response is likely to differ for exposures resulting from an intentional release compared with a naturally occurring disease because of the large number of persons that can be exposed at the same time and possible differences in pathogenicity.",

Federal agency websites (eg, http://www. usamriid.army.mil/publications/index.html and http:// www.bt.cdc.gov) and state and county health department websites should be consulted for the most upto-date information. Sources of information on specific agents include anthrax, 203 smallpox, [204] [205] [206] plague, 207,208 botulinum toxin, 209 tularemia, 210 and hemorrhagic fever viruses. 211, 212 I.C.2.a. Pre-Event Administration of Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine to Health Care Workers. Vaccination of HCWsl in preparation for a possible smallpox exposure has important infection control implications. [213] [214] [215] These include the need for meticulous screening for vaccine contraindications in persons at increased risk for adverse vaccinia events; containment and monitoring of the vaccination site to prevent transmission in the health care setting and at home; and management of patients with vaccinia-related adverse events. 216, 217 The pre-event US smallpox vaccination program of 2003 is an example of the effectiveness of carefully developed recommendations for both screening potential vaccinees for contraindications and vaccination site care and monitoring. Between December 2002 and February 2005, approximately 760,000 individuals were vaccinated in the Department of Defense and 40,000 in the civilian or public health populations, including approximately 70,000 who worked in health care settings. No cases of eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, fetal vaccinia, or contact transfer of vaccinia were reported in health care settings or in military workplaces. 218, 219 Outside the health care setting, there were 53 cases of contact transfer from military vaccinees to close personal contacts (eg, bed partners or contacts during participation in sports such as wrestling 220 ). All contact transfers were from individuals who were not following recommendations to cover their vaccination sites. Vaccinia virus was confirmed by culture or PCR in 30 cases, 2 of which resulted from tertiary transfer. All recipients, including 1 breast-fed infant, recovered without complications. Subsequent studies using viral culture and PCR techniques have confirmed the effectiveness of semipermeable dressings to contain vaccinia. [221] [222] [223] [224] This experience emphasizes the importance of ensuring that newly vaccinated HCWs adhere to recommended vaccination site care, especially those caring for high-risk patients. Recommendations for pre-event smallpox vaccination of HCWs and vacciniarelated infection control recommendations are published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 216, 225 with updates posted on the CDC's bioterrorism website. 205 I.C.3. Prions. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, degenerative neurologic disorder of humans, with an incidence in the United States of approximately 1 person/million population/year. 226, 227 CJD is believed to be caused by a transmissible proteinaceous infectious agent known as a prion. Infectious prions are isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein known as the prion protein. The incubation period (ie, time between exposure and and onset of symptoms) varies from 2 years to many decades. However, death typically occurs within 1 year of the onset of symptoms. Approximately 85% of CJD cases occur sporadically with no known environmental source of infection, and 10% of cases are familial. Iatrogenic transmission has occurred, with most cases resulting from treatment with human cadaver pituitary-derived growth hormone or gonadotropin, 228, 229 from implantation of contaminated human dura mater grafts, 230 or from corneal transplants. 231 Transmission has been linked to the use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments or stereotactic electroencephalogram electrodes. [232] [233] [234] [235] Prion diseases in animals include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or ''mad cow disease'') in cattle, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk. 236 BSE, first recognized in the United Kingdom in 1986, was associated with a major epidemic among cattle that had consumed contaminated meat and bone meal. The possible transmission of BSE to humans causing variant CJD (vCJD) was first described in 1996 and was subsequently found to be associated with consumption of BSE-contaminated cattle products primarily in the United Kingdom. There is strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between the causative agent of BSE and vCJD. 237 Although most cases of vCJD have been reported from the United Kingdom, a few cases also have been reported from Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United States. Most persons affected with vCJD worldwide lived in or visited the United Kingdom during the years of a large outbreak of BSE (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) and may have consumed contaminated cattle products during that time (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/ diseases/cjd/cjd.htm). Although there has been no indigenously acquired vCJD in the United States, the sporadic occurrence of BSE in cattle in North America has heightened awareness of the possibility that such infections could occur and have led to increased surveillance activities. Updated information may be found at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/cjd/cjd.htm. The public health impact of prion diseases has been reviewed previously. 238 vCJD in humans has different clinical and pathologic characteristics than sporadic or classic CJD, 239 including (1) younger median age at death (28 [range, 16 to 48] vs 68 years), (2) longer median duration of illness (14 months vs 4 to 6 months), (3) increased frequency of sensory symptoms and early psychiatric symptoms with delayed onset of frank neurologic signs; and (4) detection of prions in tonsillar and other lymphoid tissues, not present in sporadic CJD. 240 Similar to sporadic CJD, there have been no reported cases of direct human-tohuman transmission of vCJD by casual or environmental contact, droplet, or airborne routes. Ongoing blood safety surveillance in the United States has not detected sporadic CJD transmission through blood transfusion; 241-243 however, bloodborne transmission of vCJD is believed to have occurred in 2 patients in the Uited Kingdom. 244, 245 The following FDA websites provide information on steps currently being taken in the United States to protect the blood supply from CJD and vCJD: http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/cjdvcjd.htm and http:// www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/cjdvcjdq&a.htm.",

SARS is a newly discovered respiratory disease that emerged in China late in 2002 and spread to several countries. 135, 140 In particular, mainland China, Hong Kong, Hanoi, Singapore, and Toronto have been significantly affected. SARS is caused by SARS-CoV, a previously unrecognized member of the coronavirus family. 247, 248 The incubation period from exposure to the onset of symptoms is typically 2 to 7 days, but can be as long as 10 days and in rare cases even longer. 249 The illness is initially difficult to distinguish from other common respiratory infections. Signs and symptoms usually include fever above 38.08C and chills and rigors, sometimes accompanied by headache, myalgia, and mild to severe respiratory symptoms. A radiographic profile of atypical pneumonia is an important clinical indicator of possible SARS. Compared with adults, children are affected less frequently, have milder disease, and are less likely to transmit SARS-CoV. 135, [249] [250] [251] The overall case fatality rate is approximately 6%; underlying disease and advanced age increase the risk of mortality (see http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_05_07a/en/).",

            "text": "Outbreaks in health care settings, with transmission to large numbers of HCWs and patients, haa been a striking feature of SARS; undiagnosed infectious patients and visitors have been important initiators of these outbreaks. 21, [252] [253] [254] The relative contribution of potential modes of transmission is not known precisely. There is ample evidence for droplet and contact transmission; 96, 101, 113 however, opportunistic airborne transmission cannot be excluded. 101, [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] 149, 254 For example, exposure to aerosol-generating procedures (eg, endotracheal intubation, suctioning) has been associated with transmission of infection to large numbers of HCWs outside of the United States. 93, 94, 96, 98, 253 Therefore, aerosolization of small infectious particles generated during these and other similar procedures could be a risk factor for transmission to others within a multibed room or shared airspace. A review of the infection control literature generated from the SARS outbreaks of 2003 concluded that the greatest risk of transmission is to those who have close contact, are not properly trained in use of protective infection control procedures, and do not consistently use PPE, and that N95 or higher-level respirators may offer additional protection to those exposed to aerosol-generating procedures and high-risk activities. 255, 256 Organizational and individual factors that affect adherence to infection control practices for SARS also were identified. 256 Control of SARS requires a coordinated, dynamic response by multiple disciplines in a health care setting. 9 Early detection of cases is accomplished by screening persons with symptoms of a respiratory infection for history of travel to areas experiencing community transmission or contact with SARS patients, followed by implementation of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette (ie, placing a mask over the patient's nose and mouth) and physical separation from other patients in common waiting areas. The precise combination of precautions to protect HCWs has not yet been determined. At the time of this publication, the CDC recommends Standard Precautions, with emphasis on the use of hand hygiene; Contact Precautions, with emphasis on environmental cleaning due to the detection of SARS-CoV RNA by PCR on surfaces in rooms occupied by SARS patients; 138, 254, 257 and Airborne Precautions, including use of fit-tested NIOSH-approved N95 or higher-level respirators and eye protection. 258 In Hong Kong, the use of Droplet and Contact Precautions, including the use of a mask but not a respirator, was effective in protecting HCWs. 113 However, in Toronto, consistent use of an N95 respirator was found to be slightly more protective than a mask. 93 It is noteworthy that no transmission of SARS-CoV to public hospital workers occurred in Vietnam despite inconsistent use of infection control measures, including use of PPE, which suggests other factors (eg, severity of disease, frequency of high-risk procedures or events, environmental features) may influence opportunities for transmission. 259 SARS-CoV also has been transmitted in the laboratory setting through breaches in recommended laboratory practices. Research laboratories in which SARS-CoV was under investigation were the source of most cases reported after the first series of outbreaks in the winter and spring of 2003. 260 Lessons learned from the SARS outbreaks are useful in devising plans to respond to future public health crises, such as pandemic influenza and bioterrorism events. Surveillance for cases among patients and HCWs, ensuring availability of adequate supplies and staffing, and limiting access to health care facilities were important factors in the response to SARS. 9 Guidance for infection control precautions in various settings is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars. I.C.5. Monkeypox. Monkeypox is a rare viral disease found mostly in the rain forest countries of Central and West Africa. The disease is caused by an orthopoxvirus that is similar in appearance to smallpox but causes a milder disease. The only recognized outbreak of human monkeypox in the United States was detected in June 2003, after several people became ill after contact with sick pet prairie dogs. Infection in the prairie dogs was subsequently traced to their contact with a shipment of animals from Africa, including giant Gambian rats. 262 This outbreak demonstrates the importance of recognition and prompt reporting of unusual disease presentations by clinicians to enable prompt identification of the etiology, as well as the potential of epizootic diseases to spread from animal reservoirs to humans through personal and occupational exposure. 263 Only limited data on transmission of monkeypox are available. Transmission from infected animals and humans is believed to occur primarily through direct contact with lesions and respiratory secretions; airborne transmission from animals to humans is unlikely but cannot be excluded, and may have occurred in veterinary practices (eg, during administration of nebulized medications to ill prairie dogs 264 ). In humans, 4 instances of monkeypox transmission in hospitals have been reported in Africa among children, usually related to sharing the same ward or bed. 265, 266 Additional recent literature documents transmission of Congo Basin monkeypox in a hospital compound for an extended number of generations. 267 There has been no evidence of airborne or any other person-to-person transmission of monkeypox in the United States, and no new cases of monkeypox have been identified since the outbreak in June 2003. 268 The outbreak strain is a clade of monkeypox distinct from the Congo Basin clade and may have different epidemiologic properties (including human-to-human transmission potential) from monkeypox strains of the Congo Basin; 269 this awaits further study. Smallpox vaccine is 85% protective against Congo Basin monkeypox. 270 Because there is an associated case fatality rate of , 10%, administration of smallpox vaccine within 4 days to individuals who have had direct exposure to patients or animals with monkeypox is a reasonable policy. 271 For the most current information on monkeypox, see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/mon keypox/clinicians.htm.",

Of note, there is nearly a 5-fold increase in the risk to patients in outbreaks when a patient is the index case compared with exposure of patients during outbreaks when a staff member is the index case. 286 The average incubation period for gastroenteritis caused by noroviruses is 12 to 48 hours, and the clinical course lasts 12 to 60 hours. 272 Illness is characterized by acute onset of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and/or diarrhea. The disease is largely self-limited; rarely, death due to severe dehydration can occur, particularly in elderly persons with debilitating health conditions.",

            "text": "The epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks shows that even though primary cases may result from exposure to a fecally contaminated food or water, secondary and tertiary cases often result from person-to-person transmission facilitated by contamination of fomites 272, 287 and dissemination of infectious particles, especially during the process of vomiting. 132, 142, 143, 147, 148, 272, 278, 279 Widespread, persistent, and inapparent contamination of the environment and fomites can make outbreaks extremely difficult to control. 147, 274, 283 These clinical observations and the detection of norovirus DNA on horizontal surfaces 5 feet above the level that might be touched normally suggest that under certain circumstances, aerosolized particles may travel distances beyond 3 feet. 147 It is hypothesized that infectious particles may be aerosolized from vomitus, inhaled, and swallowed. In addition, individuals who are responsible for cleaning the environment may be at increased risk of infection. Development of disease and transmission may be facilitated by the low infectious dose (ie, , 100 viral particles) 288 and the resistance of these viruses to the usual cleaning and disinfection agents (ie, they may survive , 10 ppm chlorine). [289] [290] [291] An alternate phenolic agent that was shown to be effective against feline calicivirus was used for environmental cleaning in one outbreak. 275, 292 There are insufficient data to determine the efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs against noroviruses when the hands are not visibly soiled. 293 Absence of disease in certain individuals during an outbreak may be explained by protection from infection conferred by the B histo-blood group antigen. 294 Consultation on outbreaks of gastroenteritis is available through the CDC's Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases. 295 I.C.7. Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses. HFV is a mixed group of viruses that cause serious disease with high fever, skin rash, bleeding diathesis, and, in some cases, high mortality; the resulting disease is referred to as viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). Among the more commonly known HFVs are Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), Lassa virus (Arenaviridae), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley Fever virus (Bunyaviridae), and Dengue and Yellow fever viruses (Flaviviridae). 212, 296 These viruses are transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or via arthropod vectors. Although none of these viruses is endemic in the United States, outbreaks in affected countries provide potential opportunities for importation by infected humans and animals. Furthermore, there is a concern that some of these agents could be used as bioweapons. 212 Person-to-person transmission has been documented for Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Crimean-Congo HFVs. In resource-limited health care settings, transmission of these agents to HCWs, patients, and visitors has been described and in some outbreaks has accounted for a large proportion of cases. [297] [298] [299] Transmission within households also has been documented in individuals who had direct contact with ill persons or their body fluids, but not in those who did not have such contact. 300 Evidence concerning the transmission of HFVs has been summarized previously. 212, 301 Person-to-person transmission is associated primarily with direct blood and body fluid contact. Percutaneous exposure to contaminated blood carries a particularly high risk for transmission and increased mortality. 302, 303 The finding of large numbers of Ebola viral particles in the skin and the lumina of sweat glands has raised concerns that transmission could occur from direct contact with intact skin, although epidemiologic evidence to support this is lacking. 304 Postmortem handling of infected bodies is an important risk for transmission. 300, 305, 306 In rare situations, cases in which the mode of transmission was unexplained among individuals with no known direct contact have led to speculation that airborne transmission could have occurred. 297 However, airborne transmission of naturally occurring HFVs in humans has not been documented. A study of airplane passengers exposed to an in-flight index case of Lassa fever found no transmission to any passengers. 307 In the laboratory setting, animals have been infected experimentally with Marburg or Ebola virus through direct inoculation of the nose, mouth, and/or conjunctiva 308,309 and by using mechanically generated viruscontaining aerosols. 310, 311 Transmission of Ebola virus among laboratory primates in an animal facility has been described. 312 The secondarily infected animals were in individual cages separated by approximately 3 meters. Although the possibility of airborne transmission was suggested, the investigators were not able to exclude droplet or indirect contact transmission in this incidental observation.",

In less developed countries, outbreaks of HFVs have been controlled with basic hygiene, barrier precautions, safe injection practices, and safe burial practices. 298, 305 The preponderance of evidence on HFV transmission indicates that Standard, Contact, and Droplet Precautions with eye protection are effective in protecting HCWs and visitors coming in contact with an infected patient. Single gloves are adequate for routine patient care; doublegloving is advised during invasive procedures (eg, surgery) that pose an increased risk of blood exposure. Routine eye protection (ie goggles or face shield) is particularly important. Fluid-resistant gowns should be worn for all patient contact. Airborne Precautions are not required for routine patient care; however, use of AIIRs is prudent when procedures that could generate infectious aerosols are performed (eg, endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning, autopsy procedures involving oscillating saws). N95 or higher-level respirators may provide added protection for individuals in a room during aerosol-generating procedures ( Table 3 , Appendix A). When a patient with a syndrome consistent with hemorrhagic fever also has a history of travel to an endemic area, precautions are initiated on presentation and then modified as more information is obtained ( Table 2) . Patients with hemorrhagic fever syndrome in the setting of a suspected bioweapons attack should be managed using Airborne Precautions, including AIIRs, because the epidemiology of a potentially weaponized hemorrhagic fever virus is unpredictable.",

Intensive care units (ICUs) serve patients who are immunocompromised by disease state and/or by treatment modalities, as well as patients with major trauma, respiratory failure, and other life-threatening conditions (eg, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, overdose, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, hepatic failure, multiorgan system failure, and extremes of age). Although ICUs account for a relatively small proportion of hospitalized patients, infections acquired in these units account for . 20% of all HAIs. 316 In the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) system, 26.6% of HAIs were reported from ICU and high-risk nursery (neonatal ICU [NICU]) patients in 2002 (NNIS, unpublished data). This patient population has increased susceptibility to colonization and infection, especially with MDROs and Candida spp, 317,318 because of underlying diseases and conditions, the invasive medical devices and technology used in their care (eg central venous catheters and other intravascular devices, mechanical ventilators, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, hemodialysis/filtration, pacemakers, implantable left-ventricular assist devices), the frequency of contact with HCWs, prolonged lengths of stay, and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents.

Burn Units. Burn wounds can provide optimal conditions for colonization, infection, and transmission of pathogens; infection acquired by burn patients is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. 319, 338, 339 The risk of invasive burn wound infection is particularly high in patients with a burn injury involving . 30% of the total body surface area (TBSA). 340, 341 Infections occurring in patients with burn injuries involving , 30% of the TBSA are usually associated with the use of invasive devices. MSSA, MRSA, enterococci (including VRE), gram-negative bacteria, and Candida spp are prevalent pathogens in burn infections, 53, 339, [342] [343] [344] [345] [346] [347] [348] [349] and outbreaks of these organisms have been reported. [350] [351] [352] [353] Shifts over time in the predominance of pathogens causing infections in burn patients often lead to changes in burn care practices. 342, [354] [355] [356] [357] Burn wound infections caused by Aspergillus spp or other environmental molds may result from exposure to supplies contaminated during construction 358 or to dust generated during construction or other environmental disruption. 359 Hydrotherapy equipment is an important environmental reservoir of gram-negative organisms. Its use in burn care is discouraged based on demonstrated associations between the use of contaminated hydrotherapy equipment and infections. Burn wound infections and colonization, as well as bloodstream infections, caused by multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa, 360 Acinetobacter baumannii, 361 and MRSA 351 have been associated with hydrotherapy; thus, excision of burn wounds in operating rooms is the preferred approach.",

Other advances have included prophylactic antimicrobial use, selective digestive decontamination, and use of antimicrobial-coated catheters; however, few epidemiologic studies and no efficacy studies have been performed to investigate the relative benefit of these measures. 356 There is no consensus on the most effective infection control practices to prevent transmission of infections to and from patients with serious burns (eg, single-bed rooms, 357 laminar flow, 362 and high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filtration, 359 or maintaining burn patients in a separate unit with no exposure to patients or equipment from other units 363 ). There also is controversy regarding the need for and type of barrier precautions in the routine care of burn patients. One retrospective study demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a simplified barrier isolation protocol for wound colonization, emphasizing handwashing and use of gloves, caps, masks, and impermeable plastic aprons (rather than isolation gowns) for direct patient contact. 364 However, to date no studies have determined the most effective combination of infection control precautions for use in burn settings. Prospective studies in this area are needed.",

Such practices and behaviors as congregation of children in play areas where toys and bodily secretions are easily shared and rooming-in of family members with pediatric patients can further increase the risk of transmission. Pathogenic bacteria have been recovered from toys used by hospitalized patients; 378 contaminated bath toys were implicated in an outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa on a pediatric oncology unit. 80 In addition, several patient factors increase the likelihood that infection will result from exposure to pathogens in health care settings (eg, immaturity of the neonatal immune system, lack of previous natural infection and resulting immunity, prevalence of patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, congenital anatomic anomalies, and use of life-saving invasive devices in NICUs and PICUs). 63 There are theoretical concerns that infection risk will increase in association with innovative practices used in the NICU for the purpose of improving developmental outcomes, Such factors include cobedding 379 and kangaroo care, 380 which may increase opportunity for skin-to-skin exposure of multiple gestation infants to each other and to their mothers, respectively; although the risk of infection actually may be reduced among infants receiving kangaroo care. 381 Children who attend child care centers 382, 383 and pediatric rehabilitation units 384 may increase the overall burden of antimicrobial resistance by contributing to the reservoir of CA-MRSA.

Health care is provided in various settings outside of hospitals, including long-term care facilities (LTCFs) (eg nursing homes), homes for the developmentally disabled, behavioral health service settings, rehabilitation centers, and hospices. 391 In addition, health care may be provided in non-health care settings, such as workplaces with occupational health clinics, adult day care centers, assisted-living facilities, homeless shelters, jails and prisons, school clinics, and infirmaries. Each of these settings has unique circumstances and population risks that must be considered when designing and implementing an infection control program.

The designation LTCF applies to a diverse group of residential settings, ranging from institutions for the developmentally disabled to nursing homes for the elderly and pediatric chronic care facilities. [392] [393] [394] Nursing homes for the elderly predominate numerically and frequently represent longterm care as a group of facilities. Approximately 1.8 million Americans reside in the nation's 16,500 nursing homes. 395 Estimates of HAI rates of 1.8 to 13.5 per 1000 resident-care days have been reported, with a range of 3 to 7 per 1000 resident-care days in the more rigorous studies. [396] [397] [398] [399] [400] The infrastructure described in the Department of Veterans Affairs' nursing home care units is a promising example for the development of a nationwide HAI surveillance system for LTCFs. 401 LCTFs are different from other health care settings in that elderly patients at increased risk for infection are brought together in one setting and remain in the facility for extended periods; for most residents, it is their home. An atmosphere of community is fostered, and residents share common eating and living areas and participate in various facility-sponsored activities. 402, 403 Because able residents interact freely with each other, controlling infection transmission in this setting can be challenging. 404 A residents who is colonized or infected with certain microorganisms are in some cases restricted to his or her room. However, because of the psychosocial risks associated with such restriction, balancing psychosocial needs with infection control needs is important in the LTCF setting. 405 274, 277, 278, 280 ) and bacteria, including group A streptococcus, 162 , B pertussis, 414 nonsusceptible S pneumoniae, 197, 198 other MDROs, and C difficile 415 ). These pathogens can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality, as well as increased medical costs; prompt detection and implementation of effective control measures are needed.",

Immobility, incontinence, dysphagia, underlying chronic diseases, poor functional status, and age-related skin changes increase susceptibility to urinary, respiratory, and cutaneous and soft tissue infections, whereas malnutrition can impair wound healing. [418] [419] [420] [421] [422] Medications (eg, drugs that affect level of consciousness, immune function, gastric acid secretions, and normal flora, including antimicrobial therapy) and invasive devices (eg, urinary catheters and feeding tubes) heighten the susceptibility to infection and colonization in LTCF residents. [423] [424] [425] Finally, limited functional status and total dependence on HCWs for activities of daily living have been identified as independent risk factors for infection 400, 416, 426 and for colonization with MRSA 427,428 and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. 429 Several position papers and review articles provide guidance on various aspects of infection control and antimicrobial resistance in LTCFs. [405] [406] [407] [430] [431] [432] [433] [434] [435] The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has established regulations for the prevention of infection in LTCFs. 436 Because residents of LTCFs are hospitalized frequently, they can transfer pathogens between LTCFs and health care facilities in which they receive care. 8, [437] [438] [439] [440] This also is true for pediatric long-term care populations. Pediatric chronic care facilities have been associated with the importation of extendedspectrum cephalosporin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli into a PICU. 50 Children from pediatric rehabilitation units may contribute to the reservoir of community-associated MRSA. 384, [388] [389] [390] I.D.2.b. Ambulatory Care. Over the past decade, health care delivery in the United States has shifted from the acute, inpatient hospital to various ambulatory and community-based settings, including the home. Ambulatory care is provided in hospital-based outpatient clinics, nonhospital-based clinics and physicians' offices, public health clinics, free-standing dialysis centers, ambulatory surgical centers, urgent care centers, and other setting. In 2000, there were 83 million visits to hospital outpatient clinics and more than 823 million visits to physicians' offices; 441 ambulatory care now accounts for most patient encounters with the health care system. 442 Adapting transmission prevention guidelines to these settings is challenging, because patients remain in common areas for prolonged periods waiting to be seen by a health care provider or awaiting admission to the hospital, examination or treatment rooms are turned around quickly with limited cleaning, and infectious patients may not be recognized immediately. Furthermore, immunocompromised patients often receive chemotherapy in infusion rooms, where they stay for extended periods along with other types of patients.",

            "text": "Little data exist on the risk of HAIs in ambulatory care settings, with the exception of hemodialysis centers. 18, 443, 444 Transmission of infections in outpatient settings has been reviewed in 3 studies. [445] [446] [447] Goodman and Solomon 445 summarized 53 clusters of infections associated with the outpatient setting between 1961 and 1990. Overall, 29 clusters were associated with common source transmission from contaminated solutions or equipment, 14 were associated with person-to-person transmission from or involving HCWs, and 10 were associated with airborne or droplet transmission among patients and health care workers. Transmission of bloodborne pathogens (ie, HBV, HCV, and, rarely, HIV) in outbreaks, sometimes involving hundreds of patients, continues to occur in ambulatory settings. These outbreaks often are related to common source exposures, usually a contaminated medical device, multidose vial, or intravenous solution. 82, [448] [449] [450] [451] [452] In all cases, transmission has been attributed to failure to adhere to fundamental infection control principles, including safe injection practices and aseptic technique. This subject has been reviewed, and recommended infection control and safe injection practices have been summarized. 453 Airborne transmission of M tuberculosis and measles in ambulatory settings, most often emergency departments, has been reported. 34, 127, 445, 447, [454] [455] [456] Measles virus was transmitted in physicians' offices and other outpatient settings during an era when immunization rates were low and measles outbreaks in the community were occurring regularly. 34, 122, 457 Rubella has been transmitted in the outpatient obstetric setting; 33 there are no published reports of varicella transmission in the outpatient setting. In the ophthalmology setting, adenovirus type 8 epidemic keratoconjunctivitis has been transmitted through incompletely disinfected ophthalmology equipment and/or from HCWs to patients, presumably by contaminated hands. 17, 445, 447, [458] [459] [460] [461] Preventing transmission in outpatient settings necessitates screening for potentially infectious symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, especially those at possible risk for transmitting airborne infectious agents (eg, M tuberculosis, varicella-zoster virus, rubeola [measles]), at the start of the initial patient encounter. On identification of a potentially infectious patient, implementation of prevention measures, including prompt separation of potentially infectious patients and implementation of appropriate control measures (eg, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette and Transmission-Based Precautions) can decrease transmission risks. 9, 12 Transmission of MRSA and VRE in outpatient settings has not been reported, but the association of CA-MRSA in HCWs working in an outpatient HIV clinic with environmental CA-MRSA contamination in that clinic suggests the possibility of transmission in that setting. 462 Patient-to-patient transmission of Burkholderia spp and P aeruginosa in outpatient clinics for adults and children with cystic fibrosis has been confirmed. 463, 464 I.D.2.c. Home Care. Home care in the United States is delivered by more than 20,000 provider agencies, including home health agencies, hospices, durable medical equipment providers, home infusion therapy services, and personal care and support services providers. Home care is provided to patients of all ages with both acute and chronic conditions. The scope of services ranges from assistance with activities of daily living and physical and occupational therapy to the care of wounds, infusion therapy, and chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.",

            "text": "The incidence of infection in home care patients, other than that associated with infusion therapy, has not been well studied. [465] [466] [467] [468] [469] [470] However, data collection and calculation of infection rates have been done for central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections in patients receiving home infusion therapy [469] [470] [471] [472] [473] and for the risk of blood contact through percutaneous or mucosal exposures, demonstrating that surveillance can be performed in this setting. 474 Draft definitions for home care-associated infections have been developed. 475 Transmission risks during home care are presumed to be minimal. The main transmission risks to home care patients are from an infectious home care provider or contaminated equipment; a provider also can be exposed to an infectious patient during home visits. Because home care involves patient care by a limited number of personnel in settings without multiple patients or shared equipment, the potential reservoir of pathogens is reduced. Infections of home care providers that could pose a risk to home care patients include infections transmitted by the airborne or droplet routes (eg, chickenpox, tuberculosis, influenza), skin infestations (eg, scabies 69 and lice), and infections transmitted by direct or indirect contact (eg, impetigo). There are no published data on indirect transmission of MDROs from one home care patient to another, although this is theoretically possible if contaminated equipment is transported from an infected or colonized patient and used on another patient. Of note, investigations of the first case of VISA in home care 186 and the first 2 reported cases of VRSA 178, 180, 181, 183 found no evidence of transmission of VISA or VRSA to other home care recipients. Home health care also may contribute to antimicrobial resistance; a review of outpatient vancomycin use found that 39% of recipients did not receive prescribed antibiotics according to recommended guidelines. 476 Although most home care agencies implement policies and procedures aimed at preventing transmission of organisms, the current approach is based on the adaptation of the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals, 1 as well as other professional guidance. 477, 478 This issue has proven very challenging to the home care industry, and practice has been inconsistent and frequently not evidence-based. For example, many home health agencies continue to observe ''nursing bag technique,'' a practice that prescribes the use of barriers between the nursing bag and environmental surfaces in the home. 479 Although the home environment may not always appear clean, the use of barriers between 2 noncritical surfaces has been questioned. 480, 481 Opportunites exist to conduct research in home care related to infection transmission risks. 482 I.D.2.d. Other Sites of Health Care Delivery. Facilities that are not primarily health care settings but in which health care is delivered include clinics in correctional facilities and shelters. Both of these settings can have suboptimal features, such as crowded conditions and poor ventilation. Economically disadvantaged individuals who may have chronic illnesses and health care problems related to alcoholism, injected drug use, poor nutrition, and/or inadequate shelter often receive their primary health care at such sites. 483 Infectious diseases of special concern for transmission include tuberculosis, scabies, respiratory infections (eg, N meningitides, S pneumoniae), sexually transmitted and bloodborne diseases (eg, HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, gonorrhea), hepatitis A virus, diarrheal agents such as norovirus, and foodborne diseases. 285, [484] [485] [486] [487] A high index of suspicion for tuberculosis and CA-MRSA in these populations is needed; outbreaks in these settings or among the populations they serve have been reported. [488] [489] [490] [491] [492] [493] [494] [495] [496] Patient encounters in these types of facilities provide an opportunity to deliver recommended immunizations and screen for M tuberculosis infection, along with diagnosing and treating acute illnesses. 497 Recommended infection control measures in these nontraditional areas designated for health care delivery are the same as for other ambulatory care settings. Therefore, these settings must be equipped to observe Standard Precautions and, when indicated, Transmission-Based Precautions.",

            "text": "I.E.1. Immunocompromised Patients. Patients who have congenital primary immune deficiencies or acquired disease (eg. treatment-induced immune deficiencies) are at increased risk for numerous types of infections while receiving health care; these patients may be located throughout the health care facility. The specific immune system defects determine the types of infections most likely to be acquired (eg, viral infections are associated with T cell defects, and fungal and bacterial infections occur in patients who are neutropenic). As a general group, immunocompromised patients can be cared for in the same environment as other patients; however, it is always advisable to minimize exposure to other patients with transmissible infections, such as influenza and other respiratory viruses. 498, 499 The use of more intense chemotherapy regimens for treatment of childhood leukemia may be associated with prolonged periods of neutropenia and suppression of other components of the immune system, extending the period of infection risk and raising the concern that additional precautions may be indicated for select groups. 500, 501 With the application of newer and more intense immunosuppressive therapies for various medical conditions (eg, rheumatologic disease, 502, 503 inflammatory bowel disease 504 ), immunosuppressed patients are likely to be more widely distributed throughout a health care facility rather than localized to single patient units (eg, hematologyoncology). Guidelines for preventing infections in certain groups of immunocompromised patients have been published previously. 15, 505, 506 Published data provide evidence to support placing patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT in a PE. 15, 157, 158 In addition, guidelines have been developed that address the special requirements of these immunocompromised patients, including use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and engineering controls to create a PE for the prevention of infections caused by Aspergillus spp and other environmental fungi. 11, 14, 15 As more intense chemotherapy regimens associated with prolonged periods of neutropenia or graft-versus-host disease are implemented, the period of risk and duration of environmental protection may need to be prolonged beyond the traditional 100 days. 507 I.E.2. Cystic Fibrosis Patients. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) require special consideration when developing infection control guidelines. Compared with other patients, CF patients require additional protection to prevent transmission from contaminated respiratory therapy equipment. [508] [509] [510] [511] [512] Such infectious agents as B cepacia complex and P aeruginosa. 463, 464, 513, 514 have unique clinical and prognostic significance. In CF patients, B cepacia infection has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, [515] [516] [517] whereas delayed acquisition of chronic P aeruginosa infection may be associated with an improved long-term clinical outcome. 518, 519 Person-to-person transmission of B cepacia complex has been demonstrated among children 516 and adults 520 with CF in health care settings 463, 521 and from various social contacts, 522 most notably attendance at camps for patients with CF 523 and among siblings with CF. 524 Successful infection control measures used to prevent transmission of respiratory secretions include segregation of CF patients from each other in ambulatory and hospital settings (including use of private rooms with separate showers), environmental decontamination of surfaces and equipment contaminated with respiratory secretions, elimination of group chest physiotherapy sessions, and disbanding of CF camps. 97, 525 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has published a consensus document with evidence-based recommendations for infection control practices in CF patients. 20 I.F. New Therapies Associated With Potentially Transmissible Infectious Agents I.F.1. Gene Therapy. Gene therapy has has been attempted using various viral vectors, including nonreplicating retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and replication-competent strains of poxviruses.

            "text": "Since the publication of that landmark study, responsibilities of ICPs have expanded commensurate with the growing complexity of the health care system, the patient populations served, and the increasing numbers of medical procedures and devices used in all types of health care settings. The scope of work of ICPs was first assessed in 1982 566-568 by the Certification Board of Infection Control, and has been reassessed every 5 years since that time. 557, [569] [570] [571] The findings of these analyses have been used to develop and update the Infection Control Certification Examination, which was first offered in 1983. With each new survey, it becomes increasingly apparent that the role of the ICP is growing in complexity and scope beyond traditional infection control activities in acute care hospitals. Activities currently assigned to ICPs in response to emerging challenges include (1) surveillance and infection prevention at facilities other than acute care hospitals (eg, ambulatory clinics, day surgery centers, LTCFs, rehabilitation centers, home care); (2) oversight of employee health services related to infection prevention (eg, assessment of risk and administration of recommended treatment after exposure to infectious agents, tuberculosis screening, influenza vaccination, respiratory protection fit testing, and administration of other vaccines as indicated, such as smallpox vaccine in 2003); (3) preparedness planning for annual influenza outbreaks, pandemic influenza, SARS, and bioweapons attacks; (4) adherence monitoring for selected infection control practices; (5) oversight of risk assessment and implementation of prevention measures associated with construction and renovation; (6) prevention of transmission of MDROs; (7) evaluation of new medical products that could be associated with increased infection risk (eg, intravenous infusion materials); (8) communication with the public, facility staff, and state and local health departments concerning infection control-related issues; and (9) participation in local and multicenter research projects. 433, 548, 551, 557, 572, 573 None of the Certification Board of Infection Control job analyses addressed specific staffing requirements for the identified tasks, although the surveys did include information about hours worked; the 2001 survey included the number of ICPs assigned to the responding facilities. 557 There is agreement in the literature that a ratio of 1 ICP per 250 acute care beds is no longer adequate to meet current infection control needs; a Delphi project that assessed staffing needs of infection control programs in the 21 st century concluded that a ratio of 0.8 to 1.0 ICP per 100 occupied acute care beds is an appropriate staffing level. 551 A survey of participants in the NNIS system found an average daily patient census of 115 per ICP. 315 Results of other studies have been similar: 3 per 500 beds for large acute care hospitals, 1 per 150 to 250 beds in LTCFs, and 1.56 per 250 in small rural hospitals. 572, 574 The foregoing demonstrates that infection control staffing no longer can be based on patient census alone, but rather must be determined by the scope of the program, characteristics of the patient population, complexity of the health care system, tools available to assist personnel to perform essential tasks (eg, electronic tracking and laboratory support for surveillance), and unique or urgent needs of the institution and community. 551 Furthermore, appropriate training is required to optimize the quality of work performed. 557, 571, 575 II.A.1.a.i. Infection Control Nurse Liaison. Designating a bedside nurse on a patient care unit as an infection control liaison or ''link nurse'' is reported to be an effective adjunct to enhance infection control at the unit level. [576] [577] [578] [579] [580] [581] Such individuals receive training in basic infection control and have frequent communication with ICPs, but maintain their primary role as bedside caregiver on their units. The infection control nurse liaison increases the awareness of infection control at the unit level. He or she is especially effective in implementating new policies or control interventions because of the rapport with individuals on the unit, an understanding of unit-specific challenges, and ability to promote strategies that are most likely to be successful in that unit. This position is an adjunct to, not a replacement for, fully trained ICPs. Furthermore, the infection control liaison nurses should not be counted when considering ICP staffing.",

In 2 studies, 589,595 the composition of the nursing staff (''pool'' or ''float'' vs regular staff nurses) influenced the rate of primary bloodstream infections, with an increased infection rate occurring when the proportion of regular nurses decreased and that of pool nurses increased. II.A.1.c. Clinical Microbiology Laboratory Support. The critical role of the clinical microbiology laboratory in infection control and health care epidemiology has been well described 552, 553, [597] [598] [599] and is supported by the Infectious Disease Society of America's policy statement on the consolidation of clinical microbiology laboratories published in 2001. 552 The clinical microbiology laboratory contributes to preventing transmission of infectious diseases in health care settings by promptly detecting and reporting epidemiologically important organisms, identifying emerging patterns of antimicrobial resistance, and assessing the effectiveness of recommended precautions to limit transmission during outbreaks. 597 Outbreaks of infections may be recognized first by laboratorians. 161 Health care organizations need to ensure the availability of the recommended scope and quality of laboratory services, a sufficient number of appropriately trained laboratory staff members, and systems to promptly communicate epidemiologically important results to those who will take action (eg, providers of clinical care, infection control staff, health care epidemiologists, and infectious disease consultants). 600 As concerns about emerging pathogens and bioterrorism grow, the role of the clinical microbiology laboratory assumes ever-greater importance. For health care organizations that outsource microbiology laboratory services (eg, ambulatory care, home care, LTCFs, smaller acute care hospitals), it is important to specify by contract the types of services (eg, periodic institution-specific aggregate susceptibility reports) required to support infection control.",

            "text": "Several key functions of the clinical microbiology laboratory are relevant to this guideline: II.A.2. Institutional Safety Culture and Organizational Characteristics. Safety culture (or safety climate) refers to a work environment in which a shared commitment to safety on the part of management and the workforce is understood and maintained. 558, 619, 620 The authors of the Institute of Medicine's report titled To Err is Human 542 acknowledged that causes of medical error are multifaceted but emphasized the pivotal role of system failures and the benefits of a safety culture. A safety culture is created through (1) the actions that management takes to improve patient and worker safety, (2) worker participation in safety planning, (3) the availability of appropriate PPE, (4) the influence of group norms regarding acceptable safety practices, and (5) the organization's socialization process for new personnel. Safety and patient outcomes can be enhanced by improving or creating organizational characteristics within patient care units, as demonstrated by studies of surgical ICUs. 621, 622 Each of these factors has a direct bearing on adherence to transmission prevention recommendations. 256 Measurement of an institution's culture of safety is useful in designing improvements in health care. 623, 624 Several hospitalbased studies have linked measures of safety culture with both employee adherence to safe practices and reduced exposures to blood and body fluids. [625] [626] [627] [628] [629] [630] [631] One study of hand hygiene practices concluded that improved adherence requires integration of infection control into the organization's safety culture. 560 Several hospitals that are part of the Veterans Administration health care system have taken specific steps toward improving the safety culture, including error-reporting mechanisms, root cause analyses of identified problems, safety incentives, and employee education. [632] [633] [634] II.A.3. Adherence of Health Care Workers to Recommended Guidelines. HCWs' adherence to recommended infection control practices decreases the transmission of infectious agents in health care settings. 116, 561, [635] [636] [637] [638] [639] Several observational studies have shown limited adherence to recommended practices by HCWs. 558, [639] [640] [641] [642] [643] [644] [645] [646] [647] [648] [649] [650] [651] [652] [653] [654] [655] [656] Observed adherence to universal precautions ranged from 43% to 89%. 640, 641, 648, 650, 651 The degree of adherence often depended on the specific practice that was assessed and, for glove use, the circumstance in which the practice was applied. Observed rates of appropriate glove use has ranged from a low of 15% 644 to a high of 82%. 649 However, 92% and 98% adherence with glove use have been reported during arterial blood gas collection and resuscitation, respectively, procedures in which considerable blood contact may occur. 642, 655 Differences in observed adherence have been reported among occupational groups in the same health care facility 640 and between experienced and nonexperienced professionals. 644 In surveys of HCWs, self-reported adherence was generally higher than actual adherence found in observational studies. Furthermore, where an observational component was included with a self-reported survey, self-perceived adherence was often greater than observed adherence. 656 Among nurses and physicians, increasing years of experience is a negative predictor of adherence. 644, 650 Education to improve adherence is the primary intervention that has been studied. Whereas positive changes in knowledge and attitude have been demonstrated, 639, 657 no or only limited accompanying changes in behavior often have been found. 641, 643 Self-reported adherence is higher in groups that received an educational intervention. 629, 658 In one study, educational interventions that incorporated videotaping and performance feedback were successful in improving adherence during the study period, but the long-term effect of such interventions is not known. 653 The use of videotaping also served to identify system problems (eg, communication and access to PPE) that otherwise may not have been recognized.",

Surveillance is defined as the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data regarding a health-related event for use in public health action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve health. 662 The work of Ignaz Semmelweis delineating the role of person-toperson transmission in puerperal sepsis is the earliest example of the use of surveillance data to reduce transmission of infectious agents. 663 Surveillance of both process measures and the infection rates to which they are linked is important in evaluating the effectiveness of infection prevention efforts and identifying indications for change. 554, [664] [665] [666] [667] The Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) found that different combinations of infection control practices resulted in reduced rates of nosocomial surgical site infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia in acute care hospitals; 565 however, surveillance was the only component essential for reducing all 4 types of HAIs. Although a similar study has not been conducted in other health care settings, a role for surveillance and the need for novel strategies in LTCFs 397, 433, 668, 669 and in home care [469] [470] [471] [472] have been described. The essential elements of a surveillance system are (1) standardized definitions, (2) identification of patient populations at risk for infection, (3) statistical analysis (eg, risk adjustment, calculation of rates using appropriate denominators, trend analysis using such methods as statistical process control charts), and (4) feedback of results to the primary caregivers. [670] [671] [672] [673] [674] [675] Data gathered through surveillance of high-risk populations, device use, procedures, and facility locations (eg, ICUs) are useful in detecting transmission trends. [670] [671] [672] Identification of clusters of infections should be followed by a systematic epidemiologic investigation to determine commonalities in persons, places, and time and to guide implementation of interventions and evaluation of the effectiveness of those interventions.",

            "text": "The education and training of HCWs is a prerequisite for ensuring that policies and procedures for Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are understood and practiced. Understanding the scientific rationale for the precautions will allow HCWs to apply procedures correctly, as well as to safely modify precautions based on changing requirements, resources, or health care settings. 14,654,680-687 One study found that the likelihood of HCWs developing SARS was strongly associated with less than 2 hours of infection control training and poor understanding of infection control procedures. 688 Education regarding the important role of vaccines (eg, influenza, measles, varicella, pertussis, pneumococcal) in protecting HCWs, their patients, and family members can help improve vaccination rates. [689] [690] [691] [692] Education on the principles and practices for preventing transmission of infectious agents should begin during training in the health professions and be provided to anyone who has an opportunity for contact with patients or medical equipment (eg, nursing and medical staff; therapists and technicians, including respiratory, physical, occupational, radiology, and cardiology personnel; phlebotomists; housekeeping and maintenance staff; and students). In health care facilities, education and training on Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions are typically provided at the time of orientation and should be repeated as necessary to maintain competency; updated education and training are necessary when policies and procedures are revised or when a special circumstance occurs, such as an outbreak that requires modification of current practice or adoption of new recommendations. Education and training materials and methods appropriate to the HCW's level of responsibility, individual learning habits, and language needs can improve the learning experience. 657, [693] [694] [695] [696] [697] [698] [699] [700] [701] Education programs for HCWs have been associated with sustained improvement in adherence to best practices and a related decrease in device-associated HAIs in teaching and nonteaching settings 638, 702 and in medical and surgical ICUs (Coopersmith, 2002 #2563) . Several studies have shown that in addition to targeted education to improve specific practices, periodic assessment and feedback of the HCW's knowledge and adherence to recommended practices are necessary to achieve the desired changes and identify continuing education needs. 561, [703] [704] [705] [706] [707] The effectiveness of this approach for isolation practices has been demonstrated in the control of RSV. 116, 683 Patients, family members, and visitors can be partners in preventing transmission of infections in health care settings. 9,42,708-710 Information on Standard Precautions, especially hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette, vaccination (especially against influenza), and other routine infection prevention strategies, may be incorporated into patient information materials provided on admission to the health care facility. Additional information on Transmission-Based Precautions is best provided when these precautions are initiated. Fact sheets, pamphlets, and other printed material may include information on the rationale for the additional precautions, risks to household members, room assignment for Transmission-Based Precautions purposes, explanation of the use of PPE by HCWs, and directions for use of such equipment by family members and visitors. Such information may be particularly helpful in the home environment, where household members often have the primary responsibility for adherence to recommended infection control practices. HCWs must be available and prepared to explain this material and answer questions as needed.",

            "text": "Hand hygiene has been frequently cited as the single most important practice to reduce the transmission of infectious agents in health care settings 558, 711, 712 and is an essential element of Standard Precautions. The term ''hand hygiene'' includes both handwashing with either plain or antiseptic-containing soap and water and the use of alcohol-based products (gels, rinses, foams) that do not require water. In the absence of visible soiling of hands, approved alcohol-based products for hand disinfection are preferred over antimicrobial or plain soap and water because of their superior microbiocidal activity, reduced drying of the skin, and convenience. 558 have been associated with a sustained decrease in the incidence of MRSA and VRE infections primarily in ICUs. 560, 561, [713] [714] [715] [716] The scientific rationale, indications, methods, and products for hand hygiene have been summarized in previous publications. 558, 716 The effectiveness of hand hygiene can be reduced by the type and length of fingernails. 558, 717, 718 Individuals wearing artificial nails have been shown to harbor more pathogenic organisms, especially gram-negative bacilli and yeasts, on the nails and in the subungual area compared with individuals with native nails. 719, 720 In 2002, the CDC/HICPAC recommended (Category IA) that artificial fingernails and extenders not be worn by HCWs who have contact with high-risk patients (eg, those in ICUs and operating rooms), due to the association with outbreaks of gram-negative bacillus and candidal infections as confirmed by molecular typing of isolates. 30, 31, 558, [721] [722] [723] [724] The need to restrict the wearing of artificial fingernails by all HCWs who provide direct patient care and those who have contact with other high-risk groups (eg, oncology and cystic fibrosis patients) has not been studied but has been recommended by some experts. 20 Currently, such decisions are at the discretion of an individual facility's infection control program. There is less evidence indicating that jewelry affects the quality of hand hygiene. Although hand contamination with potential pathogens is increased with ring-wearing, 558, 725 no studies have related this practice to HCW-to-patient transmission of pathogens.",

Gloves are used to prevent contamination of HCW hands when (1) anticipating direct contact with blood or body fluids, mucous membranes, nonintact skin and other potentially infectious material; (2) having direct contact with patients who are colonized or infected with pathogens transmitted by the contact route (eg, VRE, MRSA, RSV 558, 726, 727 ); or (3) handling or touching visibly or potentially contaminated patient care equipment and environmental surfaces. 72, 73, 558 Gloves can protect both patients and HCWs from exposure to infectious material that may be carried on hands. 73 The extent to which gloves will protect HCWs from transmission of bloodborne pathogens (eg, HIV, HBV, HCV) after a needlestick or other puncture that penetrates the glove barrier has not yet been determined. Although gloves may reduce the volume of blood on the external surface of a sharp by 46% to 86%, 728 the residual blood in the lumen of a hollow-bore needle would not be affected; therefore, the effect on transmission risk is unknown.",

            "text": "Gloves manufactured for health care purposes are subject to FDA evaluation and clearance. 729 Nonsterile disposable medical gloves made of various materials (eg, latex, vinyl, nitrile) are available for routine patient care. 730 The selection of glove type for nonsurgical use is based on various factors, including the task to be performed, anticipated contact with chemicals and chemotherapeutic agents, latex sensitivity, sizing, and facility policies for creating a latex-free environment. 17, [731] [732] [733] For contact with blood and body fluids during nonsurgical patient care, a single pair of gloves generally provides adequate barrier protection. 733 However, there is considerable variability among gloves; both the quality of the manufacturing process and type of material influence their barrier effectiveness. 734 Whereas there is little difference in the barrier properties of unused intact gloves, 735 studies have shown repeatedly that vinyl gloves have higher failure rates than latex or nitrile gloves when tested under simulated and actual clinical conditions. 730, [734] [735] [736] [737] For this reason, either latex or nitrile gloves are preferable for clinical procedures that require manual dexterity or will involve more than brief patient contact. A facility may need to stock gloves in several sizes. Heavier, reusable utility gloves are indicated for non-patient care activities, such as handling or cleaning contaminated equipment or surfaces. 11, 14, 738 During patient care, transmission of infectious organisms can be reduced by adhering to the principles of working from ''clean'' to ''dirty'' and confining or limiting contamination to those surfaces directly needed for patient care. It may be necessary to change gloves during the care of a single patient to prevent cross-contamination of body sites. 558, 739 It also may be necessary to change gloves if the patient interaction also involves touching portable computer keyboards or other mobile equipment transported from room to room. Discarding gloves between patients is necessary to prevent transmission of infectious material. Gloves must not be washed for subsequent reuse, because microorganisms cannot be removed reliably from glove surfaces, and continued glove integrity cannot be ensured. Furthermore, glove reuse has been associated with transmission of MRSA and gram-negative bacilli. [740] [741] [742] When gloves are worn in combination with other PPE, they are put on last. Gloves that fit snugly around the wrist are preferred for use with an isolation gown, because they will cover the gown cuff and provide a more reliable continuous barrier for the arms, wrists, and hands. Proper glove removal will prevent hand contamination (Fig 1) . Hand hygiene after glove removal further ensures that the hands will not carry potentially infectious material that might have penetrated through unrecognized tears or that could have contaminated the hands during glove removal. 558, 727, 740 II.E.2. Isolation Gowns. Isolation gowns are used as specified by Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions to protect the HCW's arms and exposed body areas and prevent contamination of clothing with blood, body fluids, and other potentially infectious material. 24, 88, 261, [743] [744] [745] The need for and the type of isolation gown selected is based on the nature of the patient interaction, including the anticipated degree of contact with infectious material and potential for blood and body fluid penetration of the barrier. The wearing of isolation gowns and other protective apparel is mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. 738 Clinical and laboratory coats or jackets worn over personal clothing for comfort and/or purposes of identity are not considered PPE.",

Isolation gowns should be removed before leaving the patient care area to prevent possible contamination of the environment outside the patient's room.

Guidance on eye protection for infection control has been published. 758 The eye protection chosen for specific work situations (eg, goggles or face shield) depends on the circumstances of exposure, other PPE used, and personal vision needs. Personal eyeglasses and contact lenses are not considered adequate eye protection (see http://www.cdc.gov/ niosh/topics/eye/eye-infectious.html). NIOSH guidelines specify that eye protection must be comfortable, allow for sufficient peripheral vision, and adjustable to ensure a secure fit. A health care facility may need to provide several different types, styles, and sizes of eye protection equipment. Indirectly vented goggles with a manufacturer's antifog coating may provide the most reliable practical eye protection from splashes, sprays, and respiratory droplets from multiple angles. Newer styles of goggles may provide better indirect airflow properties to reduce fogging, as well as better peripheral vision and more size options for fitting goggles to different workers. Many styles of goggles fit adequately over prescription glasses with minimal gaps. Although effective as eye protection, goggles do not provide splash or spray protection to other parts of the face.",

            "text": "II.E.4. Respiratory Protection. The subject of respiratory protection as it applies to preventing transmission of airborne infectious agents, including the need for and frequency of fit testing is under scientific review and was the subject of a 2004 CDC workshop. 762 Respiratory protection currently requires the use of a respirator with N95 or higher-level filtration to prevent inhalation of infectious particles. Information about respirators and respiratory protection programs is summarized in the Guideline for Preventing Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health Care Settings. 12 Respiratory protection is broadly regulated by OSHA under the general industry standard for respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910 .134), 763 which requires that US employers in all employment settings implement a program to protect employees from inhalation of toxic materials. OSHA program components include medical clearance to wear a respirator; provision and use of appropriate respirators, including fit-tested NIOSH-certified N95 and higher-level particulate filtering respirators; education on respirator use, and periodic reevaluation of the respiratory protection program. When selecting particulate respirators, models with inherently good fit characteristics (ie, those expected to provide protection factors of $ 10% to 95% of wearers) are preferred and theoretically could preclude the need for fit testing. 764, 765 Issues pertaining to respiratory protection remain the subject of ongoing debate. Information on various types of respirators is available at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ npptl/respirators/respsars.html and in several previously published studies. 764, 766, 767 A user-seal check (formerly called a ''fit check'') should be performed by the wearer of a respirator each time that the respirator is donned, to minimize air leakage around the face piece. 768 The optimal frequency of fit testing has not been determined; retesting may be indicated if there is a change in wearer's facial features, onset of a medical condition that would affect respiratory function in the wearer, or a change in the model or size of the respirator that was initially assigned. 12 Respiratory protection was first recommended for protection of US HCWs from exposure to M tuberculosis in 1989. That recommendation has been maintained in 2 successive revisions of the Guidelines for Prevention of Transmission of Tuberculosis in Hospitals and Other Health Care Settings. 12, 126 The incremental benefit from respirator use, in addition to administrative and engineering controls (ie, AIIRs, early recognition of patients likely to have tuberculosis and prompt placement in an AIIR, and maintenance of a patient with suspected tuberculosis in an AIIR until no longer infectious), for preventing transmission of airborne infectious agents (eg, M tuberculosis) remains undetermined. Although some studies have demonstrated effective prevention of M tuberculosis transmission in hospitals in which surgical masks instead of respirators were used in conjunction with other administrative and engineering controls. 636, 769, 770 the CDC currently recommends N95 or higher-level respirators for personnel exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. Currently, this recommendation also holds for other diseases that could be transmitted through the airborne route, including SARS 261 and smallpox, 108,129,771 until inhalational transmission is better defined or health care-specific PPE more suitable for preventing infection is developed. Wearing of respirators is also currently recommended during the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (eg, intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning) in patients with SARS-CoV infection, avian influenza, and pandemic influenza (see Appendix A).",

These measures apply to routine patient care and do not address the prevention of sharps injuries and other blood exposures during surgical and other invasive procedures addressed elsewhere.

This has included focusing attention on removing sharps hazards through the development and use of engineering controls. The federal Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, signed into law in November 2000, authorized OSHA's revision of its Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to more explicitly require the use of safety-engineered sharps devices. 785 The CDC has provided guidance on sharps injury prevention, 786,787 including guidelines for the design, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive sharps injury prevention program. 788 II.F.2.

These include keeping contaminated gloved and ungloved hands from touching the mouth, nose, eyes, or face and positioning patients to direct sprays and splatter away from the caregiver's face. Careful placement of PPE before patient contact will help avoid the need to make adjustments to PPE and prevent possible face or mucous membrane contamination during use.",

In the absence of continued transmission, it is not necessary to provide a private bathroom for patients colonized or infected with enteric pathogens as long as personal hygiene practices and Standard Precautions (especially hand hygiene and appropriate environmental cleaning) are maintained. Assignment of a dedicated commode to a patient, and cleaning and disinfecting fixtures and equipment that may have fecal contamination (eg, bathrooms, commodes, 797 scales used for weighing diapers) and the adjacent surfaces with appropriate agents may be especially important when a single-patient room cannot be assigned, because environmental contamination with intestinal tract pathogens is likely from both continent and incontinent patients. 54, 798 The results of several studies that investigated the benefit of a single-patient room in preventing transmission of C difficile were inconclusive. 167, [799] [800] [801] Some studies have shown that being in the same room with a colonized or infected patient is not necessarily a risk factor for transmission; 790,802-804 however, for children, the risk of health care-associated diarrhea is increased with the increased number of patients per room. 805 These findings demonstrate that patient factors are important determinants of infection transmission risks. The need for a single-patient room and/or private bathroom for any patient is best determined on a case-by-case basis.",

However, infections transmitted through the airborne route (eg, M tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox) require additional precautions. 12, 125, 828 Patients suspected of having such an infection can wear a surgical mask for source containment, if tolerated, and should be placed in an examination room (preferably an AIIR) as soon as possible. If this is not possible, then having the patient wear a mask and segregating the patient from other patients in the waiting area will reduce the risk of exposing others. Because the person(s) accompanying the patient also may be infectious, application of the same infection control precautions may be extended to these persons if they are symptomatic. 21, 251, 829 Family members accompanying children admitted with suspected M tuberculosis have been found to have unsuspected pulmonary tuberculosis with cavitary lesions, even when asymptomatic. 42, 830 Patients with underlying conditions that increase their susceptibility to infection (eg, immunocompromised status 43, 44 or cystic fibrosis 20 ) require special efforts to protect them from exposure to infected patients in common waiting areas. Informing the receptionist of their infection risk on arrival allows appropriate steps to further protect these patients from infection. In some cystic fibrosis clinics, to avoid exposure to other patients who could be colonized with B cepacia, patients have been given beepers on registration so that they may leave the area and receive notification to return when an examination room becomes available. 831 II.G.3. Home Care. In home care, patient placement concerns focus on protecting others in the home from exposure to an infectious household member. For individuals who are especially vulnerable to adverse outcomes associated with certain infections, it may be beneficial to either remove them from the home or segregate them within the home. Persons who are not part of the household may need to be prohibited from visiting during the period of infectivity. For example, in a situation where a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis is contagious and being cared for at home, very young children (age under 4 years) 832 and immunocompromised persons who have not yet been infected should be removed or excluded from the household. During the SARS outbreak of 2003, segregation of infected persons during the communicable phase of the illness was found to be beneficial in preventing household transmission. 249, 833 ",

In addition, increased frequency of cleaning may be needed in a PE to minimize dust accumulation. 11 Special recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting environmental surfaces in dialysis centers have been published previously. 18 In all health care settings, administrative, staffing, and scheduling activities should prioritize the proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces that could be implicated in transmission. During a suspected or proven outbreak in which an environmental reservoir is suspected, routine cleaning procedures should be reviewed, and the need for additional trained cleaning staff should be assessed.

This includes those pathogens that are resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents (eg, C difficile, VRE, MRSA, MDR-GNB 11, 24, 88, 434, 745, 795, 836 ). Most often, environmental reservoirs of pathogens during outbreaks are related to a failure to follow recommended procedures for cleaning and disinfection, rather than to the specific cleaning and disinfectant agents used. [837] [838] [839] [840] Certain pathogens (eg, rotavirus, noroviruses, C difficile) may be resistant to some routinely used hospital disinfectants. 274, 291, [841] [842] [843] [844] [845] [846] The role of specific disinfectants in limiting transmission of rotavirus has been demonstrated experimentally. 841 Also, because C difficile may display increased levels of spore production when exposed to non-chlorine-based cleaning agents, and because these spores are more resistant than vegetative cells to commonly used surface disinfectants, some investigators have recommended the use of a 1:10 dilution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) and water for routine environmental disinfection of rooms of patients with C difficile when there is continued transmission. 843, 847 One study found an association between the use of a hypochlorite solution and decreased rates of C difficile infections. 846 The need to change disinfectants based on the presence of these organisms can be determined in consultation with the infection control committee. 11, 846, 847 Detailed recommendations for disinfection and sterilization of surfaces and medical equipment that have been in contact with prion-containing tissue or high risk body fluids, and for cleaning of blood and body substance spills, are available in the Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health Care Facilities 11 and in the Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization. 847",

If a laundry chute is used, it must be maintained to minimize dispersion of aerosols from contaminated items. 11 Methods of handling, transporting, and laundering soiled textiles are determined by organizational policy and any applicable regulations; 738 guidance is provided in the Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health Care Facilities. 11 Rather than rigid rules and regulations, hygienic and common sense storage and processing of clean textiles is recommended. 11, 856 When laundering is done outside of a health care facility, the clean items must be packaged or completely covered and placed in an enclosed space during transport to prevent contamination with outside air or construction dust that could contain infectious fungal spores that pose a risk for immunocompromised patients. 11 Institutions are required to launder garments used as PPE and uniforms visibly soiled with blood or infective material. 738 Little data exist on the safety of home laundering of HCW uniforms, but no increase in infection rates was observed in the one published study, 857 and no pathogens were recovered from home-or hospital-laundered scrubs in another study. 858 In the home, textiles and laundry from patients with potentially transmissible infectious pathogens do not require special handling or separate laundering and may be washed with warm water and detergent. 11, 857, 858 ",

Infections for which postexposure chemoprophylaxis is recommended under defined conditions include B pertussis, 17,862 N meningitides, 863 B anthracis after environmental exposure to aeosolizable material, 864 influenza virus, 610 HIV, 865 and group A streptococcus. 160 Orally administered antimicrobials also may be used under defined circumstances for MRSA decolonization of patients or HCWs. 866 Another form of chemoprophylaxis involves the use of topical antiseptic agents. For example, triple dye is routinely used on the umbilical cords of term newborns to reduce the risk of colonization, skin infections, and omphalitis caused by S aureus, including MRSA, and group A streptococcus. 867, 868 Extension of the use of triple dye to low birth weight infants in a NICU was one component of a program that controlled a long-standing MRSA outbreak. 22 Topical antiseptics (eg, mupirocin) also are used for decolonization of HCWs or selected patients colonized with MRSA, as discussed in the MDRO guideline 866, [869] [870] [871] [872] II.N.2. Immunoprophylaxis. Certain immunizations recommended for susceptible HCWs have decreased the risk of infection and the potential for transmission in health care facilities. 17, 873 The OSHA mandate requiring employers to offer HBV vaccination to HCWs has played a substantial role in the sharp decline in incidence of occupational HBV infection. 777, 874 The routine administration of varicella vaccine to HCWs has decreased the need to place susceptible HCWs on administrative leave after exposure to patients with varicella. 774 In addition, reports of health care-associated transmission of rubella in obstetric clinics 33, 875 and measles in acute care settings 34 demonstrate the importance of immunization of susceptible HCWs against childhood diseases. Many states have requirements for vaccination of HCWs for measles and rubella in the absence of evidence of immunity. Annual influenza vaccine campaigns targeted at patients and HCWs in LTCFs and acute care settings have been instrumental in preventing or limiting institutional outbreaks; consequently, increasing attention is being directed toward improving influenza vaccination rates in HCWs. 35, 610, 689, [876] [877] [878] Transmission of B pertussis in health care facilities has been associated with large and costly outbreaks that include both HCWs and patients. 17, 36, 41, 100, 682, 826, 879, 880 HCWs in close contact with infants with pertussis are at particularly high risk because of waning immunity and, until 2005, the absence of a vaccine appropriate for adults. But 2 acellular pertussis vaccines were licensed in the United States in 2005, 1 for use in individuals age 11 to 18 years and the other for use in those age 10 to 64 years. 881 Current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices provisional recommendations include immunization of adolescents and adults, especially those in contact with infants under age 12 months and HCWs with direct patient contact. 882, 883 Immunization of children and adults will help prevent the introduction of vaccine-preventable diseases into health care settings. The recommended immunization schedule for children is published annually in the January issues of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, with interim updates as needed. 884, 885 An adult immunization schedule also is available for healthy adults and those with special immunization needs due to high-risk medical conditions. 886 Some vaccines are also used for postexposure prophylaxis of susceptible individuals, including varicella, 887 influenza, 610 hepatitis B, 777 and smallpox 225 vaccines. 17, 873 In the future, administration of a newly developed S aureus conjugate vaccine (still under investigation) to selected patients may provide a novel method of preventing health care-associated S aureus (including MRSA) infections in high-risk groups (eg, hemodialysis patients and candidates for selected surgical procedures). 888, 889 Immune globulin preparations also are used for postexposure prophylaxis of certain infectious agents under specified circumstances (eg, varicella-zoster virus, HBV, rabies, measles and hepatitis A virus 17, 832, 873 ). The RSV monoclonal antibody preparation palivizumab may have contributed to controlling a nosocomial outbreak of RSV in one NICU, but there is insufficient evidence to support a routine recommendation for its use in this setting. 890 II.N. 3 24, 43, 44, 372 and SARS 21, [252] [253] [254] . Effective methods for visitor screening in health care settings have not yet been studied, however. Visitor screening is especially important during community outbreaks of infectious diseases and for high-risk patient units. Sibling visits are often encouraged in birthing centers, postpartum rooms, pediatric inpatient units, PICUs, and residential settings for children; in hospital settings, a child visitor should visit only his or her own sibling. Screening of visiting siblings and other children before they are allowed into clinical areas is necessary to prevent the introduction of childhood illnesses and common respiratory infections. Screening may be passive, through the use of signs to alert family members and visitors with signs and symptoms of communicable diseases not to enter clinical areas. More active screening may include the completion of a screening tool or questionnaire to elicit information related to recent exposures or current symptoms. This information is reviewed by the facility staff, after which the visitor is either permitted to visit or is excluded. 832 Family and household members visiting pediatric patients with pertussis and tuberculosis may need to be screened for a history of exposure, as well as signs and symptoms of current infection. Potentially infectious visitors are excluded until they receive appropriate medical screening, diagnosis, or treatment. If exclusion is not considered to be in the best interest of the patient or family (ie, primary family members of critically or terminally ill patients), then the symptomatic visitor must wear a mask while in the health care facility and remain in the patient's room, avoiding exposure to others, especially in public waiting areas and the cafeteria.",

Standard Precautions are intended to be applied to the care of all patients in all health care settings, regardless of the suspected or confirmed presence of an infectious agent. Implementation of Standard Precautions constitutes the primary strategy for the prevention of health care-associated transmission of infectious agents among patients and HCWs. Transmission-Based Precautions are for patients who are known or suspected to be infected or colonized with infectious agents, including certain epidemiologically important pathogens, which require additional control measures to effectively prevent transmission. Because the infecting agent often is not known at the time of admission to a health care facility, Transmission-Based Precautions are used empirically, according to the clinical syndrome and the likely etiologic agents at the time, and then modified when the pathogen is identified or a transmissible infectious etiology is ruled out. Examples of this syndromic approach are presented in Table 2 . The HICPAC/CDC Guidelines also include recommendations for creating a Protective Environment for allogeneic HSCT patients.",

These include hand hygiene; use of gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; and safe injection practices. Also, equipment or items in the patient environment likely to have been contaminated with infectious body fluids must be handled in a manner to prevent transmission of infectious agents (eg, wear gloves for direct contact, contain heavily soiled equipment, properly clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable equipment before use on another patient).",

The strategy is targeted at patients and accompanying family members and friends with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections, and applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased production of respiratory secretions when entering a health care facility. 40, 41, 43 The term cough etiquette is derived from recommended source control measures for M tuberculosis. 12, 126 The elements of respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette include (1) education of health care facility staff, patients, and visitors; (2) posted signs, in language(s) appropriate to the population served, with instructions to patients and accompanying family members or friends; (3) source control measures (eg, covering the mouth/nose with a tissue when coughing and prompt disposal of used tissues, using surgical masks on the coughing person when tolerated and appropriate); (4) hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions; and (5) spatial separation, ideally .3 feet, of persons with respiratory infections in common waiting areas when possible. Covering sneezes and coughs and placing masks on coughing patients are proven means of source containment that prevent infected persons from dispersing respiratory secretions into the air. 107, 145, 897, 898 Masking may be difficult in some settings, (eg, pediatrics), in which case the emphasis by necessity may be on cough etiquette. 899 Physical proximity of , 3 feet has been associated with an increased risk for transmission of infections through the droplet route (eg, N meningitidis 103 and group A streptococcus 114 ) and thus supports the practice of distancing infected persons from others who are not infected. The effectiveness of good hygiene practices, especially hand hygiene, in preventing transmission of viruses and reducing the incidence of respiratory infections both within and outside [900] [901] [902] health care settings is summarized in several reviews. 558, 716, 903 These measures should be effective in decreasing the risk of transmission of pathogens contained in large respiratory droplets (eg, influenza virus, 23 adenovirus, 111 B pertussis, 826 and M pneumoniae 112 ). Although fever will be present in many respiratory infections, patients with pertussis and mild upper respiratory tract infections are often afebrile. Therefore, the absence of fever does not always exclude a respiratory infection.",

HCWs who have a respiratory infection are advised to avoid direct patient contact, especially with high-risk patients. If this is not possible, then a mask should be worn while providing patient care. III.A.1.b. Safe Injection Practices. The investigation of 4 large outbreaks of HBV and HCV among patients in ambulatory care facilities in the United States identified a need to define and reinforce safe injection practices. 452 The 4 outbreaks occurred in a private medical practice, a pain clinic, an endoscopy clinic, and a hematology/oncology clinic. The primary breaches in infection control practice that contributed to these outbreaks were reinsertion of used needles into a multiple-dose vial or solution container (eg, saline bag) and use of a single needle/syringe to administer intravenous medication to multiple patients. In 1 of these outbreaks, preparation of medications in the same workspace where used needle/syringes were dismantled also may have been a contributing factor. These and other outbreaks of viral hepatitis could have been prevented by adherence to basic principles of aseptic technique for the preparation and administration of parenteral medications. 452, 453 These include the use of a sterile, single-use, disposable needle and syringe for each injection given and prevention of contamination of injection equipment and medication. Whenever possible, use of single-dose vials is preferred over multiple-dose vials, especially when medications will be administered to multiple patients.",

            "text": "Outbreaks related to unsafe injection practices indicate that some HCWs are unaware of, do not understand, or do not adhere to basic principles of infection control and aseptic technique. A survey of US health care workers who provide medication through injection found that 1% to 3% reused the same needle and/or syringe on multiple patients. 904 Among the deficiencies identified in recent outbreaks were a lack of oversight of personnel and failure to follow up on reported breaches in infection control practices in ambulatory settings. Therefore, to ensure that all HCWs understand and adhere to recommended practices, principles of infection control and aseptic technique need to be reinforced in training programs and incorporated into institutional polices that are monitored for adherence. 453 III.A.1.c. Infection Control Practices for Special Lumbar Puncture Procedures. In 2004, the CDC investigated 8 cases of postmyelography meningitis that either were reported to the CDC or identified through a survey of the Emerging Infections Network of the Infectious Disease Society of America. Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid of all 8 cases yielded streptococcal species consistent with oropharyngeal flora and there were changes in the CSF indices and clinical status indicative of bacterial meningitis. Equipment and products used during these procedures (eg, contrast media) were excluded as probable sources of contamination. Procedural details available for 7 cases determined that antiseptic skin preparations and sterile gloves had been used. However, none of the clinicians wore a face mask, giving rise to the speculation that droplet transmission of oralpharyngeal flora was the most likely explanation for these infections. Bacterial meningitis after myelography and other spinal procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, spinal and epidural anesthesia, intrathecal chemotherapy) has been reported previously. [905] [906] [907] [908] [909] [910] [911] [912] [913] [914] As a result, the question of whether face masks should be worn to prevent droplet spread of oral flora during spinal procedures (eg, myelography, lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia) has been debated. 915, 916 Face masks are effective in limiting the dispersal of oropharyngeal droplets 917 and are recommended for the placement of central venous catheters. 918 In October 2005, HICPAC reviewed the evidence and concluded that there is sufficient experience to warrant the additional protection of a face mask for the individual placing a catheter or injecting material into the spinal or epidural space.",

Contact Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents, including epidemiologically important microorganisms, which are spread by direct or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment as described in Section I.B.3.a. The specific agents and circumstance for which Contact Precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A. The application of Contact Precautions for patients infected or colonized with MDROs is described in the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline. 926 Contact Precautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission. A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require Contact Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (eg, cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). In multipatient rooms, $ 3 feet spatial separation between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients. HCWs caring for patients on Contact Precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning PPE on room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (eg, VRE, C difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens, RSV). 54, 72, 73, 78, 273, 274, 739 III.B.2. Droplet Precautions. Droplet Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions as described in Section I.B.3.b. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a health care facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. Infectious agents for which Droplet Precautions are indicated are listed in Appendix A and include B pertussis, influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, N meningitides, and group A streptococcus (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy). A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require Droplet Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (eg, cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Spatial separation of $ 3 feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multibed rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. HCWs wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patient; the mask is generally donned on room entry. Patients on Droplet Precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette.",

Airborne Precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (eg, rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], M tuberculosis, and possibly SARS-CoV), as described in Section I.B.3.c and Appendix A. The preferred placement for patients who require Airborne Precautions is in an AIIR, a single-patient room equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the AIA/Facility Guidelines Institute standards for AIIRs (ie, monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area; 12 air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities; air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return). 12, 13 Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency departments, and nursing homes that care for patients with M tuberculosis. A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, fit testing, and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (eg, physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (eg, office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher-level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for HCWs will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. HCWs caring for patients on Airborne Precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations (see Section II.E.4, Table 2 , and Appendix A), that is donned before room entry. Whenever possible, nonimmune HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (eg, measles, chickenpox, smallpox).",

            "text": "Transmission-Based Precautions remain in effect for limited periods (ie, while the risk for transmission of the infectious agent persists or for the duration of the illness (see Appendix A). For most infectious diseases, this duration reflects known patterns of persistence and shedding of infectious agents associated with the natural history of the infectious process and its treatment. For some diseases (eg, pharyngeal or cutaneous diphtheria, RSV), Transmission-Based Precautions remain in effect until culture or antigen-detection test results document eradication of the pathogen and, for RSV, symptomatic disease is resolved. For other diseases (eg, M tuberculosis), state laws and regulations and health care facility policies may dictate the duration of precautions. 12 In immunocompromised patients, viral shedding can persist for prolonged periods of time (many weeks to months) and transmission to others may occur during that time; therefore, the duration of contact and/or droplet precautions may be prolonged for many weeks. 499, [927] [928] [929] [930] [931] [932] The duration of Contact Precautions for patients who are colonized or infected with MDROs remains undefined. MRSA is the only MDRO for which effective decolonization regimens are available. 866 However, carriers of MRSA who have negative nasal cultures after a course of systemic or topical therapy may resume shedding MRSA in the weeks after therapy. 933, 934 Although early guidelines for VRE suggested discontinuation of Contact Precautions after 3 stool cultures obtained at weekly intervals proved negative, 739 subsequent experiences have indicated that such screening may fail to detect colonization that can persist for . 1 year. 27, [935] [936] [937] Likewise, available data indicate that colonization with VRE, MRSA, 938 and possibly MDR-GNB can persist for many months, especially in the presence of severe underlying disease, invasive devices, and recurrent courses of antimicrobial agents.",

The latter is based on molecular typing studies that have found indistinguishable strains of Aspergillus terreus in patients with hematologic malignancies and in potted plants in the vicinity of the patients. [941] [942] [943] The desired quality of air may be achieved without incurring the inconvenience or expense of laminar airflow. 15, 157 To prevent inhalation of fungal spores during periods when construction, renovation, or other dust-generating activities that may be ongoing in and around the health care facility, it has been recommended that severely immunocompromised patients wear a high-efficiency respiratory protection device (eg, an N95 respirator) when they leave the PE. 11, 14, 944 The use of masks or respirators by HSCT patients when they are outside of the PE for prevention of environmental fungal infections in the absence of construction has not been evaluated. A PE does not include the use of barrier precautions beyond those indicated for Standard Precuations and Transmission-Based Precautions.

A device worn over the mouth and nose by operating room personnel during surgical procedures to protect both surgical patients and operating room personnel from transfer of microorganisms and body fluids. Surgical masks also are used to protect health care personnel from contact with large infectious droplets (. 5 mm in size). According to draft guidance issued by the Food and Drug Administration on May 15, 2003 , surgical masks are evaluated using standardized testing procedures for fluid resistance, bacterial filtration efficiency, differential pressure (air exchange), and flammability to mitigate the risks to health associated with the use of surgical masks. These specifications apply to any masks that are labeled surgical, laser, isolation, or dental or medical procedure (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/094.html#4). Surgical masks do not protect against inhalation of small particles or droplet nuclei and should not be confused with particulate respirators that are recommended for protection against selected airborne infectious agents (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis).

Several other HICPAC guidelines to prevent transmission of infectious agents associated with health care delivery are cited, including Guideline for Hand Hygiene, Guideline for Environmental Infection Control, Guideline for Prevention of Health Care-Associated Pneumonia, and Guideline for Infection Control in Health Care Personnel. 11,14,16,17 In combination, these provide comprehensive guidance on the primary infection control measures for ensuring a safe environment for patients and HCWs. This guideline does not discuss in detail specialized infection control issues in defined populations that are addressed elsewhere (eg, Recommendations for Preventing Transmission of Infections Among Chronic Hemodialysis Patients, Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health Care Facilities 2005, Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health Care Settings, and Infection Control Recommendations for Patients With Cystic Fibrosis. 12,18-20 An exception has been made by including abbreviated guidance for a PE used for allogeneic HSCT recipients, because components of the PE have been defined more completely since publication of the Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections Among HSCT Recipients in 2000 and the Guideline for Environmental Infection Control in Health Care Facilities. 11,15 I.B.

Several classes of pathogens can cause infection, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and prions. The modes of transmission vary by type of organism, and some infectious agents may be transmitted by more than 1 route. Some are transmitted primarily by direct or indirect contact, (eg, herpes simplex virus [HSV], respiratory syncytial virus, S aureus), others by the droplet, (eg, influenza virus, Bordetella pertussis) or airborne routes (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Other infectious agents, such as bloodborne viruses (eg, hepatitis B virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], HIV), are rarely transmitted in health care settings through percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure. Importantly, not all infectious agents are transmitted from person to person; these are listed in Appendix A. The 3 principal routes of transmission-contact, droplet, and airborne-are summarized below. I.B.3.a. Contact Transmission. The most common mode of transmission, contact transmission is divided into 2 subgroups: direct contact and indirect contact. I.B.3.a.i. Direct Contact Transmission. Direct transmission occurs when microorganisms are transferred from an infected person to another person without a contaminated intermediate object or person. Opportunities for direct contact transmission between patients and HCWs have been summarized in HICPAC's Guideline for Infection Control in Health Care Personnel, 1998 17 and include the following: d Blood or other blood-containing body fluids from a I.B.3.a.ii. Indirect Contact Transmission. Indirect transmission involves the transfer of an infectious agent through a contaminated intermediate object or person.In the absence of a point-source outbreak, it is difficult to determine how indirect transmission occurs. However, extensive evidence cited in the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health Care Settings suggests that the contaminated hands of HCWs are important contributors to indirect contact transmission.16 Examples of opportunities for indirect contact transmission include the following:",

Principle sources consulted for the development of disease-specific recommendations for the appendix included infectious disease manuals and textbooks. 831, 1039, 1040 The published literature was searched for evidence of person-to-person transmission in health care and non-health care settings with a focus on reported outbreaks that would assist in developing recommendations for all settings where health care is delivered. The following criteria were used to assign transmission-based precautions categories: d A transmission-based precautions category was assigned if there was strong evidence for person-to-person transmission via droplet, contact, or airborne routes in health care or non-health care settings and/or if patient factors (eg, diapered infants, diarrhea, draining wounds) increased the risk of transmission. d Transmission-based precautions category assignments reflect the predominant mode(s) of transmission. d If there was no evidence for person-to-person transmission by droplet, contact or airborne routes, then Standard Precautions were assigned. d If there was a low risk for person-to-person transmission and no evidence of health care-associated transmission, then Standard Precautions were assigned. d Standard precautions were assigned for bloodborne pathogens (eg, HBV, HCV, HIV) in accordance with CDC recommendations for universal precautions issued in 1988. 778 Subsequent experience has confirmed the efficacy of Standard Precautions to prevent exposure to infected blood and body fluid. 776, 777, 863 Additional information relevant to use of precautions was added in the comments column to assist the caregiver in decision-making.
