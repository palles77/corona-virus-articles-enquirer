Although virus-specific CTLs play a pivotal role to eliminate virus-infected cells, the potential role of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the infiltration of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs and the expression of HTLV-1 proteins in the spinal cords of 3 patients with HAM/TSP. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with our unique staining procedure made it possible to visualize HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs infiltrating the CNS of the HAM/TSP patients. The frequency of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs was more than 20% of CD8-positive cells infiltrating the CNS. In addition, HTLV-1 proteins were detected in CD4-positive infiltrating T lymphocytes but not CNS resident cells. Although neurons were generally preserved, apoptotic oligodendrocytes were frequently in contact with CD8-positive cells; this likely resulted in demyelination. These findings suggest that the immune responses of the CTLs against HTLV-1Yinfected CD4-positive lymphocytes migrating into the CNS resulted in bystander neural damage.",

            "text": "Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is estimated to affect 1 to 2 \u00c2 10 7 people worldwide. Although HTLV-1 infection is lifelong, the majority of infected individuals remain asymptomatic; only 1% to 2% of these individuals develop HTLV-1Yassociated diseases, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (1) , and a range of chronic inflammatory diseases, including myelopathy (2Y4), uveitis (5) , arthritis (6) , polymyositis (7, 8) , inclusion-body myositis (9, 10) , and alveolitis (11) . The most recognized inflammatory disease is HTLV-1Yassociated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), in which CNS lesions correspond to progressive weakness of the lower extremities, with spasticity, urinary incontinence, and mild sensory disturbance. Patients with HAM/TSP exhibit higher HTLV-1 proviral load in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (12) . Furthermore, HTLV-1Yinfected cells accumulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on neurologic exacerbation (13) . One of the most striking features of the cellular immune response in patients with HAM/TSP is the highly elevated numbers of HTLV-1Yspecific CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in PBMCs compared with asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (14, 15) . These CTLs produce proinflammatory cytokines (16, 17) . The HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs are thought to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP (18, 19) . This persistently activated CTL immune response to HTLV-1 provides unequivocal evidence of persistent HTLV-1 antigen expression in vivo. To date, no previous studies have shown CTLs and HTLV-1 proteins in CNS tissues from patients with HAM/TSP. Although Skinner et al visualized antigen-specific T cells with nonfrozen tissues (20) , the method has not been adapted to frozen tissue samples. In this study, we established novel in situ staining methods for detecting virus-specific CTLs and HTLV-1 proteins in frozen human tissue samples. We detected a number of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs and HTLV-1Yinfected CD4-positive cells infiltrating the CNS and verified the bystander hypothesis that the interaction between HTLV-1Y specific CTLs and HTLV-1Yinfected T lymphocytes causes damage to bystander neural cells in the CNS (21) . family members and stored them at j80-C until use. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax11-19 (LLFGYPVYV) and Tax301-309 (SFHSLHLLF) are well-characterized immunodominant epitopes that are restricted to HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*24, respectively (22, 23) . Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed in all of the autopsied samples (24) . Three samples were found suitable for use in this study. The first was from an HLA-A*02Ypositive patient (No. 8624), the second was from an HLA-A*24Ypositive patient (No. 6315), and the third was from an HLA-A*02 and HLA-A*24 doubleY positive patient (No. 6664). We had frozen block samples from entire levels of the spinal cord of each patient. We first evaluated each block by routine histology and used the samples with inflammatory lesions for the study. The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . This study was approved by the Kagoshima University Ethics Committee.",

The fluorescence pattern of the tetramer exactly colocalized with that of anti-CD8 mAb on the PBMCs ( Fig. 2A) . This is consistent with the fact that CD8 cells express a T-cell receptor. We could not detect HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs at all with Tax-tetramer or -pentamer in frozen samples using a reported procedure for nonfrozen samples (20) . We tested several modified staining procedures and finally found that prefixing the frozen sections at a very low concentration of PFA was optimal. We selected the sections that stained best with the tetramer or pentamer from several sections from each block. We detected HTLV-1 Tax11-19Yspecific CTLs in the parenchyma of the spinal cords from an HLA-A*02Ypositive patient (Fig. 2B) and an HLA-A*24Ypositive patient ( Fig. 2C ) with HLA-A*02/Tax-tetramer and HLA-A*24/Tax-tetramer, respectively. The CTLs were also detected in the thickened leptomeninges (Fig. 2D ). On the other hand, no cells were detected by HIV Gag-tetramer and influenza-tetramer as tetramer controls (Fig. 2E ).",

Tax-specific CTLs stained with Taxtetramer were frequently noted in the lesions. Double staining revealed that the fluorescence of Tax-tetramer colocalized with that of anti-CD8 mAb in all 3 patients (Fig. 3AYC) . Meanwhile, HIV-tetramer restricted by either HLA-A*02 or HLA-A*24 did not bind any CD8-positive cells in the corresponding specimen (Fig. 3D ). Next, we evaluated the frequency of Tax-specific CTLs in CD8-positive lymphocytes in 4 sections of the spinal cord from each patient. The percentages of Tax-specific CTLs in CD8positive cells were 22.1% (62 of 280) and 31.1% (96 of 309) in patients with HLA-A*02Ypositive and HLA-A*24Ypositive patients, respectively (Table 3) . Patient 6664 had no significant cellular infiltrates, and we only detected 2 HLA-A*24/Tax-tetramerYpositive and no HLA-A*02/Tax-tetramerYpositive cells in the 4 sections of the spinal cord from that patient. In addition to Tax-tetramer, Tax-pentamer was also used for the staining of the tissues from Patient 8624 to corroborate our results with Tax-tetramer. Similarly, the fluorescence of Taxpentamer exactly colocalized with that of anti-CD8 mAb; the frequency of Tax-pentamerYpositive cells in CD8-positive cells was 31% in the lesion (Fig. 3E ).",

We next detected 3 HTLV-1 proteins (Tax, Env, and Gag) in the CNS tissues of the HAM-TSP patients. Tax was found in the cells near vessels (Fig. 4A, B) and in the leptomeninges. The nuclear protein Tax showed a patchy staining pattern in the nuclei (Fig. 4C, D, G) , whereas Env and Gag were detected in the cell membrane or cytoplasm (Fig. 4EYG) . Double staining revealed that the cells expressing Tax, Env, or Gag were CD4-positive lymphocytes (Fig. 4CYF ). CD68-, CD8-, CNPase-, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)Ypositive cells were not positive for HTLV-1 Tax ( (Table 3 ). More than 50% of infiltrating CD4-positive cells were infected with HTLV-1. Furthermore, HTLV-1Yinfected cells had a greater tendency to undergo apoptosis than noninfected cells; 36.4% of the infected cells were undergoing apoptosis, whereas 10.3% of noninfected cells were undergoing apoptosis in Patient 8624 (Table 3 ).

Active caspase-3 showed granular staining patterns in our pictures, although it has shown a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern in previous studies. The staining pattern may differ because of the different conditions of the frozen samples. We tried to detect the apoptotic cells with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples by light microscopy. Caspase-3 was detected in the cell cytoplasm in those samples (Fig. 6A) . Next, we stained the sections by methods other than the antiYactive caspase-3 Ab to corroborate the frequent apoptosis in the spinal cord. Using a TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, we detected a number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 6B, C) . We also stained these spinal cord samples with antiYsingle-stranded DNA Ab and obtained similar findings (Fig. 6E) . Altogether, the 3 staining methods showed frequent apoptosis in the affected spinal cords (Fig. 6) .",

The fixation of human CNS samples with a very low concentration of PFA made it possible to visualize antigen-specific CTLs using tetramers or a pentamer in the CNS. Strikingly, their frequency reached more than 20% in CD8-positive cells that had migrated to the CNS. In a flow cytometric study in our cohort, we detected HTLV-1 Tax11-19Yspecific and HTLV-1 Tax301-309Yspecific CTLs in PBMCs from patients with HAM/TSP at 2.25% (0.0%Y18.7%) (26) and 4.34% (0.2%Y17.6%) (unpublished data), respectively. The present data are consistent with another report in which the frequency of HTLV-1 TaxYspecific CTLs was higher in CSF than in PBMCs (18) . Although the frequency of the CTLs differs by the case, it may be attributed to the difference in the phase of the disease or the duration of the illness.",

            "text": "Granzyme B and perforin, both known as cytotoxic molecules of CTLs, were detected along with IFN-F in the parenchyma near the vessels in the CNS. Some CTLs contained granzyme B. Human T-lymphotropic virus type-1Yspecific CTLs were in contact with HTLV-1Yinfected cells, and apoptotic cells were frequently noted near the CD8-positive cells. These results strongly suggest that the infiltrating CTLs function as effector cells in the CNS. Interestingly, a considerable number of oligodendrocytes underwent apoptosis in the affected lesions. Meanwhile, the oligodendrocytes neither increase the expression levels of HLA-ABC nor express HTLV-1 proteins. The HTLV-1Y positive cells were only infiltrating CD4-positive T cells. These results suggest that HTLV-1Yinfected CD4-positive T cells, but not oligodendrocytes, are the main targets of HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs in the CNS, and that an interaction between these infected CD4-positive cells and CTLs may cause bystander damage in oligodendrocytes that is associated with demyelination. Similarly, in a previous study on an animal model of neurotropic mouse coronavirus infection, activated CD8-positive T cells specific to neither the virus nor CNS antigens caused demyelination (27) . Mechanisms of demyelination in other viral infections in the CNS, even those exhibiting dense infiltration of activated CTLs such as measles or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus encephalitis, are unclear. Whereas a CD8-positive CTL has been considered to be beneficial for the host infected by a certain virus by diminishing virus-infected cells, recent studies clearly show that strong CTL responses to a pathogen sometimes induce an immunopathology that is harmful to the host. For example, in a mouse model of CNS lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, the depletion of CD8-positive T cells rescues the animal from a fatal condition (28) . In another report, highly activated CD8-positive T cells in the brain were correlated with early CNS dysfunction in simian immunodeficiency virus infection (29) . Similarly, markedly increased HTLV-1Yspecific CTLs in the CNS may induce the development of HAM/TSP.",
