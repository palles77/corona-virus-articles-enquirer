[7] Bone marrow was collected for plasma cell count, immunophenotypic analysis, cytogenetic analysis, and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (interphase FISH) analysis, and the HBV virology test results at baseline were also collected in MM patients. Immunophenotypic analyses were performed in 269 patients using a four-color direct immunofluorescence staining to identify the immunophenotype of clonal plasma cell from erythrocyte-lysed bone marrow samples. The fluorescence was FITC/PE/PerCP-Cy5.5/APC, whereas the panel was CD38/CD56/CD9/CD45, CD45/CXCR4/CD117/ CD38, CD38/CD138/CD45/CD19, CD38/CD45/cKappa/ cLamda, CD38/CD45/CD20/CD28, and CD38/CD45/CD33/ CD200. High risk cytogenetic abnormality was defined as at least abnormalities or 17p-by routine cytogenetic analysis. FISH was performed in interphase nuclei, which included 1q21 amplification, D13s319 (13q14.3) deletion, RB1 (13q14) deletion, P53 (17p13) deletion, and IgH (14q32) rearrangement. A minimum of 200 interphase cells were analyzed for each probe. All patients were screened for the presence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), surface antibody, e antigen (HBeAg), e antibody (HBeAb), core antibody (HBcAb), and HBV DNA load.",

In Engels's report, [8] 53,045 (8.8%) were tested HBsAg + among 603,585 people at health screening. HBsAg + subjects had elevated risk of NHL, but not MM. The incidence of MM is 2.04/100,000 per year in HBsAg + population whereas 2.58/100,000 per year in HBsAg\u2212 population. In another study from Guangdong Province in China, [9] the HBsAg + rate was significantly higher in MM patients (19.4%) than acute leukemia patients (12.0%), which were higher than the average incidence of hepatitis B (7.2%) announced by Chinese Center for Disease Control (China CDC). [10] The controversy may come from the regional differences. In a nested case-control study in Europe (study EPIC), [11] HBV carrier among controls in different countries ranged from 0% to 2.7%. Statistically significant association was found between HBsAg seropositivity and the risk of MM (odds ratio = 4.00; 95% confidence interval: 1.00-16.00) after a 3-year follow-up. Due to the lower prevalence of hepatitis B in Europe, there were only 6 HBsAg + MM patients in the treatment group and 3 in the control group in this study, which may lead to misjudgment due to the small sample size.",

Bortezomib could impair several immune properties of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), suppresses essential immune functions of human CD4 + T-cells activated by allogeneic DCs.
