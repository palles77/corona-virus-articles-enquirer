As they refine a diagnosis, doctors look for tests that would \"rule in\" (confirm) or \"rule out\" (disqualify) the diagnosis. For example, chest pain, shortness of breath, and pain in the left arm may indicate heart attack; a positive thallium stress test, however, rules out heart attack as a cause of the symptoms.

Two design approaches embrace this style of dynamic categorizations: metapatterns and associative databases. In Metapattern, Context and Time in Information Models, Pieter Wisse 19 argues that the current approach of classifying items by what class they belong to (e.g., in an Object Oriented system) is far too restrictive and suggests an approach whereby instances can morph their behavior by shifting \"contexts.\" Each \"context\" is like a class, except it is dynamic and additive.

In this case, because the transition between open and closed is not instantaneous, and because the interesting differences are what happens when a car or a child breaks the electric eye beam near the flow, we model \"opening\" and \"closing\" as states.
