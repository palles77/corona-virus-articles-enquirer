            "text": "In the Republic of Korea, patients are free to choose their medical provider from among clinics, hospitals, and tertiary hospitals. The functional differences between these facilities are unclear; therefore, there is an increased need to strengthen primary care centered on clinics. 1,2 Starfield 3 evaluated the elements composing the primary health care system of a country and reported that the lower the level of primary health care, the more it affected health outcomes, health care expenditures, and patient satisfaction. A study that applied the same criteria in Korea revealed a low level of primary care; 4 during the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015, patients' ability to report directly to a tertiary hospital without undergoing a proper referral process was identified as the main cause of MERS contamination. 5 One study found that up to 85% of patients chose tertiary hospitals over primary care institutions such as clinics, mostly based on the preferences of patients with chronic diseases such as hypertension. 6 In 2009, the Ministry of Health and Welfare increased outpatient outof-pocket payments for tertiary hospitals to promote the utilization of clinics, but the effect was found to be partial. 7 Although the choice of providers is unrestricted in Korea, there are few studies from the consumer's perspective, except for a few studies showing that quality and satisfaction affect patient revisitation. 8, 9 In Korea's referral system, the factors that affect the use of each type of medical institution are not well identified. Even in other countries, patients' choice of providers is an interesting topic. A largescale study was conducted in the UK to improve the long wait times. 10 In addition, the motives in choosing a provider are important with regard to efficiency. 11 Although studies on patient motives in choosing a provider are mostly related to their choice of primary care clinic or general practitioner, 12, 13 they also include topics such as obstetrics-gynecology, 14, 15 surgery, 16, 17 and public-private institutions. 18 Patient choice in health care utilization is an important emerging topic in health management, including aspects such as self-care and consumer rights (informed choice). 19, 20 Although provider policy is important in improving the health care delivery system, considering the consumer's perspective is also necessary. 21 The present study investigated the patients' choice of providers and the consequent type of medical institution; these results will form the basis for improving the health care delivery system and strengthening primary health care.",

The survey period was from August 28, 2015, to September 4, 2015. The variables included gender, age, region, educational level, income, type of insurance, chronic diseases, patient motives in choosing a provider, and type of medical institution used to obtain health care for chronic diseases.

Each factor's degree of importance was measured using a 4-point scale. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the survey results to evaluate the validity of each question. Principal axis factoring was used as an estimation method; the number of factors was determined using Kaiser's criteria (eigenvalue .1). The squared multiple correlations of each variable with all other variables were used as the prior communality estimates. If the number of factors satisfying Kaiser's criteria was insufficient, it was determined using a cumulative variation. Items with $0.4 factor loading were included as the final factors. Varimax and Cronbach's alpha were used as the rotation method and to measure the reliability of the exploratory factor analysis, respectively.",

The significance of this study lies in its use of a survey to identify functional differences between institutions, which have not previously been sufficiently understood in analyzing the current situation in Korea. This study has some limitations because of its cross-sectional design: information to determine causality was lacking and the determination of the type of medical institution was based on a survey rather actual data. It is also possible that the short survey period may have affected the results. This study was also limited in evaluating how the motives in choosing a provider and the type of medical institution affected the clinical outcome, which indicates the need for further research.",
