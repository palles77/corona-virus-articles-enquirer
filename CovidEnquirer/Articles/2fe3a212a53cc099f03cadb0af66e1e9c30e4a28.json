Human cases of POWV have been reported in the United States, Canada, and Russia (reviewed in Ebel, 2010; Hermance and Thangamani, 2017) . Though POWV infections are relatively rare, they can cause severe or even fatal neuroinvasive disease, including encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis. Approximately 10% of neuroinvasive POWV cases are fatal, and 50% of survivors suffer long-term neurological sequelae (Ebel, 2010; Hermance and Thangamani, 2017) . Unfortunately, POWV is emerging; increasing numbers of cases have been diagnosed in the United States over the past decade (Hermance and Thangamani, 2017; Krow-Lucal et al., 2018) , and up to 5% of Ixodes scapularis ticks isolated in parts of New York, Connecticut, and Wisconsin now test positive for POWV (Aliota et al., 2014; Anderson and Armstrong, 2012; Knox et al., 2017) .",

POWV lineage I strains are predominantly maintained in Ixodes cookei ticks and include isolates from New York and Canada, whereas lineage II strains are found in Ixodes scapularis deer ticks and include strains from regions infested by these ticks (Ebel et al., 2001) . Because deer ticks are more aggressive at biting humans, lineage II viruses may have greater epidemic potential. Although POWV has been found predominantly in north-central and northeastern parts of the United States in Ixodes species ticks, POWV also has been isolated from Dermacentor andersoni ticks in Colorado (Thomas et al., 1960) , indicating the vector and geographical range may be larger than previously estimated.",

Within their E proteins, the mammalian TBFV group shares R70% amino acid identity but only about 54%-60% identity with seabird TBFVs. One exception is Gadgets Gully virus (GGYV), which is more closely related to the mammalian TBFVs even though it causes infection of seabirds (Grard et al., 2007) . Vaccines have been developed against several mammalian TBFVs, although only TBEV vaccines have proven efficacy (Ishikawa et al., 2014) . TBEV vaccines induce antibodies capable of neutralizing closely related TBFVs, including OHFV, KFDV, and AHFV (McAuley et al., 2017) . However, TBEV immune sera had limited cross-neutralizing activity against the more distantly related POWV. No approved vaccines for POWV exist.",

We selected a vaccine platform that we developed for a distantly related flavivirus, Zika virus (ZIKV): a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated modified mRNA encoding the structural premembrane (prM) and E protein genes . Co-expression of the flavivirus structural proteins prM and E results in the secretion of subviral particles (SVPs) that share many functional and antigenic features with infectious virions and elicit neutralizing antibodies. SVPs are heterogeneous in size and likely display E proteins in distinct chemical environments, with the potential to affect epitope display Heinz et al., 1995; Kiermayr et al., 2009; Konishi and Fujii, 2002; Konishi et al., 1992) . In addition to selecting the POWV prM-E structural gene components, we used an mRNA platform, because some modified mRNA have been reported to enhance follicular helper T cell and germinal center B cell responses that are essential for inducing memory B cells and durable levels of neutralizing antibody (Pardi et al., 2018) .",

Although others have described murine models of POWV infection, these have been in juvenile mice (4-5 weeks old), which are not ideal for experiments requiring iterative immunization and resting periods (Hermance and Thangamani, 2015; Holbrook et al., 2005; Mlera et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013) . Accordingly, we tested the ability of two POWV strains, LB (a lineage I strain) and Spooner (a lineage II DTV strain) to cause morbidity and mortality in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice at 7 or 14 weeks of age. Following subcutaneous inoculation of 10 2 focus-forming units (FFU) of POWV LB, lethal infection ensued in 93% of 7and 14-week-old mice, with a mean time to death of 8.6 and 9.5 days post-infection (dpi), respectively ( Figure 1A ). All mice inoculated with POWV LB lost approximately 15%-25% of their body weight ( Figure 1B ). POWV LB-infected mice exhibited ruffled fur, hunched posture, lethargy, and partial paralysis, although $50% of mice did not exhibit these signs before death ( Figure 1C ). In comparison, POWV Spooner resulted in lower mortality rates; 57% and 60% of 7-and 14-week-old mice succumbed to infection with mean times to death of 13.0 and 12.7 days, respectively ( Figure 1D ). Because of the partial lethality caused by POWV Spooner in WT mice, we created a more susceptible host by transiently blocking type I interferon (IFN) signaling with an anti-IFN receptor (Ifnar1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), MAR1-5A3 (Sheehan et al., 2006) . When 0.5 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb was administered one day before infection, POWV Spooner resulted in 100% lethality, with a mean time to death of 9.7 days ( Figure 1D ). Whereas POWV Spooner-infected WT mice typically displayed $15%-20% body weight loss, infected mice treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAb sustained greater weight loss of $30% ( Figure 1E ). Most POWV Spooner-infected WT mice (70%-85%) displayed ruffled fur, hunched posture, and lethargy, with a minority developing limb paralysis ( Figure 1F ). In comparison, anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated, POWV Spooner-infected mice uniformly displayed signs of morbidity before death.",

We designed a base-modified mRNA encoding the prM and E genes of POWV Spooner that was preceded by the prM signal sequence of POWV (POWV sig ) or (A-F) C57BL/6 mice receiving two doses of POWV sig or JEV sig vaccines or a placebo were challenged 4 weeks after the second dose with 10 2 FFU of (A-C) POWV lineage II strain Spooner (following anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment) (n = 10 per group) or (D-F) POWV lineage I strain LB (n = 10 for JEV sig and placebo; n = 9 for POWV sig ). (G-I) Serum samples were collected from mice that received two doses of POWV sig or a placebo and passively transferred to naive C57BL/6 mice one day before challenge with 10 2 FFU POWV LB (n = 9 per group). Mice received a dose of 3 or 10 mL of vaccine immune serum or 10 mL of placebo serum. Mice were monitored for mortality (A, D, and G) for 21 days following viral challenge. Statistical significance was determined by the log rank test with a Bonferroni correction (***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001). Mean weight change (B, E, and H) post-viral challenge is shown. Error bars represent SEM. Statistical significance was signal sequence of JEV (JEV sig ); the latter heterologous JEV signal sequence was tested because for some flaviviruses, it results in enhanced secretion of SVPs (Davis et al., 2001; Dowd et al., 2016) . Six-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 10 mg of POWV sig , JEV sig , or placebo LNPs by intramuscular inoculation, followed by a second 10 mg booster dose 28 days later ( Figure 2A ). Serum was collected preboost on day 27 and postboost on day 42, and neutralizing activity was assessed by reporter virus particle (RVP) assay using the C-prM-E proteins of the POWV lineage II strain P0375 and Raji-SIGNR cells . RVP technology has been used extensively in the preclinical and clinical evaluation of flavivirus vaccine candidates Emanuel et al., 2018; Gaudinski et al., 2018; Pardi et al., 2017; Richner et al., 2017a) . Following the first dose, the reciprocal mean titers that reduced RVP infection by 50% (50% maximal effective inhibitory concentration [EC 50 ]) values were 13,683 \u00b1 2,671 (n = 20) and 9,476 \u00b1 1,271 (n = 20) for POWV sig and JEV sig , respectively, and were not statistically different between the two formulations (p > 0.9). Neutralization titers were boosted approximately 15-fold following the second dose for both formulations, with EC 50 values of 200,402 \u00b1 20,414 (n = 20) for POWV sig and 225,380 \u00b1 21,112 (n = 20) for JEV sig . Despite the high EC 50 values after the first dose, a neutralization-resistant fraction was observed for both formulations.",

Consistent with these data, high levels of viremia were measured in placebo-vaccinated mice, but not in POWV sig -and JEV sig -vaccinated mice (Figure 3C) . Similar results were observed following POWV LB challenge in the absence of anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment. Whereas 80% of placebo-vaccinated mice succumbed following LB infection, 100% of POWV sig -and JEV sig -vaccinated mice survived infection ( Figure 3D ).

Passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice resulted in significant reductions in viremia at 2 dpi: mice receiving 3 mL of POWV sig serum had more than a 500-fold reduction (p < 0.05) in viremia following challenge compared to mice receiving serum from placebo-treated mice, and viremia was undetectable in mice that received 10 mL of POWV sig serum.

For this study, we immunized 10-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice with 10 mg of POWV sig or placebo vaccines. Twenty-eight days later, mice were treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAb and then challenged via subcutaneous inoculation with 10 2 FFU of POWV Spooner. As observed previously, 100% of placebo-immunized mice succumbed to infection and lost body weight ( Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, POWV sig -immunized mice uniformly survived challenge and maintained body weight. Furthermore, no viremia was detected in POWV sig -immunized mice at 2 dpi, compared to high levels in placebo-immunized mice ( Figure 4C ). Serum samples were collected on days 2 and 21 post-challenge for evaluation of neutralization titers. EC 50 values were not significantly different between the two time points (p > 0.07) ( Figure 4D ), with most mice having less than a two-fold change in titer (Table 1) , indicating that little or no boost in antibody response occurred following viral challenge in POWV sig -immunized mice. These data suggest that one dose of mRNA vaccine was sufficient to induce protective, if not sterilizing, immunity against POWV challenge.",

To determine the ability of serum from POWV-vaccinated mice to inhibit other TBFVs, we tested sera from POWV sig -or JEV sig -vaccinated (two-dose) mice for their capacity to inhibit TBEV, LGTV, and GGYV RVPs (Figures 5B-5D; Figure S2 ). TBEV was chosen because it overlaps geographically with POWV in parts of far eastern Russia (Leonova et al., 2009 (Leonova et al., , 2017 and has a large public health impact, infecting more than 10,000 people annually in Europe and Asia (Gritsun et al., 2003) . LGTV was selected due to its relatedness to TBEV and prior use as a TBEV vaccine (Mandl et al., 1991) . GGYV is one of the most divergent viruses of the mammalian (Grard et al., 2007) and thus can demonstrate the breadth of cross-reactive response of the POWV vaccine sera. POWV shares about 77% amino acid identity in E protein sequence with LGTV and TBEV and 72% with GGYV. Most vaccine sera neutralized infection by RVPs bearing the E proteins of the other TBFVs, although some samples neutralized GGYV, whereas others did not ( Figures 5B-5D ). The variable neutralization of GGYV by POWV vaccine sera warrants further study but may be due to the greater sequence dissimilarity between the viruses ( Figure 5A ) and the resultant differential display of neutralizing epitopes. Sera from POWV sig -vaccinated mice exhibited cross-neutralizing activity with mean EC 50 values against TBEV, LGTV, and GGYV of 104 \u00b1 21 (n = 15), 215 \u00b1 112 (n = 13), and 113 \u00b1 57 (n = 15), respectively. JEV sig induced similar crossneutralizing titers against TBEV (82 \u00b1 75, n = 15), LGTV (119 \u00b1 92, n = 23), and GGYV (107 \u00b1 60, n = 15).",

We tested the efficacy of the POWV sig vaccine against LGTV, but not TBEV or GGYV due to the requirement of an A-BSL4 facility or lack of an existing challenge model, respectively. Following the two-dose vaccination schedule (Figure 2A ), mice were challenged via subcutaneous inoculation with 10 2 FFU of LGTV at 28 days post-boost. Because LGTV is pathogenic in Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, but not WT mice (Weber et al., 2014) , we treated animals with 0.5 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb one day before virus challenge. Following LGTV challenge, 60% of placebo-treated mice lost 15% to 35% body weight, whereas only 7% of POWV sig -vacci- nated mice lost more than 10% body weight and 87% of vaccinated mice maintained their weight ( Figure 6A ). POWV sigvaccinated mice were fully protected from clinical disease, whereas $50% of placebo-treated mice exhibited signs of paralysis, with one mouse succumbing to LGTV challenge ( Figure 6B ). POWV sig -vaccinated mice had significantly less viremia than placebo-treated mice at 2 dpi, with $6,000-fold reduction in viral titer (p < 0.0001) (Figure 6C ). POWV sig -vaccinated mice also had substantially less viral RNA in the spleen, brain, and spinal cord at 15 days post-LGTV challenge (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons) ( Figure 5D ). Thus, the POWV sig vaccine induces an immune response that can protect against heterologous challenge with LGTV.",

An advantage of the LNP-encapsulated modified mRNA platform is that it allows rapid development of vaccine candidates by insertion of the desired viral mRNA sequence into the coding region. In this study, we used the mRNA vaccine platform previously shown to be effective in mice against ZIKV (Pardi et al., 2018; Richner et al., 2017a) to develop a countermeasure against POWV, another emerging flavivirus (Hermance and Thangamani, 2017) . Vaccination of mice with LNP-encapsulated mRNA-encoding POWV structural genes induced potently neutralizing antibody responses and protection against challenge by POWV strains from both lineages. Furthermore, one dose of the POWV mRNA vaccine was sufficient to induce robust immunity, because no viremia or significant anamnestic antibody response was observed following POWV challenge.",

This apparent disparity in results may have several reasons. The antibody repertoire produced in mice versus humans in response to TBFVs may be more cross-reactive, because mouse and human antibody specificities to TBEV immunization can be different (Jarmer et al., 2014) . Notwithstanding these data, mouse immune ascites fluid raised against some TBFVs (TBEV, OHFV, and KFDV) was not neutralizing against POWV (McAuley et al., 2017) . Furthermore, a separate study evaluating a TBEV vaccine in mice observed little crossneutralization of POWV (a 1:8 antibody titer) and no cross-protection against POWV challenge in vivo (Chernokhaeva et al., 2016) . It remains possible that there is a directionality to the cross-reactive response, such that POWV induces more cross-reactive antibodies than TBEV or other TBFVs due to differential display of conserved epitopes. Alternatively, the SVPs induced by the mRNA vaccine may display more cross-reactive epitopes than inactivated or fully infectious TBEV virions due to differences in the arrangement of E proteins on SVPs compared to virions (Kiermayr et al., 2009; Kuhn et al., 2015) . Studies comparing the antibody repertoires induced by LNP-mRNA vaccines to those generated after live virus infections or inactivated virus vaccination could address these questions. In addition, the RVP-based assay we used to assess neutralization titers against TBEV may be more sensitive than the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) used by others. We observed increased sensitivity of the RVP-based neutralization assay compared to FRNT for POWV; however, the reciprocal result was true for LGTV in our study.",

Although a previous study showed the anti-ZIKV antibody responses to an LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine endure for at least five months post-vaccination (Pardi et al., 2018) , the durability and breadth of the POWV LNP-mRNA antibody response warrants further study. This may apply particularly to the cross-reactive antibody response, because anti-flavivirus antibody responses generated by long-lived plasma cells in the memory B cell compartment in the context of West Nile virus (WNV) infection had a more type-specific repertoire (Purtha et al., 2011) . Moreover, previous studies with ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) found the cross-neutralizing antibody response to flavivirus infections is greatest during the early-convalescent stage (<6 months) and then wanes over time (Collins et al., 2017; Montoya et al., 2018) .

Passive transfer of serum from POWV LNP-mRNAvaccinated mice was sufficient for protection against lethal POWV challenge. However, an LNP-mRNA ZIKV vaccine described by Pardi and colleagues induced strong, antigenspecific T cell responses, in addition to neutralizing antibodies (Pardi et al., 2018) . Although we did not characterize the T cell response to the POWV mRNA-LNP vaccine, because insight into the immunodominance hierarchy and tetramer-specific reagents are lacking, if a similar such T cell response is generated, it could contribute to protection against POWV or LGTV challenge.",

The final mRNA utilized a cap 1 structure modification to increase mRNA translation efficiency. Encoded signal sequences were from POWV prM (SGVDWTWTFLVMALMT) or JEV prM (MWLVSLAIVTACAGA) and the prM and E genes were derived from POWV Spooner. LNP formulations were prepared by ethanol drop nanoprecipitation on a microfluidic mixer (Precision Nanosystems). Briefly, lipids were dissolved in ethanol at molar ratios of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (ionizable lipid: structural lipid: sterol: PEG-lipid) and mixed with mRNA in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.0, at a ratio of 3:1 (aqueous:ethanol). Formulations were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing sucrose (8%) in dialysis cassettes for at least 18 h. Formulations were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (EMD Millipore) and sterile filtered through 0.22-mm filters. All formulations were tested for particle size, RNA encapsulation, and endotoxin and were between 80 to 100 nm in size, with greater than 90% encapsulation and < 10 EU/ml of endotoxin.",

Viral infections with POWV or LGTV were performed via subcutaneous inoculation in the footpad with 10 2 FFU of virus. For LGTV and POWV Spooner challenge, 0.5 mg of anti-Ifnar1 blocking mAb MAR1-5A3 (Sheehan et al., 2006) was administered one day prior to infection via intraperitoneal injection. Animals were monitored for mortality, weight loss, and clinical score. To evaluate clinical disease following POWV infection, mice were assigned to one of the following categories each day: (A) no disease, (B) ruffled fur, (C) ruffled fur with hunched posture, (D) lethargy or decreased scurrying activity, (E) sick with slow to no movement, or (F) moribund or dead; moribund mice were euthanized. To evaluate clinical disease following LGTV challenge, cages were blinded and mice were assigned to one of the following categories each day: (A) no disease, (B) partial hindlimb paralysis, (C) complete paralysis of one hindlimb, (D) complete paralysis of both hindlimbs, or (E) moribund or dead; days post-infection, mice were sacrificed and organs were collected following extensive perfusion with PBS. Organs were weighed and homogenized using a MagNA Lyser (Roche). Viral RNA from homogenized organs or serum was isolated using the MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher) and measured by TaqMan one-step quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) on an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument.

(B) The reciprocal neutralization titers (EC 50 values) are shown. Bars represent median values. Statistical significance was determined using an ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test (ns, not significant; *p < 0.05; ****p < 0.0001).
