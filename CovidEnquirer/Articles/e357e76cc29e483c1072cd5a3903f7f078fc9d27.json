            "text": "A major limiting factor retarding the clinical success of dendritic cell (DC)-based genetic immunizations (DNA vaccination) is the scarcity of biologically safe and effective carrier systems for targeting the antigen-encoded DNA vaccines to DCs under in vivo settings. Herein, we report on a potent, mannose receptor selective in vivo DC-targeting liposomes of a novel cationic amphiphile with mannose-mimicking shikimoyl head-group. Flow cytometric experiments with cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of mice s.c. immunized with lipoplexes of pGFP plasmid (model DNA vaccine) using anti-CD11c antibody-labeled magnetic beads revealed in vivo DC-targeting properties of the presently described liposomal DNA vaccine carrier. Importantly, s.c. immunizations of mice with electrostatic complex of the in vivo DC-targeting liposome and melanoma antigen-encoded DNA vaccine (p-CMV-MART1) induced long-lasting antimelanoma immune response (100 days post melanoma tumor challenge) with remarkable memory response (more than 6 months after the second tumor challenge). The presently described direct in vivo DC-targeting liposomal DNA vaccine carrier is expected to find future exploitations toward designing effective vaccines for various infectious diseases and cancers.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), body's most professional antigen-presenting cells, possess the unique ability of capturing and processing pathogenic antigens in the peripheral blood and tissues. The antigen-loaded DCs migrate through afferent lymphatics to the nearby draining lymph nodes where they present the processed antigen fragments in complexation with both classical major histocompatibility complexes (MHC class I and II) and nonclassical (CD1 family) antigen-presenting molecules to the resting T lymphocytes. [1] [2] [3] Because of such distinguishing antigen-presenting ability of the DCs, DCs pulsed/transduced with tumor-associated or viral antigens are finding increasing applications as vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases. DCs are often ex vivo transfected with tumor/viral antigens-encoded DNA vaccines. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Such ex vivo DC transfection-based genetic immunization protocols, although highly efficient in combating cancer, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Autologous DC precursors are painstakingly isolated, the isolated autologous DC precursors are then ex vivo transfected with DNA vaccines, and the ex vivo transfected DCs finally need to be reimplanted in recipient's body for mounting immune response. To this end, both viral and nonviral vectors are now being used for direct in vivo targeting of DNA vaccines to DCs. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] However, achieving long-lasting immunity through use of simple and cost-effective in vivo DC-targeting system remains a formidable challenge.",

We envisaged that the DC transfection efficiency of this new class of mannose receptor selective lipids containing mannose-mimicking shikimoyl-and quinoyl-head-groups need to be further enhanced for making their liposomes effective in targeting DNA vaccines to DCs under in vivo settings. With such rationale in mind, in the present study, we chemically transformed the lysine side chain amino group into the transfection enhancing guanidine group. Herein, we show that liposomes of the cationic amphiphile containing a mannose-mimicking shikimoyl head-group and two n-hexadecyl hydrophobic tails can target DNA vaccines to DCs under in vivo settings when the side chain amino group of the lysine spacer is guanidinylated (lipid 1, Figure 1 ). We show that direct in vivo immunization (s.c.) of mice with electrostatic complex of the liposome of lipid 1 and melanoma antigen-encoded DNA vaccine (p-CMV-MART1) induces long-lasting antimelanoma immune response (100 days post melanoma tumor challenge) with remarkable memory response (more than 6 months after the second tumor challenge). With the availability of the presently described cationic lipid 1, overcoming the formidable challenge of inducing longlasting immune response through direct in vivo targeting of tumor antigen-encoded DNA vaccines to DCs will now become feasible. The presently described direct in vivo DC-targeting liposomal DNA vaccine carriers are thus expected to find future applications in effective vaccine developments for various infectious diseases and cancers.",

First, we evaluated DC transfection properties of the liposomes of lipids 1-3 by flow cytometry using a GFP plasmid (as a model DNA vaccine). First we transfected mbmDCs with GFP plasmid complexed with liposomes of lipids 1-3 and equimolar 1,2-dioleyol-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE; as co-lipid) at cationic lipid:DNA charge ratio of 4:1 (initial transfection experiments across a range of lipid:DNA charge ratios revealed 4:1 to be the most optimal lipid:DNA charge ratio, data not shown). Transfected cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 2a ) and the relative transfection efficiencies of lipids 1-3 were measured by flow cytometry (Figure 2c ). In such flow cytometric measurements of transfection efficiency, the autofluorescence intensities of the untreated control cells are subtracted from the fluorescence intensities of the treated cells. The lipoplexes of lipid 1 with mannose-mimicking shikimoyl head-group was found to be the most efficient with ~20% DC transfection efficiency, followed by liposomes of lipids 2 and 3 with ~12% and ~5% DC transfection efficiencies, respectively (Figure 2c) . Commercially available LipofectAmine 2000 was found to be very poor in transfecting mbmDCs (Figure 2a,c) . Mannose receptor selective DC transfection properties of lipids 1-3 were significantly affected when mbmDCs were preincubated with 1 mg/ml mannan, a natural ligand for mannose receptor (Figure 2b,d) , which supports the notion that the DC transfection by lipids 1-3 are mediated via mannose receptor. Furthermore, toward addressing concentration-dependent inhibition by mannan, we evaluated the DC transfection efficiencies of lipids 1-3 using DCs preincubated with increasing mannan concentrations across the 0.25-1.0 mg/ml. The DC transfection efficiencies were adversely affected with increasing concentrations of mannan (Supplementary Figure S13a) . Importantly, the DC transfection properties of lipids 1-3 were not significantly affected when DCs were preincubated with laminarin, a commercially available polysaccharide of glucose (Supplementary Figure S13b) . Thus, the findings summarized in Figure 2 and the Supplementary Figure S13a ,b convincingly demonstrated mannose receptor-mediated DC transfection efficacies of cationic amphiphiles with mannose-mimicking shikimoyl and quinoyl-head-groups.",

The lipoplexes (liposome:DNA complexes) of lipids 1-3 were injected s.c. into C57BL/6J mice. Twenty-four hours after injection, the percentages of GFP-positive cells in the CD11c + cells were isolated from the lymph nodes by using anti-CD11c antibody-labeled magnetic beads as described previously. 18 Mice injected with only vehicles (5% glucose solution) were used as control. The findings in the flow cytometric study revealed a significantly higher number of GFP-positive cells (~15%) in the draining lymph nodes (CD11c + cells) of mice injected with lipoplexes of lipid 1 when compared to the corresponding numbers observed in mice injected with lipoplexes of lipids 2 (~6%) and 3 (~3%) (Figure 3a,b) .

            "text": "DNA vaccination, i.e., use of naked plasmid DNA as a vaccine to prime the immune system, offers a number of practical benefits which are not easily achievable with other existing forms of vaccines such as attenuated viruses, subunit or recombinant protein vaccines, whole tumor cells, etc. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] There are a number of distinct advantages in using pDNAs in genetic immunization. They are easy to design and construct and their largescale production is cost-effective. In contrast to attenuated viral vaccines whose storage and global delivery are complicated by the need of keeping the vaccines cold, plasmid DNAs are fairly stable at room temperature. 25 Since the antigens encoded in the DNA vaccines are expressed in situ, their posttranslational modifications happen in similar way as in the case of infection with cognate pathogens. Another distinguishing feature of DNA vaccines is that the immune response induced by such genetic immunization are often primarily cellular in nature which is believed to play crucial roles for effective vaccination against pathogens (e.g., viruses) and cancers. 26, 27 Despite all these distinguishing advantages, the low in vivo cell transfection efficiencies of naked plasmid DNA, difficulty in preferentially targeting of DNA vaccines to professional antigen-presenting cells (DCs), and the modest intrinsic adjuvant activity of DNA vaccines are impeding their clinical success. To this end, immunization with autologous DCs ex vivo transfected with antigen-encoded DNA vaccines have shown promise in the past. 1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 28, 29 Such ex vivo DC transfection-based immunization protocols are labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and not patient-friendly. Aimed at resolving the above-mentioned problems associated with ex vivo DC transfection-based protocols for genetic immunization, global efforts have begun toward developing protocols for direct in vivo targeting of antigen-encoded DNA vaccines to DCs. Promising recently developed strategies for direct in vivo targeting of DNA vaccines to DCs include use of antibody to target DC-specific receptors including DEC-205, DNGR-1, CD11c, etc. for delivering encoded antigens or use of DC-specific promoter (e.g., CD11c) for expressing cytokines required for enhancing vaccine efficacies. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Daftarian et al. showed the use of fifth-generation polyamidoamine (G5-PAMAM) dendrimers possessing a DNA-loading surface and covalently grafted MHC class II-targeting peptides as a Universal DNA platform. 12 In vivo DC-targeting of a genetic vaccine encoding both cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven vaccine Aghsp70 and DC-specific CD11c-driven active transcription factor XBP1 has been shown to induce both prophylactive and therapeutic antitumor immunity. 13 Raghuwanshi et al. recently succeeded in developing an in vivo DC-targeted chitosan nanoparticles for nasal DNA immunization against nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as antigen. 14 Cao et al. constructed in vivo DC-targeting DNA vaccine by fusing tumor-associated antigen HER2/neu ectodomain to single chain antibody fragment (scFv) from NLDC-145 antibody specific for DC-restricted surface molecule DEC-205 and demonstrated its potent antitumor cellular and humoral immune response inducing efficacies. 15 Raviv et al. demonstrated that mannosylated polyion complexes are safe and effective systems for in vivo targeting of genes to CD11c + DCs. 16 It is important to emphasize that our previously reported liposomes of cationic lipids containing the mannose-mimicking shikimoyl-and quinoyl-head-groups with pure lysine spacer (i.e., without the lysine side chain amine group being guanidinylated as is the case for the presently described lipids 1-3, Figure 1 ) were capable of mounting long-lasting immune response only under ex vivo DC transfection-based DNA vaccination. 9 DCs are hard-totransfect. Although the DC transfection efficacies of these previously reported lipids containing pure lysine spacer between the mannose-mimicking head-group and hydrophobic tails 9 were ~12%, the lipids failed in mounting long-lasting immune response against melanoma challenge when used on the direct in vivo immunization mode (Supplementary Figure S17) . Since prior studies demonstrated efficient gene transfer properties of guanidinylated cationic amphiphiles, 36, 37 we decided to convert the amine group in the lysine side chain of our previously reported lipids 9 with guanidine group using conventional guanidinylation reagent HgCl 2 /N,N-di-Boc-thiourea. A number of distinguishing chemical characteristics contribute to the enhanced gene transfer efficiencies of guanidinylated cationic amphiphiles. The guanidinium groups, because of their high pKa values (~12-13), remain protonated across a much wider range of pH compared to other basic groups and thereby exhibit strong electrostatic binding properties with the phosphates group of the macromolecular DNA molecules under the physiological pH. In addition, they form characteristic parallel zwitterionic N-H + \u2026O \u2212 hydrogen bonds with the phosphate ions of the DNA molecules and form hydrogen bonds with nucleic acid bases. 37 In vitro and in vivo DC transfection studies clearly demonstrated that lipid 1 was most efficient compared to lipids 2 and 3. Hydrodynamic diameters of the liposomes of lipids 1-3 were found to be within the range 134-154 nm (Supplementary Figure S10 ) and the corresponding ranges for the lipoplexes of lipids 1-3 were within 278-292 nm (Supplementary Figure S11) . Such similar hydrodynamic diameters of the lipoplexes of lipids 1-3 are consistent with the supposition that the sizes of lipoplexes are unlikely to play major role in modulating the DC transfection efficiencies of lipids 1-3. We do not understand why increase in ex vivo DC transfection efficiency from ~12% (as was the case for our previous reported lipid 9 ) to just ~20% (through conversion of the lysine amino side chain to guanidine in the present study) imparts in vivo DC-targeting ability to the lipid. Perhaps the minimum (threshold) ex vivo DC transfection efficiency for imparting in vivo DC-targeting ability to cationic lipid lies near 20%. However, deciphering such threshold ex vivo DC transfection of cationic lipids, if any, would be impossible to find out without in-depth future structure-activity studies using more number of structural analogs such as use of multiple shikimoyl-and quinoyl-head-groups, use of multiple guanidine groups in the head-group regions, etc. An important issue is worth mentioning at this point of discussion. Although in the present study we have demonstrated the in vivo DC-targeting ability of the mannose receptor-specific lipoplex of lipid 1, the present findings do not preclude the possibility of macrophage and possibly other myeloid cells (many of which express mannose receptors on their cell surface) being transfected by the lipoplexes of lipid 1. Since DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells in mounting adaptive immune response, herein our primary focus is on the in vivo DC-transfecting ability of the presently described lipids. We have no clue yet as to the origin of more DC-targeting efficacy of lipoplex of lipid 1 compared to the lipoplexes of lipids 2 and 3. The issue remains elusive at this stage of investigation. Clearly further mechanistic studies such as binding studies using purified mannose receptor need to be undertaken in future toward gaining insights into the relative in vivo DC-targeting efficacies of the lipoplexes of lipids 1-3.",

            "text": "Despite significant recent progresses in the emerging field of in vivo DC-targeted genetic immunization, the challenge of designing a simple, safe, and effective system for in vivo targeting of DNA vaccines to DCs remains formidable. To this end, using a syngeneic mouse melanoma model, we have shown that immunization with tumor antigen (MART1)-encoded DNA vaccines in complexation with the presently described next-generation liposomal DNA vaccine carrier is capable of mounting long-lasting immune response against lethal dose of melanoma tumor challenge (all five immunized mice lived completely tumor-free lives during 100 days post first tumor challenge). p-CMV-MART1 DNA vaccine encodes 18 kDa Human MelanA/ MART1 antigen which shares 68.6% amino acid sequence identity with its murine counterpart. 19 MelanA/MART1 is a human melanocyte lineage-specific antigen expressed by majority of human malignant melanoma. Effective antigen-specific immunity ensues when DCs present the processed antigen fragments of the MART1 to both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. DCs present processed antigen fragments to CD4 + cells in complexation with MHC II molecules which causes differentiation of CD4 + T cells into T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cells (inducers of cellular and humoral immune responses, respectively). When DCs present the processed MART1 protein fragments to CD8 + T cells in complexation with MHC I molecules, the activated CD8 + T cells differentiate into CTLs (the effector T cells) which kill the affected cells with help from CD4 + T cells. 38 Importantly, in the present study, 80% of mice (which lived completely tumor-free lives for 100 days after the first tumor challenge) lived again completely tumor-free lives for 200 days post second tumor challenge. Precise mechanism as to how such long-lasting immune responses against melanoma antigen is induced by the presently Figure S18a,b) . Another important issue deserves mention at this point. Prior studies showed that lipoplexes, in general, are effective in blocking tumor growth in mice due to their capabilities in inducing acute immune responses. 39 Findings in the CTL assay summarized in Figure 7a clearly show that target cell (B16F10) lysis happens only to the extent of ~20% by splenocytes (at E:T ratio of 100:1) of mice immunized with control lipoplex of lipid 1 and p-CMV-\u03b2-Gal plasmid (control DNA vaccine with no encoded tumor antigen). Contrastingly, the degree of target cell lysis by splenocytes of mice immunized with lipoplexes of lipid 1 and p-CMV-MART1 DNA vaccine was found to be ~60% as shown in Figure 7a . Consistent with these findings in the CTL assay, both the amounts of secreted IFN-\u03b3 (markers of cellular immune response) and IL-4 (markers of humoral immune response) for mice immunized with lipid 1:p-CMV MART1 lipoplexes were found to be about seven times higher than the amounts of secreted IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 for mice immunized with control lipoplex of lipid 1 and p-CMV\u03b2-Gal plasmid (Figure 7b ,c based on assay performed 4 weeks after immunization). Thus, nonspecific immune response inducing properties of lipoplexes are unlikely to play major role in the presently described long-lasting immune response. Furthermore, the findings in the newly conducted experiments using CD8 + depleted mice (Figure 8 ) clearly support the notion that CD8 + T cells play an important in mounting long-lasting immune response described herein. Stated differently, the results summarized in Supplementary Figure S13a,b and Figure 7a -c convincingly demonstrated that heightened cellular immune responses play crucial roles behind the remarkably sustained protective immunity against melanoma tumor described herein. We have shown that liposomes of cationic amphiphiles containing a mannose-mimicking shikimoyl-head-group, two n-hexadecyl hydrophobic tails, and a guanidinylated lysine spacer in between the mannose-mimicking head-groups and nonpolar tails hold great promise for direct in vivo targeting of tumor antigen-encoded DNA vaccines to DCs in designing DC-based cancer vaccines. With the availability of the presently described simple liposomal in vivo DC-targeting system, avoiding potentially unsafe viral vectors for targeting DCs under in vivo settings in genetic immunization will now be feasible. The dramatically long-lasting primary immune responses against melanoma in all immunized mice and the remarkable memory responses delineated herein support the future systemic promises of the presently described direct in vivo DC-targeting liposomal DNA vaccine carrier in combating cancer and potentially many other challenging infectious diseases with known pathogenic antigens through direct DNA vaccination in animal and human body.",
