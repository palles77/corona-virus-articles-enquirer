Public health programs have been unable to provide effective and affordable treatment of infectious diseases for the poor. While governments have become more open to private sector contributions to policy objectives, it is rare to find new ventures commercializing healthcare innovations for neglected diseases. Two case studies of entrepreneurial ventures, in the UK and China, provide evidence on how resource-constrained firms mobilize participants in policy-specific ecosystems to achieve their goals of new vaccine development for tuberculosis. Ecosystem analysis reveals how the innovators' business models can align their strategies with national policy objectives.",

This calls for the integration of biomedical innovation into public health programs and new business models on the part of enterprises. Innovations in drugs and vaccines face challenges that include risks attached to technical research and development (R&D), market uncertainty and a long investment horizon for R&D funding. Life science ventures engage in demanding R&D efforts for which funding is scarce (Burki, 2009; Pisano, 2010) . Technology push is insufficient: it is also necessary to pull innovations into the market to provide affordable products that meet the needs of patient populations.",

TB burdens are highest in developing countries, but a rise in drug-resistant tuberculosis in poor areas of developed countries is also a cause for concern. Current TB vaccines used in public health campaigns have advanced little since the first vaccine discoveries in the early 20th century. Multinational pharmaceutical companies have limited interest in innovations and improvements that are not expected to yield sufficient returns to satisfy shareholders (Trouiller et al., 2002) . But in view of the economic and moral imperative to meet the needs of patients worldwide, private sector R&D initiatives are being pushed forward to combat tuberculosis (Harper, 2007) . This requires new sources of funding and new relationships between public sector organizations, philanthropic trusts, medical foundations and entrepreneurial innovators. This paper explores firms attempting to commercialize improved TB vaccines in the light of national biomedical policies.",

An associated question is the influence exerted by policy priorities on the strategies and business models on such firms. We submit that these questions can be usefully addressed by examining evidence on the relationships formed around ecosystem efforts to combat disease. Relevant national programs differ substantially; we explore whether any common themes arise in the commercialization of TB vaccines by new ventures in highly diverse national settings. We inform our analysis using evidence on two case studies of TB vaccine innovators, one based in the United Kingdom and one based in China. The benefits of a comparison of this kind is that if factors can be found that have an impact on outcomes in both contexts, this provides a rationale for further comparison and a search for context-dependent factors that may explain differences between the cases. Finally we examine whether the conceptual approach we propose is likely to illuminate similarities and differences for studies of technology policy and biomedical programs beyond the two cases studied.",

We conducted a crosscase comparison of business models used to implement these innovators' strategies to see how these relate to their distinctive policy contexts. We conceptualize these issues in terms of an innovation ecosystem (Adner, 2006) , but one in which participants form relationships to meet goals together that could not be achieved by them individually. This study demonstrates the application of ecosystem theory and a business model approach to firm strategy that may illuminate issues for innovators elsewhere who aim to leverage policy resources for biomedical and other technology innovations.",

One way to do this may be to join an on-going ecosystem where they can make a contribution to others who reciprocate by supporting their innovations. Our evidence shows how an ecosystem for organizations combating TB was formed anew in the UK by a joint-venture, and how a new Chinese life science firm gained entry to and benefitted from an existing health ecosystem. We use the concept of ecosystem to identify communalities and explore differences between the two case studies.",

A business model renders operational the firm's strategic objectives, which may or may not be made explicit. Teece (2010) has viewed the business model as the way in which a firm is organized to create and secure value in accordance with strategic goals. Participants in an ecosystem create value collectively but this also enables the value generation by individual units that is required for their survival. The joint value thereby created may be social as well as economic. Thus we propose that the innovative firm's business model represents an attempt to respond to and to secure impact on a potentially supportive ecosystem, where strategic goals are difficult or impossible for the venture to achieve on its own.",

In both cases there were collective efforts to create value among a group of organizations linked by common goals in a shared value chain. The business models of the case study firms were designed to create value by integrating their efforts with those of research organizations, philanthropic organizations, clinical trial partnerships and consortia, as shown in Fig. 2 for OETC and Fig. 3 for H&G.

H&G entered an existing ecosystem of mainly Chinese organizations combating TB, but facilitated collaboration and rapid resource and knowledge flows between participants.

Subsequently, tuberculosis was prioritized in the 5-year plan for public health.

H&G's partnerships are domestic and include Chinese R&D partners, Chinese private investors, and local and central government funders.

There are obviously major differences between innovating in a market economy where private finance is the major source of investment, as in the UK, and in a planned market economy like that of China. The Chinese government provided a supportive structure for H&G, though H&G had to earn this support in competition with other private sector innovators in China. Tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis are priority public health concerns for the Chinese government. However public bodies were not the only players; a role for individual innovators was recognized in China. Starting in the late 1990s, the Chinese government had implemented incentives to induce expatriate Chinese scientists and entrepreneurs to return to China. H&G's founder, Dr Li, responded to those incentives. OETC operates in a market economy where funding for biotech ventures typically comes from the private sector in the form of venture capital. However this was not available for vaccines targeted at users in developing countries where economic returns are uncertain. OETC was faced with a challenging situation: \"TB drugs, diagnostics and vaccines all are in need of more public funding support,\" according to Dr Adam Stoten, deputy general manager for OETC.",

In China federal leaders explained their aims as follows: \"We need to follow a policy of making independent innovations and 'leapfrog' advances in key areas of science and technology and supporting and guiding future development,\"-a statement of priorities from Chinese federal leaders. This was the basis for the creation of an ecosystem for TB innovations in China. The relevant guiding principle from the UK Health is Global Framework (Department of Health, 2011) is to \"promote health equity within and between countries through our foreign and domestic policies, particularly through action on the social determinants of health.\" Governments can guide innovation through policy directives. But they are more likely to achieve their goals if they can embed strategic objectives in innovation ecosystems by supporting emerging supply and value chains and helping to pull innovations into use. In the particular cases studied this occurred to a greater extent in China where the priorities of policy and those of the case study firm, H&G, were better aligned than for OETC.",

The Chinese case shows that government policy can mitigate risk and provide infrastructure, funding stability and a safety net for continued efforts in difficult technical areas. The UK case shows the potential of international collaboration and the creation of global ecosystems to promote innovation for demographic groups with unmet needs. New business models are required that build partnerships with other private and public sector organizations in a supportive ecosystem. Further work on business ecosystems bridging public and private sector activities is needed to provide conceptual frameworks and tools to advance work in biomedical commercialization for neglected diseases.",
