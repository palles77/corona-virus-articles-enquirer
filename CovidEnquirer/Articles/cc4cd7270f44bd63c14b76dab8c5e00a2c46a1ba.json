            "text": "Mar mutants of MHV, Ross River virus, rabies virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus became less virulent than their parent strains (Coulon et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 1990; Vrati et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1992) . However, the virulence of mar mutant virus of FIPV in cats remains unexamined. Cats inoculated with strain FIPV 79-1146 frequently develop FIP. Specifically, the mar mutant virus of strain FIPV 79-1146, used to inoculate cats, clearly demonstrates changes in virulence. Furthermore, strain FIPV 79-1146 is suitable for examining the correlation between the proliferation of FIPV in monocytes/macrophages and its virulence in cats because of the high proliferation of strain FIPV 79-1146 in monocytes/macrophages. Corapi et al. (1995) and Hohdatsu et al. (1993) reported that FIPV 79-1146-neutralizing MAb exhibited potent ADE activity in macrophages. Their report suggested that neutralizing and antibody-dependent enhancing epitopes are present in the same region in FIPV 79-1146, but this hypothesis has not been verified. We revealed that MAbs which lost neutralizing activity against mar mutant viruses also lost ADE activity, showing that neutralizing and antibody-dependent enhancing epitopes are present in the same region of the S protein in FIPV 79-1146, as hypothesized. On the other hand, MAb which neutralized FECV 79-1683 on fcwf-4 cells did not exhibit ADE activity on macrophages. The reason for the absence of ADE activity for FECV 79-1683 is unclear. FECV 79-1683 Table 2 . exhibits 90% or higher amino acid sequence homologies with structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) and ORF 7a of the FIPV 79-1146 strain, but homology with non-structural proteins other than ORF 7b was less than 65%. Moreover, non-structural protein-encoding ORF 1ab of FECV 79-1683 has not been analyzed. To investigate the difference in ADE activity between FECV 79-1683 and FIPV 79-1146, the investigation of differences in the replication mode including the cellular invasion process in monocytes/macrophages is necessary. Corapi et al. (1995) and Kida et al. (1999) investigated the neutralizing epitope in FIPV 79-1146 using mar mutant viruses. They divided the neutralizing epitope in the S1 region of S protein into A1 (residues 542-591) and A2 (residues 643-656) sites, but it was unclear whether the A1 and A2 sites are involved in the replicating ability of FIPV 79-1146 in monocytes/macrophages. We confirmed that the viral replicating ability in monocytes/macrophages was reduced in viruses with two or more amino acid mutations in the A1 and A2 sites (mar 5-7-2.C2, mar 5-7-2.7-4-1, and mar 6-4-2.7-4-1), suggesting that the A1 and A2 sites of FIPV 79-1146 are important for viral replication in monocytes/macrophages.",

It has been pro-posed that FIPV becomes less virulent when the 7b gene is deleted (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . In FIPV, 7b gene is easily deleted after viral passage in cells. However, no deletion was found in the 7b gene of mar 6-4-2.C2 and mar 7-4-1.C2, in spite of undergoing the same number of passages as mar 5-7-2.C1 and mar 5-7-2.C2.

The function of protein encoded by the 7b gene (7b protein) in FIPV-infected cats is unclear. A non-structural protein of FCoV similar to 7b protein, 3c protein, has been suggested to be involved in viral transfer from intestinal epithelial cells to macrophages (Chang et al., 2010) , but the essential functions of 3c and 7b proteins have not been analyzed.

In FCoV, multiple mutations induced by several passages have been observed in FIPV strain Black (FIPV Black: type I FCoV) (Tekes et al., 2008) . However, a few mutations were found in genome despite the fact that mar mutant viruses were generated from FIPV 79-1146 (type II FCoV) during several passages, independently of each other in different cultures in the presence of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Although the reason for this contradiction is unclear, a difference in the fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase between types I and II FCoV may have been involved. Vignuzzi et al. (2006) suggested that genomic diversity decreases in viruses with high-fidelity RNAdependent RNA polymerase. Actually, many gene mutations were observed among type I FCoV strains, but no mutation was detected in type II FCoV.

However, mar 5-7-2.C1 becomes less virulent in cats, although it proliferated well in monocytes/macrophages in vitro. This result is inconsistent with a theory that the proliferation of FCoV in monocytes/macrophages correlates with virulence. Pedersen (2009) reported that oral inoculation using strain FIPV 79-1146 caused FIP in 92.6% of cats, and intraperitoneal inoculation, 100%. In contrast, oral inoculation using strain FIPV UCD4 caused FIP in 0% of cats, and intraperitoneal inoculation, 37.5%. Thus, mar 5-7-2.C1 may also become virulent via other inoculation routes. In the future, the association among the proliferation in monocytes/macrophages, onset of FIP, and the developmental mechanism via a parenteral transmission route should be examined using strain mar 5-7-2.C1 and other mar mutant viruses. In addition, it is necessary to prepare MAb 5-7-2-resistant mutant virus without the mutation of regions other than the neutralizing epitope and perform a similar experiment.",

From these results, FCoV, including FIPV, is regarded as a group of various virulent viruses.

For example, neutralizing epitope-binding peptidomimetics may inhibit FIPV infection of monocytes/macrophages without exhibiting ADE activity. However, the neutralizing or antibody-dependent enhancing epitope of type I FIPV, accounting for about 80% of field FIPV, has not been identified, unlike type II FIPV. To prepare a therapeutic drug targeting the neutralizing epitope, identification of the neutralizing epitope in type I FIPV is necessary. Recently, a method for preparing type I FCoV employing a reverse genetics system has also been established (Tekes et al., 2008) .
