Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 catalysts exhibited high bactericidal activity at room temperature in water with no need for any light or electrical power input. Dissolved oxygen which can be catalyzed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found to be essential for the strong bactericidal activities of the catalysts. Decomposition of the cell wall leading to leakage of the intracellular component and the complete lysis of the whole cell were directly observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The resultant change in cell permeability was confirmed by potassium ion leakage. The different morphological changes between E. coli cells treated with the catalysts and Ag + were also observed. The formation of ROS involved in the bactericidal process by AgCl/Al 2 O 3 was confirmed by addition of catalase and \u00c5 OH scavenger. Higher temperature and pH value were found to have positive effect on the bactericidal activity of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 . All these results indicated that the bactericidal effect of the catalyst was a synergic action of ROS and Ag + , not an additive one. A possible mechanism is proposed.",

Therefore, disinfection of pathological microbes in water is very important to provide a sanitary environment and thus maintain human health [1, 2] . A variety of chemical and physical techniques may be used for such disinfections. The most widely used methods in water treatment systems are chlorination, ozonation and germicidal lamps (UV) [3] [4] [5] . However, there are some disadvantages associated with each of the method. For example, potential formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts -chloroform and bromate, has been reported as a drawback of chlorination and ozonation.",

Generally, TiO 2 based bactericidal materials need UV light or ultrasonic irradiation to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) [3, 5] . On the other hand, silver nanoparticles and compounds containing silver are attractive because of their strong antibacterial activity, high stability, and wide antibacterial spectrum without any energy input [1, [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, so far, the mechanism underlying the bactericidal activity of silver loaded materials remains generally unclear [1, 8] . Some reports have suggested that the antibacterial activity of silver loaded materials is realized via the elution of silver ions into the system containing microorganisms, leading to cell death through cell penetration and binding at specific sites to DNA, RNA, respiratory enzymes and cellular protein [10] [11] [12] . Others attribute the bactericidal activity of silver loaded materials to catalytic oxidation involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1, [6] [7] [8] .",

The microbes are completely inactivated in 5 min on Ag/ Al 2 O 3 surface at room temperature in air. We have proposed a catalytic oxidation mechanism that ROS as bactericide in the bactericidal process are formed on the catalyst surface by activating adsorbed oxygen in air [9, 13] . In this paper, we focus our attention on the bactericidal activity of Ag/Al 2 O 3 in water to further identify the inactivation mechanism as a successive work to the former study [13] , since the situation is very different from that in air. AgCl/Al 2 O 3 was also used in this study because of its low amount of eluted Ag + , and thus is applicable to water resources without having adverse health effects. The objective of this study is to confirm the catalytic disinfection mechanism and primarily investigate the feasibility of this material in water.",

This phenomenon was similar to that of E. coli cells damaged by H 2 O 2 , as reported by Shin et al. [21] . For the cells treated in deionized water (shown in Fig. 2e and f), the whole cells completely disappeared, and nothing was observed except for a large number of fibriform cell pieces. Furthermore, some electron-dense granules adherent to the fibriform pieces can be clearly observed (arrows in Fig. 2e and f) . As reported by Feng et al. [20] , some of the stimulated proteins produced by the cells would agglomerate after the attack by silver ions, surrounding the nuclear region. Further investigation indicated that the DNA molecules became condensed like a twisted string losing their replication abilities. According to these conclusions, the fibriform cell pieces observed in Fig. 2e and f were possibly due to lysis of the bacterial cells leading to leakage of damaged DNA molecules [22] . This implies that a stronger oxidizing intermediate was formed to destroy the cells more thoroughly.",

Fig. 4 shows the effect of nitrogen and oxygen gas bubbling on the bactericidal activity of the catalyst in physiological saline at room temperature. The bubbling was continued throughout the treatment period. Clearly, the inactivation of E. coli by silver loaded alumina under aerobic conditions ( Fig. 4e and f ) was more efficient than that under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4b and c) . This suggested that ROS generated on the catalyst surface is an essential factor for the expression of the bactericidal activity in the presence of catalysts [1, 8] . The same conclusion was reached in deionized water by our previous work [6, 9] . However, without the presence of Ag + , the bactericidal activity decreased in physiological saline even under aerobic conditions, compared with that in deionized water (Fig. 1d and e) . Furthermore, the bactericidal activities of Ag/Al 2 O 3 and AgCl/Al 2 O 3 did not show a sharp difference and were still stronger than that of the Al 2 O 3 host.

As can be seen from Fig. 5 , with the addition of 286 units/ml catalase the bactericidal activity of the catalyst was inhibited drastically, while as shown in the blank experiment, the same concentration of catalase itself has no effect on the bacterial survival. This result indicates that the formation of H 2 O 2 play an important role during the bactericidal process. The addition of catalase had two effects [1] : one was transformation of H 2 O 2 to water, the other was interception of the route of formation of \u00c5 OH, because \u00c5 OH was formed by the decomposition of H 2 O 2 . As have been reported [1, 8] , the transitional metals, such as silver and ferric ions could catalyze the oxidizing action of H 2 O 2 by forming \u00c5 OH and/or \u00c5 O \u00c0 2 , through a so-called Fenton-like reaction. As a result, \u00c5 OH and other ROS such as \u00c5 O \u00c0 2 and H 2 O 2 , simultaneously contribute to the efficient inactivation of E. coli cells.",

This may be the reason why the time required for complete inactivation by the catalyst in physiological saline was much longer than that in deionized water. Since the combined use of H 2 O 2 and Ag + exhibited improved bactericidal effects compared to H 2 O 2 and Ag + alone [27] [28] [29] , the simultaneous presence of H 2 O 2 and Ag + in deionized water could adequately explain the much higher bactericidal activity compared with that in physiological saline. We supposed that H 2 O 2 was first formed on the catalyst surface by activating adsorbed O 2 , then H 2 O 2 was further catalyzed to a stronger ROS ( \u00c5 OH, etc.) by eluted Ag + . Since the quantitative analysis of the generated ROS is complex, an indirect method by \u00c5 OH scavenger was used to prove the production of ROS.",

However, the bactericidal activity increased obviously with pH increasing in the presence of AgCl/ Al 2 O 3 . Furthermore, the bactericidal activity did not increase obviously from 6.0 to 8.0 of the pH value. Since the charges of the catalyst and bacteria are both closely related to pH value, zeta Fig. 8b . Though the surface of the bacteria was positively charged and the surface of the catalyst was negatively charged in the range of pH 3.0-5.5, the bactericidal activity of the catalyst was quite low in acidic condition as shown in Fig. 8a . On the other hand, in the range of pH 5.5-12, the surface of the bacteria and catalyst were both negatively charged, whereas the bactericidal activity of the catalyst was high when pH > 6.0 as shown in Fig. 8a . Therefore, the electrostatic attraction between E. coli and the catalyst did not play an important role in the bactericidal process. In other words, the effect of E. coli adsorption onto the catalyst surface on the inactivation of E. coli was neglectable in our experimental condition with pH 6.0, which indicated that a catalytic oxidation was involved during the bactericidal process.",

The higher the pH value was, the more rapid decomposition of H 2 O 2 was, and the stronger the catalytic oxidation ability was. All these results could well explain the higher bactericidal activity of AgCl/Al 2 O 3 at higher pH value, since the involvement of H 2 O 2 has also been observed in our experiment as mentioned above (see Fig. 5 ). However, when the pH value was too high, the formation of H 2 O 2 (pK a = 11.56) was blocked, and the catalytic oxidation ability would not increase any more [35] . It solidly confirmed the catalytic oxidation mechanism mediated by different kind of ROS. Furthermore, the high bactericidal activity in neutral condition suggested that this catalyst is a very potential material to apply in drinking water disinfection.",

The fixed silver species and/or eluted Ag + strongly enhanced the bactericidal activity of the catalyst by catalyzing adsorbed O 2 to ROS, such as H 2 O 2 , \u00c5 OH and \u00c5 O \u00c0 2 . ROS with strongly oxidizing properties resulted in destruction of the cell wall of the bacteria and finally the complete lysis of the bacterial cell. The catalytically bactericidal effect should be considered as a synergic action of ROS and Ag + , not as an additive one. Since the bactericidal activity of the catalyst increased with temperature increasing, and showed good performance at neutral pH value condition in water, it may provide a novel approach for the design of other bactericidal materials applied in drinking water disinfection. Further study and direct proof of ROS are needed to clarify the details of these actions.",
