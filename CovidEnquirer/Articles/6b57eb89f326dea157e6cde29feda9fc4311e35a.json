We have written this section with the needs of designers and developers of biosurveillance systems in mind. Therefore, in addition to describing the systems, we highlight data relevant to biosurveillance and any technical or administrative barriers to obtaining the data. We offer our opinion about which systems provide the most immediate and the most long-term potential for biosurveillance. We suggest questions that a biosurveillance organization should ask a healthcare system or hospital when discussing options for creating electronic data exchange. For readers that have limited time, our conclusion will be that HL7 (Health Level 7)-message routers offer the most immediate potential for bidirectional data exchange between biosurveillance organizations and the healthcare system, and that point-of-care (POC) systems represent the future of biosurveillance. Table 6 .2 summarizes the systems that we will discuss--the data they contain, their market penetration, and their potential role in biosurveillance. As a general rule, the larger the hospital or healthcare organization, the more likely it will have each system. Figure 6 .1 illustrates the information-system architecture of a typical hospital (or multihospital system). At the heart of the architecture is an HL7-message router. 3 An HL7-message router is a communication hub that transmits information between information systems, both within the healthcare system and outside of it. HL7-message routers are commercial off-the-shelf products supplied by many vendors (there is an open-source HL7-message router called Jengine available at http://www.jengine.org/ and an HL7 listener, which can receive messages from a hospital HL7-message router, at openrods.sourceforge.net). They are also called integration engines. Healthcare systems often employ HL7 interface engineers and network engineers to configure and maintain these systems around the clock.",

            "text": "The importance of the HL7-message router for biosurveillance is twofold. First, many clinical information systems send data to the HL7-message router ( Figure 6 .1). The data include patient chief complaints, dictations, results of laboratory tests, and results of radiological examinations. The information systems send these data to the HL7-message router in real time, and the HL7-message router can forward these data to biosurveillance organizations without delay. If a computer in a biosurveillance organization is temporarily incapable of receiving the data, the HL7-message router will queue the data for up to a week until the computer becomes available. Second, an HL7-message router can support bidirectional, real-time communication between computers in a healthcare system and computers in a biosurveillance organization by using the 3 The term HL7 (Health Level 7) refers to the dominant messaging standard in health-care computing. Briefly, the HL7 standard was developed in the 1980's by a coalition of information system vendors to allow their systems to more readily exchange data. We discuss the HL7 standard in detail in Chapter 32. query message type. 4 For these reasons, HL7 messaging is a core element of emerging biosurveillance IT standards, as we discuss in Chapter 32. It is worthwhile to point out that HL7 defines a communications protocol at the application layer and does not address the transport layer (e.g., TCP/IE HTTE RS-232). Therefore, it is possible for two systems to speak HL7 at the application layer but still not be able to physically communicate. Healthcare organizations that own multiple hospitals and physician practices may use an HL7-message router to integrate the data systems of these geographically diverse practices. In these settings, the HL7-message router represents a single point of integration between a biosurveillance organization and scores of hospitals. For example, when the Utah Department of Health deployed the RODS system for the 2002 Winter Olympics, it created a single connection to the Intermountain Healthcare System HL7-message router, enabling it to collect registration data from nine emergency departments and 19 acute care facilities (e.g., urgent cares, instacares and now cares). It created a second connection to the University of Utah HL7-message router to add one emergency department, one urgent care, and the polyclinic located in the Olympic Village to the biosurveillance system (Gesteland et al., 2002 , Tsui et al., 2002 .",

Electronic patient registration is nearly ubiquitous in the United States, especially in emergency departments and hospital-based or hospital-associated office practices and large health maintenance organizations. The registration clerk enters the reason for visit (also called the chief complaint) at the time of registration, along with the patient's age, gender, and home address. Syndromic surveillance systems analyze de-identified versions of these data (without patient name and with home address information limited to zip code) (Espino and Wagner, 2001; Lober et al., 2001; Tsui et al., 2001; Wagner et al., 2001) . The main advantage of registration data for biosurveillance is its widespread availability in the United States and inherent timeliness. If a healthcare organization has an HL7-message router, chances are good that the registration system sends messages to it and that it can de-identify and forward these data to a biosurveillance organization in real time.",

Third-party payers such as insurance companies require that a hospital encode this information by using either Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) codes, a process that in many healthcare settings is done manually by professional coders. This process may introduce a several-day delay between the time the patient is seen and the diagnoses are available in a billing system. Billing data are often routed through an HL7-message router, and the combination of the widespread availability of both billing systems and HL7-message routers makes billing data highly available for biosurveillance. We note that thirdparty payers consolidate billing data from many hospitals and healthcare providers.

He promulgated the use of standards for the naming of laboratory tests and the reporting of their results (discussed in detail in Chapter 32).

A radiology department performs radiographic, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other examinations of patients. The results of many of these examinations are highly relevant to biosurveillance. Clinicians use radiological examinations to diagnose infectious diseases (e.g., pneumonias). The reports include the diagnostic impression of the radiologist (e.g.,\"the combination of mediastinal widening and pneumonic infiltrate is consistent with pulmonary anthrax\"). Unfortunately, in the majority of practices, the radiologist dictates his report and it is subsequently transcribed; thus, the reports can be delayed a day or more by the transcription process and are transcribed in English (or another language). Researchers in medical informatics have investigated methods for processing dictated radiology reports to extract information about patient characteristics, such as presence or absence of pneumonia (see Chapter 17) (Jain et al., 1996; Knirsch et al., 1998; Chapman and Haug, 1999; Hripcsak et al., 1999; Fiszman et al., 2000a) .",

A Poe system facilitates the electronic capture of key diagnostic data (and usually in a computer-interpretable form rather than English). POC systems typically include decision-support capabilities (discussed in Chapter 13) that alert clinicians to potential drug-drug interactions and even suggest diagnoses. It is possible to program the underlying computer decisionsupport system to notice that a patient may have pneumonia and Gram-positive rods in a blood culture (an example of automatic case finding) and alert the clinician to consider a diagnosis of inhalational anthrax (and even report this suspicion automatically to a health department). High degrees of suspicion based on regional events can also be incorporated into the computer analysis.

A good ISCP also requires \"shoe-leather\" epidemiotogy (i.e., daily ward rounds to speak with personnel providing direct patient care) and some form of \"post-discharge surveillance\" to detect infections in patients who have already left the hospital. The combined result of all these processes is a list of potential patients to investigate that day. The staff reviews this list to organize and prioritize the work for the day. The staff collects additional information for each patient from hospital information systems, for example, accessing a single system or multiple systems to review radiology reports, physician dictations, medication records, and other results of laboratory testing.

In the 1840s, puerperal or childbirth fever, a bacterial infection of the female genital tract after childbirth, was taking the lives of up to 30% of women who gave birth in hospitals. Women who gave birth at home remained relatively unaffected. Semmelweis observed that women examined by student doctors who had not washed their hands after leaving the autopsy room had very high death rates. When a colleague who had received a scalpel cut died of infection, Semmelweis concluded that puerperal fever was septic and contagious. He ordered students to wash their hands with chlorinated lime before examining patients; as a result, the maternal death rate in his hospital was reduced from 12% to 1% in two years. Source: funkandwagnalls.com Copyright 1999 Copyright , 2000 The other responsibilities of a ISCP include (1) standards-setting and accrediting body in health care. Since 1951, JCAHO has maintained state-of-the-art standards that focus on improving the quality and safety of care provided by healthcare organizations. Infection control is a critical component of safe, quality health care. JCAHO is becoming more active, perhaps even militant, as a result of increasing awareness of the impact of HCAIs on the cost and quality of health care. Effective January 1, 2005, JCAHO established a New Patient Safety Goal (the seventh) in the area of infection control, which it promulgates as a set of standards that includes the following: accountability of the CEO of a healthcare organization for compliance and fiscal support of an ISCP; staffing and training of ISCP; communication and coordination with health departments and other community organizations; clear command and control (delegated authority); and surveillance, and monitoring of efficacy if its infection control programs (JCAHO, 2004) . JCAHO is very influential. As previously discussed, its influence derives from the Medicare Act of 1965, which included JCAHO accreditation as one basis for Medicare reimbursement. The most recent Accreditation Manual for Hospitals issued by JCAHO includes a set of scoring guidelines on which the compliance of a hospital will be judged. To obtain the highest score, a hospital must provide evidence of having switched from processes such as surveillance of antibiotic use and nosocomial infections as ends in themselves to measures of patient outcomes as indicators of hospital performance. To link patient outcomes such as length of stay, days or morbidity, mortality, and costs will require substantial collection of data, or integration of data, already being collected by registration systems and billing systems.",

However, the Stark law includes a provision that permits the Secretary of HHS to exempt a specific financial relationship if he or she determines that the relationship does not pose a risk for abuse. Thus, the Secretary of HHS in 2004 made an exception for provision of an EMR when the EMR is necessary to connect to a community-wide health information system. 12 This action by the Secretary of HHS may encourage the development of community-wide efforts to exchange patient data from the outpatient setting and the provision of EMRs to physicians by organizations that participate in the community-wide effort. 13 We discuss some of these community-wide efforts next.",

As we discuss in Chapter 8, laboratory test orders and results are highly automated in most hospitals. There are many firms that are in the business of creating interfaces between laboratory information systems and other information systems in hospitals. Although it is true that significant effort is required to create an interface, the effort is finite and the cost is in the neighborhood of $100,000 for a comprehensive interface (one that covers all laboratory tests). The cost would likely be lower for an interface that covered only results of interest to biosurveillance. Even were the cost to be as high as $100,000, the total cost for 10,000 interfaces (more than the number of hospitals in the United States) would be $1 billion dollars. One of the authors in fact presented this option to President Bush in February 2002. The President's DHHS advisor quickly interjected that DHHS already had a plan to send $1 billion to the states to address the problem of bioterrorism. Since then, the federal government has provided several billion dollars to the states for bioterrorism preparedness.",
