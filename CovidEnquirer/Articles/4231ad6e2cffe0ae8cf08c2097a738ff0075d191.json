            "text": "How proteins are sorted to their proper location within the cell is one of the most intriguing questions in cell biology. The answers to this question will enable us to begin to understand how a cell maintains and regulates the structural and functional distinctiveness of its intracellular membrane compartments. A significant amount of progress has been made in understanding many aspects of the general problem of protein sorting. The mechanisms which discriminate between proteins that remain in the cytoplasm and those that are either to be secreted or to become integral membrane proteins continue to be elucidated in great detail (for review, see Lodish et al, 1981; Sabatini et al, 1982; Walter et al, 1984; Wickner and Lodish, 1985) . Recent studies have shown that many nuclear-encoded proteins destined for the mitochondria (for review, see Hay et al., 1984) or the chloroplast (for review, see Schmidt et al., 1980) are synthesized as preproteins with an amino-terminal extension which acts as a signal for the posttranslational uptake of the precursors into these organelles. In the case of lysosomal hydrolases in fibroblasts, it has been shown that appropriately oriented mannose 6-phosphate moieties on the enzymes act as one of the signals which results in the sorting of these proteins into lysosomes (for review, see Sly and Fischer, 1982; Sly, 1985) .",

These results are incompatible with the hypothesis that vesicles bud off from a specialized region of the ER and merely contain a sample of the luminal content proteins and the ER membrane proteins. Therefore, it has been proposed that this type of sorting may also be a receptor-mediated process. In addition, Kalderon et al. (1984) have described a short amino acid sequence of SV40 T antigen, Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val, which appears to specify the nuclear localization of that protein and which can mediate the transport to the nucleus of chimeric proteins which have been constructed to contain this sequence. This chapter describes experiments which have as their ultimate goal to test the hypothesis that the proteins of the internal membranes of the cell have analogous sequence or structural features which enable the cell to sort them to their correct subcellular compartments (Nelson and Robinson, 1983) .",

Rose and colleagues were able to examine the effects of alterations in various regions of VSV G protein on G protein sorting. For example, it was demonstrated that alteration of the cytoplasmic domain produced two classes of mutations: Class I, in which G protein transport was arrested and G protein accumulated in an early subcellular compartment, and Class II, in which a reduced rate of transport was observed with G protein eventually reaching the cell surface. The existence of the Class I alterations was interpreted to provide preliminary evidence for the existence of an \"appropriate\" cytoplasmic domain leading to ER localization.",

Furthermore, in studies of the transmembrane region, it was demonstrated the deletion of 2,4, or 6 amino acids in the 20 amino acid transmembrane region had no significant effect on transport, while deletions of 8 or 12 amino acids resulted in a G protein whose transport was blocked in the Golgi. Deletion of the entire transmembrane region resulted in a G protein which accumulated in the ER and was secreted only slowly. In other studies, it was found that the incorporation of a charged amino acid in the middle of the transmembrane region blocked transport of G protein to the surface, but not membrane insertion. Finally, studies in which a chimeric protein was created, containing the coding sequences for growth hormone fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of G protein, demonstrated that this construction was only transported to the Golgi and that the signal for secretion of growth hormone was not operative when it was membrane bound. Rizzolo et al. (1985) and Guan et al. (1985) have studied growth hormone-viral glycoprotein chimeric molecules to gain insights into the role of both luminal and cytoplasmic protein sequences in protein sorting. Although some of the results from these studies are not easily interpretable, it is clear that both luminal and cytoplasmic sequences influence protein sorting either directly as signals or indirectly through altered conformations of the chimeric molecules. In general, a major difficulty encountered in carrying this work further has been that alterations in protein sequences of membrane proteins have produced negative effects, i.e., the transport of the protein is blocked at an intermediate step in the transport pathway. It is difficult, therefore, to determine the direct cause of this transport lesion. It could be that sorting signals have been specifically altered and that the altered protein is no longer recognized by the cellular sorting machinery. It also could be the case, however, that the altered protein merely precipitates more easily in the cell and thus becomes physically unable to be transported. In this regard, it now appears that the retention in the ER of the altered forms of many normally exported proteins is due to their inability to fold properly. In this state, they are retained in the ER by their association with the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) (Haas and Wabl, 1983; Bole et al., 1986; Gething et al., 1986) . Guan et al. (1985) have observed that the addition of functional carbohydrate attachment sites to the growth hormone sequence of a growth hormone-VSV G protein chimera, which accumulated in the Golgi apparatus, provided this molecule with a signal for protein transport to the plasma membrane. Thus, these workers have produced positive effects on transport by altering the luminal portion of a hybrid molecule.",

Were the ERps preferentially retained in the ER or did they leave the ER with the rest of the proteins being transported from the ER only to be returned by a recycling mechanism? Based on the composition and structural organization of the Golgi apparatus and its well-estab-lished role in the sorting of other membrane proteins, it had been postulated (Rothman, 1980) that ERps are sorted in a process analogous to fractional distillation. This idea has been invoked recently by Munro and Pelham (1987) to explain their observations concerning a retention signal for a luminal ER protein (see below). According to this model, the ER is not a site for protein sorting. Instead, all proteins are first transported to the Golgi, and those proteins which are destined for the ER are recovered from the cis-most stacks of this organelle by recycling. Our studies investigating the sorting of six major ERps from murine plasmactyoma cells, ERp49, ERp59, ERp60, ERp61, ERp72, and ERp99, have produced no evidence to indicate that these proteins ever leave the ER (Lewis et al, 1985b (Lewis et al, , 1986 . Similar conclusions have been reached in studies of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Brands et al, 1985) , glucosidase II (Brands et al, 1985) , and ribophorin I (Rosenfeld et al, 1984) and in studies utilizing tripeptides containing the acceptor sequence for Asn-linked glycosylation to examine the rate of bulk flow from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (Wieland et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "The evidence against a recycling mechanism for ER localization can be summarized by three general observations. For those ERps with N-linked oligosaccharides, it has been determined that the oligosaccharides are of the high-mannose type and are sensitive to endo H. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the ERps never leave the ER for the Golgi where the oligosaccharides can be processed into complex, endo H-resistant moieties. In addition, in experiments where protein transport was assayed directly by sucrose gradient fractionation of pulse-labeled cell extracts, no movement of the proteins from the ER to the Golgi could be detected. Finally,, the secretion of glycopeptides is faster than that of any known secretory proteins (Wieland, 1987) . Since much evidence suggests that oligosaccharides are not signals for transport (Hickman and Kornfeld, 1978; Keller and Swank, 1978; Olden et al., 1978; Struck et al, 1978; Bell-Quint et al, 1981; Sidman et al, 1981; Gotlieb and Wallace, 1982) , it appears that no signal is required for rapid and efficient transport from the ER to the cell surface. Thus, the unique protein composition of the ER appears to be established and maintained by the selective export of non-ER proteins. This suggests that the ER is the initial site for the sorting of ER membrane proteins and that ERps must contain specific retention signals.",

Many ER proteins and enzymes have been studied in a large number of laboratories. ER proteins are involved in the cotranslational insertion of membrane proteins into the ER membrane (for review, see Walter et al., 1984) as well as the cotranslational translocation of lysosomal and secretory proteins across the ER membrane (Gilmore and Blobel, 1985) . In the majority of cases, the cotranslational insertion or translocation of a protein in or through the membrane is accompanied by the removal of an amino-terminal signal peptide by the ER signal peptidase. Evans et al. (1986) have recently described the purification of a complex of microsomal proteins which contain signal peptidase activity. Other ER-associated activites include the enzymes of glycerolipid synthesis (for review, see Bell and Coleman, 1980; , the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and transfer of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide involved in N-linked glycosylation of nascent proteins (Snider and Robbins, 1982; Snider and Rogers, 1984) , and the enzymes which process the newly transferred oligosaccharide, such as glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and the ER \u03b1-mahnosidase (for review, see Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) . In addition, protein disulfide isomerase (for review, see Freedman and Hillson, 1980) and prolyl hydroxylase (for review, see Kivirikko and Myllyla, 1980) are confined to the ER.",

            "text": "For the purpose of this chapter, we confine our attention to those ERps whose structure and/or sorting are the best characterized. The structural features of these ERps are given in Table I . Cytochrome b 5 and NADHcytochrome b$ reductase have been included in Table I because both components have been shown to be enriched in the ER. They are, however, present in other cell fractions including the Golgi apparatus, the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. It is possible that the reason for this wide distribution can be found in the way in which these proteins are made and the way in which they subsequently interact with the intracellular membranes. Cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase are synthesized on free poly somes, released into the cyto-plasm^ nd the completed polypeptides are then incorporated into membranes posttranslationally (Okada et al., 1982; Anderson et al., 1983) . Analysis of the amino acid sequence of cytochrome b 5 has led to the idea that this protein interacts with the membrane bilayer by virtue of its hydrophobic carboxy-terminal region (Ozols and Gerard, 1977) . What is known about the structure of NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase is consistent with a similar conclusion for this membrane component (Tajima et al., 1979) . Thus, the finding that cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome bs reductase are enriched in the ER may be the result of the interaction of these proteins with proteins of the ER membrane before they themselves are incorporated into the membrane.

A protein is classified as transmembrane if the protein is shown to be available to protease in intact microsomes and the protein possesses an oligosaccharide or if a substantial proteolytic fragment which is detected in the absence of detergent is also degraded in the presence of detergent. c The number of endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides is not known. d Glycosylation of El is a posttranslational event. It is not inhibited by tunicamycin, 2deoxyglucose, or 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose, all of which are inhibitors of asparaginelinked glycosylation. Analysis of the El carbohydrate and its sensitivity to mild alkaline treatment suggest that there is an O-glycosidic linkage between the oligosaccharide and the polypeptide. O-Linked glycosylation of El presumably occurs after the virus assembles and subsequently migrates to the Golgi apparatus. Glycosylation of El increases its molecular weight by about 3,000 (Niemann and Klenk, 1981) .",

We are interested in defining those features of ER proteins which are responsible for this arrest and determining how these signals accomplish the ER localization of these proteins.",

Two common features of the luminal domain which could influence sorting are the presence of an uncleaved signal peptide or the presence of an N-linked oligossaccharide moiety. It has been reported that HMG-CoA reductase (Brown and Simoni, 1984) , cytochrome P-450 (Bar-Nun et al, 1980) , NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase (Okada et al, 1982) , epoxide hydrolase (Okada et al, 1982) , rotavirus NCVP5 (Both et al, 1983) , and coronavirus El lack cleavable signal peptides, while the signal peptides of rotavirus VP7 (Ericson et al., 1983) , adenovirus E19 (Persson et al., 1980; Wold et al., 1985) , and ribophorin I and II are cleaved (Rosenfeld et al., 1984) . Our own experiments have shown that ERp99, ERp72, ERp61, ERp60, and protein disulfide isomerase (ERp59) have cleavable signal peptides (R. Mazzarella, unpublished results) . Thus, it appears that the mere possession of an uncleaved signal peptide is not sufficient to determine the sorting properties of ER proteins. In addition, our finding that, of the six ER proteins we have studied, only ERp99 is a glycoprotein (Lewis et al., 1985a (Lewis et al., ,b, 1986 taken together with analogous studies of ER glycoproteins such as HMG-CoA reductase (Liscum et al., 1983) , the ribophorins (Kreibich et al., 1983a; Rosenfeld et al., 1984) , hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Hino and Minakami, 1982; Brands et al., 1985) , glucosidase II (Hino and Rothman, 1985) , prolyl hydroxylase (Kedersha et al., 1985a,b) , egasyn (Swank and Paigen, 1973) , adenovirus E19 (Kornfeld and Wold, 1981) , and rotavirus VP7 (Kabcenell and Atkinson, 1985) and NCVP5 (Both et al, 1983) indicates that the mere presence or absence of an N-linked oligosaccharide is not sufficient to define an ER protein.",

Liscum et al. (1985) have proposed that the seven membrane spanning domains of HMG-CoA reductase may be involved in the localization of this protein to the cholesterol-poor membranes of the ER. Recently, Kabcenell and Atkinson (1985) and Poruchynsky et al. (1985) have described studies investigating the subcellular localization and intracellular sorting of the VP7 glycoprotein of rotavirus SAH. These workers have shown that while wild-type VP7 is confined to the ER in infected cells or in cells transfected with expression vectors containing the VP7 gene, it is possible to construct mutants of VP7 which are transported to the Golgi and eventually secreted. Specifically, it appears that alterations in the second hydrophobic region near the amino terminus will abolish the ER localization of VP7. Thus, these authors conclude that this hydrophobic domain provides both a membrane anchor and a positive signal for ER localization. It will be interesting to see if this conclusion can be extended to the membrane-spanning regions of other ERps as they are cloned and subjected to mutational analysis.",

Our results with ERp72, ERp60, ERp61, and ERp59 (Lewis et al, 1985b (Lewis et al, , 1986 taken together with studies of protein disulfide isomerase (Lambert and Freedman, 1985) , prolyl hydroxylase (Olsen et al, 1973) , egasyn (Swank and Paigen, 1973) , and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (Haas and Wabl, 1983; Munro and Pelham, 1986) , all of which exhibit a predominantely luminal orientation, indicate that a cytoplasmic or luminal orientation is also not the sole property by which an ERp is defined.",

In addition, Munro and Pelham (1987) have shown that the C-terminal KDEL sequence is necessary to retain the luminal protein GRP78 in the ER compartment. Finally studies by Paabo et al (1987) on the transmembrane protein E19 encoded by the adenovirus genome illustrate the importance of cytoplasmic domains in the retention of ER proteins. The E19 protein has only a 15-residue cytoplasmic tail, whereas the luminal domain consists of 104 amino acids and two N-linked carbohydrates. Shortening the cytoplasmic tail to 7 amino acids abolishes the ER localization of this protein and this mutant E19 protein becomes transported to the plasma membrane.",

On the other hand, the protein may lack features which allow it to be transported out of the ER. It may be missing a suitably positioned or oriented oligosaccharide or it may lack cytoplasmically exposed structural features that are recognized by the cellular sorting machinery.

These data indicate that ERp99 may play an important structural and/or functional role in the ER membrane. In addition, we should be able to obtain amounts of purified ERp99 which would be sufficient for physical and chemical studies designed to follow up our observations concerning the sorting properties of normal and mutated ERp99. We have shown that ERp99 is a transmembrane glycoprotein. Thus, we will be able to compare the information we obtain about its structure and sorting with that Fig. 1 .

The amount of ERp99 in the gradient fractions was assayed by immunoprecipitation. Nearly all of ERp99 was always recovered from the densest of the ER fractions, well separated from the Golgi region. This restricted localization of ERp99 was entirely consistent with the results obtained from subcellular fractionation studies. These results suggest that ERp99 may be exclusively localized in the RER. There was no evidence from this experiment that ERp99 ever leaves the ER, in that the gradient distribution of ERp99 was consistent throughout the 180-min chase. We feel, therefore, that it is unlikely that transport to and recycling from the Golgi apparatus plays a major role in the sorting of ER proteins. It is, of course, impossible to exclude this mechanism for all ER proteins, and it would be useful to apply these tests to newly identified ERps as they become available.",

This carbohydrate moiety could be detected at the earliest sampling time and remained endo H sensitive throughout the chase. The nature of the ERp99 carbohydrate was determined by HPLC analysis (Fig. 5) 4 . Pulse-chase analysis of the processing of ERp99. ERp99 was metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]methionine during a 15-min incubation of MOPC-315 plasmacytoma cells with the radioactive amino acid. To begin the chase, cells were diluted 20-fold in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 1 mM methionine. At the indicated times, samples were removed and the cells collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed once and resuspended in lysing buffer at 5 x 10 6 cells/ml. The ERp99 was isolated by immunoprecipitation from the detergent-soluble cell ly sates, incubated in the absence (-) and presence (+) of endo H and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel.

Smaller amounts of oligosaccharides coeluting with larger and smaller size standards were also detected. The extent of processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides has been used to follow the intracellular transport of glycoproteins (for review, see Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) . The conversion of the oligosaccharide from an endo Hsensitive structure to an endo H-resistant structure has been used to indicate that the protein has been transported from the site of oligosaccharide addition in the RER to the site of the GlcNAc transferase I and GlcNAc-dependent \u03b1-mannosidase activities in the Golgi. The ERp99 carbohydrate moiety was never converted to an endo H-resistant structure.

The detergent-soluble cell lysate was preabsorbed extensively with rabbit anti-H M315 before treatment with anti-ERp99. The immunoprecipitated proteins were digested with pronase, and the resultant glycopeptides were treated with endo H.

We also wish to test the hypothesis that ER membrane proteins possess structural features that may act as signals to direct their localization to the ER. A first step in the realization of these goals is the determination of the primary sequence of ERp99. The most rapid way of determining the amino acid sequence of a protein is to obtain and sequence a full-length cDNA clone encoding the protein. From calculations we had made from the results of our cell-free translation experiments, we reasoned that sucrose gradient fractionation would be sufficient to enrich our mRNA preparations to the point where ERp99 mRNA was approximately 0.5% of the mRNA. A cDNA library prepared from this mRNA fraction could be screened by hybridization -ERp99 *ERp99-CHO selection procedures which, although laborious, promised a reasonable chance of identifying an ERp cDNA clone.",

In a screen of 800 independent transformants, 7 (0.9%) ERp99 clones were found. The first ERp99 cDNA clone that was analyzed (1-14 in Fig. 8) contained an insert of 500 bp. We used this insert to screen the members of the other transformant pools which were positive for ERp99 cDNA clones (pools A, D, N, and O in Fig. 2 and pools from another screening experiment). Three larger cDNA clones were identified containing overlapping cDNAs of 2100, 2500, and 2600 bp. Measurement of the size of murine ERp99 mRNA by Northern blot analysis indicated that ERp99 mRNA is approximately 3200 nucleotides in length (Fig. 9 ). An mRNA of the same length was also detected in human (HeLa) cells. This observation is consistent with our earlier results demonstrating a striking degree of immunological relatedness between the ERp99 identified in different cells and tissues (1985a).

In mock-transfected cells (lanes 1,2), in untransfected cells (lanes 7,8), or in cells transfected with pcD99-l (lanes 3,4), the only ERp99-related band observed was a small amount of cross-reacting monkey ERp99. This was an expected finding based upon our earlier observations concerning the antigenic relatedness of ERp99 from cells of various animal species. The monkey ERp99 contained an endo H sensitive oligosaccharide moiety and was slightly larger than murine ERp99. Transfection with pcD99-2 resulted in the synthesis of a significant amount of murine ERp99 which, like the ERp99 made in plasmacytoma cells, was completely endo H sensitive (lanes 5,6). In addition to normally sized ERp99, a species migrating more slowly was detected when the immunoprecipitates from pcD99-2 transfected cells were not treated with endo H (lane 5). Upon treatment with endo H (lane 6), this band migrated at the ERp99 (-CHO) position. These results indicate that the altered migration of this ERp99-related species is a function of its Nlinked oligosaccharide residue(s).",

A comparison of the sequences of ERp99 and hsp90 is shown in Fig. 14 Fig. 13 . Hydropathy plot of the predicted amino acid sequence of murine ERp99. The hydropathy plot was obtained using the algorithm and hydropathy values of Kyte and Doolittle (1982) for an amino acid segment length of 21. Hydrophobic regions are above the line and drophilic regions are below. The position of the putative membrane-spanning region is indicated by the dark box. Taken from Mazzarella and Green (1987 Mazzarella and Green (1987) . first 14 amino acids of mature ERp99 are identical to the N-terminal sequence reported for GRP94 (Lee et al., 1984) and that the C-terminal half of ERp99 is 96% identical to the sequence derived from a cDNA clone encoding the C-terminal half of GRP94 (Lee et al., 1983; Munro and Pelham, 1986) . Other similarities which strengthen this finding are that, like ERp99, GRP94 is a dimeric glycoprotein (Lee et al., 1984) and is encoded by an abundant mRNA of approximately 3000 nucleotides (Lee et al., 1983) . Furthermore, a comparison of the ERp99 cDNA sequence with the cDNA sequence determined for \"hspl08\" by Kulomaa (1986) indicates that these proteins are 91% identical. An alignment of these sequences is given in Fig. 15 . Thus, the relationship between the ER protein ERp99, and hsp90, hsp83, and GRP94 is analogous to that reported for the rat liver hsp70-related protein, p72 and D. melanogaster hsp70, GRP78 and heavy chain binding protein (BiP) (Munro and Pelham, 1986) .",

The studies that have been reported so far help to focus our attention on protein domains which could contain sorting signals dictating ER localization. The results described by Kabcenell and Atkinson (1985) in their investigation of the sorting of the rotavirus VP7 protein emphasized the role of an amino-terminal transmembrane domain as a positive signal for ER localization. In addition, the observations that the incorporation of a charged amino acid in the middle of the transmembrane region (Adams and Rose, 1985a) , or the deletion of a substantial part of the transmembrane region (Adams and Rose, 1985b) blocked transport of VSV G protein to the cell surface, but not membrane insertion, are consistent with the view that the transmembrane domains of membrane proteins can contain important information for protein sorting as the proteins traverse the transport pathway. On the other hand, the observation that many ER proteins have a significant portion of their protein chain exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane has been interpreted to support the possibility that the cytoplasmic domain of ER proteins may contain positive or negative sorting signals which result in ER localization of the particular protein (Kreibich et al., 1983b; Paabo et al., 1987) . Recent observations by Munro and Pelham (1987) and Medda et al. (1987) implicate the importance of luminal domains resulting in the ER localization of ER proteins.

A comparison of the amino acid sequences of ERp99 from mouse (Mazzarella and Green, 1987) , chicken (Kulomaa et aL, 1986) , and hamster (Sorger and Pelham, 1987) is shown. Identity to murine ERp99 is indicated by a dot. In cases where the sequences differ, the particular amino acid found at that position is listed. A dash is used to indicate where gaps were introduced to produce optimal alignment. A comparison of mouse ERp99 and chicken ERp99 reveals that they have 91% homology; mouse ERp99 and hamster ERp99 have 96% identity. sorting studies, a description of which signal or mixture of signals is operating to localize a particular protein to the ER membrane should emerge. Our studies of ERp99 should provide significant contributions to our understanding of the ER protein sorting problem.",

This model is based on data from our earlier work (Lewis et ai, 1985b) as well as from the results described in this paper. ERp99 is synthesized as a precursor with a cleavable signal peptide (Figure 7) . We have placed the N-terminus within the lumen to account for this fact. ERp99 is a glycoprotein with, in all likelihood, only one N-linked oligosaccharide. Analysis of the sequence indicates that ERp99 has six potential sites for N-linked glycoslation. Our model places only two of these sites in the lumen where they have the potential to be acceptors for the core oligosaccharide. The presence of two sites in the lumen, one utilized and the other cryptic, could explain our observations concerning ERp99 expression in COS cells. An overabundance of ERp99 in the ER membrane may allow detection of an abnormal N-glycosylation reaction at the second site. Analysis of the hydrophobicity of the ERp99 sequence indicates that the best candidate for a transmembrane region is the 21-23 residue hydrophobic segment beginning at position 170. Our model uses this segment as the membrane-spanning, stop transfer region allowing ERp99 to pass through the membrane only once with 75% of the protein remaining on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Analysis of the hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment of this segment using the algorithm of Eisenberg et al. (1984) indicated that the values for this region are characteristic of transmembrane regions of multimeric proteins LUMEN CYTOPLASM Fig. 16 . Model for the membrane orientation of murine ERp99.

In this regard, it is interesting to note that when ERp99 is analyzed under nonreducing conditions, approximately 50% of the protein is found in a homodimer (R. Mazzarella, unpublished observation) . The proposed orientation places all the hydrophilic regions of ERp99 on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This is similar to the model proposed for the orientation of the signal recognition particle (SRP) receptor (Lauffer et al., 1985) . It is also consistent with our earlier observation that ERp99 is completely susceptible to proteases in intact membrane preparations (Lewis et al., 1985b) . Under the conditions used in these experiments, known luminal proteins were protected from degradation. The newly synthesized IgA produced by the MOPC-315 plasmacytoma cell used in these studies was resistant to papain digestion, and another ERp, ERp59, which we have recently shown by immunological criteria (R. B. Freedman, personal communication) and DNA sequence analysis (R. Mazzarella and M. Green, unpublished results) to be the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase, a known luminal enzyme, was resistant to both papain and trypsin digestion (Lewis et al., 1986 ). From our model, a peptide of approximately 20,000 Da would be expected to survive protease treatment. We have not observed such a fragment. It is possible that the anti-ERp99 polyclonal antibody used to analyze the protease protection experiments cannot recognize, or binds only weakly to, this fragment of ERp99. It should be possible to test our model. Using the deduced amino acid sequence, we can prepare antipeptide antibodies against different regions of ERp99. These antibodies can be assayed for their ability to react with ERp99 in intact microsomes. Antibodies against putative luminal regions should bind to the protein only after the disruption of microsomes or the solubilization of the protein. This approach was used successfully to analyze the orientation of HMG-CoA reductase, another ER protein (Liscum et al., 1985) .",

In addition, ERp99 is identical to GRP94. This observation is analogous to the finding by Munro and Pelham (1986) that the heat shock-related protein designated p72 is homologous to hsp70 from D. melanogaster, GRP78 and the ER protein BiP, the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein. It is interesting to note that, similar to the relationship of p72 and hsp70, the overlap of ERp99 with hsp90 is not observed until approximately 70 amino acids into the ERp99 sequence. This extra N-terminal sequence contains the signal peptide which is responsible for mediating the initial sorting of ERp99 to the ER membrane in addition to one of the proposed N-glycosylation sites. The other potential site (ERp99 position 86) is conserved between ERp99 and hsp90. In contrast to the overlap between p72 and hsp70, however, ERp99 also has extra amino acids at its C-terminal end. Our model of ERp99 places most of the protein on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, unlike p72 which is in the lumen of the ER. Thus, our hypothesis differs from that of Pelham who has indicated that GRP94 may be a luminal ER protein by virtue of the fact that it, like GRP78 and protein disulfide isomerase (Pelham, 1986) , possesses the common C-terminal sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu-COOH (KDEL) (Edman et aL, 1985) . It does not necessarily follow, however, that because ERp99 possess this sequence, it is a luminal protein. Indeed, if this sequence fulfills the same function for ERp99 that it does for GRP78, it would only be necessary that this part of the protein be in the lumen of the ER. In this case, our model (Fig. 16 ) would have to be modified by postulating that the ERp99 protein chain passes through the membrane twice, once at the indicated region and again near the C terminus. Analysis of the protein sequence, using the algorithm of Eisenberg et aL (1984) , indicates that there is another potential membrane-spanning region, albeit a relatively poor one, from residues 687 to 707 that could serve this function. It is our aim to test our working model directly by using methods designed to produce specific truncations, internal deletions, and point mutations within the ERp99 coding sequence and to investigate the effect of these alterations on the sorting and membrane orientation of the mutated proteins expressed from these clones.",

            "text": "In addition to using ERp99 as a model system to study ER protein sorting, it is interesting to determine the function of ERp99 in the ER membrane. No enzymatic activity has been assigned to hsp90, GRP94, or related proteins. Hsp90, however, is abundant in many cells and has been reported to have several activities. Hsp90 forms a complex with pp60 src and a 50,000 Da phosphoprotein in cultured avian cells (Opperman et aL, 1981; Brugge et aL, 1981; Adkins et aL, 1982) . Other viral transforming proteins containing tyrosine specific kinase activity, ppl40^5 and \u03c1\u03c194^5, have also been shown to be transiently associated with hsp90 (Lipsich et aL, 1982) . Recently, hsp90 has been shown to bind to the steroid hormone receptor (Sanchez et aL, 1985; Schuh et aL, 1985; Catelli et aL, 1985) and to actin (Catelli et aL, 1985) . It has been postulated that all of these findings point to the involvement of hsp90 as a carrier for the transportation of important biological molecules within the cell (Koyasu, 1986) . In contrast to our finding that ERp99 is localized to the ER, other laboratories have reported that the larger glucose regulated protein is localized to the Golgi (Lin and Quelly, 1982; Welch et aL, 1983) or to the plasma membrane (Pouyssegur and Yamado, 1978; McCormick et aL, 1982) . Given the fact that these proteins are identified merely by their molecular weight on SDS-PAGE and, in some cases, their isoelectric point and that there is a paucity of sequence information available about them, it is possible that these other, larger glucose-regulated proteins are not identical to ERp99. When more sequence data are obtained, it should be possible to reconcile these findings.",

Future work will focus on trying to understand if and how the ER localization of ERp99 is involved in its function. It is possible, for example, that ERp99 has a function analogous to the one proposed for p72 (BiP) but performs this function on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. It is also possible, however, that although there is extensive sequence homology among the hsp90 family, they fulfill different functions within the cell. Given the relatively strict localization of ERp99 to the RER and its transmembrane orientation in the ER membrane, we are currently investigating the possibility that ERp99 has a role in the translocation of nascent proteins through the ER membrane. Approaches being used include the expression of cloned ERp99 and derivatives in yeast to determine if ERp99 can restore viability to mutants in which the HSP90 genes have been inactivated. In addition, the use of antisense RNA strategies (Izant and Weintraub, 1984; Kim and Wold, 1985) could provide insights into the role of ERp99 in cells under normal and \"stressful\" growth conditions. Our study of ERp99 should provide valuable information concerning the mechanism of protein transport and sorting, as well as the possible functions of heat shock and \"stress\" proteins.",

This map will be useful in several ways. By determining which alterations in the ERp99 sequence produce the positive effect of movement out of the ER compartment, we hope to gain insight into the manner in which ERp99 is initially localized in the ER membrane. In addition, depending upon how far along the normal transport pathway the altered ERp99 molecules travel, we may also gain insights into features of the protein that are necessary for the complete transport of the protein to the plasma membrane or into the medium as a secreted protein. Furthermore, if specific features of the ERp99 molecule (i.e., the transmembrane regions or the cytoplasmic domain) can be shown to be responsible for its ER localization, it should be possible to confirm this observation by constructing suitable chimeric molecules between ERp99 and either secretory protein sequences, or plasma membrane protein sequences. These types of experiments have the drawback that the construction of these chimeras result in \"new\" proteins that may not behave in simple, predictable ways. They should prove useful, however, to confirm the results of mutagenesis studies and to determine if any ERp99 domains contain ER localization information when excised from the molecule and fused to foreign proteins.",

It would be worthwhile, for example, to determine if there are specific proteins which interact with ERp99 to either keep it in the ER normally or allow it to be transported out of the ER, if it is altered in a suitable way. In addition, it may be possible to select mutants of eukaryotic cells with altered components of the transport pathway by using the recombinant DNA constructions to create a situation in which such mutants can be selected. For example, if it was observed that a VSV-G-ERp99 chimera was sorted to the ER, it should be possible to construct a stable expression vector containing this chimera, transform a suitable host cell with it, and select a mutant cell in which this chimera was transported to the surface and could be detected by the expression of the VSV domain on the plasma membrane. This type of study should help us to begin to elucidate the cellular machinery involved in protein transport. Finally, it should be possible to accomplish the expression of ERp99 in yeast in order to take advantage of both the availability of secretion mutants in that system (for review, see Schekman, 1985) and the possibility of producing large amounts of altered ERp99 molecules for chemical and physical studies which could complement our studies of the effects of protein sequence alterations on ERp99 sorting.
