In Archaea recoding has been unequivocally determined so far only for termination codon readthrough events. We study here the mechanism of expression of a gene encoding for a a-L-fucosidase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (fucA1), which is split in two open reading frames separated by a \u00c01 frameshifting. The expression in Escherichia coli of the wild-type split gene led to the production by frameshifting of full-length polypeptides with an efficiency of 5%. Mutations in the regulatory site where the shift takes place demonstrate that the expression in vivo occurs in a programmed way. Further, we identify a full-length product of fucA1 in S.solfataricus extracts, which translate this gene in vitro by following programmed \u00c01 frameshifting. This is the first experimental demonstration that this kind of recoding is present in Archaea.",

However, the genetic code is not quite universal: in certain organelles and in a small number of organisms the meaning of different codons has been reassigned and all the mRNAs are decoded accordingly. More surprisingly, the standard rules of genetic decoding are altered in specific genes by different events that are globally termed recoding (1) . In all cases, translational recoding occurs in competition with normal decoding, with a proportion of the ribosomes not obeying to the 'universal' rules. Translational recoding has been identified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It has crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression and includes stop codon readthrough, ribosome hopping and \u00b11 programmed frameshifting [for reviews see (2) (3) (4) ].",

Specific stimulatory elements downstream to the stop codon regulate this process (5) . Hopping, in which the ribosome stops translation in a particular site of the mRNA and re-start few nucleotides downstream, is a rare event and it has been studied in detail only in the bacteriophage T4 (6) . In programmed frameshifting, ribosomes are induced to shift to an alternative, overlapping reading frame 1 nt 3 0 -wards (+1 frameshifting) or 5 0 -wards (\u00c01 frameshifting) of the mRNA. This process is regulated and its frequency varies in different genes. The \u00b11 programmed frameshifting has been studied extensively in viruses, retrotransposons and insertion elements for which many cases are documented (7) (8) (9) . Instead, this phenomenon is by far less common in cellular genes. A single case of programmed +1 frameshifting is known in prokaryotes (10, 11) while in eukaryotes, including humans, several genes regulated by this recoding event have been described previously [(4) and references therein]. Compared to +1 frameshifting, \u00c01 frameshifting is less widespread with only two examples in prokaryotes (12) (13) (14) and few others in eukaryotes (15) (16) (17) .",

This gene, named fucA1, is organized in the open reading frames (ORFs) SSO11867 and SSO3060 of 81 and 426 amino acids, respectively, which are separated by a \u00c01 frameshifting in a 40 base overlap ( Figure 1A ). We have reported previously that the region of overlap between the two ORFs had the characteristic features of the genes expressed by programmed \u00c01 frameshifting including a slippery heptanucleotide A-AAA-AAT (codons are shown in the zero frame) flanked by a putative stem-loop and the rare codons CAC ( Figure 1A ) resembling the prokaryotic stem-loops/hairpins and the Shine-Dalgarnolike sites (24) . We showed that the frameshifting, obtained by mutating by site-directed mutagenesis the fucA1 gene exactly in the position predicted from the slippery site, produced a full-length gene, named fucA1 A , encoding for a polypeptide of 495 amino acids ( Figure 1B ). This mutant gene expressed in Escherichia coli a fully functional a-L-fucosidase, named Ssa-fuc, which was thermophilic, thermostable and had an unusual nonameric structure (24, 25) . More recently, we determined the reaction mechanism and the function of the residues of the active site of the mutant enzyme (26, 27) .",

The enzyme was then purified by using the GST purification system and analysed by SDS-PAGE revealing a major protein band ( Figure 2A ). The sample and control bands were excised from the gel, digested in situ with trypsin and directly analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry (MALDIMS). As shown in Figure 2B and C, both spectra revealed the occurrence of an identical mass signal at m/z 1244.6 corresponding to a peptide (Peptide A) encompassing the overlapping region of the two ORFs. This result was confirmed by liquid chromatography online tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS) analysis of the peptide mixtures. The fragmentation spectra of the two signals showed the common sequence Asn-Phe-Gly-Pro-Val-Thr-Asp-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Lys in which the amino acid from the ORF SSO11867 is underlined. These results unequivocally demonstrate that the protein containing the Peptide A is produced in E.coli by a frameshifting event that occurred exactly within the slippery heptamer predicted from the analysis of the DNA sequence in the region of overlap between the ORFs SSO11867 and SSO3060 ( Figure 1A) .",

To test this hypothesis, we mutated the sequence A-AAA-AAT into A-AAG-AAT and C-AAG-AAC (mutations are underlined) obtaining the fucA1 single mutant ( fucA1 sm ) and triple mutant ( fucA1 tm ) genes, respectively. It is worth noting that the mutations disrupt the slippery sequence, but they maintain the \u00c01 frameshift between the two ORFs (Table 1) . Surprisingly, the expression of fucA1 sm in E.coli produced a full-length polypeptide that, after purification by affinity chromatography and removal of the GST protein, showed the same electrophoretic migration of Ssa-fuc and Ssa-fuc B ( Figure 4A ). This protein was then characterized by mass spectrometry analyses following in situ tryptic digestion. Interestingly, the MALDI spectra revealed the presence of a single peptide encompassing the overlapping region between the two ORFs with a mass value of 1259.7 Da (peptide C; Figure 4B ). The sequence of peptide C, determined from the fragmentation spectra obtained by LCMSMS analysis, was Glu-Phe-Gly-Pro-Val-Thr-Asp-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Lys ( Figure 4C ). Remarkably, apart from the Glu residue, this sequence is identical to that of peptide B produced from fucA1, indicating that in the mutant gene fucA1 sm only one of the two frameshifting events observed in the wild-type fucA1 gene had occurred. The presence of a Glu instead of Lys was not unexpected. The mutation A-AAA-AAT!A-AAG-AAT in fucA1 sm was conservative in the zero frame of the ORF SSO11867 (AAA!AAG, both encoding Lys), but it produced the mutation AAA!GAA (Lys!Glu) in the \u00c01 frame of the ORF SSO3060.",

Accurate assays showed that S.solfataricus extracts contained 3.4 \u00b7 10 \u00c04 units mg \u00c01 of a-fucosidase activity. These very low amounts hampered the purification of the enzyme. The extracts of S.solfataricus cells grown on YSM revealed by western blot a band of a molecular mass >97 kDa and no signals were detected with the pre-immune serum confirming the specificity of the anti-Ssa-fuc antibodies ( Figure 5A) . The different molecular mass may result from post-translational modifications occurred in the archaeon or from the incomplete denaturation of a protein complex. In particular, the latter event is not unusual among enzymes from hyperthermophilic archaea (31, 32) . To test which hypotheses were appropriate, cellular extracts of S.solfataricus were analysed by western blot extending the incubation at 100 C to 2 h. Interestingly, this treatment shifted the high-molecular mass band to 67.6 \u00b1 1.2 kDa ( Figure 5B and C) , which still differs from that of the recombinant Ssa-fuc, 58.9 \u00b1 1.2 kDa, leaving the question on the origin of this difference unsolved. To try to shed some light we immunoprecipitated extracts of S.solfataricus with anti-Ssa-fuc antibodies and we analysed the major protein band by MALDIMS. Unfortunately, we could not observe any peptide compatible with the fucosidase because the heavy IgG chain co-migrated with the band of the expected molecular weight (data not shown).",

(28) . To this aim, a promoter of T7 polymerase was inserted ahead of the gene of interest to obtain RNA transcripts endowed with the short 5 0untranslated region of 9 nt observed for the natural fucA1 mRNA (24) . Autoradiography of an SDS-PAGE of the translation products (Figure 7 ) revealed that the wild-type fucA1 transcript produced a tiny but clear band whose molecular weight corresponded to that of the full-length Ssa-fuc obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (24); the latter was translated quite efficiently in the cell-free system in spite of being encoded by a quasi-leaderless mRNA. Judging from the relative intensity of the signals given by the translation products of the wild-type fucA1 and the full-length mutant fucA1 A , the efficiency of the \u00c01 frameshifting in the homologous system was $10%. No signals corresponding to the polypeptides expected from the separated ORFs SSO11867 and SSO3060 (9.6 and 46.5 kDa, respectively) were observed. However, it should be noted that the product of SSO11867, even if synthesized, is too small to be detected in the gel system employed for this experiment. The larger product of ORF SSO3060, on the other hand, is certainly absent. These data unequivocally demonstrate that the ribosomes of S.solfataricus can decode the split fucA1 gene by programmed \u00c01 frameshifting with considerable efficiency producing a full-length polypeptide from the two ORFs SSO11867 and SSO3060.",

            "text": "MALDIMS and LCMSMS analyses of the products in E.coli of the wild-type split gene fucA1 demonstrated that two independent frameshifting events occurred in vivo in the proposed slippery site. In particular, the sequences obtained by LCMSMS demonstrate that peptide A results from a simultaneous backward slippage of both the P-and the A-site tRNAs ( Figure 8A) . Instead, the sequence of peptide B is the result of the re-positioning on the \u00c01 frame of only the P-site tRNA; in fact, the next incorporated amino acid is specified by the codon in the new frame ( Figure 8B) . Therefore, the expression by \u00c01 frameshifting of the wild-type gene fucA1 in E.coli follows the models proposed for ribosomal frameshifting (34) . We confirmed the significance of the slippery heptanucleotide in promoting the programmed frameshifting in vivo by mutating the putative regulatory sequence. The triple mutant fucA1 tm gave no full-length products; presumably, the mutations in both the P-and in the A-site of the slippery sequence dramatically reduced the efficiency of the \u00c01 frameshifting as observed previously in metazoans (35) . This result confirms that the intact slippery sequence in the wild-type gene fucA1 is absolutely necessary for its expression in E.coli. In contrast, surprisingly, the single mutant fucA1 sm showed an even increased frequency of frameshifting (10%) if compared to the wild-type and produced only one polypeptide by shifting specifically in site B. We explained this result observing that the mutation in the P-site of the slippery sequence A-AAA-AAT!A-AAG-AAT created a novel slippery sequence A-AAG identical to that controlling the expression by programmed \u00c01 frameshifting of a transposase gene in E.coli (36) . Therefore, apparently, the single mutation inactivated the simultaneous P-and A-site tRNA re-positioning and, in the same time, fostered the shifting efficiency of the tRNA in the P-site. It is worth noting that, instead, in S.solfataricus, only the simultaneous slippage is effective ( Figure 8B ) and even the single mutation in the slippery sequence of fucA1 sm completely annulled the expression of the gene. This indicates that this sequence is essential in the archaeon and that programmed frameshifting in S.solfataricus and E.coli exploits different mechanisms. Furthermore, since the only difference between the enzymes produced by the frameshifting sites A and B, Ssa-fuc and Ssa-fuc B , respectively, is the stability at 80 C, which is the S.solfataricus physiological temperature, the functionality of Ssa-fuc B in the archaeon appears questionable.",

However, the physiological significance of programmed frameshifting has been assigned to a minority of the cellular genes while for most of them it is still uncertain [see (4) and reference therein; (16) ]. This mechanism of recoding is exploited to set the ratio of two polypeptides such as the t and g subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in E.coli (12) . Alternatively, programmed frameshifting balances the expression of a protein, as the bacterial translational release factor 2 and the eukaryotic ornithine decarboxylase antizyme [see (4) and (18) and references therein]. In the case of fucA1, the polypeptide encoded by the smaller ORF SSO11867 could never be detected by western blots analyses. In addition, the modelling of Ssa-fuc on the high-resolution crystal structure of the a-L-fucosidase from Thermotoga maritima (25, 37) showed that the fucA1 N-terminal polypeptide is not an independent domain. Moreover, we have shown recently that SSO11867 includes essential catalytic residues (27) , excluding the possibility that a functional a-fucosidase can be obtained from the ORF SSO3060 alone. Therefore, several lines of evidence allow us to exclude that programmed \u00c01 frameshifting is used to set the ratio of two polypeptides of the a-fucosidase from S.solfataricus. More probably, this translational mechanism might be required to control the expression level of fucA1.",

Among carbohydrate active enzymes, the only example of expression through this recoding mechanism is that reported for a gene encoding for a a(1,2)-fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori that is interrupted by a \u00c01 frameshifting (38) . In this case, the expression by programmed frameshifting would lead to a functional enzyme synthesizing components of the surface lipopolysaccharides to evade the human immune defensive system. It is hard to parallel this model to fucA1. Nevertheless, the monosaccharide fucose is involved in a variety of biological functions (39) . Therefore, the a-L-fucosidase might play a role in the metabolism of fucosylated oligosaccharides; experiments are currently in progress to knockout the wild-type fucA1 gene and to insert constitutive functional mutants of this gene in S.solfataricus.",

However, since there are no a-fucosidases genes regulated by programmed frameshifting in Bacteria and Eukarya, it is tempting to speculate that this sophisticated mechanism of translational regulation preexisted in S.solfataricus and it was applied to the fucosidase gene for physiological reasons. The identification of other genes interrupted by \u00c01 frameshifts in S.solfataricus would open the possibility that they are regulated by programmed \u00c01 frameshifting. Recently, the computational analysis of prokaryotic genomes revealed that seven Archaea harbour interrupted coding sequences, but S.solfataricus is not included in this study (40) . A computational analysis on several archaeal genomes revealed that 34 interrupted genes are present in the genome of S.solfataricus, 11 of these genes are composed by two ORFs separated by \u00c01 frameshifting and could be expressed by recoding (B. Cobucci-Ponzano, M. Rossi and M. Moracci, manuscript in preparation).",
