A variety of foods have served as vehicles for bacterial pathogens (Table I) . Bryan (1988) analysed 1586 cases of foodborne illness reported from 1977 to 1984 in the United States. The most frequently identified vehicles were seafoods (24.8%), meats (23.2%), poultry (9.8%), salads (8.8%), and others ( 4 % ) . Other foods implicated included: raw clams, fried rice, and Mexican-style foods. Salmonella has been the most common aetiological agent identified in foodborne cases, followed by Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus (Beckers, 1988; Todd, 1988) .

The presence of these viruses in environmental waters indicates that current disinfection treatments are not thoroughly effective for viruses. Enteric viruses have been found to be more resistant to chlorine treatment and to survive longer in the environment than bacteria, and these properties are accentuated in the presence of particulate material (Berg et af., 1978) . It is not surprising that enteric viruses have been found in waters which lack bacterial indicators and are considered microbiological1)r safe (Craun, 1978; Rose et al., 1987) . Recently, indicators more closely related to enteric viruses in structure, morphology, chemical composition, and size, like coliphage, F-male phages and Bacteriodes fragilis bacteriophages, have been used as indicators of enteric viruses.

Poliovirus has been implicated in outbreaks involving milk (Dingman, 1916; Aycock, 1927; Lipari, 1951) and has been isolated from raw ground beef (Sullivan et al., 1970) . Echovirus 4 found in coleslaw was the aetiological agent involved in an outbreak of meningitis (US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1976) . While, hepatitis A has been transmitted to food through food handlers (Cliver, 1971) , other enteric viruses have been isolated from raw ground beef (Sullivan et al., 1970) , and fruits and vegetables irrigated with sewage (Bagdasar'yan, 1964; Larkin et al., 1976; Katzenelson and Mills, 1984) . Shellfish are perhaps the most important food vehicle for viruses because as filter feeders they concentrate viruses from surrounding waters and are frequently consumed raw or undercooked. A number of outbreaks of hepatitis A (Mason and McLean, 1961; Stille et al., 1972; O'Mahony et al., 1983; Gerba et al., 1985; Richards, 1985) and Norwalk virus (Murphy et al., 1979; Gunn et al., 1982; Guzewich and Morse, 1986) have been traced to the consumption of raw shellfish. Recently, Snow Mountain agent, astrovirus and calicivirus have been incriminated in shellfish-associated gastroenteritis (Dolin et al., 1987; Kurtz and Lee, 1987) . Enteroviruses and hepatitis non-A, non-B viruses have been isolated from shellfish Goyal et al., 1979; Ellender et al., 1980; Caredda et al., 1981; Alter et al., 1982) , but have not been incriminated in any outbreaks.",

Conceptually, indicators are found in samples at higher numbers and are more easily identified than pathogens. Standard indicators include coliforms, faecal coliforms, E. coli, and faecal streptococci. The following have been proposed as indicators: Bacteriodes fragilis (Fiksdal et al. , 1985) , Clostridium perfringens (Bonde, 1966) , Bifidobacterium sp. (Evison and James, 1975) , and Rhodococcus coprophilus (Mara and Oragui, 1981) . Because bacterial indicators fail to correlate with the presence of viral pathogens, coliphages (Guelin, 1948) , Fmale phages (Havelaar et al., 1985) , and phages against B. fragilis (Jofre et al., 1986; Tartera and Jofre, 1987) , which have survival properties similar to those of viral pathogens, have been proposed as indicators of viral contamination. The use, shortcomings, advantages, and detection methods for indicator organisms have been reviewed extensively (Hoadley and Dutka, 1977; Mossel, 1978 Mossel, , 1982 Matches and Abeyta, 1983; Reinhold, 1983; Splittstoesser, 1983; Tompkin, 1983; Hartman et al., 1986) .",

Prior to hybridization, the filters are incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C in hybridization solution which consists of: 50% formamide, 5X SSC (1 XSSC = 0.15M sodium chloride and 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 1 mM EDTA, and Denhardt's solution [0.02% Ficoll (molecular weight 400 OOO), 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (molecular weight 360 OOO), and 0.02% bovine serum albumin]. 6. The filters are then transferred to fresh hybridization solution containing approximately lo5 cpm of heat-denatured probe DNA ml-' and 75 pg of heat-denatured calf thymus DNA ml-' and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. 7. The filters are then washed in 5X SSC with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate for 45 min at 65\"C, rinsed briefly with 2X SSC at room temperature, and air dried. 8. The membrane is then attached to a piece of Whatman 3MM paper, covered with plastic wrap, placed on X-ray film with a single intensification screen, and held at -70\u00b0C for 24 h. 9. The X-ray film is then developed as specified by the manufacturer.",

Like radioactive labelling, nick translation is used to incorporate biotinylated analogues of nucleotides, rather than 32Plabelled nucleotides, into the DNA probe. Avidin, which has a strong affinity for biotin, is usually tagged with an enzyme (Leary et al., 1983; , Yokota et al., 1986 Bialkowska-Hobrzanska, 1987) and used to detect hybridized, biotinylated probe. Enzyme-labelled antibodies to biotin, in place of avidin, have also been used (Langer-Safer et al., 1982) . Hybridized probe is detected following the addition of enzyme substrate which when cleaved results in the production of a visible end product. Biotin-labelled probes have been used in the detection of enterotoxigenic E. coli (Bialkowska-Hobrzanska, 1987) , Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli (Sethabutr et al., 1985) , and hepatitis B virus (Yokota et al., 1986) .

(1988) have developed a gene amplification method (the polymerase chain reaction) whereby specific DNA sequences are selectively amplified by a factor of 105-106. The procedure involves two primers which hybridize to opposite strands of DNA on each end of target DNA. The primers are oriented in opposite directions so DNA synthesis proceeds across the target DNA and between the two primers. Because the primers also bind to each of the newly synthesized strands, repeated cycles of heat denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis doubles the amount of target from the previous cycle. The technique has been improved by replacing the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I with heat stable Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq), which eliminates the need to add fresh DNA polymerase after each denaturation, and by automation with a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus Corporation, Norwalk, CT). Steffan and Atlas (1988) used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify a specific region of DNA from Pseudomonas cepacia which was then identified by dot-blot hybridization. Initial quantities of 0.3pg of target DNA could be detected following amplification, an increase in sensitivity of lo3 over non-amplified samples. Following extraction of DNA from sediment, lo2 P. cepacia cells 100 per g of sediment (or 1 cell g-') could be detected despite the presence of 10\" other organisms.",

Extraction from aquatic environments requires that large sample volumes be taken to accrue enough DNA for testing. Somerville et al. (1988b) described an inexpensive method for concentrating microorganisms from litres of water on a single cylindrical filter membrane. Cell lysis and proteolysis were executed in the filter housing yielding high molecular weight DNA/RNA solutions which could be tested immediately, concentrated, or purified. Hepatitis A has been detected in concentrated estuarine water samples . The RNA was extracted from the sample, purified, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a hepatitis A probe. This method, and others which bypass cultivation of the organism, save time and can be used to account for members of the population which resist cultivation (i.e. Norwalk virus). Additional information on the use of gene probes to study microbial communities can be found in a review by Ogram and Sayler (1988) .",

The use of polyclonal antisera sometimes necessitates selective media to prevent growth of cross-reacting organisms. The specificity and sensitivity of immunological assays have been enhanced with monoclonal antibodies and new combinations of enzyme labels and substrate. These advancements have facilitated the development of methods to detect microorganisms directly in samples without prior culture enrichment. As stated above, direct detection methods are important in light of recent reports that several bacterial pathogens are not culturable using standard culture methods yet are still metabolically active Roszak and Colwell, 1987) . Likewise, several groups among the enteric viruses cannot be propagated using standard tissue culture techniques, but are still of public health concern (e.g. Norwalk virus). Because it is not possible to cover all of the immunological methods used to detect pathogens, emphasis will be on the more sensitive techniques used in the detection and identification of important food-and waterborne pathogens.",

Monoclonal antibodies may provide a solution to this problem. Monoclonal antibodies specific for Vibrio cholerae 01 have been used to detect this pathogen in water by FIA. Another shortcoming of FIA is the inability to differentiate viable from non-viable cells; both appear fluorescent. Brayton and Colwell et al. (1987) described an FIA procedure for the enumeration of viable V . cholerae 01 in environmental samples. Samples were incubated with a small quantity of yeast extract to supply nutrients and nalidixic acid which prevents replication by inhibition of DNA gyrase. Metabolically active cells elongate because they are unable to divide in the presence of nalidixic acid. Viable (elongated) cells are then distinguished from non-viable (unelongated) cells, microscopically. When combined with plate counts, this method provided the means to determine the numbers of viable (culturable), dead, and viable but non-culturable cells present within a sample Brayton and Colwell, 1987) .

In non-competitive EIAs, the antigen (microbe or substance of interest) within a sample is detected using complementary enzyme-labelled antibody. The antigen concentration is directly proportional to the amount of enzyme-labelled antibody bound and end product formed. In competitive assays, the antigen to be detected within a sample is usually purified and labelled with an enzyme. The enzyme-labelled antigen is added to the sample and incubated with an immobilized antigen-specific antibody. Absence of the antigen will result in the production of end product due to the binding of the enzyme-labelled antigen to the antigen-specific antibody. The presence of antigen within the sample (unlabelled) reduces the amount of end product formed because of the competition with the enzyme-labelled antigen for antibody binding sites. Thus, in competitive EIAs, the quantity of antigen within a sample is inversely proportional to the amount of end product formed. Competitive assays are faster than non-competitive EIAs, but require purification and labelling of the antigen of interest. Although noncompetitive EIAs are slower, requiring several incubation and washing steps to avoid non-specific binding and background, it is more commonly used for the detection of microbial antigens.",

Another impediment to testing food and water for pathogens using EIA is the requirement for a minimum of 104-105 organisms m1-I. Rarely do pathogens reach this number in food and water. In most cases, the organism to be detected must first be grown in enrichment culture, to increase numbers, and then identified using EIA. Membrane filtration coupled with EIA has been used to detect a number of enterotoxigenic bacteria (Table VI) . Following filtration of the sample onto a nitrocellulose filter and incubation, the bacterial colonies formed on the surface of the filter are screened by EIA for a particular pathogen or toxin. Using an assay similar to the immunofluorescence assay, virus-infected cells have been detected using a peroxidase-labelled antibody. If bound, peroxidase catalyses the production of a stain which enables foci to be quantitated microscopically.",

            "text": "Radioimmunoassay (RIA), described by Yalow and Berson (1959) , can be used in all of the variations of EIA described above. RIA combines the specificity of immunoassays with the sensitivity of radioisotopic methods, detecting nanogram to picogram quantities of antigen (Yung er al., 1977; Kalmakoff et al., 1977) . Although 3H, I4C and 13' 1 have been utilized as labels, \"' I is more commonly used because of its high specific activity and short half-life. Several methods are available to prepare I2'I-RIA reagents (Miles and Hales, 1968; Hunter, 1978; Marchalonis, 1969) . Several variations of radioimmunoassay have been used to test food and water samples (Robern et al., 1975 Miller et al., 1978) . The method outlined below was described by Pierce and Klinman (1976) . Procedure 1. Following inoculation and incubation, cells from enrichment broth (for the organism of interest) are pelleted by centrifugation and washed in PBS (per litre: NaCl, 7.6 g; Na2HP04, 0.7 g; KH2P04, 0.2 g; pH 7.4). 2. To each of duplicate wells of a 96-well polyvinyl plate, 100 p1 of the cell suspension is added and incubated at 4\u00b0C (usually overnight). 3. The wells are then washed three times with RIA buffer (PBS containing 4. To minimize non-specific binding, 250 p1 of PBS containing 2% BSA is added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. 5 . Wash the wells three times with RIA buffer. 6. The organism-specific antibody is diluted appropriately in RIA buffer, and 100 p1 is added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. 7. The wells are then washed three times with RIA buffer. 8. Between 50 and 100 p1 of '251 anti-immunoglobulin (10 pCi pg-') is added to each well (10 OOO cpm well-') and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 9. Unbound 1251 anti-immunoglobulin is then removed by washing the wells three times. Enterotoxigenic bacteria have been detected within natural populations (Shah et af., 1982) by blotting colonies onto polyvinyl membranes and probing with specific radiolabelled antibody. A radioimmunofocus assay (Lemon et af., 1983) has been used to detect viruses following multiplication in suitable cell lines. Infected cells are detected and enumerated using '2sI-labelled antibodies and autoradiography. In Table VIII are listed pathogens which have been detected in food and water by RIA. Despite the high sensitivity of the assay, RIA has not been used extensively in the food industry because of the problems associated with the use and disposal of radioactive materials.",

            "text": "The ability to detect specific enzymes rapidly using chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates has led to the development of a number of rapid methods for the identification of several bacteria (Kilian and Bulow, 1976; Godsey et af., 1981; Facklam et al., 1982; Trepeta and Edberg, 1984; O'Brien and Colwell, 1985; Feng and Hartman, 1982; Littel and Hartman, 1983; Petzel and Hartman, 1985; Freier and Hartman, 1987) . Feng and Hartman (1982) tested a variety of food, water, and milk samples using lauryl tryptose broth containing 4-methylumbelliferyl-P-~-glucuronide (MUG) . After incubation for 24 h, E. coli was presumptively identified and confirmed in most-probable-number tubes using lactose fermentation (gas production) and MUG (fluorescence, detected under long-wave ultraviolet light), respectively. The lauryl tryptose broth-MUG-MPN was sensitive, produced few false-positive reactions, detected anaerogenic strains of E. coli, and yielded faecal coliforms from 90% of the tubes which were gas and fluorescence positive. The MUG test has compared favourably with standard MPN methods for E. coli (Alvarez, 1984; Robison, 1984; Koburger and Miller, 1985; Peterson et al., 1987) . The basis for the MUG test is the presence of 6-glucuronidase which cleaves MUG to release the fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferyl portion. P-Glucuronidase is found in a number of bacterial genera; however, among the Enterobacteriaceae it is restricted to E. coli (96%), a few Salmonella, and Shigella (50%) (Kilian and Biilow, 1976; LeMinor, 1979) .",

The application of these probes and methods to the detection of important food and waterborne microorganisms has increased in recent years. New gene and signal amplification techniques, as well as the use of rRNA genes, could circumvent the need to propagate these organisms prior to hybridization, saving time and allowing the detection of nonculturable organisms. Likewise, with new labels and/or enzyme substrates, immunological methods may be of even greater value in direct detection procedures in the near future.",
