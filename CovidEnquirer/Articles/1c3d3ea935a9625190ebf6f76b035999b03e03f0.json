            "text": "Influenza viruses A and B are the main pathogens responsible for the onset of epidemics because of their evolving nature. They are RNA viruses that have a high mutation rate and ability to make \"drift\" changes; however, only influenza A viruses are responsible for pandemics. Worldwide, influenza A viruses are the cause of severe infections in 3-5 million people annually, and these viral infections kills 0.25-0.5 million people annually. 44 As such, influenza outbreaks produce high morbidity and mortality rates with great economic and social impact. 44 Early findings in relation to the most recent influenza pandemic occurred in April 2009 in Mexico and soon spread to other countries. The pandemic was caused by an H1N1 variant, which came from two genetic recombination events. The first occurred in 1998, when an avian virus, an American pig virus, and virus fragments of humans had exchanged genetic materials. The following recombination with a European swine virus strain resulted in the pandemic swine origin influenza virus. 2, 30 In Mexico in recent years, this has caused at least four outbreaks with high mortality rates compared with that presenting in other countries. 6 During the winter of 2017-2018, influenza activity increased in Mexico, and 2,855 cases of influenza and 73 deaths were confirmed by March 02, 2018, of which 46 cases were A(H3N2), 11 cases A(H1N1) pdm09, 10 cases B, and the remaining six cases were not subtyped. 39 Results emanating from different studies have shown that influenza outbreaks are characterized by high severity of symptoms with increased mortality, 6, 8, 13, 25, 32 Several factors have been associated with H1N1 disease severity, such as factors due to the virus (ie, viral pathogenic mutations, resistance to antivirals), factors inherent to host susceptibility (eg, age, sex, race), including physiological immunosuppression or acquired diseases (ie, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma), factors associated with available medical services and public health facilities, and factors arising from the presence of bacterial coinfections. 1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 16, 18, 25, 32, 34, 35, 41 Seasonal and pandemic influenza often have complications arising from bacterial coinfections. Cill\u00f3niz et al 12 documented that in H1N1 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (26, 62%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 14%) . Staphylococcus aureus was rarely found, and Haemophilus influenzae was not found. 12 During the 1918 pandemic, most deaths had bacterial coinfections. Globally, more than 34% of influenza virus infections needed intensive care among hospitalized patients, from which 0.5% of all cases of influenza corresponded to healthy young individuals and at least 2.5% of total cases the elderly group and those with coinfections harbored the bacteria. 27 Symptoms of influenza cases with bacterial coinfections are similar to those with severe influenza, but the former may have a higher risk of death. Identification of coinfections should be considered in patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) presenting symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxia, or with evidence of septicemia. 27 Many copathogens are known to be colonizers of the respiratory mucosa, ie, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, including the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Distinction between copathogenic colonization and coinfection is critical, because a proven coinfection is clinically correlated with signs of pneumonia and bacterial contagion producing increased acuity or severity of disease. 27 Empirical antiviral treatment should be considered and managed in such critically ill patients. The most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens are those that colonize the nasopharynx, and this complex of virus-bacteria contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease, mainly in periods of endemic influenza. 26, 34 There have been studies reporting copathogens between influenza and other viruses, but few cases have observed that this produced severe complications because of coinfection. 15, 33, 42 Two studies have hypothesized a \"viral interference\", suggesting that a rhinovirus infection may interfere with the A(H1N1pdm09) influenza, but this is still not fully understood. 24, 33 The precise identification of infectious pathogens responsible for acute respiratory infections, primarily influenza, is a critical factor for proper treatment of the disease and control during outbreaks and for the appropriate use of antibiotics and antivirals. For these reasons, continuation of investigations into the pathogens commonly associated with influenza cases is urgently needed. Here, the presence of bacterial and viral copathogens are identified using clinical samples for the molecular diagnosis by resequencing microarray in study patients with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Oaxaca, Mexico. We also document an association between influenza A(H1N1pdm 09) and symptoms of disease severity in dead patients with multiple-microbial infection.",

The microarray assay has been shown to be capable of detecting in a single sample up to 30 viruses and bacteria that may produce ILI. 28 The identification of such pathogens is based on sequence analysis and subsequent search in the GenBank database, which helps to identify specific viral types and species of bacteria present in the sample. 28, 43 There was a significantly high prevalence rate of influenza patients with one and three associated pathogens ( Table 2 ). The bacteria species most frequently identified was S. pneumoniae (39.8% of total individuals with copathogens), which differs somewhat with percentages (7.5%-18.6%) reported elsewhere. 3, 8, 13, 29 H. influenzae (32.9%) and N. meningitidis (25%) also showed high prevalence rates. N. meningitidis is associated with greater severity of illness but requires a process of immunosuppression by patients. 5, 14, 23 Other associated pathogens that presented elevated prevalence rates were S. mitis (23.9%) and P. aeruginosa (14.7%), which coincide with other studies that reported (1%-13.9%) coinfections with those pathogens. 3, 29 However, when comparing the results of this study with previous studies, prudence should be exercised, given that anatomic sites sampled and techniques of detection (and sensitivity and specificity) were somewhat different.",

The results of our study are consistent with other studies that have reported lower rates of viral coinfections with respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus without significant complications or increase in the severity of the disease. 3, 15, 40 Similarly, some associations were found in most patients with certain signs and/or symptoms with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 alone and with other pathogens (Table 3) .

The 22-year-old male harbored S. pneumoniae, which appears to have a synergistic relationship with influenza. 38 This patient should have been treated on an inpatient basis and sent to the intensive care unit, as he was asthmatic and presented 10 different symptoms. However, he was treated on an outpatient basis. The 8-month-old male had eight symptoms and harbored S. mitis, which could have elevated the risk of and exacerbated the influenza infection. 21 A total of 21 of 88 H1N1 patients harbored S. mitis. All H1N1 patients who had complications and those that were submitted to intensive care units were treated with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) within 48 hours of first symptoms of infection. An increase in the number of S. mitis cases could also have hampered the efficacy of the viral neuraminidase inhibitor drug. 21 Of the four H1N1 patients who died, S. mitis was present in three.",

Given that copathogens were found commonly, this could have an impact on the disease, but more studies need to be conducted, eg, investigating if coinfections between the pandemic virus and other pathogens can be the source of secondary infections when patients are in a status of immunosuppression. Moreover, other factors explain the increase in the severity of symptoms and mortality rate caused by H1N1 in Oaxaca. It has been noted that in areas of Oaxaca, sanitary conditions are not adequate, and this may allow proliferation of the pathogenic agents detected. A monitoring and surveillance system based on molecular diagnostics for all respiratory pathogens should be implemented, as well as strengthening of sanitary measures in the local Oaxaca population, both of which are urgently needed.",
