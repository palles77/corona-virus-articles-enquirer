The home range of feral cats was also analyzed during daytime and nighttime, and all five individuals showed a wider home range during the nighttime than daytime. The analysis of gender shows that the average home range of female feral cats is larger than the average of males. Meanwhile, the results of information data with wide-open areas such as farm land and terrace land on the river showed that the analyzed value was increased generally, and showed variable values depending on the gender and size of each individual feral cat.",

            "text": "Most feral cats were pet cats that were abandoned and became wild. As more live in groups, its numbers grew rapidly. Recently, there has been a continuously growing interest in feral cats in relation to issues on wild animal protection and social health issues (Patronek, 1998; Slater, 2004) . The increase of numbers of feral cats has a negative impact on species diversity for wild animals, and in particular small mammals and birds Liberg, 1984; Mitchell and Beck, 1992; Woods et al., 2003) . Moreover, feral cats carry many zooneses (Han, 1999) . Infections of diseases caused by such feral cats are social issues and major problems that need to be addressed in terms of public health (Beaver, 1992) . In addition to the parasites and pathogens that can be spread to livestock and pet cats, they can also be transferred to humans Engback et al., 1984; Jane and Margaret, 1996) . In particular, the rapid increase of feral cats in the outskirts of cities and rural areas has a high possibility to transmit parasites and pathogens to humans (Dubey and Frenkel, 1976) . In the case of toxoplasmosis, a zoonosis that can affect a wide range of animals including birds and mammals, as well as people, cats are reported to be major mediums for infection to people . In the case of heart worms, the fact that it can be spread from feral cats to other mammals suggests a potential risk that parasites can be spread directly to other pets or people (Abbott, 1966; Bernard, 1970) . Furthermore, though it has not yet been reported in Korea, in the case of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which caused many deaths in over thirty countries focusing in Southeast Asia in 2003, civets, which are a type of feral cat, were attributed as the carrier of the pathogens. Also, in the case of avian influenza that has been continuously reported in Korea for the past several years, it has been confirmed that the virus was spread by feral cats through epidemiological investigations. Furthermore, there are claims for the possibility of secondary transfers of the virus through feral cats that came into direct or indirect contact with wild birds (Animal Plant and Fisheries Quarantine and Inspection Agency, 2011).",

However, in the case of Korea, there are almost no research on the ecology of feral cats making it impossible to clearly estimate the gravity of the problems caused by the feral cats, and it is not possible to search for suitable solutions due to lack of data (Ministry of Environment, 2001) .

The selected areas were Jukchon-ri in Hwandeung-myeon, Iksan-si of North Jeolla Province, Jangshin-ri in Yongji-myeon, Gimjae-si of North Jeolla Province, Yongheung-ri in Gobu-myeon, Jeongeubsi, North Jeolla Province, Gangjaeng-ri in Damyang-eub, Damyanggun of South Jeolla Province, and Shindae-dong in Heungdeok-gu, Cheongju-si of North Chungcheong Province. All of these regions experienced stamping out in livestock farms due to the onset of HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza). Gangjaen-ri in Damyang-eub, Damyanggun of South Jeolla Province and Shindae-dong in Heungdeokgu, Cheongju-si of North Chungcheong Province are located near the upstream of Yeongsangang (Riv.) and Geumgang (Riv.), respectively, which are both habitats for winter migratory birds. There are many people who visit the river banks and the hiking and biking trail on the terrace land of rivers, providing it higher potential for frequent contact between feral cats and wild animals or humans. Furthermore, Jukchon-ri in Hwangdeung-myeon, Iksan-si of North Jeolla Province, Jangshin-ri in Yongji-myeon, Gimjae-si of North Jeolla Province, and Yongheung-ri in Gobu-myeon, Jeongeubsi, North Jeolla Province are located near fowl farms and habitats for migratory birds, giving it high possibility for contact between feral cats and wild animals, and in particular, with wild birds. Thus, these areas have higher risks of spreading diseases by feral cats. While the capturing of feral cats were examined using their tracks in the study areas, areas frequently having movement of feral cats were selected through interviews with local residents. The capturing trap used was the Tomahawk Live Trap (25\u00d730\u00d781 cm) and chicken and ham were used as bait. After installing the traps, they were checked twice a day (once in the morning and once in the afternoon) and the baits were replaced. After collecting the captured cats, the traps were removed.",

The weights of the captured feral cats were measured by weighing the trap with the captured cat and then subtracting the weight of the empty trap. Measurement of size, checking the gender, and attaching the tracking device was carried out by binding the four legs and blindfolding the cat. In the case of small mammals, the weight of the tracking device should be less than 5% of the weight of the animal to minimize any limitations in actions (Aldridge and Brigham, 1988; Choi and Park, 2006) .

Therefore, by using this method it was possible to track feral cats at similar time frames in five different regions. By dividing the location information sending pattern of tracking devices as long term (up to 21 days, 30 coordinates or more) and short term (up to 7 days, 100 coordinates or more), it aimed at collecting more diverse location information data.",

The collected location information was categorized into daytime and nighttime to calculate the home range. The cross time of daytime and nighttime was unified as 7 A.M. and 7 P.M. for consistency of data and convenience of analysis. 'A' was found to have daytime 100% MCP 27,900 m 2 , 95% KR 9,800 m 2 , 75% KR 2,700 m 2 , and 50% KR 1,400 m 2 , and nighttime 100% MCP 53,900 m 2 , 95% KR 25,200 m 2 , 75% KR 6,500 m 2 , and 50% KR 3,300 m 2 , showing that there was more nighttime movement than daytime movement. 'B' exhibited daytime 100% MCP 44,500 m 2 , 95% KR 37,800 m 2 , 75% KR 12,400 m 2 , and 50% KR 3,200 m 2 , and nighttime 100% MCP 38,400 m 2 , 95% KR 43,200 m 2 , 75% KR 17,100 m 2 , and 50% KR 6,300 m 2 , showing that the 100% MCP value was lower than the daytime, but had overall higher movement during the nighttime. It was found that there was more movement during nighttime compared to daytime for both 'A' and 'B', while feral cat 'A' showed much higher activity during the nighttime than the daytime.",

Particularly in the case of 'E' that showed very wide home ranges compared with other cats, it was captured in a village near the upstream of Geumgang (Riv.), which is a habitat for migratory birds, and the location tracking results showed that it moved from around the village to nearby farmlands, roads, and terrace land on rivers, as well as the river banks. While it cannot be precisely diagnosed on the reason why it showed much higher figures than other cats, when considering that it weighed a lot more than the feral cats captured in other regions and that it was near open terrains such as rivers and farmlands, it can be assumed that the physical features and the surrounding environment of the feral cat could be an important factor in determining the feral cat's home range.",
