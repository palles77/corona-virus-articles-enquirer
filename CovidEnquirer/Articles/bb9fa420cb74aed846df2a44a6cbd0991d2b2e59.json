At 1.2-\u03bcM concentration, lycorine reduced viral titers of West Nile (WNV), dengue, and yellow fever viruses by 10 2 -to 10 4 -fold. However, the compound did not inhibit an alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus) or a rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus), indicating a selective antiviral spectrum. The compound exerts its antiviral activity mainly through suppression of viral RNA replication. A Val \u2192 Met substitution at the 9th amino acid position of the viral 2K peptide (spanning the endoplasmic reticulum membrane between NS4A and NS4B proteins) confers WNV resistance to lycorine, through enhancement of viral RNA replication. Initial chemistry synthesis demonstrated that modifications of the two hydroxyl groups of lycorine can increase the compound's potency, while reducing its cytotoxicity. Taken together, the results have established lycorine as a flavivirus inhibitor for antiviral development. The lycorine-resistance results demonstrate a direct role of the 2K peptide in flavivirus RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "The family Flaviviridae consists of three genera, the flaviviruses, the pestiviruses, and the hepatitis C viruses. Many members of the genus Flavivirus are arthropod-borne human pathogens, including four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (Gubler et al., 2007) . More than 50 million, 200,000, and 50,000 human cases were reported annually for DENV, YFV, and JEV infections, respectively (Gubler et al., 2007) . Since the initial outbreak of WNV in New York in 1999, the virus has caused thousands of human cases of infections each year and has spread throughout North America (Kramer et al., 2007) . No effective antiviral therapy has been approved for the treatment of flavivirus infections. Human vaccines are currently available only for JEV, YFV, and TBEV. It has been well recognized that development of a vaccine for DENV is particularly challenging, because of the need to simultaneously immunize against all four DENV serotypes. Therefore, development of therapeutics is the priority for intervention in flavivirus infections.",

            "text": "The flavivirus genome is a plus-sense, single-stranded RNA of about 11,000 nucleotides (Lindenbach et al., 2007) . The genomic RNA consists of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame (ORF), and a 3\u2032UTR. The single ORF encodes a long polyprotein that is co-translationally and post-translationally processed by viral and host proteases into ten mature viral proteins. The N-terminus of the polyprotein contains three structural proteins: capsid (C), premembrane (prM/M), and envelope (E). The C-terminus of the polyprotein contains seven nonstructural (NS) proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. Complete cleavage of the polyprotein generates a 2K peptide between NS4A and NS4B. The 2K peptide spans the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Two viral proteins have enzymatic activities. NS3 functions as a protease (with NS2B as a cofactor), a nucleotide triphosphatase, an RNA triphosphatase, and a helicase (Falgout, Miller, and Lai, 1993; Li et al., 1999; Warrener et al., 1993; Wengler and Wengler, 1991) . NS5 acts as a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Egloff et al., 2002; Guyatt et al., 2001; Ray et al., 2006; Tan et al., 1996) . Besides functioning in replication, flaviviral NS proteins play roles in virion assembly (Jones et al., 2005; Kummerer and Rice, 2002; Leung et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2003) and evasion of host innate immune responses (Best et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Munoz-Jordan et al., 2005; Munoz-Jordan et al., 2003) . Upon viral entry and nucleocapsid uncoating, the genomic RNA is translated into proteins, which are translocated across the ER membrane to form the replication complexes (Lindenbach et al., 2007) . The molecular details of individual NS proteins and their roles in flavivirus replication remain to be characterized.",

To test whether lycorine inhibits flaviviruses, we initially screened the compound using a viral-like particle (VLP)based infection assay. As depicted in Fig. 1B , VLPs of WNV and DENV-1 were prepared by trans-supply viral structural proteins (CprME; through an alphavirus Semliki Forest virus [SFV] expression vector) to package corresponding replicon RNAs containing a luciferase reporter (Rluc2A-Rep). The titers of the VLPs were estimated to be 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 and 2.4 \u00d7 10 3 FFU/ml for WNV and DENV-1, respectively. Vero cells were infected with 1 FFU/cell of WNV VLP or with 0.01 FFU/cell of DENV-1 VLP (due to the low titer of DENV-1 VLP). The infected cells were treated with 1.5 \u03bcM lycorine or were mock-treated with 1% DMSO. At 24 h post-infection (p.i.), lycorine reduced the luciferase signals by 1400-and 1200-fold in the WNV and DENV-1 VLP-infected cells, respectively (Fig. 1C ). Higher concentrations of lycorine were also tested; however, due to cytotoxicity, these results are not presented (see next section). The results indicate that lycorine inhibits WNV and DENV-1.",

To pinpoint the step(s) of compound inhibition, we tested the compound in the Vero cell lines containing persistently replicating replicon of WNV or DENV (Rluc-Neo-Rep; Fig. 4A ). Incubation of the Rluc-Neo-Rep cells with 1.5-\u03bcM lycorine for 24 h or 48 h led to reduced luciferase activities, suggesting that the compound inhibits viral translation and/ or RNA synthesis. We then used a transient replicon system (Rluc2A-Rep; Fig. 4B ) to differentiate between inhibition of viral translation and inhibition of RNA synthesis. Previous studies showed that transfection of BHK-21 cells with the Rluc2A-Rep of WNV or DENV-1 produces two luciferase peaks, one at 1 to 8 h post-transfection (p.t.), and another at N20 h p.t.; these respectively represent viral translation and RNA replication Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2006) . As shown in Fig. 4B , whereas lycorine suppressed early luciferase signals (at 2, 4, and 6 h p.t.) by b30%, it reduced late luciferase signals (at 24, 30 and 48 h p.t.) by N99%.

Three independent selections (I-III) were performed. For each selection, a total of 12 passages were carried out, with the first 6 passages (P1-P6) selected at 0.8 \u03bcM lycorine and the last 6 passages (P7-P12) selected at 1.2 \u03bcM lycorine. Viruses from each passage were assayed for their resistance, through comparison of viral titers from mock-treated infection with viral titers from lycorine-treated infection (harvested at 42 h p.i.). Fig. 5B shows representative data from such resistance assays for P1, P3, P6, P9, and P12. Viral resistance gradually improved from P1 to P10; no further improvement was observed from P10 to P12 ( Fig. 5B and data not shown). We therefore terminated the selections at P12. Notably, the P12 viruses did not show complete resistance to lycorine. At 1.2 \u03bcM, the compound reduced viral titers of P12 virus-infected cells by approximately 10-fold. In contrast, the compound suppressed viral titers of the WT virus-infected cells by about 1000-fold at the same concentration (Fig. 5B ). The results indicated that the resistance of the P12 viruses increased by approximately 100-fold over that of the WT. Similar results were obtained for all three independent selections. Plaque morphologies of the WT and lycorine-resistant P12 viruses were compared in agar containing no lycorine (Fig. 5C ). Plaques derived from the P12 viruses were slightly more heterogeneous in size than the plaques derived from the WT virus, indicating that the P12 viruses were composed of quasispecies. However, the majority of the plaques from the P12 viruses are similar in size to the plaques derived from the WT virus. Collectively, the results demonstrated that WNVs partially resistant to lycorine can be reproducibly selected in cell culture.",

The four mutant viruses exhibited different plaque morphologies: the two viruses containing the silent mutations (C1161U and A1287C) yielded plaques similar to those of the WT virus, whereas the mutant viruses containing amino acid changes in the E protein (C1418U and U1789C) generated smaller plaques than those of the WT virus. Resistance assays showed that, after treatment of infected cells (0.1 MOI) with lycorine (1.2 \u03bcM lycorine for 42 h), none of the four mutants yielded viral titers that were significantly higher than the titers of the WT virus (Fig. 6C) . The results indicate that the E mutations are not responsible for resistance. Notably, the smaller plaques (Fig. 6B ) and the lower titers from mock-treated infections for mutant viruses U1789C and C1418U (Fig. 6C) suggest that the amino acid changes in the E gene negatively affect viral replication.",

First, a VLP-infectionbased assay allowed identification of inhibitors of viral entry and replication (Fig. 1C) . Second, use of Replicon-containing cell lines allowed screening for inhibitors of viral replication (Fig. 4A) . Third, a transient replicon assay allowed differentiation between inhibitors of translation and inhibitors of RNA synthesis (Fig. 4B) . Analysis of the compound in the above systems indicated that whereas lycorine only weakly reduces viral translation (b30%, as indicated by luciferase activity), it significantly suppresses RNA synthesis (N99%, as indicated by luciferase activity). The reduction of RNA synthesis could be caused by the compound-mediated suppression of viral translation. Alternatively, lycorine could suppress both translation and RNA synthesis, leading to the dramatic reduction of RNA synthesis. To differentiate between the above two possibilities, we performed a time-of-addition experiment. The results showed that lycorine gradually declined its anti-WNV activity, when the time of addition was varied from 0 to 10 h p.i.; the compound completely lost the inhibitory activity when added at N10 p.i. (Fig. 4C) . A single round of flavivirus infection is about 12 h in duration, with viral translation peaking around 2-6 h p.i. and RNA synthesis peaking around 7-12 h p.i. (Chambers et al., 1990; Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2005) . If lycorine only inhibited the step of translation, it would have completely lost its antiviral activity when added at a time point Fig. 7 .

Vero cells, in a 12-well plate, were infected with WNV (WT and G6871A MT) at an MOI of 5, incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated at 37\u00b0C with medium containing 1.2-\u03bcM lycorine or with medium containing 1% DMSO. At 16, 24, 36, and 48 h p.i., viral titers in supernatants were determined by plaque assays (A). The infected cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed with 250 \u03bcl of lysis buffer, and frozen at-80\u00b0C. The cell lysates (10 \u03bcl) were analyzed by western blotting (B). Four monoclonal antibodies against NS1 (1:1000 dilution; purchased from Sigma), NS3 (1:4000 dilution; in-house generated), NS5 (1:4000 dilution; in-house generated), or \u03b2-actin (1:1000 dilution; purchased from Chemicon) were mixed and used as primary antibodies. Horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:4000 dilution) was used as a secondary antibody. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. One representative of two experiments is shown. earlier than 10 h p.i. (i.e., at 6 h p.i.). Therefore, the time-of-addition results clearly indicate that the compound inhibits a step beyond viral translation. These data, together with the identification of the resistance determinant in the 2K peptide (Fig. 6) , led us to conclude that lycorine suppresses WNV mainly through suppression of viral RNA synthesis.",

The first approach was to test the compound in biochemical enzyme assays using recombinant protease (with NS2B), NTPase, RdRp, and MTase proteins. None of the enzyme activities were suppressed by lycorine. The second approach was to select compound-resistant WNV. We selected resistant WNVs in cell culture. Engineering of the mutations (recovered from the resistant viruses) into an infectious clone (Fig. 6) and a replicon (Fig. 8A) of WNV allowed us to map the resistance determinant to a single aminoacid change (Val9Met) in the 2K peptide. It should be noted that the resistance results do not necessarily indicate that the 2K peptide is the direct target for lycorine. The 2K peptide mutation could exert its resistance phenotype through enhancement of viral replication so Resistance and replication analyses using WNV replicon. The effect of the G6871A mutation in the 2K peptide on resistance to lycorine was quantified using a transient replicon (Rluc2A-Rep) assay. Equal amounts (10 \u03bcg) of WT and G6871A mutant replicon RNAs were electroporated into BHK-21 cells. The transfected cells were immediately treated with lycorine (1.5 \u03bcM) or without lycorine (1% DMSO as controls). Luciferase activities were measured at the indicated time points post-transfection. Average results from three independent experiments are presented. (B) Growth kinetics of WT and 2K peptide G6871A mutant viruses. Vero and C6/36 cells were infected with the WT and the 2K peptide mutant viruses at an MOI of 0.05. After 1-h incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and the medium was replenished. Viral titers in culture fluids were quantified at the indicated time points using plaque assays. that, in the presence of inhibitor, viral replication could still be sustained at a level sufficient to generate virus. The latter scenario is supported by the observations that the 2K peptide mutation enhanced RNA synthesis of WNV replicon as well as the growth kinetics of WNV in Vero and C6/36 cells (Fig. 8) . However, it should be pointed out that the 2K mutation-mediated enhancement of viral replication only partially contributes to the lycorine resistance. The latter conclusion was supported by the results that the 2K mutation increased replication by only 2 to 4-fold in the absence of lycorine (Fig. 8B) , whereas the same mutation increased replication by N100-fold in the presence of the inhibitor (Fig. 7A) .",

Flavivirus 2K peptide spans the ER membrane with its N-and Cterminal tails on the cytoplasmic and ER lumen sides, respectively (Miller et al., 2007) . The cleavage at the 2K-NS4B junction by host signalase requires a prior cleavage at the NS4A-2K junction by viral NS2B/NS3 protease (Lin et al., 1993) . The regulated cleavages at the NS4A-2K-NS4B sites play a role in rearranging cytoplasmic membranes (Miller et al., 2007; Roosendaal et al., 2006) . The exact function of the 2K peptide in induction of membrane arrangement may differ among flaviviruses. In KUNV, individual expression of NS4A-2K resulted in membrane rearrangements that most resembling virus-induced structures, while removal of the 2K domain led to a less profound membrane rearrangement (Roosendaal et al., 2006) . In contrast, expression of DENV-2 NS4A without 2K peptide resulted in altered membranes resembling virus-induced structures, whereas expression of NS4A-2K did not induce comparable membrane arrangement (Miller et al., 2007) . Since the rearranged membranes form the scaffold for the viral replication complex, the Val9Met mutation may affect the 2K peptide-mediated membrane alterations, leading to an increase in RNA replication.",

The weakened interferon response allowed the virus to replicate to a higher level. This hypothesis is supported by our observations that the same 2K peptide mutation was recovered from the WNV that was able to perform superinfections (Zhang and Shi, unpublished data). In the later study, we found that the 2K peptide mutant virus showed improved capability to replicate in cells that contain persistently replicating replicon of WNV. One caveat to this hypothesis is that our lycorine resistance study was performed in Vero cells, in which the interferon gene has been deleted (Mosca and Pitha, 1986) . More experiments are required to dissect the molecular mechanism of the 2K peptide that is operative in flavivirus replication or in evasion of the host immune response.",

Each replicon contains a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A sequence in the position where the viral structural genes (CprME) were deleted (Rluc2A-Rep; Fig. 1B ). The construction and characterization of the WNV and DENV-1 Rluc2A-Rep were reported previously Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2006) . The structural genes of each virus were cloned into an SFV expression vector (Invitrogen) (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991) at a unique Bam HI site, resulting in SFV-CprME (Fig. 1B) . A Kozak sequence and a stop codon were engineered at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the CprME fragment, respectively. A doubletransfection protocol was used to generate the VLPs (Khromykh et al., 1998; Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2005) . Briefly, BHK-21 cells (8 \u00d7 10 6 ) were first electroporated with 10 \u03bcg of Rluc2A-Rep RNA in a 0.4-cm cuvette with the GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) using settings of 0.85 kV and 25 \u03bcF, pulsing three times at 3-sec intervals. The transfected cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 for 24 h. The replicon-transfected cells were then electroporated with 10 \u03bcg of SFV-CprME RNA of the corresponding virus, at the settings identical to those used for the first transfection. At 24 h after the second transfection, culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The VLPs in the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at-80\u00b0C. The titers of VLPs (in focus-forming units [FFU]/ml) were estimated by infection of Vero cells in a four-chamber Lab-Tek Chamber Slide (Nalge Nunc International) with serial dilutions of the culture fluid, followed by counting of immunofluorescence assay (IFA)-positive cell foci at 18 and 24 h p.i. for WNV and DENV-1, respectively. For IFA, immune mouse ascites fluid of WNV or DENV-1 (American Type Culture Collection) and goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugated with Texas Red were used as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively.",
