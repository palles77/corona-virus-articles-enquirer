            "text": "The association of the nucleocapsid with the envelope is also mediated by M proteins, by its binding capacity to the nucleocapsid. The intracellular membranes such as the Golgi apparatus or smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contain the viral glycoproteins. because they pass through these membranes during transport from the site of synthesis, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), to the plasma membrane (Nagai et al., 1976a; Lamb and Choppin, 1977) . However, paramyxoviruses as well as certain other enveloped RNA viruses such as orthomyxoviruses do not bud from intracellular membranes but do so exclusively from the plasma membrane. There could be a number of explanations for this selectivity of the virus assembly site, and, in view of the above role of M protein in virus assembly, it is important to clarify whether or not M protein can recognize intracellular membranes containing viral glycoproteins. Previous cell fractionation studies have shown that the M protein is indeed present in the intracellular smooth membrane fraction (Nagai et al., 1976a; Lamb and Choppin, 1977) . However, the amount present there relative to the glycoproteins seemed to vary significantly depending on the virus-cell system used; it is usually low in NDV-infected cells (Nagai et al., 1976a) but relatively high in Sendai virus-infected cells (Lamb and Choppin, 1977) . In addition, low levels of contamination with membrane vesicles derived from plasma membrane seem to be inevitable in that type of study (Nagai et al., 1976a) . Therefore, the specificity of M protein for association with intracellular smooth membranes has not yet been firmly established. It also appears important to define whether or not such a direct interaction of M and the lipid bilayer is involved in the virus assembly, as suggested for the assembly of influenza virus (Gregoriades, 1980; Gregoriades and Frangione, 1981) . Monensin, a linear polyether with a high affinity for Na+ ions (Pressman, 1976) is known to block the transport to the cell surface of various viral and secretory proteins (Tartakoff, 1983) . Therefore, we have been able to use monensin to change greatly the quantitative distribution of viral glycoproteins between plasma membranes and internal membranes, so that the latter are greatly enriched while the former contain low levels. Under such conditions, we examined the intracellular behavior of M protein of NDV and show that it can neither interact with those intracellular membranes even if large amounts of viral glycoproteins accumulate there, nor bind to the plasma membrane devoid of the glycoproteins.",

This latter observation indicates that the glycoprotein transport could be blocked between cis and trans stacks of the Golgi complex, because galactosyltransferase is restricted to the trans face of the Golgi complex (Griffiths et al.. 1982; Roth and Berger, 1982) whereas removal of mannose and attachment of peripheral N-acetylglucosamine may occur in some or all of the remaining cisternae on the cis side of the Golgi stack (Dunphy and Rothman, 1983) . The transport block between cis and trans Golgi membranes was also supported by the finding that monensin did not block the attachment of palmitic acid to the F,, glycoprotein (not shown), since fatty acid addition to glycoproteins seems to occur within the Golgi complex, probably in the cis side (Schmidt and Schlessinger, 1980; Griffiths et al., 1983) .

As shown in Fig. 5 , all the viral polypeptid~s including M were greatly reduced in amount in the plasma membrane of monensintreated cells. We compared the protein species contained in the ghosts from monensin-treated and -untreated cells with each other by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie blue staining, and found that there was no marked difference except that some viral proteins (NP and M) could be additionally visualized in the untreated ghosts but not in the treated ones (data not shown). This result would eliminate the possibility that the plasma membranes from monensintreated cells could fractionate very differently from those of untreated cells. These results confirm that monensin blocks the transport of viral glycoproteins to the plasma membrane and indicate that M and the other viral proteins also do not associate with the plasma membrane in the presence of the drug. It appears likely either that monensin blocks directly the transport of M to the plasma membrane or that viral glycoprotein insertion into the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for the association of M. Evidence available suggests the latter possibility. because M associates directly with the plasma membrane through a route different from that of viral glycoproteins (Nagai et al., 1976a: Lamb and Choppin. 1977) and thus probably insensitive to monensin.",

The smooth membrane vesicles were treated with trypsin or chymotrypsin. which digests only proteins exposed on the external (cytoplasmic) surface of the membrane vesicles. The digestion products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 7 . significant amounts of NP were degraded upon treatment of the vesicles with trypsin. whereas HN, and F,, resisted the digestion except that the apparent molecular weight of F,, changed from 68 500 to 66000. Although consistently observed, the decrease of molecular weight of HN,, by the digestion appeared to be much smaller than that of F,,. This may indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of HN, may be smaller or that the domain may be less sensitive to the protease used. When the organization of the vesicles was disrupted by treatment with Triton X-100, all the viral proteins were extensively digested with trypsin. Similar results were obtained upon treatment of the vesicles with chymotrypsin. These results suggest that the glycoproteins are present as transmembrane proteins on the Golgi membrane so that its cytoplasmic domain may be able to interact with M protein.",

Some paramyxoviruses are very sensitive to the change in ionic milieu caused by ouabain, an inhibitor of Na,K-ATPase (Nagai et al., 1972) and thus the effect of monensin shown here could also be explained from this aspect. However, this appears also unlikely because NDV is relatively resistant to ouabain (Nagai et al., 1972) .The inhibition of proteolytic cleavage of virulent NDV F, by monensin suggests that the enzyme for the cleavage of BHK cells is present somewhere after the monensin-sensitive step in the course of viral glycoprotein transport. This result is compatible with that of Morrison et al. (1985) showing a similar intracellular localization of the proteolytic enzyme for NDV F,, in chick embryo cells.",
