Visualization is facilitated by shaving or plucking the fur or by the liberal use of alcohol to wet down the area. Rabbit veins are fragile and prone to hematoma formation. A small volume of blood (e.g., 0.1 to 0.3 mL) can be collected by venipuncture of the cephalic or lateral saphenous vein using a low-dose insulin syringe with 27-g needle or a tuberculin syringe with 25-g needle. In medium-size to larger rabbits, these veins are large enough to collect 1 to 3 mL with a 22-to 25-g needle or butterfly catheter. Restraint may be easier for cephalic than for lateral saphenous venipunctur~ if a rabbit tries to kick with the rear legs. \u00b7 The author uses the jugular vein for collection of most blood samples (Fig. 4 ). An assistant is needed to hold the patient in sternal recumbency at the edge of a table with the head extended up and the forelegs pulled down. The jugular vein is large, superficial, and relatively laterally placed. If the vein cannot be visualized, it is often palpable as a soft area with associated fremitus. A 22-ga or larger needle can be used for blood collection in most rabbits.

            "text": "Enteric diseases are an important economic problem for commercial rabbit breeders. They are the subject of ongoing, intensive research in many countries. Enteritis is usually associated with decreased GI motility, which, in turn, results in diarrhea. Therefore, diarrhea in rabbits is often the result of constipation, a seeming contradiction. 8 In pet rabbits, three diarrhea syndromes are most common: acute diarrhea in young, newly acquired animals; a chronic diarrhea in older animals; and antibiotic-induced diarrhea. For further information, the reader is referred to more detailed references. 5 \u2022 6 \u2022 8 Under commercial conditions, enteric diseases are most common in weanling rabbits. Onset is related to the stress and change in diet that occur at weaning time. Clostridium spiroforme and Escherichia coli are the most important enteric pathogens. Rotaviruses and coccidiosis may contribute or predispose to enteritis; however, they are not considered to be primary pathogens. 8 Lack of dietary fiber, soluble carbohydrate overload, and high protein level are important factors also insofar as they, respectively, decrease GI motility, alter cecal pH, and increase cecal ammonia level. The susceptibility to enteritis also appears to have a genetic component. In addition, stress plays a role because it causes a decrease in intestinal motility. The \"enteritis complex\" usually refers to enterotoxemia and mucoid enteritis. 8 Enterotoxemia is the result of secretion of toxins by pathogenic bacteria in the GI tract. Two factors are necessary for this to occur: an alteration of normal GI flora in conjunction with the presence of pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, this condition is truly an infection. 6 C. spiroforme a semi-circular gram-positive rod, is thebest documented cause. It produces an extracellular enterotoxin, iota toxin, when in the presence of glucose. 8 Colonization occurs in weanling rabbits and adult animals that are under environmental stress or treatment with certain antibiotics, including clindamycin, lincomycin, penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin. Signs of enterotoxemia include diarrhea, depression, and sudden death. Definitive diagnosis is with isolation of the organism and demonstration of the toxin. A presumptive diagnosis is made by demonstrating the spiral, C-, U-, and 5-shaped microcolonies of C. spiroforme, beaded gram-positive, in gram-stained feces. 5 \u2022 7 The condition is usually rapidly fatal. However, if there is time to institute treatment, a good therapeutic choice might be one of the drugs used for clostridial colitis in humans, namely metronidazole, vancomycin, or bacitracin. 5 \u2022 6 The term \"mucoid enteritis\" has been used to describe different enteric conditions in rabbits. Currently, it is used to describe a condition in whieh cecal motility is impaired and a hard mass of particulate matter impacts in the cecum. 8 The condition is promoted by inadequate dietary fiber, which decreases cecal motility, and high environmental temperatures, which increase fluid requirements and cause water to be drawn out of the cecum. Diarrhea and excretion of mucus are the results. Affected rabbits have a hunched posture and tend to stay over the water bowl. When handled, these rabbits sound like a hollow water bottle. The condition has a high mortality rate.",

Higher rates of infection in young rabbits seem to be related to late weaning, vaginal infection in the dams, and a high rate of infection in the colonyPThe portal of entry of Pasteurella is usually the respiratory tract, especially the nasopharynx. Spread of infection is hematogenous, lymphatic, through the trachea, or along the Eustachian tube. The dorsal soft palate, tympanic bulla, nasal turbinates, and paranasal sinuses may be sites of lifelong infection.27 Asymptomatic carriers are common, and the infection is difficult, if not impossible, to eradicate in known infected animals.",
