            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered virus that causes respiratory illness in children that can lead to hospitalization. Our study was undertaken to further understand hMPV-associated illness, compare clinical characteristics of hMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and establish the utility of routine screening for hMPV. We retrospectively identified hMPV-associated illnesses described among children with respiratory symptoms admitted to a tertiary care center in southeast Michigan during the 2006-2007 respiratory viral season. A convenience sample of 256 nasopharyngeal specimens was subjected to nucleic acid extraction and amplification to identify those specimens positive for hMPV. A medical record review was undertaken to retrieve demographic and clinical data of patients with hMPV, comparing them to RSVpositive patients and patients evaluated for respiratory symptoms who were negative for hMPV and RSV. We found that hMPV was the second most commonly identified virus after RSV. hMPV-positive patients were older than RSV-positive patients. Among hMPV-positive patients, pneumonia was diagnosed in 37.5% and bronchiolitis in 31.2%, peribronchial cuffing was present on chest radiographs of 37.5%, antibiotic treatment was used in 81.2%, and admission to the ICU was seen in 37.5%. Finally, hMPV-positive patients were more likely to have fever than RSV-positive patients or patients negative for hMPV and RSV. We concluded that hMPV is a major pathogen associated with hospitalization of children and with the same severity of illness as RSV but in a slightly older population. Because of the apparent prevalence and severity of illness, routine screening should be implemented.

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] It has been implicated as a significant cause of hospitalization for young children, 1 second only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants hospitalized with acute respiratory infections (ARIs). 15 hMPV has been detected in 1.5-43.0% of patients with ARIs. 5 While it circulates predominantly in the winter, infections have been reported year-round [16] [17] [18] and the incidence varies yearly. 5, [18] [19] [20] [21] Seroprevalence studies have shown that almost all children over five years of age have evidence of past infection. 22 Past infection with hMPV is thought to confer only partial immunity to subsequent infections. 2, 13, 14 Clinical syndromes associated with hMPV infection are similar to those of RSV infection, 4, 23 ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infections to wheezing and severe lower respiratory tract infections requiring mechanical ventilation. 2, 11, [23] [24] [25] [26] Rare cases of fatalities have been associated with hMPV 11, [27] [28] [29] [30] and it has been implicated in a handful of cases of encephalitis. 12, 31, 32 Although hMPV infections have been diagnosed in adults, their greatest impact occurs in children. 33 A significant association with hMPV and wheezing is seen in young children, 23, 34, 35 and hMPV has been linked to apparent life-threatening events in infants. 25 hMPV has been associated with ARIs with super-infections as a result of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 2 To begin to understand the impact of hMPV on our institution, we analyzed children admitted to our tertiary care center in southeast Michigan with respiratory symptoms during the respiratory season of 2006-2007 through an observational, retrospective study. The primary purposes of our study were to establish the utility of testing for hMPV in children who were admitted to our hospital during the respiratory virus season and to compare the impact of hMPV and RSV on the healthcare system.",

After routine testing by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and/or culture for RSV, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses A and B, adenovirus, and rhinovirus, the NP specimens were frozen at -70\u00b0C and later subjected to nucleic acid extraction using the EasyMag system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC, USA) and following the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications. Two hundred microliters of each specimen were pre-treated with 20 units of DNase (New England Biolabs, UK) at 37\u00b0C for 45 min before extraction. Extracts were used as the template for detection of hMPV using the NucliSense real-time analyte specific reagent (ASR) assay performed on the EasyQ instrument (bioM\u00e9rieux). A proprietary internal control containing the same primer binding sites as the hMPV target with unique internal sequences targeted by a separate molecular beacon probe were spiked into each specimen before extraction to monitor amplification integrity.",

This difference is likely because of a requirement of three independent radiologists' interpretations of the radiographs in the earlier study compared to the diagnosis of one admitting physician in our study. hMPV-positive patients were more likely than the other two groups to have peribronchial cuffing on their chest radiographs, evidence suggesting that these patients have interstitial edema, likely a result of the disruption of the respiratory epithelial structure and inflammation that hMPV has been shown to cause in animal studies. 38 hMPV may have a stronger predilection for the respiratory epithelial cells than RSV, corroborated by reports that hMPV-positive patients frequently exhibited signs of otitis media. 33 Further research is needed on the pathogenesis of hMPV in humans, specifically regarding the ability of hMPV to infect human respiratory epithelial cells compared to RSV and other viruses. The present study demonstrates, as previously reported, 23 that hMPVpositive patients were as likely to be severely ill as were RSV-positive patients. In fact, in our study, hMPV-positive patients were more likely than RSV-positive patients to be admitted to the ICU even though they were not more likely to have an underlying medical illness. In addition, hMPV-positive patients were more likely than were RSV-positive patients to receive antibiotics. During the study time period, our institution did not routinely test specimens for hMPV. Physicians may have used antibiotics more often in patients only retrospectively shown to be hMPV-positive because they were not aware of a specific virus contributing to these patients' illnesses. The finding of increased antibiotic use in children with other ARIs, most of whom had negative viral cultures, corroborates this suggestion. It is also possible that the increased diagnosis of pneumonia in the hMPV-positive patients contributed to the increased use of antibiotics. Routine diagnostic testing for hMPV therefore may reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics. Previous reports have suggested that hMPV and RSV are clinically indistinguishable. 17, 21 This study, however, shows that there may be subtle differences in the clinical features of hMPV and RSV infections. As previously reported, 34 fever was the most common presenting symptom for hMPV-positive patients and was more common in hMPV-positive children than in the other two groups. hMPV-positive patients were also more likely to experience decreased urinary output than patients negative for hMPV and RSV. The raised fever may increase the likelihood of dehydration and decreased urinary output. More information is needed to compare the level of inflammation produced by hMPV with that of other viruses.",

As such, it is possible that children infected with RSV were assigned to the group of patients not infected with hMPV or RSV.
