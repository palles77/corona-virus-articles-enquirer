Study design: During a 4-month period in the winter season 2006/2007 we collected nasopharyngeal aspirations from children who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics. All samples were examined for 17 agents with real-time PCR. Results: HBoV was detected in 45 of 376 samples (12%). The occurrence of HBoV was stable during the study period. Multiple viral infections were present in 78% of the samples (42% double, 20% triple and 16% quadruple infections). RS-virus, enterovirus and human metapneumovirus were the most frequently codetected agents. In samples with a high load for HBoV, significantly fewer multiple infections were found than in the other samples. Eighty-eight percent of the 25 patients with HBoV recorded as either the only or the dominating virus, and 50% of the other patients, had lower respiratory tract infection. The difference was statistically significant. Conclusions: HBoV was frequently detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from children with airway infections in Norway. Multiple viral infections were common among the HBoV-infected patients. Semiquantitive PCR results may be useful for interpretation of clinical relevance.",

In the total material (n = 376) HBoV was detected in all seven samples containing four viruses, and in half of the samples containing three viruses. Similar figures were found for enterovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43. In contrast, this tendency was not demonstrable for RS-virus and influenza A-virus. Long-time shedding of HBoV, enterovirus, coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus is a possible explanation. When a single sample can contain as many as four or more viruses it becomes difficult to evaluate the clinical significance of each virus. One way to solve this problem may be to quantify the individual viral nucleic acids. Quantitative analysis of nasopharyngeal aspirates is methodologically difficult because the quality of the specimens obtained varies from person to person depending on sampling technique and the condition of the patients' nasal mucosa. An exact quantitation may consequently give misleading results. We have therefore chosen to do a semiquantitive analysis and roughly group the results in three categories. Our results indicate that this approach can be fruitful. In samples with a high load of HBoV few other viruses were detected. This indicates that assessment of viral load may be of clinical relevance, but a prospective study including clinical data and a control group is needed for this question to be fully addressed.",

HBoV was found in feces from two patients. One of them had gastroenteritis. In the fecal sample from this patient rotavirus was also detected giving a probable explanation for the gastroenteritis. In a recent study HBoV was proposed as a cause of gastroenteritis (Vicente et al., 2007) . We therefore examined 101 fecal samples from uns-elected patients of all age groups with gastroenteritis. Only one specimen was positive for HBoV. This was a 1-year-old boy who also tested positive for rotavirus. Furthermore, he had a respiratory illness four weeks before the gastroenteritis.
