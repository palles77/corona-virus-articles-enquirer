BRYAN YOUNG noninfectious processes such as trauma, burns, and pancreatitis. 3 The chief clinical features of this syndrome are two or more of the following: (1) temperature exceeding 38\u00b0C or less than 36\u00b0C, (2) heart rate greater than 90 beats/min, (3) respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths/min or arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco 2 ) less than 32 torr (4.3 kPa), and (4) white blood cell count (WBC) more than 12,000 cells/mm 3 or with more than 10 percent immature (band) forms. 3 SIRS may be accompanied by hypotension (blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or a reduction of more than 40 mmHg from baseline in the absence of other causes of hypotension). 4 In SIRS, cellular and humoral responses are activated 2, 5 to produce changes in the microcirculation throughout the body (Fig. 52-1) . The cellular response involves epithelial and endothelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. These induce the humoral response; pro-infl ammatory mediators are activated locally and include interleukins-1, -2, and -6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, arachidonic acid, coagulation factors, free oxygen radicals, and proteases. These cellular and humoral factors interact with themselves and with adhesion molecules, which are increased in the blood of septic patients. 6 Adhesion molecules adhere to leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells; they also induce \"rolling neutrophils\" and fi brin platelet aggregates that obstruct capillary fl ow. Endothelial damage increases capillary permeability, which induces local tissue edema.",

In modern general medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs), where at least 25 percent of patients may have this condition, 1 it has become synonymous with the syndrome of sepsis and multiple organ failure. This syndrome has probably always been a component of preterminal illness, but before the advent of modern methods of treatment, the syndrome evolved so quickly that the nature of the preterminal events was not considered. However, with the use of intravenous transfusions, antibiotics, activated protein C, and improvements in assisted ventilation, patients are now kept alive for days, weeks, and even months in intensive or critical care units, and as many as 40 percent recover. 1,2 Thus, it is now possible to study the syndrome in detail, and its effects on the various major organ systems, including the central and peripheral nervous systems.",

However, in many instances the offending organism cannot be cultured. For example, blood cultures are ne gative in half of the patients suspected of being septic. Moreover, the criteria for diagnosing sepsis based on systemic responses are still unsettled. The term systemic infl ammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should now be applied to a severe clinical insult that arises not only as the result of infection but also as the result of Levels of protein C are reduced in sepsis. 2 Endothelial damage impairs the endothelium-dependent activation of protein C, thus shifting the balance to thrombosis. 7, 8 Activation of nitric oxide, now known to be the endovascular relaxing factor, causes arteriolar dilation, which may further slow capillary fl ow. Thus, essential nutrients fail to reach the organ parenchyma. For example, despite adequate oxygenation via mechanical ventilation, there is a severe oxygen debt at the parenchymal level contributing to multiple organ dysfunction. 5 Considering the profound disturbances of the microcirculation and the impaired delivery of substrates, especially oxygen and glucose, upon which the nervous system depends, it is not surprising that the nervous system is affected. There is no known specifi c treatment, but it is known that if the underlying sepsis can be brought under control by either medical or surgical means, the various manifestations of the syndrome disappear and full recovery is possible.",

There is little doubt that these invasive procedures induce the state of sepsis if it was not already present.

More severe EEG abnormalities, which correlated with more profound depression of consciousness, consisted of greater slowing (delta activity), triphasic waves, or a burstsuppression pattern ( Fig. 52 -2). 13 Using computational nonlinear analysis techniques, Straver and colleagues showed that EEG features correlated with the severity of illness and that the EEG became disorganized with greater severity of illness, suggesting a shift in the processing ability of the brain. 14 Although there is a direct relationship between the degree of EEG abnormality and mortality, some patients with even the most severe categories of abnormality recover. Thus, the EEG cannot be used to predict a hopeless prognosis in septic encephalopathy. 13, 14 Serum levels of creatinine and bilirubin showed a direct, linear correlation with the severity of the encephalopathy. 13 Although hyperventilation is a feature of sepsis, there were no signifi cant differences in blood pH, bicarbonate, or Pco 2 among the three groups.

Nitric oxide is the \"vascular relaxing factor\"; its synthesis is increased by endotoxin and cytokines in sepsis, leading to reduced peripheral vascular resistance and hypotension. Although this seems counterproductive, such multifocal vasodilatation helps ensure adequate organ perfusion in sepsis; inhibition of nitric oxide production can lead to decreased organ perfusion and a fall in oxygen extraction by tissues. 16 Nitric oxide plays an important role in regulating brain circulation and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. 17 Endothelial damage in sepsis may then compromise regional cerebral blood-fl ow and account for the multifocal, dynamic increases in blood-brain (and possibly bloodnerve) permeability mentioned earlier.

The combined effect increases tissue edema and alters the chemical milieu of the interstitial fl uid of the brain. Cytokines themselves may directly affect brain function. Again, their access to the brain may be facilitated by alterations in blood-brain barrier function. When directly injected into the brain or ventricles of animals, interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 alter behavior and EEG frequencies. 21 Interleukin-1 facilitates sleep and induces fever by its effects on the hypothalamus. Some of these effects relate to activation of opiate receptors in the brain; the possibility of effects on other peptide systems in the brain remains to be explored. Proinfl ammatory cytokines may also activate STAT 3, a transcription molecule, in astrocytes. 22 The signifi cance of this is not clear, but astrocytes play a key role in maintaining a homeostatic environment for CNS neurons. Lipopolysaccharides and proinfl ammatory cytokines, including interferon-gamma, upregulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) in astrocytes. 23 This leads to the production of reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide and superoxide, causing oxidative stress for astrocytes and neurons of the brain.",

The latter include higher ratios of aromatic to branched-chain amino acids (increased in the plasma because of altered metabolism in liver and muscle) and increased exposure to other peptides and hormones. Such changes play a role in the documented alteration of certain putative neurotransmitters in sepsis, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Additional neurotransmitter alterations include increased serotonin turnover and decreased noradrenergic transmission in the brain in sepsis. 24 A similar derangement in neurotransmitter balance occurs in hepatic and uremic encephalopathy. Astrocytic dysfunction, mentioned earlier, contributes to increases in extracellular glutamate, an excitotoxic neurotransmitter that can cause neuronal death or seizures through activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. 25 The brain may also be affected indirectly because of the failure or altered metabolism of other organ systems. Within 5 hours from the onset of sepsis, the liver shows impaired ability to clear indocyanine green. We have found an elevated serum bilirubin concentration in sepsis, with a direct relationship to the severity of the encephalopathy. 12 Endogenous benzodiazepinelike substance is also increased in hepatic failure. 26 Although this has not been explored in sepsis, we have found that some patients with septic encephalopathy may improve with fl umazenil, a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A antagonist, even in the absence of exogenous benzodiazepines (unpublished observations).",

The limbs are not easily assessed, owing to the presence of intravenous lines, splints, bandages, and so forth.

Using electrophysiological tests, we have found that both septic encephalopathy and critical illness polyneuropathy are almost invariable manifestations of the sepsis and multiple organ failure syndrome, and the other conditions listed in the table are only rarely involved. In fact, these other conditions are usually evident before the patient has been admitted to the critical care unit and are the obvious reason for neuro- 38 Upper-and lower-limb motor and sensory conduction studies initially reveal only a reduction in the amplitude of compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials, with no change in latency or conduction velocity.

Neither the nerve nor the muscle shows any infl ammatory change. Aside from chromatolysis of the anterior horn cells secondary to the peripheral axonal injury, the CNS is spared. Axonal degeneration of intercostal and phrenic nerves and denervation atrophy of respiratory muscles explain the respiratory insuffi ciency. Latronico and associates found that some patients have abnormal electrophysiological but normal biopsy fi ndings of nerve and muscle, suggesting that functional changes precede structural alterations. 40 The mechanism of the polyneuropathy is not known. However, our investigations have excluded potential causes of polyneuropathy, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, various toxins, drugs (particularly antibiotics), and nutritional defi ciency. 41 It is our belief that the polyneuropathy is probably caused by the same fundamental defect that affects all organ systems in the critical illness syndrome through involvement of the microcirculation (Fig. 52-1) . We speculate 41 that the primary axonal damage may be due to involvement of axonal transport systems, which are known to be energydependent; this fact may explain why predominantly distal nerve segments are involved. Moreover, it is known that the blood-nerve barrier, in contrast to the blood-brain barrier, shows increased permeability to his tamine and serotonin. Several mediators of the septic syndrome are known to have histamine-like action. Circulating \"toxins\" could potentially gain access to the endoneurial space and directly damage the axon. It is also possible that disturbance of the microcirculation, as has been postulated to occur in sepsis and multiple organ failure, is the mechanism by which these events in peripheral nerve are initiated.",

[34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Since as many as 50 percent of patients in major medical and surgical critical care units have the syndrome, critical illness polyneuropathy must now be regarded as a particularly common neuromuscular disorder. Critical illness myopathy may be common in units that frequently use neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids. 39 The fi rst, and often the only, clinical sign of critical illness polyneuropathy is respiratory muscle weakness, manifested as a diffi culty in weaning from the me chanical ventilator. Other neuromuscular causes of diffi culty in weaning may be trauma to the phrenic nerve, neuromuscular transmission defect, primary myopathy, and disorders of central drive due to an associated encephalopathy. 31 In severe critical illness polyneuropathy there are weak or absent movements of the limbs, even when the limbs are stimulated distally by pressure over the nail beds. Tendon refl exes that were previously present cannot be elicited. By contrast, head, face, and jaw movements are relatively preserved. In two of our patients, this absence of movement in the extremities but preservation of movement of the head had erroneously been diagnosed as resulting from high cervical spinal cord disease. Pati ents with lesser degrees of polyneuropathy show more equivocal signs, with variably weak muscles, particularly distally, and reduced or absent tendon refl exes, notably at the ankles. However, many patients have no clinical signs of neuromuscular disease. The polyneuropathy tends to be more severe the longer that the patient is in the unit.",

Indeed, because successful treatment of the sepsis results in improvement in the polyneuropathy, we advise that all medical and surgical means of improving the sepsis and multiple organ failure be instituted. Moreover, all critical care units should use whatever methods are necessary to avoid sepsis (e.g., use of sterile techniques and avoidance of invasive procedures unless absolutely necessary). Although we have no evidence that the polyneuropathy is due to nutritional defi ciency, it seems pru dent to administer total parenteral or enteral nutrition from the start of critical illness. Those individuals responsible for physical therapy and rehabilitation should be aware of the nature and severity of the polyneuropathy, so that they will take it into account as the patient gradually recovers. 42 Intravenous immune globulin has been widely used to treat sepsis but appears to have little effect on critical illness polyneuropathy. 43, 44 Interventions to interrupt the septic cascade utilizing monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against bacterial endotoxin, oxygen radical scavengers, platelet activating factor receptor antagonists, and hemofi ltration techniques and plasma exchange have had little effect on the septic syndrome. 10 Administration of recombinant activator protein 1 to reduce intravascular thrombosis improved morbidity and mortality, but polyneuropathy was not evaluated. 2 The most interesting recent development was the well-designed study by van den Berghe and associates showing that better control of blood glucose levels utilizing insulin not only improves morbidity and mortality but also reduces the incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy. 45",

Whereas acute quadriplegic myopathy 48 has been the most common designation, others include critical care myopathy, acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care, thick fi lament myopathy, critical illness myopathy, acute corticosteroid myopathy, acute hydrocortisone myopathy, acute myopathy in severe asthma, and acute corticosteroid and pancuronium-associated myopathy. The term critical illness myopathy is now considered the most appropriate description for this syndrome. 49 By defi nition, patients are or were critically ill, and weakness should have started after the onset of critical illness. Critical illness myopathy may occur independently of, or in association with, critical illness polyneuropathy. De Letter and co-workers showed a relationship between the early onset and severity of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy and Apache III scores, which measure the severity of critical illness and sepsis. 50 Critical illness myopathy develops in at least one third of ICU patients treated for status asthmaticus, 51 in 7 percent of patients after orthoptic liver transplantation, 52 and in patients after heart transplant. 53 It may occur in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), even though there is no evidence of virus on culture and electron microscopy. 54 In a prospective study by Trojaborg and colleagues, 55 all 22 critically ill patients showed clinical, electrophysiological, and muscle biopsy evidence of a primary myopathy.",

Park and co-workers observed this prolongation in every muscle tested in patients with critical illness myopathy. 57 The sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPS) should be normal but may be reduced in amplitude owing to tissue edema. Near-nerve recordings overcome this diffi culty. Examination of motor unit potentials may be impaired by the attendant septic encephalopathy and sedation. This diffi culty may be partially overcome by recording from the tibialis anterior muscle and activating motor units by plantar stimulation. Fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves will be present in both critical illness myopathy and neuropathy. In critical illness myopathy, motor unit potentials are of low amplitude and short duration, with high-frequency components. Quantitative studies of motor unit potentials confi rm that their duration is decreased. 55 However, such units are also seen in criti -cal illness polyneuropathy with predominantly distal motor axonopathy, as demonstrated in single-fi ber studies. 58 Electrical inexcitability of the muscle membrane can be demonstrated by direct needle stimulation of the muscle 59 in patients with severe critical illness myopathy and markedly reduced or absent CMAPs. 60 In critical illness polyneuropathy, there is a response to direct muscle stimulation but not to stimulation of the nerve supplying the muscle. Direct muscle stimulation may therefore be helpful in the differentiation of these two disorders. 61, 62 However, the results of direct muscle stimulation are only semiquantitative, and this, coupled with the coexistence of critical illness neuropathy and myopathy, may make interpretation diffi cult. Trojaborg has proposed an electrophysiological approach using the methods noted, plus motor unit estimate techniques. 63 A more consistent and easily measured response is the duration of the CMAP, which is increased in duration in a manner consistent with a primary myopathy ( Fig. 52-4 ).",

The techniques can indicate impairment of \"central drive\" as a dis turbance of the voluntary or automatic centers of respiration, or impairment of phrenic nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscle. For example, in patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, the degree of invo lvement of the phrenic nerves can be determined and will supplement measurements, including of vital cap acity, in determining the need for respiratory assistance. 75 Documenting the degree of axonal degeneration or demyelination of phrenic nerves aids in long-term prognostication. In a study of 40 patients who had diffi culty in weaning from the ventilator when a neuromuscular cause was suspected, 38 were shown to have such a disorder. 76 In an earlier study, Spitzer and associates also found a high incidence of both polyneuropathy and myopathy as causes of prolonged diffi culty in weaning. 77 Most had critical illness polyneuropathy, but there were varying combinations of unilateral phrenic nerve damage, neuromuscular transmission defects, and primary myopathies. Combined electrophysiological studies of limbs and the respiratory system are therefore of assistance in identifying these conditions and rendering a prognosis.",
