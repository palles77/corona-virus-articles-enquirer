Reducing and/or a!kylating reagents did not affect VSV hemagglutination and the impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, did not significantly influence VSV infectivity. These data indicate that glycoprotein spikes are not the major sites for the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents. [\"C]Iodoacetic acid was able to penetrate the virion membrane to bind covalently to the free sulfhydryl groups of all five virion proteins, particularly the reduced disulfides of the L protein. The RNA polymerase activity of intact VSV was inhibited by iodoacetic acid and to a greater extent by N-ethylmaleimide, which probably accounts for the loss of viral infectivity caused by the permeable sulfhydryl reagents.",

It was found that a number of sulfhydryl binding reagents reduced the infectivity of various picornaviruses. A sulfhydryl reagent was also found to inactivate hemagglutination by a wide variety of enveloped viruses (Philipson and Choppin, 1960) as well as the infectivity of influenza virus although adsorption was not affected (Choppin and Philipson, 1961) . Sulfhydryl reagents also lowered the infectivity of paramyxoviruses Choppin, 1974, 1977) .

Several, if not all, of the five VSV proteins appear to have free sulfhydryl groups which can be oxidized to crosslink proteins by forming disulfide bonds (Dubovi and Wagner, 1977) . We first focused our attention on the single surface glycoprotein of VSV because of its obvious role in the initiation of infection (Bishop et al., 1977) and as the major antigenic determinant (Kelley et al., 1972) . Moreover, Kelley and Emerson (unpublished data) have uncovered evidence that three disulfide bridges contribute to the secondary structure of the VSV glycoprotein, thus making it a likely candidate for the effect of reducing and alkylating reagents. We soon discovered that SH groups of other VSV proteins appear to make more significant contributions to the biological activity of VSV.",

Therefore, purified intact VSV was exposed to varying concentrations of SH-blocking reagents IAA or NEM, with or without prior exposure to 2-ME. After removal of excess reagents by centrifugation, control and treated virus was disrupted in Tritonhigh salt solubilizer and polymerase activity was assayed by incorporation of [3H]uridine into acid-precipitable RNA (Emerson and Wagner, 1973) .

Purified intact virus was incubated for 30 min at 25\" with buffer (controls) or with various concentrations of each of the reagents. Unreaeted reagents were removed by pelleting the virus by centrifugation through a 50% glycerol cushion.

The results are expressed as percentage of the control polymerase reactions in the absence of inhibitory reagents. sively inhibited by exposure to increasing concentrations of IAA and drastically inhibited by very small amounts of NEM. The effect of IAA on transcription was greater when intact virions were previously exposed to 2-ME, reaching ~10% of the control level of RNA synthesis at 20-25 mM IAA ( Fig. 2A) . As expected, prior exposure to 2-ME alone had no effect on VSV transcription ( Fig. 2A) . In sharp contrast, 50 pmol of NEM reduced VSV transcriptase activity at least 96%, regardless of whether 2-ME was present (Fig. 2B) . These results indicate that sulfhydryl reagents inactivate transcriptase activity of intact VSV to varying degrees, potentially accounting for their capacity to reduce infectivity to a corresponding degree. Of considerable interest was the finding that the nonpenetrating sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, had no capacity to reduce the transcriptase activity of intact VSV; however, 100 pmol of dextran maleimide inhibited in vitro RNA synthesis of T&on-disrupted VSV by 99% (data not shown).",

Evidence that sulfhydryl reagents can affeet capsid proteins or glycoproteins of enveloped virus was largely based on inhibition of hemagglutination by picornaviruses (Philipson and Choppin, 1962) , paramyxoviruses (Scheid and Choppin, 1974) , coronavirus (Pocock, 1978) , and measles virus (Hardwick and Bussell, 1978) . Our experiments reveal that potent sulfhydryl reagents have no effect on the hemagglutinating activity of vesicular stomatitis virus even though the free sulfhydryl groups and reduced disulfides of VSV glycoprotein are effectively blocked. Sulfhydryl reagents capable of penetrating the VSV membrane and reacting with internal proteins quite effectively impaired viral infectivity regardless of whether protein disulfide bonds were reduced. Con-versely, the impermeant bulky reagent, dextran-malemide, had no effect on the infectivity of VSV. The permeable sulfhydryl reagents, iodoacetic acid and Nethyl-maleimide, inhibited the RNA polymerase of intact VSV, whereas dextranmaleimide did not unless the virion membrane was disrupted with Triton X-100. These data suggest that sulfhydryl reagents will inactivate the infectivity of intact VSV only if they are capable of penetrating the membrane and attack the endogenous RNA polymerase of the virion.",

It can be seen that [14C]iodoacetic acid penetrated the envelope of intact VSV and readily labeled free SH groups of all submembranous proteins, particularly M and N, even in the unreduced state. The presence of the reducing agent, 2-ME, resulted in greatly enhanced labeling by [14C]iodoacetic acid of VSV proteins M, NComparative electropherograms of proteins extracted from intact VSV that had been incubated with [Wliodoacetic acid (ZOO mCi/mmol) (IAA) alone (solid line) or with [\"C]IAA after prior reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol (dashed line).
