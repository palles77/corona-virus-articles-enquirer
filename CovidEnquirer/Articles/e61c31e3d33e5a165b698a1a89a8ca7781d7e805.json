During purification, in-process samples were used to characterize protein 202 purity (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). The binding capacity of each chromatographic step was also determined, as this 203 information will facilitate upscaling the process. The low purity of PpSP15 (64.6%) in the FS as determined by 204 densitometry (Figure 1b and Table 1 ) was likely due to heavy contamination with host cell impurities or 205 degraded PpSP15 (Figure 1a, lane 1) .

When SPXL pool containing only 75 mg of PpSP15 was loaded, no or 221 very little of PpSP15 was observed in the wash step (Supplementary Figure S2c) . Thus, binding capacity was 222 reported as remaining PpSP15 after the wash step per unit volume of PS6FF resin, i.e., 75 mg/5 mL PS6FF resin 223 or 15 mg/mL PS6FF at a flow rate of 25.6 cm/hr with a residence time of 5.8 minutes. After the PS6FF run, the 224 purity of the product increased to 97.2%, and 91% of target protein was recovered from the IEX step, which led to 225 a high overall process recovery rate of 79%. Bis-tris gel (Supplementary Figure S3) . However, when more than 2 \u00b5g were loaded, a faint band at 233 approximately 4.5-5 kDa was observed under reduced conditions and a light smear at approximately 6-14 kDa 234 under non-reduced conditions. The two distinct bands observed on the overloaded gel (Supplementary Figure S3) were recovered, trypsin-digested and analyzed by proteomic mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the 236 17 kDa protein band contained 99.9% PpSP15 while the 4.5 kDa band contained approximately 52.5% of 237 degraded PpSP15 and 47.5% of HCP (Table S2) . On the silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel, a similar profile was 238 obtained: when more than one \u00b5g of purified PpSP15 was loaded, small molecular weight impurities were 239 observed (Figure 2b ), but no aggregation or dimer formation was observed. DLS indicated the size of PpSP15 240 was approximately 17 kDa, which was consistent with the data shown by SDS-PAGE. The low polydispersity (< 241 8%) further indicated that the protein was monodispersed (Figure 2c ). To further assess the level of any potential 242 aggregation, SE-HPLC was also employed. The results (Figure 2d ) indicated that PpSP15 eluted as a single peak 243 at 20.8 minutes, slightly later than the retention time of the 17kDa protein standard (20.0 minutes) from a well-244 resolved Bio-Rad gel filtration standard, suggesting the size of PpSP15 was likely slightly less than 17kDa. No 245 detectable peak eluted prior to 20.8 minutes again demonstrated that PpSP15 was likely not aggregated. 246",

The PpSP15 antisera were able to 249 recognize the protein band at approximately 16 kDa, thus confirming the identity as PpSP15, of which the 250 theoretical molecular weight was 14.75 kDa. However, the proteomic mass spectrometric data indicated that small 251 molecular weight impurities containing degraded PpSP15 and HCPs were present and that these were not 252 recognized by either PpSP15-specific antisera or P. pastoris X33 HCP specific antibodies, suggesting that the 253 impurities could be low in quantity and required a higher concentration of detection antibodies or that they were 254 not antigenic. 255 256 Structure Assessment using Circular Dichroism. Far-UV Circular dichroism (CD) was performed to investigate 257 the secondary structure of PpSP15. The result indicates that the yeast expressed PpSP15 was rich in alpha-helices 258 (62.6% alpha-helix, 7.5% beta-sheet and 12.7% turn/loop) (Figure 4a) . The thermal stability of its secondary 259 structure was evaluated by heating the sample from 25\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C (Figures 4b, 4c, and 4d ) and the CD melting 260 curves were further extracted at 197 nm, 210 nm and 220 nm (Figures 4c and 4d) since these wavelengths showed the best signal to noise data. Based on the derivative, the onset of structural changes begins at 262 approximately 40\u00b0C (T on1 ) and the average melting temperature (T m1 ) was found to be 55\u00b0C for all three 263 wavelengths (Figures 4c and 4d) . 264 265 Buffer screening using thermal shift assay. pH screening (ranging from pH 3.1 to pH 9.0) for PpSP15 was 266 performed by evaluating the thermal stability of its tertiary structure using thermal shift assays (Figure 5) . Based 267 on the derivative (Figure 5b) , the onset temperature T on for PpSP15 at pH 3.1 could not be determined as it was 268 lower than 25 \u00b0C and the melting temperature T m was approximately 49 \u00b0C, suggesting PpSP15 may denature at 269 room temperature at this pH. When pH increased to between 4.4 and 9.0, T on increased to approximately 45\u00b0C. 270",

SDS-332 PAGE gels and the mass spectrometry also indicated the absence of N-glycans. Other more sensitive and specific 333 assays were also applied to study the purity/impurity, including silver-stained SDS-PAGE and anti-PpSP15 334 western blot and anti-P. pastoris X33 HCP western blot. The results suggested that only trace amounts of HCP 335 and product-derived impurities, degraded PpSP15, were present in the purified PpSP15 sample. Moreover, no 336 detectable aggregation was found, which was also supported by DLS and SE-HPLC. Indeed, its low binding 337 affinity to the HIC column explaining this protein is likely highly hydrophilic. Additionally, when comparing the 338 six cysteine residues in PpSP15 form disulfide bridges, and thus, no free cysteine residue should be present to 340 form intermolecular disulfide bridges. These findings suggest a low tendency for PpSP15 to aggregate, a desirable 341 property for long-term stability. The secondary structure analyzed by far-UV CD indicated PpSP15 as a highly 342 alpha-helical protein (62.6% alpha-helix and 7.5% beta-sheet). This result was consistent with the secondary 343 structure of its homolog, PdSP15 (PDB ID 4OZD), (66% helix), which further validated the assay. Finally, pH 344 screening using a thermal shift assay was conducted to determine the proper pH system to maintain PpSP15 345 stability. It is noted that the onset temperature and melting temperature remained constant between pH 4.4-9.0; 346 however, a lower melting temperature was observed at both pH 3.1 and 3.7, suggesting instability of PpSP15, 347 which further indicates buffer formulations at a pH lower than 4.4 should be avoided. 348",
