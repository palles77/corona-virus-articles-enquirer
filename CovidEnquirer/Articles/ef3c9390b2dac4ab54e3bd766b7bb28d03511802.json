However, studies on the role of these viruses in asthmatic patients in the interval between exacerbations are sparse. This study aimed to determine the presence of respiratory viruses, without symptoms of infection, in the airways of young asthmatics as compared to healthy controls. Material and Methods: Patients 10e35 years of age with stable asthma and a group of healthy controls were analyzed regarding the presence of RNA from common respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates by PCR. Self-reported asthma control and quality of life, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), spirometry, and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were recorded. Blood samples were collected to assess IgE sensitisation and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels. Results: In 354 patients with asthma and 108 healthy controls, human rhinovirus (HRV) was the only virus detected (4.5% of asthmatics vs. 0.9% of controls; p \u00bc 0.08). HRV \u00fe asthma patients had a higher degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation (median 37.7 vs. 10.4 kU A /L, p \u00bc 0.04), and a tendency for higher levels of serum ECP (median 17.2 vs. 12.6 mg/L, p \u00bc 0.07), as compared to their HRV \u00c0 counterparts.",

However, regarding the role of respiratory viruses in asthmatic patients during stable periods between exacerbations, very little data is available. It has been speculated that human rhinovirus (HRV) has the ability to cause persistent infections in patients with asthma, but only a few small studies have suggested a preponderance of respiratory viruses in nonexacerbating asthmatic individuals compared to healthy controls [6, 7] . Viral load and clinical deterioration during acute HRV infections have been shown to be related to reduced interferon response and increased type 2-cytokine (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13) response in patients with asthma compared to non-asthmatic controls [8, 9] . Further, human airway epithelial cells produce the proinflammatory molecule C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) in relation to HRV infection [10] , and this response appears to be specific to viral-induced acute asthma [11] . Moreover, Th2 cytokines increase the release of CXCL10 in the presence of rhinovirus infection [12] . Thus, type-2 inflammation in the airways could possibly facilitate viral replication over prolonged periods or, vice versa, the infection could promote chronic airway inflammation.",

Further, S-ECP showed a statistical trend towards elevated levels in HRV \u00fe subjects (17.2 vs 12.6 mg/L, p \u00bc 0.07), whereas blood eosinophil count did not differ between groups (Tables 3 and 4 ).

When analysing the differential cell count (percentage of total leukocyte count), all comparisons were non-significant (p > 0.10). Interestingly, HRV \u00fe asthmatics were characterised by a more than 3-fold greater degree of IgE sensitisation against aeroallergens compared to HRV \u00c0 patients (37.7 vs 10.4 kU/L, p \u00bc 0.04; Table 3 ). These results were confirmed when only atopic asthmatics (n \u00bc 281) were included in the analysis: 49.5 (IQR 13.5e79.5) kU/L in HRV \u00fe (n \u00bc 14) vs 16.9 (IQR 5.1e45.5) kU/L in HRV \u00c0 subjects (n \u00bc 267; p \u00bc 0.04). The degree of IgE sensitisation against food allergens and total IgE did not differ between groups (Table 3) . In a multiple logistic regression model including all subjects with asthma, the association between the degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation and HRV positivity was consistent (p \u00bc 0.03) after adjustment for age, sex, height, weight, FEV 1 % and current smoking. Higher age (p \u00bc 0.01) was also a significant determinant in this model. A similar analysis in subjects with atopic asthma yielded similar results with the degree of IgE sensitisation against aeroallergens (p \u00bc 0.04), higher age (p \u00bc 0.01) and male sex (p \u00bc 0.03) being significant.",

Although the prevalence of HRV was higher in the asthmatic patients in our study the difference only showed a trend towards statistical significance. However, a slightly larger proportion of the asthmatic subjects were examined outside the common cold season, which may have reduced the chance of finding HRV in asthmatics relative to controls. Furthermore, the difference in HRV prevalence between the groups was seen in spite of the fact that a significantly larger proportion of control subjects than asthmatics were smokers, a factor that may increase susceptibility to HRV infections [23, 24] . Accordingly, there was a trend towards higher prevalence of smokers in HRV \u00fe asthmatics versus HRV \u00c0 asthmatics in our study. Cigarette smoke has been shown to down-regulate bronchial epithelial release of antiviral proteins, for example CXCL10, in response to rhinovirus infection [25, 26] , via the inhibition of multiple transcriptional pathways linked to innate immune responses [27] . Wos and colleagues have previously demonstrated that HRV can be detected in the lower respiratory tract of asthmatic patients more frequently than in healthy controls, in the absence of recent asthma exacerbations or signs of common cold [7] . However, the asthmatic subjects in their study had undergone bronchoscopy on clinical indications, and were thus not representative of a general asthma population. A small study in schoolchildren during symptom-free periods indicated greater prevalence of HRV in asthmatics compared to control children, but a statistical comparison between groups was not presented and time of the year for sampling was not described [6] . In contrast, a recent relatively large study showed similar prevalence of HRV in children with stable asthma and healthy controls [28] .",

Our cross-sectional study design prevent analysis of the presence of chronic HRV infection and shedding among asthmatics, but one could speculate that if true, the prevalence of detectable HRV should have been higher as well as more evenly distributed over seasons. Furthermore, Jartti et al. recently showed that infants with prolonged or recurrent respiratory illnesses most often had a series of infections rather than a persistent infection with one virus strain [30] .

The frequency of HRV infections is rather high in pre-school children, but decreases with age [34] . Parents of young children, however, seem to catch their colds primarily at home, and a hiatus in the decrease of HRV frequency has been observed in the age interval 20e29 years [35] , coinciding with the time when people commonly establish a family. This could possibly explain why we found the median age of the HRV \u00c0 asthmatic patients to be 19 years, whereas for the HRV \u00fe patients it was 26 years. The lack of detectable viral RNA from RSV, influenza A and B, and hCoV is consistent with two other studies on asymptomatic asthmatic individuals [6, 28] , and our data further support the unique relationship between asthma and susceptibility to HRV infections.",

Exhaled NO signals local type-2 cytokine activity in the airways, and mean FeNO was increased in HRV \u00fe asthmatics but this did not reach significance. However, it must be noted that most of the asthmatics in our study used inhaled corticosteroids, and FeNO is most often rapidly reduced by this treatment [37] , whereas restoration of viral host defence may be a slower process. Exhaled NO is also increased by HRV infections, but the increase is seen only for a few days after acute infection and should thus not have influenced our results [38, 39] .",

Instead, a trend towards increased numbers of blood neutrophils and monocytes was seen in HRV \u00fe subjects. Previous studies have shown increased neutrophil counts in induced sputum by virus infections in both asthmatics and controls [40] . Jarjour et al. have shown an increase in B-Eos differential count acutely after HRV inoculation in patients with atopic asthma [41] . Further, Wos et al. have presented increased B-Eos count in atopic asthmatics with asymptomatic HRV positivity in the lower airways [7] . One study showed increased S-ECP acutely after HRV exposure in patients with atopic asthma and high IgE concentrations [42] . Elevated S-ECP, but not B-Eos count, have been associated with acute virusinduced exacerbations in children [43, 44] . This indicates that S-ECP may be a more sensitive marker of HRV-induced systemic eosinophilic activation than B-Eos count. Plasma levels of CXCL10 have previously been shown to be increased in acute asthma, presumably related to HRV infections, whereas CXCL10 was not elevated in stable asthma [43] . We could not detect any increase in plasma CXCL10 levels in the asymptomatic HRV \u00fe asthmatics in our study, indicating a low rate of virus replication in these subjects.",

Thus, our data do not allow us to determine whether the increased prevalence of subclinical HRV infections in asthmatics relates to increased frequency of acute infections or a slower elimination of virus after an acute infection. Further, self-reporting of symptoms increases the risk of bias and we may have sampled individuals during the incubation phase of an acute HRV infection. However, the incubation time is very short for HRV, shorter than for other respiratory viruses, suggesting that this risk should be low [45] . Another potential limitation is that we did not diagnose which HRV species the patients were infected with, but regarding HRV positivity and its effect on levels of FeNO, a recent report showed no differences between HRV species [28] . Also, the cross-sectional study did not allow for prospectively assessing upcoming asthma exacerbations.",

The prevalence of HRV tended to be increased in adolescents and young adults with asthma compared to age-matched controls. The presence of HRV in asthmatics was significantly associated with the degree of IgE sensitisation against aeroallergens and weakly to S-ECP levels. Our data suggest that HRV infections are more common, and/or cleared at a slower rate, in asthmatics with signs of high degree of type-2driven disease compared to healthy controls, and the difference seems to be related to presence of systemic eosinophilic inflammation despite inhaled corticosteroid treatment.",
