This prompted us to review our recent experience in adult patients with influenza A. During the last influenza season, 10 adults were admitted to the hospital. We reviewed their complete blood counts to determine the incidence of leukopenia and lymphopenia (absolute/relative).

The author reported absolute lymphopenia was present in 4 of 9 children (44%) and 6 of 8 adults (75%) in his series (Table 1) . This winter, 10 adults were hospitalized with influenza A, and 10 of 10 (100%) had relative lymphopenia, and 9 of 10 (90%) had severe relative lymphopenia (\u03fd10% lymphocytes) ( Table 2 ). Lymphocyte counts did not correlate with leukopenia or thrombocytopenia in our patients, but profound relative lymphopenia was a constant finding with adult influenza A. In our patients, severe relative lymphopenia was the most characteristic laboratory feature of influenza A ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "Lymphopenia is not a universal finding in acute viral infections. Lymphopenia occurs in a variety of noninfectious disorders, such as, severe combined immunodeficiency disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, myasthenia gravis, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Lymphopenia may also result from ethyl alcohol dependency, steroids, antilymphocytic globulin, and radiation/chemotherapy. Only certain infectious diseases such as malaria, babesiosis, miliary tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, measles, histoplasmosis, brucellosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, and septic shock are associated with lymphopenia. Lymphopenia is important diagnostically and prognostically in West Nile encephalitis, measles, and human immunodeficiency virus. [1] [2] [3] [4] In the past we have noted the lack of atypical lymphocytes in influenza A, and this observation was again noted in our recent influenza A experience. Atypical lymphocytes occur with relatively few viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus-6, as well as some nonviral infections such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, babesiosis, and noninfectious disorders (ie, drug fevers). Atypical lymphocytes are not a laboratory feature of influenza A in adults. 3, 4 We conclude that in adults with acute influenza-like illnesses, the degree and duration of severe relative/absolute lymphopenia can differentiate influenza A from influenzalike illness. In our recent experience, the degree and duration of relative lymphopenia in adult patients with influenza A are predictive of severe infection, that is, all patients required hospitalization. Because early severe relative lymphopenia is a characteristic laboratory finding in influenza A, the diagnosis of influenza A should be questioned in patients who do not have early and severe relative/absolute lymphopenia. 5 Lymphopenia is a constant finding and is more common in influenza A than leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis in the patients with viral influenza should suggest a secondary bacterial pneumonia. Leukopenia has been described as a cardinal laboratory finding in influenza A but is not mentioned in major infectious disease textbooks. [6] [7] [8] With respect to the authors' reported finding of eosinopenia, we offer a word of caution. The complete blood counts were performed using automated cell counters, which are relatively insensitive to atypical lymphocytes and eosinophils, and their findings of eosinopenia may be related to an automated cell counting technique. 4 The cell counts reported in our series were performed manually, and no eosinophils or atypical lymphocytes were present in our patients.",
