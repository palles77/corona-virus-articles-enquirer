We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species-and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.",

            "text": "There are many different methods that characterize the mixture of organisms present within a metagenomic dataset. Such datasets are generated when a complex environmental sample is processed by a \"next-generation\" high-throughput genome sequencing protocol, and they consist of large numbers of short nucleotide sequences. Each sequence represents a small fragment of a randomly selected genome from the very large collection of genomes present in the source sample. Those sequences indicate the presence of one organism or another according to their similarity to a set of known reference genomes. While a given sequence may be unique to one species, it also may be found in diverse organisms across the tree of life. Therefore, one analytical challenge (among many) is to take that collection of sequences (likely numbering in the millions) and accurately determine what species are present in the sample. Here we describe a novel method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) that is specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of targeted organisms from a metagenomic dataset by aligning reads to genomic regions that are unique at the strain or species level.",

For example, the function of the human gut microbiome may depend on the relative abundance of hundreds of species of bacteria and the types of metabolic genes they contain (Wu, et al., 2011; Schloissnig, et al., 2013) . In contrast, the clinical treatment of a patient may depend on whether or not a particular virus, or a consortium of co-infecting pathogens, is/are detected in their blood. It is this second class of presence/absence questions that SIANN is designed to address. SIANN is appropriate for situations in which a user wants to know whether a particular organism or set of organisms is present in a sample, but isn't interested in the functions encoded in their genomes, the relative abundance of each organism, or any other more in-depth analysis.",

They generally require reference databases that are very large and/or require a large amount of processing to generate. The gap SIANN is designed to fill is when the entire tree of life is irrelevant, and only predefined subsets of organisms need to be detected. For an underlying method we chose read alignment to diagnostic genomic regions because the algorithms for read alignment are highly parallelizable and have been optimized heavily by the community at large (the current implementation of SIANN uses bowtie2 [Langmead & Salzberg, 2012] for the alignment function, but can be adapted to any alignment algorithm). This approach is distinct from using cladespecific marker genes (Segata, et al., 2012) because unique regions that are larger, smaller, or outside of genes can also be used. Furthermore, this approach supports the rapid construction of custom databases using reference genome sets that require only minimal user-supplied structure.",

If Species II were not present in the example shown in Figure 1b , a much larger number of reads would be assigned as \"species-specific,\" when in fact those regions are shared with other species. Therefore, the ability of this method to identify strain-and species-specific sequences is a direct function of the inclusion of near neighbors in the reference database. This characteristic is shared among many classification algorithms, but it is of particular note for this method when users have an opportunity to construct their own database.. In order to detect a target species with a high degree of specificity (reducing false positives), it is necessary to include other related species in the reference database. Only by parallel alignment to those near neighbors can the redundant sequences be separated from the species-specific ones. For example, in order to detect Bacillus anthracis in a sample, it would be necessary to include other species of Bacilli in the reference database so that the presence of B. cereus or B. thuringiensis in a sample does not lead to a false call for B. anthracis.",

            "text": "The nomenclature of genus, species, and strain is potentially problematic because it does not correspond to a consistent degree of evolutionary distance or genomic distinctiveness. The ability to distinguish two organisms by any method using genomic sequence data is proportional to the amount of each genome that is shared or unique. One might assume that any two organisms of the same species will have a relatively predictable amount of shared genomic identity. However, some pairs of organisms from the same species may have less in common than other pairs of organisms from different species or even genera. This ambiguity impacts SIANN in two ways. If two organisms have very little genomic sequence to distinguish them, the sensitivity of SIANN to detect either one will diminish (the rate of false negatives will increase as the likelihood of sequencing unique regions decreases). Conversely, if an organism is extremely dissimilar to the near neighbors selected for the database, the specificity with which SIANN detects that organism will decline (the rate of false positives will increase as the number of related genomes available in the database decreases). For example, if a database contained only E. coli and B.anthracis, a sample containing B. cereus would be misidentified as contraining B. anthracis. In the intended use case, a database targeting B. anthracis would contain B. cereus and a number of other near neighbors to prevent that kind of misidentification. It would be convenient to say that an ideal database can be made by calculating the ideal genetic distance between all references and then finding an ideal set of organisms to make up that database, but the behavior of any database will be governed by the particular genomes of the organisms it encounters in the wild. Because not all organisms evolve in the same manner (differences in mutation rate, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, etc), the suitability of a database and method to detect a given organism can only be determined by thorough validation and benchmarking, as well as updating the reference database as needed. Users of SIANN may construct their own custom databases to include newly identified genomes or specific subsets of genomes that best suit their research interests.",

Kraken and LMAT both count the reads assigned to each taxon, MetaPhlAn calculates the abundance, and SIANN outputs a measure of the proportion of diagnostic genomic regions present. To put these measures on an even footing, we empirically calculated the false positive rate for each method over all 600 samples, at each possible measure of output. Because each dataset is made up of known organisms, any result can be classified as true or false. Therefore, for any possible result (say, 513 reads classified by LMAT or 1.6% abundance assigned by MetaPhlAn), one can calculate the proportion of calls with at least the same amount of support that were correct (True Positives/[True Positives+False Positives]), over all of the 600 datasets. That measure is commonly given as Positive Predictive Value (PPV). For each program, the results can be translated from the raw value into a PPV that is based on this empirical measure of error. The key item of interest is the PPV value for the results that we know to be true positives, the defined spike organisms. Another way of describing this approach is to say that the results of each program have been normalized to the false positive error rate that was empirically observed. If another set of samples were generated, the PPV vs. raw value curve ( Figure 2 ) would likely fall differently, but in this case it gives us a means of comparing a diverse set of methods against the same ground truth. If method 1 detects an organism with a higher PPV than method 2 does, it means that method 1 has fewer false positives in the range that it reports true positives, which is the definition of utility in this setting.",

It is extremely unlikely that a 300bp exact match would arise due to random chance, and so the user could say with confidence that the organism of interest is found within the sequence data (not considering contamination, horizontal gene transfer, etc). However, such an approach is not currently implemented in an automated method, and many of the steps needed to make that assertion are performed manually by a domain expert, including alignment to near neighbors and ensuring that the read does not fall within a transposon, plasmid, etc. Therefore, while one could say that a single read is all that is needed to state with high PPV that an organism is present, the amount of reads assigned in an automated manner needed to achieve that level of PPV will number in the thousands (Fig 2) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/001727 doi: bioRxiv preprint The next phase of benchmarking was to determine how many raw input reads were needed to achieve the threshold for high PPV. To demonstrate this we plotted the known abundance of each spike organism against the PPV value generated by each method (Figure 3 ). Each point (an organism at a known level of abundance) is comprised of a maximum of 50 replicates, where the diameter of each point increases with an increasing number of replicates. For demonstration purposes we are showing two pairs of bacteria and three viruses. Recall that for each of the pairs of bacteria (and the two poxviruses) any sample containing one did not contain the other (as shown in Table 1 ). The empty boxes result from the organisms not being called at any abundance. For MetaPhlAn, that is a result of no viruses being included in the version of the reference database available for this analysis. Kraken assigned no reads to Hanta virus because viral RNA genomes were not included in this version of the reference database (personal communication with D. Wood). This emphasizes the point that a) the ability to create custom databases targeting organisms of interest can be valuable, and b) the performance of any method must be benchmarked against each potential target of interest.",

The results presented here show that SIANN rapidly detects the presence of a given set of organisms with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. For example, at the 95% confidence (PPV) cutoff of 0.2, SIANN reliably detects all of the organisms tested here at as low as 0.3% abundance. This strong performance is likely due to the fact that SIANN is able to use a method (read alignment to whole genomes) that would be far too computationally costly if it were applied to the entire collection of known genomes. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.
