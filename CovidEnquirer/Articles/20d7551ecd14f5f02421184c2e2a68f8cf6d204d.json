            "text": "as a complex clinical picture. If the virus infects the foetus during the process of organogenesis, in the first 3-4 months of pregnancy, then it is extremely likely that the infant will be born with gross defects. Nevertheless, some infants escape developmental defects but show other signs of infection, such as low birth weight or hepatosplenomegaly. The virus often persists in foetal tissues throughout gestation and can be recovered from the infant after birth (Menser et al., 1967 , Monif et al., 1965 . In the latter group, virus can be easily isolated from the throat, csf, urine and faeces and liver for up to 3 months after birth. These rubella syndrome children can, therefore, be an important infectious source for pregnant women. Prospective studies have established that when a mother is infected in the first 4 weeks of pregnancy a minimal figure of 60% of the infants have congenital defects, but other authorities would suggest a higher figure, approaching 90%. The incidence of congenital defects (principally deafness) resulting from intrauterine infection in the first 4 months of pregnancy has been estimated at between 1.5 and 50% (reviewed by Banatvala and Best, 1984) . It should also be remembered that rubella infection of the mother may result in spontaneous abortion in up to 20% of cases, usually when the infection occurs in the first eight weeks.",

            "text": "Rubella virus is a positive-stranded RNA virus, 40-70 nm in diameter with a lipoprotein envelope. It has been classified as a non-arthropod-borne togavirus and has been placed by itself in the genus Rubivirus. No antigenic relationship has been shown, for example, between rubella and more than 200 alpha and flaviviruses, and no cross reactions are detected with pestiviruses or equine arteritis virus (Brinton, 1980) . The nucleocapsid is 30-40 nm in diameter and contains a single molecule of RNA which is infectious when extracted under appropriate conditions. The viral envelope is acquired by budding from the host cell. The pleomorphic character of the virus particle is presumably due to the non-rigid character of the lipid envelope; elliptical and oblong virus particles and particles bearing finger-like protrusions have been described ( Fig. 9 .1). The envelope bears poorly defined 5-6 nm surface spikes, presumably composed of viral glycoproteins, which carry the pH-dependent HA activity. At least four (see below) major polypeptides have been described, three glycoproteins associated with the envelope (E 1, E2a and E2b), and a non-glycosylated core protein (C) which may represent viral structural proteins, precursor polypeptides, or host proteins which have remained associated with the purified virus (Oker-Blom et al., 1983 , Alstyne et al., 1981 Table 9 .2). The three glycoproteins have approximate molecular weights of 58K, 47K, and 42K respectively, whilst the molecular weight of the C protein is 37K. This would imply that the structural genes should have a coding capacity of 116K. Subgenomic 24s RNA species have been detected in virus infected cells (Oker-Blom et al., 1983) and, thus, rubella may be similar in this regard to the alphaviruses where a 26s mRNA encodes the 130K precursor of the structural proteins. It is quite likely that only three genes are required to code for the virus proteins, since E2a and E2b are very similar in their tryptic maps.",

Christie (1980) summarizes it as a trifling ailment causing less inconvenience to the patient than the common cold. In as many cases again no rash is apparent at all and a subclinical infection proceeds silently. Regardless of the severity of rubella in the adult, the foetus can be infected, resulting in congenital infection. The incubation period for rubella is 14-16 days. The rash first appears on the face around the mouth and behind the ears. On the trunk, spots are at first discrete, about the size of a pin head. If the rash progresses then it spreads rapidly to cover the arms and legs as well. Another tendency with a rubella rash is for it to come and go in an hour or so. Persons are most infectious for a few days before the rash appears and transmission is by virus aerosol and inhalation to the upper respiratory tract.",

However, nearly two decades later the enthusiastic and high expectancies of those early days (Meyer et al., 1969 , Weibel et al., 1969 have not been achieved, at least in many countries (reviewed by Banatvala, 1977 , Clarke et a]., 1979 , Grenstein and Greares, 1982 .

For example, virus was passaged 77 times in vervet monkey kidney cells (HVP-77 vaccine) , 1968 and 5 times in duck embryo fibroblasts DE5) and was found to be attenuated successfully for children and adults (Buynack et al., 1968 . Another strain of virus was passaged 5 1 times in primary rabbit kidney cells (Cendehill vaccine, Huygelen and Peetermans, 1967, Zygraich et al., 1971) , whilst a third virus was passaged 4 times in HEK and 25 times in human diploid WI-38 cells (RA 27/3, Plotkin et al., 1973) . Finally, and more recently, a Japanese vaccine virus was passaged in vervet MK cells (Table 9 .3) 7 times and 20 times in primary guinea pig kidney cells (Best et al., 1974) . All these vaccines when administered produced seroconversion in up to 95% of susceptible persons, with only limited side effects. Nevertheless, further experience indicated that the HPV-77 DK I2 vaccine produced unacceptable side effects of arthralgia and arthritis and so it was withdrawn in the USA, for example. Later the HPV 77 DE5 vaccine was also withdrawn and replaced by the RA27/3 vaccine (Meruvax 2). Side effects including arthritis and arthralgia are usually mild (Best et al., 1974) .",

After experience accumulated with the different rubella vaccines it has become clearer that side effects are more associated with some, and the longevity of immune response induced might also differ. In short, it would now appear that the RA27/3 rubella vaccine strain has more positive features than some of the other viruses, and Rubella HI antibody titre 2 months after vaccination Weibel et al.. 1975.) is currently used on a rather wide scale. Immunity induced by RA27/3 more closely resembles the immune response to naturally acquired infection. This particular virus was first isolated in 1964 from an explant of a surgically aborted foetus by direct inoculation into WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts (reviewed by Plotkin et a] ., 1973). The virus was attenuated by low temperature passage and cloning in WI-38 cells, and was used for immunization between the 27th and 30th passage in these cells. A dose is lo4 TCIDSo and can be administered intranasally or by S.C. injection (the latter technique is now favoured). In eight comparative studies performed in different countries, the mean HI antibody titre after immunization by either route was 2.4-fold higher with RA27/3 vaccine compared to Cendehill and HPV-77 vaccines (Plotkin et al., 1973) . Similarly, higher levels of neutralizing antibody were detected following RA27/3 than Cendehill vaccine (Table 9 .4) and higher levels of C F antibody than HPV-77 DE vaccine (Table 9 .5). Nasal antibody (rubella specific IgA) is regularly detected after intranasal RA27/3 vaccine and frequently detected after S.C. injection with the same vaccine. In contrast, although specific IgA antibody is detected after Cendehill and HPV-77 DE5 vaccines, for example, it does not persist so well (Best et al., 1979) (Table 9 .6). It should be noted here that there is no evidence of transmissibility from persons infected intranasally with RA27/3 vaccine. An important aspect of rubella vaccines is whether recipients could become reinfected at later dates with wild rubella virus, which could still produce teratogenic effects. In early studies of persons receiving HPV-77 or Cendehill vaccines, and who were exposed to wild virus in nature or artificially, vaccines had re-infection rates ranging from 40-100% (Table 9 .7). With RA27/3 vaccinees, re-infection rates of 3-10% were observed, which is close to figures obtained following natural infection. In a more recent study Best (personal communication) challenged a number of per- sons who had been vaccinated some 10 years earlier and viraemia was detected in 1 of 19 vaccinees who had antibody levels below 15 international units. Therefore, it is not yet known whether adequate levels of antibody will persist in all vaccinees for up to 30 years after vaccination, for example. In summary, we have a number of successful rubella vaccines, developed empirically without any knowledge of genetics of the virus or the molecular basis of virulence or attenuation. Perhaps because of this absence of precise virological knowledge it has taken 10 years of field trials to establish that the various vaccine strains are not identical and vary, for example, in their ability to produce a long lived immune response and in side effects. The RA27/3 vaccine strain would appear to be a very successful one. It will be of particular interest, though, to analyze the genome of these different viruses and hence to determine, for example, how many mutations are required to change a rubella strain from a virulent one to an attenuated one. This could lead to the artificial 'construction' of a new generation of attenuated vaccines (see Chapter 2).",

            "text": "When the vaccines were licensed in 1969, two strategies for use were discussed, but with a single aim, namely to prevent congenital rubella syndrome (RS). Widespread vaccination of adolescent girls and women would prevent RS, but would not influence virus transmission in the community. On the other hand, routine vaccination of children (boys and girls) early in life would increase herd immunity and interrupt transmission of the disease. The USA adopted the latter policy whilst the UK Symptoms lasting seven days or 0 1 (3.2%) 2 (5.6%) 2 (5.9%) 5 (3.7%) more adopted the former policy. Recent epidemiological modelling studies have shown both countries to have taken the correct decision, because when the fractions of the susceptibles vaccinated is less than 80% it is better to let natural rubella spread (e.g. U.K.), whereas in countries where high rates of immunization are likely to be achieved (e.g. USA) then a policy of eradication can be followed with vaccine given to both boys and girls (Hinman et al., 1983, Anderson and May, 1983) . In fact the latter assessment is perhaps rather diplomatic because a more severe critic would pronounce that, whilst the USA policy has at least prevented extensive outbreaks and reduced RS, the UK policy has, up to the present time, done neither. A summary of the USA experience (Schiff, 1980) has shown the following: 1. the incidence of RS has decreased significantly ( Fig. 9 .4); 2. the vaccine viruses are not teratogenic; 3 . the vaccine of choice may be RA 2713; 4. herd immunity has not stopped outbreaks, and outbreaks are occurring in unvaccinated groups e.g. young adults; 5. 20-357,; of 18-25 year old females remain susceptible. A much more vigorous campaign is therefore required even in the USA to immunize the susceptible women of child bearing age, and also to raise immunization levels in school children. Sabin (1981) again takes a rather individual viewpoint by querying whether, in fact, the small number of RS cases justifies a large scale immunization programme. In any case he speculates that a mass immunization campaign over a shorf period of time would be necessary to break the chain of virus transmission. . 1966-81.) Similarly to measles, since rubella vaccine is a live virus vaccine, it should not be given to patients whose immunity is deficient, whether as a result of disease (e.g. malignancy) or of treatment with corticosteroids, radiotherapy or cytotoxic drugs. Since rubella vaccine may be transmitted transplacentally, pregnancy is a contraindication and should be avoided for three months after vaccination. Examination of the products of conception of rubella-susceptible women vaccinated inadvertently during pregnancy has shown that rubella virus may be recovered from the placenta, kidney and bone marrow. Furthermore, histopathological studies have shown that changes in the placenta, decidua and foetal eye are similar to those occurring in naturally acquired infection. However, clinical and serological follow-up studies carried out on women in the USA, who elected to go to term after inadvertent rubella vaccination in early pregnancy, have shown that none of 277 infants delivered of mothers known to be rubella susceptible and given rubella vaccine within a period ranging from 3 months before to 3 months after conception had major malformations. Many of these infants have been followed up since, and though about 30% have serological evidence of intrauterine infection, none had defects compatible with congenital rubella. The risk of rubella-induced major malformations among infants delivered of susceptible mothers was calculated (based on a 957; confidence limit) as 3.3% -a figure similar to the risk in normal pregnancies (Table 9 .10). The United States Immunisation Practices Advisory Committee still recommends that pregnant women should not be given rubella vaccine, but now states that inadvertent vaccination should no longer be a reason to recommend termination of pregnancy routinely.

            "text": "In the first 4 years of a blood-donor study the seronegative proportion of women born before 1956 was consistently higher than that for men of the same age ( Fig.  9.6) . However, in 1980 the percentage who were seronegative of women born before 1951 was lower than that for men of the same age and for women born between 1951 and 1956. A possible explanation for this finding is that this age group included mothers who had been vaccinated at postnatal clinics after the birth of a child. Some indication of the persistence of rubella antibodies after vaccination can be obtained from the results. Women born in 1957 and 1958 would by 1976, the first year of the study, have been vaccinated up to 6 years previously, and by 1980 up to 10 years previously. If it is assumed that the differences in proportions of seronegative subjects between men and women born after 1956 were due to rubella vaccination, then the consequence of a rapid fall in the antibody due to vaccination would be that the proportion of seronegative women would tend to revert to that of men of the same age. There is no evidence that this occurred. Thus, it appears that over this 5-year period the antibody levels persisted from up to 6 1 0 years after vaccination. Other evidence has indicated that antibody can persist in the majority of vaccinees up to 16 years after vaccination (O'Shea et al., 1982) . Hambling (1980) conducted an 8-year study from 1971 to 1978 in the UK, in which 150 000 serum samples from women of child-bearing age were tested for rubella antibody; he found that the seronegative proportion among women who had been eligible for vaccination at school was lower than that among older women. Other studies have reported similar trends, (Hutchinson et al., 1982) but two studies (Clubb et al., 1981 and Gilmour et al., 1982) failed to find any effect attributable to vaccination; the numbers of serum samples tested in the latter studies were much lower than in the other studies.",

Furthermore, adolescents and young adults now account for a high proportion of all reported measles (see Chapter 8) and rubella cases, particularly in the USA, and have the greatest risk of disease. These facts are illustrated by the measles and rubella outbreaks reported in secondary schools, colleges, military installations, and places of employment in the USA. This pattern of disease transmission has led to increased efforts to vaccinate older susceptible persons. Ideally, those in need of vaccination would be identified through a sensitive, specific, readily available, and inexpensive screening technique that provides immediate information. An obvious approach is a history of previous measles and rubella infection or vaccination; however, previous reports have indicated that such information obtained from prospective vaccinees or their parents may not be an accurate predictor of susceptibility. Preblud et al. (1982) in a recent study evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of histories of past infection or vaccination and determined the costs and effectiveness of three alternative strategies for vaccinating persons susceptible to measles, rubella, or both: ( I ) vaccinating ull persons regardless of past history; (2) serologically screening all persons and vaccinating only those who were susceptible; (3) vaccinating all persons who do not have physician-documented proof of proper vaccination, past infection (measles only), or serological immunity.",

Maternal histories were statistically no more specific than cadet histories ( P > 0.06), and identified at most only two thirds of susceptible persons. While both cadet and maternal histories for either infection or vaccination were sensitive (identifying 90% to 95% of all immune subjects), a history of neither was very nonspecific (identify-ing at most 28y4 of susceptible persons). Positive histories for previous rubella infection and vaccination were associated with lower susceptibility rates than were negative histories ( P < 0.01). However, no history successfully identified all persons susceptible to rubella. While cadet and maternal histories of rubella vaccination were more specific than other histories (P < 0.01), negative histories of vaccinations still failed to identify approximately 10% of the subjects susceptible to rubella. Comparison of discordant responses confirmed that maternal histories were generally no more reliable than cadet histories! The costs and effectiveness of the three alternative vaccination strategies in a model cohort of 1000 subjects were investigated. Vaccination of all persons is the least expensive strategy (both in total cost and cost per susceptible person protected), unless records are available for 75% or more of the population in question, in which case vaccination after record review is less expensive. However, vaccination after record review is associated with a lower proportion of protected susceptible persons compared with the other two strategies, when 75% or more of the potential vaccinees have records (approximately 80% protected vs. 90%). These findings are not altered even if one assumes that records are only 80% accurate or that they are 100% accurate. In general, while there is little difference in the total cost of administering either measles or rubella vaccine alone or both in combination, the cost per susceptible person protected indicates that a combined measles and rubella vaccination programme is highly economical.

I .8. PREVENTION OF RUBELLA USING IMMUNE GLOBULIN Normal immune globulin may prolong the incubation period considerably but since inapparent infection is accompanied by viraemia, foetal damage is not prevented (Forrest and Honeyman, 1973, Polakoff, 1983) . However, Peckham (1974) showed that infants of mothers given normal human immune globulin who experienced subclinical rubella in early pregnancy were less likely to be infected in utero than those infants whose mothers were not given immune globulin. I t is therefore possible that the administration of normal human globulin reduces the level of foetal infection, damage, or both.",

Thus, Oxford and Schild (1965) described the inhibitory effects of amantadine on microplaque formation by several strains of rubella virus (Fig. 9.7 and Table 9 .1 I). Amantadine at 100 pg/ml exerted some toxic effects in the line of rabbit kidney cells used (RK-13), whereas 20 pg/ml amantadine was required to inhibit microplaque formation by 90% -the therapeutic index therefore was low, particularly compared to the in vitro activity against strains of influenza A virus (see Chapter 7). Amantadine was also active as an antiviral in organ cultures of ferret trachea infected with rubella virus strains (Figs. 9.8 and 9.9) but no antiviral effect was noted in prophylactic experiments in laboratory animals ( Table 9 .1 1) infected intranasally with rubella virus and given relatively high dosages of the compound (5&100 mg/kg).",

One is the number of different strains and their antigenic diversity and the other the relative importance of antibodies in serum and in the intestinal fluid. The results of Kapikian et al.

The presence of local neutralizing antibodies in the intestinal fluid has been shown by Davidson et al. (1983) and could also be of importance.",

Integration seems to be required for virus replication and the integrated viral DNA is transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase I1 into virion RNA and mRNA.

There seems to be no clear correlation between antibody level and development of clinical symptoms after challenge with Norwalk virus (Blacklow et al., 1979 .

This protein is phosphorylated and purified Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) virions have been shown to contain a protein kinase activity. Coronavirions contain two major envelope proteins. The matrix protein is a transmembrane glyco- Siddell et al.. 1983.) protein of 20K to 35K. The glycosylated region of the protein is exterior to the virion envelope and in many cases matrix proteins with different degrees of glycosylation are incorporated into virions. The second corona virion envelope protein, which constitutes the surface peplomer, is responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies during infection and is thus vital for incorporation into any vaccine (Schmidt and Kenny, 1981) . In many cases different molecular weight forms (80K to 200K) of the protein are incorporated into virions. The protein is acylated and complex and mannose-rich carbohydrate side-chains are N-glycosydically linked to the polypeptide. Virions grown in cells treated with tunicamycin lack the peplomer protein and are unable to attach to cells or initiate infection. There are indications that for some coronaviruses proteolytic processing of the peplomer protein occurs during morphogenesis and may be involved in activating functions such as virusinduced cell fusion (Collins et al., 1982) . The coronavirus genome is a linear molecule of single-stranded RNA, which is polyadenylated and infectious. The genome RNA has a M.W. of 5 x loh to 7 x loh, corresponding to about 15 000 to 20 000 nucleotides ( Fig. 9.14) . TI-resistant oligonucleotide fingerprinting of genome RNA and intracellular viral mRNA confirms the positive polarity of the genome and indicates that it does not have extensive sequence reiteration Madge, 1978, Siddell et al., 1983) .",

The reason for this redistribution is unknown. Krzytyniak and Dupuy (1981) have shown that MHV3 uptake into cells is rapid and temperature-dependent. Uptake is not related to the phagocytic capacity of the cells and may, therefore, involve a mechanism such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, as has been reported for other virus-cell systems (Helenius et al., 1980 , and see Chapter 7 for example). The essential features of virus genome replication are: (i) the expression of coronavirus information in the cell is mediated through multiple subgenomic mRNAs, which form a 3' co-terminal nested set; (ii) as far as is known, each mRNA directs the translation of only one protein; (iii) the size of the translation product for each RNA corresponds approximately to the coding potential of the 5' sequences which are absent from the next smallest RNA. Although it has not been proven, these features and the inability of ribosomes to initiate translation at internal sites on eukaryotic mRNA suggest that only the 5' sequences of each mRNA (depicted as genes A, B, C, etc. in Fig. 9 .14) are translated into protein. This strategy has many parallels with the strategies of other positive-stranded RNA viruses (see Chapter 4). Also, the coronavirus strategy appears to be a flexible one, allowing for the control of viral protein synthesis at the levels of both transcription and translation.

The virions acquire their lipid envelope from the cells, excluding host cell proteins in the process, and are subsequently transported through and accumulate in the Golgi complex and smooth walled vesicles.
