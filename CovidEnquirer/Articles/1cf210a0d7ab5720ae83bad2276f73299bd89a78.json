            "text": "IL10 is generally regarded as a broad-spectrum regulatory cytokine. However, the role of IL10 in CD8 T cells remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of endogenous IL10 by CD8 T cells in gastric cancer (GC) patients. Using intracellular staining, we found that in both GC patients and healthy controls, the majority of IL10-expressing CD8 T cells also presented concurrent IFNg expression. Interestingly, the frequency of IFNg + IL10 + CD8 T cells was significantly higher in GC patients than in healthy controls, while the frequency of IFNg + IL10 -CD8 T cells was significantly lower in GC patients than in healthy controls. Compared to the IFNg -IL10 -CD8 T cells, both IFNg + IL10and IFNg + IL10 + CD8 T cells presented significantly higher expression of activation/inhibitory markers. Interestingly, the IFNg + IL10 + cells presented lower PD1 and TIM3 and higher KLRG1 than the IFNg + IL10 -CD8 T cells. Remarkably, the IFNg + IL10 + CD8 T cells, but not the IFNg + IL10 -CD8 T cells, were highly enriched in the CD45RO + CXCR5 + subset. Prolonged activation resulted in significant enrichment of IFNg + IL10 + CD8 T cells over time. Interestingly, compared to the CD45RO + CXCR5 -CD8 T cells, the CD45RO + CXCR5 + CD8 T cells presented stronger proliferation capacity at later stages of stimulation, and higher viability throughout the stimulation process. Overall, our investigation demonstrated that GC patients were enriched with a distinctive population of IFNg + IL10 + double positive CD8 T cells, which resembled T follicular cytotoxic cells and could persist longer during prolonged activation.",

However, only a tiny fraction of all H. pylori-infected individuals eventually develop GC [2] . The majority of infected cases remain asymptomatic through life. It is now understood that the chronic inflammatory response initiated by H. pylori critically contributes to GC pathogenesis [3] . Typically starting from the antral region that incites an inflammatory response, this H. pylori-mediated inflammation can gradually spread to the upper stomach over time and cause increasingly severe mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and malignant transformation at the gastric lining [4, 5] .",

H. pylori could directly elevate the expression of spermine oxidase in gastric epithelial cells and macrophages, and induce DNA damage through the production of reactive oxygen species [6, 7] . H. pylori and high salt diet also synergistically increase the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL1, IL6, and TNF, which possess angiogenic and pro-metastatic roles in tumor [8, 9] . Adaptive immune responses involving B cells and T cells likely also contributed to GC initiation. Mice infected with Helicobacter spp. showed symptoms of human GC patients, but not when B cells and T cells were absent [10, 11] . Further evidence demonstrated that Th1-mediated IFNg responses contributed to the gastric atrophy in mice infected with Helicobacter spp. [12, 13] .",

            "text": "On GC suppression once the tumor is established. Meta-analysis of tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC patients indicated that the frequency of tumor-infiltrating CD3 + T cells, especially the CD8 + TILs, was positively associated with overall survival [14] , while high expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor for regulatory T cells, in TILs was associated with reduced survival. High tumor-infiltrating CD3 + , CD8 + , and CD45RO + T cell frequency in addition was associated with lower lymph node metastasis and reduced recurrence following surgical resection [15, 16] . IL10 is a pleiotropic cytokine with multiple protective roles during inflammation. IL10 is shown to suppress innate and adaptive immune responses, mediate tissue repair, and maintain epithelium integrity [17] . In addition, IL10 can directly dampen the signal transduction of CD8 T cells, thus increasing the threshold required for antigen recognition and activation [18] . Interestingly, polymorphisms that increase IL10 production are associated with elevated GC risk [19] [20] [21] , which is contrary to the hypothesis that IL10 may prevent inflammation-induced disruption of the epithelium. Also, there is evidence that IL10 can promote the activation and expansion of tumor-resident CD8 T cells in murine tumor studies [22, 23] , which is in contrast with the common notion that IL10 inhibited CD8 T cell responses.",

The isolated CD8 T cells were then treated with anti-CD3/CD28 and IL2 to stimulate cytokine production. Using intracellular staining, we identified IFNg-expressing and IL10-expressing CD8 T cells in these subjects (Fig. 1A) . The frequency of IFNg-expressing IL10-nonexpressing (IFNg + IL10 -) CD8 T cells was at 12.9 \u00b1 0.5% (mean \u00b1 SEM) in healthy controls and significantly lower at 8.7 \u00b1 0.4% in GC patients (Fig. 1B) . The frequency of IFNg-expressing and IL10-expressing (IFNg + IL10 + ) CD8 T cells, on the other hand, was at 1.2 \u00b1 0.1% in healthy controls and markedly higher at 3.8 \u00b1 0.3% in GC patients (Fig. 1C) . The frequency of total IFNg-expressing (IFNg + IL10plus IFNg + IL10 + ) CD8 T cells was at 14.2 \u00b1 0.5% in healthy controls and slightly lower at 12.5 \u00b1 0.4% in GC patients (Fig. 1D) . Overall, these data demonstrated that GC patients presented an upregulation of the ",

In GC patients, IL10 expression level is positively associated with the density of microvessels and negatively associated with CD8 T cell infiltration in the tumor [26] . However, the appearance of IL10 is often accompanied by inhibitory immune cells, such as regulatory B cells, regulatory dendritic cells, M2-polarized macrophages, and tumor-associated macrophages [27] [28] [29] . Hence, some of the IL10mediated suppressive effects, previously described in other studies, might have required the coexistence of other inhibitory molecules and cell types. Indeed, IL10 in IL10 receptor (IL10R)-expressing CD8 T cells has been shown to strongly induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 and promote the in situ proliferation of tumor-resident CD8 T cells [22, 23] . In addition, in a coronavirus-infected murine encephalitis model, CD8 T cells that produced IL10 displayed higher cytokine and chemokine expression and stronger cytolytic activity [30] .",

In both healthy controls and GC patients, CD8 T cells that expressed IL10 could be observed following anti-CD3/CD28 and IL2 stimulation. Interestingly, IL10-single positive cells were rare, and the majority of IL10-expressing cells also presented concurrent IFNg expression. GC patients had more IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells than healthy controls, while healthy controls had more IFNg-single positive CD8 T cells than GC patients, which seemed to suggest that the IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cell population arose due to disease. We later found that prolonged stimulation alone could result in higher levels of IFNg/IL10-double positive cells and lower levels of IFNg-single positive cells. Hence, it is possible that CD8 T cells in GC patients are continuously being challenged with tumor antigens and/or H. pylori antigens, resulting in prolonged activation and higher frequencies of IFNg/IL10-double positive cells. In the future, the antigen specificity of IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells should be investigated.",

            "text": "A major limitation of this study is that we have not conclusively demonstrated the function of IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells in gastric cancer patients. We found that certain features of the IFNg/IL10double positive CD8 T cell subset, including lower PD1, lower TIM3, and higher KLRG1, resembled Tfc cells [25] . Indeed, we found that the IFNg/IL10-double positive cells were highly enriched in CD45RO + CXCR5 + CD8 T cells, while IFNg-single positive cells were enriched in CD45RO + CXCR5 -CD8 T cells. This feature would help us demonstrate the role of IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells in animal models using deletions and adoptive transfers. In past research, Tfc cells were shown to present stronger proliferation in response to PD1 blockade in exhausted CD8 T cells [31] , suggesting that they might be candidates of antitumor immunotherapy. However, regulatory functions also have been demonstrated in IL10-expressing CD8 T cells. For example, IL4 and IL12-induced IL10-expressing CD8 T cells was shown to inhibit graft-versus-host disease in vivo, and suppressed naive and effector T cell activation and IgG/IgE production [32] . Interestingly, CD8 T cell-mediated IL10 was shown to resolve chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain [33] . Hence, IL10 expression might serve multiple roles in CD8 T cells, and the function of IFNg/IL10-double positive CD8 T cells should be further investigated using animal models.",
