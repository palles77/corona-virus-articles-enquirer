Host cell invasion by T. gondii is a rapid process, typically completed in less than a minute [5] , and is also a multistep process which includes gliding motility, host cell attachment, and active penetration [6, 7] . To date, numerous researchers have reported parasitic factors involved in cell invasion [8, 9] , whereas little attention has been focused on the roles of host components in T. gondii infection. Therefore, the factors involved in T. gondii infection were explored from the perspective of the host cell in this article.",

            "text": "Host cell invasion by T. gondii is an active process that relies on regulated secretion of adhesive proteins and gliding motility powered by the Ivyspring International Publisher actin-myosin motor complex [10] . This process also relies on host cell cytoskeleton reorganization, which is regulated by T. gondii during infection [11] . Disruption of host cell actin cytoskeleton integrity decreases T. gondii cell invasion [12] . Vimentin, a type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein, is highly conserved in all vertebrates and is dynamically expressed and undergoes a complex phosphorylation pattern during development and differentiation [13, 14] . Vimentin has critical implications for pathophysiology; for example, it is not only an organizer of a number of critical proteins involved in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling [15, 16] , it also has key roles in bacterial [17] and viral [18, 19] infections, including pathogen entry and multiplication. A significant rearrangement of host cell vimentin around the Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) occurs throughout the course of infection, and this association between host cell vimentin and PVs can be observed within an hour after T. gondii invasion [20] . Moreover, the expression of vimentin in different cells or tissues is regulated by T. gondii infection. For example, vimentin expression is up-regulated in M\u00fcller cells in a mouse model of congenital ocular toxoplasmosis [21] , while it is down-regulated in Toxoplasma-infected macrophages [22] .",

TgROP18 can target members of the mouse IFN-\u03b3 inducible large GTPases (immunity-related GTPases [IRGs]), such as Irgb6 [25, 26] , and phosphorylate human ATF6\u03b2 [27] , to mediate its virulence during infection.

To disrupt rop18, we designed a guide RNA (gRNA) to target the 5\u2032 coding region of rop18 (sgROP18), and paired this sgRNA with a PCR amplicon consisting of the DHFR* selectable marker reading frame, flanked with regions homologous to rop18 ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary Material). Parasites were co-transfected with the sgROP18 CRISPR plasmid and homology template, and the recombinant tachyzoites were screened with pyrimethamine and obtained by limiting dilution. Single clones were isolated and verified by PCR to confirm the disruption of rop18 and integration of the DHFR * cassette ( Figure 1B ). To tag endogenous rop18 in T. gondii RH, a Cas9/CRISPR gRNA targeting the C-terminus of rop18 was generated and a homologous template was prepared, as described in methods ( Figure 1C ), and these were cotransfected into RH tachyzoites to generate rop18 with an eGFP-FLAG-tag at its C-terminus. Recombinant clones were confirmed by PCR (using genomic DNA as template) ( Figure  1D ), immunofluorescence (IF) ( Figure 1E ), and western blotting (WB) ( Figure 1F ). A.

Vimentin phosphorylation patterns in host cells infected with T. gondii for different amounts of time were determined by Phos-tag assays and western blotting. Vimentin phosphorylation levels were highest at 6h post-infection and subsequently decreased to, and were maintained at low levels compared with uninfected cells ( Figure 3C ).

When vimentin was knocked out, the efficiency of T. gondii invasion increased significantly ( Figure 4B and C), while no significant difference was found in the number of parasites per vacuole between the two groups ( Figure  4D and E). T. gondii proliferation assays were also performed in HFF cells with or without vimentin knockdown, and the results were consistent with the findings of the tests in HBMEC \u0394Vim and wild type cells ( Figure S2 ). To further investigate the functions of vimentin in the lytic cycle of T. gondii, parasite egress, triggered by the Ca 2+ ionophore A23187, was assayed. No significant difference was identified in the percentage of egressed vacuoles between HBMEC and HBMEC \u2206Vim, infected with RH/GFP ( Figure 4F and G). Together, these results suggest that host cell vimentin inhibited the invasion of T. gondii into HBMEC, but had no significant influence on T. gondii proliferation or egress. gondii (as described above) were detected by WB. Dynamic expression levels were observed after infection with T. gondii for different periods of time. These results suggest that the solubility, phosphorylation, and expression levels of vimentin were regulated by T. gondii infection, and that the higher phosphorylation level of vimentin may correlate with a decrease in its solubility.

Host cell vimentin solubility was significantly different between cells infected with RH WT and RH \u0394rop18 at 1, 6, 24, 36, and 48h, suggesting that the solubility of vimentin was partly affected by TgROP18, in addition to other unknown parasitic factors ( Figure 7A , B, and C). To further investigate the effects of TgROP18 on vimentin solubility, Cos7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-ROP18-flag. Much higher vimentin solubility was observed in cells over-expressing TgROP18 than in controls ( Figure 8A and B). The phosphorylation level of vimentin in Cos7 cells infected with RH \u2206rop18 was also evaluated using Phos-tag assays, and the results indicated that there was a trend towards up-regulation of vimentin with the extension of infection time ( Figure 7D ). Comparison of these results with the changes in vimentin phosphorylation levels in cells infected with RH WT for different periods of time (Figure 3 ), suggested that TgROP18 affects the phosphorylation of vimentin ( Figure 7D ). To further explore the effects of ROP18 on vimentin, kinase assays in vitro were performed to determine whether vimentin was phosphorylated by the TgROP18 kinase. The results suggested TgROP18 could phosphorylate host cell vimentin in vitro ( Figure 7E ). Intriguingly, the changes in vimentin solubility and phosphorylation levels in cells infected with RH WT (Figure 7) were much more complex than those in cells over-expressing ROP18 (Figure 8) , suggesting that the dynamic patterns of vimentin solubility and phosphorylation induced by T. gondii infection were partly regulated by TgROP18, and may contribute to the reorganization of host cell vimentin. Furthermore, compared with the protein levels of vimentin in Cos7 cells infected with RH WT (Figure 3D ), no significant changes were observed in cells infected with RH \u2206rop18 (Figure 7F ), indicating that the expression levels of vimentin were not clearly affected byTgROP18. Additionally, over-expression of ROP18 in Cos7 cells did not have obvious effects on host cell vimentin expression ( Figure 8C ). gondii RH/GFP for 30min and host-cell invasion was evaluated by a two-color assay to distinguish intracellular from extracellular parasites.

Moreover, vimentin is identified as a novel NF-\u03baB regulator and is involved in modulating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to influence invasion of pathogens, such as E. coli K1 [31, 32] . The disassembly of vimentin caused by treatment with high concentrations of the phosphatase inhibitors, okadaic acid and calyculin A, suggests that vimentin's assembly/disassembly is regulated by its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation [20] . The assembly and solubility of vimentin are regulated by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of vimentin at Ser38 and Ser55 induced by Rab7a [33] . Moreover, phosphorylation level of vimentin Ser38 was significantly upregulated in host cell infected with T. gondii at both 2h and 6h comparing to host cell without T. gondii infection [34] . Consistent with the above reports, higher vimentin expression corresponding to much lower solubility in host cell with T. gondii infection for 2h and 6h, which also suggest that vimentin phosphorylation is associated with its solubility. The reorganization of cellular vimentin is also affected by its solubility, which is, in turn, regulated by its phosphorylation [35, 36] . Progressive rearrangement of vimentin around the enlarging PVs was reported at 30min, 12h, and 18h post-infection [20] , and vimentin forms a dynamic, flexible network and contributes to maintenance of the integrity of the cellular actin cytoskeleton [37] . Consistent with previous findings, a significant rearrangement of vimentin was also observed in our study in cells infected with T. gondii for different periods of time (1, 2, 6, 12, and 22h) post-infection, from invasion to multiplication (Figure 2) , and variable changes in vimentin solubility, phosphorylation, and expression levels were also observed during T. gondii infection at different time points (1, 2, 6, 12,24, 36, and 48h) (Figure 3 ).",

TgROP18 can interact with, and phosphorylate host cell proteins, such as ATF6\u03b2 and Irga6, to facilitate parasite infection [23, 25, 27] . Interestingly, host cell vimentin was found to interact with TgROP18 in our previous protein interaction screening based on BiFC, and the results of this study verified those findings further using FRET and Co-IP experiments ( Figure  6 ). In our previous phosphoproteinomics assays of T. gondii infected HFF cells, host cell vimentin exhibited a complex phosphorylation pattern at different infection times [34] . In this study, a dynamic phosphorylation pattern of vimentin was identified in host cells infected with T. gondii RH and RH \u0394rop18 strains using phos-Tag assays, and the results indicated that the phosphorylation pattern of vimentin was partly affected by T. gondii ROP18; moreover, vimentin phosphorylated by TgROP18 was also demonstrated by our kinase assay in vitro (Figure 7) .",

To determine whether the solubility of vimentin was affected by TgROP18, vimentin solubility assays were performed using Cos7 cells infected with T. gondii RH and RH \u0394rop18, and the results indicated that vimentin solubility was partly regulated by TgROP18, in addition to other unknown parasitic factors ( Figure  7) . We also found that the expression levels of vimentin were regulated by the T. gondii infection; however, they were not significantly affected by T. gondii ROP18 (Figure 3D and 7F). In summary, the dynamic patterns of vimentin phosphorylation, solubility, and expression levels were regulated by T. gondii infection, while its phosphorylation level and solubility were only partly affected by TgROP18. Hence, while vimentin has important roles in T. gondii infection, only its phosphorylation and solubility, but not its expression levels, are affected by TgROP18. Maintenance of host cell actin cytoskeleton integrity is important during the T. gondii lytic cycle, including invasion and egress. For example, host cell actin cytoskeleton integrity is essential for successful T. gondii invasion [12] , since T. gondii invasion was blocked when host cell actin polymerization was inhibited using cytochalasin D [44] . There is evidence that actin organization and actin cytoskeleton integrity may be modulated by host cell vimentin [45] . Herein, in our present study we found that T. gondii invasion was affected by host cell vimentin. When vimentin was knocked out in HBMEC cells, the infection rate of T. gondii was significantly increased (Figure 4 ). The result, indicating inhibition of host cell vimentin on T. gondii invasion, is opposite to those demonstrated for Escherichia coli K1 and Japanese encephalitis virus infection [31, 46] , suggesting that vimentin regulates infection of T. gondii and other microbial pathogens by different mechanisms.",

T. gondii exhibits a definite neurotropism and much higher number of cysts located in the brain than other organs [47] . Low vimentin expression levels favor T. gondii invasion into host cells, which is consistent with the fact of more cysts in the brain than in other organs. Strong and persistent cell-mediated immunity, mainly Th1 responses, is activated by T. gondii infection, and can protect the host from rapid tachyzoite proliferation and consequent pathology [48, 49] . CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations are increased in the spleens of mice immunized with T. gondii [50] ; therefore, although low expression levels of vimentin were also observed in this organ, it develops no more cysts than other tissues.",

Moreover, expression levels of vimentin were affected by T. gondii infection, but not by TgROP18. Furthermore host cell vimentin was phosphorylated by TgROP18 and played an important role in the inhibition of T. gondii invasion. Our findings revealed a new mechanism of T. gondii regulation on host cell cytoskeleton reorganization through its effects on vimentin phosphorylation, solubility, and expression, and the contribution of TgROP18 to this regulatory process.",
