Phylogeography plays a major role in infectious disease surveillance, viral epidemiology and vaccine design. When conducting viral phylogeographic studies, researchers require the location of the infected host of the virus, which is often present in public databases such as GenBank. However, the geographic metadata in most GenBank records is not precise enough for many phylogeographic studies; therefore, researchers often need to search the articles linked to the records for more information, which can be a tedious process. Here, we describe two approaches for automatically detecting geographic location mentions in articles pertaining to virus-related GenBank records: a supervised sequence labeling approach with innovative features and a distant-supervision approach with novel noisereduction methods. Evaluated on a manually annotated gold standard, our supervised sequence labeling and distant supervision approaches attained F-scores of 0.81 and 0.66, respectively.",

However, in our prior work [9, 10] , we showed that the geographic metadata available in such databases are often not sufficient depending on the level of geographic granularity required for the study. For example, a GenBank record might contain the geographic metadata USA but the researcher may require a state name such as New Hampshire. One solution is to read the corresponding journal article (if one exists) in PubMed Central [11] or from the publisher's website in order to find if a more specific location is provided. However, this can be an arduous process since phylogeography datasets often contains hundreds of virus sequences, many of which contain links to different articles.",

In [13] we described and evaluated a toponym resolver, optimized for research articles linked to GenBank records. Although we achieved state-of-the-art performance for disambiguation, the performance of our toponym detection was mediocre. Based on a gazetteer and manually defined rules, our toponym detector, with a score of 0.90 recall, was able to detect most of the toponyms in each article but, * These authors contributed equally to the study. with a score of 0.60 precision, was not able to discriminate ambiguous phrases, such as names of persons or animals (like \"turkey\"), from the toponyms (\"Turkey\", the country).",

Our first approach is a toponym detector based on graphical models, namely conditional random fields (CRF). Modeling the problem of toponym detection as a sequence labeling task, and via the use of annotated data and the extraction of several useful features, we achieve significant improvements over our past work [13] , with an F-score of 0.81 for the toponym class. However, the performance of this approach is limited by the size of the manually annotated data set available, which is expensive and time-consuming to prepare. Therefore, we additionally explore the use of distant supervision. Distant supervision, also known as Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU Learning) [14] , is a particular learning framework where only a finite set of positive examples are known and an important quantity of unlabeled examples are available. Knowledge resources and rules are used to automatically extract additional training examples. In this study, we propose an innovative solution exploiting GenBank and distant supervision to increase the number of toponyms examples in our corpus, and discuss its possible benefits for toponym detection.",

The corpus represents a total volume of 500,000 tokens. We converted the articles from PDF to text format using a free off-the-shelf pdf converter, pdf-to-text \u2021 . Two graduate students manually annotated the corpus. The students had knowledge in biology and past experiences in corpus annotation for natural language processing. Both annotators were asked to strictly follow a guideline for detecting and disambiguating the toponyms. The guideline was specially written for this task and is available for download with the corpus at http://diego.asu.edu/downloads. We randomly selected 16 articles and both annotators annotated them independently in order to compute the inter-annotator agreement. Here, we calculated the precision and recall of one annotator while holding the other as the gold standard. With a good precision and recall of 0.97 and 0.98 respectively, we found toponym detection on this corpus to be consistent between the \u2021 Available at http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html annotators. In [13] , we discuss the details of the disagreements and their reasons. The resulting corpus contains 1,881 occurrences of 379 distinct toponyms associated with their coordinates. We found the average number of occurrences of toponyms in an article to be four and the maximum number to be 264. We also identified China as the most frequent toponym with 209 occurrences in our corpus.",

CRFs have been shown to be particularly useful for structured prediction from lexical data as they take into account neighboring samples when making classification decisions. As such, CRFs have been particularly successful in natural language classification tasks, such as named entity recognition where sequential information is crucial [24, 26] . For our problem, we used the pythonbased CRFSuite-sklearn library [27] and explored the effects of a variety of lexical and semantic features on toponym detection performance. We randomly selected 12 documents (20%) from our annotated corpus to serve as a blind test set and used the rest of the 48 annotated documents (80%) for training and feature analysis. Toponym mentions in text can consist of single tokens (e.g., Phoenix) or multiple tokens (e.g., New York). To prepare the input data for model training, we tokenized all the text in an input document and tagged each token using the beginning, inside, outside (BIO) scheme, which is a common representation for similar sequence labeling tasks. Given an untagged token, along with selected contextual information and the generated features, the task of the supervised learner is to predict in which of the three BIO classes the token is most likely to belong. In Figure 1 , we show a sample sentence and the representation used to train the CRF classifier. The leftmost column shows the tokens, the Annotation column shows the token-level annotations, and the four columns on the right show four sample features and their representations. For multi-word named entities, the first token is given the B tag and all the following tokens are given the I tag. All other tokens are given the O tag, indicating that they do not belong to any toponyms.",

We used vector representations of words learned from PubMed data [30] and applied k-means clustering [31] to group all the tokens into k groups, with each group consisting of tokens that are close together in semantic space (i.e., conceptually similar). Each of the k clusters is assigned a cluster number and, thus, each cluster number represents a set of very conceptually similar tokens. Figure  1 illustrates, for example, that 'China' and 'Korea' share the same cluster number. Names of other countries also belong to the same cluster. Other terms such as 'South' have the same cluster number as 'North', 'Eastern' and 'Central'.

In GenBank, all records are identified by an accession number. When a researcher is uploading a new genetic sequence to the database, they are asked to provide additional metadata about the sequence. This includes the research article where the sequence is described and, when available, the infected host (human or animal), its location, and the date of collection. For our experiment, we have analyzed the metadata of all viral sequences recorded in GenBank (the released of April 2016 contains around 2 million sequences). When reviewing a record, if the location of the infected host was provided, we checked if the article describing the sequence was contained in the PubMed Central Open Access subset \u00a7 . If yes, we downloaded the article and processed it with our NLP pipeline [13] . In the article, we considered all occurrences of the place of the infected host as positive examples of a toponym. For example, the sequence identified by the accession EF213768 indicates \"Japan: Hokkaido\" ** and it is linked to the article [32] . After processing the article, we found nine sentences containing at least one occurrence of the word Japan such as in the sentence S1. Following this procedure, we extracted 89,541 occurrences which we assume to be positive examples of toponyms. \uf0b7 For each word in this set we ran a statistical t-test to determine if the word was correlated with the toponyms in our corpus or not. Words like isolated, from, or near were found to appear more frequently in a sentence containing a toponym rather than to appear in a sentence with no toponym. We call the subset of words correlated with the toponyms the \"tabboo words\". \uf0b7 We computed the set A, the set of all sentences where at least one phrase occurring in a sentence was found in GeoNames (the phrase could or could not be a toponym). We removed from the set A all sentences containing at least one tabboo word. The set of sentences obtained was the set B and B was used to create our negative examples. \uf0b7 Each phrase of the sentences in the set B which was found in GeoNames is assumed to be a negative example.

From the figure it can be seen that the precision of our model is not significantly affected by the size of the training data. This is because once the supervised learning algorithm is exposed to examples of locations, it is able to correctly identify them on most occasions. Recall, however, steadily improves as more training data is included. This improvement is driven by the increase in overall coverage of the training data. We fit a logarithmic trend line to the F-scores and extrapolated to forecast the performance of our classifier in the presence of additional annotated data. The trend line indicates gradual improvements even at 150% of the data. This strongly suggests that the best performance reported here, despite being significantly better than past approaches, is still below the performance ceiling and our CRF classifier is expected to benefit from the bigger set of training examples generated during our experiment with distant supervision.",

Because a sequence classifier simultaneously labels all words of a given sentence, all labels of the words of a sentence have to be known during training. This constraint does not apply to train a regular classifier. A regular classifier labels each words independently based on the features describing the context and the word to classify. The classifier ignores all decisions it took on the previous phrases of the sentence. Consequently, we plan to train a regular classifier on our large set of examples and to run this classifier to annotate all the sentences containing at least one phrase found in GeoNames, the set A. We will use the set A annotated by our regular classifier in a future experiment to train a robust sequence classifier and will compare the performances of the sequence classifier with the performances of our current CRF trained on our training corpus.",

If a phrase is found in GeoNames, to perform its classification, our classifier describes the phrases and their contexts with 18 features. These features are standard features for NE detection, such as the phrase as a string, if it starts with an uppercase, the POS tags and the string of the five words that appears before and after the phrase. To evaluate our classifier, we trained our classifier on 66% of the training examples generated with distant supervision and evaluate on the rest of the examples. We achieved 94.2% accuracy where only 1,157 toponyms and 839 non-toponyms were incorrectly labeled. Surprisingly, when we trained our classifier on the full set of the training examples generated and evaluated it on the 12 articles used to evaluate our CRF classifier in the previous experiment, the performances of our regular classifier were disappointing with a 0.66 F-score (0.52 Precision and 0.89 Recall), which was lower than our initial rule-based system. A possible explanation for this result might be the strong imbalance between the positive and negative examples in the training set. The prior probability for a phrase to be a toponym is too high causing the classifier to classify most of the phrases as \"toponym\" despite the evidences of the features. For examples, the word Tris is a name of a toponym in GeoNames and it appears 79 times in our training examples. In all training examples Tris was an organic compound and correctly labeled as \"not toponym\". When evaluating on the test corpus the word Tris was found four times and always incorrectly classified as \"toponym\".",

Our toponym detector based on Conditional Random Fields exploits various categories of features to label jointly all toponyms occurring in a sentence. With an overall F-score of 0.81 our classifier can still be improved by providing more training examples. We proposed to use the metadata of GenBank to extract automatically a large number of examples from PubMed articles. The main limitation of this distant supervision method is the inability to train our CRF, a sequence classifier, directly from the examples extracted. Since only a subset of the toponyms occurring in a sentence is discovered, we were forced to label the unknown phrases of the sentence with a regular classifier.",

We are expecting an important improvement of the precision of our classifier without sacrificing the good recall allowed by the large coverage of GeoNames. As future work, we will balance our set of training examples by generating more negative examples based on incompatible NEs. In this study, we used the country metadata field in GenBank to find toponyms in articles. Other fields such as host, strain, species or authors can be used to extract other types of NEs with the same method. We will use the occurrences of these new NEs in the articles as new negative examples of toponyms.",

The precision of our method on this sample was 0.84 with a total number of 502 occurrences and only 78 False Positives (FP), i.e. occurrences which were not considered as toponyms by the annotator. The 78 errors can be divided in 4 categories. The first category is the use of a location name as adjective in a virus name such as \"the Aravan virus\" or \"Japan Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1)\". With 37 cases this is the most common error. However, the majority of the errors were made on one article in which the same virus name is repeated 34 times. The second category, with 22 cases, is a location used as a part of an institute name such as \"Sendai Medical Center\" or \"Damanhour University\". The third category counts only 14 cases of strains where a name of location is inserted, for example in A/chicken/Egypt/C3Br11/2007. The last category is marginal with location names in URL or email addresses.Similarly, we measured the quality of the negative examples by manually analyzing 265 occurrences that we randomly selected from our corpus. Our method shows a good precision with a score of 0.94. Among the 265 GeoNames entries mentioned in our negative examples only 15 were actual False Negative (FN), i.e. real toponym in the sentences. All 15 FNs follow the same pattern: the authors describe a product used in an experiment and provide the company manufacturing the product in parenthesis along with the location of the company (e.g. \"Purified IgG were concentrated by Microcon 50 columns (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and stored at -20\u00b0C.\"[36], p\u00b05). In these sentences the toponyms are understood by their semantic relations with the companies while no lexical or syntactical clues are provided to indicate their presence. Unfortunately, our method exploits only lexical and syntactical clues.The training examples extracted with distant supervision exhibit a good quality, however a closer inspection reveals the limitations of our method. We extracted a small number of negative examples in comparison with the total number of positive examples (11,927 and 89,541 respectively). Moreover, an examination of the first 50 sentences extracted as negative examples show that, because of the construction process, the sentences tend to be short, ungrammatical and repeated. The average size of the 50 sentences was 10 words. Twelve sentences were ungrammatical because they were incorrectly segmented by our algorithm and 26 sentences were identical or followed similar patterns like \"Click here for additional data file.\" and \"Performed the experiments: MS JRCO ASDG KT CSD.\"Despite these limitations, the number and the quality of the examples extracted are high enough to train a classifier for NE detection. Although sequence classifiers, such as a CRFs, are known to perform better on NE detection than regular classifiers[34], a sequence classifier cannot be directly trained from our set of extracted examples.",
