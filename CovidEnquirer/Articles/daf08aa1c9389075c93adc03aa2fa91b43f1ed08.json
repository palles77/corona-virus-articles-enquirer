Berkelhammer et al. (1982) described leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity against allogeneic tumor cells in melanoma beating Sinclair miniature swine but without further characterization of the effector cell population. In the Munich Troll \u00ae miniature swine there is, similar to the Sinclair miniature swine, a high incidence of heritable melanomas (Wanke and Briiuer, 1986) . This situation led to the establishment oflong-term in vitro culture of homogenous melanoma cells derived from a cutaneous melanoma at necropsy. Significant incidence of spontaneous regression is observed in Sinclair swine (Oxenhandler et al., 1979 ) as well as in Munich Troll \u00ae swine cutaneous melanoma and metastasis with manifestation of tumors in internal organs is rare. This clinical situation makes the effects of cell-mediated immunity on melanoma tumor growth and regression an object of special interest (Beattie et al., 1988; Br/~cker et al., 1988) .",

The addition of natural human IL-2 at a dose of 100 U/ml during the test time resulted in about the same enhancement of NK-CMC regardless of whether xenogeneic or aUogeneic target cells were used.

This observation is not restricted to Troll \u00ae miniature swine blood donors with melanoma inheritance; it is equally seen with blood lymphocytes from German Landrace swine. It might be caused totoxic or stimulatory cytokines as already suggested by Pinto and Fergusson ( 1988 ) . Structures mediating the recognition of tumor target cells by NK cells are yet unknown but their function is thought to be distinct from that triggering the cytolytic process (Targan and Newman, i 983; Chervenak and Wolcott, 1988 ). This has previously been shown in studies on the mechanisms of defective NK cell activity in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Bonavida et al., 1986; Sirianni et al., 1988 ) . Low NK cell activity has also been described by Hersey et al. (1979) in familial melanoma patients and their relatives. The assessment of peripheral blood NK cell activity in tumor patients as a diagnostic or prognostic parameter suffers from many imponderabilities (Pross, 1986) .",
