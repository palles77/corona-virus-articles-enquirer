The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Serial chest radiographies (CXRs) were obtained from viral exposure until death or discharge in 35 patients with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection. Radiographic scores were calculated by multiplying a four-point scale of involved lung area and threepoint scale of abnormal opacification, in each of the six lung zones. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to identify optimal day and radiographic score for the prediction of respiratory distress, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess significant predictive factors for intubation or tracheostomy. Among 35 patients (22 men, 13 women; median age: 48 years), 25 demonstrated abnormal opacity on CXR (MERS pneumonia), whereas no abnormality was detected in 10 patients (MERS upper respiratory tract infection). Seven patients required ventilator support (intubation group) and three of them eventually expired. The average incubation period was 5.4 days (standard deviation, \u00b1 2.8; range, 2-11). Patients in the intubation group had a higher incidence of diffuse lung involvement, higher radiographic scores, and fibrosing sequela on follow up study compared with those in the non-intubation group. However, patients' age and comorbidity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The ROC analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.726 for the radiographic score on day 10 with an optimal cutoff score of 10 for prediction of intubation, with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 67%. Our study suggest that MERS patients with radiographic score > 10 on day 10 from viral exposure require aggressive therapy with careful surveillance and follow-up evaluation.",

The first case of MERS in Korea reported on May 20, 2015 , was that of an individual who had developed the disease after traveling to the Middle East countries. Subsequently, this case led to the largest transmission cluster of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in 186 confirmed MERS cases in Korea [4] .

Because MERS can be transmitted through direct or indirect exposure to MERS-CoV, infection control in health care facilities is a critical issue [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Patients diagnosed with MERS should be moved to an institutional isolation care unit and personal protective equipment is mandatory for health care workers who handle these patients. Thus, CXR would play a pivotal role in the evaluation of patients with several infectious diseases, including MERS, because it is rapid and easily accessible, compared with computed tomography (CT). Indeed, we relied on the findings of sequential CXR while managing the 36 patients with MERS-CoV infection in clinical practice. However, there is still limited information about the prognostic implication of CXR findings in patients with MERS. Thus, the aim of this study was two-fold. First, we were to describe the serial radiographic characteristics of MERS-CoV pneumonia by analyzing radiographic scores. Second, we tried to identify the earliest cutoff value of radiographic score, which can be considered as a potential prognostic indicator of fatal outcomes in patients with MERS-CoV pneumonia.",

After 2 days (May 29), he reported that he had met another patient with MERS approximately 10 days ago, at a different hospital. The patient was immediately transferred to an isolation care unit. The MERS-CoV infection was confirmed by a sputum assay on May 30. During his stay in the ER, numerous individuals were in contact with him directly or indirectly. Individuals with a possibility of exposure to this virus were quarantined and laboratory tests were conducted if symptoms were noted during the observational period. Consequently, 81 cases of MERS-CoV infection resulting from the exposure at the ER were confirmed, resulting in a total of 90 cases of MERS-CoV infection diagnosed at our institution [8] . Among the 90 patients, 36 were hospitalized in the isolation care unit of our institution. One patient with underlying stagefour lymphoma was not included in this study, as this condition could adversely affect the prognosis.

The ground-glass opacity was defined as an area of hazy increased lung opacity, within which margins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct [11] . Consolidation appears as a homogeneous increase in pulmonary parenchymal attenuation that obscures the margins of vessels and airway walls [11] . Each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones, was then graded based on the following scale (according to the area of the lung affected): 0 if normal, 1 if less than 25% of abnormality, 2 if 25-50% abnormality, 3 if 50-75% abnormality, and 4 if > 75% abnormality was noted. The four-point scale of the lung involvement was then multiplied by the 3-point scale of parenchymal abnormality in each lung zone, resulting in points ranging from 0 to 12 [12, 13] . Points from all zones were added to arrive at a final total cumulative score, with values ranging from 0 to 72 (Fig. 1) .",

Our study highlights the clinical implication of radiographic scores as a prognostic indicator in patients with MERS.

In addition, out study demonstrated that patients' age and comorbidity did not differ significantly between intubation and nonintubation groups in patients with MERS pneumonia. These results are in contrast with the previous reports, including one by Das et al., which suggested that geriatric immunocompromised patients with MERS are at higher risk of fatal outcomes [15] [16] [17] [18] . We found out that development of MERS pneumonia, rather than final outcome, was more frequently noted in patients with comorbidities. Indeed, none of the patients with MERS URI had premorbid conditions. We think that it can explain one of the mechanisms that patient's comorbidities had finally led to poor prognosis in previous reports. Current study emphasizes the importance of careful CXR monitoring in patients with MERS-CoV infection, regardless of patients' age and premorbid conditions.",

We think that a small number of study population was a major drawback of our result, which hindered statistical significance. As there is limited number of patients with MERS, we hope that external validation of our radiographic scoring system would be performed by other MERS-CoV research group to establish a role of radiographic score as a prognostic indicator in MERS pneumonia. Third, daily CXRs were not available in most cases, as CXR scans were obtained on every other day in the recovery phase. To overcome the issue, we applied 3-day moving average value of radiographic scores to minimize the potential error. Lastly, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC of radiographic score might not be sufficiently high enough. We admit that CXR may not be the most efficient diagnostic or prognostic tool for patients with MERS. However, we should not overlook the clinical utility of CXR as an indispensable modality for patients with this highly contagious disease.",

We suggest that radiographic scores can play a vital role in the management of patients with MERS because of the ability to predict respiratory distress necessitating ventilator support. Patients with radiographic score \u2265 10 on day 10 from viral exposure are in need of aggressive therapy with careful surveillance and follow-up evaluation.",
