            "text": "Introduction: Considerable advocacy, funding, training, and technical support have been provided to South Asian countries to strengthen One Health (OH) collaborative approaches for controlling diseases with global human pandemic potential since the early 2000s. It is essential that the OH approach continues to be strengthened given South Asia is a hot spot for emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases. The objectives of this article are to describe OH research and training and capacity building activities and the important developments in government support for OH in these countries to identify current achievements and gaps. Materials and methods: A landscape analysis of OH research, training, and government support in South Asia was generated by searching peer-reviewed and grey literature for OH research publications and reports, a questionnaire survey of people potentially engaged in OH research in South Asia and the authors' professional networks. Results: Only a small proportion of zoonotic disease research conducted in South Asia can be described as truly OH, with a significant lack of OH policy-relevant research. A small number of multisectoral OH research and OH capacity building programmes were conducted in the region. The governments of Bangladesh and Bhutan have established operational OH strategies, with variable progress institutionalising OH in other countries. Identified gaps were a lack of useful scientific information and of a collaborative culture for formulating and implementing integrated zoonotic disease control policies and the need for ongoing support for transdisciplinary OH research and policy-relevant capacity building programmes. Discussion: Overall we found a very small number of truly OH research and capacity building programmes in South Asia. Even though significant progress has been made in institutionalising OH in some South Asian countries, further behavioural, attitudinal, and institutional changes are required to strengthen OH research and training and implementation of sustainably effective integrated zoonotic disease control policies. C ollaborative One Health (OH) approaches that integrate the formulation, funding, implementation, and governance of control policies involving human, animal, and wildlife populations are required to more effectively control endemic zoonotic diseases and to detect and manage emerging zoonotic diseases (1). This is especially important in South Asia, which is a hot spot for endemic and emerging infectious zoonotic diseases (2, 3).",

Supported by advocacy, expertise, and funding from international agencies, governments in South Asia formulated and implemented multidisciplinary collaborative frameworks and operational programmes to combat outbreaks of zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, H5N1). There has been a lesser effort to support research and policy development for managing endemic zoonotic diseases, despite evidence of the high impact of these diseases (6) . The challenge is to extend the OH approach from disease issues of global concern to endemic or neglected zoonoses of national and regional concern (9), which in itself is likely to strengthen the ability to detect newly emerging diseases (10) .",

However, policies for managing endemic diseases in the region are largely ad hoc (11, 12) . Zoonotic disease research is also largely ad hoc, and a large proportion of the research focuses on the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic tests rather than evidence for policy formulation and implementation (13, 14) . There is a need for policy-relevant research, generating evidence of zoonotic disease impacts, and of the effectiveness and economic value of OH approaches (15, 16) , in addition to stakeholder perspectives to formulate sustainable policies for zoonotic disease control. Ideally, OH research should involve the integrated analysis and interpretation of data on human and animal health and their environments such that the research 'leads to insights that would not be visible without inter-sectoral collaboration, such as impacts of multi-host infections on humans, animal and ecosystem health and economics' (17) . Truly transdisciplinary research, the hallmark of OH or EcoHealth approaches, involves multidisciplinary teams addressing OH research questions within a common conceptual framework (18) .",

Multidisciplinarity was ascertained from the author affiliations in published papers. 2. A multidisciplinary, multi-study research programme on a health-related topic. The programme includes individual studies that may involve researchers from only one discipline and/or data collection from either human or animal populations, but the studies are designed in an integrated way within the programme so that the results of each study can be interpreted together and contribute to designing integrated approaches to zoonotic disease control.",

Other significant OH training and capacity building programmes are Relief International's (62) . While there have been many challenges to integrating the activities of the three large international organisations in the region, the tri-partite has facilitated inter-sectoral relationships and awareness of OH approaches through annual regional meetings on multisectoral collaboration for the prevention and control of zoonoses since 2010. Each of the three organisations individually contributes to strengthening OH in the region. The WHO South East Asian Regional Office is supporting the development of a regionally integrated rabies control programme. Changes to the WHO's International Health Regulations are a driver for the human health sector to report on zoonotic diseases. FAO's Regional Support Unit for SAARC is the only sub-regional institution and coordination mechanism in South Asia dealing with animal health, and OH components are incorporated where possible. OIE supports the strengthening of veterinary services, predominantly through the Performance of Veterinary Services tool (www.oie.int/ support-to-oie-members/pvs-evaluations/oie-pvs-tool/). Massey University implemented a regional OH capacity building programme to strengthen epidemiology and health risk management skills through integrated OH Master's education and applied epidemiology training, funded by the Avian and Human Influenza Facility (AHIF), administered by the World Bank from 2010 to 2013 (www.onehealthnet work.asia/node/313). Under the programme, an OH Hub was established in six countries, led by the two government institutions responsible for human and animal health in each country, providing a networking and communication platform for individuals from government, nongovernment, university institutions, professional bodies, and international organisations working in OH-related areas. The OH Network \u00c1 South Asia was established in Hubnet, a web-based communication and collaborative system developed by the Massey University, with a current membership of 249 professionals working in OH-related areas in South Asia. A national OH symposium was supported in each country, culminating with a regional OH symposium (Paro, Bhutan December 2013) during which nine regional resolutions were formulated to strengthen OH in the region (www.onehealthnetwork. asia/node/492).",

A similar situation was identified with respect to rabies research in India, despite efforts of the Roadmap to Combat Zoonoses in India to provide strategic direction for multidisciplinary zoonotic disease research through a strategic research agenda (4). While most animal health institutions in South Asia conduct zoonotic disease research, a large proportion of which estimates disease prevalence in animal populations, very few public health institutions conduct zoonotic disease research. As a result, there is a significant lack of reliable information on the burden of zoonotic diseases in human populations, despite evidence that the impact of some zoonoses is higher than that of malaria, and comparable to that of HIV/AIDS (47) . Reliable estimates of zoonotic disease burdens in humans as well as in animals are important for formulating effective zoonotic disease control policies. There is a major need for well-coordinated and well-designed zoonotic disease research programmes, integrated within an OH framework to produce information of value in both human and animal populations for the development of effective integrated OH disease control policies.",

Such large-scale programmes that provide a suitable framework for integrated OH research require considerable resourcing and effective management and leadership to integrate the multidisciplinary inputs necessary to produce information of value for zoonotic disease control policy. While these programmes have been supported by international funding sources, national organisations such as the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research have the potential to fund such multidisciplinary multi-study programmes. The OH strategies developed in Bangladesh and Bhutan provide the framework for collaborative leadership and coordinated funding and implementation of integrated OH research programmes in their countries. However, there is a clear need for ongoing national and international support to build OH research capacity through the implementation of integrated OH research programmes that are supported by education and training to strengthen these initiatives in South Asia. Most importantly, there is a need to develop sustainable research platforms within the region that can keep functioning beyond the lifespan of a single project and for continued advocacy for the OH approach to policy.",

Postgraduate OH education programmes are beginning to be offered within the region, notably the Centre for OH Education, Advocacy, Research and Training programme at Kerala University in India, the Masters of Applied Epidemiology in Sri Lanka, and the proposed OH Institute and associated OH-focused MSc at Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University in Bangladesh. The challenge is to create an OH education programme that is well-balanced and therefore attractive to both human health and animal health professionals. Joint education of professionals from different sectors is an effective way of building understanding and trust between disciplines, breaking down the barriers and misconceptions between the medical and veterinary professions. Effective OH training and education should facilitate participants towards a transdisciplinary conceptual framework that draws together disciplinary-specific theories, concepts, and approaches to address common problems. Participants' experience in Massey University's capacity-building programmes has shown that learning together in a joint postgraduate degree programme and working together in applied epidemiology projects and policy evaluation build understanding and relationships, which lay the foundation for implementing OH research and sustainable policies for managing emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases.",

            "text": "Government support for OH Formulation and implementation of policies for collaborative integrated control of zoonotic diseases in human and animal populations is strongly dependent on the formation of a government-led OH strategy and institutionalisation of OH. Formal collaborative mechanisms were established in all South Asian countries in the mid-2000s to manage emerging disease threats such as HPAI (H5N1), H1N1, and SARS. However, sustainability of these collaborations for managing endemic zoonoses in 'peace time' has been very variable. Some countries have made significant progress towards building a strong OH network and institutionalising OH, while in other countries collaboration occurs as a result of individual advocates and where it is supported by donor funding. Bangladesh is the leading South Asian country with its One Health Strategic Framework signed by the three responsible Ministers in 2012 and is making steady progress implementing the strategy, with the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee for One Health and a One Health Secretariat in June 2016. The government of Bhutan is also making good progress towards a government-led Strategic Framework for One Health, with a strategic document signed by the relevant ministers and awaiting approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. While Nepal has not yet developed a national OH strategy, the establishment of district-level OH hubs serving as a single platform for issues associated with zoonotic disease control is a significant development. Some inter-sectoral collaboration occurs in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and the collaborative networks, while largely dormant are activated and meet as and when required, but collaboration is not yet supported by a national government-led strategy. In India, the Public Health Foundation India leads initiatives and advocacy for an integrated OH approach to research and policy formulation for controlling zoonotic diseases. While national multisectoral committees have been established in India, these have not yet translated into effective collaborative research or policy formulation. In the absence of any governmental structure to support OH, collaboration in Afghanistan is still very ad hoc and largely dependent on donor-led advocacy and support.",

It is important that national and international agencies continue supporting this progress, in particular through integrated OH zoonotic disease research and education programmes that bring together professionals from different sectors over a sufficiently long period to build relationships, understanding, and respect for the roles and expertise of professionals in different sectors, generating a transdisciplinary conceptual framework to address common problems.",

A multisectoral task force was formed under the leadership of the public health authority in response to the threat of SARS in 2001. The animal and public health sectors developed an integrated National Avian Influenza Strategic Plan, approved by the Council of Ministers in 2006, involving the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development, relevant stakeholders and external development partners including United Nations agencies. Both aforementioned departments are working towards the institutionalisation of OH by developing an 'OH Strategic Framework for Nepal' with support from other development partners including FAO. The Directorate of Animal Health has initiated the establishment of 75 district-level OH hubs, providing a single platform to discuss OH issues at district level. The OH Hub, Nepal, was established in 2013 with the Directorate of Animal Health and the Epidemiology and Disease Control Department as focal points, with support from Massey University.",
