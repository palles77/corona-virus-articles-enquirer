Accompanying signs of obstruction include cough, tachypnea, accessory muscle use, hypoxemia, and, in severe cases, alteration of the mental state. Significant clinical improvement with bronchodilators or corticosteroids is required to document reversibility or, alternatively, fluctuation of symptoms spontaneously over time.",

            "text": "In infants, there is some inconsistency about the diagnostic label applied for wheeze heard on auscultation. A frequent condition in this age group is bronchiolitis-a condition that is associated with signs of a respiratory infection, predominantly, but not exclusively, associated with primary RSV infection of the lower respiratory tract. Infants with bronchiolitis typically do not display significant reversibility, either to bronchodilators or other asthma medications, and in this condition a therapeutic trial is not indicated. 13, 14 Although the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is clinical, its varied definition results in diagnostic confusion. In Canada and the United States, a diagnosis of bronchiolitis is a first episode of wheezing in children up to the age of 1 and 2 years, with lower respiratory signs that include wheeze. By contrast, in the United Kingdom and South Africa, the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is mainly limited to infants under 6 months of age, typically with fine crackles but without wheezing. 15 Consequently, wheeze in children, particularly those between 6 months and 2 years, with a first or second episode of respiratory difficulty, and no observed clinical response to asthma medication falls into a clinically unclear area, and is thus frequently labeled as \"preschool wheeze\" while awaiting a firm diagnosis. However, preschool wheeze is not a diagnosis, but only a symptom underlying an, as yet, poorly defined pathological entity. By careful observation including, when indicated, a therapeutic trial-clinicians should aim to make a definitive, if not at least a presumptive, diagnosis to apply appropriate therapy. In this regard, a therapeutic trial of asthma medication (bronchodilators with oral corticosteroids [OCS] , in case of a moderate or severe exacerbation) would be indicated in children aged 12 months and older to document reversibility.",

Indeed, a UK study reported that between 1990 and 1998, there was an increase in the prevalence of parent-reported preschool \"wheeze ever\" (from 16% to 29%), \"current wheeze\" (from 12% to 26%), \"diagnosis of asthma\" (from 11% to 19%), and \"admission for wheeze\" (from 6% to 10%). 1 This high prevalence of wheeze in preschool children results in a high burden of disease. For example, US National Surveillance of Asthma statistics 2 report the highest average annual asthma physician office visits, hospital outpatient department visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations in the preschool period than other age groups ( Fig. 44.1 )-a pattern also found in other countries. 3 Episodes of preschool wheeze are frequently associated with signs of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). 4 A wide range of infectious agents triggers these episodes (exacerbations). In a prospective cohort study done in Copenhagen, both respiratory viruses (e.g., picornaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and coronavirus) and bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated from the hypopharynx in just over half of preschool wheeze episodes. Bacteria alone were isolated in just over a third of wheeze episodes, and respiratory viruses alone were isolated in 10% of episodes. 5 In preschool children with clinically severe wheeze, human rhinovirus species C (HRVC) is often isolated, especially in those admitted to hospital. 6, 7 While an increased virulence of HRVC has been suggested for this association, 8 there is accumulating evidence that gene-environment interaction is important. For some children this may be due to genetic susceptibility. 9 In other children, allergy may be important, potentially because of impaired innate immune response leading to increased viral replication. 10",

As in adults and older children, asthma in preschool is based on recurrent (i.e., two or more) episodes of airflow obstruction and reversibility with appropriate inhaled medication. The diagnosis should be considered in children aged 12 months and older with no suspicion of another KEYWORDS preschool wheeze preschool asthma inhaled therapy ABSTRACT Wheeze in preschool children (5 years of age and younger) is common. The majority of severe episodes are triggered by viral colds. Unlike atopic asthma in adults and young people, the underlying pathology of this condition is poorly understood, and the label of \"preschool wheeze\" should therefore not be regarded as a diagnosis but a description of symptoms. It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children. Some trials suggest that preemptive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroids. Since wheeze is intermittent for the majority of children, preemptive therapy is a logical approach. However, more studies are needed to confirm whether preemptive inhaled corticosteroids are as, or more, effective than regular preventer therapy.",

When taking a history, wheeze should be separated from other respiratory sounds by asking about \"a high-pitched whistling or squeaking sound from the chest, not the throat.\" Parental reporting of wheeze cannot be regarded as the gold standard. For example, in a large population-based study, 17% of families did not define wheeze as a whistling noise, despite being given a description of wheeze in a questionnaire. 16 Showing parents a video of common respiratory signs and then asking them to identify the closest match help distinguish wheeze from other sounds such as stridor and upper airway rattles. 17 However, direct observation of signs of airflow obstruction and reversibility during an exacerbation by a trained health care professional remains the preferred approach. In a child with a prior documented exacerbation or a convincing history of an exacerbation, who does not present with clinical signs of airflow obstruction, an alternative approach is to document reversibility with a 12-week trial of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with parent-reported change in the frequency and severity of chronic and acute symptoms. This treatment should be discontinued if there is no benefit; many would want to exclude the possibility that the child had in fact recovered spontaneously by having a trial period of stopping treatment.",

Red flags for alternative diagnoses include prominent upper airway symptoms, symptoms from the first day of life, sudden onset of symptoms, chronic moist cough, symptoms worse after meals, and weight loss (Table 44 .1). 18 Examination should pay attention to clubbing, wasting, severe tonsillar hypertrophy, severe chest deformity, fixed monophonic or asymmetrical wheeze, and cardiac murmurs. A 2016 review of the diagnostic evaluation of infants with recurrent or persistent wheezing (despite adequate inhaled asthma therapy) by the American Thoracic Society recommends flexible bronchoscopy, pH monitoring, and a swallowing study; however, the evidence to support these recommendations was found to be of low quality (Table 44. 2). 19 Investigations should be tailored to the medical history, physical examination, and suspected diagnosis. For the majority of wheezy preschool children, no investigations are needed. For the minority of children with clinically very severe wheeze (and no red flags on history and examination), it is reasonable to perform a chest radiograph and assess the possibility of sensitization to outdoor and indoor allergens as contributing factors.

            "text": "The first complete picture of the natural history of preschool wheeze originated from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study. 21 Retrospective analysis of this longitudinal dataset from 1246 newborns assessed at both 3 years and 6 years revealed distinct temporal patterns of wheeze that were associated with different factors. First, there are \"transient infant wheezers\" (the majority of wheezers in this cohort) who wheezed occasionally during the first 3 years of life and then did not wheeze after the age of 3 years. This pattern was not significantly associated with markers of atopy, such as blood eosinophilia or high levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), but was associated with lower lung function (measured in infants prior to their first episode of wheezing) and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Although many of these preschoolers probably met the definition of preschool asthma (obstruction and reversibility with asthma therapy), this pattern was not significantly associated with parentreported ongoing asthma symptoms at and beyond 6 years of age, suggesting a transient asthma phenomenon. Second, there were \"nonatopic wheezers\" who begin wheezing at 3 years, but whose wheeze resolved by 6 years. Third, there are \"atopic wheezers,\" whose preschool wheeze continued as allergic asthma after 6 years of age. Similar trajectories of preschool wheeze have subsequently been reported in other longitudinal cohorts, albeit with subtle differences. For example, an analysis of longitudinal data from the Leicestershire and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohorts found patterns consistent between the two cohorts. Those children with persistent wheeze and chronic cough, associated with atopy, have reduced lung function and a poorer prognosis, whereas those with early-onset nonpersistent wheeze have a more favorable prognosis. 22 To date, however, these important epidemiological studies have not produced a clinically useful method for predicting which preschool children will develop asthma symptoms at school age. Indeed, a systematic review of 12 asthma prediction models, including the asthma predictive index (API), found that although some models were better at predicting ongoing asthma at 6 years, and other models were better at ruling it out, no single model could accurately do both. 23 Thus the prediction of whether preschoolers with asthmalike symptoms will continue to have asthma at 6 years, from contemporaneously obtained information, cannot be achieved with sufficient precision in a large proportion of preschool children with wheeze. One main reason is that most children have symptoms only in preschool years and \"outgrow\" symptoms before the age of 6 years, although, unfortunately, some still have residual lung function impairment. 24 Another reason is the different prevalence of disease in various settings, such as the general population, a family physician practice, or a specialist clinic. When discussing outcomes with parents, clinicians therefore should make it clear that (1) wheezing is very common in the first few years of life, (2) there is a good chance that wheeze will resolve by school age and only a minority of affected children will become lifelong asthmatics, and (3) there is an increased chance of exhibiting ongoing asthma symptoms at school age if wheeze continues beyond 3 years of age, and particularly if it is associated with allergies, although accurate prediction of outcome is not possible. phenotypes within the same child over time and high betweenphysician variability. 29, 31 Clearly, significant progress in personalized medicine hinges on the future identification of accurate, precise, and reproducible determinants of response, such as preschool lung function, inflammatory markers, genotype, metabolomics, and other \"omics\" obtainable in preschool children. Stratification on these determinants must then be proven to be associated with differential treatment response, in randomized clinical trials.",

A second meta-analysis of trials not included in the Castro-Rodriguez and Rodrigo review (noted previously) done by Ducharme et al 42 pertained to a mixed population of preschoolers with or without atopy (or a positive API); again, daily ICS was found to reduce the risk of moderate exacerbations (i.e., exacerbations needing rescue OCS) by more than 40%, compared with placebo (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40-0.80) and was associated with a significantly greater percentage of asthma-free days (mean difference [MD] 5.52 days, 95% CI 2.22-8.81). However, daily ICS therapy is not curative and must be sustained to maintain benefit. For example, during the 1-year period after the cessation of ICS in the Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids (PEAK) trial, there was a similar frequency of symptoms in ICS-and placebotreated children. 43 Only two pediatric trials have compared daily LTRAs to placebo in preschoolers.

While shown effective in all age groups, 37 the only randomized trial that tested an educational guided selfmanagement approach exclusively in preschoolers did not show a significant difference from usual care. 38 However, the authors recognized substantial contamination between groups, with close to half of control patients recalling that they received the same verbal instructions as those in the intervention; further, they acknowledged the absence of documented effectiveness of their recommended interventionnamely preemptive home administration of oral steroids in viral-induced wheezing. Given these study limitations, asthma self-management education remains indicated in preschoolers. 11 Avoidance of exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritants, and if sensitized, to aeroallergens, should be recommended. Although respiratory illnesses are the most frequent triggers, there is currently no proven, effective approach to avoid the common cold, other than reduced exposure to infected individuals.

The wide confidence interval (see Fig.  44 .3B) underlines the lack of power to draw firm conclusions about the relative efficacy of daily low doses versus preemptive high-doses of ICS. 42 However, daily ICS trials included a variety of children with interim symptoms, atopy, or recurrent viral-induced asthma, such that this approach appears as the most effective first-line therapy irrespective of apparent phenotype and is recommended as such by most national and international guidelines. 12, 36, 57, 58 By contrast, preemptive high-dose ICS was tested in younger preschool children with moderate or severe viral-induced wheezing with no or minimal interim symptoms, such that this approach may be best reserved to those with two or more exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or rescue OCS, who failed to respond to daily ICS. 12 Because of the risk of ICS overuse by parents and physicians, the preemptive high-dose suspected explanations for the negative findings. 74 By contrast, a recent cohort study conducted in children aged 1-17 years presenting with a moderate or severe asthma exacerbation and treated with a severity-specific treatment protocol with \u03b22-agonists, ipratropium bromide, and OCS reported a very low treatment failure rate of 17%. 75 After adjusting for baseline severity (i.e., PRAM score and oxygen saturation), the presence of symptoms between exacerbations, viral detection, and fever were significant predictors of failure of emergency management. Of note, age was not significantly associated with treatment response. These data suggest that a higher rate of respiratory infections, rather than age, may explain the apparent higher treatment failure observed in preschoolers presenting with acute asthma.

Since improvement of symptoms with azithromycin may be due to an improvement in (clinically trivial) bronchitic cough, and not wheeze, 79 azithromycin cannot be recommended at this time.",

This may imply finding novel strategies to prevent key triggers such as viral infections, to reduce the frequency and severity of viral-induced exacerbations, and to improve the monitoring of preschool lung function to identify \"unrecognized\" persistent airway obstruction. Although there are no long-term trials to determine if sustained controller therapy introduced early could prevent lung function impairment in school-aged children with asthma symptoms, it seems prudent to initiate controller therapy early.",

A proven effective alternative for children with moderate and severe viral-induced exacerbations is preemptive high-dose ICS, with safeguards to prevent overuse by parents and physicians. Future advances in objective markers of phenotype would enable major advances in personalized therapy. Trials are needed to clarify the role of adjunct therapy and immunotherapy in this young age group. Meanwhile, careful regular reassessments remain the cornerstone of an appropriate follow-up to ensure an adequate response and enable timely reduction to the minimal effective dose. obstruction and who meet the criteria for asthma is scarce; consequently, it remains debated whether one should restrict or liberalize its use in preschool children with ongoing wheeze, despite an initial adequate dose of inhaled bronchodilator therapy. By contrast, children who are younger than a year, with a first episode of wheezing, who do not meet the operational definition of asthma (obstruction and reversibility with asthma medication) are unlikely to benefit from OCS, irrespective of severity or setting. In children falling between these two extremes, OCS should be used sparingly and on an individual trial basis only.",

Although promising, the evidence is thus insufficient to recommend replacing oral steroids by highdose ICS therapy (which is also more costly), either in emergency management, or upon discharge from the emergency department. 76",
