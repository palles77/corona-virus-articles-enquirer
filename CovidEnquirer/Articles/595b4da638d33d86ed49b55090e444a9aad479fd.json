Murine monoclonal and sheep polyclonal antibodies (mAbs and pAbs) to feline IFN-g (fIFN-g) were generated firstly to facilitate further research into the role of cellular immune responses in the control of feline infectious disease, and secondly to enable evaluation of the efficacy of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. A hybridoma clone, D9, secreting IgG1 antibodies was selected for expansion and the mAbs affinity purified in vitro. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in a sheep against recombinant fIFN-g and affinity purified. The sensitivity of the D9 mAb and the sheep anti-fIFN-g pAb was determined using an indirect fIFN-g enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots. These antibodies were assessed for their ability to detect the production of fIFN-g by specific feline T cell populations ex vivo following coculture with mitogen or feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigens for 4 h in the presence of the protein secretion inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). Production of fIFN-g was evaluated using flow cytometry to simultaneously detect PE-labelled surface molecules and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled intracellular fIFN-g. Using this approach, our initial studies revealed an upregulation in virus-specific fIFN-g-secreting CD4 + T cells in the lymph nodes of FeLV latently infected cats. D",

Feline immunodeficiency virus infection of domestic cats is also recognised as an important animal model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine development (Willett et al., 1997) . Currently, effective vaccines are not available for the majority of these feline infections, and curative treatment is often not possible. A concerted effort to develop feline-specific reagents has facilitated an improved understanding of the immune mechanisms that determine the disease outcome following exposure to these feline pathogens Flynn et al., 1996; Paltrinieri et al., 1998; Flynn et al., 2002) . However, progress in this area is slow.

These cats developed a transient viraemia subsequent to oronasal exposure to FeLV, after which it was no longer possible to isolate FeLV from the blood.

These highly sensitive assays will enable the evolution of the immune response to be monitored following infection or following vaccination. Early Gag/Pro-specific CD8 + CTL effector responses are associated with recovery from FeLV infection (Flynn et al., 2002) . Therefore, the capacity of virus-specific CD4 + T cells to activate CD8 + T cells through the production of cytokines such as IFN-g should be a key factor in the control of viraemia (Rosenberg et al., 1997) . Our initial studies reveal that p27-specific and p45-specific CD4 + T cells reside in the lymph nodes of latently infected cats. Stimulation with recombinant p27 and p45 proteins caused an upregulation of fIFN-g production in a proportion of CD4 + T cells compared to unstimulated CD4 + T cells.",
