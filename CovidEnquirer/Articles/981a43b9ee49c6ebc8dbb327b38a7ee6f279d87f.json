Additional assessment tools of the faculty development program are recommended to evaluate different perspectives of outcome. Our experience suggests that OSTEs are a realistic and well-received approach for faculty development that merits further investigation. According to the clinical instructors' response, our faculty development program effectively increased familiarity with various teaching and assessment skills needed to teach PGY 1 residents and ACGME competencies, and these clinical instructors also then subsequently applied these skills.",

The problem-based curriculum utilizes clinical scenarios with emphasis on problem solving. Each session of discussion is based on a patient's clinical records and involves integration of basic science knowledge and clinical management. The National University of Taiwan was the first university in Taiwan to introduce the problem-based curriculum into its own curriculum in 1990 and other universities subsequently followed. The integrated courses are either based on organ systems or a patient's clinical problem. In addition, medical education on ethics and humanity has also gained importance in our country, with implementation of courses to explore related issues such as euthanasia and surrogate mothers [2, 4] .",

Although this system offered adequate specialty or subspecialty training in medical knowledge, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, medical treatment or surgical procedures, it did not emphasize caring for the patient's psychological and social issues. In addition, due to the lack of interaction and cooperation between different specialists, it was difficult for each physician to be aware of the patient's overall condition; hence, patient-centered medicine and integrated medical care were not achieved.

For those who already excel in clinical teaching, the program can enhance the quality of teaching and introduce new effective teaching behaviors and concepts of medical education.

In addition, the influence from policies stipulated by Taiwan's National Health Insurance system, the evolution of the medical education system, and the trend of globalization had a significant impact on students' clinical learning, selection of specialization, and meeting social expectations of the medical profession. The development of technology and internationalization also changed the learning behavior of medical students; therefore, clinician-teachers needed to be multifaceted, perceptive of society, and aware of students' learning rights, in order to cope with the rapidly changing society [2] . Consequently, it became vital to raise incentives for participation in faculty development training and establish a good reward system. Institutes should attend to clinician-teachers' needs and difficulties, create a good teaching environment, and promote motivation. In addition, additional training courses should be offered and more opportunities to pursue degrees in medical education should be provided [14, 15] .",
