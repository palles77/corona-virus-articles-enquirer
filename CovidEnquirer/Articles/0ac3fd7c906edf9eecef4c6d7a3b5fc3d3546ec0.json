One is the ability of antibody to protect against infection when it is present before or immediately following infection. The other is the ability of antibody to interfere with an established infection. There is good reason to make this distinction because there is strong evidence that antibody is effective against many different viruses in a protective role, but there is more ambiguity about a role in ongoing infection. The distinction may have its origins, at least in part, in the activity of antibody against propagation of infection by free virus compared to its activity against propagation via cell-to-cell spread. Evidence for a number of viruses in vitro indicates that lower antibody concentrations are required to inhibit infection propagated by free virus than are required to inhibit infection propagated by cell-to-cell spread.",

The activity against virions most often considered is neutralization, which can be defined as the loss of infectivity which ensues when antibody molecule(s) bind to a virus particle, and usually occurs without the involvement of any other agency. As such this is an unusual activity of antibody paralleled only by the inhibition of toxins and enzymes Dimmock, 1995 Antibody-dependent complement-mediated virolysis is also an activity directed against free virions. Antibodies can also bind to viral products on infected cells to trigger effector functions, including activation of complement and ADCC. Antibody-mediated phagocytosis can be directed against free virions as well as some infected cells. In addition, the binding of antibody to infected cells has been proposed to inhibit intracellular viral replication in certain cases. We begin by considering the in vitro antiviral activities of antibody.",

To explain single-hit neutralization of viruses in cases where a number of antibody molecules are bound to a virus particle at the neutralization event [e.g., 4 antibody molecules per virion to poliovirus or 70 per virion in the case of influenza A (see below, and Icenogle et al., 1983; Taylor et al., 1987) ], antibody-induced conformational changes of the viral capsid (Mandel, 1976) or the existence of antigenically identical \"neutralization-relevant\" and \"neutralization-irrelevant\" antibody binding sites on the virion surface have been proposed (Icenogle et al., 1983; Taylor et al., 1987) . The myriad of proposed neutralization mechanisms, however, are somewhat difficult to reconcile with the nature of antibody generation and selection. Antibodies are superb binding molecules selected for highaffinity binding rather than for their ability to induce critical conformational changes in viral capsid proteins or envelope spikes.",

            "text": "In this review, we propose a much more simplistic and unifying mechanism for neutralization. We suggest that neutralizing antibodies generally act by coating the surface of a pathogen, and that neutralized pathogens represent entities on which this coating has reached a critical density. This antibody coat then prevents the pathogen from interacting properly with the target cell, thereby interfering with the initiation of a productive infection. Differential effects of the antibody coat on distinct viruses, such as inhibition of attachment, viral entry, or apparent post entry effects, may be due to the epitope being recognized, but also may in part be explained by differences in virus biology rather than by the direct induction of specific events by the antibody. The mechanism suggests that so-called \"neutralizing\" and \"nonneutralizing\" epitopes do not exist as distinct entities on the viral surface, as has been suggested in the past (e.g., Dimmock, 1993) . Neutralizing epitopes generally represent antibody-accessible structures on the virion surface which are present in a valence high enough that a critical antibody density, as will be calculated below, can be achieved. Low-density epitopes do not represent true nonneutralizing epitopes, as critical density could be achieved by a combination of two or more antibodies against several distinct low-density epitopes. Neo-epitopes which may exist only transiently on virions, for example during virus-target cell fusion, do not necessarily form an exception to the model discussed above. In our view, antibodies against such epitopes will only be neutralizing if the neo-epitope is accessible to antibody at some point during the virus infection process so that effective coating can occur.",

Therefore, antibody binding to virions may be a useful indicator of in vivo activity. In reality, the measurement of antibody binding to virions is often technically demanding. Furthermore, for many virus preparations, infectious particle:total particle ratios are low, introducing an element of uncertainty with regard to envelope homogeneity. Therefore, measurement of binding to envelope at the surface of infected cells has often been preferred. It should be noted, though, that some viruses express nonstructural or modified viral proteins on the infected-cell surface but not on virions. Such (non-neutralizing) antibodies are ineffective against free virus, but may be able to protect against viral infection in vivo by mediating the destruction of infected cells. This will be discussed in more detail below.",

However, problems can arise with the measurement of binding to envelope on cell surfaces. It is important to minimize these problems as much as possible by proper experimental design. First, envelope spikes such as those of HIV-1 can shed protein, providing opportunities for observation of antibodies that apparently bind well to the infected cell surface but do not bind to functional envelope spikes. Some antibodies against the HIV-1 transmembrane (TM) unit gp41 probably fall in to this category, as they may bind to inactivated envelope spikes in which gp41 is exposed, following shedding of the surface unit (SU) gp120. A second type of artifact in HIV-1 is provided by antibody binding to shed gp120 in interaction with the primary HIV-1 receptor CD4; antibodies apparently bind to the cells, but this does not reflect binding to envelope spikes. This is significant, as many nonneutralizing epitopes which are not accessible on the oligomeric HIV-1 envelope spike are exposed on monomeric gp120 Parren et al., 1999) . A third type of artifact may arise if envelope is overexpressed, for example, by expression of recombinant envelope glycoprotein under the control of a strong promotor. Thus it seems clear that the unprocessed HIV-1 envelope precursor glycoprotein gp160 can be expressed at cell surfaces under certain conditions (e.g., Dubay et al., 1995; Karlsson et al., 1996) . Since many antibodies that do not bind to envelope spikes bind well to unprocessed gp160, there is again an opportunity for erroneous conclusions (Parren et al., 1997b) .",

The answer to the question has a number of important ramifications. If many antibodies that bind to envelope spikes do not neutralize, then binding is not necessarily a good indicator for likely antiviral efficacy. Further, there are implications for vaccine design. If all antibodies that bind also neutralize, then the envelope spike has the antigenic properties of an ideal vaccine candidate. On the other hand, if the envelope spike can induce nonneutralizing antibodies, it may not be an optimal antigen. In particular, the induction of nonneutralizing antibodies that can bind to envelope spikes and inhibit the binding of neutralizing antibodies would be undesirable.",

We argue that overwhelmingly there is a good correlation between neutralization and virion binding with few exceptions. Our own experience in studies on human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to HIV-1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and Ebola virus, has been that there is an excellent correlation between binding to envelope spikes and neutralization, which in these studies was measured as binding to infected cells. We have generally seen a close correlation between half-maximal antibody binding and antibody concentration required to give 50% neutralization, suggesting that neutralization is directly related to occupancy of sites on the virion. For HIV-1, neutralization is incremental with increasing antibody occupancy, irrespective of the epitope recognized, leading to increased inhibition of infectivity (Parren et al., 1998; Sch\u00f8nning et al., 1999) . This issue is discussed in much greater detail below.",

Great advances in understanding of the inactivation of viruses by antibody were then made in the early twentieth century. In a prominent article, Burnet and colleagues reviewed the state-ofthe-art of antibody neutralization in 1937 (Burnet et al., 1937) . They argued that neutralization studies of bacteriophage, plant, and animal viruses showed that generally (i) neutralization was reversible, and (ii) more than one antibody was required for neutralization. Based on studies with a number of animal viruses including vaccinia and influenza, they summarized: \"virus and antibody combined reversibly, and that the infectivity or otherwise of a given virus particle was determined by the amount of antibody united to it at the time of effective contact with the susceptible cell.\" Reversibility indicated that the \"union of antibody has no intrinsic inactivating effect on the virus.\" The conclusions that neutralization is reversible and requires the binding of multiple antibody molecules to the virion have since been disputed (and rediscovered) in many later publications. In particular, the observation of single-hit kinetics in a number of experimental systems has been interpreted as evidence for neutralization by the binding of a single antibody to a critical site on the virion.",

This was plausible, as neutralizing antibodies bind to the tail-plate of the phage, an essential component in the infective process, and the width of the tail-plate is similar to the length of an antibody molecule (Jerne and Avegno, 1956 ). An influential study which sharply contradicted the conclusions by Burnet et al. (1937) was published by Dulbecco and colleagues also in 1956, who analyzed 201 neutralization of Western equine encephalitis virus (WEE) and poliovirus by specific antisera (Dulbecco et al., 1956) . It was found that curves describing the logarithm of virus survival as a function of time generally did not display an initial shoulder or lag time, which was interpreted as neutralization following first-order kinetics. After an initial time period, however, the slope of the curves decreased, eventually becoming horizontal, which indicated the existence of a persistent and apparently neutralization-resistant fraction of virus. Dissociation of poliovirus-antibody complexes could not be observed, and there was only a very slight dissociation of WEE-antibody complexes. It was concluded that the attachment of a single neutralizing antibody molecule to a critical site is sufficient to inactivate a virus particle and that neutralization is irreversible (Dulbecco et al., 1956) .",

            "text": "However, not all results in the manuscript by Dulbecco et al. could be explained by the neutralization model they developed. First, a clear lag time of WEE neutralization was observed when kinetic neutralization experiments were performed at temperatures lower than 37 \u2022 C. Even at 37 \u2022 C, Dulbecco et al. noted that a small lag time may exist, although the experimental conditions used may have made detection difficult. Furthermore, multiplicity curves, which describe the logarithm of virus survival as a function of increasing antibody concentration, did not follow theoretical curves based on the model; experimental curves bent upward at high antibody concentration rather than downward. This deviation could not be completely explained by the persistent virus fraction. The authors concluded that different fractions may be present in the challenge stock consisting of virions with a different number of critical sites or unequal distribution of critical sites (Dulbecco et al., 1956) . Krummel and Uhr (1969) recognized that the critical site neutralization models developed often did not fit the data at later time points during the course of neutralization in kinetic experiments. They argued that, for a highly symmetrical virus with a surface array of repeated coat-protein subunits such as the bacteriophage X174 studied, it was likely that multiple antibody molecules were required for neutralization. Kinetic neutralization experiments, in which residual infectivity was assessed using two different methods, indeed indicated that bacteriophage covered with antibody may retain its infectivity. Significantly, they observed an apparent faster neutralization rate if residual infectivity was assessed using a decision tube method rather than the conventional direct plating method. In a kinetic neutralization experiment, antibody and phage are mixed, and samples, drawn at multiple time points, are incubated with bacteria and plated to assess residual infectivity. In the decision tube method, an excess of additional neutralizing antiserum is added a short time after adding the reaction sample to the bacteria. Whereas infectious titers determined with both methods were similar prior to the addition of neutralizing antibody, the decision tube method measured markedly decreased infectious titers compared to the 202 PARREN AND BURTON conventional plating method at time points after the addition of antibody. As neutralization of X174 phage was effectively irreversible under the conditions used, the difference observed could not be explained by the prevention of reactivation of neutralized phage (e.g., by dissociation of antibody-virus complexes). A plausible explanation is that some phage are partially coated with antibody molecules but not neutralized, and these phage infect bacteria at a slower rate than naked phage. A similar delay in the initiation of bacteriophage-induced lysis in neutralization experiments has previously been interpreted to indicate that partially antibody-coated but infectious phage particles exist (reviewed in Burnet et al., 1937) . By entering an infectivity function for such phage-antibody complexes into the mathematical model developed by Krummel and Uhr (1969) , the model better matched their data. This clearly indicated that the observed reaction rates of neutralizing antibody with bacteriophage were not first order, even under conditions of antibody excess (Krummel and Uhr, 1969) .",

            "text": "Neutralization of poliovirus has been studied extensively. Dulbecco et al. (1956) argued that neutralization of poliovirus is irreversible and follows firstorder kinetics as discussed. Studies performed by Mandel (1961) confirmed that reactivation of virus infectivity after dilution of antibody-virus complexes could not be demonstrated in measurements taken over several months. The apparent irreversibility of the reaction appeared to be due, however, to a very tight binding of antibody to poliovirus rather than the induction of permanent changes in the viral particles, as it was demonstrated that neutralizing rabbit antibody could be eluted from poliovirions at low pH accompanied by quantitative reactivation of virus activity (Mandel, 1961) . Mandel (1976) found that the capsid protein of poliovirus may exist in two conformational states, characterized by distinct isoelectric points: state A, with an isoelectric point of about 7, and state B, with an isoelectric point of about 4.5. Neutralizing antibody was found to stabilize the virion in state B. Mandel proposed that binding of neutralizing antibody locked the viral capsid in a noninfectious conformation by rendering it resistant to uncoating following its adsorption to the target cell. Single-hit kinetics in poliovirus neutralization could be explained by the induction of a generalized molecular rearrangement in the viral capsid after binding of a single antibody to a critical site on the capsid molecule. The mechanism is feasible, as the poliovirus capsid 203 is a closely packed structure making conformational cooperativity among capsid subunits a possibility (Mandel, 1976) . However, the relationship between the conformational state and infectivity was not complete, as infectious virus in the B state could be detected, particularly at low antibody multiplicity (even after subtracting the infectivity assigned to the small fraction of virus naturally occurring in the B state) (Mandel, 1976) . A correlation between binding of neutralizing antibody to poliovirus and a shift in isoelectric point has generally held up in studies with monoclonal antibodies (Emini et al., 1983a) , although exceptions have been noted (Brioen et al., 1985; Emini et al., 1983a) .",

However, in this case it is particularly clear that the induced conformational changes do not play a major role in picornavirus neutralization (reviewed in Hewat and Blaas, 2001; Smith, 2001) . The most convincing data come from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography of virus-antibody complexes which show that rhinovirus can be neutralized without the induction of large conformational changes in the virion capsid (Hewat and Blaas, 1996; Smith, 2001; Smith et al., 1993 Smith et al., , 1996 . Furthermore, as the change in isoelectric point has been observed following binding of a large number of different antibodies against a range of epitopes on rhinovirus, it appears unlikely that all these antibodies would induce a common conformational change required for neutralization. The most likely hypothesis is that the changes in isoelectric point are the result of changes occurring in exposed highly flexible portions of the capsid proteins rather than structural rearrangement of the viral capsid (Che et al., 1998; Smith, 2001) . Although, being the result of the binding of neutralizing antibody, these changes are probably mostly irrelevant to the mechanism of neutralization itself.",

Particular insight into the relationship between antibody bound to poliovirus and neutralization was provided by Philipson and colleagues (1966) who developed an aqueous polymer phase system to study the interaction between neutralizing antibody and poliovirus. It was found that virions complexed with antibody could be separated from free virions by adding a polymer to the mixture, followed by a simple phase-separation technique. The phase system was more sensitive in detecting antibody binding to the virion compared to conventional neutralization tests, clearly indicating that neutralizing antibody was bound to the virions before neutralization could be detected. Interestingly, binding titers in the phase system method were 2-4 times greater than the serum neutralization titers against poliovirus . The significance of this number will become clear shortly. Additional studies by Philipson on the interaction of antibody with poliovirus using countercurrent distribution, furthermore, showed that at low antibody input, virion-antibody complexes separated from free virus retained infectivity (Philipson, 1966) .",

Icenogle et al. (1983) determined the neutralizing dose for poliovirus in a study using radiolabeled virus and antibody, and demonstrated that the binding of an average of 4-5 antibody molecules to a poliovirus particle resulted in neutralization. Two neutralization models were proposed to explain these results in the context of first-order kinetics: a critical site hypothesis, in which binding to one out of four sites on the virus leads to neutralization, and a stepwise model, in which binding to each site reduces infectivity by 3/4. Both models, however, are in conflict with the studies by Philipson et al. (1966) , discussed above, which demonstrated that antibody binding to virions can be detected prior to neutralization. Significantly, the observation that an occupancy of 4-5 antibody molecules per virion is required for neutralization is consistent with the observed differences in binding and neutralization titers in the Philipson studies. The most straightforward conclusion is that the single-hit hypothesis of poliovirus neutralization is not correct, and that the mechanism of neutralization of poliovirus is similar to that of HRV.",

            "text": "The overall architecture of poliovirus and HRV are similar, and both viruses have similar proportions consisting of a 30-nm-diameter capsid surrounding the positive-strand RNA genome. The three-dimensional structure of poliovirus in complex with a soluble form of its receptor (CD155) has recently been solved (Belnap et al., 2000; He et al., 2000) . The poliovirus receptor CD155 has a footprint similar to that observed for the rhinovirus receptor ICAM-1 bound to Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. HRV. Both bind to the canyon, a narrow surface depression on the viral surface. It may therefore not be completely surprising that the stoichiometrical analyses discussed above yield similar results for HRV and poliovirus. The data suggest that the attachment of 4-7 antibody molecules is required for the neutralization of picornaviruses of poliovirus/HRV dimensions. Studies by Horaud and colleagues (Blondel et al., 1986; Crainic et al., 1983; Diamond et al., 1985) have suggested that antibodies may bind to poliovirus without neutralization. This conclusion was made on the basis of studies using neutralizing antibodies which were analyzed for their activity (neutralization and binding) against a range of antigenic poliovirus variants (distinct serotypes and escape mutants). For example, some serotypes appeared to be bound by antibody in an immunoprecipitation assay but were not neutralized. The studies, however, made no distinction between strong and weak binding. Mutations on poliovirus envelope in or near the antibody binding site may result in decreased antibody affinity for the poliovirus mutants in question, resulting in a level of occupancy too low to neutralize the virus (for example, as shown by the studies discussed above). This interpretation is supported by the observation that addition of antiantibody in the studies above did result in neutralization of the mutant viruses (Blondel et al., 1986) , presumably because anti-antibody effectively increases affinity (avidity) and raises occupancy to the level required for neutralization (see below).",

            "text": "Single-hit models are based on the observation that infectivity starts to decrease immediately following addition of antibody to virus. The absence of a detectable lag phase, i.e., a period in which infectivity remains unaffected following antibody addition, has often been taken as supporting evidence for the single-hit model (Dulbecco et al., 1956; Icenogle et al., 1983; Mandel, 1976; McLain and Dimmock, 1994; Taylor et al., 1987) . It may be argued, however, that reactions of antibodies of nanomolar affinities for their cognate antigen occur rapidly (e.g., Scicluna and McCullough, 1999) , and as samples are being drawn in kinetic studies at intervals of minutes or greater, it may not be possible to measure the surviving virus fraction fast enough to observe the presence or absence of a lag phase under standard conditions (Della-Porte and Westaway, 1977) . Furthermore, lag times in neutralization kinetics have indeed been observed in studies with most viruses when the experiments were performed at lower incubation temperature, more dilute antibody concentration, or with antibodies of lower affinity (Burnet et al., 1937; Dulbecco et al., 1956; Lafferty, 1963a; Philipson, 1966; Taylor et al., 1987) . This is difficult to reconcile with the single-hit model, as it requires the assumption that the mechanism of 206 PARREN AND BURTON neutralization changes as temperature, antibody concentration, or affinity are varied. Klasse and Moore (1996, and references therein) have argued that a firstorder neutralization reaction does not give direct proof for neutralization by single-hit kinetics. One antibody molecule neutralizing one virion implies firstorder kinetics, but the reverse is not true. Stoichiometrical analyses (see below) suggest that the binding of more than one antibody molecule to a virus particle is usually required for neutralization. An alternative explanation for the absence of a lag phase to the one discussed above, at least for enveloped viruses, may be found in a heterogeneity of spike density. In virus stocks, virions may exist with a low number of active spikes that may only require one or a few hits for neutralization (Klasse and Moore, 1996) . HIV-1 is an example where this hypothesis may be applicable, as shedding of gp120 from the virion results in the formation of inactive spikes .",

Indeed, dissociation may play a role when low-affinity 207 antibody preparations are being used, and dissociation of the virus-antibody complexes occurs before or during the addition of the complexes to the target cell (Jerne and Avegno, 1956; Lafferty, 1963b) . With high-affinity antibody preparations, however, this does not seem to be an important factor (Dulbecco et al., 1956) . It has also been suggested that a low-affinity antibody or nonneutralizing antibody may bind to the virion, preventing the binding of neutralizing antibody and giving rise to a nonneutralizable fraction. In some cases, however, such a fraction is more easily explained in terms of heterogeneity of the virus preparation. Vaccinia virus and rabbitpox virus preparations, for example, contain a small fraction of extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) in an excess of intracellular mature virus (IMV). The EEV contains an additional wrapping membrane and is relatively resistant to neutralization (Ichihashi, 1996; Vanderplasschen et al., 1997) . The wrapping membrane however is easily damaged during manipulations thereby exposing the more-neutralization sensitive IMV particle (Ichihashi, 1996; Vanderplasschen et al., 1997) . This mechanism, rather than dissociation of low-affinity or nonneutralizing antibody, may explain experiments that show that the persistent fraction in rabbitpox virus can be neutralized following dilution and washing (Lafferty, 1963a) .",

Krummel and Uhr (1969) demonstrated reduced infectivity rates for bacteriophages complexed with neutralizing antibody in kinetic neutralization experiments (see above). Westaway (1965) further noted that the rate of penetration of West Nile virus preincubated with neutralizing antibody was delayed, as the virus was susceptible to postattachment neutralization for a longer period of time after adsorption to target cells than nonsensitized virus.

Enhancement is very sensitive to the target cell and is dependent on the types and expression levels of Fc and/or complement receptors on the target cell surface. A classical example is enhancement of dengue virus infection, which is dependent on the interaction between virion-bound antibody and Fc receptors expressed on the target cell. In typical assays, neutralization is observed at relatively high concentrations, whereas enhancement is observed at lower concentrations. Using neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus, Morens et al. (1987) indeed showed that the mAb concentration maximizing enhancement was predicted by the neutralization titer. Hawkes and Lafferty (1967) noted that the balance between enhancement and neutralization is dependent on the incubation time of virus and antibody. They observed a shift of the dose response curve as time progressed, and enhancement as well as neutralization occurred at increasingly lower concentrations. Presumably, at early time points, attachment of a small number of antibodies leads to enhancement, and as the reaction progresses, more antibodies attach, eventually leading to neutralization of the virion. This clearly indicates that enhancement and neutralization are two different biological outcomes of the interaction of an antibody with virus at different levels of occupancy.",

In Fc receptor-mediated enhancement, Fc receptormediated endocytosis of virion-antibody complexes may lead to the internalization of virus and infection. A plausible alternative is that binding to Fc receptors ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF ANTIBODIES 209 stabilizes the interaction of virion and target-cell, permitting interaction of the envelope spike and virus receptor at low antibody coating of the virion (Connor et al., 1991) . At higher coating, this interaction may be inhibited. Complement receptor 2 (CD21) may mediate enhancement of HIV-1 infection via several proposed mechanisms, either by acting as a receptor for HIV-1 opsonized with antibody and complement or by increasing virus binding to the cell due to an interaction of CD21 with opsonized virus (Boyer et al., 1992; Lund et al., 1995) . In addition, virion-bound C1q may directly interact with receptors on the host cell, leading to enhancement of infection (Prohaszka et al., 1997) . In some cases, such as HIV-1, the enhancement does not require the Fc part of the antibody molecule (Sullivan et al., 1998b) . It is suggested that the low-level coating may trigger conformational changes in the envelope that, for example, favor fusion between the virion and target cell, or such coating may nonspecifically reduce repulsion between the virion and target cell surface.

These are relatively poorly neutralized by single specificity antisera against each of the parent viruses, but are more effectively neutralized by mixed neutralizing antisera. Cells dually infected with the myxovirus fowl plaque virus (FPV) and the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) produced a virus progeny of which about 20% was composed of virus particles with mixed envelopes. Neutralization of virions carrying mixed envelopes was poor to nonexistent in neutralization assays with anti-VSV and anti-FPV alone. However, strong neutralization occurred when the assay was carried out with a mixture of the two sera (Zavada and Rosenbergova, 1972) .

The persistent fraction appeared to be bound by neutralizing mAb, as it was almost completely neutralized by the addition of anti-antibody (Iorio and Bratt, 1984) . It did not seem to contain large aggregates of virus or genotypically distinct viruses (Iorio and Bratt, 1984) . Interestingly, the persistent fraction could be neutralized when antibodies against several epitopes on the HN glycoprotein were combined and, in addition, a level of neutralization comparable to a polyclonal immune serum could only be obtained by combining antibodies against four distinct epitopes on NDV Bratt, 1983, 1984) . These observations are consistent with some heterogeneity of the NDV HN glycoprotein which may exist in different conformations on the virion surface. Neutralization of La Crosse virus to the level of a polyclonal antibody could similarly only be obtained with combinations of two monoclonal antibodies against the G1 glycoprotein (Kingsford, 1984) .

Cryo-EM of adenovirus complexed with the Fab indicates that the Fab may occupy all five RGD epitopes on the penton base complex. The whole IgG molecule was shown to bind soluble penton base with a stoichiometry of 2.8, indicating that, per penton base, two IgG molecules may bind bivalently and one monovalently.

The number of antibody molecules bound per rabies virus particle was determined carefully and correlated with the magnitude of neutralization achieved. It was found that infectivity was completely preserved with fewer than 130 IgG or 30 IgM molecules bound per virion (Flamand et al., 1993) . The neutralizing dose, the dose at which infectivity is decreased to 37% (1/e), was between 130 and 320 IgG (40 to 50 IgM) molecules bound per virion depending on the antibody tested.

Two of these were subsequently shown to bind to a minor population of envelope spikes in an altered acidic conformation of envelope (Raux et al., 1995) . Coating of the virion via this altered spike was too incomplete to permit neutralization. If the virion was maintained at lower pH to convert most spikes to the acidic form, then more antibody bound, and the virus was neutralized. One mAb, which effectively neutralized wild-type virus, appeared to saturate the envelope spikes of a neutralization escape variant (1080 molecules of IgG per virion) but did not neutralize it. The antibody-coated virus was still able to attach to target cells. The authors considered it unlikely that this attachment was occurring through envelope, because of the thickness of the antibody shell coating the virus (Flamand et al., 1993) . This case appears to constitute a bona fide example of virion coating by antibody without neutralization. Although it is the rabies mutant virus rather than the antibody that seems be an exception to the rule here, it would be very interesting to elucidate how this mutant virus can escape neutralization while being completely coated with antibody.",

Neutralization was studied 212 PARREN AND BURTON using T-cell line adapted (TCLA) HIV-1 isolates. The strategy adopted was to compare the binding of a number of antibodies to different gp120 epitopes, presented in the form of functional oligomeric gp120 on infected cells, with their capacity to neutralize the corresponding virus. A concentration of mAb yielding half-maximal binding (K 50 ) and a neutralization titer (ID 50 ) of similar magnitude would be consistent with antibody occupancy of virion binding sites playing a major role in HIV-1 neutralization. Similar K 50 /ID 50 ratios for different epitopes would suggest that neutralization is independent of the epitope recognized. Indeed, an excellent correlation (r = 0.882; P < 0.0001) between neutralization (ID 50 ) and binding to oligomeric gp120 (K 50 ) was observed. Furthermore, the K 50 /ID 50 ratios fell, in general, within a relatively narrow range for antibodies to different neutralization epitopes, suggesting that occupancy of binding sites on HIV-1 virions is the major factor in determining neutralization, irrespective of epitope recognized (Parren et al., 1998) .

For attachment of the virus to the target cell to occur and infection to initiate, it is presumed that multiple contacts in a localized area between gp120 and the primary HIV-1 receptor CD4 must be established. Coating of the virus above a critical density would interrupt this process and FIG. 1. Neutralization of HIV-1 is determined by antibody occupancy irrespective of epitope recognized. The antibody concentration yielding half-maximal binding (K 50 ) and neutralization titer (ID 50 ) and K 50 /ID 50 ratios were determined for a number of neutralizing mAbs against the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), CD4-induced epitope (CD4i), V2 loop, V3 loop, and 2G12 epitopes on gp120 in binding and neutralization assays with HIV-1 LAI and HIV-1 MN (Parren et al., 1998) . Similar K 50 /ID 50 ratios for different epitopes suggests that neutralization is independent of the epitope recognized. This suggests that occupancy of binding sites rather than epitope recognized is the major determining factor in neutralization. (Parren et al., 1998 and reviewed in Parren et al., 1999) . Sch\u00f8nning et al. (1999) analyzed the stoichiometry of HIV-1 neutralization in an elegant study by use of virions carrying mixed envelope spikes on their surface. Cells were transfected with an HIV-1 clone (A308), which is potently neutralized by a mAb against the V3 loop on gp120, and a mutant of this clone, T321, which resists neutralization by this antibody by a loss-of-binding mutation. The proportion of antigen binding sites on the virion could now be titrated by transfecting plasmids encoding the two clones in different ratios. Neutralization of the mixed envelope virions was performed with a high concentration of neutralizing antibody (500 \u00d7 the ID 50 of the neutralization-sensitive clone), so that all available binding sites would be occupied. Neutralization by virion aggregation did not appear to play a significant role in inactivation. The experiment showed that, as the number of binding sites (and therefore the number of bound antibody molecules) increased, viruses become susceptible to neutralization. Neutralization of 63% of the virions occurs at a level of about 35% occupancy, a level which is consistent with stoichiometric arguments presented below (see Fig. 3 ). The increase in neutralization is incremental, indicating a multi-hit rather than a single-hit model (Sch\u00f8nning et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "It has been shown that average, freshly budded HIV-1 virions carry approximately 72 envelope spikes (216 gp120 molecules) on their surface (Gelderblom, 1991) . From the analyses above it can be predicted that the attachment of approximately 70 IgG molecules is required for the neutralization of such HIV-1 virions, which would be equivalent to about one IgG molecule/spike. Klasse and Moore (1996) developed a quantitative model of HIV-1 neutralization to explain the large difference in neutralization sensitivity between TCLA strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 (see , for reviews of HIV-1 neutralization). The model predicts that neutralization of HIV-1 is due to the reduction of the number of active envelope spikes below a minimum required for the induction of a productive infection. Factors contributing to differences in neutralization sensitivity of different virus/antibody combinations are binding constants of neutralizing antibodies to the envelope spike, the number of spikes on the surface, and the minimum number of spikes required for attachment and fusion (Klasse and Moore, 1996) . Possible differences in spike density between neutralization-sensitive TCLA strains of HIV-1 (low active spike densities) and neutralization-resistant primary isolates (high active spike densities) are quoted as an important factor in neutralization resistance (Klasse and Moore, 1996) . Differences in spike densities between TCLA strains and primary isolates, however, are controversial (Karlsson et al., 1996; Sullivan et al., 1995) . Alternatively, the resistance may be due to the poor accessibility of epitopes on the primary isolate envelope spike . Methods that determine the amount of antibody bound using purified radiolabeled virion-antibody complexes (e.g., Taylor et al., 1987) , or quantitative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (e.g., Flamand et al., 1993) , for example, may give reliable data. Methods in which the stoichiometry is extrapolated from kinetic analysis may be inaccurate because of uncertainties with respect to the mathematical models used, particularly in early studies. Rappaport (1970) determined that an average of four antibody molecules bound per neutralized MS2 bacteriophage represented a neutralizing dose. Studies by Collono and Smith and their colleagues have indicated that HRV is neutralized by inhibition of attachment, and that the binding of 6-7 antibody molecules per HRV virion is required to reduce HRV attachment by 63% (Colonno et al., 1989; Smith et al., 1993) . Icenogle et al. (1983) determined that neutralization of poliovirus requires the attachment of 4-5 antibody molecules, as discussed above. The picornaviruses poliovirus and HRV therefore require the attachment of an average of 5-6 antibody molecules for neutralization. A study which assessed the number of IgG molecules necessary to neutralize influenza virus showed for two different mAbs (HC2 and HC10) that approximately 70 molecules were required (Taylor et al., 1987) .",

An average of about 38 bound IgG molecules is therefore required to neutralize a BPV virion. Complexes of mAb 5B6 and 9 with the major capsid BPV protein L1 have been analyzed by cryo-EM. It was shown that mAb 5B6, which apparently requires a slightly lower occupancy for neutralization, binds only to hexavalent capsomers, whereas mAb 9 also binds to pentameric capsomers (Booy et al., 1998) . MAb 9 binds monovalently at the tip of the capsomers and is highly contorted, projecting the Fc domain at a 120 \u2022 angle into the space between the capsomers, while the free Fab domain projects outward. MAb 9 provides a dense extended antibody coat, which is consistent with its ability to inhibit attachment of BPV to the target cell. mAb 5B6 binds deeply between the hexavalent capsomers and adopts a more Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06.xml LaTeX2e(2000/11/02) Textures 2.0 ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF ANTIBODIES 215 linear conformation.

Virions covered with antibodies at low occupancy may infect their target cells more slowly, as discussed above. Such particles, however, are still infectious and therefore do not represent a neutralization intermediate, in our view. Once antibody coating proceeds beyond a critical density, which appears to equal a relatively constant number of antibody molecules per unit of virion surface area, the virion is rendered noninfectious. Neutralization is expected to be reversible by dissociation of the antibody-virion complexes in most cases. Neutralization of a virus population can thus be understood in similar terms. The partial neutralization of a homogeneous virus stock at a certain concentration of antibody (e.g., 50%) simply represents a Poisson distribution of antibody molecules attached to virions at a given point in time. The fraction of the viruses coated with antibody molecules below the neutralization threshold is fully infectious, whereas the complementary fraction is fully neutralized. Because antibody typically is in vast molar excess over virus in a neutralization reaction, the average number of binding sites occupied at a given antibody concentration, and thus the fraction of neutralized virus, is predicted to be primarily determined by antibody affinity for the virion. Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. The antibody occupancy at neutralization for the intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis has been determined in a study which is much less quantitative than the studies on viruses discussed above. We include it in our discussion here, as it is the only study of which we are aware to provide an estimate of the number of antibody molecules required to neutralize a nonviral pathogen. The study found that approximately 1000 antibody molecules of the strongly neutralizing mAb UM-4 were required to reduce infectivity of infectious elementary bodies by 50% (Peeling and Brunham, 1991) . (A higher number was given for a weakly neutralizing antibody, but we consider this less reliable, since the study assumed that all the antibody in an equilibrium mixture was bound to bacteria.) Interestingly, the C. trachomatis data can be fit by extrapolation of the line described for viruses in Fig 3a (Fig 3b) .",

Such a mechanism has indeed been described for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) . A neutralization escape mutant was isolated from a patient who was being treated with a neutralizing human antibody against the HCMV surface glycoprotein gH. The escape mutant was unstable when cultured in the absence of anti-gH neutralizing antibody and displayed a resistant phenotype against a number of distinct neutralizing antibodies and a polyclonal serum against gH. Biochemical analysis revealed that the escape mutant displayed a marked decrease in the amount of gH expressed on the surface. Interestingly, this mechanism of resistance would be consistent with the large differences in susceptibility to neutralization of clinical HCMV isolates, and might be a mechanism by which the virus persists in the presence of neutralizing antibody in the serum . If antibody occupancy indeed plays a major role in neutralization as we suggest, then down regulation of surface-specific molecules on certain viruses may be a more common mechanism of neutralization resistance than currently thought. However, as in the case of HCMV, it may be necessary to culture fresh clinical isolates in the presence of neutralizing antibody to observe these effects, since passaging would allow rapid reversion to wild type.",

Some examples from the literature, however, indicate that a loss of steric hindrance may also play a role in this decrease. Icenogle et al. (1983) showed that treatment of neutralized poliovirus particles at low occupancy (an occupancy of the order of 6 antibody molecules per poliovirus particle reducing infectivity of the virus stock to 28%) with papain to remove the IgG Fc tail reactivated the infectivity.

These authors demonstrated a drop in the neutralization rate constant as neutralization progressed, the magnitude of which correlated with the level of sensitization (Ashe and Notkins, 1967) . Kinetic neutralization studies using HSV presensitized with a neutralizing antibody, furthermore, showed that neutralization rate constants were strongly reduced if the subsequent neutralization reaction was performed with the whole antibody, but were only mildly reduced when performed with the Fab fragment (Ashe et al., 1969) . Therefore, under the conditions used, the antibody already bound to the virion reduced the binding rate of whole antibody relative to that of the smaller Fab fragment, presumably by a steric hindrance mechanism.",

Each virus usually contains only a few copies of the M2 protein (Lamb and Krug, 1996; Murphy and Webster, 1996) .

HIV-1 has been shown to incorporate HLA class I and class II molecules, ICAM-1, LFA-1, and CD44 (Arthur et al., 1992 (Arthur et al., , 1995 Capobianchi et al., 1994; Gelderblom et al., 1987; Hoxie et al., 1987; Orentas and Hildreth, 1993; Saarlos et al., 1997) . Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and FIV, furthermore, may also incorporate HLA antigens (Arthur et al., 1992; Lee et al., 1982) . This may have important consequences, as macaques immunized with human cells or HLA-DR, for example, can be protected from challenge with SIV grown in human host cells (Arthur et al., 1995; Stott, 1994) . It has been suggested that cellular adhesion molecules associated with HIV-1 may have a function in increasing adherence to the target cell and thus enhance virus entry; a particularly well-studied example of which is ICAM-1 (Rizzuto and Sodroski, 1997) . Antibodies against such host cell-derived molecules can have neutralizing activity; for example, ICAM-1-expressing HIV-1 virions can be completely neutralized by an antibody against ICAM-1. Interestingly, the neutralizing antibody activity observed is comparable in magnitude to that of \"classic\" neutralization. The neutralizing effect, therefore, is far greater than can be explained by the loss of adhesion provided by virion ICAM-1 in contact with its cognate receptor LFA-1 on the target cell (Rizzuto and Sodroski, 1997) .",

Clearly, viruses can be neutralized by the binding of antibodies to sites on the viral surface which do not directly serve a function in the infectious process (e.g., influenza HA on SIV). Coating of the viral surface with antibodies against such molecules, and subsequent steric interference with the virion-host cell interaction required to initiate infection, is an attractive hypothesis to explain these observations. Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. If the interruption of viral infection is primarily mediated by an occupancy and steric hindrance mechanism as we propose, then binding of antibodies to the viral receptor on the target cell should also inhibit the initiation of infection. We would predict that the ability of antireceptor antibodies to inhibit infection would then also be a function of occupancy and mostly independent of the epitope recognized. One of the best studied examples is probably the inhibition of HIV-1 infection by antibodies against its primary receptor CD4. CD4 is a molecule of four Ig-like domains. The first two domains project from the cell surface and are connected by a hinge to the last two domains that have been suggested to lie parallel to the cellular membrane (Wu et al., 1997) . The gp120binding site has been mapped to the first, most membrane-distal domain of CD4 (Arthos et al., 1989) .",

It is interesting that even antibodies mapped to the third domain, which do not affect the interaction between CD4 and gp120, effectively inhibit infection. A comparison of mAbs against the first and third domains indicated that these antibodies inhibited HIV-1-induced syncytium formation for a range of isolates with similar potency. Inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity required that binding saturation of all available binding sites on the target cell surface was achieved. This inhibition was not correlated with a down regulation of CD4 during the experiment (Healey et al., 1990) . The potency of mAbs to the third domain of CD4 is noteworthy, given that this domain is not required for HIV-1 infection, as shown by replacement of the last two domains of CD4 with those of CD8, with retention of receptor activity (Bedinger et al., 1988) . One antibody, which probably binds to domain 3 (OKT4), did not inhibit HIV-1 infection. However, this may reflect the relatively poor affinity of this antibody for CD4 (Healey et al., 1990; Truneh et al., 1991) . One antibody against the fourth domain of CD4 does not appear to block HIV-1 infection (Healey et al., 1990; Truneh et al., 1991) . Even though antibodies against the third domain of CD4 inhibit HIV-1 infection, they do not appear to inhibit virion binding to CD4 + T cells (Healey et al., 1990; Ugolini et al., 1997) . Interestingly, it has been shown that most anti-CD4 antibodies, irrespective of the epitope recognized, are able to interrupt major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-dependent T cell activation. Similar to their HIV-1 inhibitory activity, significant inhibition only occurs at near-saturating antibody concentrations (Merkenschlager et al., 1990) .",

            "text": "The studies described above appear to show that inhibition of HIV-1 infection by anti-CD4 antibodies is dependent on the saturation of all available binding sites and is mostly independent of epitope recognized. However, a difference Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. exists between antibodies against the virus and CD4 in their ability to inhibit virus-cell binding. Whereas all neutralizing antibodies against gp120 inhibit virus attachment, only antibodies which bind in the direct vicinity of the highaffinity gp120 binding site on CD4, and not antibodies to more-distant epitopes, including those in the first domain, inhibit attachment (Truneh et al., 1991; Ugolini et al., 1997) . It may be that antibody affinity plays a role in the observed difference, as the inhibitory CD4 mAbs tested were of higher affinity than the noninhibitory CD4 mAbs (Healey et al., 1990; Truneh et al., 1991) . Alternatively, it may be a consequence of differences in antibody coating densities. The spike density on the virus, and therefore its antibody coating density, is several orders of magnitude greater than the receptor and resulting antibody coating density of the target cell. It is therefore conceivable that a virus densely coated with a dense antibody cannot approach the target cell sufficiently to initiate binding, whereas viruses are not inhibited in their approach to separated clusters of CD4 molecules with antibodies attached to epitopes distant from the gp120 binding site. Presumably, however, the antibodies attached to CD4 then perturb the necessary spatial organization of the multiple envelope-receptor contacts and conformational changes required to initiate a productive infection event.",

            "text": "Notably, it has been suggested that these same antibodies can interrupt the precise spatial organization of CD4-T cell receptor and accessory molecules required for triggering T cell proliferation (Merkenschlager et al., 1990) . Following CD4 binding, HIV-1 requires the interaction with a chemokine receptor, belonging to the seven-transmembrane G-coupled receptor family, as an obligatory coreceptor for HIV-1 entry into the target cell. While a large number of chemokine receptors can serve as coreceptors for HIV-1 entry, the majority of isolates use either CXCR4 or CCR5 as their major coreceptor (see Berger, 1997 , for a review). A recent study investigated the inhibition of HIV-1 infection by antibodies against a number of epitopes on CCR5 (Lee et al., 2000) . An antibody against the second extracellular loop (ECL2-A epitope), mAb 2D7, effectively inhibited HIV-1 infection and gp120 and chemokine binding to receptor. All other antibodies studied and directed against a different epitope on ECL2 (ECL2-B epitope), the N-terminus and epitopes involving multiple loops, blocked infection more poorly or not at all, and varied in their ability to inhibit gp120 and chemokine binding to receptor. MAbs against the N-terminus blocked gp120 binding better than chemokine binding, while the reverse was found for antibodies against the ECL2-B epitope. The affinities of these antibodies for CCR5 varied but were equal or greater than that of mAb 2D7 in some cases (Lee et al., 2000) . Interestingly, it was found that CCR5 may exist in multiple conformational forms on the cell surface. MAb 2D7, the antibody with the strongest neutralizing activity, recognizes an epitope which is expressed on a much greater proportion of the CCR5 molecules than all the other mAbs tested, which appear to bind to only a fraction of the CCR5 molecules expressed Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. (Lee et al., 2000) . Therefore, a correlation between inhibition of HIV-1 infection and occupancy of binding sites exists, similar to the studies discussed above. We suggest that most antibodies against CCR5 are not effective in inhibition of HIV-1 infection, as they only recognize a subset of CCR5 molecules on the cell surface and therefore cannot saturate potential HIV-1 coreceptor binding molecules.",

            "text": "The binding of antibodies to the viral surface may lead to the activation of complement, which is dependent on the isotype of the antibody and the spacing of the epitope recognized. Complement activation may lead to virus inactivation at subneutralizing concentrations. A number of enveloped viruses including HIV-1, HCMV, and vaccinia virus (Smith, 1999; Spiller et al., 1997) carry complement regulatory molecules on their surfaces. These are acquired from the host cell membrane during budding (e.g., CD46, CD55, and CD59), or recruited from plasma by attachment envelope glycoproteins, as in the case of factor H and HIV-1 (Saifuddin et al., 1994 (Saifuddin et al., , 1995 Stoiber et al., 1997; Sullivan et al., 1996) . These regulatory molecules promote the resistance of virions to virolysis by inhibiting full activation of the complement cascade and thereby provide the virus with a means to escape inactivation by the binding of relatively low amounts of antibody. Primary isolates of HIV-1 have been found to be more resistant than TCLA viruses to complement-mediated virolysis (Saifuddin et al., 1995; Spear et al., 1990; Sullivan et al., 1996) . The resistance of primary isolates to virolysis was found to directly correlate with the poor exposure of antibody binding sites on the primary virus envelope (Takefman et al., 1998) . A difference has been noted between HIV-1 primary isolates (grown in PBMC in vitro) and plasma virus in their sensitivities to complement-mediated neutralization (Sullivan et al., 1996 (Sullivan et al., , 1998a Takefman et al., 1998) . Plasma virus is considerably more sensitive to antibody-dependent, complement-mediated virolysis (Sullivan et al., 1996; Takefman et al., 1998 ). An explanation can be found in low expression levels of complement regulatory factors, in particular CD46 and CD55, on the plasma virion surface, compared to on a primary isolate virion (Sullivan et al., 1996) . Diminished expression of these complement regulatory molecules on plasma virions may be explained by their decreased expression on CD4 + lymphocytes from HIV-1 infected individuals, since the viral membrane is derived from the cell membrane (Lederman et al., 1989; Weiss et al., 1992) .",

This indeed would seem an effective mechanism by which virions with neutralizing antibody bound at low occupancy may escape inactivation in vivo. Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. Polymeric IgA and IgM involved in mucosal immunity may make use of a specialized route to neutralize viruses or prevent viral entry into the host. These antibodies are actively transported over the mucosal epithelium after binding to the polymeric Ig receptor and may, during transport, contact and neutralize transcytosing viruses. Sendai virus added to the apical side of an epithelial cell monolayer was shown to interact intracellularly with polymeric IgA added basolaterally, and viral titers were reduced in cellular supernatant and lysate (Fujioka et al., 1998; Manzanec et al., 1992) . Manzanec et al. demonstrated neutralization of influenza virus via a similar mechanism (Manzanec et al., 1995; reviewed in Kato et al., 2000) . Studies by Bomsel et al. (1998) have shown that that transcytosis of primary HIV-1 isolates over tight epithelium can be blocked by dimeric immune IgA and IgM. It was shown that basolaterally internalized antibodies met transcytosing virions at an intracellular compartment, thereby redirecting the virions back to the mucosal compartment (Bomsel et al., 1998) . Although the affinity for virions of the polyclonal dimeric IgA and IgM, purified from serum from infected individuals, is likely to be low, efficient binding may be occurring by a multivalent interaction at relatively high concentrations within the intracellular compartment. Polymeric IgA and IgM therefore may bind to virus in an intracellular compartment, neutralizing infectivity or redirecting transcytosis.",

It may be that, in many cases, antibodies limit infection, and cellular and innate immunity are also required in protection from disease. Antiviral monoclonal antibodies permit a more quantitative investigation of the relationship between neutralization in vitro and protection in vivo. Clearly, the comparison presents difficulties in that, even if very similar antiviral mechanisms operate in vitro and in vivo, the latter involves a variety of factors for which it is difficult to control, and which may not be easily reproduced in vitro. For instance, the host cell type used in vitro may differ from the activation/maturation state of the cell type infected in vivo. In fact, cell lines are often used in vitro. Other factors and molecules may be influential in vivo but absent in vitro. Viruses with distinct characteristics may be selected in vivo and in vitro, leading to aberrant conclusions; HIV-1 and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) are striking examples, which will be discussed below. Thus, caution in any comparison is appropriate, but nevertheless it is important to ask how well neutralization of mAbs in vitro correlates with protective activity in vivo. It should be pointed out that a good correlation does not necessarily prove that the mechanisms of in vitro neutralization and in vivo protection are the same. Since neutralization is so strongly correlated with virion binding, any mechanism that was strongly correlated with such binding (e.g., complement-mediated virolysis) could in theory be responsible. However, in many cases, in vivo activity has been shown to be independent of the Fc part of the IgG molecule, implying that the neutralization blocking mechanism is probably paramount.",

TCLA viruses, which are much easier to neutralize in vitro, are correspondingly much easier to protect against in vivo. Similar findings with regard to the relationship between neutralization and protection are apparent for challenge of macaques with chimeric SIV/HIV (SHIV) viruses (Baba et al., 2000; Mascola et al., 2000; Shibata et al., 1999) . In one instance of mucosal challenge, partial protection was described for a serum mAb concentration corresponding to only about 90% neutralization in vitro (Mascola et al., 1999) . Recently, however, we have found that protection from mucosal challenge with an R5 SHIV virus required mAb concentrations capable of neutralizing essentially all of the challenge virus (Parren et al., 2001b) . In fact, the results in the macaque model closely paralleled those in the SCID mouse study: Since effector systems are likely to be considerably more efficient in the former than the latter model, the results imply that effector systems are not essential in protection against HIV-1.

Antibodies against Gross virus cell surface antigens provided complete protection against challenge with syngeneic Gross cell surface antigen-positive leukemia cells. Lysis of these cells by CMC was demonstrated in vitro (Old et al., 1967) . The Gross virus cell surface antigen was later found to be identical to MuLV glycogag, which is a glycosylated version of the gag polyprotein that is expressed on the cell surface but is not incorporated into virions (Ledbetter and Nowinski, 1977) . It should be noted that the antisera used by Old et al. (1967) also contained neutralizing antibodies against Gross virus, so that it is uncertain that all of the protective effect was mediated by antibodies against glyco-gag. Similarly, however, nonneutralizing mAbs against Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV), which react with a Friend-Moloney-Rauscher virus group-specific antigen expressed on the surface of infected cells but not on virions, protect against tumor growth (Lamon et al., 1987) . Pincus et al. (1995) more recently showed that nonneutralizing antibodies against MuLV (glyco-)gag delayed onset of MuLV pathogenesis. An antibody against gag also delayed disease onset as a Fab fragment (albeit less effectively), indicating that clearance of infected cells by Fc-mediated effector functions cannot wholly explain the protective effect. It has been shown that MuLV glycogag plays an important role in viral spread and pathogenesis (Corbin et al., 1994; Portis et al., 1994) . Occupancy of glyco-gag on the cell surface by antibody in the form of whole IgG as well as Fab fragment may therefore be able to interfere with glyco-gag function, thereby providing protection by limiting virus spread without directly clearing infected cells.",

The model used is complex but interesting, as Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. it is one of the few models of an immunosuppressive retrovirus inducing disease in immunocompetent mice. Challenge is performed with a combination of two viruses: a nonpathogenic replication-competent helper virus (F-MuLV), which contains all the required immunological determinants, and a replicationdefective virus, spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), required for pathogenicity in adult mice (Dittmer et al., 1998) . Immunization with attenuated F-MuLV elicits highly protective immune responses. It has been shown that this protective immune response involves a CD4 + and CD8 + T cell as well as a B cell component, as protective responses could only be transferred to na\u00efve mice by combining all three cell populations in the transplant (Dittmer et al., 1999a) . Neutralizing antibodies are present in this response at a level below the concentration required to provide sterile immunity, but nevertheless appear to play an important role in the observed protection against disease, as evidenced by the following. First, protection from plasma viremia is completely correlated with the presence of F-MuLV neutralizing serum antibodies (Dittmer et al., 1999a) . Second, passive transfer of a F-MuLV neutralizing antibody to the same level as observed after immunization protects against pathogenicity, as all animals receiving the antibody recovered from Friend virus-induced disease (Dittmer et al., 1999a) . Third, complete protection correlated with the presence of both virus-neutralizing antibodies as well as primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Development of protection against persistent infection, in particular, only developed postimmunization after the appearance of neutralizing antibodies (Dittmer et al., 1999b) . This series of experiments indicates that neutralizing antibodies below the level required to induce sterile protection can play a critical role in protection against a retrovirus.",

Neutralizing mAbs completely protected mice at relatively high doses. Nonneutralizing mAbs also protected, although they were less effective. Neither class of mAbs protected, if given as early as 2 hr postinfection. The nonneutralizing mAbs bound much less effectively than neutralizing mAbs to intact virions. However, the nonneutralizing mAbs could lyse infected cells in the presence of complement. Further, the F(ab ) 2 fragment of a nonneutralizing mAb was not protective, whereas the same fragment of a neutralizing mAb was protective. It was suggested that the nonneutralizing mAbs were likely mediating protection via Fc-dependent effector function activity against infected cells. The behavior of the F(ab ) 2 fragment of the neutralizing mAb suggests that effector systems are not crucial in the protective activity of this antibody. A very interesting feature of this study is the evidence it provides that a certain form of the envelope protein is present at the surface of infected cells, which is essentially absent from virions.

(1997) who described the properties of a large panel of mAbs to a single antigenic site on VSV-G. The authors reported a good correlation between neutralizing ability of antibody and affinity (avidity) for intact virus particles. However, these two parameters were reported not to correlate with the ability of antibody to protect SCID mice from viral challenge. Protection was said to depend simply upon a minimum serum concentration of antibody independent of affinity. However, most of the antibodies studied fell in a rather narrow affinity range (2-9 \u00d7 10 9 M \u22121 ; corresponding to a free energy of binding range of only about 1 kcal/mole), and indeed the minimum serum concentration for complete protection (3/3 mice) occurred over a corresponding narrow range of roughly 20-50 g/ml. An antibody of significantly lower affinity (2.5 \u00d7 10 7 M \u22121 ) was found not to protect mice at any of the concentrations used. This contradicted the thesis that neutralization and protection were not correlated, and was interpreted as a \"threshold effect\" below which the protective behavior of antibody was predictable by the law of mass action. One antibody of somewhat lower affinity (2 \u00d7 10 8 M \u22121 ) but apparently disproportionately poor neutralizing ability was able to protect all challenged mice at approximately 20 g/ml. In our view, this latter antibody is the only one that potentially offers a significant challenge to the correlation between affinity/neutralization and protection.",

The ability of a panel of 13 mAbs given i.p. to protect mice against intracerebral challenge with MHV-4 showed that 3 potently neutralizing mAbs specific for the E2 glycoprotein were protective at high dose (Buchmeier et al., 1984) . MHV-4 infection was not blocked completely, but viral loads in liver, brain, and central nervous system (CNS) were lower than in unprotected mice, and demyelination rather than fatal encephalomyelitis resulted. One potently neutralizing anti-E2 mAb was not protective. However, this mAb recognizes an epitope which is subject to rapid neutralization escape (Dalziel et al., 1986) , and the challenge virus may have contained escape variants of unusual fitness in vivo (M.

Nonneutralizing anti-E1 membrane glycoprotein and anti-N nucleoprotein mAbs were nonprotective. Another study investigated the activities of 20 mAbs specific for the E2 protein of MHV-4 (Wege et al., 1984) . Three mAbs that potently neutralized virus, inhibited cell fusion, and bound well to infected cells protected against intracerebral challenge. All other mAbs including some that neutralized more weakly and some that did not neutralize but bound well to infected cells were not protective. A further study assessed the activities of 4 anti-E1 mAbs. Only one was neutralizing and then only in the presence of complement. This mAb was protective. Of the 3 nonneutralizing mAbs, 1 was protective. The neutralizing mAb was equally effective in C5deficient or decomplemented mice, suggesting that complement was not crucial for protection.",

Protection against lethal challenge was provided by a potent neutralizing anti-E2 mAb, a nonneutralizing anti-E2 mAb, and a nonneutralizing anti-nucleoprotein (NP) mAb. However, the neutralizing mAb resulted in much lower viral loads in the tissues of infected animals, particularly in the brain where viral titers were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower for the neutralizing mAb-treated than the nonneutralizing mAb-treated mice. Furthermore, the neutralizing mAb was able to protect against a challenge dose of 30,000 pfu compared to the usual dose of 30 pfu. Protection by the anti-NP is presumably mediated by activity against infected cells that express NP on the surface, and this was confirmed for MHV-3 challenge (Lecomte et al., 1987) .",

Both treatments led to serum neutralizing antibody titers of 1:16. IgG treatment markedly, and F(ab ) 2 treatment moderately, reduced footpad viral titer, viral spread to sciatic nerve and spinal cord, and the establishment of latency. The IgG effects were also apparent in C5-deficient mice. A further study looked at the activity of immune mouse and human IgG against HSV in nude mice (Hayashida et al., 1982) . Relatively high concentrations of antibody (1 ml of serum neutralizing titer >1 : 32 given i.p.) were required to inhibit the development of skin lesions and to prolong survival of lethally infected mice.

The mAbs were chosen to have a range of neutralizing activities. In the presence of complement (1.6% serum), neutralizing ability was differentially enhanced from 2-to 75-fold. The serum antibody concentration conferring protection was two to three orders of magnitude higher than the concentration required for 50% neutralization in vitro in the presence of complement. However, the rank order of protective ability was not well predicted by the order of neutralizing ability. et al. (1986) have shown in passive transfer studies that a good correlation exists between neutralization and protection against FDMV, as only antibodies which neutralized a certain FDMV challenge isolate strongly or moderately provided protection. Interestingly, however, these antibodies protected at concentrations 10-to 60-fold below those required for in vitro neutralization of FDMV. The enhanced protective ability of these antibodies appeared Fc-mediated, as conversion of the mAb into F(ab ) 2 fragments reduced protective ability, whereas their neutralizing ability was mostly retained (McCullough et al., 1986) . Neutralization titers were not affected by the addition of complement, suggesting that CMC did not play a significant role (McCullough et al., 1988) . The effect rather appeared due to the induction of phagocytosis of sensitized virus, as impairment of phagocytosis by silica treatment abrogated the enhanced protection. In silica-treated mice, neutralizing antibody concentrations Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. well over the 90% neutralization titers were required for protection, indicating that in the absence of phagocytosis, protection correlates with neutralization of all the challenge virus. It is likely that efficient protection against FDMV infection by neutralizing antibody at low occupancy is provided by an efficient phagocytosis of sensitized virions, as has been demonstrated for FDMV in vitro (McCullough et al., 1988 (McCullough et al., , 1992 .",

Passively transferred polyclonal antibody administered i.p. to produce a serum neutralizing titer of 1:380 or greater provided sterile protection in the lungs of cotton rats challenged with RSV (Prince et al., 1985b) . Similarly, high doses of anti-F or anti-G glycoprotein mAbs reduced the virus titers in the lungs of cotton rats challenged with RSV to undetectable levels (Walsh et al., 1984) . From 15 anti-RSV mAbs, including 10 to the F glycoprotein, only 2 were neutralizing in vitro, and these were the only mAbs that were completely protective in mice (Stott et al., 1984) . In contrast, a nonneutralizing anti-G mAb that protects SCID mice against intranasal RSV challenge at a dose of 5 mg/kg has been described (Corbeil et al., 1996) . Protection is reduced in decomplemented or C5-deficient mice, suggesting complement is important in the antiviral activity. In bovine RSV, two neutralizing anti-F mAbs administered by the intratracheal route at moderate dose (0.4 mg/kg) protected against infection, whereas a nonneutralizing mAb was not protective (Thomas et al., 1998 ). An anti-F IgA at 0.5 mg/kg introduced intranasally to mice prior to RSV challenge greatly reduces virus titers in the lungs (Weltzin et al., 1994) . In human phase III trials, the enhanced activity of one mAb relative to another has been attributed at least in part to its better neutralizing ability in vitro (Johnson et al., 1999) .",

The adaptation of HIV-1 to growth in CD4 + T cell lines selects for variants that are readily neutralized by soluble CD4 and a large spectrum of different mAbs. By contrast, plasma virus or viruses which have only been passaged in primary cultures of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are mostly resistant to neutralization by these same ligands (reviewed in Parren et al., 1999) . An explanation for this phenomenon may be the high expression levels of heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of T cell lines, which through an interaction with gp120 may select for HIV-1 viruses with unusual strongly basic gp120 V3 loops (Moulard et al., 2000) . The envelope spike of these TCLA viruses adopts a much more open configuration, which provides access to a range of epitopes which are inaccessible on naturally occurring HIV-1 isolates. Consequently, sera from HIV-1 infected individuals, as well as sera from vaccinees immunized with recombinant HV-1 envelope subunits, typically contain high titers of neutralizing antibodies against TCLA strains of HIV-1, whereas the more relevant titers against HIV-1 primary isolates are usually very poor.",

            "text": "It is in the nature of passive transfer studies that typical virus challenge doses are relatively large to ensure that all control animals become infected. It is sometimes argued that, in some human infections, challenge doses could be smaller and protection achieved at lower antibody concentrations than indicated from animal studies. For example, SIV or SHIV experiments in macaques usually involve virus challenge doses of 10 AID 50 (50% animal infectious dose) or more. However, the typical human challenge dose with HIV-1 is probably 0.01 AID 50 or less, since the frequency of infection is about 1:100 or less, depending upon the nature of exposure. This has been interpreted to indicate that relatively low vaccine-induced serum antibody concentrations compared to in vitro neutralization titers may offer protective benefit against HIV-1 infection. From a thermodynamic standpoint, this argument appears to have little merit, since the amount of serum antibody will be in vast molar excess over the challenge virus in most scenarios, and the extent of antibody coating of virus (and therefore neutralization) should be determined by the binding constant of antibody to virus rather than the number of challenge particles. However, there are no studies of which we are aware that have directly addressed the ability of antibody to protect at very low challenge doses. For a given virus, the existence of factors during low dose natural infection processes outside the laboratory that complicate the extrapolation from animal studies to humans cannot be categorically excluded.",

The presence of high levels of neutralizing antibody should eventually terminate infection. However, for viruses that do propagate via cell-to-cell spread, antibody would be expected to be less effective, since higher concentrations of neutralizing antibody are generally required to inhibit infection by this route than are required to inhibit infection by free virions (Hooks et al., 1976; Pantaleo et al., 1995) . Indeed, for HIV-1, hu-PBL-SCID mouse studies suggest that the virus replicates unhindered in a significant proportion of cases in the presence of serum concentrations of a single mAb that are largely protective if administered prior to virus challenge . In the remainder of cases, neutralization escape occurs rapidly, showing that the mAb does exert some pressure on virus replication in those animals. If a cocktail of mAbs is administered at high dose (50 mg/kg) in established infection, then neutralization escape is rapidly apparent. However, as the serum mAb concentrations wane to around 10 times 90% in vitro neutralization levels, the wild-type neutralizationsensitive virus reemerges. This suggests that the escape variants are less fit than the wild type, and establishes a high threshold of serum antibody to impact upon propagation of infection. Another study shows that passive transfer of neutralizing polyclonal anti-SIV antibody has a very modest effect upon SIV replication in macaques (Binley et al., 2000) .",

High doses of neutralizing mAb could induce recovery, but success was dependent upon the presence of Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06. both CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. The results strikingly demonstrate the ability of antibody and two populations of T cells to work together in a way which is not fully understood at this time. RSV is a virus that, from its name, one might expect to propagate via cellto-cell spread. However, although syncytia are observed in vitro, they have not been observed in vivo, and the mode of infection propagation is unclear. Because the tracheal epithelium is only sparsely infected at any point in time, however, it is unlikely that cell-to-cell spread is a major mechanism of spread in vivo (McIntosh and Chanock, 1990) . In any case, a number of studies have shown that neutralizing antibody can have a therapeutic effect. Early work in the cotton rat model showed that passively administered polyclonal immune antibody resulting in serum neutralizing titers in the range 1:400-1:1000 could drastically reduce the virus titers in the lungs by as much as a factor of 10 4 (Prince et al., 1985a) . Later work focused more on intranasal inoculation when relatively small quantities of neutralizing antibody were found to be effective in cotton rats, mice, and monkeys (Crowe et al., 1994; Hemming et al., 1985; Prince et al., 1987 Prince et al., , 1990 Weltzin et al., 1996) . Therapeutic effect could be achieved with F(ab ) 2 (Prince et al., 1990) and Fab fragments (Crowe et al., 1994) of neutralizing antibody, suggesting that it was a direct result of interaction between antibody and virus. In the case of Fab fragments, viral loads in the lungs of infected mice could be reduced by a factor of almost 10 4 by as little as 13 g of protein introduced intranasally.",

MAbs at high dose given 24 hr postexposure were similarly shown to protect against HSV-1-induced ocular disease in mice, with protection occurring for nonneutralizing as well as neutralizing mAbs, suggesting, as expected, the importance of activity against infected cells. Protection against intracerebral challenge of mice with YF virus was shown to occur even when mAbs were given i.p. several (3-5) days after virus inoculation when peak infectious virus titers and histopathological evidence of infection were present in brains. Nearly complete protection (eight of nine animals) was noted for one mAb given at a dose of approximately 1.5 mg/kg 4 days after cerebral challenge. Protection was apparent for neutralizing and nonneutralizing mAbs. Furthermore, some of the nonneutralizing mAbs were shown to inhibit viral replication in vitro in a neuroblastoma cell line, hinting at a novel mechanism of antibody protection.

For instance, a potent neutralizing mAb given at approximately 8 mg/kg 1 week postchallenge led to the survival of roughly half of the animals infected. Protection was apparent with both neutralizing and nonneutralizing polyclonal antibodies, but a nonneutralizing mAb was far less effective than the neutralizing mAb. Serum complement was not required for antiviral activity. Attempts to investigate the activity of F(ab ) 2 fragments in comparable experiments were thwarted because of the short half-life of F(ab ) 2 , so that even daily administrations did not maintain serum levels. This careful work emphasizes that, unless F(ab ) 2 levels are specifically monitored, conclusions drawn from comparing IgG and F(ab ) 2 should be treated with caution. Further studies show that high doses of neutralizing mAbs can protect mice against lethal challenge with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (Fujinami et al., 1989 ) and neurotropic measles virus (Liebert et al., 1990) when given 2 days and 5-8 hr postexposure, respectively. In the latter case, nonneutralizing mAbs are ineffective. Further, the latter study again provides evidence of the ability of antibody to restrict viral replication inside an infected cell by binding to viral antigen. This is an interesting and potentially very important phenomenon. It was first described by Oldstone (1979, 1980) for measles virus-infected cells, and has been extensively investigated by Griffin and co-workers for Sindbis virus infection of neurons (Levine et al., 1991) . Treatment of persistently infected SCID mice with mAbs to the E2 glycoprotein of Sindbis virus results in the gradual noncytopathic removal of viral RNA by a process which is independent of complement and T cells. Antibodies can also clear Sindbis virus from persistently infected neuronal cell cultures. The isotype of antibody is not important, but bivalency is required (Ubol et al., 1995) . It is suggested that clearance involves a novel mechanism triggered when antibody cross-links viral protein expressed on the surface of infected cells. A similar mechanism has been proposed for antibody activity against rabies-infected neural cells (Dietzschold et al., 1992) . This mechanism is distinct from earlier studies that described the ability of antibody to modulate antigen expression at the surface of infected cells and thereby reduce the efficiency of virus budding (e.g., Chesebro et al., 1979) .",

A prominent opinion has been that antibodies can act at many different stages of the infectious process, including post-viral entry to the target cell, that several different mechanisms may operate in concert, and that critical sites on the virion surface must be occupied for neutralization (Dimmock, 1993) . We disagree. We believe that the data are consistent, in the vast majority of cases, with a simple occupancy model essentially as initially proposed by Macfarlane Burnet in 1937 . According to this model, neutralization occurs when a sizable fraction of available sites on the virion are occupied by antibody, leading to inhibition of virus attachment or interference with the entry (fusion) process. The relatively large bulk of the antibody molecule, very roughly similar to that of a typical envelope spike for an enveloped virus, is suggested to be critical (Fig. 6) .",

            "text": "The model is consistent with a number of observations. First, we have shown here that there is a roughly linear relationship between the surface area of a virus and the number of antibody molecules bound at neutralization. This number is approximately that predicted to effectively coat the virion particle, given the Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06.xml LaTeX2e(2000/11/02) Textures 2.0 FIG. 6. Model for proposed interactions between envelope spikes and neutralizing IgG. The molecules depicted are drawn to scale assuming that an IgG molecule has roughly the same molecular weight as the monomer of a typical trimeric envelope spike. The model explains how antibody coating of the virus surface may interrupt infection without occupying all available binding sites. (a) Envelope spike with an IgG molecule bound. Additional binding sites on the envelope spike are still available and the binding of additional antibodies to distinct epitopes or recombinant soluble receptor molecules may not be inhibited. An antibody to the V3 loop on HIV-1 gp120, for example, will not inhibit binding of soluble CD4. (b) Envelope spike with various numbers of IgG molecules associated. Coating of virion spikes with antibody, irrespective of the epitope(s) recognized, interferes with the initiation of a productive infection, as the establishment of multiple critical contacts with membrane receptors required for infection is inhibited by steric hindrance and geometric constraints (see also Parren et al. (1998) size of the antibody molecule. Second, any antibody that binds well to and coats the virion surface should neutralize the virus, as is almost universally found. Nonneutralizing antibodies should not coat the virus, although they may bind at lower levels of occupancy. Heterogeneous envelope spikes provide an opportunity for binding to virions without neutralization because of low occupancy, as discussed above for rabies virus and the FPV/VSV mixed virions. Third, the model predicts that the precise epitope recognized by the antibody on the virion surface should not be crucial. Rather, the number of antibody molecules bound per unit area, which will be determined by the affinity of antibody for virionexpressed antigen, will be most important. This is precisely that which is found for HIV-1, as discussed above. Antibody enhancement of viral infection in vitro receives much attention, although its significance in vivo has only been demonstrated for dengue virus infection. It appears to occur in the presence of subneutralizing concentrations of neutralizing antibodies. The model described above suggests that this is a phenomenon arising from low occupancy of virion sites, as discussed earlier.",

In particular, the concern is expressed that nonneutralizing antibodies might compete with the binding of neutralizing antibodies to virus, thereby interfering with neutralization. First, we strongly question the evidence for binding but nonneutralizing antibodies. Generally, there is a very strong correlation between occupancy and neutralization, and most examples of such nonneutralizing antibodies can indeed be explained by poor virus binding, or even a failure to appreciate that antibodies which bind well to isolated envelope or capsid molecules do not necessarily bind well to the virus particle. Some convincing but isolated examples exist, such as the rabies mutant virus, which merit further investigation. Second, to our knowledge, there is no convincing and confirmed evidence for a nonneutralizing antibody interfering with neutralization.

Protection by antibody at the level of sterile immunity requires activity against free virions, i.e., neutralizing antibodies. Several studies with mAbs show that sterile immunity is only achieved when serum concentrations of the challenged animal are of the order of two to three orders of magnitude higher than in vitro neutralization titers, that is, serum concentrations capable of neutralizing essentially all of the challenge virus. Expressed in another way, serum neutralizing titers of 1:100-1:1000 are required for sterile protection. In a number of cases (discussed above), even such high levels of neutralizing antibody do not provide sterile protection, although they do prevent disease. Most vaccines do not elicit very high neutralizing titers, especially over an extended period, but then they probably do not provide sterile protection. Rather, it seems Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06.xml LaTeX2e(2000/11/02) Textures 2.0 ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF ANTIBODIES 247 likely that they reduce the effective challenge to such a level that infected cells can be controlled by cellular immunity and possibly by antibodies.",

In these cases, it seems likely that the mechanism of protection in vivo is essentially equivalent to neutralization in vitro. In a number of other cases, it appears that F(ab ) 2 fragments, that are equally active as whole IgG molecules at neutralization in vitro, are ineffective at protection. Further, neutralizing mouse IgG1 switch variants are ineffective at protection, whereas IgG2a molecules are effective. In many of these examples, protection is independent of complement, suggesting that protection by neutralizing antibodies requires activity against infected cells as well as free virions. This requirement, in some cases, for activity against infected cells as well as virions may contribute to observations of incomplete correlation between neutralization and protection for neutralizing antibodies, although other factors such as the use of different cell types in vitro and in vivo should be considered. It is worth emphasizing, though, that most neutralizing antibodies protect at appropriate concentrations, and antibodies assessed as the most potent in neutralization assays in vitro generally are the most effective at protection in vivo.",

This activity appears to be directed at infected cells, and generally appears to be somewhat less potent than that of neutralizing antibodies. For instance, cases are described above where neutralizing antibodies are protective against higher challenge doses or more pathogenic viruses than nonneutralizing antibodies. In many cases, protection by nonneutralizing antibodies is shown to depend critically on the Fc part of the antibody molecule and to occur in complement-deficient mice, suggesting that ADCC (or phagocytosis) may be crucial in clearing antibody-complexed infected cells.

Serum neutralizing antibody titers of the order of, or greater than, 1:100 provide the greatest likelihood that antibody alone can protect against viral challenge. In many cases, antibody and cellular responses may cooperate to protect, although, with notable exceptions (Dittmer et al., 1999a) , this is an underexplored area.",

At a given antibody concentration, this is in turn determined by the affinity of antibody for the antigen on the virion surface. Hence, the model predicts that a vaccine should simply aim to elicit antibodies of the highest affinity for the virion surface antigen. This is most directly achieved by immunization with molecules identical to or as similar to the viral surface Immunology PS020-06.tex PS020-06.xml LaTeX2e(2000/11/02) Textures 2.0 248 PARREN AND BURTON antigen as possible. This may not be easy. We have argued that a number of enveloped viruses have evolved surface proteins of low immunogenicity . Subunit envelope proteins appear, in a number of instances, to elicit antibody responses that show little reactivity with the form of the envelope (usually oligomeric) expressed on the virion surface (Parren et al., 1998; Roben et al., 1994; Sakurai et al., 1999; Sattentau and Moore, 1995) . Another interesting question is the value of eliciting antibodies targeted to infected cells rather than virions. There are examples, such as arenaviruses, where complete passive protection appears to require antibodies to infected cells as well as virions. Of course, neutralizing antibodies could fulfill both roles by binding, for instance, to envelope molecules on virions and infected cells. However, it is also possible that epitopes expressed on virions are not expressed optimally on infected cells, for ADCC for example, and then the induction of nonneutralizing antibodies may be beneficial. This is a factor worthy of consideration in vaccine design, particularly using subunit proteins to elicit antibodies.",

Antibodies are already used in certain situations in a postexposure mode to prevent, e.g., disease due to Junin virus (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), rabies virus, and TBEV.
