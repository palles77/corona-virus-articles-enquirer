Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [8Hlglucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins.",

Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensintreated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.",

            "text": "The most distinctive features of glycoproteins are the carbohydrate-peptide linkages which have been classified into two main types: N-glycosidic and O-glycosidic linkages (Sharon and Lis, 1981) . The synthesis and processing of N-linked oligosaccharides are co-as well as posttranslational events. First, a mannoserich precursor oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc from a dolichol donor to an asparagine residue in the nascent growing polypeptide (Waechter and Lennarz, 1976; Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) . Later during the glycosylation process, the oligosaccharide is modified by sequential removal and addition of carbohydrates (Berger et aL, 1982) . In contrast to N-linked glycosylation, synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides occurs by sequential addition of carbohydrates to the polypeptides, initiated by the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to a serine or threonine residue (Berger et aZ., 1982) . The latter steps involved in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides and all or the greater part of O-linked glycosylation are thought to occur in the Golgi apparatus (Berger et al, 1982) . N-Linked oligosaccharides have been observed on most viral glycoproteins previously investigated (Ghosh, 1980) , but recently, evidence has also been accumulating for the presence of O-linked oligosaccharides (Holmes et aL, 1981; Oloffson et CL& 1981; Rottier et aL, 1981; Shida and Dales, 1981; Johnson and Spear, 1982, 1983) . Bovine herpesvirus type-l (BHV-1) specifies more than 25 structural polypeptides of which 11 are supposedly glycosylated (Misra et aL, 1981) . Although there is considerable information available about immune destruction of BHV-1 infected cells (Babiuk et aL, 1975; Rouse et al., 1976; Grewal et d, 1977 Grewal et d, , 1980 Rouse and Babiuk, 1978) , thus far very little was known about the glycoproteins that mediate immune lysis. In order to characterize the major BHV-1 glycoproteins with respect to their biochemical and immunological properties, we recently produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies against BHV-1 (van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et aZ., 1984) . The availability of these monoclonal antibodies allowed us to identify four unique glycoproteins and their respective precursors: GVP 6/11a/16, a complex of three glycopeptides with apparent molecular weights of 130K, 74K, and 55K for which two precursors of 120K and approximately 105K were found; GVP 7 (105K) with one precursor (lOOK); GVP 9 (91K) which has two precursors of 72K and 64K and also occurs as a dimer, GVP 3 (180K); and GVP llb (71K) with one precursor (63K) (van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et aL, 1984, van Drunen Littelvan den Hurk and Babiuk, manuscript in preparation) . These four unique glycoproteins were all expressed on the surface of the virus-infected cells and all, except GVP 7, participated in antibody and complement-mediated (AbC') cytolysis (Misra et al, 1982; van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et aL, 1984) . In order to further characterize these four major BHV-1 glycoproteins, we used two compounds that interfere at different stages during glycosylation. Tunicamycin, by acting as an analog of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, interferes with the formation of the N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphoryldolichol intermediate and thereby completely inhibits the synthesis of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains (Schwartz and Datema, 1980) . Consequently, all glycoprotein-containing enveloped viruses are affected by tunicamycin in such a way that it prevents maturation and production of infectious virus (Schwartz et ai, 1976 , Morrison et al., 1978 Nakamura and Compans, 1978; Stohrer and Huner, 1979; Pizer et aL, 1980) . Monensin is a carboxylic ionophore that is able to equilibrate Na+/K+ levels with a selectivity for Na+ (Pressman, 1976) . Although it interferes with a variety of cellular functions (Tartakoff and Vasalli, 1977; Uchida et aZ., 1980; Basu et al, 1981; Wilcox et al, 1982) , one of its primary sites of action is the Golgi apparatus where it abolishes proton gradients that are crucial for Golgi functions (Pressman, 1976) . Enveloped viruses are all affected by monensin in a similar manner, i.e., post-translational glycosylation (Chatterjee et al., 1982; Johnson and Spear, 1982) and proteolytic processing (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980; Chatterjee et al, 1982) , as well as protein secretion (Strous and Lodish, 1980; Payne and Kristensson, 1982) and transport of viral envelope proteins to the plasma membrane (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980; Strous and Lodish, 1980; Alonso and Compans, 1981; Johnson and Spear, 1982; Payne and Kristensson, 1982) may be inhibited.",

Glycosylation to some extent appeared to be required for proteolytic processing, transport, and expression of the viral glycoproteins on the cell surface. However, the glycosylation process did not have to be completed for these processes to occur. Similarly, partial but not complete processing of viral envelope glycoproteins seemed to be essential for nucleocapsid envelopment or virion infectivity. Finally, the use of these two compounds allowed us to conclude that GVP 6/11a/16 and probably GVP '7 contain only N-linked carbohydrates, whereas GVP 3/9 and GVP llb have N-and Olinked oligosaccharides.",

In order to obtain further information regarding the assembly and release of the virions, BHV-1 was labeled with L-[?S]methionine and analyzed on 20 to 50% potassium tartrate gradients. Gradients of extracellular and cell-associated virus from untreated GBK cells showed two peaks of radioactivity. The denser peak represents complete particles and corresponds to the peak of infectivity, whereas the lighter peak consists principally of incomplete particles that lack DNA (Misra et al, 1981) (Fig. 1A) .",

            "text": "Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. To further confirm that tunicamycin prevented surface expression of viral glycoproteins and to see whether the glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface in the presence of monensin could be recognized and participate in immune-mediated destruction of BHV-1 infected cells, we included these cells as targets in an ADCC assay. The presence of increasing concentrations of tunicamycin in the cells during the infection caused a reduction of specific 51Cr release of 27 to 98%, which corresponded to the decrease and finally lack of expression of any of the glycoproteins on the surface of the infected cells (Fig.  9 ). In contrast, no reduction of specific 51Cr release was observed after treatment of BHV-1 infected cells with increasing concentrations of monensin (Fig. 9) . These results support the previous results which showed that tunicamycin inhibited cell surface expression of BHV-1 antigens whereas monensin did not. DISCUSSION GBK cells failed to produce infectious virus particles when treated with tunicamycin. No extracellular and only small amounts of cell-associated, noninfectious virus were detected. The virus produced under these circumstances was considered defective, since it was not infectious and it had a lower density in potassium tartrate gradients than infectious virus. At increasing concentrations of tunicamycin, viral as well as cellular glycoprotein synthesis was specifically and increasingly inhibited. This is consistent with the known inhibitory effect of tunicamycin on N-linked glycosylation in eukaryotic cells (Schwartz and Datema, 1980) . The effect of tunicamycin on the glycosylation of BHV-1 proteins suggested that, like all other enveloped viruses (Ghosh, 1980) BHV-1 uses cellular enzymes for glycosylation and that BHV-1 proteins produced in the presence of tunicamycin essentially lack N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. This may explain the lower density of the noninfectious virus particles produced by tunicamycin-treated cells. The influence of tunicamycin on infectivity indicated that glycosylation of the viral proteins is required for the production of infectious virus, a phenomenon previously reported for several other enveloped viruses (Schwartz et aL, 19'76, Morrison et aL, 19'78; Nakamura and Compans, 19'78; Stohrer and Hunter, 1979; Pizer et al, 1980) . When GBK cells were treated with monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced. However, the reduction in virus production per se was nbt as dramatic as was virus release. In no instance was virus release completely inhibited. This may be due to the fact that at high cocnentrations, monensin was slightly cytopathic, therefore, some cells may have been easily disrupted, consequently releasing cell-associated virus. In the presence of monensin, viral and cellular glycoprotein synthesis was slightly reduced. This is consistent with the supposed inhibitory effect of monensin on the Golgi complex (Pressman, 1976) where all or the greater part of processing of Nlinked oligosaccharides and synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides is thought to occur (Berger et aZ., 1982) . This suggested that BHV-1 proteins synthesized in the presence of monensin lack fully processed N-linked and/or O-linked carbohydrates and many explain the somewhat lower density of the cell-associated virus particles, produced by monensin-treated cells. It also indicated that complete processing FIG. 9 . Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. GBK cells were infected with BHV-1 at an m.o.i. of 1. Various concentrations of tunicamycin or monensin were added to the cells immediately after virus adsorption and maintained until the cells were harvested at 24 hr postinfection.",

Monensin has been shown to block the processing of Sindbis virus (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980) and HSV-1 (Johnson and Spear, 1982; Wenske et aZ., 1982) glycoproteins at the high-mannose stage. However, the glycoproteins observed in monensintreated, BHV-1 infected cells did not correspond to the normal precursors of these four BHV-1 glycoproteins, suggesting that partial processing beyond the high-mannose stage occurred. In order to determine whether this difference was due to the virus or the cell system used, BHV-1 as well as HSV-1 were grown in the presence of monensin in three different cell lines. These experiments (data not shown) demonstrated that the effect of monensin on BHV-1 or HSV-1 glycoproteins was independent of the cell line used. In addition, whereas the BHV-1 glycoproteins were processed beyond the high-mannose stage in the presence of monensin, the HSV-1 glycoproteins were blocked at the highmannose stage, which is in agreement with previously mentioned observations (Johnson and Spear, 1982; Wenske et ah, 1982) . Thus, the difference in the effect of monensin on BHV-1 and HSV-1 glycoprotein appears to be a reflection of the virus rather than of the cell line. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all BHV glycoproteins to the cell surface. This is consistent with previous reports on a number of other enveloped viruses (Nakamura and Compans, 1978; Norrild and Pederson, 1982; Payne and Kristensson, 1982; Peak et al, 1982) and clearly suggests that glycosylation is required for this process. In contrast to data reported for HSV-1 (Johnson and Spear, 1982) , BHV-1 glycoproteins were transported to and expressed on the cell surface in the presence of monensin. The reasons for this discrepancy are not fully understood, but they could be related to both the virus and the cell systems used. Such discrepancies are not uncommon, since many reports on the effect of monensin on the transport of glycoproteins to the cell surface have been controversial. It is often shown that monensin does prevent transport (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980; Alonso and Compans, 1981; Johnson and Spear, 1982; Payne and Kristensson, 1982) , but sometimes no effect is observed (Alonso and Compans, 1981; Chatterjee et aL, 1982) . One communication described the blockage of transport of both VSV and influenza virus glycoproteins to the surface of baby hamster kidney (BHK-1) cells, whereas influenza hemagglutinin, but not VSV G protein was expressed on the surface of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Alonso and Compans, 1981) . These results indicate that both the virus and the cell may influence the final result. The observation that in the presence of monensin BHV-1 glycoproteins were expressed on the cell surface, whereas HSV-1 glycoproteins are not (Johnson and Spear, 1982) , may be due to the above mentioned difference in degree of glycosylation, which appears to be a reflection of the virus. Furthermore, BHV-1 glycoproteins may be transported by vesicles, like influenza hemagglutinin, whose for-mation is not dependent upon the Golgi complex and thus insensitive to monensin.",

Similar results were reported for HSV-1 infected cells treated with tunicamycin (Norrild and Pederson, 1982) . In contrast, monensin did not affect the efficiency of lysis in the ADCC assay, even though the glycoproteins, synthesized in the presence of this compound were incompletely glycosylated. Thus, the antibodies recognized the BHV-1 glycoproteins, produced in the presence of monensin, and killed the virus-infected cells by ADCC, suggesting that alterations in glycosylation induced by this compound did not affect the antigenicity of the glycoproteins. Consequently, although glycosylation may be required for the proper folding and conformation of the glycoproteins, the complete carbohydrate portion may not be needed and may not play a major role in antigenicity and immunogenicity of BHV-1 glycoproteins.",
