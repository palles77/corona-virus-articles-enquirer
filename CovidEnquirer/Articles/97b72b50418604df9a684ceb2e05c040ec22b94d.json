This is also an important diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the evaluation and treatment of a horse with signs of colic. Nasogastric intubation, followed by creation of a siphon, is performed to evacuate any accumulated fluid or gas in the stomach due to functional or mechanical proximal obstruction of the gastronintestinal tract. Fluid is removed to alleviate gastric pain caused by visceral distention, and most importantly to prevent gastric rupture. Nasogastric intubation is indicated in suspected cases of esophageal obstruction to confirm the diagnosis and relieve the esophageal obstruction. Nasogastric tubes are commercially available that are specifically designed for treatment of esophageal obstruction (directions included with tube). 1 Every clinician develops his or her own technique for passing a nasogastric tube.

Alternatively, total volume obtained minus the amount used to create the siphon can be calculated if two buckets are used. \u2022 Important: Do not administer enteral fluids to patients with significant reflux. It is not absorbed and increases the likelihood of gastric rupture. Excessive reflux is often the result of proximal intestinal obstruction, either mechanical or functional. Patients with a large quantity of reflux should have a nasogastric tube left in place and secured to the halter in an attempt to prevent gastric rupture. The tube should have a Heimlich valve placed over the end to allow fluid and gas to escape. Retrieval of reflux should be repeated every few hours in these cases.",

Note: The technique appears to have merit in horses with severe abdominal distention, providing relief from severe pain. This permits a more complete examination to be performed, and in some cases, resolution of the distention allows intestinal motility to resume and/or the colon to fall in a more normal position (if displaced) . It can be curative in some horses if there is not a strangulating lesion. Buscopan can be given before the procedure if there are strong rectal contractions on the initial abdominal palpation per rectum. The procedure appears to be safe and quick but requires mechanical suction to remove the gas. Dr. Magri has developed a special cylinder that encloses the needle so that there is no danger of the needle puncturing the rectum until it is placed against the distended colon; the device is then activated as it enters the colon. The other end of the instrument is connected to suction. \u2022 Noting the eruption of the deciduous incisors \u2022 Shedding of the juvenile incisors \u2022 Eruption and wear of the permanent incisors Once the deciduous incisors are shed and the permanent incisors are erupted, aging is less clear with advancing age.

In the anatomic system (see Fig. 18 -3), a letter defines the type of tooth being described. All lowercase letters used denote deciduous teeth, capital letters permanent teeth: I, incisors; C, canines; P, premolars; and M, molars. A number then is assigned to the letter that denotes the location of the tooth in the oral cavity (e.g., first molar and second incisor). The oral cavity is divided into four quadrants. The horse's right maxillary arcade is the first arcade. The other three quadrants are assigned sequentially in a clockwise manner from the examiner's position facing the horse. The anatomic letter then has the positional number placed around the letter to represent the location of the tooth. For example, a right mandibular second incisor would be defined as 2 I; a left maxillary second incisor would be defined as I 2 .",

In foals, the most common cause is gastric and esophageal ulceration (see p. 182). \u2022 The cause of salivation can be determined by oral examination in some cases. Evaluate the entire oral cavity, looking for a laceration, ulcerations, vesicular disease, foreign body (especially in the tongue or caught between the upper dental arcade), tooth root or soft tissue abscess, a fractured tooth (see p. 173), injury to the palate, strangles, or evidence of chemical injury. Kicks to the incisors and head or catching the mouth on bucket handles, for example, are all common causes of mouth injury. Tongue injuries are often self-inflicted in horses with cerebral disorders. Stomach tube injury or irritation may cause ptyalism. Sedation (detomidine with butorphanol) and the careful use of an equine mouth speculum may be needed to allow a safe and complete examination of the mouth. \u2022 Practice Tip: Without proper sedation, the mouth speculum becomes a dangerous weapon to the examiner if the patient \"tosses\" his head. \u2022 Excessive biting on the speculum also can result in a tooth fracture. General anesthesia may be required to perform a complete oral examination in some horses, particularly those with foreign bodies and injury to the caudal pharynx.",

These conservative treatments frequently are enough to relax the esophagus and allow the obstruction to pass on its own within 4 to 6 hours. \u2022 Practice Tip: If the horse has choked previously or there is a belief that the choke is of longer than 6 hours' duration, it is considered a medical emergency. Most veterinarians upon arrival prefer to pass a stomach tube following tranquilization, not only to confirm the diagnosis but also to provide a gentle water lavage at the level of the obstruction while the horse's head is kept down along with very gently \"pushing\" the obstruction. This is recommended on the first visit unless you believe the obstruction is very proximal, just caudal to the larynx. In this situation, if there is no evidence of laryngeal obstruction and it is a first-time choke, administer a tranquilizer, withhold feed and water, and allow 3 to 4 hours for this to resolve before attempting lavage. \u2022 N-butylscopolammonium bromide (Buscopan), 0.3 mg/kg IV or IM (7 mL/450 kg), may also help resolve the obstruction by decreasing esophageal tone. Because of its anticholinergic effect, N-butylscopolammonium bromide given intravenously causes a transient (20 to 30 minutes) increase in heart rate. It is recommended for most cases, but because the most common site for choke, the proximal and mid-cervical area, involves skeletal muscle, the benefit is questionable. \u2022 Oxytocin, 0.11 to 0.22 IU/kg IV q6h, is of questionable value, but it may help resolve the obstruction by decreasing esophageal smooth muscle tone. Smooth muscle constitutes only the distal third of the esophagus. Oxytocin administration may be associated with transient abdominal discomfort, sweating, and muscle tremors. Note: Oxytocin should not be administered to pregnant mares because of the potential abortifacient properties. \u2022 If the above treatment is unsuccessful in relieving choke in 4 to 6 hours, consider lavage. With the patient sedated with xylazine or detomidine, causing the patient to lower their head, pass a stomach tube to the proximal limit of the obstruction; gently introduce a small volume of water through the tube and against the obstructing mass. This process should be repeated several times to break up the obstruction. As long as the head is kept low, large volumes of water can be pumped (stomach pump) into a medium-size stomach tube and against the obstruction. \u2022 Practice Tip: In the beginning and before a large volume of water is pumped, it is important to make sure the fluid is able to easily exit around the tube! Gently pressing the tube against the obstruction while flushing may cause the obstruction to move down the esophagus. Once a food obstruction begins to move, the choke is usually quickly resolved. If the obstruction is caused by a rope or another non-plant foreign body, pushing the object further down the esophagus may be contraindicated in case surgical removal is needed.",

The operator needs to check that the primary tube through which choked material and water exit (egress) is not blocked, preventing overpressurization of the esophagus proximal to the obstruction! The valve between the water extension hosing and the proximal end of the ingress inner tube allows the water flow to be turned off at any time. \u2022 Another aggressive lavage method is a warmed, cuffed endotracheal tube passed intranasally into the esophagus, providing the security of an inflatable cuff and preventing aspiration of water during lavage of the esophagus. Warming the tube before passage facilitates passage by making it more flexible. Fluid can be pumped through the endotracheal tube or through a smalldiameter stomach tube that has been passed inside the larger endotracheal tube. The lavage solution is most commonly warm water. Important: Careful manipulation is important to avoid esophageal injury and secondary stricture or esophageal perforation. \u2022 An alternative procedure is to pass the endotracheal tube into the trachea and inflate the cuff to protect the trachea from aspirated material before flushing the esophagus. \u2022 If the obstruction cannot be cleared or if the patient becomes unmanageable under sedation, general anesthesia, with the head positioned \"down, \" is required for a more aggressive lavage. In the weanling or yearling that is difficult to restrain, this might be the easiest approach. \u2022 Practice Tip: If flushing is planned following short-acting anesthesia, always pass the nasogastric tube before general anesthesia; passing the tube into the esophagus of an anesthetized horse is difficult! \u2022 Intravenously administered fluids are an important supportive treatment in prolonged cases of choke to prevent dehydration and \"drying\" of the esophageal obstruction. \u2022 Prophylactic antimicrobial agents are indicated for many choke cases because of the high risk of aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics (e.g., penicillin G procaine, 22,000 IU/kg IM q12h and gentocin 6.6 mg/kg IV or IM q24h; ceftiofur, 2.2 to 4.4 mg/kg IM q12h; or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 20 to 30 mg/kg PO q12h) are usually administered for 5 to 7 days after relieving the obstruction. If the choke is of more than 6 hours' duration, the caretaker did not immediately remove hay and water, or if crackles are heard on thoracic auscultation, metronidazole (15 to 25 mg/kg PO or 25 to 30 mg/kg per rectum q8h) should be added to one of the above treatment protocols.

Horses with impacted ingesta in the stomach may be in uncontrollable pain, which necessitates immediate exploratory surgery. The diagnosis in these cases is made at surgery. Horses with more chronic impactions may have mild to moderate pain. The diagnosis can be made by ultrasound examination, demonstrating an enlarged stomach and gastroscopic examination, showing large amounts of feed present after not being fed for more than 16 hours.",

(If this material has been collected by needle aspiration, it should be repeated with a teat cannula before the diagnosis of ruptured viscus is made.)\u2022 The presence of blood-tinged fluid indicates:\u2022 Splenic puncture \u2022 Intraabdominal hemorrhage \u2022 Iatrogenic hemorrhage \u2022 Intestinal necrosis Practice Tip: With splenic puncture, the PCV of the fluid is greater than the peripheral PCV, and the fluid contains large numbers of small lymphocytes. Fluid from intraabdominal hemorrhage reveals a PCV less than that of peripheral blood, erythrocytophagia, and few to no platelets. Important: The absence of gross or cytologic abnormalities in the peritoneal fluid does not exclude the presence of compromised intestine.\u2022 Some strangulating lesions, such as intussusception, external hernia, and epiploic foramen incarceration may not demonstrate abnormalities in the peritoneal fluid because of sequestration of the fluid in the omentum, intussuscipiens, or hernial sac. \u2022 If sand impaction is suspected or if considerable cecal or colonic distention is present, abdominocentesis should be performed only to confirm suspected bowel rupture. Practice Tip: If physical examination reveals other findings consistent with a surgical lesion and referral for surgery is considered, abdominocentesis should not be performed in the field because of the risk to the patient and the examiner.Medical Versus Surgical ManagementConsiderations in determining the need for exploratory surgery are as follows (Box 18-2): \u2022 Pain \u2022 Response to analgesic therapyBlood GasesAcidemia may be seen with advanced hypovolemic shock. Evaluation of blood gases is important for appropriate management of severe acid-base abnormalities, especially in patients who need general anesthesia and surgical treatment. Patients with simple colon displacements may have an insignificant base excess, whereas patients with strangulating obstruction usually have an obvious base deficit. Lactate Blood and peritoneal lactate is an important laboratory test in the evaluation and monitoring of the acute abdomen.\u2022 Blood and peritoneal fluid lactate determinations can be performed stall-side. \u2022 Elevated blood lactate concentration suggests a global decrease in perfusion (hypotension/dehydration) and/or local ischemia or strangulation. \u2022 Practice Tip: The initial value of the blood lactate is not as important prognostically as the change in lactate after early treatments; absence of a decline in blood lactate 2 to 4 hours after aggressive treatments, including resuscitation with hypertonic saline and/or polyionic crystalloids, is suggestive of a serious and possibly strangulating condition. \u2022 Practice Tip: More significant elevations in peritoneal fluid",
