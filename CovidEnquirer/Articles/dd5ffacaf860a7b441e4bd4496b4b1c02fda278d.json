            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus which infects chickens (Gallus gallus) of all ages and causes significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. The present study aims to analyze the miRNAs related to pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs. It was found that four miRNAs (miR-1454, miR-3538, miR-146a-5p and miR-215-5p) were related to the infection of virulent nephropathogenic IBV with transcript per million (TPM) > 500 and more than a 2-fold alteration. In vitro study results showed that the alterations of these four miRNAs were consistent with in vivo data. In vitro, we found that high levels of miR-146a-5p could enhance the replication of IBV at the early stage of infection, and its down regulated level could slow down the replication of IBV. Finally, high levels of exogenous miR-146a-5p in HD11 cells led to down regulation of IL-1 receptor associated kinase-2 (IRAK2) and Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 18 (TNFRSF18) genes. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-146a-5p could bind to the 3\u2032-UTRs of IRAK2 and TNFRSF18. This is the first study demonstrating that IBV induced miR-146a-5p is related to virus pathogenesis by down regulating IRAK2 and TNFRSF18, which may serve as a therapeutic strategy for the prevention of IBV infections. * Corresponding author.

It causes avian infectious bronchitis (IB), which is an acute highly contagious disease with severe economic losses in poultry industry worldwide [1] . IBV has a large number of genotypes and in China, 19 strains are isolated during 2011-2012. Infected chickens develop respiratory symptoms, coughing, sneezing, depression, nasal discharge, kidney, gonads, reduced egg production, poor egg quality and death. In recent year, nephropathogenic IBVs have become prevalent genotypes in China [2] , new nephropathogenic isolates induce more severe lesions to kidney and show high mortality in young chickens [3] . Currently only IBV Beaudette strain can replicate in HD11 [4] or Vero [5] cell lines. Several recent works have proved the induction of apoptosis and suppression of immune response are related to the pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs [6, 7] . However, the key factor for these process during infection are still unclear.",

Chicken kidney infected with three nephropathogenic IBV with different virulence revealed the differentially expressed genes and miRNAs [6, 16] . Among them, most of the differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs are related to immune response, cell apoptosis, DNA replication and metabolic pathways [6] . 58 differentially expressed miRNAs are considered responsible for the differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs.
