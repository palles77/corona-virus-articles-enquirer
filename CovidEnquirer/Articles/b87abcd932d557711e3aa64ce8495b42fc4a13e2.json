For viruses fitness was originally defined as ''the capacity of a virus to produce infectious progeny in a given environment'' [16] . This definition is still in wide use today, referred to more specifically as replicative fitness [15 ] , measured in cultured cells, tissue explants, or within individual hosts. This standard definition is founded in, but does not exactly match, the more general Darwinian definition of overall fitness, which is the amount of genetic material passed on to the next generation. Due to host immune clearance of viruses and finite host lifespan, viruses must be transmitted to new hosts to survive. As such, transmission fitness is an important component of overall fitness. Ultimately, replication and transmission contribute to the prevalence of viral genetic material at a population level in the field over time. The capacity of a virus (a serotype, clade, or variant) to become dominant in the field, relative to other serotypes, clades, or variants of the same virus has been defined as epidemiologic fitness [15 ] .",

However, it has long been recognized that assessment of fitness in mixed infections of two viral variants is a more sensitive and valid measure of viral fitness differences [16] . Therefore competitive fitness is often examined in growth competition assays, in which cells or hosts are co-infected with mixtures of two viral variants and the replication of each variant is determined in a competitive environment. Variables in these assays include the use of different input ratios, use of a standard reference strain or head-to-head competitions between test variants, and varied timing for analysis of progeny populations. For example, replicative fitness is sometimes examined at one time point post-infection, but it is often assessed at multiple time points [17, 18, 33, 42, 45, 46, 60] There are a variety of methods used to measure replicative fitness. The traditional method quantifies individual viral variants as plaque forming units (PFU). Recent advances in molecular techniques have led to the use of methodologies that measure viral DNA, RNA, or protein levels, such as quantitative PCR, ELISA, fluorescent probe labeling, and next generation sequencing. These molecular methods estimate viral load, and have the advantage that they typically allow for higher throughput as well as sensitivity, and can be used to distinguish viral genotypes in mixed infections. However, they do not quantify infectious virus as PFU assays do, and the relationships between PFU and molecular quantifications of viral load remain to be defined in many systems.",

            "text": "For vertebrate viruses the recent increase of in vivo virus fitness research is encouraging, but the majority of studies still remain in vitro. This is likely due to the ethical and practical constraints of conducting in vivo research in many vertebrate systems, particularly human viruses. Furthermore in vitro work has numerous advantages, most notably it allows for a higher level of control of variables than in vivo work and is useful for understanding phenomena at a molecular or cellular level [62] . The drawback is that it is unclear how well in vitro results reflect natural phenomena in vivo. The relationship between viral fitness and virulence has been of interest for decades, but surprisingly little has been published recently. Many recent publications assume that viral replicative fitness and virulence are positively correlated and thus use the terms interchangeably. For example, the term 'attenuation' is often used to describe a virus with reduced replicative fitness [46] . In actuality, the relationship between viral fitness and virulence remains poorly characterized in many systems, and both agreement and exception to this assumption have been reported [3 ,5,24,27,40,44,58 ] . Some of the discrepancies in this area may come from the multitude of ways virulence is defined or measured, often beyond the standard definition of morbidity and mortality caused to the host due to infection [3 ,19,25-27,43,50,58 ] . More focus on virulence, and definition of system-specific correlations of virulence with fitness would be a benefit to future work.",

            "text": "Viral fitness continues to be an active area of research [7] . Given the increase in issues such as drug resistance evolution, vaccine escape, virulence evolution, viral emergence, and host jumps, the understanding of viral fitness has become essential. For decades viral fitness has been primarily defined by replication capacity in the host. This definition is now broadening as researchers attempt to understand the population level evolutionary implications of overall viral fitness in natural infections. Making inferences about population level processes requires integration of replicative, competitive, transmission, and epidemiologic fitness measures (Figure 1 ). Perhaps the most critical need for the field of viral fitness is the further development of integrative approaches, with the ultimate goals of making accurate predictive inferences and informing long-term management or control of disease. Many the tools to achieve this goal are now available, and we are collectively faced with the task of putting them together. A mathematical framework for estimating pathogen transmission fitness and inoculum size using data from a competitive mixtures animal model. PLoS Computational Biology 2011, 7:11. The authors introduce a mathematical framework for quantitative estimation of the relative transmissibility of two viral types in co-infection in vivo, and the inoculum size associated with transmission events. The model is tested using data from in vivo influenza virus co-infection studies in ferrets, providing one of the first rigorous investigations of transmission fitness for a virus that is directly transmitted between vertebrate hosts (i.e. non-arbovirus).

These studies often quantify transmission and replicative fitness through the vector as well as in the plant or vertebrate host[3 ,8 ,28,35,56], and differences in transmission fitness have been observed. For viruses that are transmitted directly, between-host transmission fitness is investigated by exposing naive hosts to infected hosts and examining the absolute or relative quantities of viral variants in source and recipient hosts. This has been described in several studies of H1N1 influenza virus using in vivo guinea pig and ferret models[17,32 ,46]. Alternative methods for generating inferences about transmission fitness include quantification of shed virus as an indication of transmission potential[58 ], and ex vivo fitness assays assessing replication or transmission efficiency in tissues specifically associated with transmission [1].Transmission fitness studies in plant systems often have additional levels of complexity such as examining multiple rounds of transmission [25], with accurate quantification of the timing of transmission and exposure dosage. Vertebrate virus studies of transmission are beginning to approach the sophistication of plant virus studies, but this remains a major research area for future development. One of the intriguing findings from many systems is that replicative fitness does not always match transmission fitness in that viral genotypes with the greatest replication success are not always those that have the greatest transmission to new hosts[17,46].",

Abraha A, Nankya IL, Gibson R, Demers K, Tebit 92:1930-1938 . This paper provides an example of the sophistication of plant virus fitness work, using two groups of ten plant viral satellite RNAs that differ in fitness and virulence on a tomato host. On a melon host these satellite RNAs differ in multiple measures of viral fitness including replication in single or mixed infections and aphid transmissibility, but they do not differ in virulence, demonstrating both host-specific fitness traits and a lack of correlation between replicative fitness and virulence.

Epistatic effects were found to be common, complex, and often very strong, providing insights into the barriers and probable pathways of evolution of co-receptor usage.",
