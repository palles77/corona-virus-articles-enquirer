The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine were found to have different levels of antioxidant properties in the test models. Both ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) (0.5-2.5 mg/ml) and lycorine (0.010 mg-0.050 mg/ml) increases the percentage of lipid peroxidation inhibition (26.25 \u00b1 0.23% and 19.25 \u00b1 0.23%) and enhances the free radical scavenging activity (20.92 \u00b1 0.22% and 20.52 \u00b1 0.22%), scavenging of hydrogen peroxide (25.67 \u00b1 0.17% and 23.07 \u00b1 0.3%) superoxide anion scavenging activity (27.69 \u00b1 0.16% and 16.09 \u00b1 0.7%) at concentration of 2.5 and 0.050 mg of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine, respectively. But compared with tocopherol (P < 0.05) less activity was observed by C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine. The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine were normalized to reduce the level of glutathione and also to sustain the status of protein in erythrocytes during the peroxyl radical [2,2-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)] induced oxidative damage in ex vivo model. The present results of the investigations demonstrated that protective nature of the C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine will be considered as a significant natural antioxidant source.",

Lipids of biological membranes, especially, those in the spinal cord and brain containing highly oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids are affected (Braughler and Hall, 1989) . Reactive oxygen mediated modification of DNA, proteins, lipids and small cellular molecules is associated with a number of pathological processes including atherosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, cataractogenesis, muscular dystrophy, pulmonary dysfunction, inflammatory disorders, tissue damage and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (Frlich and Riederer, 1995) . The term of the antioxidant is defined as any substance which delays or inhibits oxidation of the substrate (Halliwell and Gutterridge, 1989) . This may be illustrated by considering one of the many mechanisms by which oxidative stress can cause damage by stimulating the free radical chain reaction of lipid peroxidation.",

Most cases confirm the therapeutic value of the plants. However, where plants have been studied chemically a plant potential pharmaceutical value can be assumed, if it is used widely (Githens, 1949) . The reason why Crinum is used for medicinal purposes in many countries for similar reason is possibly due to their alkaloid constituents (Waller and Nowacki, 1978) . Lycorine is a natural alkaloid extracted from amaryllidaceae and it has various pharmacological and microbiological effects. Researchers had revealed that lycorine can inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells (Jimenez et al., 1976) and acetylcholinesterase activity (Hohmann et al., 2002) . In the presence of calprotectin lycorine was shown to inhibit protein synthesis and cell apoptosis in MM46 cells (Elgorashi et al., 2004) . Lycorine was found to posess potent antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (Li et al., 2005) . Lycorine could effectively arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells (Liu et al., 2004) . The present investigation is an endeavor to validate the scientific use of ethanolic extract of Crinum asiaticum (L) and lycorine against 2-amidinopropane induced oxidative damage in human erythrocytes.",

            "text": "Many studies have focused on the free radical initiated peroxidation of membrane lipid associated with a variety of pathological events. All natural and synthetic antioxidants have been used to trap peroxyl radical and other radicals to protect the membrane lipids against free radical chain reactions (Adom and Liu, 2005) . Similarly, our present result shows the ethanolic extract C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine would prevent the eryth-rocyte damage by AAPH induced lipid peroxidation. The AAPH induced lipid peroxidation of erythrocytes is reflected in the MDA generation that occurs with the addition of ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine. MDA levels for the normal-group erythrocytes were 5.3 \u00b1 0.12, 6.2 \u00b1 0.42 and 6.8 \u00b1 0.47 pmol/g Hb, respectively at 20, 40, and 60 min and it was increased to 24.42 \u00b1 0.6, 43.4 \u00b1 0.45 and 57.8 \u00b1 0.16 pmol/g Hb after incubation with 25 mM AAPH. The addition of AAPH caused time dependent lipid peroxidation of erythrocytes. The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine significantly inhibited the AAPH induced MDA formation. The results were presented in Tables 1 and 2. GSH is the major non-enzymatic antioxidant, regulator of intracellular redox homeostasis and is ubiquitously present in all cell types (Meister and Anderson, 1983 ). In the present study, normal human erythrocytes incubate with 25 mM APPH for 1 h resulted in loss of GSH. However, erythrocytes treated with ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine were reverted to the reduced level of GSH when compared with APPH induced erythrocytes. Several workers have suggested that GSH provides the first line of defense during oxidative insult (Vissers and Winterbourne, 1995) . In the presence of free radicals, mainly H 2 O 2 , GSH acts as an electron donor and is oxidized into GSSG by glutathione peroxidase. The GSSG generated is later converted back to GSH by glutathione reductase in which reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is the hydrogen donor. When cellular GSSG levels increase during oxidative stress, GSSG is exported into extracellular fluid to avoid thiol toxicity. In the AAPH-induced erythrocytes hemolysis shows the rapid depletion of GSH that might be caused by oxidation processes taking place in erythrocyte membranes. The resultant lipid peroxides might also react with GSH and that led to a decrease in GSH, it means increase in GSSG. If GSSG accumulates within the cell, it can form protein glutathione adducts via reversible thiol exchange reactions referred to as S-glutathionylation of protein. Protein S-glutathionylation has been implicated in the buffering of oxidative stress, stabilization of extracellular proteins, protection of proteins against irreversible oxidation of critical cysteine residues, and regulation of enzyme activity. Glutathionylated proteins are more stable than GSSG and less prone to enzymatic reduction by glutathione reductase (Tables 3 and 4) . The membrane proteins of erythrocytes are basically composed of band A, B, C, D, E and other accessory proteins. However, expression of these bands vary from APPH induced and drug treated. It is pointed out that some of the higher and lower molecular weight proteins were over expressed in APPH induced erythrocytes when compared to normal and drug treated. Oxidants produce alterations in erythrocyte membranes as manifested by a decreased cytoskeleton protein content (LMW proteins) and production of HMW proteins (Snyder et al., 1985; Flynn et al., 1983) . Similarly, the present results showed over expression of some proteins above the proteins band A when human erythrocytes incubate with AAPH for 3 h. These results assign that both ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) (2.5 mg/ml) and lycorine (0.050 mg/ml) prevent the AAPH induced changes in the erythrocyte membrane proteins. The results were showed in Fig. 6 .",

The ethanolic extract of this plant may be used as a source of natural antioxidants as their crude extracts and lycorine exhibit significant free radical scavenging activity when compared with tocopherol. The results indicate that the different concentration of ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine exhibited significant antioxidant activities. The maximum percentage of free radicals activity were observed by C. asiaticum when compared with lycorine, however, tocopherol showed higher free radical scavenging activity than the C. asiaticum and lycorine. Therefore, purpose of the present finding confirmed that ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine possibly will have defensive antioxidant and have better application in food and drug products.",
