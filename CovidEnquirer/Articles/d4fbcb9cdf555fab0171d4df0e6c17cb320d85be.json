Hong Kong is used as an example. The study first introduces the spatial characteristics of hotels and attractions development in Hong Kong. A geographical information system is then used to map hotels and investigate the characteristics of the land use, attractions, and transport facilities around hotels. The spatial relationships are then analyzed with a set of logistic regression models. The results reveal that commercial land type and the number of attractions around hotels are significantly related to the distribution of upper-grade hotels in Hong Kong. The determinants vary over time and the spatial structure changes accordingly. The analysis is important theoretically as it enriches the methodologies for analyzing the relationships between hotels and urban structure, and for conceptualizing and identifying tourism functional zones. It is important for practitioners as it provides useful information for selecting sites for hotels.",

Within the field, the spatial structure of tourism in cities has been an important research area (Pearce, 1998) , focusing on the ways in which phenomena are arranged in space, and how this affects urban tourism planning and design applications. One important research direction is to empirically analyze the distribution of tourism-related phenomena, such as selected attractions, supporting facilities (Pearce, 1995) , and accommodations in general, hotels in particular. These studies have identified distinct distribution patterns of particular tourism sectors in certain parts of cities, the most notable being clustering and linear patterns; these patterns can be explained by factors such as accessibility, land rent, planning restrictions, comparative shopping, and proximity to other tourism-related phenomena (Ashworth and Tunbridge, 1990; Pearce, 1987 Pearce, , 1995 . However, previous studies have largely focused on the influence of the surrounding environment on the selected tourism sector, and have not fully addressed the interactions and associations between all of the urban tourism phenomena.",

Nowadays, tourism occupies substantial amounts of space within urban destinations via tourist-historic urban cores, museums of all kinds, urban waterfronts, theme parks, and specialized precincts (Edwards et al., 2008) . However, before the 1980s, studies of urban tourism were fragmented and it was not recognized as a distinct http://dx.doi.org/10. 1016/j.ijhm.2014.11 .005 0278-4319/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. field (Edwards et al., 2008) . An upsurge in interest in urban tourism was sparked by Ashworth's work in 1989 , in which he stated that \". . .the failure to consider tourism as a specifically urban activity imposes a serious constraint that cannot fail to impede the development of tourism as a subject of serious study\" (Ashworth, 1989:33) . In his pioneer work, Ashworth (1989) outlined four extant approaches to analyzing urban tourism: (1) the facility approach, which focuses on the spatial analysis of the location of tourism attractions, facilities, infrastructure, and zones; (2) the ecological approach, which focuses on the structure and morphology of urban areas and features the identification of functional zones or districts such as central business districts (CBD); (3) the user approach, which adopts a marketing perspective focused on tourists; and (4) the policy approach, which is concerned with a range of policy issues including infrastructure provision and destination marketing (Ashworth, 1989) .",

The framework emphasized the identification of subject cells within a matrix defined in terms of scale (site, district, city-wide, regional, national, and international) and themes (demand, supply, development, and impacts). For instance, Rigall-I-Torrent et al. (2011) examined the effects of beach characteristics (such as beach length, width, sand type, or beach services) and distance of a hotel from the beach on sun-and-beach hotel prices at the regional level. A study at the city level by Yang et al. (2012) investigated potential factors contributing to hotel location choice in Beijing by incorporating both hotel and location characteristics. They found that star rating, years since opening, service diversification, ownership, the agglomeration effect, public service infrastructure, road accessibility, subway accessibility, and accessibility to tourism sites are all important determinants. While Ruggero and Rodolfo (2014) found that structural social capital is the strongest positive determinant of hotel performance, compared with weaker and generally not significant relations linking occupancy and control variables, such as category, size, location.",

They can be divided into two basic categories: (a) spatial decision support applications and (b) spatial statistics support applications. The former uses GIS systems that are specifically designed to handle spatial relationships to integrate four types of relevant data: tourist characteristics (e.g., Lau and McKercher, 2006) , actual temporal-spatial behavior (e.g., Shoval et al., 2011) , landscape elements and tourist locations (e.g., Brown, 2006) , and the images added to these locations (e.g., Gaughan et al., 2009) . Then, a decision-support model is added to the GIS to analyze the overall temporal-spatial behavior and to obtain some optimal conclusions (Bahaire and Elliott-White, 1999; Beedasy and Whyatt, 1999; Bertazzon et al., 1997; Boers and Cottrell, 2007; Brown, 2006; Dye and Shaw, 2007; Gaughan et al., 2009; Lau and McKercher, 2006; Perez et al., 2003; Shoval et al., 2011; Van der Knaap, 1999) . The second type of application uses GIS not only to integrate data, but also to analyze the spatial patterns of tourism (Allen et al., 1999; Atasoy, 2010; Farsari and Prastacos, 2004; Porter and Tarrant, 2001) . Allen et al. (1999) developed a parcel-based GIS model for assessing land-use change in the past; they built a spatial multivariate logistic regression model and selected 20 variables to predict the possibilities of land-use change for Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. However, the study focused on land-use change in a coastal tourism destination area without investigating the relationship between tourism phenomena and the changes in land use.",

The understanding of the determinants of hotel location selection is key to ensure coherent spatial planning at tourism destinations (Issahaku and Francis, 2013) . According to previous studies, the main research approach used to explain location choices and spatial patterning of hotels are regression methods based on economic theory (e.g., Zhang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014) . The explanatory variables in these regression models are related to labor, culture, capital, and policy characteristics. In addition, as the hotel industry is closely linked to the real estate industries, which are significantly driven by economic conditions and external events, factors that affect these industries should be included in the analysis of the location of hotels (e.g., Yang et al., 2012) . For instance, Porter and Tarrant (2001) identified and examined inequalities in federal tourism sites and campsites in Southern Appalachia based on five socioeconomic variables including race, education, household income, occupation, and local heritage.",

Tourism accommodation comprises a bundle of private attributes located in a specific physical environment which embeds public attributes, such as natural environment, public safety or cultural heritage (Albert et al., 2014) . Seul (2015) found that hotels compete with more distant neighbors of similar quality than those who are quality-differentiated. In addition, the results also suggest possibility of cooperation among neighboring hotels similar in quality. To increase the demand, hotels are likely to be located in places that are proximate to their potential markets. They are usually highly clustered so as to obtain benefits from agglomeration effects. Barros (2005) found that hotels close to their potential markets are more efficient than their counterparts that have poor accessibility. A model proposed by Yokeno (1968) indicated that in a mono-centric city, spatial centrality is observed among hotels, due to the large demand for accommodation in the city center such as the central business district (CBD) or the tourist district (Yokeno, 1968; Shoval, 2006) . Weaver (1993) argued that this is because tourists prefer a location where a variety of services are available.",

This was supported by Rigall-I- Fluvi\u00e0 (2007, 2011) , who pointed out that hotel products and other tourism-related products can be viewed as bundles of public and private characteristics or attributes, and that the public attributes include characteristics of public good, such as non-rivalry and nonexcludability (Samuelson, 1954) . Some examples of attributes that contribute to the public good include, but are not limited to, environmental quality, public safety, public infrastructure availability, and cultural diversity. Therefore, these attributes and services are believed to influence both the tourists' utility functions on the demand side and the tourism agents' production functions on the supply side (Rigall-I-Torrent and Fluvi\u00e0, 2007) . Rigall-I- Fluvi\u00e0 (2007, 2011) argued that the supply of attributes related to the public good and services influence hotel's room rates, and hence, generate higher revenue for hotels near rich public infrastructures. Based on this argument, hotels are likely to choose locations with a high rate of public good and an abundant supply of services.",

We selected Hong Kong as an example because Hong Kong is a typical urban tourism destination. Tourism in Hong Kong has developed dramatically since 1957, when the Hong Kong Tourist Association (now known as the Hong Kong Tourism Board) was constituted, and the city has now established itself as an internationally renowned destination. According to the most recent statistics released by Euro monitor International (2013)the world's leading independent provider of business intelligence on industries, countries, and consumers -Hong Kong was ranked as the top city tourism destination in 2011. One of the major characteristics of tourism in urban areas is that it is only one of many functions fulfilled by a city. Tourists share or compete with local residents for many spaces and services (Hammes, 1994) and the competition is particularly intense in Hong Kong which has scarce resources. Unlike many other urban tourism destinations, Hong Kong's compact nature restricts its capacity to expand to suburban areas, and all development is confined to the limited land available. This makes Hong Kong a suitable place to conduct the study as the spatial and functional association between tourism-related phenomena and their surrounding environment is more evident and intense.",

Cities compete for the opportunity to host events that draw large crowds of visitors because such visitors tend to spend a great deal in hotels and restaurants. As Hong Kong's hosting of the equestrian competitions at the 2008 Olympic Games may have affected the spatial distribution of star hotels, the influence of mega-events is also explored in this research. It should be pointed out that some factors such as socio-economic variables that may also affect the spatial distribution of hotels are not included in the model.

The transformation from a paper map to a digitized vector map was performed using ENVI, which is the premier software for processing and analyzing geospatial imagery. As mentioned above, previous studies have found that commercial and traffic land use types may have significant close relationships with hotel locations. Hence, this study focuses on these two land use types and broadly divided the land use data into three categories (commercial, traffic, and other). The area surrounding each hotel is defined using buffers with a 500-m, 1000-m, or 1500-m radii. By overlaying land use and buffers with GIS data, we are able to derive the land utilization in the environment surrounding each hotel.

The probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled, as a function of the explanatory (predictor) variables, using a logistic function. Frequently (and subsequently in this study) \"logistic regression\" is used to refer specifically to a problem in which the dependent variable is binary; problems with more than two categories are referred to as multinomial logistic regressions or, if the multiple categories are ordered, as ordered logistic regressions. Logistic regression measures the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables, which are usually (but not necessarily) continuous, by using probability scores as the predicted values of the dependent variable.

Growth peaks of upper-grade hotels are observed in , 2001 . Of the 199 hotels that existed in 2010, 106 are upper-grade and 93 are lower-grade hotels. Fig. 2 shows the spatial distribution of hotels in 2010. Visually, the hotels concentrate in the central districts (e.g., the Yau Tsing Mong and Wan Chai Districts). The hotel locations reveal two main trends. First, there is continuous development in the central business district (CBD). Second, the hotels are expanding into surrounding districts. This pattern is related to the urban structure of Hong Kong. Older urban areas of Hong Kong are to the north of Hong Kong Island and Tsim Sha Tsui; between 1973 and 1990 Hong Kong began to develop nine new towns to cope with population growth. Due to the limited land resources, a large part of the rural land cannot be easily changed to other land use types (e.g., cargo port back-up or large development areas). Thus, urban areas have grown slowly since 1990 and the city now has a relatively stable spatial pattern (Fig. 2) .",

In the correlation matrix of independent variables, correlation coefficient between NMTR and S AN is 0.39, which is the biggest of all the correlation coefficients. In order to confirm this conclusion, tolerance is used to test multicollinearity among the variables. The results show that the minimum value of tolerance is 0.335, which is still higher than the lower limit value 0.1. Hence, the logit regression could perform as multicollinearity among the variables being acceptable. Table 2 presents the estimation results of models in selected years. As expected, the results of all of the models consistently show that the CLA is statistically significant, indicating that shopping and business facilities play important roles in determining the location of upper-grade hotels. As for the variables capturing the location attributes, the negative coefficient of AN suggests that the level of hotel has a negative relationship with the distance to attractions, perhaps because it is difficult for investors to establish hotels near natural and cultural attractions due to the resources constraint policies in Hong Kong. Upper-grade hotels are more likely than lower-grade hotels to be closer to the commercial and business areas, rather than to attractions, suggesting that business facilities and shopping play an important role in determining the location of upper-grade hotels in Hong Kong. However, the negative coefficient of S AN, which represents distance to shopping attractions, suggests that super shopping centers impose exclusivity obligations and thus investors cannot change land use in surrounding areas to build upper-grade hotels. It also can be inferred that the upper-grade hotels are located closer to secondary level shopping malls than to super shopping centers.",

To predict the possible location of new uppergrade hotels, we assign a set of random circles with 1000 meters radii to identify high density commercial and business areas and repeatedly scan all of Hong Kong. The circles in Fig. 3 delineate possible future locations of upper-grade hotels, calculated using the floating catchment area method (FCA) (Morrill and Earickson, 1968) . These circles can be regarded as a \"constraint window\". Most hotels are located in this window due partly to land use policies that result in a much stronger hotel agglomeration effect, as land is limited. Because of the tourism demand, competition or cooperation between hotels in Hong Kong is stronger than in other cities.",

            "text": "It is also interesting to note that TLA and NMTR are not statistically significant. The results show that there is no difference between lower-grade and upper-grade hotels in terms of traffic accessibility. Hong Kong has highly convenient transport facilities giving each hotel access to potential tourism markets without needing extra accessibility. Thus traffic accessibility might not be an important consideration for establishing upper-grade hotels in cities with highly convenient transport facilities. The discrete choice model explains hotel location choice based on the economic principle of utility maximization. It suggests that when hotel investors are facing a spectrum of choices of different locations, they are going to pick the most desirable location to maximize its associated utility subject to certain constraints (Yang et al., 2014) . The non-significance of the land use diversification indicator (LUD) shows that the establishment and operation of upper-grade hotels are not dependent on diversity of land use. Compared to the significance of CLA, the non-significance of GFA is interesting. CLA is the area of land zoned for commercial use surrounding hotels, whereas GFA is the gross floor area for commercial use in a TPU. Theoretically, both of them should be strongly correlated as the former is the basis of the latter. The difference might be partly attributed to the way we collected the data. The GFA data are collected at the TPU level. Upper-grade hotels may be established in the most prosperous parts of a TPU, where commercial land is clustered, making the relationship between CLA and hotel location significant. When calculating GFA, we not only include the floor space of commercial and business buildings, but also some residential buildings, because in Hong Kong many buildings have shops on the lower floors and dwellings on the higher floors. These types of shops might not be any more attractive to upper-grade hotels than to lower-grade hotels. Furthermore, many shop owners rent space on higher floors to operate shops, the so-called \"Upstairs Shops.\" Obviously, tourists are unlikely to purchase goods in these shops.",

Our findings show that in 2006, commercial area had the closest spatial association with uppergrade hotels, indicating that most upper-grade hotels are located in commercial areas. In addition, as the effect of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) gave rise to atypical travel and spending patterns in 2003, there was a low growth rate in new hotels established in 2003 (see Fig. 1 ). This trend is not seen in the spatial patterns of hotels and their surrounding environments, indicating that the spatial pattern in the development of hotels is not sensitive to mega-events.",

This indicates that the spatial pattern of hotels and their surrounding environments is stable within the 1000-m buffer. However, when the buffer radius is increased from 1000 m to 2000 m, the coefficients change significantly. Perhaps, when establishing a hotel, an investor focuses on the spatial structure within a certain distance (around 1000 m) of a hotel, but once established, the concrete jungle blocks the propagation of the spatial pattern beyond that limit.

The second, neglected by most previous research, is a temporal analysis of the relationship between hotels and the built environment after the hotels are built. The results reveal that after a certain period of operation, the spatial structure of hotels and their surrounding built environments are significantly changed within a certain radius. Although this research is not able to directly examine how a hotel's operation influences the surrounding built environment, the significant temporal variation in the relationship between the dependent and independent variables such as the commercial land use may partly suggest that hotels influence the built environment in the surrounding area.",
