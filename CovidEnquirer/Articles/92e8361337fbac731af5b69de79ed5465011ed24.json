TGEV has three structural proteins: the spike protein (S), the nucleoprotein (N), and the membrane (M) protein (Spaan et a/., 1988 (Spaan et a/., , 1990 Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst, 1991) . The S protein forms the peplomers of the virus and consists of 1447 or 1449 amino acids, depending on the viral strain (Rasschaert and Laude, 1987; Jacobs et a/., 1987; Wesley, 1990; Britton et al., 1990) . Several biological activities have been associated with the S protein: (i) It is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies and is involved in protection (Garwes et a/., 1978; Jimenez et a/., 1986; Delmas et a/., 1986) ; (ii) it includes the receptor binding site and determines viral tropism (Holmes eta/., 1981; Collins et a/., 1982; Sut% eta/., 1990) ; (iii) it is involved in pathogenicity (Taguchi and Fleming, 1989) ; (iv) it may induce ' To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed. cell fusion (Collins et al., 1982; Sturman et a/., 1985; DeGroot et al., 1989) ; and (v) it has hemagglutinating activity (Holmes et a/., 1989) .",

Three of the antigenic sites overlap with sites described by others (Delmas et al., 1990; .

This strain was cloned five times in our laboratory. The procedure for TGEV neutralization has been described (Correa et al., 1988) . The neutralization index was defined as the log,,, of the ratio of the PFU after incubating the virus in presence of medium or the indicated MAb. The virus was purified as described (Correa et a/., 1988) or partially purified from supernatants of infected cultures. In the latter case, partially purified virus was collected when a CPE of 10 to 50% was observed, by clarification at 6 X 1 O3 rpm (Sorvall GS3 rotor) for 20 min followed by sedimenta-tion at 25 X 1 O3 rpm (Sorvall AH627 rotor) for 1.5 hr at 4\".

Stocks of TGEV PUR46-CCl20-MAD were enriched in the manb lD.Bl2 variants by binding wt virions with the MAb 1 D.Bl2 and depleting the virus-antibody complexes with S. aureus coated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins.

Only plaques caused by PUR46 wt were stained by MAb lD.Bl2, while all plaques were positive with MAb 3B.B6 specific for the N protein (results not shown). This results confirmed that manb 1 D.Bl2 mutants were not recognized by the MAb used in their selection.

            "text": "Site A Site A is located on the surface of TGEV and is dependent on intracellular glycosylation. With one exception all mutants mapping at site A had a single nucleotide difference with the parental virus. This change was most probably responsible for the virus escaping from MAb neutralization. In other viral systems, single nucleotide differences have also been found to be responsible for escape from neutralization (Vandepol et al., 1986; Taniguchi et al., 1988; Wiegers et al., 1990) . In the mar 1 B.B5 mutant, and in those variants derived from this virus, two nucleotide differences were detected which caused amino acid changes in residues 543 and 631 (Table 1) . The change at position 543 is probably responsible for the escape from MAb 1 B.B5, since MAb 1 A.FlO, which maps to the same antigenic subsite, binds peptides including amino acid 543 ( Fig.  3 and results not shown) . The change affecting residue 631 could be an accompanying mutation, although its contribution to the epitope lB.B5 cannot be discounted. Site A contains three subsites, Aa, Ab, and AC, which are sensitive to substitutions on the residues 538, 591, and 543, respectively. In addition, residue 586 affects both subsites Aa and Ab. These data show that site A is complex and that it is formed by residues located in distal segments of the S glycoprotein. This seems to be the most frequent situation in epitopes from other systems studied in detail (site B reported in this manuscript; DiMarchi et al., 1986; Parry et a/., 1989; Davies et al., 1988; Posthumus et al., 1990; Wiegers et al., 1990) . Although we have defined precise amino acids contributing to the different antigenic sites, the participation of other residues to the antigenicity of the subsites is not excluded.",

Effect of the pH and temperature on the relative surface exposure of antigenic sites A and C. Purified TGEV was incubated at different pH (at 4\") (A) or temperature (B). Dilutions of the virus were used to inhibit the binding of site A-(6A.C3) and C (GA.AG)-specific MAbs to TGEV-coated plates (0.25 rglwell) in a cRIA, as described previously (Correa et al., 1988) . A binding inhibition curve was obtained for each viral sample after different incubations. The percentage of binding inhibition by 5 pg of virus per well was divided by ten and taken as the relative exposure of the sites. After each treatment the residual infectivity was determined in a plaque assay on ST cells. formed by at least three epitopes. Two of these epitopes (lD.Bl2 and lB.Hll) are overlapping, since both include amino acid Trp at position 97 in their formation. Sequence analysis of mutants indicated that residues 97 and 144 (Table 4 ) are part of site B. Although site B is conformation dependent, MAbs specific for this site can bind TGEV S-glycoprotein by immunoblotting providing that the samples were not treated with 2-mercaptoethanol. Most probably, renaturation of S protein occurs during the blotting of the protein to nitrocellulose paper. Recently, we used a new approach to characterize conformation-dependent epitopes (Lenstra et al., 1991) . Using MAb lD.Bl2, we screened a bacterial pEX expression library of hybrid proteins that consist of P-galactosidase and random hexapeptides. Sequencing of antigenic clones revealed the sequence: -ANSRPRWMKL-(bold residues were expressed by the variable insert of the plasmid). This sequence mimics the epitope of MAb 1 D.Bl2 and may be considered a site B-mimotope (Geysen et al., 1984) . The three underlined residues are also found in the S protein sequence 102-&@HN&/T-96, suggesting that residues 97, 100, and 102 may be part of site B. These residues might have been displayed in a correct spatial conformation, which mimics the native site, by the contiguous residues present in the mimotope. The serine in position 144 also contributes to site B, since it is changed in the mar 1 B.Hl 1 mutant (Table 4 ). It is tempting to speculate that the serine present in the mimotope (-ANSRPRWMKL-) replaces the serine in position 144 of the parental virus. 8 . Summary of the amino acids contributing to the antigenic sites of the S glycoprotein of two clones of the PUR46 strain of TGEV, and of the properties of the antigenic sites. The diagram shows the position of the residues involved in the formation of the antigenic sites of two clones of the PUR46 virus with a common origen (Bohl, 1972) . The antigenic sites were defined by competitive binding assays with MAbs and named according to Correa et Delmas et al. (1990) ; and (d) Sanchez et al. (1990) . A site was defined as conserved (+) if at least part of it was present in most of the isolates. Sites with a minor presence or which were completely absent in certain isolates were referred as + or -. of the virus with 2.5% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol ( Fig. 7 ; Correa et a/., 1990); (ii) it is represented by synthetic nonapeptides derived from TGEV S-glycoprotein (Fig. 5) ; (iii) it is present in recombinant products expressed in bacteria, which do not reconstitute the native S protein (Correa eta/., 1990) ; and (iv) it is formed in the absence of glycosylation (Fig. 7) . Since nonapeptides with the sequence (-P-P-N-S-D-V-) are strongly bound by MAbs 5B.Hll and 6A.A6 under denaturing conditions, this peptide can be used as a reporter to control the expression of the spike protein gene or other heterologous genes. In addition, because binding and sequencing studies indicate that site C is not present in the respiratory variants of TGEV (Sanchez et a/., 1990); C. M. Sanchez and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results) , this peptide could be useful to discriminate serum from TGEV or PRCV infected animals.",
