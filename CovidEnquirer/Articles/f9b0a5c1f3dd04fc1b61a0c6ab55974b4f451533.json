The total Australian population is approximately 20.2 million, 1 predominantly urban and the majority descended from the European migration in the last 200 years. Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) have inhabited the continent for at least 4000 years and comprise 2.5% of the total population. 1 The majority of Indigenous Australians live in deprived socio-economic circumstances, often in remote rural locations.

In addition, Australia currently accepts 12000 refugees under a humanitarian program and many more from refugee-like backgrounds under family reunification programs. 3 The epidemiology of respiratory infections in this population is related to the country of origin or transit, PAEDIATRIC RESPIRATORY REVIEWS (2005) Summary The burden of pneumonia in Australian children is significant with an incidence of 5-8 per 1000 person-years. Pneumonia is a major cause of hospital admission in children less than 5 years of age. Indigenous children are at particular risk with a 10-20-fold higher risk of hospitalisation compared to non-Indigenous children. They also have longer admissions and are more likely to have multiple admissions with pneumonia. There are limited data on pathogen-specific causes of pneumonia, however Streptococcus pneumonia is the most common bacterial cause in children under 5 years of age and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are the predominant viral causes in young children. Pneumonia due to Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) has been virtually eliminated by the introduction of universal Hib immunisation. Further studies are needed to accurately define the epidemiology of pneumonia due to specific pathogens to help target treatment and immunisation strategies. \u00df 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The epidemiology of childhood respiratory infections partly reflects these differences, with familiar pathogens occurring frequently throughout the country, but with high incidences of bacterial pneumonia amongst Indigenous Australians and less familiar pathogens, such as meliodosis, occurring in the Northern Territory. The close proximity to South-east Asia has led to concern (to date largely unfulfilled) of the potential spread to Australia of 'new' respiratory diseases, such as Avian Influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 5",

In 1907 the mortality rate across all ages from all infectious diseases was 258.9 per 100000 population; 90 years later it was 7.2 per 100000. 6 Similar trends are evident in children and are attributed to improvements in sanitation, vaccination and the introduction of antibiotics. In 1996 communicable diseases accounted for 3% of the total disease burden in Australia. 6 However, in children infections contribute significantly more to the burden of childhood diseases, although there are no national data. Respiratory infections have also declined substantially over the same time period. 6 Australia (particularly in Western Australia) has an impressive resource of linked health-related databases, which provide detailed data on the overall epidemiology of children hospitalised with pneumonia. Clearly any data relating to the aetiology of pneumonia should be interpreted with a certain degree of caution, as the discharge diagnosis of pneumonia is usually made on clinical and/or radiological grounds, without microbiological confirmation of the aetiology. 7 Much of the Australian epidemiological data spans a period where rapid diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens was not available and diagnostic labels such as 'bronchitis' were more commonly applied than they are currently. However these studies provide useful insights into the overall burden of pneumonia in Australian children.",

For all children, low or high birth weight, male sex and measures of social disadvantage (young or unmarried mothers or rural location) were significant risk factors for admission. 8 Between 1988 and 1993 in Western Australia, there were 53311 admissions to hospital with respiratory diseases in children aged up to 14 years, of which 4293 (8.1%) were for pneumonia (Table 1 ). 9 Pneumonia was second only to asthma as the most frequent admission diagnosis in children beyond one year of age. In Indigenous children, the rate of pneumonia was 10-20 times higher than non-Indigenous children (Table 1) . 9 More recent and partially overlapping data from Western Australia have examined the burden of childhood pneumonia in the first two years of life in all children born between 1990 and 2000 (K. Carville, D. Lehmann, R. Richmond, N. De Klerk and D. Burgner, unpublished results). In this cohort of 270068 singleton live births (17366 Indigenous births, 252702 non-Indigenous births), pneumonia accounted for 4518 hospital admissions, equivalent to 5.8% of all admissions with an infectious diagnosis. Almost half of admissions with pneumonia in the first two years of life were in Indigenous children, in whom pneumonia accounted for 12.2% of all infectious diagnoses. Not only was pneumonia far more common in Indigenous children ( Fig. 1 ), these children were three times more likely than non-Indigenous children to have multiple admissions with this diagnosis. Indigenous children with pneumonia also had a longer hospital stay than non-Indigenous children, possibly reflecting more severe disease and logistic difficulties with returning families to their remote locations.",

In Australia, the majority of data relates to pneumococcal pneumonia with bacteraemia in children from the National enhanced invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) surveillance program. 18 introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was 17.4 per 100000 population, representing 37% of cases of IPD in this age group. 18 The proportion of IPD associated with pneumonia in Indigenous children was much higher (72%) compared to non-indigenous children (31%). The overall incidence of BPP in Indigenous children was approximately 15-fold higher than in non-indigenous children under 5 years of age. The serotypes responsible for IPD were more varied in Indigenous children, with approximately 55% being due to the seven serotypes in the licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar TM ) compared to 86% in non-Indigenous children under 2 years of age. BPP figures clearly underestimate the true burden of pneumococcal pneumonia. In undertaking a cost-effectiveness analysis of PCV in Australian children, Butler and colleagues estimated the incidence of moderate or severe pneumococcal pneumonia to be 100 per 100000 persons in children under 5 years. 19 Vaccine efficacy studies also provide an estimate of the burden of disease. In the PCV efficacy study in northern California, the incidence of chest X-ray proven pneumonia was reduced by 17.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.8-28.9%) in the intention to treat analysis 20 and a similar level of efficacy was seen in a study of 9-valent PCV in South Africa (25% in HIV negative children). 21 The impact of universal PCV in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children is awaited with interest.",

The epidemiology of bacteraemic Hib pneumonia in Indigenous children is similar to that in developing countries 25 suggesting that Hib was responsible for approximately 20% of severe pneumonia in Indigenous children prior to Hib vaccination. Following the introduction of conjugate Hib vaccines, the incidence of bacteraemic Hib pneumonia has dramatically decreased in both populations. 26 ",

Of the 138 individuals in Australia investigated during this period, 111 had 'suspect' and 27 'probable' infection; five of the latter group were reported to the WHO as likely cases, after other diagnoses were excluded. 5 None of these were children, but given the significant paediatric morbidity reported from neighbouring countries, 57 there is the potential for SARS becoming a significant paediatric infection in Australia.",

Whilst Australian children suffer from a range of pathogens similar to those experienced by children in industrialised countries in the Northern Hemisphere, there are several important caveats. In tropical Australia, unusual pathogens are encountered and there is the additional risk posed by imported respiratory infections from neighbouring countries. Indigenous Australians bear a hugely disproportionate burden of many diseases and have a much higher incidence of pneumonia compared to non-Indigenous children. The introduction of conjugate Hib vaccines decreased the burden of Hib pneumonia in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children highlighting the importance of vaccination in reducing the burden of pneumonia.",
