At the time of the quarantine, China was already 2 weeks into the 40-day Spring Festival, during which several billion people travel throughout China to celebrate the Lunar New Year (4) . Considering the timing of exported COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, we estimate that only 8.95% (95% CrI 2.22% -28.72%) of cases infected in Wuhan by January 12 might have been confirmed by January 22, 2020. By limiting our estimate to infections occurring \u226510 days before the quarantine, we account for an estimated 5-6-day incubation period and 4-5 days between symptom onset and case detection (3, 5, 6, 8) (Appendix). The low detection rate coupled with an average lag of 10 days between infection and detection (6) suggest that newly infected persons who traveled out of Wuhan just before the quarantine might have remained infectious and undetected in dozens of cities in China for days to weeks. Moreover, these silent importations already might have seeded sustained outbreaks that were not immediately apparent.",

Both estimates are consistent with a recent epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 cases confirmed in Wuhan (8) . By assuming these rates of early epidemic growth, we estimate that 130 cities in China have \u226550% chance of having a COVID-19 case imported from Wuhan in the 3 weeks preceding the quarantine (Figure) . By January 26th, 107 of these high-risk cities had reported cases and 23 had not, including 5 cities with importation probabilities >99% and populations >2 million: Bazhong, Fushun, Laibin, Ziyang, and Chuxiong. Under our lower bound estimate of 6.26 days for the doubling time, 190/369 cities lie above the 50% threshold for importation. Our risk assessment identified several cities throughout China likely to be harboring yet undetected cases of COVID-19 a week after the quarantine, suggesting that early 2020 ground and rail travel seeded cases far beyond the Wuhan region under quarantine.",

To design our mobility model, we used data from Tencent (https://heat.qq.com), a major social media company that hosts applications, including WeChat (\u22481.13 billion active users in 2019) and QQ (\u2248808 million active users in 2019) (9) ; consequently, our model might be demographically biased by the Tencent user base. Further, considerable uncertainty regarding the lag between infection and case detection remains. Our assumption of a 10-day lag is based on early estimates for the incubation period of COVID-19 (8) and prior estimates of the lag between symptom onset and detection for SARS (10) . We expect that estimates for the doubling time and incidence of COVID-19 will improve as reconstructed linelists and more granular epidemiologic data become available (Appendix). However, our key qualitative insights likely are robust to these uncertainties, including extensive pre-quarantine COVID-19 exportations throughout China and far greater case counts in Wuhan than reported before the quarantine. imposed on January 23, 2020. a) Daily travel volume to and from Wuhan, given as a percentage of the Wuhan population.
