However, there are no effective strategies for controlling the IB virus (IBV) at present. Therefore, development of novel antiviral treatment strategies is urgently required. As reported, astragalus polysaccharides (APS) have potential antiviral effects against several viruses; however, the antiviral effect of APS against IBV remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether APS had the potential to inhibit IBV infectionby utilizing several in vitro experimental approaches. To this end, the effect of APS on the replication of IBV was examined in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. Viral titers were calculated by using the plaque formation assay, and the cytotoxicity of APS was tested by utilizing a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The expression of viral mRNA and cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1) mRNA transcripts was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR(qRT-PCR). IBV titers in infected CEK cells treated with APS were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that APS inhibited IBV replication in vitro. We also found that the decreased viral replication after APS treatment was associated with reduced mRNA levels of the cytokines IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1. In conclusion, these results suggest that APS exhibit antiviral activities against IBV and it may represent a potential therapeutic agent for inhibiting the replication of IBV.",

More than 50 serotypes of IBV have been documented since the first virus was isolated from birds exhibiting respiratory symptoms in the United States in 1931 [3] . Extensive genetic diversity of IBV strains worldwide renders vaccines largely ineffective, because of poor or no cross-protection between different IBV serotypes [4, 5] . Thus, finding an effective antiviral drug or agent is imperative for the prevention of IBV infection.",

Several reports have confirmed that traditional Chinese herbs effectively inhibit the replication of various viruses [6] [7] [8] . Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), isolated from a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, Astragalus mongholicus, have been widely used immunopotentiators [9] [10] [11] . Recently, several studies have shown that supplementation with APS can inhibit replication of several animal viruses, including H9N2 avian influenza virus [12] , foot and mouth disease virus [13] , Newcastle disease virus [14] , and infectious bursal disease virus [15] . However, the effect of APS on IBV replication remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the antiviral effects ofAPS against IBV by utilizing several in vitro approaches. serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine in a humidified chamber, supplemented with 5% CO 2, at 37\u00b0C.
