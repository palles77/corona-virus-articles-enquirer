Most of the 230 OTUs observed in this unusual small shallow temporal pond, are part 412 of the rare biosphere and form a stable core community. Within this core, we observed halophiles 413 and methanogens, but also spatially unexpected archaeal taxa, that thrive under high salt 414 concentrations. We also observed a transient rare biosphere that appears to be enriched under dry 415 environmental conditions, suggesting seasonal dynamics shaping community assemblage. 416",

A possibility is that the fluctuating environment in AD are 263 part of the community dynamics increasing possible niches, and it has been observed within CCB in 264 other fluctuating environments that harbor large diversity due to local adaptations to each condition 265 [37, 74]. However, the AD mat is peculiar because Archaea are more abundant and diverse than in 266 other fluctuating microbialites within CCB [62] (Table 1). Moreover, this is the first site where 267 there is a constant microbial core despite the environmental fluctuations among seasons. Not only 268 Archaea diversity within AD is relatively constant, it is also considerably large for a metagenomic 269 study using the Illumina platform [75]. 270 On the other hand, targeted clone libraries for Archaean primers have revealed a high 271 abundance of Archaea (~10%) in stromatolites communities of the Hammelin Pool in SharkBay, 272 Australia, which reaches one of the highest archaeal abundances. However, such archaeal 273 community was represented by 27 archaeal clones, out of 176 total of 16S rRNA clone library from 274 a single sample point [76]. These numbers are hard to compare to our observed AD archaeal 275 diversity due to different experimental approaches.

However, previously 289 studied localities within CCB displaying the same low energy stress, such as Pozas Rojas microbial 290 mat, lack similar numbers of Archaea.

More metagenomic 331 studies are in their way to explore such pattern in a longer time frame. 332It should not be discarded that the lowest-abundant taxa of AD could be undergoing 333 dormancy, a mechanism that maintains cells alive, but inactive and intermittently below detection334 thresholds [89]. Indeed, Archaea can enter a cellular dormant state [89-91], thereby providing an 335 adaptive response to what would otherwise be a deleterious environmental perturbation. This has 336 been experimentally studied analyzing the thermoacidophile archaeon Metallosphaera prunae that 337 produces VapC toxins that drive cellular dormancy under uranium stress [92]. Another factor for 338 dormancy in Archaea is predatory organisms, specifically, virus, which are abundant in the AD 339 metagenomes (~28%). As an example, a research group showed that rare and even inactive viruses, 340 induce dormancy in the model archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus [90]. Also oligotrophy might be 341 playing a role in Archaea dormancy, as dormant bacteria taxa have been found to be enriched in 342 low phosphorus environment [89] and dormant microorganisms can also escape virus predation 343[93]. Considering the extremely skew stoichiometry, virus may be the drivers of the community 344 structure, not only liberating immobilized nutrients to the system by lysing cells, but by maintaining 345 a large panoply of rare taxa coexisting and avoiding predation.",

This type of hypersaline 354 environments is very dynamic and wide spread in the world [98]. 355 In our sampling site, halophilic and methanogenic Archaea are proposed to constitute the 356 stable core of the AD during hypersaline conditions under the salt crust.

These studies have demonstrated that saline sediments contain communities with 360 higher unique biodiversity values in comparison with other environments [99].

Halophilic and methanogen species coexisted 369 within the microbial mat, along with some unexpected genera belonging to Euryarchaeota phylum. 370 Among the latter we can find, Thermococcus, Natronomonas, Picrophylus, Archaeoglobus, 371 Aciduliprofundum and even Thermoplasma, a lineage that lacks a cell wall. These microorganisms 372 are mostly reported from hydrothermal vents, displaying a high level of tolerance to low and high 373 temperatures and a wide range of pH [100, 101]. The presence of these taxa along with the 374 previous observations, adds evidence to our proposal stating that CCB microbial communities have 375 both marine and magmatic affinities [30, 32]. Therefore, the Archaea that we observed in AD are 376 witness of both environments, the deep aquifer propelled by magmatic heat within the mountain of 377 San Marcos y Pinos [29], and the surface life, where photosynthesis occurs, rarely, after rainy days. Hence, part of the AD diversity might have emerged from the deep sediments that contained the 379",
