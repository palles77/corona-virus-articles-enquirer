Their structures were established based on NMR, HRE-SIMS, and MS-MS spectroscopic interpretation as well as by chemical degradation. Both streptodepsipeptides P11A and P11B inhibited proliferation of different glioma cell lines, with IC 50 values ranging from 0.1 mM to 1.4 mM. Streptodepsipeptide P11A was found to block the cell cycle at the G 0 /G 1 phase and induce apoptosis in glioma cells. Further investigation demonstrated that streptodepsipeptide P11A downregulated expression of HK2, PFKFB3, PKM2, GLS, and FASN, important tumor metabolic enzymes. Data from this study suggested that targeting multiple tumor metabolic regulators might be one antiglioma mechanism of streptodepsipeptide P11A. A possible mechanism for this class of streptodepsipeptides is reported herein.",

Therefore, chemotherapy has played a more important role in treatment and prevention of gliomas. However, so far very few drugs have been approved for treating gliomas including temozolomide (TMZ), carmustine, and lomustine. Of these, only TMZ has been independently used for treatment of gliomas. Furthermore, most current anti-glioma drugs are cytotoxicity-based alkylating agents with limited efficacy and serious side-effects (Chamberlain, 2010; Mittal et al., 2015) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover lead compounds for development of novel anti-glioma drugs. Marine-derived natural products are important sources for discovery of new anticancer drug leads (Newman and Cragg, 2014; Petit and Biard, 2013; Schumacher et al., 2011) .",

There are several important regulators (enzymes) in the glycolytic pathway, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) (Vander Heiden, 2011; Wolf et al., 2011) , 6phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) (Kessler et al., 2008; Vander Heiden, 2011) , and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) (Kefas et al., 2010; Vander Heiden, 2011) , that have been shown to be up-regulated in the glioma cells. These specific regulators are preferentially used by cancer cells (Vander Heiden, 2011) . Glutamine metabolism (Daye and Wellen, 2012; Ru et al., 2013) and lipid metabolism Ru et al., 2013; Santos and Schulze, 2012) have also been found to be largely altered in cancer cells. Both glutaminase (GLS, a key enzyme of glutaminolysis) (Daye and Wellen, 2012; Lu et al., 2010; Ru et al., 2013) and fatty acid synthase (FASN, a key lipogenic enzyme) (Menendez and Lupu, 2007; Ru et al., 2013) are up-regulated in gliomas. Accumulated studies have demonstrated that the above mentioned metabolic enzymes are promising targets for discovery of novel anticancer drugs.",

            "text": "Compound 1 was proved to be the known cyclodepsipeptide valinomycin based on its NMR and HRESIMS data, melting point, optical rotation value, the analysis of its acidic hydrolysates by chiral HPLC and GC analyses, and the comparison with literature data (Pettit et al., 1999; Tabeta and Saito, 1985) . Valinomycin (1) was previously isolated from several Streptomyces species (Heisey et al., 1988; Lim et al., 2007; Park et al., 2008; Pettit et al., 1999) and is well known to enhance the K \u00fe permeability of several membrane systems including mitochondria, erythrocytes, and lipid bilayers (Bhattacharyya et al., 1971; Haynes et al., 1969) . This cyclodepsipeptide was also reported to have activities against tumors, bacteria, fungi (Lim et al., 2007; Park et al., 2008; Pettit et al., 1999) , and severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (Wu et al., 2004) . Valinomycin (1) is composed of four units of D-valine (D-Val), L-valine (L-Val), D-a-hydroxyisovaleric acid (D-Hiv), and Llactate (L-Lac) with a trimer structure of cyclo-(D-Val-L-Lac-L-Val-D-Hiv) 3 . For its 13 C and 1 H NMR spectroscopic data assignments, see Table S 2 (Supplementary Data) . It was noted that each of the four units displayed characteristic NMR signals, which allowed for differentiation of the four units. The unit L-Lac was easily recognized by its NMR signals of d C 172.7 (C-1), 70.4 (C-2), 17.3 (C-3) and d H 5.32 (1H, q, J \u00bc 7.0 Hz, H-2) and 1.44 (3H, d, J \u00bc 7.0 Hz, H-3), while D-Hiv had its characteristic signals of d C 171.0 (C-1), 78.7 (C-2), 30.4 (C-3), 16.8 (C-4) and d H 5.02 (1H, d, J \u00bc 3.11 Hz, H-2). The D-Val and L-Val could be distinguished from their chemical shifts of C-1, C-2, H-2 and the coupling constant values of 3 J CH-NH . The unit D-Val was indicated by its characteristic NMR signals at d C 170.2 (C-1), 59.1 (C-2) and d H 4.10 (1H, dd, J \u00bc 10.0, 8.1 Hz, H-2), 7.88 (1H, d, J \u00bc 8.1 Hz, NH-2), as compared with their counterparts of L-Val at d C 172.0 (C-1), 60.6 (C-2) and d H 3.96 (1H, dd, J \u00bc 10.2, 6.2 Hz, H-2), 7.80 (1H, d, J \u00bc 6.2 Hz, NH-2). All of these characteristic NMR signals mentioned above are very helpful for the structure elucidation of the new compounds of streptodepsipeptides P11A (2) and P11B (3) .16 in the fifth zone was assigned to a methylene (b-CH 2 ). The remaining 20 carbons, which appeared at d C 9.41e19.92 in the sixth zone, were assigned to 20 methyls (g-CH 3 or b-CH 3 ). The 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 also showed six NH signals at d H 7.89 (d, 7.9 Hz), 7.84 (d, 6.0 Hz), 7.83 (d, 8.0 Hz), 7.83 (d, 8.0 Hz), 7.77 (d, 6.2 Hz), and 7.76 (d, 5.8 Hz) . All of the above data suggested that compound 2 was composed of 12 units, including six amide groups (amino acids) and six ester groups. Acid hydrolysis of 2 produced D-Val, L-Val, D-Hiv, L-Lac, D-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (D-Hba) as determined by chiral HPLC and GC analyses using the standard compounds as references. Detailed COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectroscopic analyses confirmed the presence of 12 units including three L-lactates, three L-valines, three D-valines, two D-a-hydroxyisovaleric acids, and one D-2hydroxybutanoic acid (D-Hba). As shown in Fig. 2 , the a-NH and a-CH protons of each valine had a COSY correlation, while the a-CH proton of each unit displayed a COSY correlation with the b-CH (or b-CH 2 for D-Hba, or b-CH 3 for L-Lac) proton, which was correlated with the g-CH 3 proton. HMBC correlations (see Table 1 and Fig. 2) further supported the structure of each unit. According to the foregoing NMR correlations and the NMR data comparison of The sequence of the 12 units of compound 2 was established based on the following HMBC and NOESY correlations (Table 1 In order to further confirm the locations of L-Val and D-Val, compound 2 was partially hydrolyzed using 3N LiOH to produce three dipeptides of L-Lac-L-Val (2a), D-Hiv-D-Val (2b), and D-Hba-D-Val (2c). The structures ( Fig. 1) of 2a, 2b, and 2c were deduced from their HRESIMS and 1 H NMR data. Further acid hydrolysis of 2a, 2b, and 2c furnished free amino acids of L-Val for 2a and D-Val for 2b and 2c, which were confirmed by chiral HPLC analysis using the standard amino acids as references.",

Both compounds 1 and 2 were isolated from strain P11-23B and might have the same overall biosynthetic pathway, suggesting 1 and 2 should have a similar sequence for the 12 units. Based on the above evidence, the structure of 2 was determined as cyclo- , and 20 methyls (d C 16.78e20.03). Acid hydrolysates of 3 were found to be D-Val, L-Val, D-Hiv, and L-Lac as determined by chiral HPLC and GC. Further detailed NMR spectroscopic analysis, in combination with the HRESIMS data, indicated that the structure of 3 was very similar to that of 2, except for another L-Lac moiety in 3 instead of the D-Hba moiety in 2. The 13 C and 1 H NMR data (Table 2) Three isolated cyclodepsipeptides (1e3) were assayed for their activity against the proliferation of four different glioma cell lines by SRB method. The results ( Fig. 3 and Table 3 ) showed that new streptodepsipeptides P11A (2) and P11B (3) had potent activity with IC 50 values of 0.3e0.4 mM for 2 and 0.1e1.4 mM for 3, while known valinomycin (1) showed much stronger antiproliferative activity with IC 50 values ranging from 7.6 to 30.0 nM, probably because of its symmetrical trimer structure (Pettit et al., 1999) . The control doxorubicin (DOX) had activity with IC 50 0.4e3.3 mM. The two new compounds were also tested for activity in inhibiting growth of normal human astrocytes (HA). As shown in Table 3 , the ratios of IC 50 for HA to glioma cells were within the ranges of 23e30 for 2 and 3e35 and for 3.",

U87-MG cells were incubated with 0.8 mM streptodepsipeptide P11A (2), DOX (0.8 mM) as positive control, or without compound treatment as negative control (CON) for 12 h and then stained with PI and subjected to flow cytometric analysis.

This alteration indicated that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) blocked U87-MG cell cycle at the G 0 /G 1 phase. Positive control DOX (0.8 mM) also had a 49.69% increasement of DNA content at the G 0 /G 1 phase. A similar result was also obtained from the streptodepsipeptide P11Atreated U251 cells ( Fig. 4 and Table 4 ). Flow cytometric analysis with annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was applied to quantify the apoptosis induced by streptodepsipeptide P11A (2). After 72 h of treatment, streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) (0.8 mM) caused an increase of 20.40% in total apoptotic cells (early and late apoptotic cells), when compared to the control (CON, Fig. 5 ).",

Therefore, the ability of streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) to enhance the K \u00fe permeability of human erythrocytes was also evaluated. Human erythrocytes were treated with tested compound (2) or positive control valinomycin (1) for 90 min.

It was found that both new cyclodepsipeptides significantly suppressed proliferation of four different glioma cell lines. Further investigation demonstrated that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) induced apoptosis in glioma cells, arrested cell cycle at the G 0 /G 1 phase, and downregulated expression levels of HK2, PFKFB3, PKM2, GLS, and FASN, the important tumor metabolic regulators of glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and lipogenesis. These results indicated that regulating multiple glioma metabolic enzymes might be one of the antitumor mechanisms of streptodepsipeptide P11A (2).

However, how streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) regulates these metabolic regulators, and what the anti-glioma activity is of this new bioactive cyclodepsipeptide in animal models, need to be further investigated.",

Determination of intracellular K \u00fe concentration (Bhattacharyya et al., 1971; Li and Yang, 2009; Lu et al., 2006) . Briefly, fresh healthy human blood was centrifugated at 660 g for 10 min at 4 C. The precipitated erythrocytes were washed with GNS (glucose and normal saline injection) buffer (50 g/L glucose and 9 g/L NaCl) and then centrifugated at 660 g for 5 min in three repeated operations. Washed erythrocytes were suspended with GNS buffer (1: 1) to make a 50% erythrocyte suspension. The prepared erythrocyte suspension (1 mL) was treated with different concentrations of tested compounds in the KCl isotonic solution (3 mL) for 90 min at 37 C. After terminating the treatment by using an ice bath for 1 min, the treated suspension was centrifuged at 660 g for 10 min. The treated erythrocytes were washed with cold GNS (3 mL) five times to remove extracellular K \u00fe , and then haemolyzed by ultrapure H 2 O at 4 C for overnight. Haemolyzed solutions were centrifuged at 10,700 g for 30 min at 4 C to give cytoplasm and cell membranes. The cell membranes were washed by ultrapure H 2 O two times (each 5 mL) to give a wash solution, which was centrifuged at 660 g for 10 min to afford a supernatant. The combination (about 13 mL) of supernatant and cytoplasm was digested by using a mixture (3 mL) of 15.99 mol/L HNO 3 and 11.65 mol/L HClO 4 (2:1, v/ v) at 140e160 C for 30 min until a clear and transparent liquid (about 1 mL) appeared. The digested solution was transferred into a volumetric flask (10 mL) and then diluted with 0.1 M HNO 3 to the full volume. The 10 mL digested solution was further diluted with 0.1 M HNO 3 by 50 times to make a final digested solution for the measurement of intracellular K \u00fe concentration by AA800 atomic absorption spectrometry. A series of accurate K \u00fe solutions were prepared with KCl to investigate calibration curve (R 2 \u00bc 0.998).
