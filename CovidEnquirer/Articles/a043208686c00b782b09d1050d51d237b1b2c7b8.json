However, this concept was abandoned more than a decade ago when it was shown that immune surveillance is indeed operative in such tissues. Even the CNS, previously considered the prototypic privileged site, is constantly patrolled by activated T lymphocytes, which can induce profound damage when they 'find' their specific antigen in the context of appropriate restriction molecules (reviewed in Ref. 2). This particular example illustrates the fact that specialized anatomic barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier 3 or the absence of lymphatic drainage, do not necessarily guarantee the absence of immune-mediated damage in these sites 4, 5 . Furthermore, it has become clear that T-cell trafficking within the CNS can be uncoupled from the development of diseases 6 and that under certain conditions, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions can give inflammatory lymphocytes access to the CNS (Ref. 7) and even provide therapeutic approaches 8 . Examples of other tissues that utilize specialized immunological defense mechanisms are the retina, the cornea, the anterior chamber of the eye, the testis, and the liver 9 . However, it is likely that in every tissue multiple factors operate that ensure rapid and gentle elimination of inflammation.",

            "text": "In 1972, Kerr and colleagues used morphological criteria to define apoptosis as a specialized form of cell death 10 . Typically, chromatin condensation and cell shrinkage occur in parallel but the integrity of the cell membrane is preserved much longer. Traditionally, apoptotic cells were identified by electron microscopy 11 , but new techniques, such as in situ tailing assays, have recently become available 12,13 that detect biochemical events associated with oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. Although apoptosis is a purely morphological term, it has an array of pathophysiological and functional implications. The importance of apoptosis for the immune system has been reviewed in detail by Cohen and colleagues 14 who have clearly differentiated apoptosis from programmed cell death, which is merely a functional term. Since the plasma membrane itself is not a primary target of apoptosis but rather provides specific signals for phagocytic cells 15 , release of proinflammatory cytoplasmic constituents is avoided. It is conceivable that in vulnerable organs, such as the CNS, the parenchyma is extremely susceptible and has low capacity for regeneration. Theoretically, apoptosis would provide an ideal, non-inflammatory mechanism to terminate the autoimmune T-cell attack in vulnerable tissues, assuring a minimum of detrimental bystander damage to the local parenchyma. Do immunologically protected sites take advantage of this mechanism of cell death?",

Our data suggest that the CNS has high potential for elimination of T-cell-dependent inflammation, whereas this mechanism is less effective in the PNS, and is almost absent in other tissues such as muscle and skin. Interestingly, several conventional and novel immunotherapeutic approaches, such as glucocorticosteroid and high-dose antigen therapy, induce T-cell apoptosis in situ. In vitro experiments suggest different scenarios for the mechanisms by which specific cellular and humoral elements in the nervous system synergize and sensitize T cells for apoptosis in vivo.We also discuss regulatory, proapoptotic mechanisms, such as the Fas-FasL system and galectin-1, that have been utilized in other tissues to mediate immune protection. EAE (Ref. 19) . On morphological grounds, they suggested that most of the apoptotic cells were oligodendrocytes or lymphocytes. Later, T-cell apoptosis was identified by Pender et al. through special preembedding techniques 20 , and by Schmied and coworkers through combining T-cell immunocytochemistry and molecular labeling techniques 21 . Using the latter approach, we also defined quantitatively the cells that underwent apoptosis in different EAE models in the Lewis rat 21 . Myelin basic protein (MBP) was used as an autoantigen. Of all cells undergoing apoptosis, 64% were identified as T lymphocytes (Fig. 1C,D) , 9% reacted with monoclonal antibodies specific for oligodendrocytes, and the remaining cells could not be stained by immunocytochemistry because they were already in an advanced stage of degeneration (Fig. 1A,B) . Apoptosis of other cell types such as macrophages occurred only to a negligible extent 21, 22 . During the time course of AT-EAE, T-cell apoptosis was rarely observed at early stages on day 4, but reached up to 49% at day 7 when animals had recovered from clinical disease (Fig. 2) . Similarly, in active EAE T-cell apoptosis was most developed when animals had recovered from disease (Fig. 2) . In the meantime T-cell apoptosis has been shown to be similar in encephalomyelitis induced by coronavirus 23 . For obvious reasons, similar systematic studies cannot be performed in human disease. However, from diagnostic brain biopsies and postmortem tissue it is known that apoptotic T cells also occur in MS lesions 24 . Results from studies in patients with acute human disseminated leukoencephalitis are expected soon.",

            "text": "To delineate better the mechanisms of apoptosis in vivo, it is important to know whether antigen-specific cells alone or also additionally recruited bystander T cells are destroyed within the CNS. T cells isolated from established EAE lesions contain only a minor fraction of MBP-specific cells (see discussion in Ref. 21) , suggesting that antigen-specific cells are preferentially removed from inflamed CNS tissue. Furthermore, local proliferation of T cells, particularly antigenspecific T cells, occurs only to a very low extent in the lesions 30 . Preferential apoptosis of MBP-reactive cells could account for these observations 31 . To investigate this further, Pender and colleagues induced EAE by a T-cell clone using the V\u24248.2 T-cell receptor, which is the predominant T-cell-receptor element in MBPinduced EAE of the Lewis rat 32 . They then characterized apoptosis and usage of the T-cell receptor in lymphocytes isolated and enriched from spinal cord 33, 34 . They found that the frequency of V\u24248.2 + T-cells was sevenfold higher in the apoptotic population than in non-apoptotic T cells. Their findings were substantiated by studies with T-cell lines that recognize ovalbumin (OVA), an antigen not present in the Lewis rat, and by experiments in which MBP-and OVA-specific T cells were transferred. These experiments confirmed that the in vitro reactivity was preserved only for non-CNS antigens like OVA. Furthermore, Pender and colleagues could not detect recirculation of V\u24248.2 + T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. This work suggests via indirect evidence that, in EAE, antigen-specific T cells that utilize the V\u24248.2 T cell receptor are the prime target for destruction by apoptosis. These interesting results might be biased by the altered density of collapsed apoptotic cells 11 , which might preclude quantitative recovery during gradient centrifugation. Indeed, the overall frequency of T-cell apoptosis in EAE is much lower than previously reported in histological studies 21 . Furthermore, there is evidence that other Tcell receptors besides V\u24248.2 are involved in reactivity to MBP (Ref. 35 ). These T cells could also be recruited to the CNS in EAE and would be overlooked in investigations that focus only on V\u24248.2 + T cells. These studies permit two potential interpretations. First, the nervous system might effectively eliminate T lymphocytes by antigen-specific mechanisms. Second, the CNS tissue might create a hostile environment that drives all T cells into apoptosis as soon as they infiltrate the parenchyma. In ongoing analyses, this question is being addressed by the induction of EAE through the transfer of MBP-specific T cells. These cells contain a stable genomic marker and thus allow unequivocal differentiation between the MBP-reactive and the secondarily recruited T cells in the lesions ( J. Bauer and H. Lassmann, pers. commun.).",

Astrocytes can present autoantigens to autoimmune T-cell lines 36 , but astrocytes are only partially competent antigen-presenting cells that are unable to trigger the complete program of T-cell activation 37 . We studied antigen-driven effects of astrocytes on T cells and evaluated the role of steroid hormones 38 . Interestingly, astrocytes exerted a suppressive effect on T-cell activation and this was mediated by cell contact. Glucocorticoids markedly augmented T-cell apoptosis when added to T-cell-astrocyte cultures during late stages of T-cell activation on day 3. However, glucocorticoids had no effect when added at earlier time points or when thymus cells were used as antigen presenters. The effect was specific since it could be inhibited by blockade of the cytosolic steroid receptor through the action of RU486.

Interestingly, steroid hormones might be produced locally 40 or released systemically during the course of EAE (Ref. 41 ) and blockade of the steroid response augments the severity of EAE and reduces the extent of T-cell apoptosis in the infiltrates 42 . This might also substantiate the therapeutic use of glucocorticosteroids, which are given during acute relapses of autoimmune disorders of the nervous system (see below). The concept of imbalanced signaling of nonprofessional antigen presentation by local glial cells, however, is challenged by data obtained in the model of EAE in radiation bone-marrow chimeras 43 . In this model -owing to mismatches in the major histocompatibility complex -antigen presentation can only take place on hematogeneous inflammatory cells and macrophages that reside in the meninges and the perivascular space. In spite of the absence of antigen presentation on local microglia, astrocytes, and ependymal cells, the autoimmune encephalomyelitis that occurs following the transfer of T-cell lines is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to that in animals with the full repertoire of antigen-presenting cells 44 . Similarly, in this model we found no difference in the incidence of T-cell apoptosis compared with that in fully competent animals. Thus, imbalanced signaling by local nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells is undoubtedly one mechanism that drives T cells into the apoptotic program. This mechanism cannot, however, be sufficient alone for destruction of T cells in inflammatory brain lesions.",

This was studied in the model of AT-EAN that was induced in Lewis rats by transfer of activated, P2-specific T lymphocytes. To delineate whether the effect of steroid hormones is stage specific, two pulses of glucocorticosteroids (10 mg kg -1 body weight) were administered either after the first appearance of symptoms or at the maximum of the disease. Because of the rapid elimination of apoptotic cells 26 , rats were sacrificed 6 h later. At both time points there was a massive reduction of T-cell inflammation and an increase of T-cell apoptosis in the inflamed sciatic nerve that was four-to fivefold higher than the rate of apoptosis that occurred spontaneously in control animals. This underscores the fact that the elimination of inflammatory T cells in situ is indeed one mechanism of action in high-dose glucocorticosteroid therapy and is not stage specific. Similar results were recently reported from Penders' group, which studied the effect of glucocorticosteroid hormones in EAE (Ref. 58) .",

It is based on the observation that T-cell receptor re-engagement at an appropriate stage of the cell cycle eventually leads to T-cell apoptosis 59 . Critchfield et al. treated EAE in mice by intravenous administration of MBP (Ref. 60) . The results of in vitro experiments led them to propose that T cells are eliminated by apoptosis. We used an approach similar to that described above for glucocorticosteroid hormones to demonstrate that intravenous treatment with recombinant P2 protein can prevent clinical and histological signs of AT-EAN and active EAN of the Lewis rat, and leads to a profound increase in T-cell apoptosis in the sciatic nerve 61 (Fig. 3C-F) . Apoptotic fragments were readily engulfed by macrophages (Fig. 3B) . With regard to induction of apoptosis in AT-EAN, antigen therapy was at least as effective as treatment with steroid hormones. Interestingly, the naive P2 protein showed a much higher efficacy than the neuritogenic peptide that spans amino acids 53-78 that is recognized by these neuritogenic T-cell lines in vitro, which supports the concept that antigen presentation must occur in situ 2 and might be executed by activated Schwann cells in the PNS (Ref. 62). Since confrontation with antigen in vitro prompted an increased secretion of typical Th1 cytokines by our Th1 cell lines 61 , this argues that cytokine switching is not responsible for the induction of apoptosis. Antigen therapy might prove useful for highly specific treatment of autoimmune disorders of the nervous system, although recent reports have warned that under certain circumstances it might, in fact, exacerbate autoimmune disease 63 .",

Our data strongly suggest that destruction of T cells through apoptosis in inflammatory lesions is a phenomenon that occurs in sites that possess specific immune-defense mecha-nisms and not a general feature for clearance of autoimmune lesions. It might also explain some poorly understood features of CNS autoimmunity. First, the absence of T-cell proliferation in lesions of the nervous system 25,30 might be caused by progression of apoptosis. Furthermore, T-cell apoptosis might eliminate the first wave of MBP-reactive T cells, which are responsible for clinical disease (Fig. 4) , and thus prevent the expansion of dominant autoaggressive clones, and might form the basis for intramolecular epitope spreading 64 and exposure of cryptic epitopes during later stages of disease. T-cell apoptosis is a sophisticated, naturally occurring mechanism that confers protection of vulnerable sites from tissue damage. At present, we do not know exactly how this is achieved in vivo, but we have now begun to uncover the mechanisms in order to take advantage of its therapeutic applications.",

Recently, several lines of research have indicated that the relationship between the Ca 2+ channel and the release site might be more complex than dictated simply by its role as an ion conduit.The evidence suggests that the channel and the transmitter-release mechanism exist as a multimolecular entity and that this interaction has functional consequences, not only on the mechanism and properties of transmitter release, but also on the behavior of the presynaptic Ca 2+ channel itself. T HE ESSENTIAL FEATURES of the mechanism by which transmitter is released from the nerve terminal were well established by the late 1960s (Ref. 1): membrane depolarization leads, within fractions of a millisecond, to the opening of Ca 2+ channels, influx of Ca 2+ , fusion of secretory vesicle and cell membranes and, finally, discharge of the vesicle contents. As such, the presynaptic nerve terminal functions as a microscopic, ultrarapid electromechanical transducer, converting membrane depolarization into fusion of lipid membranes. The modern era of this research, focusing on the molecular basis of the release process, stems from two main findings: first, morphological studies, using the freeze-fracture (F-F) technique, demonstrated vesicle fusion sites along orderly particle arrays in the transmitter release face 2 and second, the short latency between Ca 2+ influx and transmitter release, detected with biophysical techniques, indicated an intimate association between the points of Ca 2+ influx and the vesicle release sites 3 . This molecular emphasis has mushroomed with the recent surge of information on nerve-terminal proteins. One interesting aspect of the organization of release sites is the finding that the Ca 2+ channel plays an important role in the nerve terminus, not only as a link between depolarization and Ca 2+ influx, but also as a molecular element of the secretory machinery itself. This review examines the role of the Ca 2+ channel as a component of the release mechanism and the use of these channels as a probe of the structure and function of the release face.",

The N-type Ca 2+ channel was the first distinct type of Ca 2+ channel that was demonstrated to be involved in transmitter release largely on the basis of blockade with the specific toxin -conotoxin GVIA (-CTx-GVIA) (Refs 5,6). More recently it has proved possible to localize N-type Ca 2+ channels directly at the transmitter release face [7] [8] [9] and to characterize their single channel properties in situ 10 (see below). A variety of types of Ca 2+ channel are utilized for transmitter release in different nerve terminals (reviewed in Ref. 11), including the P/Q-type that is blocked by the spider toxin -agatoxin-IVA (-Aga-IVA). Several studies have attempted to determine quantitatively the relative importance of different types of channel in specific nerve terminals simply on the basis of the fractional block of transmitter release using these toxins. However, this strategy should be pursued with caution since it is fraught with difficulties not only in interpretation (see Ref. 11) but also because the sensitivities of the presynaptic channels to these ligands cannot always be presumed 12 .",
