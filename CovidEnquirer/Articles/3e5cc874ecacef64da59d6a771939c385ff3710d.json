The goal of this study was to predict the gaseous pollutant transmission using computational fluid dynamics based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and baseline k-\u03c9 turbulence equations. The results indicated that ventilation rates generally increased with increasing wind speeds if the effects of buoyancy and wind were not suppressed; however, the re-entry ratio representing the proportion of expelled air re-entering other floors and the corresponding risk of infection decreased. If the source of the virus was on a central floor, the risk of infection was the highest on the floors closest to the source. Different window types were also considered for determining their effectiveness in controlling cross-transmission and infection risk, depending on the source location and driving force (e.g., buoyancy and wind).",

Natural ventilation is generally considered to be an effective solution for reducing indoor pollutants but must be carefully examined to determine its effectiveness. For example, natural ventilation may cause pollutant transmission between multistory households [3] , which can be adversely affected if they are adjacent to households with high levels of indoor pollutants [4] . Moreover, the airborne transmission may contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, as demonstrated during the worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [5] [6] [7] . The SARS virus was detected in rooms where the occupants did not carry the virus, suggesting that natural ventilation was responsible for the cross-transmission [8] . Clearly, additional efforts should be dedicated to investigate the mechanisms of pollutant cross-transmission through natural ventilation. In that regard, single-sided natural ventilation through windows that are flush with a building facade significantly increases the potential for pollutant transmission between multistory households and motivates our study [9] .",

These forces considerably impact the pollutant transmission between households in multistory buildings [9, 10] . Pollutant transmission with either buoyancy-or wind-driven airflow has been extensively studied. The methods primarily included full-scale experiments, small-scale experiments, multi-zone simulations, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Lim et al. [11, 12] used full-scale experiments and multi-zone simulations to investigate pollutant cross-transmission in a hospital. Pollutants expelled by patients on the lower floors re-entered upper floors via buoyancy-driven airflow; hence, inhibiting cross-transmission was proposed as a preventative measure. Mu et al. [13, 14] utilized wind tunnel tests and CFD simulations to evaluate the impacts of the wind direction and source location on pollutant cross-transmission via wind-driven ventilation in a multistory building. The results indicated that the cross-infection risks in leeward conditions were not always lower than those in windward conditions. Other similar studies based on experiments and simulations have examined airflow paths and the corresponding pollutant cross-transmission, as impacted by balconies [15] [16] [17] , mechanical exhaust systems [18] , and the characterization of a global Reynolds number for indoor and outdoor airflow [19] .",

Wu et al. [20] applied full-scale experiments to compare the contributions of buoyancy and wind forces during pollutant transmission between households on the same floor in a residential building. The experiments revealed that the wind force was dominant and produced more noticeable effects on the cross-transmission. The spread of pollutants from the released location to other spaces was shown to be enhanced by the ambient wind. Mao et al. [21] utilized multi-zone simulations to study the spread of pollutants via a combination of buoyancy and wind on the same and different floors. The indoor-outdoor temperature difference, ambient wind, building tightness, and source location collectively affected the pollutant cross-transmission in high-rise buildings. The pollutant concentration was reduced by 3-4 orders of magnitude on the floors above the pollutant source. Gao et al. [22] used CFD simulations to assess if wind exacerbated or suppressed the upward pollutant transmission. The results indicated that low-speed winds induced pollutants to enter upper floors, whereas high-speed winds formed an air curtain near the building facade and restricted pollutant transmission between floors. Furthermore, Mu et al. [23] used CFD to simulate the effects of solar radiation on the facade of a high-rise building and determined the impact of the facade's direction (sun-side or shade-side) on the re-entry of pollutants into the upper floors.",

It has been shown that some openings serve as a barrier (e.g., a partially opened tilt window) and effectively restrict pollutant transmission between floors, even under active ventilation conditions [4] . Gao and Lee [24] applied full-scale experiments to identify the ventilation performance of three window types and found that the performances varied based on the window types and locations. Heiselberg et al. [25] and Grabe et al. [26, 27] used small-scale experiments to further study the characteristics of jets and stratified airflows through typical windows Table 1 for dimensions). and compared the ventilation rates and airflow resistances. Wang et al. [28] utilized CFD simulations to characterize wind-driven ventilation through three window types and developed semi-empirical models to predict ventilation rates. Furthermore, Wang et al. [29, 30] numerically investigated single-sided ventilation using six window types, based on buoyancy alone and a combination of buoyancy and wind. The building thermal conditions and window ventilation depended on the window type, even when the window opening areas were identical. Recently, Larsen et al. [31] developed a new formula for predicting the airflow rate for single-sided natural ventilation, which was more accurate than the existing equations. However, the new model underestimated airflow rates compared to the CFD predictions. The review of the previous studies indicates that pollutant cross-transmission in single-sided natural ventilation driven by either buoyancy or wind alone is not a realistic scenario, but combinations of these forces need to be considered. Furthermore, the impacts of window configurations on ventilation rates have received considerable attention, whereas studies on pollutant cross-transmission and window configurations remain somewhat limited. Extending our previous study [4] , the work herein investigates gaseous pollutant cross-transmission due to buoyancy and wind for single-sided natural ventilation. The impacts of ambient wind, window configuration, and source location on pollutant cross-transmission are discussed, and new insights into cross-transmission are provided. ",

The RANS equations govern the transport of averaged flow quantities, with an appropriate turbulence model for representing a range of turbulence scales. Compared with large eddy simulation and detached eddy simulation models, the RANS-based modeling approach significantly reduces the required computational power and resources [34, 37] . Several studies have successfully employed RANS models to predict indoor and outdoor airflows in windward and leeward conditions [23, 39] . The baseline k-\u03c9 turbulence model, which is a two-equation eddy-viscosity model, was also found to yield satisfactory accuracy and stability when modeling an indoor airflow [40] . Moreover, studies have indicated that the baseline k-\u03c9 model performs better for solving flow over a back-step, which is a similar configuration to flow around a building, as compared with other two-equation eddy-viscosity models [38] . The use of the RANS and baseline k-\u03c9 models to predict the turbulent airflow will be validated in the study.",

The discretization error for the medium-to-fine mesh was 4.25% using the grid convergence index [43] , demonstrating that the solutions were not grid-dependent. The final mesh used the medium resolution for the building interior and the coarse mesh for the building exterior, for a total of 740-760 million cells for the different window cases. The computations ran on dual-node 2.6-GHz Intel Xeon processors with 64 GB of RAM.

The Archimedes number Ar, which represents the ratio of the buoyancy force to the inertial force of the ambient wind, is used to identify the dominant driving force of the natural ventilation. The wind speed is estimated to be approximately 1.6 m/s when the buoyancy force is comparable to the wind force. When the wind speed is higher than 1.6 m/s, the wind becomes dominant. Otherwise, buoyancy is the dominant force. Notably, the dominant force driving airflow through windows into buildings also varied with window configurations and spatial positions.

As shown in Fig. 6 , the airflow can be divided into a downward circulation region (A), a stagnation region (B), an upward separation region (C), and a recirculation region (D) consisting of a large vortex [49, 50] . The flow separation and vortex development demonstrate the complex nature of the flow around a building. As the dominant driving forces change, the airflow patterns become more complex. Moreover, with windows located in different regions relative to the airflow, the ventilation can vary significantly from one configuration to the next.

            "text": "The air change rate per hour is used to quantify the ventilation rate, which is defined as the ratio of the volume flow rate through a room to the volume of the room in a 1-h period. The volume flow rate was calculated by integrating the velocity perpendicular to the window opening based on the steady airflow field provided by the RANS-based model [18, 51, 52] . The air velocity near the opening should be carefully examined to eliminate false contributions by short-circuiting flows or turbulence-induced ventilation. Notably, the method for determining the ACH used herein is reasonably valid for steady airflow conditions. The impacts of time-dependent dynamics caused by the fluctuating ambient wind on heat and mass transfer were not considered. In addition, it has been reported by Mu et al. [23] that the ACH calculations were slightly higher than the tracer gas decay method, while the results approximated those predicted by empirical models [23] . Nevertheless, the calculation of ACH based on the steady flow field from the RANS-based model was still widely used, in view of the desirable computing efficiency and detailed information that can be provided [18, 23, 52] . Fig. 7 presents the relationship of the ACH and wind speed for windward (left column) and leeward (right column) conditions for each floor. In the windward conditions, the wind could either assist or oppose the buoyancy force to ventilate the building, depending on the wind speed. The buoyancy force was dominant when the wind speed was low, whereas the wind force became dominant as the wind speed increased. When the dominant force switched from buoyancy to wind, the ACH first decreased and then increased with increasing wind speed. After that, the wind dominated the building ventilation, and the ACH generally increased with increasing wind speed in the windward conditions (and was more substantial than that in the leeward conditions). ACH was the largest for the first floor, moderate on the second floor, and increased slightly on the third floor. This was due to the airflow patterns in front of the building, and the higher ACH on the third floor was also Fig. 7 also shows a comparison of the window types, and indicates that the airflows driven by the combined force for different window types were not equal, even though the areas of the openings for each window type were identical. The HPW, VPW and TILT types performed noticeably better than the other three window types (Fig. 7(a) , (c), and (e)). The HPW, VPW, and TILT types create openings that effectively direct ambient wind into a building. In contrast, the other three window types impede the wind from entering the building, whereby the window panes block the airflow path. In leeward conditions, changes in the ACH with wind speed and building floor were less prominent than in the windward conditions. By comparing the ventilation rates for each window, the TILT type was found to provide better ventilation performance across all flow conditions, whereas the other window types were similar to each other ( Fig. 7(b), (d) , and (f)). Overall, greater ventilation was achieved as more air entered the buildings. Notably, the ventilation performance of the HPW type varied significantly with the floor level. Fig. 8 (a b), (c d) , and (e f) are different, as the pollutant concentrations were significantly different for each floor. In the windward conditions, the average concentration reached approximately ~100 ppb on the first floor (where the pollutant source was located), and less than ~1 ppb on the second and third floors. The average concentrations fluctuated with increasing wind speeds because the buoyancy and wind forces counteracted one another. The wind suppressed the airflow, and the buoyancy induced the airflow; once the forces matched intensity, minimal air was allowed through the windows, and the pollutants remained indoors. The pollutant concentration fluctuation was more evident on the first floor. Further discussion on the counteracting phenomenon of the buoyancy force and wind force was provided in our previous work [30] .",

The average concentrations in the leeward conditions were higher than those in the windward conditions. The concentrations reached approximately ~10 ppb and ~1 ppb on the second and third floors, respectively. A monotonic decrease in the average concentrations appeared when the wind speed increased. In conditions with low wind speed, the AW and VSW types demonstrated the best and worst performances, respectively, in preventing pollutants from entering the upper floors. With increasing wind speed, the HPW and TURN types gradually performed better, whereas the TILT and VPW types were not as effective, as shown in Fig. 8(d) and (f). Fig. 9 presents the contours of the pollutant concentration at the central x-plane of the building with the various window types at a wind speed of 1 m/s. The AW type effectively restricted the pollutant within the room where the source was located, as shown in Fig. 9 (e) and (f). In contrast, the TILT type had the adverse effect of directing the pollutant into the upper floor windows, as these window panes do not redirect the flow, as shown in Fig. 9(c) and (d) . The VSW and TURN types generated similar paths for pollutant transmission between floors, although the window configurations were very different from each other, as shown in Fig. 9 (a), (b), (g), and (h). The airflow paths for the HPW and VPW types were almost identical to those of the TILT and TURN types, respectively; hence, the HPW and VPW cases are not shown in Fig. 9 . Regarding the pollutant concentration for each window type, a pollutant cloud was visible near each window, which exacerbates the infection risks to adjacent buildings owing to cross-transmission. Fig. 10 presents the relationship of the average concentration and source location in both windward and leeward conditions for each window type at 1 m/s. The location of the pollutant source in a multistory building is another critical factor affecting cross-transmission. When the source was situated in the first floor room, the pollutant transmission to the upper floors was more significant for each window configuration in leeward conditions. When the source was in the second floor room, more pollutant was transported to the lower floor in windward conditions. In contrast, the pollutant transmission to the upper floor became more substantial in leeward conditions for all window types except the AW. When the source was located in the third floor room, the pollutant concentration on the first floor was minimal, as the first floor was far from the source. Overall, the VSW and AW types were the most effective in reducing pollutant transmission. The airflow driven by the buoyancy force transported the pollutant to the upper floors, Fig. 11 .

Fig. 12 shows the infection risk versus wind speed for each floor when the virus is released by an infector on the first floor. In the windward conditions, the infection risk decreased with increases in wind speed and floor level, except with the VSW and TURN types at 2 m/ s; this effect was caused by the suppression of buoyancy and wind. The risk of infection when using the VSW and TURN types on the first floor was greater than 50%. With increasing wind speeds, the AW and TILT windows had the highest infection risk, as shown in Fig. 12(a) , (c), and (e). In the leeward conditions, the infection risk was smaller on the virus-released floor, but was larger on the non-released floors. Among the six window types, the VSW type created the highest infection risk because of cross-transmission, as shown in Fig. 12(d) and (f). Additionally, the highest infection risk owing to cross-transmission was less than 3% in the windward and leeward conditions for the floors above the source of the virus. If the flow conditions, such as the driving force, window type, and source location, are changed, the infection risk from cross-transmission during the outbreak of a pandemic virus may become The Archimedes number (Ar) was used to further analyze the infection risk in cross-transmission by identifying if the dominant force was buoyancy or wind.

The selected wind speeds are related to Ar; hence, three cases are shown: Ar \u00bc 2.5 (buoyancy-dominant), Ar \u00bc 1.0 (buoyancy and wind), and Ar \u00bc 0.1 (wind-dominant). When the infector released the virus on the first floor, the infection risk in the leeward conditions was higher when the buoyancy force was dominant, as shown in Fig. 13 (a) and (b). With increasing wind speeds, the infection risk in the windward conditions was higher with comparable buoyancy and wind, as shown in Fig. 13 (c) and (d). With higher wind speeds, there were no obvious differences in the infection risks for the windward and leeward conditions. Moreover, the infection risk was significantly reduced once the wind became dominant, as shown in Fig. 13 (e) and (f). If the infector released the virus on the second floor, the infection risks on the first floor in the windward conditions and on the third floor in the leeward conditions were higher, as shown in Fig. 13(a)-(d) . Once the wind exceeded the buoyancy, the infection risks on the first and third floors in the leeward conditions were higher, as shown in Fig. 13 (e) and (f). When the infector released the virus on the third floor, the variances in infection risks versus wind directions were opposite to those in the first floor scenario, as shown in Fig. 13 (a)-(d). If the wind speed was large enough, the infection risk became higher in the leeward conditions, as shown in Fig. 13 (e) and (f). Furthermore, the infection risk when the virus was released on the second or third floor was reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the infection risk on the virus-released floor. Therefore, an infector releasing a virus on the central floor of a building may pose a more severe threat, owing to the cross-transmission by upper and lower airflows between floors. Furthermore, the performances of the various windows in controlling the infection risks were inconsistent. Overall, the VSW type led to the highest infection risk when the virus was released on lower floors, whereas the AW type led to the highest infection risk when the virus was released on the upper floors. Moreover, the infection risks with the various window types on floors further from the virus release location were reduced when the ambient wind was sufficiently strong. Therefore, it was essential to combine the driving force and source location to evaluate the performances of the various windows in reducing the infection risk.",
