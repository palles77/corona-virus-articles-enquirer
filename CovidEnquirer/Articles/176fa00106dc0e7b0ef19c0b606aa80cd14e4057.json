Only a subset of individuals-up to 10% of Asians, 50% of Europeans, and 90% of Africans-carry the DG allele of a genetic variant rs368234815-TT/DG and are genetically able to produce IFN-l4 protein. Carriers of the DG allele have impaired ability to clear infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). IFN-l4 is also predicted to exist and be functionally important in several nonhuman mammals. In this study, we present the first comparative analysis of 12 mammalian IFN-l4 orthologs in a human hepatic cell line, HepG2, which supports signaling of the human IFN-l4. We show that despite differences in protein sequences, functional properties of the recombinant human and nonhuman IFN-l4 proteins are comparable-they are all expressed as predominantly cytoplasmic proteins that are biologically active for induction of interferon signaling. We show that several IFN-l4 orthologs can be detected by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal imaging using a monoclonal antibody developed for the human IFN-l4. Studies of IFN-l4 in animals should help improve our understanding of the biology of this novel clinically important interferon in normal and disease conditions.",

Type-I IFNs include a panel of IFN-a subtypes, IFN-b, IFN-e, IFN-k, and IFN-o, all of which signal through a ubiquitous IFNAR receptor complex, consisting of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 receptors. IFN-g, the only known type-II IFN, signals through its own receptor complex, IFNGR, consisting of the IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 receptors. Type-III IFNs (IFN-l1-4) signal through the IFNLR receptor complex, which consists of the IFNLR1 receptor specific to type-III IFNs, and the IL10R2 receptor shared by all type-III IFNs and the IL-10 family of cytokines. The signaling of type-III IFNs is restricted compared with other IFNs because expression of IFNLR1 is largely limited to epithelial cells, such as of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. IFN activity in these cells, which are commonly exposed to exogenous pathogens, is important for prevention of viral entry and dissemination.",

The human-specific TT allele, which eliminates IFN-l4 protein by a frameshift in the first exon, appeared only 60,000 years ago (Key and others 2014) . Apparently, this event was beneficial because it was favored by positive selection, which has resulted in a rapid increase of the TT allele frequency (or a rapid loss of the DG allele) in human populations (Key and others 2014) .",

Chronic HCV infection eventually increases the risk of death due to liver failure and liver cancer, but this process takes decades, thus improvement of HCV clearance due to genetic inability to produce IFN-l4 could not be the reason for the positive selection observed for the rs368234815-TT allele (Key and others 2014) . The strength of this selection indicates that IFN-l4 might have interfered with clearance of other more deadly pathogens, suggesting that elucidation of IFN-l4 function could be important for understanding, prevention, and treatment of some existing and emerging infections.",

The three other type-III IFNs (IFN-l1, IFN-l2, and IFN-l3), which share high protein identity (81% between IFN-l1 and IFN-l2 and 96% between IFN-l2 and IFN-l3), were discovered in 2003 (Kotenko and others 2003; Sheppard and others 2003) . All four type-III IFNs are encoded by a 55 Kb genomic cluster on the human chromosome19q13.2. Due to low sequence similarity between IFNL4 and the genes for other type-III IFNs, IFNL4 could not be identified by a homology search. The reference human genome sequence has the rs368234815-TT allele, which does not support the IFN-l4 ORF, thus the existence of IFN-l4 was not predicted. IFN-l4 was identified by direct cloning and annotation of sequences discovered through RNA sequencing of human hepatocytes treated with PolyI:C to mimic viral infection (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013).",

Interestingly, the lowest leader peptide prediction score was for human IFN-l4 (0.56), followed by marmoset (0.67); all other orthologs had higher prediction scores (0.77-0.87) (Table 1) . However, a swap of leader peptides between the poorly secreted IFN-l4 and highly secreted IFN-l3 did not affect the secretion of IFN-l4 (Hamming and others 2013), suggesting that the predicted strength of the leader peptide might not be relevant for IFN-l4 secretion. The most diverse area in IFN-l4 is the sequence immediately after the predicted leader peptide-the 7 amino acid fragment was missing in all primates and this sequence was different in all nonprimates (Fig. 1) . This fragment did not seem to affect the leader peptide prediction scores and its functional significance is unclear.",

            "text": "Despite being only poorly secreted, human IFN-l4 can efficiently activate IFN signaling (Prokunina-Olsson and others 2013; Onabajo and others 2015). We evaluated biological activity of the IFN-l4 orthologs after transient expression in HepG2 cells stably expressing an interferonstimulated response element (ISRE) coupled with luciferase reporter (ISRE-Luc); this system was previously used to characterize human IFN-l4. We observed differential biological activity of the IFN-l4 orthologs: compared with human IFN-l4, proteins from chimpanzee, orangutan, marmoset, and cynomolgus showed similar levels of biological activity (ISRE-Luc activation), while the dog protein showed significantly higher activity (by 40%). Orthologs from rhesus, panda, and elephant were significantly less active (25% compared with the human IFN-l4, Fig. 2 ). Biological activities of the IFN-l4 orthologs measured in this experiment are likely to be affected by differential affinity of these proteins to human receptors and do not represent quantitative comparisons. However, the fact that all of the IFN-l4 orthologs were able to activate ISRE-Luc reporter above the background level (control-Halo) indicates that these proteins are biologically active as IFNs, even in human cells. Because all of the IFN-l4 orthologs are predicted to have leader peptides and showed biological activity for induction of IFN signaling, which is typical for exogenously acting IFNs, it is likely that at least a portion of these proteins is secreted. At the same time, if these orthologs behave like the human IFN-l4, they will also be retained in the cytoplasm. To test this, we evaluated protein expression and cellular localization of all orthologs transiently expressed in HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis of protein lysates (Fig. 3) , flow cytometry analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), and confocal imaging ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) confirmed that all IFN-l4 orthologs are detectable by an antibody or a fluorescent ligand for the Halo-tag, which is present on all these proteins.",

The results were similar for orthologs that were detectable both by Halo-tag and MAB-IFN-l4. The rabbit monoclonal antibody (RAB-IFN-l4) recognized only the human IFN-l4. This is likely because the area that can be recognized by MAB-IFN-l4 is more conserved between species compared with the area that can be recognized by the RAB-IFN-l4 (Fig. 1) . Further genomic studies may help to identify IFN-l4 orthologs in other relevant species. The success and accuracy of these predictions rely on the quality and completion of available genomic sequencing and additional targeted DNA sequencing is often needed to validate the existing sequences and close the gaps. Detailed analysis of functional properties of IFN-l4 orthologs in relation to differences in protein sequences could provide additional information on its biology.",

However, it remains largely unknown what factors induce endogenous IFN-l4 expression in different conditions and why elimination of IFN-l4 was a beneficial event in humans strongly supported by positive selection. Answers to these questions might be relevant for dealing with existing and emerging infections across species. Viral infections have been directly responsible for some of the most dramatic and deadly disease pandemics in human history and many of these infections, including the recent Ebola outbreak, are of zoonotic origin ( Jones and others 2008). There are also indirect devastating effects of these infections through the loss of livestock and wildlife, causing food shortages and financial distress (Frolich and others 2002; Thumbi and others 2015) . Some animals and corresponding derived cell lines are used for studies of human infections and vaccine development (Meurens and others 2012; Gerdts and others 2015) .
