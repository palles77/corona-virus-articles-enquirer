            "text": "BACKGROUND: Influenza is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory tract infection. The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness, which might be fatal, particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions,immunocompromised people, the elderly, and pregnant women. I nfluenza is an acute, highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory tract that infects both humans and animals. [1] [2] [3] [4] Human influenza viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family, consisting of the genera influenza A, B, and C viruses. A new strain of influenza A(H1N1) virus known as influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 emerged in 2009 causing a global influenza pandemic (official nomenclature from Pandemic Disease Mexico 2009). [5] [6] [7] This strain now cocirculates with other seasonal viruses. 7 Only influenza A and B viruses cause epidemics in humans. [8] [9] [10] Influenza viruses circulate, causing disease in humans every year. In temperate climates, the disease tends to occur seasonally in the winter months. 11 Influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols, large droplets, or direct contact with secretions (or fomites). Seasonal influenza viruses can cause a wide range of symptoms from mild to severe illness, which can lead to death, particularly in persons at increased risk for severe disease, including pregnant women, the very young and very old, immunocompromised people, and people with chronic underlying medical conditions. 12 Seasonal influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can be infected multiple times throughout their lives. 13 Therefore, the components of seasonal influenza vaccines are reviewed frequently (currently biannually) and updated periodically to ensure the continued effectiveness of the vaccines. 14 A pandemic occurs when an influenza virus, which is not previously known to be circulating among humans and to which most people do not have immunity, emerges and transmits among humans. These viruses may emerge, circulate, and cause large outbreaks outside of the normal influenza season. 15, 16 The World Health Organization (WHO) was called in 2005 to strengthen the surveillance system of all events of international public health concern. 17 The strengthening of the influenza surveillance system was set as a goal by WHO and concerned bodies in 2009, following the emergence of the novel strain of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09.",

Public health measures, as recommended by the WHO pandemic guidelines at that time, incorporated thermal screening at the points of entry, tracing and screening all contacts, follow-up of direct contacts, and strict infection control measures.

The Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) and Communicable Disease Control Department collaborated to design web-based data analysis software to address public health needs during the 2009 pandemic. The software compiles, analyzes, and generates weekly and cumulative national reports. All suspected cases requiring hospitalization were tested according to the WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza within three days of the onset of clinical symptoms. 9 The procedure for the sample collection and laboratory diagnosis are detailed on the web page for laboratory services of the province of British Columbia, Canada. 18",

This finding is likely due to the outbreak of influenza during and after Hajj 2015, especially in the areas of Makkah and Jeddah, and a policy of testing all suspected cases of MERS CoV to Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 issued in the second half of the year 2014.

The population density and crowdedness in these two regions may have predisposed to some A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreaks during winter seasons of 2015.

Given that the policy was to limit laboratory testing for A(H1N1)pdm09 to admitted cases only, the reported confirmed cases do not reflect the actual overall disease burden. The CFR based on the suspected cases as the denominator [0.54% (CI: 0.50-0.58)] should be interpreted with caution. As well, CFR based on the confirmed cases as the denominator [3.56% (95%CI: 3.29-3.85)] represents the fatality among the severely morbid cases only. In line with international studies. 21,22 the highest CFR was reported among the age group 60 years and above in all years, with 17.1% in 2011 and 15% in 2013, and this fits into the international data where influenza and pneumonia were the seventh cause of death in this age group. The next highest affected was the age group 30-59 years with 10.5% in 2013 and 9.5% in 2011. The overall fatality rates showed a decline over time with an age shifting towards elders.",

SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the realtime PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year. Riyadh, Jeddah and the Eastern areas (regions with the highest population) reported most of the cases. LIMITATION: Only one strain of H1N1 was tested. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None.",
