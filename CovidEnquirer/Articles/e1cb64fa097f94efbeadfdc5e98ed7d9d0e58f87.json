On the other hand, viral infections of the airway are associated with the acute exacerbations of COPD. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the prevalence rate of viral infections in acute exacerbations of COPD patients. Methods: PubMed database was systematically searched for population-based prevalence studies . Fixed and random effects models were used for estimation of summary effect-sizes. Between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were also calculated. \"Viral infections\" and \"COPD patients with exacerbations\" were the two critical inclusion criteria. Results: Twenty-eight studies were selected out of 26078 articles for the present review. The overall estimation of the prevalence of viral infection was 0.374 (95% C.I: 0.359-0.388). Also, the evident heterogeneity of viral infection was observed among the studies (Cochran Q test, p value < 0.001 and I-squared = 97.5%). The highest and lowest prevalence rate was related to rhinovirus and echovirus, respectively. Also, the results of this study showed that the prevalence of viral infection in exacerbated COPD patients has fluctuation during the years with a slight increase and decrease. Conclusions: The results of this systematic review demonstrated that respiratory viral infections have an important role in the acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). In addition, determining the exact geographic epidemiology of these viruses is very important to manage the treatment of these infections.",

About 174.5 million (2.4%) of people worldwide (2015) suffer from COPD [3] . Cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms of COPD [1] . COPD Exacerbation is the most complicated status of COPD diagnosed by a sudden worsening of COPD symptoms, including shortness of breath, quantity, and color of phlegm [4] . As many studies imply, COPD acute exacerbations are a multifactorial consequence mainly caused by respiratory infections [5] . Smoking, air pollution, genetics, and viral infections are most important risk factors for the disease [1, 6] . Almost all people experience airway viral infections during their life in which most cases are improved without developing the chronic respiratory disease [6] . Several studies confirmed the association between airway inflammation and the tissue remodeling and destruction [7] . Airway inflammation has a central role in the pathogenesis of COPD, and on the other hand, persistent infections lead to chronic inflammation [7] . In COPD patients, exacerbations are mainly due to frequent infections. According to the role of viruses for inflammation and involvement of inflammation in COPD pathogenesis, studying the presence of viral infections in the airway of high-risk persons is important. The most human respiratory viruses associated with exacerbations of COPD are divided into two categories [1] : Major viruses: human rhinovirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [2] , Minor viruses: parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [8] . The very important in preventing these problems. For this purpose, different techniques were developed, including serology, molecular methods such as PCR and RT-PCR [2] . Respiratory viruses that cause AECOPD are reported in several studies to help with the management of AECOPD patients. We aimed to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to determine the frequency of viral infection among COPD patients and to evaluate the hypothesis that the viral infection prevalence rate is associated with COPD exacerbation.",

            "text": "This meta-analysis is performed to estimate the geographical distribution of viral infections in COPD patients worldwide. According to the sensitivity analysis, the results of this meta-analysis is robust against any included study. But, the funnel plot indicated non-significant right bias, which assumes in general a symmetry assumption. Previous studies demonstrated that during the exacerbation of COPD, some viruses are frequently detected and the immune system responses to these viruses may be involved in the severity of exacerbations (for example, increased levels of IL-8 due to rhinovirus infection) [8] . Another effective factor is the increased oxidant stress response to viral infections in COPD exacerbation [4] . During exacerbations, levels of IL-6 and plasma fibrinogen increase significantly, suggesting that respiratory viral infections increase systemic inflammation and thus increase the frequency of AECOPD [4] . In most recent studies, PCR based methods have been used extensively for detection, which resulted in the increased sensitivity of viral detection 2 to 3 times more than other methods [2, 39] . In addition, in our meta-analysis study, PCR based methods were the most common detection methods. It has been confirmed in many studies that respiratory viruses are involved in 30% of AECOPD patients [39] . Through more sensitive molecular methods, the role of viruses in the COPD pathogenesis is better understandable [40] . Seemungal In addition, they demonstrated that COPD patients with viral infections had higher inflammatory cytokine levels compared to COPD patients with negative viral infections and healthy controls. They showed the direct association between viral infections and COPD exacerbations [13] . Among all the viruses found in COPD patients, the rhinovirus is the most common virus (58%), maybe due to the fact that this virus is the major cause of common cold and also is widespread in the community [16] . Rohde et al. (Germany, 2003) performed a case-control study on AECOPD patients and detected 56% viral infections in the AECOPD group compared to 19% in controls, suggesting a possible association between respiratory viral infections and COPD exacerbations. Also, they demonstrated a higher rate of viral detection in the sputum sample than nasal lavage [17] . In another study, Hutchinson et al. (Australia, 2007) demonstrated that some viruses such as parainfluenza, influenza, and picornavirus are strongly associated with the development of AECOPD [20] . Previous studies showed that picornavirus was the most common virus associated with AECOPD, followed by influenza and RSV [2] . In our study, the overall prevalence of viral infections in COPD patients was 42.7%, the most detected viruses were rhinovirus, influenza A, and RSV, and the last ones were echovirus, enterovirus, and WU polyoma virus. The difference in the prevalence of viral infections in these patients could have many reasons such as geographical region, sample type, sample size, sample time, sample transport system, and type of the technique). The current study demonstrated that the prevalence of viral infection in COPD patients was slightly increased by the year of publication and then was again decreased. The possible reasons may be increased individual and social health levels, vaccination for some viruses, prophylaxis of patients, etc. Before developing the laboratory molecular detection methods, the role of viral infections in COPD patients was underestimated, but after the development of sensitive and specific molecular methods, it became clear. In the first line of defense in AECOPD patients, they are treated with antibiotics based on two factors, including the severity of the COPD and the severity of exacerbation [42] . It is obvious that overused or unnecessary antibiotic therapies for treatment of viral infections may simultaneously lead to the advent of multidrug resistant bacteria that are not the real causal agent of the current infection. Therefore, applying more sensitive and rapid methods for a definitive diagnosis of the real cause of the disease can help to make a precise and more exact treatment of AECOPD patients with viral infections and avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics. On the other hand, these rapid methods can reduce patients' costs and prevent antibiotic resistance to bacteria. In addition, according to the association between COPD exacerbations and respiratory viral infections, more effective control, prevention, and therapy for these viral infections are needed.",
