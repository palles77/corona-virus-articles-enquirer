Their precursors, 3-fluoro-6-thio-glucopyranosyl nucleosides 5a-e, were obtained by the sequence of deacetylation of 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-b-D-glucopyranosyl nucleosides 2a-e, selective tosylation of the primary OH of 3 and finally treatment with potassium thioacetate. The desired thiolpyridine protected analogs 7a-c,f,g were obtained by the sequence of deacetylation of 5a-c followed by thiopyridinylation and/or condensation of the corresponding heterocyclic bases with the newly synthesized peracetylated 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) sugar precursor 13, which was obtained via a novel synthetic route from glycosyl donor 12. None of the compounds 6 and 7 showed antiviral activity, but the 5-fluorouracil derivative 7c and particularly the uracil derivative 7b were endowed with an interesting and selective cytostatic action against a variety of murine and human tumor cell cultures.",

To determine the conversion activity, a high amount of recombinant enzyme was incubated with 100 lM of dThd or 13b and 13c in TP-buffer (10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 /K 2 HPO 4 and 150 mM NaCl) or UP-buffer (same as TP-buffer, but 300 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM).

Deprotection of nucleosides 2a-e in methanolic ammonia gave the fully unprotected derivatives 3a-c,f,g, while the base protected benzoylated derivatives 3d,e were obtained when 2d,e were treated with NaOH-ethanol-pyridine [10, 11, 14] . Treatment of 3a-e with ptoluenesulphonyl chloride in dry pyridine [35] and direct acetylation of the free hydroxyls at C-2 0 and C-4 0 with acetic anhydride/pyridine afforded the desired acetylated 6-O-tosylated derivatives 4a-e in very good yields. Subsequently, the tosylated derivatives 4a-e, after treatment with potassium thioacetate in hot N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [36] [37] [38] , were converted into the corresponding thioacetates, 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)thymine (5a), 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)uracil (5b), 1-(2,4di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)5-fluorouracil (5c), 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-N 4 -benzoyl cytosine (5d) and 9-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-N 6 -benzoyl adenine (5e), respectively. Deprotection of the b-protected thionucleosides 5a-e by methanolic ammonia and in situ thiopyridinylation in H 2 O, MeOH and 2,2-dipyridyl disulfide (DTDP) at room temperature [22] , led to the desired derivatives 7a-c. These reactions were completed within 20 h and the isolated yields of the 6-S-nucleosidyl S-pyridine disulfides were generally higher than 65%. Attempts to fully unprotect thionucleosides 5a-c resulted to the formation of their corresponding symmetrical disulfides 6a-c, the thiopyridinylation of which also led to the desired 6-S-nucleosidyl S-dipyridine disulfides 7a-c. It is noteworthy that only decomposition products were obtained after deprotection/thiopyridinylation of N 4 -benzoyl cytosine and N 6benzoyl adenine derivatives, 5d and 5e, respectively.",

Our alternative synthetic pathway, in which compound 12 was envisioned as an appropriate glycosyl donour for the preparation of the suitable sugar, is described in Scheme 2. Initially, selective removal of the 5,6-O-isopropylidene group of starting material 1 [34] led to the formation of diol 8 [33] . Selective sulfonylation of 8 with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride in pyridine led to compound 9, which was treated with dihydropyran (DHP) and p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in dry CH 2 Cl 2 in order to give compound 10 in very satisfactory overall yield. Displacement of the tosyl group with the thioacetyl moiety proceeded without difficulties to afford compound 11. Precursor 12 was readily available from glucofuranose 11 through hydrolysis with 90% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature and direct acetylation. Deprotection of the glycosyl donor 12 using methanolic ammonia, direct thiopyridinyla-tion [22] (8 mol excess of DTDP/MeOH/H 2 O) followed by acetylation led to the desired thiopyridine sugar 13. In order to prepare not only the target 6-S-nucleosidyl S-dipyridine disulfides 7f,g, but the previously synthesized 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) nucleosides 7a-c as well, glycosylation reactions with the corresponding purine and pyrimidine bases and the 6-thiopyridine sugar 13 followed by direct deacetylation were employed.",

Compounds 3a-g (Table 1 ) and the acetyl-substituted 5a-e analogs (data not shown) did not show appreciable antiproliferative activity. Likewise, the 6,6-disulfide glucopyranosyl pyrimidine dinucleoside derivatives 6a-c did not show appreciable cytostatic action against the evaluated tumor cell lines (IC 50 : 71 to >500 lM) (Table   1 ). However, their corresponding 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranosyl mononucleosides 7 were endowed with a more pronounced cytostatic activity in cell culture. In particular, the 5-fluorouracil (7c) and especially the uracil (7b) derivative showed considerable cytostatic potency against the murine L1210, and human Molt4/C8, CEM and HeLa cells. Also, 7c and 7b were cytostatic against proliferating human embryonic lung HEL fibroblasts (IC 50 : 36 lM and 9.2 lM, respectively), Crandell feline kidney cells (CRFK) (IC 50 : 6.2 and 39 lM) and canine Madin-Darby kidney cells (MDCK) (IC 50 : 50 lM and 11 lM, respectively). Conversely, the adenine (7g) and cytosine (7f) derivatives showed poor, if any cytostatic activity (192 \u00c0 >500 lM) ( Table 1) . It is somewhat intriguing that among the 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranosyl mononucleotides, only the derivatives containing an uracil/5-fluorouracil base were markedly more cytostatic than those, which bear a thymine, cytosine or adenine base. The fluorouracil derivatives proved equally cytostatic against murine and human cells, as well as against leukemia, mammary carcinoma, cervix carcinoma and lymphoma tumor cells. The molecular basis of the antiproliferative activity of the fluorouracil derivatives is currently unknown. When compounds 7b and 7c were exposed to purified recombinant thymidine phosphorylase (TPase) or uridine phosphorylase type I (UPase), they were not hydrolyzed to the free pyrimidine base under conditions where thymidine (exposed to TPase) and uridine (exposed to UPase) were readily converted to thymine and uracil, respectively (data not shown). These findings indicate that these molecules exert their potency via their intact nucleoside moiety (or anabolite derived thereof), rather than a catabolic metabolite (i.e. free 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranose). Also, it is clear from the inactivity of the 3a-g series of compounds that the 2-S-pyridyl group plays an important role, in concert with the uracil base, to express pronounced cytostatic activity. In fact, Decout has recently reported on 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxyribonucleoside 3 0 -disulfides [22] and found that those derivatives, which contain a rather bulky moiety on the disulfide part of the molecule (i.e. nitrophenyl, butyl, hexyl, actyl) were also most cytostatic than others. This is in agreement with the presence of a rather bulky entity on the disulfide in compounds 7b and 7c as well. The exact molecular mechanism of cytostatic activity is currently subjected to further studies. Mutatis mutandis, compounds 7b and 7c could be viewed as potential lead compounds for further modification in order to redesign and synthesize more potent cytostatic agents.",

None of the new compounds showed antiviral potency at subtoxic concentrations, but compound 7c, and in particular 7b, were endowed with significant cytostatic potency and can be viewed as novel lead compounds for further modifications. It would therefore be interesting to further explore the structure-activity relationships by modifying the base part as well as the sugar portion by incorporating different chemical entities.",
