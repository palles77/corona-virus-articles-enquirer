It includes entry of the virus into the body, multiplication and spread, the development of tissue damage, and the production of an immune response. It encompasses the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms, the eventual resolution of the infection and, in most cases, virus elimination. Understanding viral disease pathogenesis requires knowledge of each of the stages of infection and an awareness of the mechanisms involved. The pattern of pathogenetic events accompanying infection is remarkably consistent and specific for each individual virus. There may be variation from individual to individual in the severity and/or the duration of these events, but a sound knowledge of the typical sequence associated with each infection is crucial in both making an accurate diagnosis and recommending the appropriate treatment.",

It is expressed as a number per volume, for example, 100 LD 50 per ml. One LD 50 generally represents many more than a single virus particle as (1) usually many of the incoming virus particles are non-infective due to defective assembly, genetic errors, or inactivation caused by environmental conditions, etc., and (2) usually many or most interactions between infective particles and cells do not lead to a productive infection at the tissue/organ/individual level. Further, the \"infective titer\" of a virus sample is not an absolute value, but varies according to the assay system used-there are examples where humans may be infected by samples assayed by a particular laboratory method as containing less than one infectious unit-the human being more sensitive than the laboratory assay. Clearly the volume of the inoculum is important. In blood transfusion, a 500 ml unit of blood may contain an infecting dose even if the virus concentration is low (and transfusion recipients are often also debilitated by a major illness or injury); hence, highly sensitive PCR-based testing of every unit of donated blood is often necessary, as for example, when West Nile virus was first introduced into the United States.",

Additionally, viruses are protected during passage through the stomach of babies by the buffering action of milk. Some enteric viruses not only resist inactivation by proteolytic enzymes in the stomach and intestine, but infectivity may actually be increased by such exposure. The cleavage of a viral outer capsid protein by intestinal proteases enhances the infectivity of rotaviruses and some coronaviruses.",

The emergence of AIDS has drawn attention to the importance of the rectum as a route of viral entry-HIV as well as other sexually transmitted agents may gain entry through damaged rectal mucosae. A layer of mucus, produced by goblet cells, is a formidable barrier to virion attachment. Virions that pass through this layer may multiply in the ciliated cells or pass between them, reaching another physical barrier, the basement membrane.

In the skin, papillomaviruses initiate infection in the basal layer of the epidermis, but maturation of virions occurs only in cells as they move toward the skin surface and become keratinized. Since this is a slow process taking several weeks, papillomas develop slowly. Many poxviruses produce infection via the skin, but in addition to spreading from cell to cell, there is in addition localized sub-epithelial and lymphatic spread.

Conversely, shedding from the basolateral cell surfaces of epithelial cells facilitates invasion of sub-epithelial tissues and subsequent dissemination of virus through lymphatics, blood vessels, or nerves. Paramyxoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza viruses are released preferentially from lumenal (apical) surfaces of respiratory system epithelial cells, whereas HIV 1 and 2 are shed from basolateral surfaces of genital tract and other mucosae into sub-epithelial spaces. The polarized distribution of proteins and lipids at different regions of the cell surface is maintained by the interaction between distinct apical and basolateral sorting signals and the appropriate sorting machineries and transport carriers. Interaction between precursor virus particles and these processes facilitates the transport of viruses from sites of synthesis/assembly to their respective plasma membrane domains along the cell cytoskeleton, microtubules, and other framework constituents. Tight junctions at cell-to-cell contact points prevent the movement of proteins between the two domains and maintain the unique protein composition of each domain. In influenza and respiratory syncytial virus-infected epithelial cells, the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) is carried to a plasma membrane domain where at the same time viral surface glycoproteins are inserted into lipid rafts in the plasma membrane at the nascent budding site. Specific signaling sequences in the stem of the viral glycoprotein spikes are involved along with M-protein determinants. Much of the specificity in the pattern of spread of viruses through the host is due to such evolutionary processes.",

As they enter the marginal sinuses of lymph nodes, virus particles are exposed to active macrophages and dendritic cells and may be engulfed, inactivated, and/or processed for viral antigen presentation to adjacent lymphocytes, thereby initiating the adaptive immune response (see Chapter 6: Adaptive Immune Responses to Infection). Some viruses, however, also replicate in monocytes/macrophages (e.g., many retroviruses, measles virus, dengue viruses, some adenoviruses, and some herpesviruses); some viruses are able to replicate in lymphocytes. Some viruses pass directly through lymph nodes to enter the bloodstream. Monocytes and lymphocytes recirculate through the blood, lymphatics, polarized epithelium, some viruses bud preferentially from the apical surface toward the lumen, while others bud from the baso-lateral surface toward the underlying tissues 2. Virus may be unable to cross the basement membrane unless it is damaged 3. Cell types in more distant parts of the body may lack receptors, or not be permissive for other reasons 4. There may be systemic presence of neutralizing antibody 5. The particular virus strain may be temperature-sensitive, i.e., it may grow successfully in the nasal passages at 33\u00ba but not deeper in the body at 37\u00ba 6. A fusion protein on the virion may require proteolytic cleavage for its activation; proteases capable of performing this cleavage may be restricted to a particular site, e.g., gastrointestinal or respiratory tract and lymph nodes; recirculation is the key to normal \"immune surveillance,\" but is also an effective means of disseminating some viruses throughout the body. Normally, there is a local inflammatory response at the site of viral invasion, the extent of which depends upon the extent of tissue damage. Local blood vessels become dilated and rendered more permeable, so that monocytes and lymphocytes, cytokines, immunoglobulins, and complement components may be delivered directly into the extravascular site of infection. These events are especially vigorous once the adaptive immune response reaches its full level of activity. In some cases, viruses take advantage of these events to infect cells of the lymphoreticular system and spread locally or systemically.",

The retarded growth and developmental abnormalities may be due, in addition to ischemic effects, to slowing of cell division leading to the reduced numbers of cells in many fetal organs.

Therefore, long-term persistence of a potentially cytocidal virus can occur only if the viral genome remains fully or partially silent, or if a dynamic can be established whereby newly made viruses can continue to find new uninfected cells. In latent herpesvirus infections, only a few early genes are transcribed during latency. Latency is eventually overridden, often following immunosuppression and/or by the action of a cytokine or hormone that de-represses transcription of the whole viral genome, leading to reactivation of viral synthesis. In contrast, persistent HIV infection is characterized by continuing virus production in T lymphocytes leading to cell death. This is combined with massive parallel proliferation of uninfected lymphocytes which become a target for further rounds of HIV replication and damage. Restricted viral genome expression as seen in several persistent infections naturally limits the presentation of viral antigens to the immune system, allowing such infected cells to remain immunologically invisible. For example, in herpes simplex virus infection latently infected neurons display no viral antigens. This protects these cells not only against cytotoxic T cells but also against lysis by antibodies or complement-mediated mechanisms or possibly by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).",

It has been known since the work of von Pirquet in 1908 that measles infection depresses skin responses to tuberculin and can reactivate latent tuberculosis. Other immunological abnormalities found during the acute phase of measles include spontaneous proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes and increased plasma interferon-\u03b3. The depressed delayedtype hypersensitivity response, decreased NK cell activity, increased plasma IgE level, and increased soluble IL-2 receptor can persist for up to four weeks after the onset of the rash. These and other immunological abnormalities probably account for the susceptibility to secondary infections that cause most of the mortality during outbreaks of measles.",

Allied with the failure to recover virus from the brain of fatal cases, this has led to the view that post-infectious encephalitis is probably an autoimmune disease. Myelin basic protein (MBP) can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid, and, at least in the case of measles, anti-MBP antibodies and T cells can be detected in the blood. Theoretically, autoimmune damage can continue long after the virus that triggered the response has been cleared from the body. Once the cross-reactive viral amino acid sequence has induced a humoral and/or cellular immune response that brings about damage to normal tissue, proteins that are normally sequestered may be exposed to the immune system. If the cellular protein is capable of immune recognition by the host, there may be a chain reaction of progressive damage.

At one end of the spectrum, use of better diagnostics, particularly rapid PCR-based tests for respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses, has revealed that multiple infections are not at all unusual, nor unfortunately is the nosocomial acquisition within hospital of further virus infections by a child after being admitted to hospital for one initial infection. This can create ambiguity in ascribing a patient's clinical disease to any one particular virus detected by the diagnostic laboratory, and necessitates careful case-control studies of populations at risk with and without disease before a newly discovered virus can be definitively implicated as a new pathogen.",

Management of these patients poses additional challenges. In patients with HBV or HCV infection, the additional presence of HIV infection produces clinical outcomes that might be expected from a diminished immune response: with HBV, higher levels of virus replication and milder inflammatory liver disease, and with HCV a lower rate of clearance of the HCV infection. However, in both situations liver disease frequently progresses more rapidly through fibrosis to cirrhosis and brings a worsening prognosis. Conversely, the additional presence of HBV or HCV does not appear to significantly influence the course of HIV infection. Selection of optimal antiviral drug regimens requires consideration of the patient's history of prior treatment, resistance patterns of the patient's virus, and the multiple effects of some drugs against more than one virus. Successful treatment of HIV infection with anti-retroviral drugs carries the risk of \"immune restoration disease,\" which may involve recruitment of both antigenspecific and non-antigen-specific mononuclear cells to the liver, possibly mediated by interferon-\u03b3. With both HBV and HCV, this can lead to flares of inflammatory liver disease, which can progress to hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis.",

This is an important principle in understanding the emergence of zoonotic infections in humans (Chapter 15: Emerging Virus Diseases). Furthermore, there are well-studied examples where a virus may be virulent when introduced by one route, for example, intracerebral inoculation, but harmless when given by another route, for example, intraperitoneally.",

Other endpoints that can be used are the time to death or the time to the appearance of clinical signs, weight loss, or fever (to accord with modern standards for humane care of experimental animals). Assessment of the virulence of a virus in humans cannot be made in such a controlled experimental way, but often becomes evident when observing outbreaks of acute infection. Interpretation is more complicated in chronic infections-for example, the appearance of a new strain, or a higher viral load, of HIV in a patient whose clinical condition is worsening, may indicate that a new strain or higher virus replication is causative of the increasing disease, or it may be a result of increasing immunosuppression.",
