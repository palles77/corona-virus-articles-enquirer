The large quantity of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) found in tissue samples is thought to be a major factor contributing to the comparatively lower sensitivity of detecting RNA viruses, as a sequence-independent PCR is used to amplify unknown samples for microarray analysis. This study aimed to determine whether depletion or exclusion of rRNA can improve microarray detection and simplify its analysis. Therefore, two different rRNA depletion and exclusion protocols, RiboMinus TM technology and non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides, were applied to the microarray sample processing and the outcome was compared with those of the sequence-independent amplification protocol. This study concludes that the two procedures, described to deplete or exclude rRNA, have negligible effect on the microarrays detection and analysis and might only in combination with further techniques result in a significant enhancement of sensitivity. Currently, existing protocols of random amplification and background adjustment are pertinent for the purpose of sample processing for microarray analysis.",

Virus identification is less challenging when probing known viral diseases, in particular, those with characteristic clinical signs.

Most detection assays are dependent on the availability of antibodies, antigens or sequence information which are often lacking when investigating novel or divergent pathogens.",

In this regard, RNA viruses are of particular concern, as they mutate at a higher rate than DNA viruses and lack proofreading enzymes to prevent errors during RNA replication (Holland et al., 1982) . The constant threat of new infectious diseases reiterates the need for rapid and multiplex detection assays such as microarrays, which can probe thousands of viruses simultaneously. In addition, these assays have the potential to detect viruses closely related to known viral pathogens and viral co-infections. Microarrays, however, do not come without challenges.",

The necessary use of sequence independent amplification to process tissues from unknown viral diseases results in co-amplification of host along with viral nucleic acids. This non-specific amplification is also thought to complicate the interpretation of readout values due to cross hybridization. The rRNA may also compete with viral RNA amplification and instigate lower detection sensitivity. Ribosomal RNA depletion methods, such as RiboMinus TM technology (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), were stated to improve microarray analysis (Gilbert et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011) . In the RiboMinus TM protocol, rRNA molecules are depleted from total RNA using biotin labelled oligonucleotide probes, which hybridize to 18S, 28S, 5.8S and 5S rRNA before being removed with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The procedure has been found to reduce large rRNA by 80% (Gilbert et al., 2010) . Endoh and colleagues (2005) have used a mix of 96 non-rRNA binding hexamers, screened from 4096 hexamers, to exclude rRNA molecules from amplification. The procedure was claimed to decrease the amount of non-specific amplification and enhance the sensitivity of a virus discovery assay. The 96 hexamers were also shown to reduce rRNA amplification by >90% and to improve sensitivity of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) (De Vries et al., 2011) . The hexamers also increased microarray specificity and simplified its analytical process (Kang et al., 2011) . These studies, however, only looked at viruses isolated in cell culture and nasal swabs.",

The BLAST program from the SANGER Institute was used to find the hits between the hexamers and the sequences. The ensuing 50 hexamers were then mapped to genome sequences of several viruses of human and animal importance (Table 2 ). This was to assess the number of binding sites of the 50 hexamers on the viral genomes and also to measure the nucleotide distance between the binding sites. Among the viruses used, Louping Ill virus (LIV) genome had the lowest binding sites and also the largest distance between the binding sites, prompting us to include this virus in the study to evaluate the efficiency of the 50 hexamers in generating cDNA. Furthermore, in order to assess whether the 50 hexamers performance could be influenced by low viral load, serial 10-fold dilutions of a Classical Swine Fever virus (CSFV) positive nucleic acid were made in nucleic acid derived from a virus negative tissue. The nucleic acid dilutions were then subjected to cDNA synthesis using the 50 hexamers or random priming followed by CSFV qPCR to quantify the virus-specific amplicons. The Ct values, obtained by the qPCR for each of the CSFV nucleic acid dilutions using either of the two protocols, were comparable with only minor differences. The average CSFV Ct values for random priming were 25.3, 24.2, 27.9, 31.2 compared to 26.6, 24.1, 27.1 and 30.8 for the 50 hexamers using neat, 10 \u22121 , 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22123 CSFV dilutions, respectively.",

Many groups have also attempted to improve sample preparation (Han et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2011; Nicholson et al., 2011) whilst others worked on depleting rRNA from extracted nucleic acid for the same purpose (Endoh et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011) .

However, only a small decrease in 18S rRNA load could be achieved by the hexamers with no repercussion on microarray detection. On the contrary, De Vries et al. (2011) found non-rRNA binding hexamers reduced 28S rRNA amplification by up to 100 fold depending on the region of the rRNA genome used for quantification. The work, however, was carried out using only nasopharyngeal swabs which have trivial amounts of cell contamination in comparison to tissue samples. Furthermore, as a commercial primers-probe mix was used in the study, it was not possible to verify which region of 28S or 18S rRNA genome was targeted by the PCR for comparison.",

However, no difference in microarray detection was observed compared to the random priming protocol, especially when applied to deplete rRNA from samples with a low viral load. This may be due to the length of nucleic acid handling time and several steps of separations and washes in the RiboMinus TM protocol, causing degradation and poor recovery of viral nucleic acid. Therefore, the protocol may have removed rRNA effectively, but in the meantime affected adversely viral nucleic acid integrity. In addition, RiboMinus TM Technology is comparatively expensive and time consuming, which restricts its application where a high throughput testing is sought. For these reasons, it would be unrealistic to justify implementing RiboMinus TM Technology, unless it was highly effective at improving a test, which we cannot confirm for microarray. However, RiboMinus TM or similar technologies may prove to be beneficial in enrichment of pathogen specific sequences from NGS libraries prepared from complex matrices, e.g. tissues samples.",

(2011) found that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides had improved the microarrays specificity. However, all the samples used in the evaluation were virus isolates, which often contain a small amount of cellular contamination and therefore cannot represent tissue samples used for microarray analysis in its intended clinical application. In addition, host genomes were only removed prior to nucleic acid extraction for the experiment carried out with non-rRNA oligonucleotides, which may account for the improvement. The script used to run the DetectiV software may also have been a major contributing factor for equal performance of the three protocols seen in this study, especially when analysing cross hybridization. The software employs a script with instructions to subtract florescence data of an unrelated sample from those of an in-test sample. This background adjustment has already minimised the effect of cross hybridization signals and may have contributed to the comparable outcome for the three protocols. The importance of using signal averages in addition to p-values in microarray analysis was also identified, as the detection rate was found to be lower when using the p-value only. This is due to variability in the signal intensity among individual probes and probe numbers representing a virus. The original work describing the DetectiV software (Watson et al., 2007) has relied only on the p values to analyse microarray outputs. Finally, tissue samples from experimental conditions, which harbour a higher load of rRNA, compared to cell culture isolates, may have rendered a lower efficiency for the rRNA exclusion of the 50 hexamers. The short length of hexamers and consequently nonspecific binding may also contribute to the findings of this study, therefore longer oligonucleotides, e.g. nonamers may be more applicable.",
