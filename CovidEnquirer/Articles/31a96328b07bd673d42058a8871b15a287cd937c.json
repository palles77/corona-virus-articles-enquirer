Although many rotaviruses are present in the stools of pigs infected with rotavirus, there is no simple method for the detection of the virus. Although electron microscopy (Bishop, 1974) and the tissue culture method (Fukusho et al., 1981 ) can detect rotavirus, these methods are very complicated and need a lot of equipment. In the case of human rotavirus, many methods have been developed for the direct detection of the virus in stools by immunoassay, such as enzyme immunoassay (Sarrkinenn, 1981) , radioimmunoassay (Kalika et al., 1977) , reverse passive hemagglutination (RPHA) (Sanekata et al., 1979) and latex agglutination (LA; Sanekata et al., 1981 ) . In this paper, we report the development of a new LA test for the rapid diagnosis of porcine rotavirus infections. (Theil, 1977) , Wa, NCDV, and SAll strains were used to represent porcine, human, call, and simian rotaviruses respectively. Thesc viruses were prepared in MA-104 cells and purified as described previously (Sanekata, 1981 ) . This procedure involved rate zonal centrifugation using sucrose and metrizamidc. The resulting virus-containing bands were further purified b~ flotation in a metrizamide gradient at an ultracentritugation speed of 36 000 rpm t'or 16 ta. The high purity of the virus fraction was confirmed b\\ electron microscopy.",

However, these methods seem to be inappropriate t`or routine diagnosis. Electron microscopy is complicated and needs expert technicians. Radioimmunoassay requires radioisotopes. The tissue culture method employing MA-104 cells takes a considerable time to perform. Enzyme immunoassay is not economical t'or testing a small number of samples. The agglutination method is thought to be useful, however, since it is rapid, simple and sensitive enough to be employed as a routine test (Sanekata et al., 1979 (Sanekata et al., , 198 I. 1990 ). In this study, we developed the LA test for the detection of porcine rotavirus directly from stools, and compared the sensitivity of the LA test with that of the electron microscope test.",

Hence we consider that these antibodies are not suitable l'or the detection of porcine rotavirus. A kit for the detection of human rotavirus using anti-NCDV antibody could in fact detect only 12 of 17 rotavirus-positive samples, while LA-antiOSU could detect all of these porcine rotaviruses.",
