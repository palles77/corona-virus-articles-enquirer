            "text": "This Perspectives in Veterinary Medicine article seeks to define, describe putative causes, and discuss key diagnostic tests for primary and secondary bronchiolar disorders to propose a classification scheme in cats with support from a literature review and case examples. The small airways (bronchioles with inner diameters <2 mm), located at the transitional zone between larger conducting airways and the pulmonary acinus, have been overlooked as major contributors to clinical syndromes of respiratory disease in cats. Because the trigger for many bronchiolar disorders is environmental and humans live in a shared environment with similar susceptibility, understanding these diseases in pet cats has relevance to One Health. Thoracic radiography, the major imaging modality used in the diagnostic evaluation of respiratory disease in cats, has low utility in detection of bronchiolar disease. Computed tomography (CT) with paired inspiratory and expiratory scans can detect pathology centered on small airways. In humans, treatment of bronchiolar disorders is not well established because of heterogeneous presentations and often late definitive diagnosis. A review of the human and veterinary medical literature will serve as the basis for a proposed classification scheme in cats. A case series of cats with CT or histopathologic evidence of bronchiolar lesions or both, either as a primary disorder or secondary to extension from large airway disease or interstitial lung disease, will be presented. Future multi-institutional and multidisciplinary discussions among clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists will help refine and develop this classification scheme to promote early and specific recognition and optimize treatment.",

Advances in understanding bronchiolar disorders in humans have been hampered by lack of a widely accepted classification scheme because of different viewpoints of clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists.

In secondary bronchiolar disorders, disease extends to small airways from either the large airways or pulmonary parenchyma (eg, interstitial lung diseases [ILDs] ). 10 Bronchiolar disorders, although recognized in humans, have not yet been described as distinct clinical entities in veterinary medicine.",

[20] [21] [22] [23] Although a description of each is beyond the scope of this article, a discussion of environmental bronchiolar disorders in humans appears relevant because cats and humans share their environment and potential exposures. Known or suspected exposures causing bronchiolar disorders in humans have been reviewed 11 and include chemicals (eg, cleaning compounds, pesticides, artificial flavorings), inhalant particulates, animal or mineral dusts, and gas and smoke inhalation. Previously, environmental bronchiolar disorders were thought to be an acute sequela to a severe, overwhelming exposure, but more recently, disease with an insidious onset of clinical signs without a recognized overexposure event (perhaps representing cumulative smaller exposures) or a mild single exposure has been appreciated. 24 Injury to bronchiolar epithelial cells leads to inflammation and a fibroproliferative repair response, ultimately resulting in mural fibrosis (constrictive bronchiolitis) or intraluminal fibrosis (proliferative bronchiolitis). 25 Four histopathologic types of disease have been proposed: cellular bronchiolitis (inflammatory infiltrate of the bronchioles), constrictive bronchiolitis (concentric fibrosis of the wall leading to narrowed airway caliber), proliferative bronchiolitis (polyps of connective tissue within the bronchiolar lumen), and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (proliferative bronchiolitis with polyps extending into the alveolar ducts and alveoli). 11 BOX 1 The importance of the secondary pulmonary lobule in humans and the lack of an analogous structure in cats Superior imaging detail of computed tomography (CT) allows comparison with histologic features.

Dogs are similar to cats and also lack secondary pulmonary lobules, and the pulmonary acinus has been suggested to be the important highresolution CT (HRCT) unit of the canine lung. 26 The acinus is defined as the region of the lung supplied by a single terminal bronchiole, representing the smallest functional unit of the lung. Because it is smaller than the secondary pulmonary lobule that is the smallest visible structure on HRCT, we believe that the pulmonary acinus is not a replaceable term as the important HRCT unit of the feline (or canine) lung.

Paired inspiratory and expiratory scans and thin section reconstruction (0.625-2 mm slice thickness) 27 provide optimal detail. Normal bronchioles in humans and cats are below the limits of resolution on HRCT, but with dilatation, mural thickening, and intraluminal plugging, small airways become visible. 8 Bronchiolar disorders have characteristic HRCT features, classified as direct or indirect signs. 8, 28 Direct signs imply a change in the walls or lumens of bronchioles resulting in an ability to visualize them. These signs include centrilobular nodules (humans only), tree-in-bud pattern (nodular opacities connected to branching linear structures originating from a single stalk reflective of impacted debris, cells, or fluid within bronchioles), peribronchiolar ground glass opacity or consolidation, and dilatation (bronchiolectasis). 5, 14, 27 Indirect signs reflect changes to the pulmonary parenchyma distal to the diseased bronchiole and include mosaic attenuation (because of air trapping) or, in the setting of bronchiolar disorders, rarely mosaic perfusion. 27 Because air trapping may be imperceptible on inspiratory images, expiratory scans are crucial to accentuate air trapping. 8 Direct findings reflect inflammation or proliferative changes within the bronchiolar lumens, whereas indirect findings reflect fibrosis within the bronchiolar wall (eg, constrictive bronchiolitis). 8 Definitive confirmation of bronchiolar involvement requires histopathology. The microscopic anatomy of bronchioles is similar between humans and cats. Distal bronchioles are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium supported on a thin lamina propria and surrounded by smooth muscle. Airways end as respiratory bronchioles before the alveolar parenchyma in the cat ( Figure 1 ) and in humans. Microscopic morphology has been used to categorize lesions as inflammatory or fibrotic, recognizing there are a limited number of ways airways respond to injury. 9 Inflammatory or cellular lesions often are subcategorized as acute, chronic, acute on chronic, granulomatous, or eosinophilic. Fibrotic lesions reflect the site affected (intraluminal or intramural); overlap in inflammatory and fibrotic changes can be noted within the same patient. 9 Multiple wedge biopsy specimens are recommended to capture patchy and sometimes subtle lesions. 29 A particular histologic pattern of disease may have a wide variety of causes. For example, inflammatory bronchiolitis can be caused by infection, aspiration, transplant rejection, and extension from large airway disease or systemic collagen vascular disease, among other causes. 9 Fibrosis may be a sequela to chronic inflammation so that in end-stage disease, the inflammatory etiology can be missed. Thus, classification schemes based solely on histopathologic features are likely to be less clinically useful, and multidisciplinary F I G U R E 1 Normal cat lung histology (hematoxylin and eosin stain). Terminal bronchioles (TB) are lined by low cuboidal epithelium and surrounded by thin smooth muscle. The airway terminates as respiratory bronchiole (RB) before entering the alveoli input should be sought to allow meaningful interpretation of histologic findings. This should not dampen enthusiasm for the central role of histopathology in an understanding of bronchiolar disorders. In fact, in humans, histopathology may be the only means to document bronchiolar disease in the subset of symptomatic patients with normal lung function (as assessed by spirometry, diffusion capacities, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing) and normal HRCT scans. 30 ",

Analogous disorders occur in cats and will require further efforts among veterinary clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists for full characterization.

Additionally, it is critical to realize that veterinarians are likely to detect bronchiolar disorders late in the disease course for several reasons: (i) cats hide respiratory disease well, (ii) aggressive diagnostic testing, including lung biopsy, is rarely advocated unless underlying disease is serious and there are potentially treatable differential diagnoses, (iii) serious disease is associated with anesthetic risk, and (iv) advanced diagnostic tests are expensive. Detection of end-stage lesions will not provide much needed clues about common underlying etiologies because the inciting factor may be gone, and there are likely many insults that share a final common pathway with similar clinical, physiological, and histologic appearances. 25 At the present, we believe that CT provides the best minimally invasive antemortem evidence of bronchiolar disease in cats.

The cat was 1 among 50 cats housed in a double-wide trailer. Potential inhalant exposures included particulates from clumping cat litter and concentrated bleach used for cleaning. The owner herself recently had been diagnosed with small airway disease. Thoracic radiographs showed hyperinflation, a diffuse bronchial pattern, a multifocal unstructured interstitial pattern with progression toward an alveolar pattern, lung atelectasis, subpleural thickening, and bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis in peripheral opaque regions(Figure 2A, B). The cat did not respond to multiple courses of antibiotics or antifungal drugs but had a partial clinical response to prednisolone. The cat died and was submitted for necropsy. Grossly, the lungs were hyperinflated. Histologically, mixed chronic inflammation involved the pulmonary interstitium and was especially prominent in subpleural areas(Figure 2 C). Respiratory bronchioles were obliterated by loose fibrous tissue (Figure 2 D). The lesions noted in this cat represented a spectrum of early (markedly inflammatory) and late (predominantly fibrosis) foci. Furthermore, although distribution was centered on small airways reflective of a primary bronchiolar disorder, there was extension into the interstitium with a subpleural distribution.

On echocardiography, no evidence of pulmonary hypertension was found. On thoracic CT, multifocal subpleural linear opacities, parenchymal bands, and bronchiolectasis with no air trapping on expiratory breath-hold images were observed (Figure 3 C, D). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology identified 45% nondegenerate neutrophils, and aerobic and anaerobic cultures were negative. Lung biopsy (Figure 4 A-C) disclosed marked inflammation within and around terminal and respiratory bronchioles, with most severe inflammation in subpleural regions. Away from the severe fibrosis and inflammation, inflammation was centered upon respiratory bronchioles. Many of these bronchioles were lined by hyperplastic epithelium and surrounded by thickened smooth muscle.

Cellular bronchiolitis is discriminated from constrictive bronchiolitis in which there is concentric mural fibrosis and narrowing of small airways, and from polyploid bronchiolitis obliterans (PBO; sometimes called proliferative bronchiolitis) To date PBO with organizing pneumonia has been reported in 1 cat and is classified as an interstitial lung disease. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis are thought to be caused by an immune response to specific inhalational triggers in humans. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the lamina propria and submucosa of bronchi and bronchioles of a cat after sudden anesthetic death were noted without histopathologic features supporting asthma or chronic bronchitis (ie, minimal smooth muscle hyperplasia/hypertrophy, airway eosinophils and bronchial gland hyperplasia). 16 A cilia-associated respiratory bacillus-like organism was identified by light and electron microscopy; however, a review of lung tissue sections from other cats submitted for necropsy identified the same organisms that did not correlate with the presence of inflammation or lymphoid hyperplasia, thus casting doubt on a cause-and-effect relationship. Environmental exposures were not described. so until 10 weeks postoperatively. At that time, evaluation of thoracic radiographs indicated dramatic improvement of previously documented lesions in the absence of any treatment (Figure 9 A,B). It was unclear if this improvement was a result of spontaneous remission or waxing and waning disease. Other primary bronchiolar variants are described in Box 5. 7 | SECONDARY BRONCHIOLAR DISORDERS 7.1 | Extension of large airway disease In humans, asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis generally are considered disorders of the central (large) airways. Extension of disease to involve small airways may have important implications for clinical signs and treatment. Bronchiolar inflammation has been described in asthmatic cats 49 and in cats with concurrent chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. 17 7.1.1 | Case 6 A 7-year-old FS Ocicat was presented with a 5-year history of asthma. Diagnosis was based on clinical signs (cough and wheeze), negative fecal and heartworm antigen and antibody testing, lack of response to doxycycline and fenbendazole, serial thoracic radiographs showing a moderate to severe diffuse bronchial pattern and collapse of the right middle lung lobe (Figure 10 A,B), and a BAL finding of eosinophilia. A CT scan performed under sedation 2 years previously was compatible with both large and small airway disease (Figure 10 C-E). The cat's clinical signs were managed with prednisolone and terbutaline until 6 years of age, at which time the cat was refractory to higher doses of glucocorticoids. The cat ultimately was euthanized and histopathology identified severe lymphocytic, plasmacytic, and eosinophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis with bronchiectasia, goblet cell hyperplasia, severe peribronchitis, and arteriolar smooth muscle hypertrophy.7.1.2 | Case 7 A 5-year-old FS DSH cat was presented for chronic cough. No abnormalities were noted on physical examination except obesity. Thoracic radiography disclosed a mild diffuse bronchointerstitial pattern. A trial of fenbendazole did not resolve the cough. Thoracic CT identified wall thickening of segmental and subsegmental bronchi, nodular appearance to the bronchovascular bundle with occasional tree-in-bud pattern, and partial or complete atelectasis of the caudal segment of the left cranial, right cranial, and right middle lung lobes. The central and dependent portions of the right cranial lung lobe were consolidated with visible air bronchograms (Figure 11 A-E). Cytology of BAL fluid identified 70% eosinophils.

With more common use of CT, lesions suggestive of small airway (bronchiolar) disorders are being detected. Clinical signs and some features of thoracic radiographs can be identical for large and small airway disorders, making additional diagnostic testing necessary for definitive diagnosis. We used CT and histopathologic examinations in cats with a wide spectrum of clinicopathologic features allowing proposal of an initial classification scheme for bronchiolar disorders. Broadly, diseases of the bronchioles can be subdivided into primary bronchiolar disorders in which disease originates and is anatomically limited to small airways and secondary bronchiolar disorders at which disease in large airways or the interstitium extends to involve bronchioles. Multidisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists will allow further refinement of the proposed classification scheme. This review represents the first step toward recognizing and understanding a new clinically important category of respiratory disease in the cat. Future studies targeting early recognition and evaluation of therapeutic strategies for bronchiolar disorders in cats are warranted. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Drs.
