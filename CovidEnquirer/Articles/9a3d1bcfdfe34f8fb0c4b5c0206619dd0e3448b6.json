The latter issue is partially solved using correction methods in post-analysis of AVA but the accuracy of these methods is not yet accessed. This study employs two twisted wind profiles to test an urban area in a boundary layer wind tunnel to investigate the influence of twisted wind flows on the outcomes of AVA and to estimate the accuracy of three common correction methods: No-Shift, Threshold, and Proportional methods. The results reveal significant differences in wind speeds at the pedestrian level for twisted and conventional wind flows at locations with low building densities. The discrepancies in wind speeds are minimum at the locations where the density of buildings is high. The indicators calculated by the No-Shift method frequently deviate from those of the twisted wind flows, while the Threshold and Proportional methods routinely overpredict the indicators of AVA.",

AVA's main evaluation criterion is to check whether mean wind speed at the pedestrian level (typically about 1.5 m-2 m above ground) exceeds 1.5 m s \u22121 [1] . The mean wind speed of 1.5 m s \u22121 is the minimum wind speed required to maintain outdoor thermal comfort on a hot, humid summer day in Hong Kong [7] . This criterion takes a different approach than other existing wind ordinances: other criteria tend to cap the allowable wind speed to prevent pedestrian discomfort, even danger, caused by windy conditions [8] [9] [10] .",

In addition, the hilly terrain of Hong Kong frequently produces twisted wind profiles: at different heights within the profile winds have various directions [12] [13] [14] . The authors of this paper have used twisted wind profiles in a series of wind tunnel tests on isolated buildings [16] , arrays of buildings [16] , and a real urban area [17] , and have demonstrated the profiles' considerable influence on the PLW fields in built-up areas. This influence is even more critical on AVA as reported by Tse et al. [12] after analysing data of 256 wind profiles obtained from 13 previous AVAs. In their analysis, Tse et al. [12] revealed that more than 10% of wind profiles have directional deviations larger than 20\u00b0(as much as 40\u00b0) within the lower 500 m of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).",

[15] [16] [17] ), then the reliability of any AVA outcomes will be significantly affected. Although few studies attempted to improve the accuracy of AVA by addressing special environmental conditions such as unstable atmospheric stability [18, 19] , the existence of highly complex terrain [20] , the presence of buildings with different heights [21] , and heterogeneous urban morphology and surface roughness [22] but to the best of the authors' knowledge, no AVA has ever used twisted wind profiles as a boundary condition. This omission is partially attributable to inadequate understanding on simulation techniques, as only limited information has been made available by several studies on yacht sail's aerodynamics [23] [24] [25] [26] and a few PLW studies done by the authors [15] [16] [17] . Constraints in cost, time, and resources pertaining to simulating twisted wind profiles give further reasons for omitting them from AVA.",

Currently, the AVA only adopts corrections methods in post-analysis to adjust these probabilities according to the how wind directions vary in the twisted wind profiles, but these correction methods are empirical: neither their accuracy nor impact on the outcome of AVA is assessed. In fact, without any AVA data obtained using twisted wind profiles, neither the accuracy nor the impact of these correction methods can be assessed, and this needs to be remedied by incorporating twisted wind profiles into AVA, something that has been unavailable to the wind engineering community until now.",

Each sub-goal is achieved by testing a real urban area in a boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) according to AVA guidelines. Two twisted wind profiles with different yaw angles are systematically integrated into AVA, and the impact of twisted wind flows on the outcomes of AVA is estimated by comparing wind speeds under the two twisted wind profiles with wind speeds measured in a conventional wind flow, which has similar wind speeds and turbulence intensity but without any wind twists. Several indicators are calculated based on pedestrian-level wind speeds in the two types of wind flow (i.e., conventional and twisted winds) and are adjusted using the correction methods. The two sets of indicators (original and adjusted) are then compared to estimate the accuracy of the correction methods and their impact on the outcomes of AVA.",

Fig. 6(a) shows the approaching profiles of normalised mean wind speed and turbulence intensity and Fig. 6(b) shows the profiles of yaw angle of the two twisted winds as measured at the centre of the turntable using a Cobra probe. The two twisted wind profiles have similar mean wind speeds and turbulence intensities but different yaw angles at any given height. In fact, the two twisted wind profiles have maximum yaw angles 13\u00b0and 22\u00b0, representing respectively 'moderate' and 'high' deviations in wind directions observed from previous site wind availability studies [12] . Based on these maximum yaw angles, the two twisted wind profiles are hereafter referred to as TWP13 and TWP22. The additional conventional wind profile, which has no yaw angle along the profile's height, was simulated with similar wind speeds and turbulence intensities to the twisted wind profiles and is hereafter referred to as CWP. The CWP is a power-law type wind profile with an exponent of 0.11 and has the mean wind speed of 7.5 m s \u22121 and turbulence intensity of 5.7% at the height of 0.6 m. The height of 0.6 m (240 m in full scale) was selected as the reference height because it was well above the tallest building in the study area.",

First, the VR values are larger than 0.3 in the wind directions, where approaching winds are unobstructed, and second, in these directions, CWP and CWP-TWPs wind flows have larger differences in VRs. The larger VR values, for example, VR = 0.5 in the wind direction 157.5\u00b0at P1 (Fig. 7(a) ), indicate acceptable wind conditions at the perimeter points, which may satisfy the required minimum wind speed of 1.5 m s \u22121 under unobstructed winds. The two types of wind, CWP and CWP-TWPs, can have noticeable differences in VR values under the unobstructed winds as shown in Fig. 7(b) for P2, where a 37% difference in the VR value is observed at 112.5\u00b0. Conversely, the difference in VR value between CWP and CWP-TWPS is minimum if the perimeter points are exposed to the winds that approach from the directions where there are buildings upstream. For example, P1 has identical VR values for CWP and CWP-TWPs in the directions between 225\u00b0to 22.5\u00b0 (Fig. 7(c) ), where the density of upstream buildings is high. Table 2 shows the VR w values and wind speeds with the 50% probability of exceedance calculated for the three perimeter points P1, P2, and P3.

The VR w values calculated by the No-Shift method for the three perimeter points are comparable with those of the CWP-TWPs while the Threshold and Proportional methods underpredict the VR w values by 10%-30% at P2 and P3. At these two test points, the VR w values of the Threshold method are about 10% smaller than the corresponding VR w values of the Proportional method.

High VR values are observed at R1 to R3 for the CWP in the directions approximately parallel to Yeuen Uk road. The high VR values at the roadside points are likely a result of channeled CWP flow through the street canopy. The trend of high VR value at roadside test points is not consistent for the CWP-TWPs, as evident from R1 and R2, for which small VR values are observed in the direction parallel to the road. At these test points, the VR values of the CWP-TWPs in the direction parallel to the road are noticeably different from those of CWP. For example, CWP-TWPs records a 17% higher VR value for R1 at 45\u00b0than CWP ( Fig. 8(b) ), while R2 has a 61% smaller VR value for CWP-TWPs at 67.5\u00b0 (Fig. 8(c) ). In addition, the overall decrease in VR value along the road is dissimilar for CWP and CWP-TWPs. In the wind direction 135\u00b0, the decrease of VR value between test points R1 and R4 is 0.620 for CWP, while the corresponding decrease is about 0.90 for CWP-TWPs. The noticeable differences in VR value and its decrease along the road for CWP and CWP-TWPs shows that the outcome of AVA at roadside test points may vary significantly under the influence of twisted wind flows. The noticeable variations in VR values of CWP and CWP-TWPs at roadside test points diminish near the centre of the study area as both wind flows produce similar VR values at test points R4 and R5 for all wind directions. Similar and uniform magnitudes of VR recorded for CWP and CWP-TWPs relate to the high density of buildings at the centre of the study area, which overrides the influence of twisted winds that approach the site. Table 3 shows the VR w values and wind speeds with a 50% probability of exceedance calculated for the 6 roadside test points. All roadside test points have the VR w value equal to or greater than 0.2 and wind speeds higher than 1.5 m s \u22121 more than 50% of the time. These figures indicate that the wind conditions along Yeung Uk road are In contrast, the Threshold and Proportional methods underestimate the VR w values at all roadside test points. The degree of underestimation varies between 14% and 5% with the larger underestimation found at test points with high wind speeds, and the minimum difference is at the test locations further inside the study area. The VR w values of the Proportional method, which predicts slightly higher VR w values than the Threshold method, are more comparable with the VR w values of CWP-TWPs. Overall, the differences in VR w between the Threshold and Proportional methods indicate that these correction methods are less accurate in predicting the VR w values compared to the VR w values of CWP-TWPs.",

Fig. 9 shows the wind rose diagrams of H1, H4, and H8 near the group of tall buildings. H1 is located near a corner of one of the tall buildings and H7 is in front of the group. H4 is situated near a passage between two tall buildings. The wind rose diagram of H1 ( Fig. 9(a) ) has VR value higher than 0.3, indicating possible windy conditions commonly found near the windward corners of tall buildings [29] [30] [31] . Under windy conditions, the VR values at H1 show some discrepancies between CWP and CWP-TWPs such as in wind directions 337.5\u00b0and 135\u00b0, where the VR values of CWP-TWPs are 59% and 26% smaller than those of CWP. The high VR values of H4 in wind directions of 202.5\u00b0a nd 225\u00b0, as shown in Fig. 9(b) , are likely a result of high-speed wind flow in the passage between two tall buildings.

Nevertheless, the prediction of VR w values by the No-Shift method has a maximum difference of 7% with respect to the VRw values of CWP-TWPs, while the Threshold and Proportional methods have maximum differences of 26.7% and 14.2%, respectively.

The group of buildings is west of the centre of the study area and is bound by Yeung Uk road to the south and by three secondary streets on the other sides. One of the test points, L1 is located in a courtyard and the rest of the test points L2 to L8 are in roadside around the cluster of the buildings. Fig. 10 shows the wind rose diagrams of a test point on Yeung Uk road (L2), a test point in a narrow secondary road (L6) and the test point in the courtyard (L1). Among the three test points, L2 ( Fig. 10(a) ) has a substantially high VR value about 0.5 for both CWP and CWP-TWPs in the wind directions between 225\u00b0to 270\u00b0. The high VR values in these directions may be related to the less obstructed winds that travel along Yeung Uk road and some accelerated wind flows resulted from a \"short-circuiting\" between the positive and negative pressure zones of the surrounding buildings [32] . In some other directions, CWP-TPWs and CWP have different VR values. For example, CWP-TWPs record about 16% higher VR values at 292.5\u00b0and 337.5\u00b0, and a 61.5% smaller VR value at 67.5\u00b0than CWP. Neither high VR values nor significant differences can be identified from the wind rose diagram of L6, as shown in Fig. 10(b) , for CWP and CWP-TWPs. The small but similar VR values of both wind flows may be related the test location, which is on a narrow, secondary road surrounded by closely-spaced low-rise buildings. The VR values of L1 are extremely low for both CWP and CWP-TWPs in all 16 directions as shown in Fig. 10(c) . The small VR values of L1 shows inadequate air circulations in the courtyard under both types of wind flow. Table 5 shows the VR w values and wind speeds with the probability of exceedance of 50% calculated for the 8 test points near the cluster of low-rise buildings. The VR w values of CWP (No-Shift method) and CWP-TWPs are similar for most test points. Even if they are not, the differences are slight. The other two correction methods, Threshold, and Proportional methods have noticeable deviations in VR w value from those of CWP-TWPs. In particular, both Threshold and Proportional methods overpredict the VR w values at test locations such as L2 and L4, which are exposed to less-obstructed wind flows. In contrast to more than 10% difference in VR w values at L2 and L4, test points such as L6 and L1 that are sheltered by surrounding buildings have less or no deviation in VR w value compared with those of CWP-TWPs. The surrounding buildings have a similar effect on wind speeds, for instance, test points exposed to less obstructed winds display large variations in wind speeds in CWP and CWP-TWPs. For example, about 15.6% difference in wind speeds is found between CWP and CWP-TWPs at L2. At locations with high density of surrounding buildings, both CWP and CWP-TWPs produce extremely small but similar wind speeds as reported at L6 and L1. Of note is that while both CWP and CWP-TWPs record below-par standard wind speeds (< 1.5 m s \u22121 ) at most test points, CWP-TWPs show more adverse wind conditions with lower wind speeds than CWP. Such adverse wind conditions would be hidden in the outcomes of AVA if AVA does not use twisted wind profiles as a boundary condition.",
