            "text": "Television shows such as CSI Miami (Crime Scene Investigation) have done much to raise public interest in, and awareness of, the advanced science, technology, detective work, and human knowhow that go into solving serious crimes. They have, however, also created some misconceptions concerning the time it takes to conduct these investigations and the level of resources that firstresponder agencies have at their disposal. In reality, there is room for improvement in all aspects of support for managing criminal events, including in the range of existing database systems and technologies. This chapter outlines some of the most important lessons we have learned from our involvement in the definition, UI design, and usability evaluation of applications intended to support the spot, and identifying potential offending explosive or chemical agents, even before they really know what they are dealing with. There is no way that a team of HCI researchers would be allowed to observe the activities of first responders in a real major CBRNE event, the kind of which has, thankfully, not been experienced in Canada as yet. Instead, simulated events are staged around the country, but as these are extremely time-consuming and expensive to arrange, they occur relatively rarely. In the course of obtaining the necessary data for our HCI tasks, we have had several opportunities to observe, record, and analyze such simulations. Simulated events offer experienced CBRNE teams an opportunity to practice managing these as well as offering additional training for responder teams with limited experience. It is not surprising that few of our standard UCD methods (see e.g., Preece, Rogers, & Sharp, 2011; Shneiderman, Plaisant, Cohen, & Jabobs, 2009 ) apply comfortably in those environments. Still, our team has been able to contribute to the generation of user requirements and UI design, and the UI evaluation of a suite of such applications over the past 10 years.",

A trained bomb technician is responsible for identifying the explosive materials and for preventing further bombs from detonating. He is likely to work closely with the hazmat technician when a \"dirty bomb\" (Dingle, 2005; Petroff, 2003; Zimmerman & Loeb, 2004 ) that may involve nuclear materials or other dangerous chemicals as well as explosives is suspected. If, for example, a suspicious package or backpack with unknown contents has been detected in a public area, the bomb technician and hazmat technician may send in a robot to help in the investigation before allowing people into the hot zone. These robots are equipped with remotely controllable equipment, including mobile video cameras and tools with which to take samples of any chemicals to help identify the offending agent without endangering first responders. The Forensic Identification Specialist (called FIS or \"Ident\") sends his staff into the hot zone once the area has been rendered safe, to collect evidence for a possible subsequent court case. As the interval between the occurrence of an event and the case going to court is often several years, all items found in the hot zone must be given an ID, be photographed, and packaged in several layers of sealed plastic bags for storage. The FIS officer signs each bag as he seals it. If for any reason the item is removed before the court case, it is resealed and the relevant officer again signs each bag. A radiofrequency ID (RFID) tag attached to each exhibit enables the police to retrieve all evidence associated with a given event once the court case goes ahead.",

Their role is to identify the agent as quickly as possible and communicate their findings to the command post team leader. The team leader decides on the level of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that everyone in the hot/warm zones must wear and on the decontamination agent to be used.

By capturing medical information about casualties and allowing different levels of responders to view it, it maintains, or improves, the situational awareness (Artman & Waern, 1999; Garbis & Altman, 2004; Riley, Endsley, Bolstad, & Cuevas, 2006) of the event among the specialists managing the crisis. Figure 7 .1 shows the communication flows and the data sources for people who may be linked to MedPost in the event of a major outbreak. As Figure 7 .1 shows, MedPost can communicate with users in several hospitals and temporary treatment centers. The Rapid Triage Management Workbench, a first-responder triage application that shares critical information among people responsible for first response, casualty care, command and control, and public communication, is used to track, manage, and assign casualties to the proper point of care. It facilitates the triaging of casualties from the event scene through to transport at the hospital by capturing initial medical data in the field (Lindgaard et al., 2006) .

Members of the public have apparently been complaining about extremely foul smells in the streets of Old Montre\u00b4al around that area for over two weeks. However, because garbage handlers have been on strike for the past four weeks, the accumulating garbage in the streets was believed to be the source of the smells. According to the report, a series of at least five deafening explosions occurred in rapid succession around 9:52AM. At least two buses are on fire; the station is apparently in ruins, and it is not known how many passenger trains may also have been hit by the blast.

Therefore, they had produced quite pretty-looking Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages even though none of us knew much about the roles of the different players before the day-long session. Yet, no sooner had the users -in this case, experts who had collaboratively managed the SARS event in 2003 -read the above scenario than they began to act out their respective roles with such an intense urgency and sense of realism that they seemed to have forgotten the artificiality of the situation. No attention whatsoever was paid to the HTML pages displayed on the wall. Perhaps the most important lesson we learned was the kinds of information to which different users must not have access. To keep the Minister of Health and the media informed on progress and prevent accidental information leaks about individual casualties, their present whereabouts, their condition, or any names of people affected, these users must not have access to such detailed information. They see aggregate data only, such as the total number of cases, the number of new cases since the last briefing, the number of suspected and confirmed cases, and the number of deaths believed to be attributable to the event. The coroners' role includes distributing casualties among the surrounding hospitals. The number of patients with severe burns, for example, turned out to be an extremely important item of information for them because there are only eight burns beds in Montr\u00e9al. Before these are filled, information must therefore be obtained about vacant burns beds in hospitals in other cities. Our very first, very crude mock-up HTML draft of the summary screen, which was subsequently shown to the domain experts for comment, is presented in Figure 7 .2. As new information becomes available, the data is automatically updated in MedPost. Two updates are shown, with the most recent report shown next to the relevant field header. Thus the total number of cases (casualties) increased from 17 to 25 in the period 10:20-10:57. Eight new cases had been identified in the intervening period. The user can see when either the minister or the press was last notified, making it easy to focus on the most important data-presented first-namely the total number of cases and the number of new cases since the last report was received. Because the users were able to act out their roles in such detail, the summary screen hardly changed as the design of the application matured. Save for the look and feel of the final application, the content of this crude first prototype for this user population of which the screen in Figure 7 .1 is a part remained virtually unchanged.",

The time is shown in the leftmost column, followed by the source of the original data (video, audio, notes), and then the data obtained from each agency. An ID was assigned to each media file, together with its duration in minutes, both shown in bold in the table. This transcript enabled us to reconstruct the entire event, which was useful for identifying communication breakdowns, and from those, infer user requirements that were then given to the developers and expert responders for discussion and verification. For each of the 47 user requirements thus identified, the times and verbatim sources of the underlying rationale were indicated, enabling the experts directly to access the context of our inference from the transcript. Since we are not domain experts in any of the agencies' fields, this was very valuable; several misunderstandings on our part were identified that had led to misinterpretation, and hence to an unjustified user requirement. These were corrected before coding commenced on the advanced prototype. In the end, however, we only needed data obtained in the first half of the event, when responders and team leaders were making sense of the situation. Once they had identified the chemical agent they were dealing with, the number of casualties and types of injuries had been determined, and decontamination was proceeding, the management process settled into a routine that did not require much system support.

Two important lessons have been learned so far in this project. First, the concept of a \"prototype\" varied considerably among members of the project team, and constraints included the need to work with specific development tools that impose a particular UI style or look and feel. Therefore, even our early prototypes were assessed against the very specific requirements, leaving very little room for \"thinking outside the UI design box\". The second important lesson was that, for this user population, vocabulary, images, and content of the prototypes must precisely match reality and hence the users' rather specific expectations even of an initial low-fidelity prototype. Thus, when turning up to run an extensive, very early prototype pen/paper-based usability test in which we had expected up to 40 participants at a symposium held for first responders from around the country, we were unable to run the test. This was due to concerns with the inaccuracy especially of the images of bomb materials that we had found on the Internet. One screen displaying some of those images is shown in Figure 7 .4.

In MedPost, we were surprised to discover the power of the scenario for revealing details of the experts' roles and responsibilities that rendered the UI design a very easy task. In particular, it was interesting to note the importance of knowing which items of information should not be accessible to some users. In PROBE, we had underestimated the value of linking each user requirement to particular points in the minuteby-minute verbalizations captured in the master data file of the event. In the XIT prototype, we were quite taken aback by the importance to users of including authentic images to illustrate how an imagebased search might work.
