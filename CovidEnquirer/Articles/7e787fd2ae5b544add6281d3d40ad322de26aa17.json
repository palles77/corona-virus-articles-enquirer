In most European Union member states specialized isolation facilities are responsible for the management of such cases. Ground ambulances are often affiliated with those facilities because rapid relocation of patients is most desirable. To date, no pooled data on the accessibility, technical specifications and operational procedures for such transport capacities are available. During 2009, the 'European Network for HIDs' conducted a crosssectional analysis of hospitals responsible for HID patients in Europe including an assessment of (a) legal aspects; (b) technical and infrastructure aspects; and (c) operational procedures for ground ambulances used for HID transport. Overall, 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries were evaluated and feedback rates ranged from 78% to 100% (n \u00bc 37 to n \u00bc 48 centres). Only 46.8% (22/47) of all centres have both national and local guidelines regulating HID patient transport. If recommended, specific equipment is found in 90% of centres (9/10), but standard ambulances in only 6/13 centres (46%). Exclusive entrances (32/45; 71%) and pathways (30/44; 68.2%) for patient admission, as well as protocols for disinfection of ambulances (34/47; 72.3%) and equipment (30/43; 69.8%) exist in most centres. In conclusion, the availability and technical specifications of ambulances broadly differ, reflecting different preparedness levels within the European Union. Hence, regulations for technical specifications and operational procedures should be harmonized to promote patient and healthcare worker safety.",

Furthermore, the emergence of highly-pathogenic respiratory infections (e.g. SARS coronavirus and zoonotic Influenza A viruses), the outbreak of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli infections in Germany and the emerging trends of CrimeaneCongo haemorrhagic fever depict the need of a wellprepared health system when facing a large number of patients with known or unknown infectious agents, routes of transmission and sources of infection [5e10] .",

In Europe, specialized isolation facilities such as 'High Level Isolation Units' are held responsible for the management of cases in a safe clinical environment that minimizes risks for the personnel but allows state-of-the-art critical care [1] . Most often, isolation facilities are located in areas at risk for the occurrence of HIDs such as highly populated cities or are colocated with BSL-4 laboratories and international airports [15] . In contrast, experience gained from VHFs imported to Europe highlighted the fact that suspected cases are often not directly referred to isolation facilities but are encountered in standard hospitals not equipped to provide mid-or long-term care under strict infection control regimens [2, 16] . Hence, patients may need to be relocated to the closest isolation facility available if the clinical conditions allow transportation, although risks for personnel and patients en route must be considered [17] .",

Hence, recommendations for ground ambulances affiliated with such facilities are not considered applicable to large outbreaks.

Hence, shortage of equipment or critical care capacity and the sufficient use of dispatch systems to prioritize capacities do not play a major role here as in other mass casualty incidents [20, 21] . However, providing adequate equipment and vehicles to relocate HID patients remains a critical aspect of preparedness as any mode of transport poses a risk to the patient, personnel on board and the public [17, 22] .

Despite the increasing role of aircraft in trauma care, their use for repatriation of VHF patients is limited and even prohibited by international regulations [23e26]. In addition, training of paramedics for biological events and ground ambulances are broadly accessible, although varying in concepts and outcome [27, 28] . Although required by some of the member states evaluated, the absence of specifically equipped ambulances or of an infection control regimen exceeding the use of droplet precautions for staff did not result in secondary cases of imported VHFs to Europe [2e4,17] . Hence, and in accordance with international guidelines applicable even to smallpox, specific equipment of ambulances is not considered essential by the EUNID consensus [1] . Also, the US consensus considers special air-handling system equipment an 'ideal' situation, not an absolute condition [19] . Nevertheless, allocation of ambulances for HID transport in reduced resource settings may lead to critical shortage for more common medical emergencies such as trauma care. However, in contrast to mass casualties, focusing on small numbers of patients allows an increased attention to the level of infection control policies applied en route and after a patient was delivered to the respective isolation facility. Although infection control regulations for multi-resistant bacteria or other less contagious agents may be sufficient for VHFs, the SARS outbreak in Canada led to a significant shortage of emergency medical service personnel [22, 29] .",

Within the EU, cases can occur in close proximity to countries other than the one initially affected and a patient may have to be relocated to the closest isolation facility available, even if not in the same member state.

National regulations National regulations are defined as laws and recommendations issued by either Ministries (e.g. Ministry of Health) or national institutions (e.g. for occupational health) that must be adhered to by hospitals included in the analysis. Local protocols Local protocols are defined as Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) defining the operational management of HID transport within, to or from the respective isolation facility including clinical care, infection control, disinfection and team management en route. SOPs are written, regularly updated protocols and instructions covering operations, which lend themselves to a definite or standardized procedure without loss of effectiveness. SOPs should be accessible to all staff at any time-point to allow adherence to established procedures [1] . Specifically designed ambulance Ground ambulances are defined as 'specifically designed' for the transportation of HID patients if the ambulance itself and any fixed equipment used can be effectively decontaminated (by wiping, spraying, or fogging with an effective disinfectant) according to national policy. Specific technical features on board may include controlled ventilation, negative pressure, HEPA filtration, intercom systems, aerosol tight storage containers and separation of driver's cabin from patient's cabin [1, 16, 17] . Reserved standard ambulance Reserved ground ambulances for the transportation of HID patients are defined as standard ambulances without additional technical features (see above) but available on call when demanded. Reserved ground ambulances may have easy-to-decontaminate cabin walls and equipment. Strategies should be in place to protect both paramedics and drivers from infectious agents, including the availability of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment [16, 17] .",
