Based on crossreactivities and sequence diversities of VP6, seven to eight groups/species (AeG/H) are distinguished. The surface proteins VP4 and VP7 elicit type-specific neutralizing antibodies. Accordingly, for group A rotaviruses, which cause most human infections, a dual-type classification system has been established, differentiating G types (VP7-specific, G derived from glycoprotein) and P types (VP4-specific, P derived from protease-sensitive protein). At present, 27 G types and 35 P types have been described, of which at least 11 G types and 11 P types have been found in humans. 5 More recently, genotype classification of the other nine RNA segments has been developed, 5 permitting the detailed study of the evolution and transmission pathways of these viruses.",

After virus adsorption to sialic acid, human blood group antigens and various co-receptors, viral replication takes place, first in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies termed 'viroplasms' followed by maturation in contact with the endoplasmic reticulum. Mature particles are released from cells by lysis. 1 Rotavirus replication in the gut is rapid and reaches high titres (up to 10 11 virus particles/ ml faeces at the peak of acute diarrhoea) within a short period of time. The diarrhoea arises from epithelial necrosis and atrophy, leading to reduced absorption of carbohydrates and increased osmotic pressure in the gut lumen. There is also a component of hypersecretion which contributes to the diarrhoea. The rotavirus non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) functions as a viral enterotoxin. 1 Immune response: primary rotavirus infection leads to a serotype-specific humoral immune response with initially monotypic protection. During the first 2 years of life, children are repeatedly infected with rotaviruses of various types, resulting in a more complex immune response that seems to provide partial heterotypic protection. 6 Rotavirus-specific secretory coproantibodies of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) subclass have been identified as an important correlate of protection. 7 Caliciviruses Noroviruses (previously termed 'Norwalk-like viruses') and sapoviruses (previously termed 'Sapporo-like viruses') are the two (out of five) genera of the Caliciviridae family that infect humans. The human noro-and sapoviruses are classified into five to six genogroups (IeVI), with each group containing between 1 and 19 different genotypes. 2 Noroviruses of different genotypes co-circulate but genotype II-4 noroviruses predominate worldwide. Genetic recombination among norovirus and sapovirus strains is not infrequent.",

            "text": "Development of vaccines against viral gastroenteritis has been directed mainly towards rotaviruses, which are a major cause of gastroenteritis and high childhood mortality in developing countries. 8, 12 A live attenuated, rhesus rotavirus-based, human reassortant quadrivalent vaccine eliciting immunity to human rotavirus strains G1eG4 was found to protect significantly against severe disease, including dehydration. It received US Food and Drug Administration approval for universal use in the USA in August 1998, and 1.5 million doses were used between September 1998 and July 1999. However, a Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System found gut intussusception to be a rare complication, epidemiologically correlated with vaccination, particularly on days 3e7 after the first vaccination. The pathogenesis of this association is not clear. Although the vaccine-attributable risk of intussusception was considered very low in recent studies (<1/10,000), the recommendation for use of this vaccine in the USA was withdrawn in October 1999, and it was taken off the market by the manufacturer. 1 In the search for alternative vaccines, two further, live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines have been developed. The underlying concepts of the vaccines are different. The pentavalent vaccine (RotaTeq RTM ), containing the human antigens G1eG4 and P [8] in mono-reassortant viruses on a bovine rotavirus (WC3 strain) genetic backbone, is aimed at eliciting type-specific antibodies against all the rotavirus types that are recognized to circulate most frequently. The rationale of the monovalent vaccine (Rotarix RTM ), an attenuated human G1P [8] strain, is based on two clinical observations. First, crossprotection is accumulated through successive natural infections, and rotavirus disease can be prevented by repeated natural infection. 12 Second, vaccination with one rotavirus type can provide protection, even if subsequent infections are caused by rotaviruses of a different type. It should be noted that, despite considerable work, the exact correlates of protection against rotavirus disease are still not determined. 7, 13 Both vaccines have been found to be effective and safe. 14, 15 They have recently been licensed for sale in numerous countries, and in many of these universal mass vaccination (UMV) against rotavirus disease as part of childhood vaccination schemes has been initiated. In the USA a distinct decline in clinic visits and hospital admissions for rotavirus disease has been ascertained. 16 Clinical trials with the new vaccines in developing countries where they are most needed have shown a decreased efficacy in preventing severe RV disease, 17,18 but due to the high RV-associated mortality in these countries, WHO decided in 2009 to recommend the use of RV vaccination worldwide. 19 As recorded in the USA, 16 in most developed countries where UMV programmes against rotavirus disease have been introduced, a significant decrease of RVassociated diarrhoea requiring medical attention or hospitalization has been observed. In Europe, UMV against rotavirus disease is being carried out in Belgium, Finland, Luxemburg, Austria, and several states of Germany; in the UK, it was announced in November 2012 that rotavirus vaccination would be added to the childhood vaccination schedule planned to begin in September 2013. 20, 21 There will be intense post-marketing surveillance in order to determine the impact of the vaccine and also to monitor the emergence of novel rotavirus strains.",
