            "text": "In March 2003, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients exhibiting atypical pneumonia and subsequently proven to be the causative agent of the disease now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The complete genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has since been sequenced. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV N) shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. To determine if the N protein is involved in the regulation of cellular signal transduction, an ELISA-based assay on transcription factors was used. We found that the amount of transcription factors binding to promoter sequences of c-Fos, ATF2, CREB-1, and FosB was increased by the expression of SARS-CoV N. Since these factors are related to AP-1 signal transduction pathway, we investigated whether the AP-1 pathway was activated by SARS-CoV N protein using the PathDetect system. The results demonstrated that the expression of N protein, not the membrane protein (M), activated AP-1 pathway. We also found that SARS-CoV N protein does not activate NF-jB pathway, demonstrating that activation of important cellular pathways by SAS-CoV N protein is selective. Thus our data for the first time indicate that SARS-CoV has encoded a strategy to regulate cellular signaling process.",

SARS-CoV is markedly different from other members of the Coronaviridae family in that it is the only coronavirus known to cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans [3, 4] .",

Several functions including viral packaging, viral core formation, and vRNA synthesis have been attributed to the coronavirus nucleocapsid [6] . However, the SARS-CoV N protein shares little homology with other members of the coronavirus family. It is noted that SARS-CoV N protein contains a short lysine-rich sequence (KTFPPTEPKKDKKKK TDEAQ) near the carboxyl terminus, which has not been found in any other known coronaviruses (aa 362-381) [7] . Yet, it is likely that this region acts as a nuclear localization signal allowing nucleocapsid protein to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion [8] . Indeed, coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins from all three identified Coronaviridae groups have recently been found to localize in the cytoplasm and nucleus in both virus-infected and plasmid-transfected cells [9] . Furthermore, SARS-CoV N protein is also suspected to be extensively phosphorylated after translation, which may allow it to enter the nucleolus at certain stages of the cell cycle [6] . While inside the nucleolus during interphase, the nucleocapsid protein has an opportunity to interact with a wide variety of regulatory complexes and transcription factors.",

Numerous virus species have also evolved strategies in order to induce or inhibit intracellular host cell signaling through this natural protein mechanism. Viruses such as herpes virus and poxvirus encode proteins that can block regulatory enzymes or mimic natural transcription factors [10, 11] . This beneficial control over the host cell cycle can either facilitate the early release of virus progeny or help the emerging virus evade the host immune system. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid, as discussed above, may also affect host signal transduction pathways resulting in apoptosis, inflammation or other cellular processes. One specific pathway, the activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathway, is a regulator of a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [12] . Therefore it is an attractive target for signal transduction modification by viral proteins.",

Two cell lines were used in this assay, Vero cells, and Hu7 cells. We used pcDNA-N as N protein expression vector pcDNA 3:1\u00f0\u00c0\u00de , and a construct expressing SARS-CoV membrane protein in pcDNA 3:1 (pcDNA-M) to investigate whether NC specifically induces AP-1 signal transduction pathway.

With a decrease in amount of pcDNA-N, Ap-1 activities decreased accordingly in the pCDNA-N transfected cells, clearly suggesting that induction of AP-1 by SARS-CoV N protein is dosedependent. Noticeably, transfection of cells with neither the pcDNA-M nor pcDNA 3:1 vector was found to affect AP-1 activities. To further determine whether this activation is cell-type specific, the Huh7 cells were used under the same experimental conditions.
