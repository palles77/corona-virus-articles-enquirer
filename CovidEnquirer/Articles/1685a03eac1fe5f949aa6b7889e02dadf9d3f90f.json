            "text": "Small RNAs play a critical role in host-pathogen interaction. Indeed, small RNA-mediated silencing or RNA interference (RNAi) is one of the earliest forms of antiviral immunity. Although it represents the main defense system against viruses in many organisms, the antiviral role of RNAi has not been clearly proven in higher vertebrates. However, it is well established that their response to viral infection relies on the recognition of viral RNAs by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to trigger activation of the interferon pathway. In the present work, we report the existence of a novel small noncoding RNA population produced in mammalian cells upon RNA virus infection. Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a prototypic arbovirus model, we profiled the small RNA population of infected cells in both human and African green monkey cell lines. Here, we provide evidence for the presence of discrete small RNAs of viral origin that are not associated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), that are highly expressed and detected by Northern blot analysis, and that accumulate as 21-to 28-nucleotide (nt) species during infection. We report that the cellular antiviral endoribonuclease RNase L cleaves the viral genome, producing in turn the small RNAs. Surprisingly, we uncovered the presence of a modification on the 3=-end nucleotide of SINV-derived viral small RNAs (SvsRNAs) that might be at the origin of their stability. Altogether, our findings show that stable modified small viral RNAs could represent a novel way to modulate host-virus interaction upon SINV infection.",

The arsenal of antiviral defenses and viral counter defense mechanisms is vast and very diverse among the different phyla of life. Plants, insects, nematodes, and fungi mostly (if not exclusively) rely upon an innate immune response, whereas mammals have evolved an adaptive response in addition to this first line of defense. In the former organisms, the antiviral component of the innate immune response is mainly based on a highly conserved process commonly referred to as RNA silencing, or RNA interference (RNAi). In this phenomenon, long double-stranded RNAs of viral origin are cleaved by the RNase Dicer into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are then assembled into effector complexes that contain a member of the Argonaute (Ago) family; this results in targeted degradation of viral messenger or genomic RNAs (1) .",

            "text": "Although extensive deep sequencing analyses have been performed to identify siRNAs in mammalian cells infected with several RNA viruses, there is so far no good evidence for a possible antiviral role of RNAi in mammalian somatic cells (7) . Nevertheless, another class of small noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), has been shown to play an important role during viral infection in mammals. miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved small RNAs derived from large primary transcripts, which are sequentially processed by the respective nuclear and cytoplasmic RNase III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, to generate mature single-stranded~21-or 22-nucleotide (nt) RNAs (8, 9) . Similar to siRNAs, they are incorporated into an effector Ago-containing RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whereby they mediate posttranscriptional regulation of target mRNAs via partially complementary sites (10) . On one hand, miRNAs of cellular origin can directly or indirectly regulate viral infections (11, 12) . On the other hand, some viruses have evolved the capacity to encode their own miRNAs, which represent an ideal tool to stealthily modulate the cellular environment. To date, viral miRNAs have been almost exclusively identified in the genomes of DNA viruses, mostly herpesviruses (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) , with the notable exception of bovine leukemia virus, a retrovirus with an RNA genome (18) . It has been commonly assumed that cytoplasmic RNA viruses cannot encode miRNAs, not only because they do not have access to the nuclear biogenesis machinery but also because their genomic integrity would be destabilized by miRNA processing (19) . Nevertheless, it has recently been demonstrated that the insertion of a cellular miRNA precursor into the 3=-end nontranslated region (NTR) of Sindbis virus (SINV) genomic RNA leads to its cytoplasmic processing without affecting the viral replication (20, 21) .",

Some of these small RNAs accumulate to levels detected by Northern blot analysis. We set out to identify the factors involved in their biogenesis and show that they do not depend on the RNA silencing machinery, but rather, that they are downstream products of the cytoplasmic IFN-induced endoribonuclease RNase L. Finally, we also present experimental evidence that these viral small RNAs are modified at their 3= extremity. Altogether, our results indicate that the SINV-derived small RNAs could represent key markers of the host defense mechanism.",

In mammalian cells, the host defense mechanism relies on the recognition of viral RNAs, resulting in the activation of type I interferons (IFNs). In turn, the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is induced to inhibit viral replication. Here we report that the cytoplasmic, interferon-induced, cellular endoribonuclease RNase L is involved in the accumulation of a novel small RNA population of viral origin. These small RNAs are produced upon SINV infection of mammalian cells and are stabilized by a 3=-end modification. Altogether, our findings indicate that in our system RNA silencing is not active against Sindbis virus (SINV) and might open the way to a better understanding of the antiviral response mediated by a novel class of small RNAs."

Using these conditions, we could detect cells with a high viral load without observing any apparent cell death as assessed by propidium iodide staining (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We also confirmed that until 24 hpi, cells were still actively proliferating (data not shown). High-throughput sequencing yielded 201,793 and 1,193,893 reads that mapped to the SINV genome in infected HEK293 and Vero cells, respectively (Fig. 1A) ; these two numbers of reads represented a percentage of 1.66 and 7.99%, respectively, of total mapped small RNAs in HEK293 and Vero cells. The greater fraction of viral reads in Vero cells is consistent with the fact that these cells are known to be more permissive to viral infections due to a defect in interferon production (26) . The distribution of the reads on the viral genomic (positive) and antigenomic (negative) strands is indicated in Fig. 1A . Interestingly, the vast majority of the reads (98 to 99%) originate from the genomic strand of the virus. Nonetheless, we identified limited sequencing reads that were derived from the negative strand, albeit at extremely low levels in both libraries (Fig. 1A) . Their genomic distribution showed a peak at the 3= end of the antigenome (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). This specific region corresponds to the viral promoter, necessary for the replication of the viral genome and is known to fold into a conserved 44-nt stemloop structure (25) . The length distribution of the antigenomic small RNA reads peaked at a size of 22 nt (Fig. S2B) , which corresponds to the 5= arm of the stem-loop structure (Fig. S2C ). Although we could validate the presence of the 44-nt-long RNA by Northern blot analysis, we were unable to detect the accumulation of the small 22-nt RNA as a discrete species (Fig. S2D) .",

The identification of small RNAs from RNA viruses could be seen either as a result of a productive mechanism for the pathogen (as for virus-encoded miRNAs) or as the consequence of a host response to control the infection by degrading viral RNAs. SINV expresses four enzymes that play key functions during the viral replicative cycle. However, none of these enzymes is known to possess an endoribonuclease activity (22) that could enable the processing of small RNAs from a viral RNA precursor. Therefore, cellular enzymes have to be involved in the biogenesis of SINV sRNAs. In order to identify them, we decided to knock down cytoplasmic enzymes with a known RNase activity. We first focused on proteins important for the production of small RNAs, such as miRNAs. Hence, we transfected siRNAs against Drosha, Dicer, or Ago2 followed by an infection with SINV and an analysis of viral small RNA accumulation. Although Drosha is known to be mostly nuclear, we also took it into consideration because it was recently shown to relocalize to the cytoplasm upon SINV infection (21) . Although we were able to downregulate very efficiently Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2 (see Fig. S4A to C in the supplemental material), the knockdown of these factors neither affected the viral load nor the accumulation of SvsRNA-1, -2 and -3 ( Fig. S4D to G). We also examined whether we could detect an siRNA signature among all viral reads by looking for small RNAs that could perfectly base pair on 19 or 20 nt and present a 2-nt overhang in 3=. A very limited number of such duplexes could be found, but they were not more represented than larger duplexes presenting with 3= or 5= overhangs (data not shown). It has been reported that small RNAs, which are not generated by Dicer or Drosha cleavage, could nevertheless be assembled into Argonaute proteins (e.g., tRNA fragments [27] ). We therefore immunoprecipitated Argonaute proteins followed by Northern blot analysis to see whether SvsRNAs could be detected within the RISC. However, although we could detect the accumulation of the cellular miRNA miR-16, using both an antibody specific for Ago2 (Fig. S4H , left panel) and an antibody able to recognize all four Ago proteins (Fig. S4H , right panel), we were unable to detect SvsRNAs within immunoprecipitated RISC.",

We therefore looked for other factors implicated in RNA degradation that could affect SvsRNA accumulation. We used RNAi to downregulate the expression of the major cytoplasmic 5=-3= exoribonuclease Xrn1 (Fig. 2D ). As expected, the capped viral genome was not affected by downregulation of Xrn1 (Fig. 2E) . However, the levels of SvsRNA-1, -2, and -3 and their precursors were stabilized (Fig. 2F) . We then looked at the effect of combining knockdown of these factors (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). We found that the double knockdown of both RNase L and Dicer did not affect the accumulation of SvsRNA-1 compared to the single RNase L knockdown, which confirms that Dicer does not play a role (Fig. S6A) . On the contrary, the accumulation of SvsRNA-1 upon double knockdown of both RNase L and Xrn1 increased compared to the single RNase L knockdown (Fig. S6A ). This finding suggests that both RNase L and Xrn1 can act upon viral RNAs and have opposite activities in terms of generation and stabilization of the SvsRNAs. Xrn1 might act upstream of RNase L in degrading, for example, uncapped viral RNAs that would otherwise be a substrate for RNase L; alternatively, it could directly act upon the RNase L products. The former hypothesis is more likely though because Xrn1 has a preference for 5= phosphorylated RNAs, whereas RNase L leaves a 5= OH after cleavage. We also performed a high-molecular-weight Northern blot analysis to look at the effects of the various knockdowns on the accumulation of the genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs.",

For a control for the reaction, we measured its effect on the unmodified cellular miRNA miR-16. As expected, the electrophoretic mobility of the miRNA strongly changed after treatment (Fig. 3B) . In contrast, SvsRNA-1 mobility was found to be insensitive to periodate oxidation and \u2424-elimination (Fig. 3B) . This indicated the presence of a modification on the terminal ribose, most likely in the 2= position, which is perfectly compatible with our cloning protocol. Interestingly, it also seems that the intermediate RNA products are insensitive to periodate oxidation and are consequently modified (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material).

After retrotranscription with low and high dNTP concentrations, we performed multiplex PCR using primers F U /F D1 (in the SvsRNA-1 region) or primers F D1 /F D2 (in the control region) and then compared the signal intensity ratios of PCR products amplified with different numbers of PCR cycles (Fig. 4B ). Our data indicated that only the F U /F D1 ratio changed depending on the RT conditions (Fig. 4B, top panel) , suggesting that at a low dNTP concentration, the reverse transcriptase paused in the SvsRNA-1 region, most probably due to the presence of a modification on the viral genome in the region of interest.",

When it comes to viral infection, one of the most potent PAMPs is dsRNA. The recognition of dsRNA by PRRs triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the activation of interferon-sensitive genes (ISGs) (40) . RNA silencing is another type of antiviral innate immunity, which, as of now, has mostly been demonstrated in plant and insect organisms (1). Nonetheless, a role for RNA silencing as a host defense system against mammalian viruses could reasonably be considered. Indeed, Dicer, the key enzyme for dsRNA cleavage is conserved in higher vertebrates, and although its main substrate in vivo is pre-miRNA molecules, it is able to process long dsRNA into short RNAs in vitro (41) . However, the question as to which other types of dsRNA molecules mammalian Dicer can cleave in vivo has been the matter of intense research, and especially so when considering RNAs of viral origin. Here, we wanted to make our contribution to the field by studying the prototypical arbovirus, Sindbis virus. This type of virus can infect both insects and mammals, and as such is a useful tool to study the conservation of antiviral mechanisms in both phyla. Intriguingly, it has been shown for some members of the alphavirus genus that their genomic RNA can be processed into both siRNAs and piRNAs in insect somatic cells (42, 43) .",

Although the percentage of sequences mapping to the viral genome was significant (~1.7 to~8% in HEK293 and Vero cells, respectively), we were unable to detect either siRNA or piRNA signatures. On the contrary, the viral reads displayed a highly biased strand distribution. Although antigenomic (negative) strand-derived sequences represented a very small percentage of the total viral reads, they showed properties distinct from the genomic (positive) strand reads: their size distribution peaked at 22 nt, and their localization on the viral genome is restricted to the promoters required for the synthesis of both the genomic and subgenomic RNA. Although the cloned 22-nt sequences were not visible by Northern blot analysis, we could detect the accumulation of an~44-nt product that in our knowledge has never been observed before. We hypothesize that these RNA species could be critical for viral replication, similarly to what has been previously reported for influenza virus (44) .",

These Svs-RNAs do not display any peak in size distribution and do not map to any alphavirus conserved regions. Nonetheless, we noticed that they originate from the same viral genomic positions in both infected African green monkey and human cells.

One hypothesis regarding their identity could be that some of these SvsRNAs are in fact virus-encoded miRNAs. Using bioinformatics tools such as miRDeep2 (45, 46) and miRanalyzer2 (47, 48) , we excluded the possibility that putative miRNA precursor structures were present in the viral genome. Nonetheless, we tested whether the miRNA machinery was required for the production of viral small RNAs by knocking down Drosha, Dicer, and Ago2. The downregulation of these factors affected neither SINV replication nor accumulation of the three most abundant identified SvsRNAs, indicating that their production must involve another RNase. We discovered that the RNase L endonuclease is implicated in SvsRNA genesis. Indeed, its downregulation causes a dramatic reduction in the accumulation of Sindbis viral small RNAs detected by Northern blot analysis; this is accompanied by an upregulation of the viral genomic RNA. In order to extend this observation, we also generated small RNA libraries from HEK293 cells treated with siRNAs against RNase L and infected with SINV. We found that, under these conditions, the global population of SINV sRNAs was downregulated. RNase L is an endoribonuclease that is present in the cell in the form of an inactive monomer. Upon type I interferon induction, and more specifically 2=-5= oligoadenylate synthetase activation (6) , it can dimerize and then act upon its viral RNA targets. RNase L is known to play an antiviral role against viruses such as West Nile virus (49), hepatitis C virus (50) , and SINV (51) . We also looked at the involvement of exoribonucleases in the production of SvsRNAs and found that, indeed, the accumulation of these small RNAs is counteracted by the cellular 5=-3= exonuclease Xrn1. This suggests that SvsRNAs represent stable viral products of cellular decay enzymes. We therefore hypothesize that RNase L is the enzyme primarily involved in the generation of small RNAs and that the further processing operated by other uncharacterized enzymes could give rise to the final 20-to 30-nt-long viral RNAs. It also remains possible that some of the fragments we detected are direct products of RNase L but are further modified by kinases and dephosphorylases, which would allow their cloning.",

Thanks to a double approach of RTL-P and primer extension, we were able to map such a modification on position A 8333 of the SINV viral genome.

Cellular RNAs contain many distinct posttranscriptional modifications at thousands of sites.

This could be due to the fact that other enzymes might also be involved in the production of RNA fragments and is an indication that it will make the detection of antiviral RNAi complicated in differentiated mammalian cells. An alternate hypothesis could also be that SINV encodes an RNA silencing suppressor that blocks Dicer activity but has no effect on RNase L. Finally, it is also possible that the antiviral RNAi response might be detected only in specific subtypes of cells in mammals, which would be different from the differentiated somatic cells we used for our study.

Small RNA libraries from SINV-infected HEK293 cells treated with control or RNase L-specific siRNAs were generated following the same protocol with some modifications. Mainly, small RNAs were ligated using degenerate 5= and 3= adapters to limit biases in the ligation step (56) . This procedure was also used to prepare small RNA libraries after NaIO 4 treatment of 100 g of total RNA, as previously described (57) , except that the 3= ligation was performed at 16\u00b0C overnight, in 12% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) to favor the cloning of modified small RNAs. Sequencing was performed at the IGBMC Microarray and Sequencing platform, Illkirch, France, using different Illumina instruments (Genome Analyzer IIx, HiSeq 2000, and HiSeq 2500) with a read length of 36 or 50 bp.",
