After my election as WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean in January, 2012, my fi rst task was to work closely with WHO member states to agree on an agenda to address these challenges. A series of high-level consultations was held with countries and experts, after a process of objective analysis of the health situation in the countries of the region. It is a region of great diversity. Although many countries, both Arab and non-Arab, have made great gains and have built extensive modern networks of health infrastructure with wide deployment of medical technologies, these gains have not been shared across and within countries. Many of the challenges cut across the health sector and are shared by all countries.",

Although these directions were intended to guide the work of WHO, their focus and nature make them applicable for a much broader range of stakeholders and partners.",

Accelerating progress towards universal health coverage by reforming health systems is top priority for WHO in the region. The aim is to ensure access for all people to quality health services without risk of fi nancial hardship. This is a diffi cult challenge considering the current low levels of prepayment schemes and high out-of-pocket health expenditures in many countries. With support from WHO, and working closely with the World Bank and other partners, countries are beginning to develop a vision, Responding to priority health challenges in the Arab world I owe special thanks to a large network of Arab scientists who have contributed to this Series. Special thanks go to Huda Zurayk, Rita Giacaman, Samer Jabbour, and Iman Nuwayhid for their persistent and exceptional commitment to this project. Thanks also to IDRC for fi nancial support, and to the Faculty of Health Sciences at the American University of Beirut for hosting our planning and peer review meetings. evidence-based strategies, and road maps to move toward universal health coverage. Some countries have started to plan comprehensive reforms, including in health fi nancing, adopting a multisectoral approach. Another priority is the unfi nished agenda of communicable diseases. Despite commendable progress in past decades in reducing the burden of these diseases, important challenges remain and new ones continue to emerge. The coverage and quality of immunisation programmes vary. Viral hepatitis and malaria are major health problems in some countries. The region has the fastest rate of increase among WHO regions in the number of HIV infections and the lowest coverage with antiretroviral therapy. It also has two of the world's three remaining pockets of polio. Recent outbreaks in countries that had been free of polio for many years represent a major impediment to global eradication eff orts, and led ministers of health to declare polio a regional emergency and mount a comprehensive response. 3 New infections, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome, also continue to emerge. Although the 2005 International Health Regulations provide a framework for countries to respond to acute public health threats, countries need to do more to meet the requirements set by the World Health Assembly for achieving the core capacities for surveillance and response by June, 2014, at the latest. 4 A third priority is maternal and child health; 899 000 chil dren younger than 5 years and 39 000 mothers needlessly die each year in the region from avoidable causes. At the present rate of action, the region as a whole will not be able to achieve Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5. A regional response, the Dubai Declaration for Saving the Lives of Mothers and Children, 5 has been launched, and national acceleration plans are being implemented in high-burden countries, which include seven Arab countries.",

However, countries have adopted a regional framework for action specifying commitments to implement strategic interventions in governance, prevention of risk factors, surveillance, and health care. 8 Some progress is being made but gaps in action remain.",

The calls for freedom, social justice, and human dignity that resonate within the Arab world have been heard loud and clear but, as yet, are not refl ected in a new development paradigm. The legitimate aspirations of the Arab population are suff ocated by deeply polarised societies and a very narrow interpretation of social justice. These two deterrents are a manifestation of failure of the development trajectory to embrace fairness and inclusiveness as core prerequisites for individual and social wellbeing. Development has emphasised economic growth and access to services, and employed a narrow translation of social justice in terms of provision of minimum basic needs to the poorest populations. As a result, many Arab countries (eg, those of the Persian Gulf, Libya, Lebanon, Algeria, and Tunisia) have been placed in very high or high ranks in terms of the Human Development Index. 1 Other Arab countries, including those in the low Human Development Index rank, have managed to achieve great improvements on economic and health fronts. 2 Notably, before the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, these countries were complimenting themselves on such economic and health improvements and on commitments to poverty reduction. 3, 4 So where did the Arab world go wrong? The people of the region provided the answer to this question. Protesters on the streets of Cairo, Egypt, and in Tunisia were asking for fair employment, and recognising that jobs and rewards are off ered on the basis of family connections and political affi liations. Young women were making their voices heard by objecting to the continuous assault on their public spaces. Lowincome and underserved communities were asking for their just entitlements. They all demanded freedom of expression, political voice, and protection from police brutality. They recognised social justice as fairness in the creation of participatory opportunities, and in empowerment not restricted to remedial welfare handouts.",

This movement is explicit in crystallising the key diff erences between a social determinants approach to health and a social justice approach to health equity. The social justice approach is not about the size of resources, but their fair allocation and distribution, and contributes an additional value judgment to health equity. It considers health inequality as unfair, not only because it involves denial of a human right, 7 but also because it expresses the inequitable distribution of power, money, and resources.
