In the context of Article 14 of the revised European Bathing Waters Directive 2006/7/EC (rBWD, CEU, 2006) a Europe-wide surveillance study was carried out to determine the frequency of occurrence of two human enteric viruses in recreational waters. Adenoviruses were selected based on their near-universal shedding and environmental survival, and noroviruses (NoV) selected as being the most prevalent gastroenteritis agent worldwide. Concentration of marine and freshwater samples was done by adsorption/elution followed by molecular detection by (RT)-PCR. Out of 1410 samples, 553 (39.2%) were positive for one or more of the target viruses. Adenoviruses, detected in 36.4% of samples, were more prevalent than noroviruses (9.4%), with 3.5% GI and 6.2% GII, some samples being positive for both GI and GII. Of 513 human adenovirus-positive samples, 63 (12.3%) were also norovirus-positive, whereas 69 (7.7%) norovirus-positive samples were adenovirus-negative.

            "text": "Enteric viruses have frequently been implicated in recreational water-related gastro-intestinal (G.I.) disease (Sinclair et al., 2009) . Studies in Europe and the US suggest that most infections contracted as a result of swimming, canoeing or other recreational use of sewage-polluted water may be viral in nature (e.g. Medema et al., 1995; Gray et al., 1997) . Enteric viruses may cause asymptomatic or mild infections in humans, but these faecal-orally transmitted viruses may also cause more serious disease, such as hepatitis and meningitis, especially in vulnerable groups, e.g. young children (Nwachuku and Gerba, 2006) . Enteric viruses are recognized as agents that can cause large outbreaks throughout the world with thousands of cases (Sarguna et al., 2007; Bucardo et al., 2007; Iijima et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009) . Novel emerging viruses such as SARS coronavirus, human parechovirus and zoonotic influenza viruses also appear to be excreted in faeces but the evidence for enteric transmission is not always clear (Ding et al., 2004) . Transmission routes for enteric viruses may be diverse such as personeperson, food-or waterborne associated with insufficient hygiene and sanitation Wyn-Jones and Sellwood, 2001) . Disease outbreaks associated with enteric viruses, such as noroviruses and astroviruses, in bathing water have been described (Hauri et al., 2005; Maunula et al., 2004) . However, bathing water-related outbreaks may be easily missed due to either unidentified source or unidentified agent, or both. Enteric viruses in water may originate from discharges of raw or treated sewage, run-off of animal manure or directly from humans or animals. Viruses commonly associated with waterborne disease include the human adenoviruses (HAdVs), noroviruses (NoVs), hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV, HEV), parvoviruses, enteroviruses, and rotaviruses (RVs). In addition, sewage, especially from slaughterhouses, may contain (for example) animal adenoviruses, sapoviruses, and HEV (Hundesa et al., 2006) , which may be zoonotic. Viruses originating from (un)treated sewage can contaminate bathing water after discharge into surface waters (in)directly used for recreational water activities. All are capable of infection by ingestion. Some multiply in the intestine and may cause diarrhoea and/or vomiting, while some are associated with tissues (e.g. the liver) other than the gut. The viruses responsible for waterborne infections are not usually identified at the time of a disease outbreak following recreational water activity, and robust associations between the simultaneous presence of virus in faeces of affected individuals and in the water are only occasionally demonstrated (e.g. Hoebe et al., 2004) . The epidemiological picture of disease associated with recreational use of water is therefore far from complete, and measures to limit enteric disease after exposure to recreational water are based on water quality parameters built on the detection of faecal bacterial indicator organisms (FIOs). However, it has been shown that water conforming to bacterial standards may contain high levels of human enteric viruses and that FIOs often fail to predict the risk for waterborne pathogens including enteric viruses (Gerba et al., 1979; Lipp et al., 2001) . Further, several studies have shown that levels of indicator bacteria do not correlate with those of viruses, particularly when faecal indicator concentrations are low (Contreras-Coll et al., 2002) . Viruses are known to be more resistant to environmental degradation than bacteria (Vasl et al., 1981; Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003; Rzezutka and Cook, 2004; de Roda Husman et al., 2009) . Together with the understanding that G.I. illness may be due to viruses rather than bacteria, this provides a case for using a viral indicator of human faecal pollution rather than to rely exclusively on bacterial parameters.",

However, cell culture-based methods for viral detection are costly, require specialised skills and equipment, and have too long a turnaround time. For this reason, the EU Framework 6 Project VIROBATHE was done to devise a robust, rapid and cost-efficient method for routine compliance monitoring of enteric viruses in recreational waters. Part of the work involved Europe-wide surveillance of recreational waters to determine the frequency of target virus occurrence and, to a limited extent, serotypes and quantities. So that the virus levels could be seen in the context of compliance-related water quality, the work also included determination of FIO levels to provide general water quality data. The viruses selected as targets were adenoviruses and noroviruses. The former are shed by many individuals (often without showing symptoms), they are more environmentally robust than enteroviruses (Enriquez et al., 1995; Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003) , they have been found in surveys of polluted waters (e.g. Pina et al., 1998; Laverick et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004; Miagostovich et al., 2008) , and have been associated with outbreaks of disease in swimming pools (e.g. Papapetropolou and Vantarakis, 1995; Harley et al., 2001) and other recreational waters (Sinclair et al., 2009) . Being DNA viruses, their detection by PCR does not have the problems associated with the genetic variation seen with RNA viruses. They are also more likely to be detected in recreational water samples (e.g. Pina et al., 1998; Miagostovich et al., 2008) , especially if sensitive nucleic acid detection methods are used, and they may therefore provide the best indicator of viral faecal pollution. Noroviruses are the most important cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in people of all age groups and many waterborne outbreaks have been reported. Sinclair et al. (2009) reviewed 55 recreational water-related G.I. disease outbreaks of which 25 (46%) were reported as caused by noroviruses.",

Prior to the surveillance stage several different methods were evaluated (see Section 3.1) using HAdV2 and NoV GII.4, and the best in terms of virus recovery and capital/recurrent costs was selected. The HAdV2 was obtained from the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV), where the virus genome was authenticated. Virus was grown and assayed by plaque assay in A549 cultures and distributed by the HPA Environmental Virology Unit to other laboratories. Norovirus GII.4 was identified in a faecal sample from an outbreak in a care home and the identity confirmed by sequencing. End-point dilution assay by RT-PCR gave a titre of 10 \u00c09 . The suspension was distributed at 10 \u00c03 which provided sufficient virus for evaluation and quality control purposes for all laboratories throughout the project. Process characterisation was done by four experienced laboratories concentrating replicate samples of water spiked with HAdV2 and analysing the concentrates for recovered virus.",

No infectivity assay was performed if the adenovirus nested-PCR on all four concentrates was negative. At least two 25 cm 2 flasks, each containing a monolayer of confluent A549 cells (European Collection of Cell Culture, ECACC, UK) were inoculated with 1 mL of sample concentrate. At least one flask was incubated for five days (T \u00bc 5). One flask was analysed without incubation (T \u00bc 0), to guard against detection of seed virus. One negative control with cell culture medium only was set up. Following incubation, flasks in the first set (T \u00bc 5) were frozen and thawed three times and the separated supernatant analysed by the adenovirus nested PCR. A positive nested-PCR signal after five days, coupled with a negative reaction after zero days (confirming that inoculum was not being detected) was taken as evidence of virus multiplication, and hence of infectivity.",

Accordance (repeatability of qualitative data) was defined as the percentage chance of finding the same result, positive or negative, from two identical samples analysed in the same laboratory under predefined repeatability conditions, and concordance (reproducibility of qualitative data) was defined as the percentage chance of finding the same result, positive or negative, from two identical samples analysed in different laboratories under predefined repeatability conditions. These calculations take into account different replication in different laboratories by weighting results appropriately. The concordance odds ratio (COR) was the degree of inter-laboratory variation in the results, and expressed as the ratio between accordance and concordance percentages (Langton et al., 2002) . The COR value may be interpreted as the likelihood of getting the same result from two identical samples, whether they are sent to the same laboratory or to two different laboratories. The closer the value is to 1.0, the higher is the likelihood of getting the same result. Confidence intervals for accordance, concordance and COR were calculated by the method of Davison and Hinckley (1997) ; each laboratory was considered representative of all laboratories in the \"population\" of laboratories, not just those participating in this analysis.",

Across all evaluating laboratories, concentration of HAdV2 in spiked freshwater samples by glass wool with elution using beef extract gave a mean recovery of 57.1% (range 34.2%e78.2%), while concentration of virus in spiked artificial seawater samples with skimmed milk elution gave a mean recovery of 35.4% (range 22.5%e43.8%).

From the overall surveillance data 553 out of 1410 samples (39.2%) were positive for one or more of the target viruses (Fig. 2) . This corresponded to 582 virus detections, some samples being positive for more than one kind of virus. Adenoviruses were detected more often than noroviruses, 513 (36.4%) samples being positive for one or more human adenovirus types, while 132 samples (9.4%) tested positive for one or both norovirus genogroups; these were divided between GI (49, 3.5% samples positive) and GII (88, 6.2%, Fig. 2 ).

Human adenoviruses were detected in all except two sites, one marine and one fresh water. Sites were chosen on the basis of their recreational use, and most were impacted by sewage effluent. Among the marine sites, 55% of samples from Pomezia, Rome, were positive for HAdV, while none was found at one of the Barcelona sites (though more samples were positive at the second site), and none was detected at Larnaca, Cyprus, where it is known no sewage is discharged. Among the freshwater sites, no HAdV was found at Kirchentellinsfurt Lake in Baden-W\u00fc rttemberg, while 80% of samples were HAdV-positive at Amper Grasslfing in Bavaria and 91% were positive at the site at Tomblaine, Nancy, a site well recognised for its anthropogenic effects as well as its recreational activities (mainly canoeing). With respect to noroviruses, five out of 11 marine water sites, and four out of 13 freshwater sites gave samples positive for GI noroviruses, the highest recovery from a marine site being 30% of samples positive at Pomezia (Rome), and that from a freshwater site being 10% of samples positive at Reading. Genogroup II noroviruses were detected at eight marine and eight freshwater sites, the highest frequencies being 16.3% positive samples at Ardea (Rome, marine), and 15% at Durgerdam (freshwater). Overall, the data showed that adenoviruses were present at more sites than noroviruses. Some sites had more than 25% samples virus-positive in respect of both adenoviruses and noroviruses. To illustrate the distribution of sites relative to the frequency of virus detection, Fig. 4 (marine sites) and Fig. 5 (freshwater sites) show the frequencies of positive samples divided into five groups (0%, 1e25%, 26e50%, 51e75% and 76e100% positive samples) plotted against the number of sites in each group. Thus there was, for example, one of the 11 marine sites which reported no samples being HAdV-positive, five sites in which between 1% and 25% samples were HAdV-positive, three sites between 26% and 50% and two sites with between 51% and 75% HAdV-positive (Fig. 4) .

            "text": "This study has shown clearly that it is possible to use relatively straightforward methods for the detection of two important enteric viruses in water samples across a range of geographical sites with varying degrees of pollution. The common occurrence of adenoviruses (36.4% of samples tested) reflected the intermittent shedding of these viruses in the faeces by most adults. The difference in w a t e r r e s e a r c h 4 5 ( 2 0 1 1 ) 1 0 2 5 e1 0 3 8 detection frequency may have been due to the greater dispersing and diluting power of the sea compared with that of the fresh waters. Alternatively, viruses may be less stable in marine waters due to the higher salt content, especially with higher temperatures (Hawley and Garver, 2008; Lo et al., 1976) . The frequent detection of HAdVs by most laboratories reflected their known environmental robustness; though it was not possible to perform ICC-PCR on all the adenovirus-positive samples and thus show that all contained infectious viruses, it is known that adenoviruses can persist in an infectious state in various environments over long periods (Rzezutka and Cook, 2004) . Charles et al. (2009) found a strong relation between PCR detection and infectivity of adenovirus Type 2 in groundwater over one year. Although noroviruses are spread principally by person-toperson transmission, environmental spread is also important, for instance in outbreaks associated involving drinking water (e.g. Hewitt et al., 2007) and consumption of bivalve molluscs (Lees, 2000) . In this study, the high frequency of NoV GI detection in two Laboratories suggests a higher level in the environment than was demonstrated by consideration of the rest of the data for this virus. Detection of GI noroviruses in the environment is not matched by their detection in clinical samples; GI NoV strains have been detected frequently in sewage, effluent, and surface waters (da Silva et al., 2007; Katayama et al., 2008; Myrmel et al., 2006) , which contributes to the view that many norovirus infections are symptomless, with GI viruses being under-represented among those found in clinical cases. It is unclear whether this relates to our data as most of the GI isolates were found in only four sites. The frequency of GII norovirus detection (approximately 6%) was as expected. It is commonly accepted that norovirusrelated disease shows a seasonal trend, with most outbreaks and sporadic cases occurring in winter. Whilst it would have been interesting to obtain a temporal distribution of environmental norovirus detection similar to that of Nordgren et al. (2009) , this was not feasible in this study since it was specifically planned to be related to the EU bathing season, and in any case RT-PCR detection might not have provided resolution high enough to show temporal differences in norovirus levels. Further studies are planned using a norovirus QPCR to investigate this aspect.",

Recovery values of 49% (seeded fresh water) and 37% (seeded artificial sea water) were considered acceptable, though variations between laboratories prevented direct statistical comparisons of performance, and a modified method for marine water samples was developed during the project (Calgua et al., 2008) . The percentage of correctly identified positive samples was around 90%, except for HAdV in freshwater, which showed a sensitivity of 77%, while the specificity of the methods was shown to be 93% or more. The sensitivity and specificity values compare well with those of some PCR-based methods for foodborne pathogen detection Malorny et al., 2004) . The lower sensitivity value of the adenovirus/freshwater may be due to the fact that the HAdV concentration in the seeded sample was lower than the NoV concentration used. This may also explain the higher COR values for the HAdV-positive marine and freshwater samples. Furthermore, it should be noted that the samples used for the QC were not actually identical, whereas for the COR estimation this would be preferred. Each participant used the water from their own site(s), and this would differ from site to site and from week to week. River water, particularly, will contain varying levels of material that may reduce the effectiveness of the concentration method and/or inhibit the molecular assays. Notwithstanding this, the results demonstrate that the methods used are robust, although currently no criteria exist on lower limits of acceptability for robustness of methods for detection of viruses in water.",

There were thus 10 virus equivalents in 100 mL nucleic acid extract, and on the assumption that this extract was obtained from 5 mL concentrate with no loss of target nucleic acid, this implies that there were 20 virus particles in the 10 mL concentrate. Assuming that the concentrate was derived from the original sample with no loss of virus, the conclusion is that a signal from the neat extract indicates that there were at least 20 virus particles in the 10-L water sample.

The amount of sewage discharged in the vicinity of many of the sites studied will affect the likelihood of human viruses being present in the water.

In the current study the norovirus RT-PCR suffered about 5.5% of reactions failing to give a conclusive result (4.4% of freshwater samples and 7.7% of marine samples). Samples were tested at a higher dilution (up to 10 \u00c03 ) to remove inhibition and achieve a positive IAC signal. Successive dilutions were done when a higher concentration failed to give a target signal or an IAC signal. Inhibition of the adenovirus PCR was much less problematic, with PCR reactions of 0.9% of freshwater samples and 5.6% of marine water samples being inhibited. Samples from one inland major river site (Kew Bridge, UK) had often to be diluted up to 10 \u00c03 and consequently unexpectedly low numbers of samples positive for adenovirus (23%) were recorded.

However, use of an adenovirus PCR, for example, as a means of determining recreational water quality would require the use of quantitative, rather than presence/absence detection. Quantitative PCRs for different types of environmental adenovirus are now available. Whether such a test would detect infectious virus may be addressed by, for example, detection of virus-specific mRNA, and also there is some evidence that in adenovirus preparations from which free DNA has been removed before analysis virus titres measured by infectivity and by QPCR are very similar (Giron\u00e8 s, personal communication).
