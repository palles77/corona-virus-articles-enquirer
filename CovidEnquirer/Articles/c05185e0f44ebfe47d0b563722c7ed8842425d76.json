Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, China has constructed a primary network of high-level biosafety laboratories at different levels and established an expert team on LB. Furthermore, a series of LB management documents, including laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines, have been developed and published. This gradually maturing LB system has played a pivotal role in emerging infectious disease control and prevention, as well as in research, which in turn contributes to public health. In recent years, international collaboration between China and other countries has also been accelerated. Despite these achievements, we are still facing many challenges and opportunities in the field of LB. Sustainable LB development requires the joint efforts of the entire society and continuous international cooperation to safeguard global public health.",

In the early 1990s, as the director of the Technical Guidance Office of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, I participated in the accreditation of the first batch of biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories for HIV research in China. In the meantime, I held a concurrent position in the Infectious Disease Supervision and Management Office of the Ministry of Health of China. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, as a deputy leader of the Field Supervision Group, I was entrusted with the mission at the critical and tough moment to fight against this significant pathogen along with my colleagues. I would like to use the word \"dedication\" to describe the generation of experts who initiated the laboratory biosafety (LB) project in China. After an incident of laboratory exposure of SARS-CoV in 2004, I was asked to set up the first Office of Laboratory Management of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). The core responsibility of this office was to establish and improve the LB management system of the China CDC. A series of our pioneering efforts have changed the scattered and disordered condition of laboratories into a comprehensive, centralized, standardized, and scientific LB management system in the China CDC, and later, all over the country. Since then, under the supervision of the Chinese Government and through the joint efforts of experts from different institutions, China has made great achievements in LB.",

Since then, China has made remarkable advancements in the development of high-level biosafety laboratories and supervision systems for these laboratories, as well as corresponding international collaborations [1] . Currently, China has raised biological safety and security, of which LB is a crucial part, to the height of national strategy.",

As China's first BSL-4 laboratory put into operation, Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory conducts studies on highly pathogenic viruses. Since January 2018, the laboratory has been in operation for global scientists who wish to conduct scientific experiments on BSL-4 pathogens. In the near future, Wuhan BSL-4 Laboratory will serve as the national research and development center for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, the culture collection center of microorganism and viruses and a WHO reference Laboratory for Infectious Diseases [2] .

Samples previously preserved by provincial research institutions and medical institutions were transferred to designated national institutions for storage [3] . In 2013, the National Health and Family Planning Commission issued a plan for the construction of collection centers for human-borne pathogenic microorganisms and viruses (2013-2018). This plan encompasses six national-level culture collection centers, 27 laboratories, and at least one provincial culture collection center for each province. To date, accreditation has been completed for all of the six national-level culture collection centers. In addition, to integrate national expert teams and technical forces, the Biological Resource Management and Utilization Branch of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association was established in 2018 with the objective of promoting the development of biological resources.",

In 2008, the China CDC published a video titled \"LB of Pathogenic Microorganisms,\" which was used for large-scale video training at various disease control institutions in China. Laboratory staffs were required to take training annually at their own institutions to ensure that they were competent to perform LB-related work.
