In the present study, in-depth phylogenetic and Bayesian phylogeographic studies were conducted to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of AvCoVs detected in wild and synanthropic birds. A total of 500 samples, including tracheal and cloacal swabs collected from 312 wild birds belonging to 42 species, were analysed using molecular assays. A total of 65 samples (13%) from 22 bird species were positive for AvCoV. Molecular evolution analyses revealed that the sequences from samples collected in Brazil did not cluster with any of the AvCoV S1 gene sequences deposited in the GenBank database. Bayesian framework analysis estimated an AvCoV strain from Sweden (1999) as the most recent common ancestor of the AvCoVs detected in this study. Furthermore, the analysis inferred an increase in the AvCoV dynamic demographic population in different wild and synanthropic bird species, suggesting that birds may be potential new hosts responsible for spreading this virus.",

The evolutionary dynamics of AvCoVs are characterised by the continuous emergence of new variants, resulting in multiple serotypes that do not confer cross-protective immunity to each other (Jackwood et al., 2012) . AvCoV diversity is mainly driven by three factors: the elevated mutation rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; the great diversity of birds, which provides many potential target hosts for different AvCoV genotypes; and the facilitation of viral transmission and dissemination across large geographic areas and between different species by bird migration and flock lifestyles (Keesing et al., 2010) . These factors have driven the generation of a wide http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.03.002 0168-1702/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In other words, the BBM analyses inferred two, three and four dispersal events involving countries on different continents (North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia) (Fig. 7) . BBM analyses of the ancestral ranges of AvCoV strains from wild and synanthropic birds (highlighted with blue traces) revealed that most strains had only Brazilian identity. However, ancestral nodes 109 (A and R) and 111 (A and D) had a biogeographic ancestrality range from other countries. Data from the MCC trees showed that an AIBV strain from Sweden detected in chickens was the nearest ancestor; based on Node 111, the ancestrality frequency was 0.84% (AD), 0.19% (D), and 0.64% (from another ancestor range) (Fig. 7) .

Use of the coalescent parameter from the exponential population growth model to observe the direction of viral transmissibility using the MCC tree approach (chicken (n = 1) to pigeon (n = 12) to wild birds (n = 32)) enabled an estimation of a coherent epidemiological trace for interspecies AvCoV transmission (Fig. 8B) .",
