            "text": "Background: The regulatory IL-10 and TGF-$1 cytokine gene polymorphisms have been associated with allergic diseases in different populations, like Caucasian, Chinese and Indians. However, no associations between IL-10 and TGF-$1 gene polymorphisms and food allergy (FA) in Japanese children have been evaluated so far. To clarify the relationship of polymorphisms of these 2 regulatory cytokine genes with FA, not atopy itself, polymorphisms IL-10 AV1082G, CV819T and TGF-$1 T+869C, G+915C, CV509T in FA patients were compared with those in non-FA atopic controls. Methods: One hundred-eleven childhood FA patients, with a mean 7.6T4.0 years of age and 115 atopic control children without FA (mean = 8.2T1.5 years of age) were recruited. Most of FA patients and atopic controls were sensitized with house dust mite (92% and 93%, respectively). DNA samples from these subjects were genotyped by using Real Time PCR. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of IL-10 V1082 AA genotype was 2.5 (95%CI, 1.0Y6.4) for food allergy risk when compared with atopic control subjects (p = 0.03). This study had a power of 80% to achieve significance at the 0.05 level for IL-10 V1082A allele when OR is greater than 2.3. Our OR value was 2.4; therefore, we consider this association had enough statistical power to support our finding. There were no significative differences in the frequency of IL-10 CV819T and TGF-$1 gene polymorphisms between both groups. Conclusion: This result indicates that IL-10 AV1082G gene polymorphism is associated with food allergy susceptibility in atopic Japanese children. Our findings should encourage further studies to elucidate the functional relationship of IL-10 AV1082G gene polymorphism in FA pathogenesis.",

IgE reactivity of choline oxidase protein was assessed with atopic patients`sera. Acute toxicity of choline oxidase protein was also assessed in mice model. Results: Choline oxidase protein was stable at 90-C for 1 hour and reacted with choline oxidase antibodies on immunoblot. Specific IgE levels were low in choline oxidase treated mice comparable to control, while OVA sensitized mice showed high IgE levels. Intravenous challenge with choline oxidase did not induce any adverse reaction but i.v challenge with OVA led to anaphylaxis in OVA sensitized mice. Choline oxidase sensitized mice demonstrated IL-4 release similar to control in splenic culture supernatant however, OVA sensitized mice showed higher IL-4 levels. Histological analysis of lung tissues from choline oxidase sensitized mice showed intact epithelium with normal airways, whereas OVA sensitized mice showed narrowing of airways with increased eosinophilic infiltration. ELISA with allergic patients`sera (n=45) revealed low specific IgE binding (mean OD 0.281) with choline oxidase protein. Acute toxicity studies of choline oxidase protein in mice model showed no significant difference (p90.05) with control in growth, body weight, food consumption and blood biochemical indices. Histopathology of gut tissues of mice fed with choline oxidase showed normal gastric mucosa lining with normal villi in jejunum and ileum sections. Conclusion: Bacterial choline oxidase protein is heat stable but failed to elicit allergic response in mice model. These data indicates choline oxidase protein may be safe for use in transgenic crops. 4 Identification of amino acids critical for IgE-binding to sequential epitopes of bovine 0-casein and the similarity of these epitopes to the corresponding human 0-casein sequence 9 Abstract withdrawn 10 CXC and CC chemokines produced by human respiratory epithelium Ilja Striz 1 , Eliska Krasna 1 , Libor Kolesar 1 , Antonij Slavcev 1 , Marcela Jaresova 1 , and Jaromir Musil 2 . 1 Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Department of Immunology, Prague, Czech Republic; 2 University Hospital Motol, Pulmonary Department, Prague, Czech Republic. :",

Cells stimulated with IL-1 beta or TNF alpha upregulated mRNA expression of chemokines specific for mononuclear cells recruitment such as CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL4 (MIP 1 beta), CCL5 (RANTES), and CCL20 (MIP 3 alpha). For the induction of of CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11 (I-TAC) which attract activated T lymphocytes, IFN gamma was the most potent stimulus. The induction of epithelial cells by IL-1 related cytokines, IL-33 and IL-18, resulted only in a moderate upregulation of few CC or CXC chemokines compared to a potent effect of IL-1 beta stimulation. Epithelium derived chemokines such as CXCL5, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 or CCL5 are abundant in BAL fluids but can be only rarely detected in EBC. We conclude from our data that respiratory epithelial cells are involved in regulating the influx of different populations of inflammatory cells by release of multiple CC and CXC chemokines in a highly coordinated manner. diarrhea are, protein-losing gastroenteropathies. Intestinal lymphangiectasia (InL) . Is a rare entity which can be congenital or acquired it is characterized by abnormal, dilated lymphatics throughout the intestinal tract. The disorder leads to leakage of lymph causing hypoproteinemia, lymphopenia and hypogamaglobulinemia, which can leads to depression of both the humoral and cellular immune systems. Case Report: A 35 year old woman from rural Mexico with a history of asthma for 20 years, presented with a chief complaint of diarrhea for 15 months with up to 10 evacuations a day, she referred colic pain with abdominal distension and flatulence with recurrent symmetrical systemic edema. The patient showed fatigue, weaknesses and muscle spasms as well as myalgias and fasciculations, she lost 22 lbs and developed onychomycosis in all of her toenails. She recalls showing the same clinical signs and symptoms once during childhood. Her medical team did not have a clear diagnosis. Laboratory revealed a lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypocalcemia and negative HIV by ELISA. The stool \u00dc 1-antitrypsin level was elevated. The CT of chest and abdomen was normal. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed showing gastritis, a duodenal biopsy demonstrates dilated lymphatics and white villi spots. Discussion: The lack of elevated levels of protein in the urine along with the depressed serum levels of IgG drew attention to the gastrointestinal tract as the likely portal of protein loss. Detecting an elevated level of \"1-antitrypsin in a 24-hour stool collection adds support to the diagnosis of InL. A duodenal biopsy with the characteristic histological findings, demonstrating dilated lymphatics and white spots, confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment of primary InL is symptomatic and only marginally effective. We treat our patient with strict dietary lipid restrictions, pancreatic enzymes, probiotics, diuretics, Mediumchain triglycerides and multivitamins. The patient showed a marked response regained her normal weight, but the diarrhea and edema sporadically presents. To date is the seventh reported case of primary InL in Mexico and to our knowledge the only described in literature of biphasic presentation.",

            "text": "The natriuretic peptides (NP) are key endogenous factors that control inflammation and immune tolerance, the latter is essential to maintain immune homeostasis, control autoreactive T cells, prevent the onset of autoimmune diseases and achieve tolerance of transplants. The mechanism of regulation of ANP-NPRA signaling in DCs is crucial for the understanding of how ANP regulates innate immunity and how failure of this signaling might contribute to autoimmune disease, chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Herein, the role of the c-terminal NP, ANP and one tolerance inducing NP, NP73-102, in modulating DC function was examined. The results demonstrate that in contrast to ANP, NP73-102 primes DCs to induce regulatory T (Treg) cells. The ANP receptor, NPRA, binds to TLR-2, SOCS3 and STAT3 and affects induction of IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-!, not IL-17. SOCS3 expression is controlled in a MyD88-dependent manner. Also, down-regulation of SOCS3 and TLR2, but not STAT3, affects NPRA expression. These results demonstrate that TLR2, and SOCS3 are key players in integrating ANP-NPRA signaling with innate immunity and provide insight into how inhibition of IRNP affects ANP-NPRA signaling promoting the tolerogenic phenotype of DCs. Thus, we found a tendency towards the prevalence of ever having got an asthma diagnosis, and having current asthma being slightly more common in 2003 compared to 10 years earlier. However, using asthma medication had increased and suffering from asthma symptoms had decreased. Furthermore, self-reported allergy had increased, especially towards furry pets. Discussion: The study population was not a representative sample of the Swedish adult population, and one should be cautious when generalizing from the results. However, apart from gender, school employees should not differ substantially from the general working population. Furthermore, the two study populations were very homogenous to each other, with respect to gender, age, occupation and geographical habitat, and the study methods were identical. Conclusion: The results imply a small increase of asthma and allergy during the 10-year period 1993Y2003 in Swedish adults.",

Background: Despite asthma control and treatment adherence have been largely investigated in current literature, the appropriateness of general practitioner in prescribing for patients with asthma is less studied. At the beginning of a continuing professional development (CPD) program on rhinitis and asthma, part of ARGA (Allergopatie Respiratorie studio di monitoraggio linee-guida GINA e ARIA), a study supported by Italian Drug Agency (AIFA), the drugs prescription and the healthcare resource utilization of physicians adhering to the study were performed. Materials and Methods: We observed 70.147 patients followed by 60 GP during 2006. 709 patients had diagnosis of asthma. 68 patients were hospitalized for asthma exacerbations, mean age 51 yrs. Among these patients only 16 were treated with association of beta 2 agonist/inhaled steroid coupled with antileukotrienes (9/16), antihistamines (8/16), theophylline (4/16) . Systemic steroids (prednisone, betamethasone) were prescribed to 10 patients, among them, 3 received no other therapy, other 3 patients received only oral antihistamines. In 4/16 patients were prescribed tiotropium although asthma indication is not approved. The total amount of prescribed asthma drugs for these patients was low, it could last for a maximum of two months. The most prescribed drugs were beta 2 short acting bronchodilators (up to 22 drug boxes for a patient). No patient was evaluated by a specialist (allergist or pneumonologist) before hospitalization; only 6 were visited by a specialist after their discharge from the hospital and 11 underwent a spirometric evaluation. 7 patients were hospitalized twice in a year. Conclusion: Regardless of the efforts of national and international societies for the diffusion of asthma diagnosis and treatment guidelines, asthma is still undervalued and untreated by general practitioners; this could be the principal cause of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation in the observed group of patients. It could be interesting to evaluate in a CPD blended program (5 residential plus 4 distance learning courses) in which the contents are tailored on physicians knowledge, which healthcare resource utilisation and drugs prescription would be able to improve the asthma management.",

The twodimensional IgE-binding spectrum of C. japonica pollen allergens demonstrated that many allergens remain to be identified. Here we present the molecular cloning and immunochemical characterization of a novel C. japonica pollen allergen belonging to aspartyl protease family. Methods: TOF-MS analysis of a high IgE-binding protein, termed CPA63, revealed its internal amino acid sequences. Based on these sequence information, cDNA-encoding CPA63 was cloned by RACE-PCR. The allergen was produced as a recombinant protein using baculovirus-insect cell culture system, and purified by double chromatographic technique using HisTrap and HiTrap Q columns. Putative mature recombinant CPA63 (r-CPA63) was produced upon autolysis by incubation in acetate buffer (pH 3.3) , and used for ELISA experiment. Its proteolytic activity was tested using FITC-casein as a substrate at different pHs, and substrate specificity was evaluated by using series of protease inhibitors. Results: CPA63 cDNA encoded a 472 amino acid polypeptide with calculated molecular weight and isoelectric point of 51.1 kDa and 4.69, respectively. Homology search revealed that CPA63 polypeptide sequence showed about 40% identity with plant aspartyl protease/nucleoid DNA binding protein family members. ELISA demonstrated that purified r-CPA63 was recognized by pollinosis patient IgE at a frequency of 58% (18/31). The r-CPA63 also showed an aspartyl protease-like proteolytic activity, demonstrating its enzymatic maturation upon autolysis. Conclusion: CPA63 is the first plant aspartyl protease identified as an allergen.",

Background: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by recurrent skin swelling, abdominal pain attacks, and potentially life-threatening upper airway obstruction. The classic HAE types (I and II) are caused by mutations in the complement C1 inhibitor gene, resulting in a quantitatve or qualitative deficiency of C1 inhibitor. In contrast, in a novel HAE type, affecting mainly women, C1 inhibitor concentration and activity in plasma are normal (HAE type III, HAE with normal C1 inhibitor); we hypothesized that an abnormal coagulation factor XII molecule may lead to inappropriate activation of the kinin-forming cascade and, therefore, performed a search for mutations in the F12 gene. Methods: Twenty unrelated index patients from families with hereditary angioedema and normal C1 inhibitor activity were screened for mutations in the coagulation factor XII gene by sequencing of the 14 exons and splice junctions of the F12 gene; subsequently, beside 235 control individuals, another six such index patients as well as 90 patients with idiopathic angioedema were selectively sequenced for exon 9 of the F12 gene. Results: Two different non-conservative missense mutations, both located in exactly the same position within exon 9, namely in the second position of the codon (ACG) encoding Thr309 of the mature protein, were identified. Five of the twenty patients screened showed a heterozygous CYA transversion (1032CYA), predicting a threonine-to-lysine substitution (Thr309Lys); one additional patient showed a heterozygous CYG transversion (1032CYG), resulting in a threonine-to-arginine substitution (Thr309Arg). Sequencing of exon 9 in another six index patients revealed one further patient heterozygous for the Thr309Lys mutation. Thus, in 7 of 26 unrelated patients the wild-type threonine is substituted by a basic amino acid residue. The mutations were not found in healthy control individuals (n = 235) and co-segregated with the phenotype in seven families with altogether 23 affected women, providing strong support that they cause disease. Finally, the Thr309Lys mutation was also identified in 2 out of 90 patients with idiopathic angioedema; thus, this mutation may also play a role in a subgroup of these singular angioedema cases with no affected family members. Conclusion: These findings provide strong support that the coagulation factor XII gene is a new angioedema gene.",

The highly potent, specific plasma kallikrein inhibitor, DX-88 (ecallantide) has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of HAE. Methods: Patients 10 years of age or older with documented HAE (12 naBve patients and 48 patients who were treated for a single acute HAE attack in the double-blind, placebo-controlled stage of EDEMA3) participated in this openlabel extension. Patients were given 30 mg DX-88 to treat acute HAE attacks at all anatomic site locations-abdominal, peripheral, and laryngeal. Outcome measures at 4 and 24 hours were the HAE-specific Treatment Outcome Score (TOS) and change from baseline in Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score. TOS and MSCS are composite scores measuring all attack sites. Time to onset of response and time to significant improvement in overall response were recorded. Safety was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Results: Interim data are presented for 59 patients treated for 145 acute HAE attacks (20 men, 39 women, median age 34.0 years, range 12Y77 years). Mean TOS was 75.3 T 39.64 at 4 hours and 81.8 T 36.55 at 24 hours (Q 50= improvement). Mean MSCS change from baseline was j2.3 T 0.6 at both 4 and 24 hours (j1 to j3 = clinically-significant improvement). Median time to onset of overall improvement was 37.5 minutes, and time to onset of significant overall improvement was 165.0 minutes. Safety data for 51 patients included 166 TEAEs (87% mild or moderate in severity and 89% resolved without sequelae), with 30 related TEAEs in 15 patients. Related events experienced by more than 1 patient include diarrhea, nausea, injection site reaction (3 patients each) , HAE, myalgia, headache, cough, and pruritus (2 patients each). A total of 7 SAEs occurred in 7 patients; 6 were unrelated to DX-88, and 1 SAE of anaphylactic reaction reported previously, was assessed as related, and resolved without sequelae. Conclusion: Repeat dosing of DX-88 (ecallantide) for acute HAE attacks resulted in onset of overall improvement in G40 minutes and significant overall improvement in G3 hours. Ecallantide was generally well tolerated with the majority of adverse events being mild or moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae.",

It was characterized by recurrent bouts of angioedema in various organs and normal C1 inhibitor and was observed mainly in women. Our aim was to conduct a detailed study of the clinical features of this condition. Methods: A total of 138 patients with hereditary angioedema and normal C1 inhibitor who belonged to 43 unrelated families were examined through the use of standardized questionnaires. Results: A majority of patients with hereditary angioedema and normal C1 inhibitor had skin swellings (92.8%), tongue swellings (53.6%), and abdominal pain attacks (50%). Laryngeal edema (25.4%) and uvular edema (21.7%) also were frequent, whereas edema episodes of other organs were rare (3.6%) . Facial swellings and tongue involvement occurred considerably more frequently compared with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency. The number of patients with recurrent edema of only one organ was higher than in classic hereditary angioedema. The number of patients with disease onset in adulthood was significantly higher in hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor compared with classic hereditary angioedema. Erythema marginatum was not observed. A subgroup of patients from families with coagulation factor XII mutations showed the same symptoms as the other patients. Long-term treatment consisted in tranexamic acid and attenuated androgens. Conclusion: Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor levels shows a characteristic pattern of clinical symptoms. The main clinical features include skin swellings, tongue swellings, and abdominal pain attacks.

Clinica Medica 1 -University of Padova, Medical and Surgical Sciences Department, Padova, Italy. Background: Pseudoallergic reactions (PAR) to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are very common in chronic urticaria (CU), as aspirin and related drugs impair symptoms in about 20Y30 % of patients. Moreover, a group of otherwise normal subjects who develop urticaria and/or angioedema (UA) only after the intake of NSAIDs also exists. Although the inhibition of cyclo-oxigenase (COX) pathway seems to play a central role in NSAIDintolerance, a very high prevalence of skin reactivity to autologous serum (AS) has also been reported in NSAID-induced UA, pointing to a possible involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of these forms. Methods: 50 patients who had experienced NSAID-induced UA were recruited and gave their informed consent. 28 had a history of CU exacerbated by NSAIDs, whereas the remaining 22 reported acute UA after NSAIDs intake. In 26 cases, UA had been elicited by a single NSAID, whilst 24 patients signalled adverse skin reactions to two or more COX-inhibitors. None of the patients presented nasal polyps, nor had evidence of asthma or sinusitis. Oral tolerance tests were conducted on different days by single-blind, placebo controlled challenge with increasing amounts of both conventional (nimesulide, 100 mg whole dose; meloxicam, 15 mg), and highly selective (celecoxib, 400 mg; eterocoxib, 90 mg) COX-inhibitors. The test was continued until the whole dose was reached, or UA appeared. Furthermore, skin reactivity to AS was assessed in all subjects in basal conditions, as well as whenever challengeinduced adverse reactions occurred. Results: No patients developed skin symptoms on the placebo day, and 28 tolerated each of the four COX-inhibitors. 16 experienced UA with nimesulide, 8 with meloxicam, 4 with celecoxib and 2 with eterocoxib. Only 4 patients with CU showed a positive cutaneous response to AS, whilst in the other subjects skin tests with both basal serum and samples collected during challenge-induced UA always elicited negative results. Conclusion: Our findings confirm that highly selective COX-inhibitors represent the safest anti-inflammatory drugs in NSAID-induced UA, although it is well known that coxib intake is not recommended in subjects with renal or cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, these results strengthen the concept that cutaneous reactivity to AS is almost exclusively confined to chronic urticaria, and that autoimmunity is not involved in the pathogenesis of NSAID-induced PAR.",

Exposure to gum arabic has been reported to cause occasional cases of occupational asthma, but ingestion of it does not commonly cause immediate allergic symptoms. Methods: In 2005 workers of a candy factory were examined for suspected occupational allergy. Hard boiled candies were covered with spray dried gum arabic in rotating drums, where the workers poured the gum arabic powder. 7/11 had respiratory and skin symptoms and 4 had skin symptoms. Spirometry, histamine challenge test, exhaled breath NO and PEF measurements, skin prick tests (SPT), gum arabic IgE measurements and cutaneous or bronchial challenge tests with gum arabic were carried out. Patch tests were carried out to a patient with eczematous skin disease. In addition, SPT data from 2997 subjects examined for food allergy symptoms from 1998 to 2006 were evaluated. Subjects with positive SPT to gum arabic received a postal questionnaire. Results: Four workers had occupational asthma caused by gum arabic. All of them had a positive SPT with gum arabic and specific IgE to gum arabic (0.60-5.6 kU/l). Three patients had a positive bronchial challenge test with gum arabic and one of them had a positive skin challenge test. One patient had significant PEF decrease when exposed to gum arabic at work, a positive skin challenge and immediate oral symptoms associated with ingested gum arabic. None of them had other significant allergies. One worker had contact dermatitis caused by thiuram chemicals and another with positive SPT to house dust mites had work related allergy to carmine red used in candies. Five workers had no occupational disease. Of patients tested for food allergies 17/2997 (0,005%) had positive SPT to gum arabic and most of them also had positive SPT to pollen and foods. 11/17 (65%) returned the questionnaire. At the time of skin testing gum arabic associated allergic symptoms were suspected in three, and two reported gum arabic ingestion associated oral symptoms in the questionnaire. One gum arabic SPT positive patient without respiratory symptoms had an occupational history of work in a candy factory for years ago. Conclusion: Occupational allergy caused by IgE mediated allergy to gum arabic is a risk in exposure occupations. Ingested gum arabic causes symptoms in few patients.",

Red Cross War Memorial Childrens Hospital, Allergy Clinic, Cape Town, South Africa. Background: IgE levels are usually elevated in allergic diseases, being highest in atopic eczema, followed by atopic asthma and allergic rhinitis. Genetic factors are believed to play a role in total IgE levels, with higher levels seen in Black African subjects. Total IgE is also raised in parasite infection. Thus, the higher total IgE levels in Black Africans could be due to environmental rather than genetic factors. Few studies investigate the usefulness of total IgE levels in the assessment of atopy in Black Africans. Aim: The objective of this study was to determine the total IgE levels in unselected urban Black African high school children and to correlate this with atopy and ascaris sensitization. Methods: Two hundred and twenty Urban Xhosa children (mean age 17 years) attending a school in Cape Town were studied. Atopic status was assessed by means of specific allergen sensitization (ALK\\ skin prick tests to 8 inhalant and 4 food allergens), self reported asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness measured by methacholine challenge. Total IgE and Ascaris specific IgE were measured by CAP-RAST (Pharmacia). Total IgE levels were subanalysed according to atopic status and ascaris sensitisation in order to establish ranges of total IgE in atopic subjects, ascaris sensitised subjects, and non-atopic, non ascaris sensitised subjects. Results: Total IgE levels were markedly skewed toward the left and were not distributed in a Gaussian or a log-normal distribution. Mean total IgE was 307.7 kU/L. The median was 106 kU/l and the interquartile range 50.4 kU/l to 288 kU/l. Skin prick tests were positive for aeroallergens in 32.3 % of subjects. Thirty four percent had elevated ascaris IgE. Total IgE was higher in atopic versus non-atopic subjects and correlated with the number of positive skin prick tests (Kruskall Wallis ANOVAR p G0.0001), self reported asthma (p = 0.025) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (p = 0.0002). In addition total IgE correlated with ascaris IgE (p G0.0001). Subjects with no ascaris sensitisation had median total IgE of 77.1 kU/l, similar to the levels seen in people of other genetic origins.",

Data regarding allergic diseases (asthma, rhinitis and eczema) were collected by a standard questionnaire given to the parent or guardian. Screening for helminth infections was done by examining their fresh stool samples by modified Kato-Katz technique. Serum tIgE was measured by Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay in 67 geohelminth-positive subjects and in a comparable group of geohelminth-negative subjects. Results: The mean age in the study population was 10 years (SDT0.3). The prevalence of geohelminth infection was 15.5%. Trichuris trichiura (14.3%) was the most common followed by Ascaris lumbricoides (4.2%) and hookworm (0.2%). Mixed infection was detected in 20.3% of infected children. Infection intensity was light in 68.9% of infected children while 28.4% and 2.7% showed moderate and heavy infection respectively. The cumulative prevalence of allergic diseases was 33.7%. Prevalence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema was 17%, 21.4% and 5% respectively. Serum tIgE concentrations showed a positively skewed distribution. Geometric mean (GM) for tIgE for the geohelminth infected group (1039.9kU/L) was significantly higher than that of the non-infected group (575.4kU/L) (p = 0.004). It was also higher in the allergic group (933.3kU/L) than in the non-allergic group (639.7kU/L) but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.068). The GM for tIgE for non-allergic children in the study population was much higher than that seen in non-allergic children in developed countries. Conclusion: Serum tIgE concentration was strongly associated with the presence of geohelminth infections in children. Serum tIgE may not be a useful marker for allergic diseases in children living in areas endemic for geohelminth infections.",

Background: Adenoid and tonsil have been considered as immune organs. They may present different cellular and cytokine profiles according to the atopic status. The objective of this study was to find the status of eosinophil activation and compare between atopic and non-atopic children. Materials and Methods: Adenoid and tonsil tissues obtained from 40 children (18 atopics and 22 non-atopics) were enrolled. Seven atopic and 9 non-atopic children had chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and/or otitis media with effusion (OME). Atopic status was classified as a positive result ( 92+) on MAST test to common inhalant allergens. Serum total IgE and eosinophil count were measured. ECP level and cellular activation markers, including sCD23, sIL-2R and IL-6 within the supernatant of adenoid and tonsil tissue were measured by CAP system (Pharmacia, Sweden) or ELISA. Results: The ECP level in adenoid and tonsil tissue from atopic children was 451.06g/L, 514.26g/L, which were significantly higher than those from nonatopic children (353.2 6g/L, 374.4 6g/L, respectively). The ECP level in adenoid and tonsil tissues from atopic children with CRS showed the highest (564.6 6g/L and 718.1 6g/L), followed by those from non-atopic children with CRS (449.3 6g/L and 430.7 6g/L), those from atopic children without CRS (371.5 6g/L and 371.6 6g/L), and those from non-atopic children without CRS (291.5 6g/L and 338.2 6g/L). And the ECP level in adenoid were significantly correlated with locally produced total IgE and cellular activation markers, including sCD23, sIL-2R and IL-6. Conclusion: This findings suggest that activated eosinophil could be involved in inflammatory response occurring in the adenoid and tonsil from both atopic and non-atopic children. The more activated eosinophils, the more CRS can be combined. The activation of T cell, especially Th2 cell could lead to the activation of eosinophil in adenoid and tonsil tissues.",

Wong 1 . 1 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Department of Paediatrics, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; 2 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Department of Chemical Pathology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Background: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene encoding plant homeodomain finger protein (PHF11) were shown by positional cloning to be associated with severe asthma and elevated circulating total IgE level in Caucasians. These SNPs were also associated with childhood atopic dermatitis. Such genetic association has not been studied in Chinese. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between PHF11 SNPs and asthma phenotypes in Chinese children. Methods: 269 asthmatics and 165 non-allergic children were recruited from our paediatric clinics. Their lung function was assessed by spirometry, and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels were measured online by chemiluminescence analyser at expiratory flow rate of 50 ml/s. Plasma total and specific IgE were quantified by immunoassays. Ten SNPs in PHF11 were genotyped by multiplex SNaPshoti reaction with an ABI-310 Genetic Analyser. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern of these SNPs was analysed by Haploview, and the association between asthma traits and PHF11 was analysed by multivariate regression. Results: The mean (SD) log-transformed plasma total IgE and FeNO levels in cases and controls were 2.62 (0.61) and 80.5 (59.2) ppb and 1.81 (0.71) and 40.6 (43.2) ppb, respectively (P G 0.001 for both). All 10 SNPs followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P 9 0.05). There were significant interethnic variations in PHF11 minor alleles (up to 19%) in our children when compared with Caucasians. PHF11 polymorphisms were not associated with asthma diagnosis (P 9 0.5), asthmatics with FEV 1 G 65% of predicted (P 9 0.3), or atopy (P 9 0.09). Multivariate linear regression showed that PHF11 T167A and G491A were associated with plasma total IgE (P = 0.048 and 0.051, respectively); and C507T and C732T were associated with FeNO (P = 0.019 for both). Two haplotype blocks could be constructed -one with T79C, G491A, C507T and T661A (D' 9 0.9) and the other with T395C and C732T (D' = 0.95). Three major haplotypes from these 6 SNPs (CTGA CT [53%], TTAT TT [29%] and TCGT TC [18%]) were identified, but which were not associated with asthma diagnosis (P90.3). Conclusion: Our results suggest that PHF11 polymorphisms are associated with plasma total IgE and FeNO levels but not asthma diagnosis in Chinese children.",

Objective: The aim of this study was to establish the relationship between repiratory syncytial virus and the modifications in immunity that cause appearance of childhood asthma. Patients and Methods: The prospective study Two groups of study: CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIOLITIS. (Group A). The problem group of children was originally made up of 65 children (with an average age of 3 months, 1 day to 7 months) who were admitted to this Hospital for their first episode of VRS positive bronchiolitis, from December 1997 to February 1998. 50 of them completed follow-up for 2 years. In the tests done at the moment of admittance :hemogram, and Ig G, Ig M, Ig A, Ig E, lymphocyte count, eosinophil cationic protein,IL-4 IFN-g. were at 6, 12 and 18 months, At 18 months an adhesion molecules count was requested: sVCAM.1, sLselectin. The second group (group B), was made up of 80 children, sub-divided into 4 groups of 20 according to age: IL-4, IFN-g and adhesion molecules. Results: In the acute stage of the bronchiolitis, the immunological response to the viral infection was anomalous, in that they presented a humoral immunity response (with an increase of immunoglobulins G, A, M, the later with p = 0,014) and a decrease in T, T4 and T8 cellular immunity. The immunolological response to the viral infection must be of cellular predominance, in order to be effective. Among all children suffering from VRS bronchiolitis, we found a statistically significant increase (p = 0,001) of sL-Selectine at 18 months of age in comparison with healthy children of the same age. Conclusion: the characteristic patterns that lead us to believe that a child who suffers from bronchiolitis will develop asthma are: Increase in humoral immunity response at the acute stage of the bronchiolitis Decrease in cellular immunity response, from the acute VRS infection until 6 months of age Increased IL-4 values mainly at 6 and 12 months of age. Decrease in INF-g between 6 and 18 months of age.",

Background: Mast cell chymase is an important mediator of inflammation and remodeling in the asthmatic lung. Various studies examined the association between -1903 G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the mast cell chymase gene (CMA1) and allergic phenotypes with inconsistent results. The (TG)n(GA)m repeat polymorphism 254 bp downstream of the chymase gene was previously found to associate asthma in adults. We sought to investigate the association of the -1903 CMA1 SNP as well as the (TG)n(GA)m repeat polymorphism with childhood asthma and its associated traits in a case-control study aiming to identify local data from our country. Methods: The study comprised 15 children (6Y10 years old) with bronchial asthma and a family history of atopy enrolled consecutively during asthma exacerbation and 15 age and sex matched children with negative personal or family history of allergy as a control group. They were subjected to clinical evaluation and serum total IgE estimation as well as search for polymorphism in the CMA1 gene promoter region 1903 G/A using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism based genotyping (RELP) and the (TG)n(GA)m repeat polymorphism 254 bp downstream of the CMA1 gene. Results: Investigating the -1903 G/A SNP revealed significant difference in the distribution of CMA1 A and G alleles between the patients and controls. Allele G was detected in 70% of patients compared to 16.7% of controls, while allele A was overexpressed in the control group (83.3%). Our data showed for the first time a positive association between -1903 G/A SNP and asthma. Concerning the (TG)n(GA)m repeat, a significant difference was obtained in the allele counts among patients and controls in the current study. The largest difference was observed in allele 39 which was only represented in the asthmatic children and allele 37 which was overexpressed among the controls. A positive association for the allele 39 of the (TG)n(GA)m repeat with serum IgE levels was also detected in our series. The findings are limited by the sample size. Conclusion: We report the association of -1903 G/A SNP and (TG)n(GA)m repeat polymorphism downstream of the CMA1 gene with bronchial asthma in a group of Egyptian children. The findings suggest that the alleles, genotypes and haplotypes investigated are possible important determinants of asthma susceptibility and are probably involved in regulating IgE levels in atopic asthma.",

Study Selection: Randomized, placebo-controlled and double blind trials that studied the effects of MFNS in patients with allergic rhinitis. Comprehensive searches of the EMBASE, LILACS, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE databases from 1966 up to January 2007 and references of identified articles and reviews. Outcomes: Different outcomes measured in the active treatment and control groups were considered. Review Manager 4.2.8 Program (Cochrane Collaboration) was used for data synthesis. Outcomes were extracted from original articles. If information was not available, authors of each trial were contacted. Some graphics were digitalized. The analysis included the calculation of standardized mean difference (SMD). There was significant heterogeneity among the study results, because of differing study methodologies. Randomeffects model was used. Results: The initial scanning identified 91 articles, 26 of which were potentially relevant trials on the use of mometasone for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. 14 studies were randomized controlled trials and met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. All randomized clinical trials included 23 comparison groups and more than 20 different outcomes (individual and global). For efficacy assessment, 2163 patients were analyzed; 1113 received mometasone and 1050 placebo.

Background: Cysteinyl leukotrienes are mediators contributing to the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and exerting their effect through specific receptors. We aimed to evaluate the effect of a naturally occurring grass pollen season and the anti-rhinitis treatment on the expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT(1)R) in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients. Methods: In a double-blind randomised study, 59 patients with allergic rhinitis received treatment with either nasal steroid (fluticasone propionate; FP, 200 microg/day), oral antileukotriene montelukast (ML, 10 mg/day) alone or in combination with antihistamine loratadine (LT, 10 mg/day), or placebo over the grass pollen season. Nasal biopsies for immunohistochemical CysLT(1)R analysis were taken before and during the peak of the grass pollen season. Results: The grass pollen season induced a significant increase in the CysLT(1)R expression in placebo (from 0.097 T 0.005 to 0.178 T 0.012 cells/ field), ML (from 0.113 T 0.011 to 0.148 T 0.009), and ML + LT (from 0.122 T 0.008 to 0.154 T 0.016), but not in FP (from 0.123 T 0.013 to 0.128 T 0.016) treated patients. FP treated patients had significantly lower pollen-season induced change in the CysLT(1)R expression compared to other groups. Also, both ML and ML+LT treatment groups had significantly lower increase in the CysLT(1)R expression compared to placebo treatment. Conclusion: We conclude that the inhibitory effect on CysLT(1)R expression is one of the mechanisms by which nasal steroids and antileukotrienes alone or together with antihistamines exert their anti-inflammatory effect in allergic rhinitis with nasal steroids demonstrating the strongest inhibition. separation. The protein signatures of 79 inflammatory mediators from these paired serum samples were analyzed using RayBio\\ Human Cytokine Antibody Array V. Serum levels of leptin, being differentially expressed in umbilical cord blood (UCB) from those with maternal asthma, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by ELISA assays. The respective lower detection limits for these markers were 125 ng/L and 0.1 mg/L. Results: Six pregnant mothers with asthma and 6 non-allergic controls were recruited, with respective mean (SD) age being 30.7 (5.9) years and 35. 1 (4.9) years. Five of 6 UCB samples from newborns with maternal asthma had increased leptin levels when compared with newborns with non-allergic mothers. Other mediators with altered levels in two or more UCB samples with maternal asthma included IL-3, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, PDGF-BB, NAP-2, GRO and MIG. Serum leptin and CRP levels from asthmatic mothers were significantly higher than those in UCB from their newborns (P G 0.001), so were serum CRP levels in non-allergic mothers as compared with their newborns (P G 0.01). Leptin levels showed significant positive correlation with CRP levels (r = 0.712, P G 0.001) in sera from asthmatic mothers. On the other hand, CRP was below the detectable limit in most UCB serum samples. Serum leptin levels in UCB did not differ in those with and without maternal asthma. Background: Cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) are potent inflammatory mediators acting through at least two receptors CysLTR 1 and CysLTR 2 . CysLTR 1 mRNA and protein expression is upregulated in patients with severe asthma phenotypes: frequent severe exacerbations, chronic airflow limitation or steroid-resistant asthma. Changes in the CysLTR 1 promoter might influence its transcriptional activity and therefore might modulate airway inflammation. Aim: Investigate an association of polymorphisms in the CysLTR 1 gene promoter with severe and non-severe asthma phenotype. Methods: The study groups consist of 100 patients with severe asthma, 70 patients with non-severe asthma, diagnosed according to GINA 2005 criteria and 100 healthy subjects. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood leukocytes. Fragments of the CysLTR 1 promoter region were amplified by PCR and sequenced directly.",

Hopkins, Allergy, Baltimore, United States; 2 National Institute of Aging, Immunology, Baltimore, United States; 3 University of Missouri-Columbia, Surgery and Molecular Immunology, Columbia, Missouri, United States; 4 Johns Hopkins University, Allergy, Baltimore, United States. Rationale: Posttranscriptional regulation (PTR) is a key yet ill-defined area of gene expression in T cells. We investigated the PTR of interleukin (IL)-13 and the role the RNA-binding protein HuR plays in this process. HuR associates with adenylate-uridylate-rich elements (ARE) in the 3'untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs, promoting mRNA stability and translation. Methods: IL-13 mRNA decay was monitored in human peripheral bloodderived Th2 cells using the transcriptional inhibitor Actinomycin D. The IL-13 3'UTR was subcloned into a tetracycline (Tet)-off $-globin reporter construct and transiently expressed in the absence or presence of overexpressed HuR in H2 cells. Association of HuR with IL-13 mRNA was detected by immunoprecipitation (IP) of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) and by biotin pull-down. Results: IL-13 mRNA half-life increased in cells treated with PMA and ionomycin compared to unstimulated cells (6.5 T 2.0h vs 1.6 T 0.1h, p G 0.05, n = 3). The decay of the $-globin transcript was faster in cells transfected with pTet-BBB-IL13 compared to those transfected with the ARE-less pTet-BBB (2.1 h vs 11.4 h, p G 0.05, n = 6). Overexpression of HuR increased $-globin mRNA half-life in cells transfected with pTet-BBB-IL13 (22.7 h vs 2.3 h, p G 0.01, n = 4). Enrichment of IL-13 mRNA was detected by PCR following IP of Jurkat cell mRNPs with anti-HuR vs a control antibody. HuR binding to IL-13 3'UTR was confirmed by pull-down assay using biotin-labeled RNA probes spanning the 3'UTR or the coding region of IL-13. Conclusion: PTR plays a relevant role in expression of IL-13. HuRmediated stabilization of IL-13 mRNA could be a relevant therapeutic target in asthma.",

Background and Objective: Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is an important lipid mediator in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic airway inflammation via its receptor CRTH2. The human CRTH2 gene encodes a G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor which is expressed on Th2 cell, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte. The main objective of the study is to investigate the association of CRTH2 promoter polymorphism in patients with aspirin intolerant asthma (AIA). Subjects and Methods: The case control study was performed in three groups of patients, 106 AIA, 115 aspirin tolerant asthma (ATA) and 133 normal controls (NC). Two promoter polymorphism of CRTH2 gene were genotyped by a primer extension method, which was performed with the SNaPshot ddNTP primer extension kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Results: Two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), CRTH2-466T9C and -129 C9A were identified in the promoter region of gene. Among two SNPs, the polymorphism of CRTH2 at positions of -466T9C showed a significant difference in genotype frequency between AIA and ATA; AIA patients showed significantly higher frequency of homozygous TT genotype than combined homozygous CC and heterozygous CT genotype of CRTH2 -466T9C (p = 0.037, multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age and sex, recessive model). The luciferase reporter assay showed that the reporter plasmid carrying the -466C allele showed significantly higher promoter activity than -466T allele in human monocytes cell line (U937) and human mast cell line (HMC-1) (p G 0.001and p G 0.001 respectively). Similarly, the promoter activity of CRTH2 -466C allele cotransfected with GATA-3 was found to be increased dose dependently from the baseline promoter activity in HMC-1 cells.",

In the 3 groups of children, divided on the basis theirs phenotypes: I group (n = 21) IgE associated persistent wheezier, II group (n = 47) nonatopic recurrent wheeze, III (n = 8) viral associated wheeze, RSV infection was responsible for the first attack of wheezing in 98%, 2% has early adenovirus infections in the II group. Family history of asthma and multiple asthmas triggers was performed in 95% in I (bilateral genetic risk was funded in 18%) comparing with 3% from II group. In opposite, many risk-factors in prenatal, peripartal and early neonates period of life in the present of serious another illness, was found in the II group (p G 0,05): oligohydramnion, placentas abruptions and infarct, small for date with extremly LBW 800 T 57g, gigant baby with extremely higher birth weight: 5250 T 50g, low Apgar score and reanimation/adaptation problems after birth. Patients in I group demonstrated higher levels of Neu, Eo, moderate degree of diseases and recurrent wheezing and/or asthma. Severity of the illness, many immune, endocrine, metabolic and genetics deregulations, ly-cytosis and Mo-cytosis were typical for II group. Compliance to ICS was significantly better in the I group. On the basis these data we may indirectly conclude implicate excess type 2 and/or deficient type 1 immune responses in the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis and subsequent asthma development in I group. In contrast, II group had probably higher Th1 immune responses during RSV infections, on the basis maternal and intra-uterine factors, and has more severe disease and had shown higher percentage of immune deregulations. Patients in II group have attributes specific for NAA and complex immunoregulatory pattern followed by inappropriate response to treatment. These results indicate that immunological background via CD8+T cells may play an important role in the regulation of the differentiation and activation of the Th2CD4+Tcells during RSV infection.",

Technical university students in four classrooms participated in a blinded study. Two classrooms had higher air exchange (4.1Y5.2 ac/h); two others had lower air exchange (2.3Y2.6 ac/h). After one week, ventilation conditions were shifted between the rooms. The students reported medical symptoms last hour, on a seven step rating scale. Room temperature, RH, CO2, PM10, and ultra fine particles were measured simultaneously during 1 hour. In addition, illumination, air velocity, operative temperature, supply air temperature, formaldehyde, NO2, O3 and airborne levels of bacteria, moulds and common allergens was measured. Totally 355 students participated at least once in the study during the two weeks , 121 participated twice in the longitudinal analysis. In total, 31% were females, 2.9% were smokers, 3.8% had asthma, 18.1% pollen allergy (hay fever), and 14.0% furry pet allergy. Mean CO2 was 993 ppm (674Y1450 ppm), temperature 22.7 C (20Y25 C), and RH 24% (19Y35 %). Low and high air exchange rate corresponded to a personal outdoor air flow of 7 L/s*p and 10Y13 L/s*p, respectively. Mean PM10 was 20 microgram/m3 at low and 15 microgram/m3 at high ventilation flow. In the crude analysis, ocular, nasal and throat symptoms, dermal symptoms, dyspnea, sinusitis, headache, tiredness and nausea was significantly more common at higher CO2 levels and higher room temperature. At higher air exchange rate dyspnea and dermal symptoms were significantly less common. Similar results were obtained in the multivariate analysis, controlling for potential confounders such as gender, smoking and a history of atopy. In the longitudinal analysis of a subset participating twice, increased temperature was significantly related to increase of tiredness. In conclusion, computer classrooms may have CO2 levels above the current ventilation standards (more than 1000 ppm) and temperatures above 22 C, due to crowdedness and high thermal load. Increased temperature and CO2-levels may affect both dermal and mucosal membrane symptoms, as well as headache and tirdness. It is recommended that the personal ventilation flow is at least 10 L/s.",

Background: Blomia tropicalis (Bt), a predominant house dust mite (HDM) species in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, is a source of multiple allergens causing allergic sensitization among atopic individuals. Isolation and characterization of the allergenicity these Bt allergens are essential to evaluate the clinical relevance of this HDM species. Methods: Eight recombinant Bt allergens were expressed as GST-fusion allergens in E. coli or secreted allergen in P. pastoris while two native Bt allergens were purified by immuno-affinity chromatography. Specific-IgE reactivity of the Bt allergens were determined using 192 Bt-allergic and 85 nonatopic sera. The panel of Bt allergens were likewise used for skin prick test (SPT) in 110 Bt-allergic pediatric patients. The ability of the recombinant and native Blo t 11 allergens to inhibit the IgE-binding activity in Bt extract was determined by absorption studies. Results: Blo t 1, Blo t 3, Blo t 5, Blo t 10, Blo t 11-fD, Blo t 12 and Blo t 19 were expressed as soluble GST-recombinant proteins in E. coli while Blo t 4 was expressed in P. Pastoris. Native Blo t 5 and Blo t 11 were purified from Bt extracts using monoclonal antibodies. Of the 192 Bt-allergic patients`sera tested, 68% and 53% reacted positively to recombinant Blo t 5 and Blo t 11-fD, respectively, while 5-30% IgE reactivity was observed with the other recombinant Bt allergens. Interestingly, the IgE reactivity recombinant Blo t 5 and Blo t 11-fD compares with the IgE reactivity of their native counterparts at 70% and 54%, respectively. SPT results showed comparable results with ELISA. Absorption assays, showed that up to 80% inhibition of IgE reactivity in Bt extract can be obtained with the different Bt allergens. Conclusion: Results obtained from this study suggest the clinical importance of Blomia tropicalis as major source of allergens causing allergic sensitizations in tropical regions. The incorporation of Bt allergens in the panel of diagnostic and immunotherapeutic allergens for HDM allergy are highly recommended.",

Larsen, Charlotte Hejl, Henrik Ipsen, Peter A. Wurtzen, and Niels Johansen. ALK-Abello, Research, Horsholm, Denmark. Background: The Pooideae grasses constitute a large taxonomical subfamily with thousands of species and worldwide occurrence. Extensive homology between amino acid sequences of grass pollen allergens occur, and grass pollen counts are published together due to a large immunochemical similarity between the grass pollen allergens. Objective: Study the immunochemical similarity of grass pollen allergens from different Pooideae species. Methods: Amino acid sequences representing grass pollen allergens were obtained from the Uniprot database. Structural similarity of the group 1 allergens was illustrated by mapping identical amino acids on the surface of the x-ray structure of Phl p 1, PDB: 1N10. A large number (913,000 data points) of grass pollen allergic patients' IgE was measured by Magic Lite solid phase immunoassay to eight Pooideae grass pollen extracts, respectively. IgE to eight Pooideae grass pollen extracts was measured by ADVIA Centaur solid phase immunoassay with or without inhibition by 2 mg Phleum pratense pollen extract. Standard T cell stimulation assays using T cell lines from grass pollen allergic donors were applied to assess T cell cross-reactivity. Results: Sequence alignment of Pooideae grass pollen allergens showed high homology. Mapping of identical amino acids on the surface of the x-ray structure of Phl p 1 clearly showed the presence of identical surface structures large enough to harbor IgE binding epitopes. A high correlation (0.86Y0.98 Spearman rank correlation coefficient) was observed when comparing levels of IgE to Phleum pratense with those of pollen extracts from individual grass species. Phleum pratense pollen extract inhibited IgE to other grass species more than 95% in most patients. T cell lines specific for Phl p 1 and Phl p 5 both showed similar stimulation indices when stimulated with different grass pollen extracts indicating extensive T cell cross-reactivity between individual grass species. Conclusion: Phleum pratense alone covers most of the immunochemical reactivity of all tested Pooideae grass species with respect to allergic patients' IgE. T cell lines specific for the group 1 and 5 major allergens showed extensive cross-reactivity between grass species. One specie alone, e.g. Phleum pratense, therefore seems adequate for specific management of allergy to Pooideae grass pollens.",

            "text": "Aeroallergens cause serious allergic and asthmatic reactions. We have been analyzing the Aeroallergen data of the Texas Panhandle region for the last 7 years. We determined the aeroallergen index regularly by analyzing the coated Melinex tape from the Burkard Volumetric Spore Trap. Samples were examined, counted and photographed every 24 hours using a BX-40 Olympus microscope with a DP-70 Olympus Digital Camera. Data were correlated with daily temperature, precipitation, peak wind speed and clinical studies established from Allergy A.R.T.S. Clinical Research Laboratory in an effort to aid in diagnosis of mold and pollen-related allergies. Aeroallergens that we recorded were Alaternaria conidia, Pezizales ascospores, Curvularia, Cladosporium, Dreschlera, Stachybotrysand pollen from short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), grass (Poaceae), hairy sunflower (Helianthus hirsutus), buffalo bur (Solanum rostratum), purple nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium) and lamb`s quarters (Chenopodium album). Due to severe drought conditions in the previous years (2002Y5), the pollen concentration was significantly low, that reached the highest peak from April onwards this year (2007) with plenty of rainfall. We observed this pick from April to July in last year 2006. We noticed a gradual shift in the aeroallergen index in the Texas Panhandle in recent years. Global warming with increased CO2 concentration exerted widespread impacts on the biotic system. Many regions are currently experiencing warming effect associated with global climate change including longer growing seasons and early arrival of spring. Short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) released 54.8% more pollen with an ambient CO2 release (Rogers et al, 2006) . In Japan a 21-year study showed a gradual shift in Cryptomeria japonica pollen season. These results support the steadily increasing number of reports indicating a global warming trend. The temperature change affecting the start dates of the C. japonica pollen season is particularly relevant in the context of human health. From the clinical data from the AARTS clinic it is clearly evident that there were more patients suffering from allergic rhinitis during the months of March to June. 4 years back the peak pollen and mold season was between May to September (Ghosh et al., 2006) that has gradually shifted in 2007 to March-June so as the frequency of the patients visiting the Allergy Clinic. Background: $-(1,3)-glucan is pro-inflammatory and has been associated with airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms. Methods: This study assessed $-(1,3)-glucan levels from upper body clothing (jerseys) of 55 subjects. $-(1,3)-glucan levels were estimated with a modified Limulus amoebocyte lysate kinetic assay. Results: $-(1,3)-glucan levels ranged widely from 2,697 to 162,690 ng/g. $-(1,3)-glucan levels were significantly lower from cotton jerseys, and from warm water washed jerseys. Background: We have developed a natural CACR in which subjects will be exposed to consistent levels of Fel d 1, the major cat allergen, in a natural setting, such that there is transient exposure to disturbance of reservoir cat allergen. Objective: To develop the CACR in which Fel d 1 levels range from approximately 500Y2500 ng/m 3 . This concentration range of Fel d 1 was selected as it is representative of higher levels of Fel d 1 in homes with cats, and is known to induce an allergic and/or asthmatic response. Methods: The CACR is fully carpeted, contains a couch covered with a cotton sheet, and a chair. The CACR was preloaded with Fel d 1 using a proprietary aerosol generator and maintained by allergen from two CACR inliving cats. Fel d 1 levels were transiently increased by vigorously shaking the sheet to aerosolize Fel d 1. Fel d 1 airborne concentrations were measured using personal air samplers. Total airborne particulate was collected using a Button Sampler for 1h. Samples were analyzed using ELISA and particle sizes were independently measured with a laser particle counter. Results: Background measures indicated that Fel d 1 was undetectable in the CACR before aerosolization. Following one hour of 1g cat allergen aerosolization and 11 days cat housing, the average maximum total particle count was maintained over 4 consecutive days to be 9.01 T 3.65X105 ppm 3 and the Fel d 1 concentration 538 T 192 ng/m 3 . After an additional 2h aerosolization of 3.2g Fel d 1 and a total of 15 cat housing days, the average maximum total particle count maintained over an additional 4 consecutive days was 9.8 T 3.65X105 ppm 3 and the average Fel d 1 concentration was 621 T 135 ng/m 3 . Following an additional two days the concentration of Fel d 1 was 1046 T 982 g/m 3 . Overall, these two periods of aerosolization of Fel d 1 and a total of 20 cat housing days resulted in the mean concentration of Fel d 1 to be 686 T 455 ng/m 3 . Conclusion: These data indicate that aerosolized Fel d 1 is effective to obtain natural allergen levels rapidly and that live cats can maintain these levels over time within the targeted range. This work demonstrates that we have developed a CACR model that can be used towards the study of the etiology and putative therapeutics for cat allergy and asthma.

T cell phenotype following 1?25VitD3 ingestion was also analyzed. Results: We show that 1?25VitD3 alone inhibits Th1 and Th2 cytokine production, enhances the generation of IL-10-Treg, but also the percentage of FoxP3 positive cells. However expression of 1?25VitD3-induced IL-10 and FoxP3 appears mutually exclusive. Furthermore, optimal effects of 1?25VitD3 on IL-10, Foxp3 and effector cytokine production are observed at distinct drug concentrations. Dexamethasone selectively induced expression of TLR2 in vitro whilst 1?25VitD3 selectively induced expression of TLR9 on CD4+ T cells both in vitro and following patient ingestion of 1?25VitD3, in comparison to other T cell populations (naBve, CD25+ Treg, Th1, Th2). Ligation of these TLR on the drug-induced IL-10-Treg resulted in loss of Treg function in both cases, but by distinct mechanisms. Conclusion: Glucocorticoids and 1?25VitD3 promote IL-10 production and regulatory function in human CD4+ T cells alone and in combination. TLR2 and TLR9 can be used to distinguish glucocorticoid and 1?25VitD3 exposure of human CD4+ T cells and ligation of these receptors downregulates Treg function.",

Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Molecular Biotechnology, Perth, Australia. Background: Immunotherapy is an established form of treatment but it is necessary to develop more efficacious methods. We have developed a model for respiratory sensitisation induced by intranasal (i.n.) administration of the cysteine protease papain, without adjuvant. It produces high, boostable IgE titres. Upon challenge pulomonary eosinophilia is evident as is the release of Th2 cytokines into the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The model has been used to optimise sublingual desensitisation in mucosally sensitised animals. We have previously demonstrated its ability to suppress allergen specific IgE. In these studies lymph nodes were examined and the effect of the excipient chitosan. Methods: Allergic sensitisation was achieved by the i.n. administration of low doses of papain, a homologue of Der p 1. Desensitisation was examined after the sublingual administration of the antigen with chitosan, antigen alone, or chitosan alone. Serum antibodies were examined and high dose challenge followed by BAL was used to study cellular infiltrates and cytokine production in the lung. Lymph nodes were cultured and proliferation and cytokine production in response to allergen stimulation measured. Results: All treatments, even chitosan alone, suppressed IgE and IgG1 antibodies. Chitosan delivery at desensitisation resulted in a significant reduction of cells infiltrating the lungs that was not seen in the other treatment groups however both the chitosan alone and chitosan with papain significantly suppressed the neutrophilia seen. The Th2 cytokines in BAL fluid were not reduced in the treatment groups although all groups receiving chitosan had elevated levels of IL-10 and IFN-,. Cultured lymph node cells had lower levels of proliferation after sublingual therapy with a soluble antigen but when chitosan was used cells proliferated to similar levels to controls. Cytokine levels in lymph node cell supernatants showed significantly increased levels of TGF-$ and significantly decreased IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-, in all treatment groups. Conclusion: Sublingual immunotherapy decreased IgE and IgG antibodies but not lung inflammatory responses. It is however shown that lymph node proliferation and cytokine production was decreased and this could have a long-term effect. Chitosan caused a non-specific reduction that was not greater than allergen alone.",

Methods: Here we analyzed the antibody (IgE, IgG subclass, IgA, IgM) response to Bet v 1, recombinant and synthetic Bet v 1-derived peptides in birch pollen allergic patients who had been vaccinated with the derivatives or adjuvant alone.

            "text": "Early suppression of basophil activation during allergen-specific immunotherapy by upregulation of histamine receptor 2 Wroclaw University, Medical Faculty, Wroclow, Poland. Background: Most of the primary effects of allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) are exerted on effector cells. However, there is surprisingly few information about the mechanisms by which SIT modifies and suppresses immune responses of basophils and mast cells in particular during the repetitive administration of increasing allergen doses in the built-up phase. One of the main mediators released by effector cells upon allergen challenge is histamine. The diverse immunoregulatory functions of histamine are based on the differential distribution of histamine receptors on immunocompetent cells. While histamine receptor (HR)1 decreases humoral immunity and increases cellular immunity, HR2 displays opposing functions, decreasing cellular immunity and mediating tolerogenic immune mechanisms. Therefore, the early desensitizing effect of SIT due to reprogramming of effector cell responsiveness to histamine via the modulation of the histamine receptor repertoire represents an exciting and plausible strategy. Methods: Honey bee and wasp venom SIT was applied to 10 patients according to the rush protocol. The mRNA level of HR1, HR2 and HR4 in PBMC isolated from the peripheral blood of patients during the built-up phase of SIT (5 days) was evaluated by real time PCR. Histamine receptor mRNA levels in basophils enriched from the peripheral blood, which were triggered via IgE receptor were determined. Additionally, the activation state of basophils after IgE receptor cross-linking and treatment with ligands selective for HR2 as well as cAMP inducer forscolin, a second messenger of HR2, was analysed by flow cytometry and sulfido-leukotriene release assays.",

The selective triggering of HR2 with specific agonist dimaprit or forscolin strongly suppressed IgE-receptorinduced activation of basophils in a dose dependent fashion. Conclusion: HR2 mediates immunosilencing functions on IgE-receptor activated basophils.

While antigen-presenting cells such as Langerhans cells (LC) are thought to play a major role in the effectiveness of SLIT, mast cells (MC) most likely account for the observed adverse reactions such as oral itching and sublingual edema. Since only little is known about LC and MC within the oral cavity, we investigated their distribution in search for alternative mucosal application areas with the highest density of LC and lowest presence of MC. Methods: Different biopsies were taken simutaneously from mucosal tissue of the vestibular, buccal, palatinal, lingual, sublingual and gingival region (n = 10). Tissue was further processed for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. MC were detected by chymase, and LC by CD1a expression.",

            "text": "Results: The highest density of MC could be detected within the gingiva while the lowest density of MC was found within the palatinum and lingua. However, in the sublingual region MC were located within the lobe and duct of sublingual glands in a substantial number of individuals, which might explain swelling of sublingual caruncle in some SLIT patients. Considering LC, we could detect the highest density within the vestibular region followed by the region of bucca, palatinum and lingua. Interestingly, the lowest density of LC was located in the sublingual region. By flow cytometry, we investigated the expression of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc(RI) which might play a central role in allergen uptake during SLIT. Thereby, we could detect the highest expression of Fc(RI on LC of the vestibular region. Conclusion: In view of our data, different mucosal application sites such as the vestibulum might represent an alternative region with potent allergen uptake especially in SLIT patients suffering from sublingual edema. Furthermore our data might serve as a basis in the development of new application forms for SLIT such as tablets or stripes. Because probiotics were proposed to decrease the prevalence of allergy in susceptible individuals, we investigated whether they could affect IgEinduced mast cell secretory responses. To this end, mouse Bone Marrowderived Mast cells (BMMC) were exposed to lactic acid bacteria. BMMC express high-affinity receptors for IgE (Fc&RI) . When sensitized with IgE antibodies and challenged with specific antigen, they release and secrete a variety of inflammatory molecules including granular mediators and enzymes (among which \"-hexosaminidase), lipid mediators, cytokines (among which TNF-!) and chemokines. We checked first that none of the bacteria tested activate mast cells. Indeed, an incubation of BMMC for 20 min or 3 hr with bacteria (at a ratio of 1000 bacteria/cell) did not induced \"-hexosaminidase release or TNF-! secretion, respectively. We then investigated whether a previous exposure of BMMC to bacteria would affect the subsequent IgE-induced biological responses of mast cells. We found that an overnight incubation of BMMC with one strain of bacteria (at a ratio of 1000 bacteria/cell), prior to sensitization with IgE antibodies, inhibited Ag-induced \"-hexosaminidase release and TNF-! secretion. Live and gamma-irradiated bacteria were equally inhibitory. These bacteria did not decrease the expression of Fc&RI and did not affect sensitization of BMMC with IgE. Inhibition required a direct contact between cells and bacteria. Inhibition were similar in BMMC from TLR-2/4-, MyD88-, and NOD2-deficient mice as in BMMC from WT mice, excluding TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 , as well as NOD2 as being the responsible receptors. Preliminary works aiming at analyzing how bacteria interfere with Fc&RI signaling indicated that: 1) several intracellular signaling molecules had a reduced expression, 2) both early and late Fc&RI-dependent phosphorylation events were decreased, 3) I.B degradation was prevented, thus interfering with the nuclear translocation of NF-.B, 4) the IgE-induced increase of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ was profoundly inhibited. Altogether, our results indicate that probiotics, especially lactic acid bacteria, can exert direct inhibitory effects on mast cell activation. They support the idea that probiotics can protect from allergies, by preventing IgE-induced mast cell activation.",

Background: It is known that allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma are Th2 cells-mediated, however, the pivotal roles of allergen-specific Th2 cells in the induction of allergic lung inflammation have not been fully elucidated. The aim was to elucidate the imunopathological roles of allergenspecific-Th2 cells in allergic airway inflammation. Methods: Mice were epicutaneously sensitized with a major dust mite allergen, Blo t 5 and a well-characterized Blo t 5-specific-Th2 cell line was subsequently established from the splenocytes of the sensitized mice. The immunopathological roles of the cell line were assessed in vivo by adoptive cell transfer approach. NaBve mice received Blo t 5 specific-Th2 cells intravenously followed by intranasal challenge with Blo t 5. The responses of recipient mice were analysed by immunological and histochemical methods. Results: A long term TCRV$3 + Blo t 5 specific Th2 cell line producing high levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 but not IFN-, was established. These CD44 high CD62L -Th2 cells showed up-regulation of CTLA-4, ICOS, OX40, 4-1BB, CD27 but not CD40L upon stimulating with Blo t 5. After intranasal challenge with Blo t 5, Th2 cells recipient mice developed Blo t 5-specific IgG1 and IgE, airways eosinophilia and mucus production of the Goblet cells. In addition to the donor Th2 cells, the cellular infiltrate consisted of CD4 + , CD8 + T cells and NK cells of the recipient mice. Such cellular inflammation could be suppressed by dexamethasone intervention. The pathological results were not observed in the PBS challenged recipient mice. Conclusion: Blo t 5-specific Th2 cells played a central pathological role in mediating allergic airway inflammatory responses resembling those seen in humans.

Rationale: Foxp3, a responsible gene for IPEX syndrome in which both Th1 and Th2 responses are hyperreactive, is known as a master gene of naturally occurring regulatory T cell and maybe of some other regulatory T cell subsets. Therefore, the regulatory roles of Foxp3 + cells in allergic disorders are highly expected; however, the precise role of circulating Foxp3 + cells in common allergic diseases remains unclear. Then in order to evaluate its diagnostic potential, we examined intracellular Foxp3 protein expression in circulating peripheral blood CD4 + T cells from allergic patients and healthy controls at the single-cell level. Methods: The ratio of Foxp3 + CD4 + cells in the CD4 + cell fraction as well as various laboratory data were measured for 64 donors, including 37 patients with atopic dermatitis and/or bronchial asthma. None of the subjects was treated with oral corticosteroids. All the patients were judged positive for specific IgE antibodies against at least one of Dermatophagoides pternyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Japanese cedar pollen using Pharmacia's CAP system fluorescence enzyme-linked immunoassay (CAP-FEIA). Twenty-three of the 27 age-matched healthy volunteers also showed at least one positive reaction to those allergens by CAP-FEIA, although they never had subjective symptoms related to allergic diseases. Results: Foxp3 + CD4 + ratio in the total population was correlated inversely with the levels of total serum IgE (p = 0.021), % eosinophil count (p = 0.022), and serum IFN-, (p = 0.048). By performing a case-control study by matchedpair analysis to eliminate the influence of the Foxp3 + CD4 + level correlations with the total IgE level and eosinophil ratios, Foxp3 + CD4 + ratio was significantly lower in active atopic patients compared to asymptomatic donors having similar levels of IgE, eosinophils and IFN-,. Conclusion: Our findings imply that circulating Foxp3 + CD4 + regulates both Th1 and Th2 responses in vivo. Moreover, symptomatic atopic patients had a lower Foxp3 + CD4 + ratio than asymptomatic atopic controls having similar levels of Th1/Th2 markers. Measurement of Foxp3 + CD4 + ratio has the potential to aid in evaluating the presence of active inflammation in patients with allergic diseases, which can not be evaluated by known Th1 and Th2-related markers in patients with allergic diseases.",

Methods: Our 6-page standardized questionnaire was sent to doctors via post. The questionnaire is made up by questions on: a) methods of monitoring of childhood asthma, b) practices in managing acute asthma exacerbations, and c) choice of therapy in maintenance treatment. Results: Our study reflects mostly the practices of doctors who practice in urban regions. Of respondents, 41.4% were general pediatricians, while 26.3% were general practitioners. A small fraction of doctors used score cards or diaries to monitor asthma, ranging from 0% (Philippines and Australia) to 15.9% (India). Only 8.1% (Sri Lanka) to 51.7% (Australia) use either a peak flow meter and/or spirometry to monitor asthma. However, for frequency of usage, 35% (China) to 94% (Indonesia) never or seldom make use of a peak flow meter, and 33% (China) to 97.6% (Indonesia) never or seldom use spirometry for monitoring. Nebulised salbutamol given every 20 minutes was the treatment of choice in treating acute asthma attacks by the majority of doctors in each country, ranging from 29% (China) to 85.7% (Sri Lanka). A minority (4% (China) to 18.8% (Taiwan)) administer systemic corticosteroids in an outpatient setting (ER or polyclinic) in acute asthma. 53.6% (India) to 93.9% (Sri Lanka) of doctors also indicated that their duration for treatment with corticosteroids would be for 3Y5 days, and at the same dosage throughout the duration. A good number (32.7% (Sri Lanka) to 80.2% (Taiwan)) use antibiotics in the treatment of acute asthma, but only when pneumonia, otitis media or sinusitis was likely. Few doctors favoured high-dose inhaled corticosteroids in acute management, ranging from 0% (Indonesia and Sri Lanka) to 8. 4% (Philippines) . For maintenance treatment, a significant fraction of doctors chose a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) monotherapy as a firstchoice treatment for asthma maintenance. For infants the percentage ranged from 1.3% (Australia) to 76.3% (Indonesia),in preschoolers 0%(Australia) to 61% (China), and in older children, 0% (Philippines) to 61% (China). Conclusion: There is much room for improvement in increasing doctors' awareness to guidelines for more effective management of paediatric asthma in Southeast Asia, especially regarding the use of LABA monotherapy.",

Background: Inhaled Heparin was found to be highly protective against methacholine induced bronchospasm in bronchial asthma possibly via a direct effect on smooth muscle or may have potential as anti-inflammatory activity. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the additional therapeutic benefit of inhaled heparin in the treatment of hospitalized patients for acute asthmatic exacerbation and treated with inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoid therapy. Methods: Thirty patients (20 male, 10 female), mean age( 31 +/j 10 years), admitted for acute exacerbation of asthma, participated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. All the subjects received hydrocortisone, administered intravenousl, and nebulized salbutamol. The treatment group received inhaled heparin therapy (20,000 U in 4 mL) every 4 hr. and the placebo group received 0.9% saline solution for 24 hours. Baseline respiratory parameters such as oxygen saturations, respiratory rates, and peak Background and Aims: Recently, we could demonstrate that mucosal targeting with Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) coated Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) microspheres modulated a specific immune response in birch pollen allergy. Using grass pollen as a novel allergen encapsulated in AAL-coated particles we aimed to further evaluate the immune modulating functionality of microspheres in a murine asthma model. Methods: BALB/c mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with grass pollen extract followed by aerosol challenges inducing acute allergic asthma. Thereafter, animals were treated repeatedly with grass pollen loaded PLGA microspheres coated with AAL for M-cell targeting. Mice immunized with microspheres coated with glycine, with further intraperitoneal allergen injections and naBve animals served as control. The outcome of the treatment was evaluated by measurements of grass pollen specific antibodies (IgG1, IgG2a, IgE and IgA) in sera and bronchio-alveolar lavage (BAL) and by determination of cytokine profiles (IL-5, IL-10, TGF-$) in spleen supernatants. Results: In the animals treated with AAL-coated mircrospheres allergenspecific IgG1, IgG2a and IgE levels were unaffected by treatment. However, allergen-specific IgA levels increased during therapy. Interestingly, in cytokine evaluations IL-10 levels did not change, whereas reduced amounts of IL-5 and high levels of TGF-$ were measured in the mice treated with AALfunctionalized microspheres compared to the other groups. Conclusion: These data indicated that in the murine model grass pollen allergy was beneficially influenced by targeting M-cells via AAL-coated, allergenloaded microspheres. Thus, the potential of functionalized microparticles for specific immunotherapy for acute respiratory allergy was confirmed.",

            "text": "Oral sulforaphane safely and effectively induces antioxidant phase II enzymes in the human airway Substantial evidence implicates particulate air pollution exposure as an important factor for asthma exacerbations and the increasing prevalence of allergic respiratory disease. As the inflammatory effects of particulate air pollution are mediated by the induction of cellular oxidative stress, strategies to reduce oxidative stress may potentially reduce the harmful effects of particulate air pollution. Endogenous Phase II enzymes abrogate oxidative stress through metabolism of particulate-associated reactive chemicals and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species. We conducted a placebo-controlled dose escalation trial to investigate the in vivo effects of sulforaphane, a naturally occuring potent inducer of Phase II enzymes, on the expression of GSTM1, GSTP1, NQO1, and HO-1 in the upper airway of human subjects. Sixty human study subjects consumed oral standardized broccoli sprout homogenate (BSH) doses containing sulforaphane once daily for 3 consecutive days. An escalating block design was used with 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 grams (g) of BSH to ensure safety and tolerability. Additional subjects were subsequently enrolled at doses of 125, 150, 175, and 200 g to examine dose-response effect. Five subjects completed the protocol with non-sulforaphane containing alfalfa sprout homogenate dosing at 200 g as a control group. RNA expression for selected Phase II enzymes was measured in nasal lavage cells by RT-PCR ( \u2020 Wilcoxon) Nebulized single dose formoterol powder (24 mcg) is as effective as three doses of albuterol and at one fifth the cost in children's acute asthma; is well tolerated and patients of all ages can benefit. Nebulized Formoterol single dose is non -inferior to three doses of albuterol and underscores many possibly substantial care savings, given the heavy load that acute asthma care represents in our country and many other developing nations (3) . * PARI \\ nebulizer (Pronet Turbo) 1 before and after BSH dosing. All subjects tolerated oral BSH dosing without significant adverse events. Increased Phase II enzyme expression in nasal lavage cells occurred in a dose dependent manner with maximal enzyme induction observed at the highest dose of 200 g BSH. At 200 g BSH daily GSTM1, GSTP1, NQO1, and HO-1 expression was 219, 201, 299, and 221% of baseline expression respectively (p e 0.001 for all enzymes). Phase II enzyme induction was not seen with ingestion of non-sulforaphane containing alfalfa sprouts. Thus, oral sulforaphane safely and effectively induces mucosal Phase II enzyme expression in the upper airway of human subjects. Based on this work and previous in vitro/animal studies, sulforaphane may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of allergic respiratory conditions. Additional studies are underway to determine whether Phase II enzyme induction is effective in reducing the inflammatory effects of particulateinduced oxidative stress in the human airway. Background: Increasing incidences of Aspergillus fumigaus-induced allergic asthmatics all over the world necessitate identification of a catalogue of allergens of clinical importance. In the present study, immunoproteomic approach was used to establish a set of candidate allergens, which could be explored further for diagnostic application in allergic aspergillosis and asthmatics including ABPA. Methods: Immunoproteomics combined with mass spectrometric analysis was used to identify proteins of three-week culture filtrate (3wcf) responsible for inducing A. fumigatus-specific IgE immunoreactivity, using pooled sera from A. fumigatus-sensitised asthmatics. Their diagnostic potential was also examined against patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), by 2-DE immunoblotting with individual sera from such patients. Results: Peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and/or de novo sequencing by MS/MS analysis of the protein spots from 2-D gels led to identification of a total of sixteen allergens of A. fumigatus. Eleven of them are being reported as allergens for the first time and five were reported earlier. Putative isoforms of the proteins Asp f 13 and chitosanase have been observed for the first time. When studied for immunoreactivity of these proteins among patients with ABPA using their individual sera, these patients exhibited sensitisation although the pattern was varying. Taken together, these proteins could thus be considered as potential allergens even among patients with ABPA. Three of these proteins viz. the hypothetical protein, extracellular arabinase and chitosanase could be major allergens. Conclusion: The immunoproteomic approach applied to the analysis of culture filtrate proteins resulted in identification of several candidate allergens, many of them novel, contributing to the catalogue of A. fumigatus allergenic proteins. These allergens may facilitate improved serodiagnosis for allergic aspergillosis.",

Background: The extensive and unorganized planting and cultivation of the holly olive trees in our country is the first cause of allergy. Olive tree (olea europaea) pollen is a major cause of seasonal allergy-making it the first outdoor pollen calendar in Jordan. To date, ten allergens, named Ole e 1 to Ole e 10, have been isolated and characterized from this pollen Ole e 10, a small protein, has been recently described as a major allergen from this pollen, since it affects more than 55% of allergic patients. Few studies regarding olive allergy have been reported in our area. The olive pollination season lasts two months approximately from the middle of May to the middle of July. Objective: The main aim of this study was to address the performance of olive screen testing by total and specific IgE and the cross reaction with other pollens. Methods: Total and specific serum IgE to olive pollen was tested and evaluated in 400 allergic patients before, during and after the peak pollen season using immunoblot Allergy Screen-Respiratory pannel. Results: Out of the 400 patients serum specimens 132 (30%) had allergy to IgE olive pollens. 125(94%) of the allergic patients had elevated total serum IgE 9100 IU/ml). 10 samples from healthy subjects were used as negative controls. Cross-reactivity with orange, Banana, Grass pollens and Ambrosia has been noticed in 10 cases (15%).

Background: Previous investigations established dose-response curves between the severity of clinical symptoms and specific IgE antibody levels to both indoor and food allergens in allergic individuals. We questioned whether this also holds true for outdoor allergens e.g. grass pollen allergens. Methods: 100 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and allergy to timothy grass pollen as well as 40 healthy controls were recruited during the grass pollen season in 2006 and 2007. To investigate the correlation between IgE antibody levels and threshold in vivo reactivity we determined specific serum IgE antibodies to timothy grass pollen (ImmunoCAPi, Phadia AB, Uppsala) at three time points during one year (June/July; October; December) and performed conjunctival and nasal provocation tests with grass pollen extracts at different concentrations (Phleum pratense, HAL Allergy, Duesseldorf, Germany). In addition, skin prick tests were performed. The investigations were paralleled by grass pollen counts using a Burkard trap performed at the University Campus Biederstein, Munich (G50 m distant from the laboratory, 1.80 m above the ground). Additionally, the patients scored their symptoms with visual analog scales and exhaled nitric oxide was analysed as measure for inflammatory lung reaction. Results: Preliminary results from 41 patients with ARC revealed a significant relationship between specific IgE concentration in serum and the titrated level of the skin prick test (p G 0.0096, Jonckheere-Terpstas trend test). However, no correlation between specific serum IgE to timothy grass and thresholds of nasal and conjunctival provocation tests were found. Conclusion: Measurement of specific serum IgE levels seems to accurately predict the in vivo reactivity with regard to skin prick test in patients with ARC to grass pollen allergen. The preliminary results indicate a good correlation between indicators of sensitization, but not between serum IgE levels and threshold allergen concentrations that induce symptoms Further data analysis concerning conjunctival and nasal provocation tests and symptom scores in a greater number of patients is in progress.",

Introduction: Drug hypersensitivity to beta-lactam was often skin tested using benzyl-penicillin, major (PPL) and minor (MDM) penicillin determinants, amoxicillin, ampicillin and any other culprit beta-lactam. However, PPL and MDM were removed from the marked. The aim of the study was to assess the importance of benzylpenicillin before and after the withdrawal. Methods: Using our Drug Allergy and Hypersensitivity Database (DAHD) and data coming from an Italian centre, we conducted an historico-prospective cohort study. All patients who consulted between 1996 and 2007 for a suspected beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction and who had at least positive skin test to benzylpenicillin were included. Diagnosis and skin tests followed the European Network on Drug allergy (ENDA) recommendations. Benzylpenicillin, PPL, MDM, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin were always skin tested. Results: 133 patients (48Y36.1% men), 15 (11.3%) asthmatics and 41 (30.8%) atopics were included. 13 (9.8%) were only positive to benzylpenicillin, 32 (26.5%) were also positive for PPL and 66 (55.5%) for MDM. Without skin testing for PPL and MDM, the number of positive to benzylpenicillin increased to 20 (15.0%). No difference was observed for asthma and atopic between subjects only positive to benzylpencillin and those also positive for another penicillin (p = 0.84 and p = 0.34 respectively). Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock were more common in subjects positive to several penicillins (76Y67.3% vs 7Y35%, p = 0.001). Conversely, only 26 (23.0%) vs 8 (40.0%) presented an urticaria / angiodema. Conclusion: Since the withdrawal of PPL and MDM, benzylpenicillin skin test appeared to be mandatory, 15% of the patients being only positive to this drug. This should significantly reduce oral challenges.",

Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Enviromental Immuno-Dermatology, Yokohama, Japan. Background: (BDrug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) is a unique severe adverse drug reaction, which is well known to be accompanied with reactivation of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) in many cases 2Y3 weeks after development of drug reactions. The clinical features of this syndrome are acute widespread maculopapular, polymorphous, eczematous and/or erythrodermic erythema, fever, lymph node swelling, liver dysfunction, eosinophilia and leukocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. After first reports of DIHS with HHV-6 reactivation in Japan in 1998, 118 cases have been reported with data of HHV-6 reactivation up to now. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed recent reports of suspected adverse drug reactions submitted to medical journals from Japan, in order to define the presenting characteristics of these diseases in Japan. Results: Ages ranged from 0 to 89 years old with a mean of 48.6 years old and the ratio of M/F was 64/54. 63.7 % of causative drugs were anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, 63.3% of the anticonvulsant drugs). The other common causative drugs were sulfonamides, mexilletine (an antiarrhythmic drug) and allopurinol. The symptoms developed 3 weeks or more after the beginning of causative drug administration in 80.5% of the patients. Recurrence of the symptoms was observed in 40% of the patients. Four of them died and the mortality rate was 3.6%. Reactivation of HHV-6 was detected in 83.9% of the patients by the increase of IgG against HHV-6 and/or increase of HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood and sera. On the other hand, reactivation of cytomegalovirus was observed in 4 patients without HHV-6 reactivation. In treatment of 118 patients with DIHS, steroid without puls was in 71 cases (60.2%), steroid puls with mPSL in 15 cases (12.7%; 1g/day in 40.0% of 6/15, under 1g/ day in 33.3% of 5/15, unclear in 26.7% of 4/15), intravenous injection of high dose immunoglobulin (IVIG) with steroid in 5 cases (4.2%) , and plasmaapheresis (PA) with steroid in 3 cases (2.5%). The mortality in DIHS was unexpectedly high as 3.4% (4/118) , as compared to that in SJS. Discussion: A probable role of HHV-6 in DIHS was discussed in comparison of that of Epstein-Barr (EB) virus in infectious mononucleosis and Mosquito bite hypersensitivity.",

This diagnosis can be vigorous and based on clinical history and a physical examination, possibly under skin tests and drug provocation test. We intend to describe the out come of drug provocation test in analyzing patients with histories suggesting drug allergy, using retrospective analysis of clinic case series. Methods: Some 416 consecutive patients with suspected immediate drug allergy referred to the hospital between, January 1999 to February 2005. Patients with served skin reaction and those with positive result on skin test for B-lactams were excluded. it should be noted that single-blinded administration of increasing doses of the suspected drug up to the usual daily dose, under struck hospital surveillance. Results: 920 drug provocation tests were performing using various drugs, including aspirin (11.4%) nonsteroidel anti-inflammatory drugs (7.5%) macrolides (8.5%) paracetamole (10.1%) and other non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (12.2%). We had 192 (15.6%) positive provocation test results which also reproduce the same symptoms, albeit milder and of a shorter duration -in the following patients.10 (4.2%) with history of anaphylactic shock, 15(5.5%) the history of anaphylaxis without shock. 70 (46.4%) with a history of urticaria and 5(2.4%) with a history maculopapular eruption. All reactions were completely refers by prednisone and epinephrine. However, we assume or accept that false negative results on drug provocation test may have occurred because of sanitation, rare cofactors not included in the diagnostic procedure and tolerance introduction during provocation. Conclusion: It can be certain that drug provocation tests in individuals with suspected drug allergy performed in carefully control settings can confirm drug hypersensitivity.",

After at least 48 hours off antihistamines, the patient was rechalleged with white or light yellow colored drugs to minimize excipients the patient may be sensitized to. Rechallenge was considered successful if there was no recurrence of symptoms while on the multiple antituberculous drug regimen. Results: Sixty-six patients were referred for ADR to antituberculous medications. Forty-five had CHR. Forty-two patients were rechallenged. Fourteen were successful. Sixteen had documented cutaneous adverse reactions to one or more drugs with the highest incidence occurring with ethambutol and pyrazinamide. The success rate of rechallenge was 14/42. Conclusion: 1. Skin allergy is common (68%) with first line anti-TB drugs. The most common drugs associated with CHR were ethambutol and pyrazinamide; 2. The success rate of drug rechallenge when shifting to a different brand of anti-TB medication is 14/42 (33%) 143 Meta-analysis: Risk of angioedema with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with prior angioedema associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) Bret Haymore 1 , Jiun Yoon 1 , Cecilia Mikita 1 , and Kent DeZee 2 . 1 Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Allergy-Immunology, Washington DC, United States; 2 William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Internal Medicine, El Paso, United States. Background: Patients who experience angioedema (AE) after taking ACE-I have been reported to develop AE when taking an ARB, but few studies describe the risk. We sought to answer this question by performing a systematic review of the medical literature. Methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and Current Contents with no limitations from Jan 1990-May 2007. SCISEARCH was also used to identify additional citations of key articles. Reference lists of retrieved studies and review articles were evaluated for additional citations. Two authors independently evaluated studies for inclusion and abstracted relevant data according to pre-defined parameters. Any article that described a cohort of patients who had experienced AE after taking an ACE-I, were subsequently exposed to an ARB and followed for at least one month were included. The percentage of patients experiencing AE was abstracted from each article and confidence intervals were calculated using the exact binomial method. The pooled percentage was calculated using the inverse variance method. Results: From the 238 unique articles initially identified, three articles describing 71 patients met inclusion criteria. One was a randomized controlled trial and two were retrospective cohorts. The mean age of patients was 63 years with 56% male and 44% female. Two of the studies were predominantly Caucasian subjects with the third study being 69% African-American. The mean time of follow-up was 20.3 months. These articles described both confirmed and possible cases of AE secondary to ARB. For possible cases the risk of AE was 9.4% (95%CI 1.6Y17); for confirmed cases it was 3.5% (95% CI 0Y9.2). There were no fatal events. There was no statistical heterogeneity between trials (p 9 0.3). Conclusion: Limited evidence suggests that for patients who developed AE when taking an ACE-I, the risk of developing any AE when taking an ARB is between 2Y17% and for confirmed AE the risk is 0Y9.2%. This information will aid clinicians in counseling patients regarding therapy options after developing AE due to ACEI. nervous systems as well as the immune and hematopoietic systems. IL-31 was secreted in larger amounts preferentially in Th2 than in Th1 cells. IL-31 functiones by the heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-31RA and OSMR that is expressed constitutively on epithelial cells and keratinocytes. These cells are likely to be involved in the dermatitis and pruritis of patients upregulating IL-31. Objective and Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 22 patients with atopic dermatitis allergic to hen-egg ranging from 1 to 13 years in age, as well as from 9 healthy individuals who had no allergic symptoms. The patients had recurrent eczema, pruritis and positive skin reactions to egg white. Patients also had positive responses to the oral provocation test to raw hen egg. Diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis was based on the criteria of Hanifin and Rajk. We evaluated expression of IL-31-pruducing cells by the methods of newly developed FCAS analysis. Results and Discussion: IL-31 was preferentially expressed in CLA (skinhorming cutaneous lymphocyte antigen) as well as CD45RO-positive cells in atopic children complaining of skin lesions and pruritis compared to normal subjects. Severity of these symptoms were correlated with amount of IL-31 in the cells. Conclusion: These result suggests larger amounts of expression of IL-31 is likely to be involved in the pruritis as well as skin lesions in atopic children.",

            "text": "Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is often complicated by an enhanced susceptibility to bacterial skin infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Toll-like receptors, especially (TLR)-2 recognizes cell wall components of S. aureus, e.g. lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) . A heterozygous TLR-2 R753Q polymorphism occurs in a frequency of 11.5% in adult AD patients and has been shown to be associated with a severe phenotype. Objective and Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of TLR-2 agonists (LTA, PGN and Pam3Cys) on cytokine production and cell surface marker expression in human monocytes from AD patients with the TLR-2 R753Q polymorphism compared to AD patients with Bwild typeT LR-2 and control individuals to elucidate the functional role of the TLR-2 R753Q polymorphism. Results: We could show that AD patients with the TLR-2 R753Q mutation produced significantly more IL-6 and IL-12 and significantly less IL-8 compared to AD patients with non-mutated TLR-2 upon stimulation with TLR-2 agonists. Expression of CD86 was significantly higher upon Pam3Cys stimulation in TLR-2 R753Q polymorph patients. Expression of CD80 was unaffected after stimulation with TLR2 agonists. Conclusion: We show for the first time functional differences in TLR-2 responsiveness of monocytes from AD patients with the TLR-2 R753Q mutation compared to wild type AD patients in a ligand dependant manner. Clinical implication: Our data stratify the emerging concept that AD patients have a dysbalance in innate as well as aquired immunity. TLR-2 might be essential in the pathogenesis of AD and involved both in the enhanced susceptibility to skin infections with S. aureus and in a higher inflammatory response in patients with the TLR-2 polymorphism.",

Background: Prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) in Japanese population has been rapidly increased for these decades. Impact of AD on their quality of life (QOL) is difficult to be assessed by using a translated QOL scale developed in western nations because of the influence of different culture. The aim of this study is to develop an original QOL assessment scale for Japanese patient with atopic dermatitis. Methods: We have collected our own data from patients who visited Japanese hospitals and clinics by using an anonymous open questionnaire and some by interviews. One hundred and eighty items were extracted from whole data and based on them, secondary questionnaire comprising 68 items was made by expert's discussion. It was applied to 200 patients with atopic dermatitis for psychometric item reduction. Results: Through the process of factor analysis and item analysis, sixty eight items were converged to 9 items comprising of four factors such as influence to daily activities, burden of medication, itchiness generated annoyance, anxiety about future. Internal consistency of each factor was excellent such that Cronbach\" of each factor was 0.0772, 0.843, 0.865 and 0.789. Item content and factor loading score of each item is weak enthusiasm o.818, influence of sleep disturbance 0.617, burden of house keeping 0.589, burden of topical therapy 0.824, unwillingness of topical application 0.817, annoyance to itchiness 0.821, annoyance to scratching 0.756, anxiety about remission 0.824, and anxiety of fluctuating symptoms 0.684. Conclusion: This study has revealed impact of atopic dermatitis on the QOL of patient is not only associated with dermatological symptoms but also adherence burden and anxiety about prognosis. The compact 9 time questionnaire developed in Japan this time would be useful to detect compre-hensive quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis even in a busy situation of our outpatient clinics.",

The aim of the project was an evaluation of the usefulness of selected eosinophil proteins in serum (ECP, EPX) and urine (EPX) of children suffering from AD, as markers of disease severity. The study also aimed to analyze correlations between the level of examined proteins and such parameters as: skin prick tests (SPT) results, serum concentration of total IgE and coexistance of symptoms of other atopic diseases. We examined 40 AD children attending Allergic Diseases Diagnostic Center and hospitalized in the Department of Dermatology. As control group we selected 23 healthy children without any symptoms of allergic diseases. Mean level of eosinophil proteins measured in serum (ECP, EPX) and urine (EPX) of children suffering from AD was higher than in controls and statistically significant difference was detected for serum level of EPX. Patients presenting with very severe/severe AD had higher level of eosinophil proteins than patients presenting with mild/moderate AD, although no significant difference was found. AD children with positive SPT results and detectable serum specific IgE presented with higher mean level of serum and urine eosinophil proteins than in compared groups of patients with negative SPT results and undetectable serum specific IgE, although with no statistically significant difference. Total IgE level in AD children representing allergic form of the disease was statistically significantly higher than in children with non-allergic AD. In children with very severe/severe AD, total IgE level was significantly higher than in children with moderate/mild disease. Results presented above indicate singnificant role of eosinophils in etiopathogenesis of AD. Measurements of serum and urine level of selected eosinophil proteins may be considered as an important part of diagnostic approach in children suffering from AD, especially in differentiating of allergic and non-allergic form of disease. Among eosinophil proteins, EPX has always been the subject of particularly thorough investigations, because of easy and non-invasive way of measurement in urine, which is an important feature in diagnostics of children. EPX is a marker significantly better differentiating AD patients from healthy individuals in comparison to other factors, such as ECP and peripheral blood eosinophilia.",

Methods: NGF in the horny layer (horn NGF) of skin lesions on the cubital fossa was collected via tape stripping and measured using ELISA in AD patients before and after 2 and 4 week treatments. Itching and eruptions on the whole body and on lesions measured for NGF were evaluated. Peripheral blood eosinophil count, serum LDH level and serum total IgE level were also examined. Results: The level of NGF was significantly higher in AD patients than in healthy controls, and correlated with the severity of itch, erythema, scale/ xerosis, eosinophil count, and LDH level. The NGF level decreased significantly after treatments with olopatadine and/or topical steroid for 2 and 4 weeks. The decrease of NGF correlated with the decrease in the severity of itching, severity of AD on the whole body, erythema, papule, scale/xerosis and lichenification of the lesion, eosinophil count, and LDH level. Conclusion: The level of the horn NGF was found to reflect the severity of itching and eruptions in AD. Therefore, measurement of the NGF via this harmless method appears to be useful in assessing severity and therapeutic effects in AD.",

Introduction: C-C chemokines, including RANTES, MIP-1, MCP-2, and the CCR5 specific receptor play an important role in the genesis of allergic inflammation. The presence of homozygosis for the delta32 (d32) polymorphism of CCR5 produces the absence of this receptor from the cell surface and heterozygosis promotes a very low expression of this receptor, hence reducing the availability of receptors capable of interacting with chemokines to induce the inflammatory response. We have previously informed a reduced risk of developing asthma and rhinitis in adults that present the d32 allelic variant. We could not find any report about the relationship between d32 and atopic dermatitis (AD), urticaria (URT) or angioedema (ANG). Objective: To evaluate association between d32 polymorphism and AD, URT and ANG in adults from Rosario city. Materials and Methods: 111 caucasian subjects, 36 males (32.7%) and 74 females (67.3%), aged 19 to 46 years old (x = 23.88 T 4.45), answered questionnaires for AD (ISAAC), URT and ANG. DNA was extracted from blood samples and d32 polymorphism was determined by PCR. Oligonucleotide sequences were: sense: 5 \u00b6-GTCTTCCATTACACCTGCAGCTCT-3 \u00b6, antisense: 5 \u00b6-CACAGCCCTGTGCCTCTT-3 \u00b6. Results: 6.3% of the subjects presented the heterozygotic polymorphism and 0.9% the homozygotic polymorphism. The risk of suffering from AE, URT or ANG was significantly lower in the subjects that presented the d32 polymorphism. Among the subjects that referred for AD symptoms at least once in their life (15.3%), no one presented heterozygosis or homozygosis for d32, while in the subjects that did not refer these symptoms the frequency of the same genotype was 8.5% (RR = 0.83 IC:0.77Y0.91; p G 0.05). Among the subjects that referred for URT symptoms at least once in their life (36.9%), 2.4% presented heterozygosis or homozygosis for d32, while in the subjects that did not refer these symptoms the frequency of the same genotype was 11.1% (RR = 0.70 IC:0.52Y0.95; p G 0.05). Similar results were obtained in subjects that referred for ANG symptoms at least once in their life (13.6%), since no one presented heterozygosis or homozygosis for this polymorphism, while in the individuals that did not refer these symptoms the frequency of the mentioned allele was 8.4% (RR= 0.85 IC:0.79Y0.92; p G 0.05). Conclusion: The results obtained in this study allow us to suggest that the reduced risk to develop AD, URT and ANG could be influenced by the presence of the CCR5-d32 allelic variant. Background: In contrast to the advancement of knowledge on the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), establishing international diagnostic criteria standards remains a challenge. The criteria of Hanifin and Rajka, though extensively mentioned in research settings, rely on features with significant variation due to age, ethnicity or other factors and may be unsuitable for epidemiological studies when clear-cut case/control definitions are needed. The validity of the UK Working Party criteria has been reported in population and hospital-based studies, mostly in children. Data concerning adults are however very limited. Objective: We aimed to test the validity of the UK Working Party criteria in adult patients referred to a university hospital in Bulgaria. We also tested the relevance of six clinical signs commonly associated with AD without being criteria, namely, fine hair, periorbital and periauricular dermatitis, infraauricular fissures, cheilitis angularis and Hertoghe sign. Methods: 118 patients aged 18Y60 years were recruited for the study. All patients were examined independently by a senior dermatologist and a resident, both blinded to the study aim. The results were evaluated by a third independent and blinded observer using contingency tables. Results: We found higher sensitivity (94,03%), specificity (92,16%), positive (94,03%) and negative (92,16%) predictive value for the UK Working Party diagnostic criteria than for the ones of Hanifin and Rajka (88,06%;82,35%; 86,76;55,26 respectively). Family history for atopy and erythroderma were significant factors for false positive results. Of the additionally examined features, the highest sensitivity and specificity was found for Binfraauricular fissures [ (59,70% and 84,31%, respectively) . Conclusion: Our results confirm the validity of the UK Working Party criteria in an adult hospital population in Bulgaria. Although the cases may represent a more severe disease end spectrum, there are only few systematic publications on AD features in adulthood and our study provides valuable data on the performance of the diagnostic criteria and relevance of the individual clinical signs in this age group.",

Background: There is little data on the correlation between atopic dermatitis and other atopic diseases (asthma, rhinitis) and atopy markers (positive skin prick test and specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronissinus /Dpt./). This is why the comorbidity of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma and the presence of atopy markers should be further investigated as well as the correlation between the positive atopy markers and a positive patch test with Dpt. Methods: The correlation between patch-test and skin prick test with Dpt. and specific IgE was evaluated in 32 patients (8 men), with atopic dermatitis, 27 had rhinitis as a concomitant disease (17 with allergic rhinitis) and 16 had bronchial asthma. All of them were tested for specific IgE and skin prick test and patch test with Dpt. were performed. Results: 17 patients had a positive patch test with Dpt., 12 had positive specific IgE antibodies to Dpt. and 14 -positive skin prick test with Dpt. Conclusion: Cases with a positive patch test prevail when compared to positive skin prick test and specific IgE. Positive patch test does not always correlate with atopy, evaluated as positive skin prick tests and specific IgE to Dpt. The patch test could be used as a routine and reliable method in practice for evaluating the role of Dpt. in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.",

These cases were treated with different types of symptomatic drugs for last 7 to 10 yrs, but did not yield any significant result and these were labeled as difficult dermatitis. Materials and Methods: Ten such patients who were referred to our clinic were subjected to detailed medical history & clinical examinations. We decided to perform skin prick test (modified SPT) as to determine possible role of airborne allergens. These patients showed positive skin prick test reactions to many allergens such as Asp. flavus, Asp.Tarmare, Alt Alternaria, D. Farinae, D.Pter., House dust, Hay dust, Parthenium & Paltophorm among airborne allergens, while reactions were observed significantly positive to certain food allergens also ( Milk, Almond, Yeast, Hazel nut ) .Since there patients showed strong reactivity to certain allergens (IgE mediated hypersensitivity), an attempt was made to administer allergen immunotherapy course. Allergens which were strongly positive and showed airborne dominance in the vicinity of the patient were selected for allergen immunotherapy mixture. The allergen immunotherapy was initiated on this subject as per guidelines laid down by WHO.",

Patients and Methods: In a two-year period, 655 consecutive patients were patch tested in Peking University Third Hospital for suspected ACD. At one year after patch testing, all patients were asked a revisit and prognosis of ACD was evaluated by the rate of clearance (complete free of dermatitis without recurrence for more than 3 month before the final evaluation). Results: Of 599 patients finished study, 167 cases were ACD. The rates of clearance and relapse were 49.7% and 41.9% respectively. Concurrence of atopic diathesis, ichthyosis, history of drug allergy as well as disease location had no effect on the clearance rate. Significant lower clearance rate (26.8%) was found in patients with longer disease duration (over 6 months) before diagnosis. The clearance rate in patients with non-continuous ACD was also lower than that of continuous ACD (28.3% vs. 59.6%, chi square test). Ignorant reexposure to contact allergens was the mean reason for relapse. Conclusion: 1-year outcome of ACD is not as good as expected. Longer disease duration before diagnosis and non-continuous ACD are main risk factors for poor prognosis. Patients with suspected ACD should be patch tested as early as possible. Mandatory ingredient labeling and sufficient patient education are necessary to improve the prognosis of ACD.",

            "text": "Fishing for allergens hiding as prohaptens: cinnamic aldehyde but not cinnamic alcohol identified as potent sensitizer Skin is a major target organ of allergic reactions to small molecular weight compounds such as allergic contact dermatitis or allergic drug allergy. It has been generally accepted that most small molecular weight compounds must be bound to high molecular weight compounds in order to become immunogenic. For this binding of the hapten to a protein the hapten must be a highly reactive chemical such as intermediate metabolites of cytochrome P450 (CYP) dependent metabolism of prohaptens. Recently we demonstrated the usefulness of an organotypic CYP cocktail to identify prohaptens by combining such a CYP cocktail with a dendritic cell-based in vitro model to identify sensitizing small molecular weight compounds (Bergstr\u00f6m et al., JID 127 (2007 Mukhtar et al., JID (2007) 992Y993). Cinnamic alcohol is oxidised to cinnamic aldehyde by a CYPdependent metabolism. Therefore we were interested whether cinnamic aldehyde is the nominative antigen in allergic reactions to cinnamic alcohol. We generated immature DCs from human peripheral blood monocytes by depletion of CD2, CD7, CD19, CD56, CD16, CD235a positive leukocytes and consecutive incubation with GM-CSF and IL-4. At least 6 million cells were stimulated with the following test compounds for 30 hours respectively: 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid -TNBS (200 mg/ml), sodium dodecyl sulfate -SDS (5 mg/ml), dimethyl sulfoxide -DMSO (0.1%), CAld (0,1 mM) and CAlc (0.1 mM). After RNA isolation of the treated cells, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed using a primer/probe set specific for the detection of IL-8 mRNA expression. A sensitizing effect of CAld could be shown for all 6 donors as indicated by a median IL-8 upregulation of 34.3 fold normalized relative to mediumtreated controls. In contrast, the median enhancement of IL-8 mRNA expression was not significantly greater after incubation with CAlc (2.13) than after stimulation with SDS (2.22), DMSO (1.2) . In conclusion, cinnamic aldehyde possesses a stronger allergenic activity than cinnamic alcohol which is CYP-dependently metabolised to cinnamic aldehyde. These results further supports the concept that the combination of prohapten modified organotypic CYP cocktails with a dendritic cell-based in vitro model of contact allergens may streamline and increase the predictive efficiency of current safety test methods in allergic contact dermatitis.",

Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiol., Erlangen, Germany. Background: It is a worldwide observation that patients exposed to diagnostic patch tests are predominantly women. This is commonly explained by distinct sex-related patterns of allergen exposure that cause different patterns of sensitization in men and women and by a higher health awareness of women. Nevertheless, additional sex-related differences in the responsiveness to contact allergens should be taken into consideration. Methods: Sex-related reaction profiles of 16 common patch test allergens that are used in standard patch test series were retrospectively analysed based on data of 47.000 patients filed by the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology in Germany within a period of 10 years. All patch tests had been done by use of identical methods in patients with suspected contact allergy but no history of atopic dermatitis. The proportions of weak positive reactions and of questionable and irritant reactions were evaluated by calculating the positivity ratio and the reaction index separately for men and women for each allergen. Results: Out of the 16 allergens evaluated, 8 had a slightly higher positivity ratio and a slightly higher reaction index in women than in men. 4 allergens had a lower positivity ratio and another 4 had a lower reaction index in women than in men, but no allergen had a lower positivity ratio plus a lower reaction index in women than in men. In particular for allergens with similar rates of positive reactions in men and women female sex was significantly related with a higher positivity ratio and reaction index (pG0.01). Conclusion: There is a small but statistically significant disparity in the reactivity of men and women to common patch test allergens. Women in general have a higher rate of weak positive reactions but less questionable or irritant reactions to an allergen than men. This marginal difference is probably not relevant for patch testing but adds a new element to the pathogenetic puzzle of contact allergy.",

Atopy and the \"hapten hypothesis\" Background: Whilst allergy to food proteins is almost exclusively seen in atopics, it has been our impression that this does not hold true for haptens/ contact allergens which are present in our diet. Diallyl disulfide is the major haptenic allergen in garlic and allergic contact dermatitis to this has been observed in people who handle garlic whilst preparing food. Parabens and lanolin are both contact allergens commonly used in many cosmetic and medicament creams. However, unlike lanolin, the preservative parabens is used in some processed foods. We retrospectively reviewed data from our patch test clinic, comparing the frequency of allergy rates (patch test positive, PT+) to these haptens between atopic eczema/dermatitis AD and non-AD dermatitis patients. Results: Between 1980 and 2006 in total population of 36658 patients with eczema/dermatitis were patch tested, of whom 10326 (28.2%) had AD; in contrast 13/83 (12.5 %) patients PT+ to diallyl disulfide/garlic had AD (AD/total population vs AD/diallyl disulfide PT+ p = 0.011). 54/239 parabens PT+ had AD (22.6%), whilst 181/608 lanolin PT+ had AD (29.8%) (pG 0.05) Discussion: Frequency of contact allergy to haptens with both oral and skin exposure is reduced in AD patients compared to non-AD patients in direct contrast to food protein allergy. This decrease was not observed in lanolin, which is used only on the skin. Possible reasons for these results could be 1) confounding factors e.g. AD patients handle garlic less than non-AD patients, or 2) AD patients are very efficient at tolerising haptens, and this is in some way secondary to their atopic status, or 3) oral tolerance of haptens may in some way antagonise tolerance of proteins and contribute to the development of atopy (the hapten hypothesis). We note that the increase in atopy over the last 50 years also coincides with a period where processed food and milk, with chemical/hapten content, is used in western diets.",

Course of Integrated Medicine Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Dermatology, Oasaka, Japan. Background: Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated on binding to its ligand-collagen a component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the organs and is known to be constitutively expressed in the normal tissues such as the lungs, kidneys, colon, and brain. It has been reported that the tissue-infiltrating eosinophils expressed DDR1 and interaction between endogenous DDR1 on eosinophils and collagen in the ECM might affect eosinophil survival in the tissue microenvironment through NFK-B activation in Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) characterized by necrotizing granulomatous angitis with massive eosinophil infiltration, asthma, and hypereosinophilia. Patients and Methods: DDR1 expression on peripheral blood eosinophils from asthma patients, and healthy volunteers has been reported to be significantly lower than that from CSS patient. However little is known about the DDR1 expression and its significance in tissue infiltrating eosinophils in allergic diseases. Therefore, we analysed DDR1 expression by tissueinfiltrating eosinophils in allergic skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, drug eruption and Kimura's disease with eosinophil infiltration. Results and Conclusion: DDR1 was significantly expressed by eosinophils in the lesional skin of CSS, but not atopic dermatitis, drug eruption or Kimura's disease. Our current results indicate that DDR1 expression by eosinophils in the local inflammatory sites is specific for CSS and could be the disease marker in allergic skin diseases with eosinophil infiltration.Mechanisms of eosinophil survival and activation might be different between CSS and allergic skin disease such as atopic dermatitis.",

Methods: AD patients younger than 18 years old were recruited from the paediatric dermatology clinic of a university teaching hospital and AD severity evaluated with the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. Concentrations of serum total IgE, eosinophil count and plasma AD-associated chemokines (cutaneous T cell attracting cytokine, CTACK; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, TARC) were measured. Results: One hundred and seventeen Chinese children with AD (64 boys and 53 girls), with mean (SD) age of 10.7 (4.4) years, were recruited. Their mean (SD) overall SCORAD was 51. 1 (22.8) . % (defined as total serum IgE level divided by age-specific upper limit) correlated well with the extent and intensity of AD except for oozing/crusting which was significant only in the males. There was significant correlation for % with pruritus or sleep loss only in the females. 82 (70%) of patients reported history of allergic rhinitis and 35 (30%) reported history of asthma or hyperactive airway disease. In a subgroup of patients who had never had allergic rhinitis, asthma or urticaria (n = 26), log-transformed % correlated well with the objective SCORAD (Spearman's rho = 0.554, p = 0.003).Levels of IgE, CTACK, and TARC and eosinophil count differed significantly among patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. % correlated well with TARC (r = 0.50, p G 0.001) and eosinophil count (r = 0.41, p G 0.001) but not CTACK (r = 0.11, p = 0.270). The prediction of moderate-to-severe eczema by % gave an area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.65Y0.86, p = 0.004). An optimum positive predictive value of 94.2% was achieved with a cut-off point of % of 2.95, sensitivity of 75.0% and specificity of 66.7%. Conclusion: % correlates well with the objective clinical and serum TARC level, and may serve as an overall marker for disease severity. Furthermore, % of 2.95 predicts moderate-to-severe disease. Unlike the chemokines, Serum IgE measurement is inexpensive and readily available in most clinical service. IgE is not only a laboratory marker for atopy but also a parameter of disease severity.",

Introduction: Soy is one of the few foods that contain important levels of linoleic acid, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (O3FA). It is known that O3FA reduces the production of arachidonic acid derivates which are able to reduce chronic inflammatory response. Objective: To evaluate the association between dietary soy intake and the presence of skin allergic symptoms in adults. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 765 students from Centro Educativo Latinoamericano University in Rosario, randomly chosen, 638 females (83.4%) and 127 males (16.6%), aged from 17 to 65 years old (x = 21.42 T 4.18) . They answered questionnaires about urticaria/angioedema, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and about the frequency of soyfood intake. Results: Differences were found when the food intake was classified into two groups: A (never or less than once a month) and B (once or more than once a month, week or day). For soy-based mayonnaises and margarines intake, 48.1% of the subjects were found in group B and the prevalence of skin diseases within this group was significantly lower than in group A; for example atopic dermatitis: .5% and in this group the prevalence of angioedema symptoms (1.3%) was lower than in the rest of groups (5.9%) (OR = 0.22; IC:0.04Y0.96; pG0.05). The soyfood ingestion was significantly higher in male and men presented significantly less prevalence of the symptoms studied. The statistical significance remained the same after adjustment for sex and ingestion of histamine-releasing food. No differences were found between soy intake and urticaria symptoms. Conclusion: The results obtained allow us to estimate that the intake of a soy rich food, at least once a month, could protect against some skin disorders.",

Introduction: chronic urticaria is the most common cutaneous disorder seen in outpatient allergy clinics. There are a few reports associating house dust mite sensitivity with chronic urticaria. This study investigates the possible association between house dust mite sensitivity and chronic urticaria. Methods: In this study four groups of patients were enrolled. Group I: Chronic urticaria (35 subjects). Group II: allergic rhinitis(135 subjects). Group III: asthmatic patients (14 subjects).Group 4: allergic rhinitis +asthma(12 subjects). Group II, III and IV considered as positive controls. All of the patients underwent skin prick testing with antigens of the house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP) and Dermatophagoides farinae (DF), with positive and negative controls. Results: In Group I, 13/35 (37.1%): In group II 64/135(47.4%); In group III 5/ 14(35.7%) and in group IV 4/12(33.3%) patients had skin sensitivity to house dust mites .There were no statistical differences between prevalence of positive skin test to mite in four groups. Conclusion: we suggest a possible association of house dust mite sensitivity with chronic urticaria.",

Rationale: The role of intestinal microflora in children with allergic eczema dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) is still disputable, although a beneficial influence on AEDS course of certain intestinal bacteria, administered as probiotics has been described in intervention studies. The purpose was to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and sensitization and cytokines production in children with AEDS. Materials and Methods: A case-control study with 57 children (4Y7 years) having AEDS and 55 age-matched healthy control subjects was conducted. For differential diagnosis we used Skin Prick Test (SPT) with common allergens, total and specific IgE. IL-5, IL-10, +-IFN levels were assessed by ELISA. All patients had investigation of gut microflora. Results: In children with AEDS were found significantly low counts of Bifidobacterium comparing to healthy control subjects (10 5 Y10 6 vs 10 9 Y10 10 CFU/g) as well as Lactobacillus (10 5 vs 10 7 Y10 8 CFU/g) (pG0.05). At the same time atopic children presented high level of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium dificile, Candida albicans in investigated microflora profile. Furthermore AEDS children demonstrated positive SPT to common allergen (especially food allergen); increased level of total and food specific IgE (mostly -egg, milk, peanut, hazelnut). In this group were shown increased production of IL-5 to 192,3 T 6,1 pkg/ml (N = 74,3 T 3,3 pkg/ml); IL-10 to 153 T 9 pkg/ml (N = 5,8 T 0,25 pkg/ml) and decreased production of +-IFN to 241 T 6 pkg/ml (N = 331 T 35 pkg/ml) (p G0,05). Conclusion: This investigation demonstrated the relationship between perturbation in intestinal microbiota and IgE sensitization in children with AEDS. There is an augmentation of Th-2 type lymphocyte function reflected by increased IL-5 and IL-10 production in AEDS children. Disorder of the intestinal microflora might play a role in the onset of atopic eczema. self-healing blistering disorder of the skin caused by a small insect belonging to genus Paederus, family Staphylinidae, order Coleoptera. It appears on the skin by hemolymph of Paederus beetles. This study was undertaken to identify the dominant species of paederus beetles and to report the expose parts of the body in the study area. Methods: Peaderus beetles were collected by hand and UV black rays every month for entomological studies. For medical studies questionnaires were completed by physicians in health centers in the studied areas. Results: By this investigation, it was revealed that Paederus ilsae Bernhauer and paederus iliensis Coiffait are two species that were identified for the first time in the studied area. This research has revealed the 27.02%, 23.42%, 18.01%, 17.11% and 14.41% cases of linear dermatitis occurred in face, neck, eyes, hands and legs respectively in kazeron area. Furthermore, 42.6% of cases also had secondary infections later. Conclusion: Public awareness of how to avoid contact with the adult beetles is considered to be the best way to reduce the cases of linear dermatitis.",

Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by pruritus, inflammation, lichenifications, and typically distributed eczematous lesions. Environmental factors as well as allergens from various sources may trigger skin inflammation. The exact cause of AD is unknown, but immunological and psychological factors should be taken into account. We report a case of a 28-year old female suffering from atopic dermatitis with a history of recurrent episodes of pruritus, urticaria and facial angioedema starting 6-12 hours after eating dark chocolate pralines. With the elimination of milk chocolate and dark chocolate from the diet no more episodes occurred. White chocolate is well tolerated and consumed frequently. Methods: Skin prick tests to commercial extracts of common aeroallergens and food allergens were performed. Furthermore prick to prick tests using white chocolate, milk chocolate, dark chocolate (65% cocoa powder and 85% cocoa powder), and cocoa powder were carried out. Specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG4 levels to a large panel of purified food allergens from milk, egg, peanut, hazelnut, soy, peach, apple, celery, and chocolate extracts were determined by ELISA experiments. Results: Skin prick tests with commercial extracts were negative. IgE and IgG1 levels to various food allergens and chocolate extracts were not increased compared to non atopic individuals, whereas IgG4 levels to all tested allergens and chocolate extracts were significantly higher than in control sera. Prick to prick tests with chocolate brands revealed erythema with increasing intensities according to higher contents of cocoa powder. White chocolate (without cocoa powder) did not elicit any skin reactions. Conclusion: This case report illustrates the complexity of diagnosing adverse reactions to foods. Ingestion of dark chocolate elicits angioedema and AD, while white chocolate is tolerated. Even in the absence of allergen-specific IgE, an allergen-specific Th2 reactivity (high IgG4 levels) can be observed.",

Background: Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin. Contact dermatitis is a localized rash or irritation of the skin caused by contact with a foreign substance. Substances that cause contact dermatitis in many people include \"poisonous\" plants such as poison ivy, certain foods, some metals, cleaning solutions, detergents, cosmetics, perfumes, industrial chemicals, and latex rubber. Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IVa1 T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity. Case Report: A 26-year-old female with clinical signs of persistent allergic rhinitis (sneezing, itching and rhinorrhea). She presented a severe eruption with intense itching after using her new perfume. Clinical aspect of skin lesions were: erythema, papules and vesicles on the neck and chest with augmentation of symptoms after solar exposure. The manifestations have begun after 24 hours of exposure to the new perfume. Results: Skin prick tests revealed an atopic patient with sensitization to Alternaria. Skin patch tests with european standards to cosmetic fragrances (fragrance mix, balsam of Peru), cosmetic preservatives (paraben mix, quaternium) and other cosmetic ingredients (colophony, thiomerosol, ethylenediamine, formaldehyde) and her own perfume revealed late sensitization (72 hours) to her perfume and fragrance mix. We recomanded to avoid contact with known allergens and treatment with H1 anihistamine and topical steroids. Conclusion: The patient with contact dermatitis may be very uncomfortable and have poor quality of life. The best treatment is to identify and avoid the substances that may have caused the allergic reaction.",

Guramishvili Pediatric clinic (2006Y2007). All patients fulfilled the criteria (at least 3 major and 3 minor) for diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (Hannifin and Rajka). The children were divided into 2 groups. The first group (20 children) for 8 weeks received probiotic (Lactobacterine containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and BifidumBacterine containing Bifidumbacterin,) and emollient ointment the second group (18 children) only emollient ointment. The SCORAD index was used to evaluate severity and extent of AD at the end of the study of disease. Objective signs -spread of lesions, intensity (erythema, edema, oozing, excoriation, lichenification, and xerosis) and subjective signs (pruritus and sleeping disorders) were assessed. The mean SCORAD index before treatment was 45, 9. After the 4 week as well as 8 week treatment was founded improvement of clinical (SCORAD index decreases) in both groups. At the same time the reduction in the SCORAD index was significant in the probiotic group. After the 8 week of study 65% of children had a better SCORAD index then baseline, comparing to the second group improvement was in 43%. So, we can conclude that supplementation with probiotics is beneficial in improvement severity of AD in children.",

Introduction: Lichen planus an uncommon skin complaint, thought to be due to an abnormal immune reaction provoked by a viral infection (such as hepatitis C),or a drug. Inflammatory cells seem to mistake the skin cells as foreign and attack them. In 80Y85% of cases it clears from skin surfaces within 18 months but when affecting the mouth may persist longer. Methods: The classical lichen planus is characterized by shiny, flat-topped, firm papules varying from pin point size e.g.guttate to larger than a centimeter. The lesion had shinny flat-topped, firm papules varying from pinpoint to much larger sized lesions. In the study concerned 2 individuals were included. Both had been medicated with different empirical therapies. There was a remitting/ relapsing course patients were treated with a combination regimen of anti histaminic & gradual lowered dilutions of dust mite therapeutic extracts over a period of 4 months. The remission of the lesions were evident in the form of a reduction in the intensity of itchiness, ooze & redness. The final outcome was evident in the form of scar formation. Results: In the ongoing trials the therapeutic response was dramatic in female than in the male patients. Conclusion: Lichen planus a chronic intractable condition with multiple causes some times with a diagnostic dilemma.

Background: Tacrolimus ointment is used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in adult and pediatric patients worldwide. However, no studies have been reported on the efficacy and safety in a large population of Asian patients with AD. The aim of this overview is to survey the assessments of the efficacy and safety conducted in the patients across 8 Asian areas, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. Methods: We analyzed the combined data of patients with AD from studies conducted in the Asian areas. Adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe AD were enrolled. Adult patients applied 0.1% or 0.03% tacrolimus ointment and pediatric patients applied 0.03% twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response (PGE). Other evaluations included Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI), Percent Body Surface Area affected (%BSA), Patient's Assessment of Itch and Patient's Assessment of Overall Response, and each category of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and children's DLQI (CDLQI). Results: More than 800 patients were included in these Asian studies. Success based on PGE was observed in 83.6% of all patients. The improvement in Patient's Assessment of Overall Response was similar to PGE. Percent BSA affected, EASI and Patient's Assessment of Itch improved at weeks 1, 2, and at the end of treatment. The decrease of Patient's Assessment of Itch was greatest compared with decrease of %BSA affected and EASI. All DLQI subscales (Symptoms and feelings, Daily activities, Leisure, Work and school, Personal relationships, and Treatment) improved, and also the subscales of CDLQI (Symptoms and feelings, Leisure, School or holidays, Personal relationships, Sleep and Treatment) improved at the end of treatment. In particular, Symptoms and feelings showed a marked decrease in both age groups. In subscales of CDLQI, Sleep also had marked improvement. Improvement in the PGE was associated with the decrease in %BSA, EASI and Patient's Assessment of Itch, and also with DLQI/CDLQI. Adverse events frequently reported were skin burning and pruritus at the application site. The incidence of skin burning was lower in pediatric patients than that in adults. No serious adverse events were reported from the studies. Conclusion: Tacrolimus ointment is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with AD in Asian countries.",

University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Department of Dermatology, Kitakyushu, Japan. Background: Epinastine belongs to the second generation of antihistamines and also possesses anti-inflammatory or anti-allergic properties in cutaneous as well as systemic allergy, including mast cell stabilization, suppression of costimulatory molecule expression, inhibition of eosinophils chemotaxis and granulocytes accumulation, and suppression of cytokine and chemokine production. In Japan, systemic preparation of epinastine has been approved for not only atopic dermatitis but also pruritic psoriasis vulgaris. Skin is a wellorchestrated immune organ where epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) function as antigen-presenting cells and keratinocytes serve as producers of various cytokines and chemokines. We have previously reported that epinastine suppresses the production of Th1 chemokines and RANTES/CCL5 by keratinocytes. Since keratinocytes and LCs are the main epidermal sources of Th1 and Th2 chemokines, respectively, the effect of epinastine on the Th2 chemokine production by LCs is an issue to be clarified. Methods: We prepared epidermal cell suspensions from BALB/c mice and enriched them for LCs. The LC-enriched epidermal cells were cultured with epinastine for 48 h, and the expression levels of Th2 chemokines, TARC/ CCL17 and MDC/CCL22, were assessed by real-time PCR analysis. Results: The expression of CCL17 was depressed by epnastine as low as 10-6 M, and CCL22 expression was also inhibited by epinastine 10-7 M or more in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our study suggests that epinastine exerts not only an antihistaminic action but also a downmodulatory effect on Th2 cell migration toward the epidermis by inhibiting LC production of Th2 chemokines. Taken together with the previous finding that epinastine downregulates Th1 chemokine production by keratinocytes, we conclude that this antihistamic drug has an inhibitory potential for migration of both Th1 and Th2 cells in the skin.",

A twicedaily concoction of an ancestral formula containing five herbs has been found to be beneficial in an open study. The five herbs include Flos lonicerae (Jinyinhua), Herba menthae (Bohe), Cortex moutan (Danpi), Rhizoma atractylodis (Cangzhu) and Cortex phellodendri (Huangbai). We demonstrated that there was no corticosteroid (CS) or CS related compound in this formulation. Objective: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the concoction in children with AD. Methods: Following a 2-week run-in period, children with longstanding moderate-to-severe AD were randomised to receive a 12-week treatment with twice daily dosing of three capsules of either TCHM or placebo. The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score; Children Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), allergic rhinitis score, requirement for topical corticosteroid and oral antihistamine were assessed before, and at week 4, 8, 12 and 16 after treatment. Adverse events, tolerability, haematological and biochemical parameters were monitored during the study. Results: Eighty-five children with AD were recruited. Over 12 weeks, the mean SCORAD fell from 58.3 to 49.7 in the TCHM group (n = 42; p = 0.003), and 56.9 to 46.9 in the placebo group (n = 43; p = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the scores at the corresponding time points between the two groups. The CDLQI in TCHM treated patients were significantly improved compared with patients receiving placebo at end of the 3-month treatment and 4 weeks after stopping therapy (p = 0.008 and 0.059, respectively). The total amount of topical corticosteroid used was also significantly reduced by one-third in the TCHM group (p=0.024). No serious adverse effects were observed between the groups. Analysis of biochemical data also revealed no significant change in the IgE levels, haematological (complete blood counts, eosinophil counts) and biochemical (electrolytes, renal and liver functions) parameters monitored. No patient complained that the capsule was unpalatable. Conclusion: The TCHM concoction is efficacious in improving quality of life and reducing topical corticosteroid usage in children with moderate-to-severe AD. The formulation was palatable, well tolerated and can probably be used as an adjunct treatment for children with refractory AD.",

Course of Integrated Medicine Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Dermatology, Osaka, Japan. Background: Mast cell-derived histamine is known to act on dermal fibroblasts and contribute to formation of an intractable chronic allergic dermatitis. Although this fibrotic event may also occur in other organs such as nasal mucosa, no direct evidence has been reported as to whether responsiveness to histamine by fibroblasts derived from different organs is of the same intensity. Furthermore, while histamine (H1R) blocker has been proved to be effective for alleviation of the symptoms of allergic diseases, its ability to affect histamine-induced tissue remodeling has not yet been clarified. Objective: Our aim was to study the effect of H1R-blockers on histamineinduced tissue remodeling. Methods: A macro array assay was used for a comprehensive analysis of histamine-induced gene expression by normal human fibroblasts. Fibroblasts derived from skin or nasal mucosa were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of histamine, and the synthesis of type 1 collagen was measured by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA assay. To determine the effect of the H1R blocker, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and emedastine difumarate were investigated in this assay. Results: Histamine induced various kinds of fibrogenic molecules from fibroblasts. Increased type 1 collagen expression was observed in fibroblasts treated with high-dose (j4 to j6 logM) and low-dose (j12logM) histamine. This histamine-induced type 1 collagen synthesis was effectively diminished by emedastine difumarate. Conclusion: We found that the expression of these fibroblast-derived genes are regulated differently by different concentrations of histamine, and that the robustness of the inhibitory action of H1R blockers is different for skinderived and nasal mucosa-derived fibroblasts. We believe that our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of histamineinduced tissue remodeling, and provide information useful for the management of refractory allergic dermatitis.",

Background and Purpose: Fexofenadine hydrochloride (FEX), a secondgeneration antihistamine, is used for the treatment of both allergic diseases and inflammatory skin reactions and successful results are reported. The primarily therapeutic mode of action of FEX is generally believed to be owing to its suppressive effect on effector cell activation, which responsible for the development of allergic inflammation. Recently, neuropeptide such substance P (SP) attracts attention as the essential factors that trigger, exacerbate or modulate allergic skin reactions. However, the influence of FEX on neuropeptide-induced inflammatory skin reaction is not fully understood. Methods: NC/Nga mice (8-weeks of age, female) were received repeated local application of 2,4,6-Trinitrochlorbenzene (TNCB) to provoke chronic cutaneous inflammation. FEX at a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg was orally administered into mice once a day for 2 weeks from either 1 day before or 1 week after the application of TNCB. The number of scratching for 5 min was counted 30 min after the final FEX administration. After counting the number of scratching, the SP content in skin tissues and serum IgE levels were examined by ELISA. Results: Repeated local application of TNCB induced itching skin lesions, together with an increase in the levels of SP and IgE. Treatment of mice with FEX caused significant decrease in the levels of SP, but not IgE. Scratching behavior was also decreased significantly by the treatment of mice with FEX: the number of scratching in non-treated mice was 80 T 13 and that in FEXtreated mice was 48 T 9. Conclusion: These results may suggest that FEX inhibits the scratching behavior observed in chronic cutaneous inflammation through suppression of SP production in the skin lesions.",

Materials and Methods: The group of patients consisted of 156 AD RP patients. Intradermal tests with Staphylococcal allergen and prick tests with Der. pteronissinus and Der. farinae allergens were carried out in all AD RP patients. Skin testing was carried out in all AD RP patients in remission period. Specific IgE levels to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B as well as to Der. pteronissinus and Der. farinae in sera of AD RP patients were measured with UniCap 100 system, Phadia. 28 AD RP patients with positive skin tests and positive specific IgE to HDM and staphylococcal enterotoxin B received specific immunotherapy (SIT) with staphylococcal and HDM allergovaccines. Subcutaneous injections of allergen and vaccine were made daily, in increasing doses. The duration of the main course of specific immunotherapy was 10Y14 days and then one maintenance dosage every 2 weeks; further observation period lasted 12 months. Results: We observed sensitization to HDM in 83,9% AD RP patients, to S. aureus in 66,6% patients, both to HDM and S. aureus in 63,5% patients. There was positive effect of SIT with HDM and staphylococcal vaccine. After 1,6,12 months of the further observation period index SCORAD decreased in 26,1%, 58,3%, 44,8% accordingly. There were no exacerbations of RP in 42,8% of patients. The topical corticosteroids and antibiotics decreased significantly. Index of respiratory symptoms decreased significantly too.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been recently suggested to be one of the most crucial immunoregulatory cytokines of Th1/Th2 imbalance in AD. In this study we assessed the anti-inflammatory effect of EGCG by its topical application to the AD skin lesions in NC/Nga mouse model, and then we determined whether this effect of EGCG is mediated by immunoregulatory cytokines including MIF. Methods: Induction of AD skin lesions was made by painting Dermatophagoides pteronissinus extract (DPE) onto the surface of each ear of NC/Nga mice. One group was then treated with EGCG solution, another group with vehicle, and the other group sham-treated for 4 weeks. To compare the clinical signs of the 3 groups, we measured ear thickness every week. At the last day, all the ears were excised and prepared for the following procedures; 1) hematoxyline and eosin stain, 2) immunohistochemistry for MIF, TNF-! and IFN-+ 3) quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for MIF, TNF-!, IFN-+, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-12. Blood sampling was also performed for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for MIF and total IgE in serum. Results: As compared to vehicle treatment, topical application of EGCG significantly reduced the ear thickness (pG0.05). Likewise, the histological grading of chronic inflammation including epidermal hyperplasia and mononuclear cell infiltration into the dermis was also significantly decreased on the skin lesions of EGCG group. On the immunohistochemical staining, in comparison with vehicle treatment, EGCG treatment significantly diminished the expression of TNF-!, IFN-+ as well as MIF on the lesions (p G 0.05). Similarly, the mRNA expression of MIF, TNF-!, IFN-+, IL-2 and IL-12, but not IL-4 of the lesions was significantly down-regulated by EGCG treatment (p G 0.05). Serum MIF and total IgE production was also significantly reduced with the EGCG. treatment (p G 0.05). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that topical application of EGCG could reduce the chronic inflammation of AD lesions by suppressing a series of immunoregulatory cytokines including MIF. Taken together, it is suggested that topical application of EGCG can be a potential therapeutic modality in AD.",

The underlying cause of HIES is unknown and the management of the patient is difficult, the general goals are to control pruritus, eczema, and to prevent infections. We report a patient with typical features of HIES and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, in whom anti-IgE monoclonal therapy for allergic manifestations could be an effective therapeutic alternative. Methods: A 29-year-old woman of non-consanguineous parentage presented with moderate asthma and severe atopic dermatitis since early infancy. She had a history of recurrent respiratory infections, delay of shedding of primary teeth and slight facial dysmorphia. She had persistently elevated serum IgE levels (3000 kU/L). She suffered relapses of multiple discrete and confluent erythematous scaly papules and plaques with follicular prominence over face, trunk and limbs, with lichenification and warm hypersensitive skin, which limited her activities of daily living. In 1999, she was diagnosed of HCV infection. Later on, she developed unusual autoimmune associations: haemolitic anaemia, alopecia universalis and autoinmune hypothyroidism. The rash had been treated with antihistamine drugs and topical steroids, with poor response. Given the high levels of serum IgE, she was given Omalizumab therapy in high dose (450 mg sc) and every 15 days schedule, monitoring IgE, IgG4 levels, hemogram and biochemical analyses. Results: The patient improved her current symptoms of asthma since the first dose of Omalizumab and two months after the eczema severity decreased to a mild form. The patient cleared almost all her skin lesions although light lichenification areas persisted in flexures, improved xerosis, lowered itching and suffered no relapses. Serum IgE level persisted elevated and there were no change in the biochemical analyses. She did not present any side effects. Conclusion: Therapy with anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies was found to be well-tolerated and effective. Although, current knowledge and therapeutic options in HIES are limited and with variable success, anti-IgE monoclonal therapy for allergic manifestations seems to be an effective and safe therapeutical alternative, even more as a steroid sparing agent considering her HCV infection.",

            "text": "Background: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic cutaneous inflammatory disease mediated by type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. High IgE serum levels are commonly found and correlated with the severity of AD. Treatment of moderate-severe cases included phototherapy, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous immunoglobulin with variable results. Omalizumab, humanized monoclonal antibodies bind to free serum IgE and decrease the levels of its high affinity receptor. It has been successfully used in allergy asthma, rhinitis,allergic reactions to certain foods and drugs,latex and insect bites. The experience in the treatment of AD is limited and controversial. We report the preliminary results on 3 AD patients who received anti-IgE treatment. Methods: 3 adult patients(aged 29Y44) with severe refractory AD and high IgE levels9700kU/L(5.720Y12.310kU/L), were treated with omalizumab (Xolair, 450mg/kg subcutaneously every 2 weeks), 2 patients during 6 months and one patient is now on the third month of treatment. All patients had allergic rhinitis, one of them has current symptoms of asthma and other one has history of asthma. They were previously treated with topical and systemic steroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors and cyclosporine, with partial control of the symptoms. All patients were informed this was an offlabel use and the side effects profile. Results: All the patients experienced any improvement during the treatment. After two months the eczema severity decreased in all of them, from severe to moderate-mild forms. Two patients stopped all medications either antihistaminic drugs and only one of them continues taking cyclosporine. One patient obtained partial response, with clearing of lesions, lower itching and was able to restart sport; other patient suffered autolimited relapses and did not require other therapies, and finally reach complete clearance at 6-months; the last one improves her skin lesions and asthma symptoms at 2-months. This later patient diminished the dose of cyclosporine (200 to 50 mg/day). All the biochemical analyses remained normal. None of them suffered adverse reactions. Conclusion: Omalizumab did not systematically diminished serum IgE levels, but achieve significantly clinical improvement even on monotherapy at 6 months. On the other hand, Omalizumab showed a safe profile and might be a promising treatment in those patients in whom systemic therapy has not been successful. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease whose pathophysiology is the product of complex interaction between susceptibility genes, host environments, infectious agents, defects in skin barrier and immunologic responses. Basic treatment of AD consists in topical emollients, topical and systemic CS and immunosuppressive drugs, antihistamines, phototherapy. Adjunctive HdIVIg for resistant AD may offer a useful approach, as suggested by small number of uncontrolled trials and case reports, via a number of immunomodulatory effects. Most patients with AD are colonized with S aureus and experience exacerbation after infection with this organism. In these cases treatment with antibiotics can result in reduction of skin disease. We signal the case of a 46-y-old man affected by pollens-mitesallergic rhinitis from adolescence, suffering from severe AD for 7 years with typical signs of lesional chronicity with lichenified plaques and fissuration on face and neck, upper arms and back, palm and dorsa of hands. To our attention, typical phenomena of microbial colonization were evident.",

Group I Y 34 patients who were treated with laser and traditional therapy, and a control group of 33 patients, treated with the traditional drug therapy. The positive dynamic of the studied parameters were registered with the application of different treatment methods; however, it was at its highest under the influence of laser therapy. Thus, in the main group the content of neutrophile leucocytes recovered to the normal quantity and dynamic of the above mentioned parameters was on average 48% higher than in the control group. Hence, this newly developed combined method of treating atopic dermatitis has been proven to have a desensitizing and anti-allergic effect, which is indicated by the recovery of the functional activity of neutrophiles. Background: Because of chronic course and highly disfigured skin lesions, atopic dermatitis (AD) has a substantial impact on quality of life (QOL). Moreover, previous studies assessing the financial cost of AD have shown that it represents a notable economic burden. However, little has been known about QOL and economic burden in Korean patients with AD. Methods: A questionnaire specifically designed by our clinical experience was used to determine how AD affects the lives of the patients and/or their parents. 66 and 39 parents completed the self-administrated questionnaires, including the questions on multidimensional aspects of QOL. They were also surveyed to find how much money they have spent in the treatment of AD during the last 6 months. All of the QOL scores are linearly transformed to 0Y100 scale, with 100 indicating the worst QOL, and 0 the most favorable. In addition, for each patient the disease severity was evaluated by using SCORAD index. Results: The QOL data revealed that AD had significantly negative effects on QOL through all aspects of life including daily living activities (37.4), psychological status (29.7) and social functioning (23.1). The average of the total QOL score was 30.1. The QOL scores significantly increase in proportion to the increasing severity of AD (pG0.0001). With regard to daily living activities, a major stress-causing factor was restriction on cosmetics use (44.5) and choice of foods (40.6) or clothes (36.7) as well as concern about exposure of their skin (41.2). For psychological status, 89% of patients reported that they feel deeply nervous about the likelihood of their offspring having AD in future (54.5). Regarding social functioning, it was told that AD patients had difficulties in making relationship with someone (26.4) and were less interested in the opposite sex (24.7). AD parents also had high level of stress associated with modifying lifestyles (33.8) and keeping their children from scratching (28.2). The estimated cost related to AD has the positive correlation with the severity of AD, widely ranging from 60,000 won to 1,990,000 won per patient a month. Of importance, the average direct medical cost was 77,000 won, corresponding to only 29% of the total, while the indirect cost represents 71% of the total with average cost of 189,000 won. Conclusion: These results suggest that AD has a significant impact on the various components of QOL as well as economic burden in Korean patients and their parents. Background: Extensive evidence has been accumulated on the role of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in allergic diseases. Although physical exercise has been associated, in animal models, with an increased NGF expression, no data are available about its effects on NGF in humans. Aim: To study NGF serum levels in top athletes, a population sample in which allergic diseases and neuroimmune disorders Y such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)Yare reported with a significant increased prevalence. Methods: 103 male soccer players (mean age 26.1) from five first division teams were studied for allergic diseases trough an original specific questionnaire (AQUAc2007), history, physical examination, skin prick tests and/or Phadiatop. Sera were taken in all athletes, at different time periods, and stored at j70-C for NGF determination trough a double-antibody ELISA. Data from a pilot sample of 36 athletes and 15 non-allergic, sedentary, matched controls are presented. Results: The prevalence of allergy in soccer players was 47.8%. In spite of a high intra-and inter-individual variability of values, possibly due to the different training loads during the soccer season, mean NGF serum levels were significantly higher in soccer players than in controls (384.19 ng/ml +/j 298.41 ng/ml vs 128.0 ng/ml +/j 10.0 ng/ml; p G0.05). The NGF serum levels in athletes were increased independently from the presence of allergy. Conclusion: Our study confirms the high prevalence of allergic diseases in athletes. The increased NGF serum levels in allergic soccer players are consistent with the role of this neurotrophin in allergic inflammation. This is the first report of increased serum levels of NGF related to intense physical activity in humans.",

However up today the precise and convincing data on prevalence and features of current allergic diseases in elite Russian sportsmen are absent. The purpose of the present research is to study prevalence, features of allergen spectrum and structure of allergic diseases in elite sportsmen. The skin prick-tests with different groups of allergens, the estimation of total IgE end IgA, IgM, IgG in blood serum, the challenge bronchial tests with physical exercise are used in modern clinical, laboratory and allergic research methods including gathering allergic, the pharmacological and food anamnesis. Screening of 319 elite sportsmen was carried out (fencing, sport and art gymnastics, dzudo, softball, water polo, volleyball, figure skating, hockey on a grass, rowing on a canoe, freestyle, biathlon, a youth soccer team, football). The analysis of carried out research has shown the following. 23,5 % (75) sportsmen have clinical attributes of allergic disease: allergic dermatitis -16%, allergic urticaria -17,3%, allergic rhinitis -30,7%, pollen-allergic rhinitis -17,3%, bronchial asthma -5,3%, drug allergy -0,94%, food allergy -0,63%. Increase of total IgE level in blood serum has been revealed in sportsmen with allergic diseases (23%) from 130 to 1000 ME/ml. Immune status analysis demonstrated the decrease of IgG and IgA level and increase of IgM level in elite sportsmen without any connection to atopy. In 94,5% of sportsmen allergy was diagnosed for the first time. Obtained data testifies widespread of allergic diseases among elite sportsmen and allergic diseases hypo-diagnostics. The hypo-diagnostics of allergic diseases results in late prescription of adequate therapy and restricts sport achievements.

Background: Bronchial asthma is characterized by lower airway inflammation and remodelling. Anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids provides the mainstay of asthma therapy together with bronchodilation induced by short and long-acting inhaled $2-agonists. Lower airway fibroblasts may play a critical role in airway inflammation and remodelling suggesting they might represent an important target for the major antiasthmatic drugs.",

Methods: Fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of proinflammatory and proliferative stimuli, beclomethasone dipropionate, salbutamol and formoterol. The effects of drugs on cell proliferation were ascertained by 3Hthymidine incorporation. CD90 and CD44 expression were detected by flow cytometry and fibronectin secretion using an ELISA technique. Results: This study showed that beclomethasone dipropionate alone has significant anti-proliferative effects on lung fibroblasts treated with bFGF while LABAs or SABAs by themselves did not show any significant effect in the different cultures. The combination of BDP with formoterol or salbutamol strengthens these effects. CD44 and CD90 expression and fibronectin production were modulated by proinflammatory and proliferative stimuli; the addition of the drugs brought them back near to the basal level. Conclusion: From this in vitro study we can conclude that beclomethasone dipropionate, when combined with salbutamol or formoterol, exhibits enhanced anti remodelling activity in bronchial fibroblasts, providing new insights on the additive effects of inhaled corticosteroids and $2-agonists for asthma therapy.",

Background: belongs to the galectin family that exhibits affinity for $ galactosides. Gal-9 has a variety of biological activities, however its role in allergic inflammation is unknown. We evaluated the effect of a stable form of the human protein on allergic airway inflammation in a mite allergeninduced asthma model. Methods: Human stable gal-9 was given by intravenous injection to mice during antigen challenge. The effect of gal-9 on airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) was then evaluated. Results: Gal-9 reduced AHR as well as T helper type 2 (Th2)-associated airway inflammation. Furthermore, administration of gal-9 as well as anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody inhibited the infiltration of peripheral blood Th2 cells into the airway. Interestingly, gal-9 directly bound the CD44 adhesion molecule and inhibited interactions with hyaluronan (HA). Consistent with the concept that CD44-HA interactions mediate the migration of T cells into the lung, gal-9 blocked CD44-dependent adhesion of BW5147 mouse T cells to HA. Conclusion: We conclude that gal-9 inhibits allergic inflammation of the airway and AHR by modulating CD44 dependent leukocyte recognition of the extracellular matrix.",

Even though a number of medications or treatments for the disease are available, the demand for a rather mild and preventive medication using the natural products such as Chinese traditional medicine is increasing, especially, in a number of Asian countries. Artemisia carpillaris is a perennial herb easily found around the temperate Asian regions including the entire Korean peninsula. It is called BInjin[ in Korea and BYin Chin[ or BYin Chen Hao[ in China, which is traditionally used for the treatment of liver diseases and also applied to some allergic symptoms such as hives or rash. In order to identify an anti-allergic principle of the plant, we have isolated a water-soluble glycoside fraction of smaller than 1kDa and determined its biological activities on an allergic asthma model animal. Methods: We have investigated suppressive effects of the fraction on an ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma in BALB/c mice and studied the cellular and molecular mechanisms of its anti-allergic activity. Results: A water-soluble fraction of Artemisia carpillaris significantly reduced the pulmonary eosinophilia and the Th2 cytokine expressions such as IL4 and IL5 in the lungs as well as serum IgE levels. The surface expression of the CD11c and class II MHC on the lung dendritic cells was also reduced by the treatment of the fraction, indicating that the fraction also modulates the dendritic cell development in lung tissues. Conclusion: Considering that the pulmonary dendritic cells are crucial in the differentiation of Th2 cells and the production of IL4 and IL5 in lung tissues and that the cytokines are important in the IgE antibody production and eosinophil infiltration, the fraction appears to include an anti-allergic principle modulating the Th2 differentiation and the resulting allergic asthma development.",

Objective: To determine association between ADRB2 polymorphisms and asthma phenotypes in Thai patients. Methods and Materials: One hundred and thirty asthmatic patients were genotyped for ArgGly16 and GlnGlu27 polymorphisms. Patients' demographic, disease severity, pulmonary function test results and medication used were collected. Haplotype with unknown phase was inferred using EM algorithm method. ANOVA was applied to compare means among groups. Results: Prevalence of Arg16 and Gln27 alleles were 56.9% and 91.2%, respectively. Linkage disequilibrium coefficient between the two SNPs was 0.36. Three haplotypes were inferred, which were Arg-Gln, Gly-Gln, and Gly-Glu with frequencies of 148 (56.9%), 89 (34.2%), and 23 (8.6%). Mean percentage of predicted FEV1 for these corresponding haplotypes were 73.5 (SD = 16.3), 72.4 (SD = 17.4), and 80.7 (13.1), respectively. Although the means were not statistical different (p = 0.258), the predicted FEV1 of Gly-Glu was 6%Y9% higher than the rest haplotypes. Number of hospitalization and emergency visit were also lower in GlnGlu27 than GlnGln27 genotypes (i.e., 0% versus 11.9%, p = 0.089 for hospitalization; 4.5 % versus 18.8 %, p = 0.084 for visiting emergency). Finally, inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting $2-agonist (ICS/LABA) usage was significantly lower in patients with GlnGlu27 than patients with GlnGln27 (i.e., 50% versus 76.6%; p = 0.042). Conclusion: Presence of Glu27 allele in Thai asthmatic patients is associated with better parameters of asthma severity, including higher percentage of predicted FEV1, less hospitalization and emergency department visit during the past year and significant lower amount of ICS/LABA usage.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important mediator of airway inflammation and remodeling in asthma. We aimed to explore whether VEGF is expressed at elevated levels in airways with asthma or EB and associated with pulmonary function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in children. Methods: One hundred seventeen asthmatic children, 77 children with EB and 84 healthy controls (mean age, 8.9 years) were enrolled in the study. Sputum supernatants were collected, and VEGF and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were measured. We performed pulmonary function tests and methacholine challenge tests, while measuring total eosinophil count, serum total IgE and ECP in all subjects. Results: Asthmatic children had significantly higher levels of VEGF in induced sputum (1.82 T 0.55 log pg/mL) compared to children with EB (1.50 T 0.53 log pg/mL; p = .00165) or healthy controls (1.48 T 0.48 log pg/mL; p = .00034). A positive significant correlation was found between FEV1/FVC and sputum VEGF (r = 0.257; p = .006), whereas no significant correlations were found between sputum VEGF and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, sputum eosinophil count or sputum ECP. Sputum eosinophil count showed higher levels in children with asthma or EB than in controls (p G 0.001). Sputum ECP also demonstrated higher levels in children with asthma or EB than in controls (p = .044, p = .001, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that sputum VEGF might be a valuable marker to distinguish asthma from EB in children with chronic cough. It is also suggested that VEGF would affect the airway inflammation contributing to airway remodeling which may reflect in FEV1/FVC.",

Results: 21 steroid naive and 77 patients previously treated with ICS were included in our study. In steroid naive patient group 72% of patients were classified as asthmatics with eosinophilic phenotype and 28% with noneosinophilic phenotype. In ICS treatment group 39% were classified as eosinophilic and 61% as non-eosinophilic asthmatics. Patient demographic data and ICS dose was similar. In patients with non-eosinophilic asthma we found significantly higher relative and absolute sputum neutrophil count, asthma symptom score and $2-agonist use (p G 0.05). There was no significant difference between FEV1 83.1 T 18.1% vs. 87.6 T 25.6% and 90.1 T 20.7% vs. 96,3 T 12.5% in steroid naive and ICS treated patients respectively; p90.05) and lgPD20 Mch (j 1.343 T 0.765 vs. j 1.894 T 0.733 mg and j 0.729 T 0.702 vs. j 1.462 T 1.023 mg in steroid naive and ICS treated patients respectively; p90.05).",

Methods: Thirty five female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into a remodeling group and a treatment group (omalizumab group), with 10 BALB/ c mice in each group. The mice were sensitized by ovalbumin (OVA), and only the omalizumab group was treated with omalizumab. The number of total cells and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were counted. Light and electronic microscope were used to detect the pathologic histology and morphologic change. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to measure IL-4, L-5, IL-13, and TGF-beta (2) mRNAs in the lung. Results: The numbers of total cells and eosinophils in BALF of the remodeling group were (5.7 T 1.3) x 10(5)/ml and 2.43 T 0.18, while those of the treatment group were (4.1 T 1.4) x 10(5)/ml and 1.67 T 0.23, respectively, the difference being significant (P G 0.05). Histological and electronic microscopic examination showed extensive airway inflammation, notably accumulation of significant numbers of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the remodeling group. Other features including prominent proliferation of airway epithelial cells protruded like fingers, increased thickness of smooth muscle, hyperplasia of connective tissue, goblet cell hyperplasia and a marked increase in airway mucus secretion with mucus plugging and extensive collagen deposition around the airways were also noted in the remodeling group. In the treatment group, the inflammation was significantly decreased, with decreased production of mucus, decreased collagen and granule of mucus around airway, less proliferation of airway epithelium, smooth muscle hypertrophy and airway spasm. In situ hybridization showed that the expression of IL-13 mRNA and TGF-beta (2) mRNA in the lung oQf the remodeling group were 22 T 9 and 18 T 3 respectively, while those of the treatment group were 16 T 5 and 9 T 4. Conclusions: Omalizumab could effectively inhibit airway remodeling and decrease in the expression of IL-13 mRNA and TGF-beta (2) mRNA as well as IL-4 mRNA and IL-5 mRNA in the lung in asthma.",

The chronic allergic inflammation in the bronchial tree leads to the tissue injury, which results in the modification of its structure and releasing intracellular autoantigens. It was discovered IgG -autoantibodies to DNA and bronchial endothelium cells antigens in patients with bronchial asthma (BA). Goal: to determine the content of IgE and IgG4-autoantibodies (Ab) to some tissue antigens in patients with atopic BA different degrees of severity. Materials and Methods: We identified IgE-autoAb and IgG4-autoAb with ELISA to the following tissue antigens: epithelial keratin, III and VI collagen types, myelin basic protein (MBP), elastin and myosin (Sigma, USA) using specific IgE and IgG4 reference sets BDr. Fooke[ (Germany). It was studied serum samples of 64 adult asthmatic patients and 25 healthy individuals the same age. Results: The level of IgE-autoAb determined from control subjects was taken us for the average homeostatic norms and it was 1.5 T 0.07 IU/ml. Compared to them, in patients with easy and middle BA was noted reliable elevation of IgE-autoAb to keratin (13.7 T 4.3 IU/ml), collagen III and VI types (4.4 T 2.1 IU/ml, 6.8 T 3.2 IU/ml), elastin (4.9 T 2.4 IU/ml) and myosin (18.21 T 11.5 IU/ml). In patients with severe asthma were raised autoAb only to elastin (2.2 T 0.7 IU/ml), collagen type III (1.7 T 0.2 IU/ml) and myosin (7.5 T 3.1 IU/ ml). At the same time, increased total IgE correlated with IgE-autoAb to elastin and myosin (r = 0.68 and r = 0.45, respectively). IgG4 auto-Ab were also determined in the 35 serum samples of severe and middle asthmatic subjects and in the serum of 25 healthy people. Its normal average value was 2380 T 89.5 ng/ml. The level of IgG4-autoAB to all tissue antigens in asthmatic patients was a 1.5 times higher than in healthy controls. We also revealed significant negative correlation between IgG4 and IgE-autoAB to elastin (r = j0,7), III collagen type (r = j0,56), MBP (r = j0, 9) . So the data indicate that IgE and IgG4-autoreactivity contributes to the development of chronic inflammation in patients with atopic BA and needs to be further investigated.",

            "text": "Background: Exacerbation of bronchial asthma was characterized by increased airway responsiveness induced by lower airway inflammation and resultant airway obstruction. Small airways are known to be the main area of obstruction which causes limitation of airflow, but inflammatory change during exacerbation occurs in entire airway including large airway. We evaluated the changes of internal diameter of large airway during and after exacerbation. Methods: High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function test were done as soon as possible after admission in patients with exacerbation of asthma and follow up studies were done after improvement of symptoms and discharge. With HRCT scanned images during exacerbation, internal diameters of large airway were measured consecutively from right main to right subsegmental bronchus and measurement was repeated after discharge at the same level and angle of scanned bronchus. Results: Ten patients (male 5, mean age 43 [range 19Y64]) completed studies. Pulmonary function was markedly improved after treatment of exacerbation; mean FVC from 2.93 T 0.82 L to 3.72 T 0.64 L (p = 0.001) and mean FEV1 from 1.55 T 0.55 L to 2.61 T 0.56 L (p = 0.001). Mean internal diameter on HRCT during exacerbation was 3.38 T 0.81 mm and after treatment 3.41 T 0.80 mm (p = 0.80). There was one patient with significant increase of internal diameter and it decreased in 2 patients. Improvement of FEV1 was not associated with changes of internal diameter on HRCT (r = 0.39, p = 0.26). Conclusion: Before and after treatment of asthma exacerbation, there was marked improvement of pulmonary function but changes of internal diameter measured by HRCT were not consistent. TNF-\" is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that is also a well known inducer of the inflammatory response and a regulator of immunity. A strong argument exists for TNF-\" being a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disorders of the airways. Once released in the airways, TNF-\" acts by inducing a general inflammatory response mainly through enhanced release of pro-inflammatory/chemotactic mediators and upregulation of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1, thus facilitating the migration of neutrophils and eosinophils. To date there is very limited information on the use of TNF-\" blocking agents in asthma. The present study investigated the effect of soluble TNF-\" receptor on the airway inflammation in mice model of bronchial asthma. Mice were treated with intraperitoneal soluble TNF-\" receptor during the OVA challenge. Mice exposed to OVA developed sustained eosinophilic airway inflammation and sustained AHR to methacholine compared with control mice. Intraperitoneal administration of soluble TNF-\" receptor inhibited the development of AHR and eosinophilic inflammation. Moreover, soluble TNF-\" receptor treatment reduced IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These results suggest that soluble TNF-\" receptor can modulate the airway inflammation and AHR via inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production.",

Recently, the single gene polymorphism associated with the AIA susceptibility has been investigated, but identification of multi-locus single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set in association with the susceptibility has not been investigated. Subjects and Methods: In this study, we selected 23 SNPs in 13 candidate genes for 94 asthmatics with aspirin hypersensitivity (AIA) and 152 asthmatics without aspirin hypersensitivity (aspirin-tolerant asthma, ATA) and genotyped each SNP by a primer extension method. Multi-locus genetic interactions were examined with multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) to test all multi-locus SNP combinations for the efficient prediction of AIA. Results: Through a MDR analysis, we identified four-locus gene-gene interaction models that predict AIA disease risk among asthmatic patients with 64.2 % balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These results suggest that significant epistatic effect of fourlocus genetic interaction may exist in the susceptibility for AIA in asthmatic patients which may be a useful in vitro method to diagnose the AIA with acceptable sensitivity.",

Oral intake and intranasal administration of chitin attenuated allergen-induced airway inflammation in sensitized mice, which may be due to its Th1 adjuvant properties. However, the detailed mechanism of action is not clear. In this report, we demonstrated that water soluble chitosan had specific immunomodulatory effects on dust mite allergen Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f)-stimulated, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in the shifting of Th2 cytokine polarization, decreasing inflammatory cytokine production of IL-6 and TNF-\", down-regulation of CD44, CD14, TLR14, and PAR2 receptor expressions, and inhibiting T-cell proliferation in the presence of allergen-stimulated MDM. Under scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination, chitosan reduced cellular change of pseudopodia formation in Der f-stimulated MDM from allergic asthma patients. The effect of chitosan on allergen-stimulated MDM may occur through inhibited PKCUa phosphorylation and NF-kB pathway activation. In a murine model of asthma, we found that intranasal application of chitosan attenuates Der f-induced lung inflammation by reducing infiltration of inflammatory cells, epithlieal damage, and goblet cell hyperplasia. The production of Arg1, iNOs and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in the bronchial epithelium of allergen-challenged sensitized mice was markedly decreased in chitosan-treated mice. Therefore, we believe that these results of examination of the anti-allergic effect of chitosan may provide a new therapeutic modality for allergic asthma.",

Basic FGF (FGF2) is a member of the large FGF family and plays roles in the proliferation of fibroblast, and the migration and proliferation of airway epithelial cells during wound healing. However, the role of FGF2 in the allergic sensitization is totally unknown, although FGF2 levels are thought to be elevated in patients with asthma. Objective: To evaluate the immunological roles of FGF2 on airway allergen sensitization, and pathogenesis of asthma. Methods: 6-week-old female BALB/C mice were sensitized intranasally with LPS-depleted ovalbumin (OVA) in the presence or absence of 106g of rFGF2 at days 0, 1, 2, 7, and then challenged intranasally with OVA at days 14, 15, 21 and 22. AHR was measured by whole both plethysmography after 24 hours from last challenge. Mice were sacrificed at day 24, and then BAL cellularity, lung histology, and several immunologic parameters were assessed to evaluate the effects of rFGF2 co-treatment. Results: AHR against methacholine challenge was significantly increased in mice sensitized with OVA plus rFGF2 compared with other groups. And number of total cell, macrophage, eosinophils, and lymphocytes in BAL fluids were also makedly increased in rFGF treated mice, accompanied by severe peribronchial and perivascular eosinophilic inflammations from histologic findings. Mucus secretion and subepithelial fibrosis were also increased in these mice, respectively. IL-4, IL-13, and TGF-$1 levels in BAL fluids were markedly enhanced in mice sensitized with OVA plus rFGF2. Conclusion: These finding suggested that FGF2 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, especially promoting allergic sensitization via production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-13, and TGF-$1.",

The recent study using lung specific VEGF over-expressing transgenic mice showed that VEGF induced TH2 lung inflammation. However, it still remains whether the VEGF affects during allergen sensitization or adaptive immune responses by allergen specific T cells. Objective: To assess the roles of VEGF and its receptor (Flt-1/KDR) in allergic sensitization of airways. Methods: C57BL/6 wild type mice were sensitized intranasally with LPS depleted with ovalbumin (OVA) in the presence of 10 l\u0161g of LPS on days 0, 1, 2 and 7 and then challenged intranasally with OVA on days 14, 15, 21 and 22.

Results: On day 4, the number of total cells, macrophage, lymphocytes and neutrophils increased in BAL fluid from the mice sensitized with OVA in the presence of LPS compared to only OVA treated mice. Interestingly, SU5416 blocked the recruitment of inflammatory cells in sensitization period. At this time, the production of TNF-\" and IL-12 also decreased in BAL fluid from SU5416 treated mice. After OVA challenge (day 23) the number of total cells was decreased in BAL from mice treated SU5416 at sensitized period.

Methods: Fourteen asthmatic children were included in this study. Fresh whole blood obtained from patients at two phases: exacerbation and stable phase, were separated to peripheral blood mononuclear cells and were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and mite allergen (Der p1) for 72 hours.

There were no correlations between severity of exacerbation, asthma score, size of skin prick test and cytokine levels. Conclusion: The decrease of IL-10 production in asthmatic children during acute exacerbation may have a role in asthma exacerbation. The decrease of IL-10 production in more severe asthma (moderate persistent) supports the idea of defective immune regulation of IL-10. Further studies in IL-10 producing cells and treatment to enhance IL-10 responses might be useful in prevention and treatment of asthma.",

They cause bronchoconstriction, mucous hypersecretion, increased microvascular permability, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophil infiltration. The biological action of cysLTs is mediated via CysLT 1 and CysLT 2 receptors. Human CysLTR 1 gene consists of five exons variably spliced. Transcript I, composed of 1, 4 and 5 exons is a major transcript present in human leukocytes, smooth muscles. Transcript II, composed of 1 and 5 exons is less abundant but find in blood leukocytes, smooth muscles, hart, brain. The role of alternative transcripts in asthma pathogenesis is still not known. Aim: The goal of our study was to investigate differences in expression of CysLTR 1 alternative transcripts I and II in patient with bronchial asthma and healthy control group. Methods: PBMCs were obtained from peripheral blood of 20 patients with severe and non-severe asthma and 15 healthy volunteers. Total RNA was obtained from mononuclear cell using TotalRNA and cDNA was synthesized using Reverse Transcriptase. We designed specific primers spanning exonexon junction in the transcript I (exons 1Y5) and transcript II (exon 1Y4) and common primer in the CysLTR 1 coding region according to published CysLTR 1 transcripts sequences. Real-time PCR reactions were performed on RotorGene using Evagreen dye. Results: We found that CysLTR 1 transcripts I and II are present in patients with asthma and in control group. The CysLTR 1 transcripts II/I ratio was 26,02 % in patient with severe asthma, 25,99 % with moderate asthma, 56,44 % with mild asthma and 44,20 % in control group. In addition, we found significant difference in CysLTR 1 transcripts II/I ratio in severe asthmatic subgroup in comparison to controls [p = 0,004], severe asthmatic in comparison to mild [p = 0,018] and in CysLTR 1 transcripts II/I ratio in moderate asthmatic in comparison to control group [p = 0,0004] and in mild asthmatic in comparison to control group [p = 0,007]. Conclusion: Differences in CysLTR 1 alternative transcripts expression might possibly contribute to airway inflammation in patient with bronchial asthma.

Background: Special regulatory role of prostaglandin E2 has been postulated in aspirin-induced asthma. The aim if this study was to investigate the effects of aspirin on systemic production of prostaglandin E2 and cysteinyl leukotrienes in patients with asthma. Methods: We determined urinary concentrations of two main prostaglandin E2 metabolites: 13,14-dihydro-15keto-PGE2 using commercial enzyme immunoassay and 9,15-dioxo-11alpha-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetranor-prostane-1,20-dioic acid using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; and leukotriene E4 using immunoassay. Determinations were performed at baseline and following oral aspirin and celecoxib challenges, in two well-defined asthma phenotypes: aspirin-sensitive and aspirin-tolerant patients. Results: Aspirin precipitated bronchial reactions in all aspirin-sensitive, but in none of the aspirin-tolerant patients. Celecoxib 400 mg was well tolerated by all patients except for one with aspirin-induced asthma. At baseline mean prostaglandin E2 metabolites values did not differ between the groups. Following different aspirin provocation doses, the two main prostaglandin E2 metabolites were decreased in the aspirin-tolerant group, but their mean level remained unchanged in the aspirin-sensitive group. The dose of aspirin had no effect on the magnitude of the response on the prostaglandin E2 metabolites and its duration. In both groups urinary prostaglandin E2 metabolites decreased following celecoxib challenge. No correlation was found between prostaglandin E2 metabolites and leukotriene E4. Conclusion: Aspirin-precipitated asthmatic attacks are not associated with changes in the systemic prostaglandin E2 production. In contrast, prostaglandin E2 systemic production becomes depressed by aspirin in nonsensitive patients. This different response might indicate COX-1 dependent prostaglandin E2 control of inflammatory cells in AIA. Thus, PGE2 is released during the clinical reactions to aspirin through an alternate COX-2 pathway. Clinical implications of this finding are in line with current observations of good tolerance of the selective COX-2 inhibitors in sensitive patients.",

Background: There is increasing evidence of the importance of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LT) as mediators of aspirin-induced bronchoconstriction in aspirin-sensitive asthma but the cellular origin of the LT is not yet clear. Methods: Urinary concentrations of leukotriene E4 (LTE4), 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, 9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin F2, and Ntau-methylhistamine were measured during the 24 h following cumulative intravenous administration of increasing doses of lysine aspirin to asthmatic patients. In addition, the urinary concentrations of these metabolites were measured on 10 consecutive days in a patient who suffered an asthma attack after percutaneous administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Results: In aspirin-induced asthma patients (AIA, n = 18), the basal concentration of urinary LTE4, but not the other metabolites, was significantly higher than that in aspirin-tolerant asthma patients (ATA, n = 16). After intravenous aspirin provocation, the AIA group showed a 12.6-fold (geometric mean) increase in excretion of LTE4 during the first 6 h, and 9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin F2 also increased in the AIA group during the first 0Y6 h and the 6Y9 h collection period. Ntau-methylhistamine excretion was also increased, but to a lesser degree. Administration of aspirin caused significant suppression of 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 excretion in both the AIA and ATA groups. When the percentage of maximum increase of each metabolite from the baseline concentrations was compared between the AIA group and the ATA group, a significantly higher increase in excretion of LTE4, 9alpha,11beta-prostaglandin F2, and Ntau-methylhistamine was observed in the AIA group than the ATA group. An increased excretion of LTE4 and 9alpha, 11beta-prostaglandin F2 has been detected in a patient who suffered an asthma attack after percutaneous administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Conclusion: Considering that human lung mast cells are capable of producing LTC4, prostaglandin D2, and histamine, the results of our study support the concept that mast cells, at least, may participate in the development of aspirininduced asthma.",

Background: Bronchial asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, hiperresponsiveness to variety of stimuli and airway obstruction, which can be reversible. Different cells are involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, like: T-lymphocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages etc. A number of different inflammatory cells infiltrate the airways. The trigger can cause the release of inflammatory mediators from the cells, which could be the markers of inflammation. Methods: We have investigated the role and the importance of inflammatory cells and mediators like eosinophils, ECP, IL-4 and IL-5. We studied 77 subjects divided in three groups as follows: 1. asthma patients; 2. patients with obstructive bronchitis and 3. control group. Results: The number of eosinophils was significantly increased in the group of asthma patients versus second and third group. The eosinophils have their very important role in allergic inflammation. We found that the presence of ECP demonstrate an ongoing inflammation, with or without clinical symptoms in asthma patients. There was significant difference between the values of ECP of asthma patients versus second group with bronchitis and healthy controls. The values of IL-4 were not significantly increased between the groups. We found the explanation in the fact that IL-4 is a marker for early allergic inflammation. Our results have shown that IL-5 is involved in the pathophysiology of asthma. The values of IL-5 were significantly increased versus second group and controls. We also found the decrease of the values of inflammatory markers after the treatment with corticosteroids. Conclusion: We concluded that eosinophils, ECP and IL-5 could be useful markers for selecting allergic patients and they could be used together with other examinations. The markers of inflammation could have their important role in the measurement of the allergic inflammation and they could be the monitors of treatment effects.",

CpG-based immunotherapy significantly reversed both acute and chronic markers of inflammation compared with specific Ag immunotherapy. IL-10 levels were also measured both in splenocyte and lung culture supernatants. The results showed that antigen recall responses of lung culture from mucosal treated mice demonstrated an antigen-specific enhanced release of IL-10, but the concentration of this regulatory cytokine had no significant changes in splenocyte culture medium. These results suggest that mucosal immunotherapy with CpG DNA may induce local production of cytokines without systemic effects on Th responses.

Background: To date, airway remodeling is usually assessed using histological examination of airways. However, now it is possible to assess and quantify the extent of airway remodeling in vivo using high-resolution CT (HRCT). The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate airway wall thickness as indicator of remodeling by using thin section HRCT in asthmatics, and to correlate these findings with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) results and other clinical indices in asthmatics. Methods: 41 patients with asthma and 20 healthy controls participated in the study. Remodeling as measured by whole airway wall thickness was assessed with HRCT. Thickness-to diameter ratio (TDR) and the percentage wall area (PWA) were determined. Spirometric tests were also performed. Results: TDR and PWA were significantly higher in asthmatics than in controls. Both TDR and PWA were strongly correlated with disease severity and duration. Also, TDR and PWA were inversely correlated with the percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC %), forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1%) and FEV1/FVC and post-bronchodilator reversibility in asthmatics. Conclusion: These findings indicate that HRCT is useful non-invasive method for assessment of airway wall thickness. Airway wall thickening occurs more in patients with moderate and severe asthma and its degree is related to the duration and severity of asthma and degree of airflow obstruction.",

Conclusion: MDI may be a causative agent of occupational asthma among MDI-exposed workers. The prevalence of MDI-occupational asthma was 8.6%, and MDI-eosinophilic bronchitis was confirmed in 2 workers. The presence of work-related lower respiratory symptoms and serum specific IgG to MDI-human serum albumin conjugate may be useful to predict MDIoccupational asthma/eosinophilic bronchitis in MDI exposed workers. Results: The average duration of employment of workers was 10 years and 12% were pesticide crop sprayers. Work-related wheeze (26%), ocular-nasal (24%), urticaria/skin symptoms (14%) were more prevalent in the orchards. The prevalence of sensitization (SPT) was the highest to TU (22%) followed by house dust mite (16%), with 25% being atopic. The prevalence of allergy to TU (skin reactivity and work-related symptoms) was 9.5%, with respiratory (6%) more common than skin allergy (3%). Work-related ocular-nasal (OR = 4.9) and skin (OR = 3.7) symptoms were more commonly reported by pesticide crop sprayers. Workers with TU-allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and probable asthma were more likely to be atopic, spray pesticides and have low (G30 U/g Hgb) AChE levels. Background: Toluene diisocyanate (TDI), a highly reactive industrial chemical, is one of the leading causes of occupation-related asthma in industrialized countries. The pathogenesis of TDI-induced asthma remains not fully understood, in part due to lack of appropriate animal models. In our study, we established a novel TDI asthma mouse model by epicutaneous sensitization and intranasal challenge. Methods: Thirty two 6Y8 week BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8): TDI, acetone olive oil (AOO), ovalbumin (OVA) and saline (sal). On days 0, 7 and 14, the mice were epicutaneously sensitized with 1% TDI in 100 2l acetone: olive oil (3:2, AOO), 100 2l AOO, 100 2l 0.1% OVA in sal and 100 2l sal respectively, every allergen or solvent was placed on a patch of sterile gauze (1\u00c21 cm) which was taped to the skin of shaved mouse back and kept for 3 days per sensitization. On days 21, 23 and 25, mice were challenged intranasally with 25 2l identical allergen or solvent respectively once a day. All mice were sacrificed on day 27. 24 hours before first intranasal challenge and after last intranasal challenge, airway responsiveness to methacholine (Mch) was measured in an unrestrained whole body plethysmogragh and was expressed as enhanced pause (Penh). Mice were exposed to nebulized phosphate-buffered saline as the baseline and then increasing dose of Mch, namely 5%, 10%, 20% and 40% followed by measurement of Penh values for 5 minutes. TDI-and OVA-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgE in sera were measured by ELISA and expressed as optical density (OD) mean value's. Results: 1. Histology: TDI-exposed mice exhibited neutrophil-dominant pulmonary inflammation in the peri-bronchial and peri-vascular regions by lung tissue haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, and increased mucus secretion by PAS staining, while OVA-treated mice exhibited an eosinophildominant inflammation and mucus production. 2. After challenge in TDItreated mice airway responsiveness was significantly augmented, but not in OVA-and solvent-treated mice. 3. Significant increased production of sera TDI-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgE in TDI-treated mice was observed as well as the increased OVA-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgE in OVA mice. Conclusion: Our study showed that allergic asthmatic responses to a chemical sensitizer such as TDI may occur after dermal sensitization and airway challenge via IgE-mediated mechanism.",

This study aimed to determine the predictors for work-related symptoms, allergic sensitisation, non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness (NSBH) and baker's asthma in small bakeries of a supermarket chain store in South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 517 (current and previously employed) bakers was conducted in 31 Cape Town bakeries using a modified European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) questionnaire, skin prick tests to common aeroallergens and cereal flours, as well as serum specific IgE to wheat flour, rye flour and fungal alpha amylase by ImmunoCAP-system (Phadia, Sweden). NSBH was assessed using the Medic Aid Pro Nebulizer Dosimeter method. Exposure-response modeling was conducted to identify significant determinants. Results: The mean age of bakers was 32 years and 47% were current smokers. The prevalence of atopy (positive SPT to Q1 common aeroallergen) was 42%. Common work-related symptoms were ocular-nasal (31%) and chest tightness/ wheezing (17%). One third of bakers were sensitised to bakery allergens with 25% sensitised to cereal flours such as wheat and rye. There were 22% of the workers who demonstrated evidence of bronchial responsiveness with 2/3 of these having airway obstruction. Doubling the employment duration was associated with an increased odds for specific IgE reactivity to wheat (OR: Background: Occupational allergy in cutlers is a very strange phenomena even though they handle a lot of potencially allergenic substances. Case Report: A 40-year-old man, cutler since he was 14, active smoker of 20 cigarettes/day. He was referred to our deparment because he presented during the last 4 months daily dysnea, wheeze, cough and thoracic oppression accompanied by rhinitis and conjunctivitis of diurnal predominance and clearly related to his work place. He had been treated with formoterol 9 mcg/ budesonida 320 mcg every 12 hours since 45 days before his visit. He got worse throughout the week and specially on Fridays, when he swept the floor of the factory, forcing him this fact to go to the emergency deparment in 3 occasions. He improved during the weekend and referred to work with metals, wood of olive tree, oak (Bwith resin[) and an artificial wood, although other workers next to him handled deer antler (since 4 years before) and bull horn. In his previous work in a cutlery (16 years before), he used to work with deer antler and wood; during the last three months of working there he presented daily cough, dysnea and wheeze which were related to wood dust. Once he changed the company to the present one, he remained asymptomatic during 15 years until now.",

Methods: Ninety-seven talc workers and 110 unexposed employees as the reference group were randomly selected from a local rubber industry. Standardized respiratory questionnaires were administered to the subjects, they underwent chest X-ray and were examined by a specialist for any possible respiratory abnormality to be diagnosed. Furthermore, Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) were measured just before and after the work shift. Moreover, to assess the extent to which workers had been exposed to talc dust, using standard methods, inhalable and respirable dust concentrations were measured in different dusty worksites. Results: The average (mean T SD) age (years), weight (kg), height (cm) and duration of exposure to talc dust (years) for the exposed group were 35.8 T 6.75, 73.1 T 9.2, 172.3 T 5.9 and 11.79 T 5.3, respectively. The corresponding values for the non-exposed group were 36. 1 T 6.87, 73.36 T 8.1, 173.2 T 5.7 and 0 T 0, respectively. Atmospheric concentrations of inhalable and respirable talc dust were estimated to be 41.8 T 23.52 and 19.8 T 8.04 mg/m3, (mean T SD), respectively. Talc exposed subjects had a significantly higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms. Similarly, PFTs revealed that exposure to this lubricating agent was associated with significant decreases in the mean percentage predicted of vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). Likewise, there was a general tendency for VC, FVC and FEV1 to decrease as estimated cumulative exposure (years worked) increased. Moreover, there was an acute reduction in some parameters of pulmonary function such as VC, FVC and FEV1, over the work shift. Chest radiographs of exposed workers showed that pneumoconiosis profusions were between p 0/0 and p 2/1 according to the ILO 1980 chest X-ray classification. Conclusion: These results support the notion that occupational inhalation exposure to talc is associated with chronic respiratory disorders and induces bronchitis and interstitial lung disease. Additionally, they support the hypothesis that inhalation exposure to talc dust induces acute aalergic reversible adverse effect on PFTs.",

Significant improvement or disappearance of symptoms or AHR at follow up period is frequently used for the parameter of OA outcome measurement. However, few studies have longitudinally evaluated the change of lung function and AHR by serial measurement. To evaluate the significance of the lung function or AHR as outcome parameter, we serially measured it and compared its change with the clinical condition of OA. Methods: Pulmonary function test, methacholine bronchial provocation testing, asthma symptom and medication scores were evaluated at regular interval in 35 patients with OA confirmed by specific challenge tests. Results: AHR continuously resolved during the follow-up period (mean: 7.5 years, range: 1Y16 years) in 5 (14.3%) of 35 patients. AHR transiently disappeared, however, subsequently re-developed in an additional 5 patients. The level of AHR improved (increase in methacholine PC20 by 3.2-fold or more) in 9 (25.7%) patients, but fluctuated in remaining 16 (45.7%) patients. The level of FEV1 was fluctuated along with the severity of asthma symptom, but not in proportion to the level of AHR. In 20 of 24 patients with reduced lung function at initial examination, lung function did not recover during the follow up period. Significant improvement of symptoms and maintenance of nearly asymptomatic state were achieved in 5 patients. Three of them had disappearance of AHR, but 2 patients showed fluctuated levels of AHR. Lung function and severity of asthma at diagnosis, and the interval between the development of OA symptoms and avoidance was associated with functional impairment. Conclusion: In spite of medical treatment and avoidance, many patients with OA had persistent and fluctuated AHR and lung function impairment even in the absence of respiratory symptom. Intermittent or single assessment of lung function or AHR as outcome measure might lead to incorrect clinical evaluation, and more comprehensive approach will be required. Background: Allergic diseases constitute a global health problem, as they have an increasing economic and social impact and, especially, they can deeply interfere with patients_ daily life, being a cause of physical and emotional discomfort. This is why health related quality of life (HRQoL) has become increasingly important in healthcare research. Aim: To examine the scientific literature of the last three years dealing with the impact of allergic rhinitis (AR) treatments suggested by ARIA guidelines on patients_ HRQoL, and to identify the unexplored or not fully investigated areas concerning this issue. Methods: Studies were sought from MEDLINE (1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006 using as key words the ARIA suggested drugs [AND] allergic rhinitis [AND] and quality of life. Only randomized, DBC trials published in peerreviewed journals, using validated questionnaires were selected. Results: Our research has lead to a selection of 34 DBPC trials, 4 in paediatric and 30 in adult population. HRQoL has been assessed in a total of 10957 patients. The RQLQ questionnaire was used in 27 studies. The Rhinasthma was applied in one study involving patients with both rhinitis and asthma. SF-36 was used together with the specific questionnaire in 3 trials. Only a paper on sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) evaluated health status by means of SF-36 and subjective satisfaction by means of Satisfaction Profile (SAT-P).",

Background: Nocturnal sleep disturbances, excessive daytime sleepiness and impairment in quality of life (QOL) in allergic rhinitis are often overlooked both by patients and physicians alike. Methods: Consecutive skin allergy test positive patients with allergic rhinitis and matched controls were subjected to computed tomography of paranasal sinuses (CT-PNS) Patients were categorized as allergic rhinitis (group 1), allergic rhinitis with sinusitis (group 2) and controls (group 3). They were evaluated for nocturnal sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep specific QOL disturbances using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epsworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaires (NRQLQ) respectively. They were also categorized as Bsneezer-runners[ or Bblockers[. Results: Of the 207 patients (141 males, 66 females), 75(36%) were in group 1, while 132(64%), in group 2 and 23 in group 3. Patients in group 2 had significantly higher mean scores for PSQI, ESS and NRQLQ questionnaires as compared to group 1. Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is a hypersensitive immune response to allergens that causes nasal and ocular symptoms and leads to significant decline in the sufferers' Quality Of Life (QOL). In the Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) model of allergen exposure, the relationship between SAR scores and their QOL has not been investigated. To this end, a specialized Rhinoconjunctivitis QOL (EEC-RQOL) Questionnaire has been developed to evaluate the QOL problems experienced by patients while they are in the chamber. The questionnaire contains 16 questions in 4 domains: Non-nose/Eye symptoms (NNE), practical problems (PP), emotional problems (EP), and global assessment (GA).",

Secondly, to determine the effect of sequential EEC visits on QOL. Methods: A group of 208 Ragweed-sensitive study subjects were exposed to Ragweed pollen (3500 T grains/m3) in the EEC for 3h in which they recorded instantaneous TSS every half-hour on 4 consecutive days. The relationship between EEC-RQOL scores and TSS over the 4 visits was examined using Pearson's correlation and linear regression. Results: During each of the four visits, all individual domains as well as the total EEC-RQOL scores significantly correlated with the symptom scores (see Table 1 ). As subjects participated in subsequent EEC visits, the line of linear regression from 1st to 4th visit shows a clear rightward shift and a gradual increase in slope. Conclusion: The QOL measured in the EEC using EEC-RQOL Questionnaire significantly correlated with the SAR symptoms of subjects on all visit days. The change in linear regression over the four visits indicates an increasing SAR severity, and that is accompanied by a subsequent decline in QOL. Moreover, subjects appear to experience a greater deterioration in QOL over visits as its rate of decline is faster than the worsening of SAR symptoms. Our findings suggest the negative effect on QOL associated with EEC confinement and thus confirm the importance of developing an EEC-specific RQOL questionnaire. Furthermore, we have demonstrated its cross-sectional construct validity. ",

Background: In recent years multiple HRQL questionnaires have been developed specifically for rhinitis and rhinosinusitis. Several reviews described HRQL questionnaires concerning rhinitis and/or (rhino) sinusitis. However, little attention has been paid to the quality of the psychometric properties of these questionnaires. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to give a quality-assessed review of the existing disease-specific health related quality of life questionnaires concerning rhinitis and rhinosinusitis for adults. Methods: We reviewed the literature up to May 2007 in Pubmed, EMBASE and Medline, to identify studies of interest. Additionally the database of the AAAAI Quality of Life Resources and the Patient-reported Outcome and QOL Instruments Database were searched. The quality is assessed by defining the characteristics of a quality of life questionnaire with assessment criteria. Results: The results of the construction, description, feasibility, and the psychometric performance of the instruments are provided. We finally provide a clinician_s guide to choose a questionnaire based on the measurement goals, the discriminant validity, responsiveness and the points obtained in the quality assessment.

University of Genoa, Allergy and Respiratory Diseases, Genova, Italy. Background: The existence of a close link between asthma and rhinitis, which brings consequences both in therapy and disease management, has been demonstrated by many studies. Objectives: The trial we performed had the following aims: to assess physicians_ knowledge on rhinitis/asthma comorbidity, to evaluate patients_ management behaviour and their experience about symptoms and expectations, to investigate the clinical and psychological meaning of GPs_ and patients_ knowledge. Methods: 101 general practitioners and 504 asthmatic patients were involved in the study. They were asked to fill in two different multiple-choice questionnaires about the association between asthma and rhinitis and its impact. Results: 34.7% of general practitioners are aware of the asthma-rhinitis link, and 43.6% of them assume the comorbidity on the basis of their clinical experience. 21.8% of physicians make the diagnosis autonomously. 27.8% of asthmatic patients experience three or less rhinitic symptoms, 41% from 4 to 6 symptoms, and 31.2 more than 6 symptoms. The symptoms have a deep impact on daily life, as they are cause of sleep problems (87.3%), lack of concentration (78.9%), difficulties in spare time (71.8%) and sport (71.7%). Rhinitis symptoms are responsible for the worsening of asthma, with an increase of dyspnoea (86.3%), cough (73.9%) wheezing (59%). 93% of patients state they are interested in a combination therapy approach.

Background: Leukotrienes and histamine are thought to be quantitatively the most prominent mediators in the final pathways of allergic rhinitis (AR). Intranasal corticosteroids and oral antihistamines are the cornerstones of therapy. Antileukotriene therapy combined with antihistamine showed a synergistic effect in treating AR, however, there is little data on objective parameters and quality of life measures. Methods: This multi-centered, prospective, randomized and plabebo controlled study randomized 275 patients with mild or moderate intermitant AR into three groups as: fexofenadine (120 mg/day), fexofenadine plus montelukast (10 mg/day) or fexofenadine plus placebo. The nasal endoscopic examinations, objective upper airway measurements (anterior rhinomanometry), were evaluated before and at end of 21 days treatment period. Daily symptom scored by a standard visual analoge scale (VAS) and by a daily diary of quality of life measures. Results: Nasal endoscopic examination showed an additional effect on turbinate congestion with combination therapy. Objective nasal airway assessment revealed that total nasal resistance decreased from 0,42 Pa/cm3/s to 0,32 Pa/cm3/s with monotherapy, and from 0,43 Pa/cm3/s to 0,27 Pa/cm3/s with combination therapy (p G 0,05) in average. Mean symtom scores of nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing pointed out a significant decline in the first three days, however nasal congestion scores were better with the antileukotriene add-on therapy. The positive effect on quality of life measures mainly in sleep, daily life activities and performance were increased, but combination therapy revealed significantly better results at the end of 21 days. It is significantly more effective than placebo. No side effects were encountered. Conclusion: These data provide a basis for optimism in the control of AR with antileukotriene-antihistamine combination therapy. The control on nasal congestion was more pronounced subjectively and objectively comparing to antihistamine alone. The effect might be due to the additional antiinflammatory activity as provided by reduction of inflammatory infiltrate and cytokine levels. More long-term studies are needed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of antileukotrienes, especially as add-on therapy. Available data suggest it is reasonable and safe to add these agents to standard therapy if nasal symptomatology remains unresolved.",

            "text": "The role of montelukast on perennial allergic rhinitis and associated sleep disturbance and daytime somnolence Background: One of the main manifestations of perennial allergic rhinitis is congestion. Nasal congestion can predispose to sleep apnea and microarousals. This sleep disturbance can result in daytime somnolence and fatigue. The use of montelukast may be effective at reducing congestion, but objective and subjective studies are lacking that demonstrate if the reduction of congestion will result in improved sleep and reduced somnolence. It was the purpose of this research to determine if montelukast is effective at improving sleep and daytime somnolence in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Methods: The study was a crossover, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study using montelukast 10 mg tablet or matched placebo and was approved by the IRB. Active phase of the study included a 2-week run-in followed by a treatment period of 2 weeks. After a wash out of 2 weeks, subjects were crossed over to the alternate arm of the study for 2 weeks. Subjective instruments to assess sleep and daytime somnolence were utilized. SAS was used for statistical assessment. Results: Montelukast 10 mg as compared to placebo statistically improved daytime sleepiness (p = 0.0089) and daytime fatigue (0.0087). With our small cohort we were unable to significantly demonstrate decreased congestion; however; congestion was reduced by 0.52 on a scale of 0Y3, while placebo reduced congestion by 0.16. Conclusion: Montelukast can reduce daytime somnolence and fatigue and may be a suitable alternative to topical nasal corticosteroids in those unwilling to use or are intolerant to nasal steroids and have daytime impairment from perennial allergic rhinitis.",

Thirty-one patients were randomly assigned to receive either intranasal irradiation (low doses of UV-B, UV-A and visible light, referred to as mUV/VIS) 3 times a week for 2 weeks (n = 18), or 180 mg fexofenadine HCl per day for 2 weeks (n = 13). Each patient kept a diary of symptoms for nasal obstruction, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, sneezing and palate itching during the treatment. Total nasal score (TNS), a sum of scores for nasal symptoms was also calculated. In the mUV/ VIS group the individual scores significantly decreased compared with baseline for all of the parameters, sneezing (p = 0.0001), rhinorrhea (p = 0.0004), nasal itching (p = 0.0005), nasal obstruction (p = 0.009) and palate itching (p = 0.0001). In the fexofenadine HCl group none of the scores improved significantly at the end of the treatment except sneezing (p = 0.03). TNS was significantly decreased in the mUV/VIS group (p = 0.00003), but no significant change was observed in the fexofenadine HCl group. In conclusion, we found that intranasal phototherapy is a more efficient therapeutic tool than fexofenadine HCl in reducing clinical symptoms for allergic rhinitis.",

Methods: A cross-sectional, random-digit-dialing telephone survey of 30,987 Canadian households was conducted in July 2006 to identify adult AR patients. After screening 3671 adults, structured interviews were done with 1001 respondents (patients diagnosed by a physician as having AR or taking medication for AR). Results: About 45% of Canadian adults report suffering from nasal symptoms due to allergies unrelated to colds. Less than half (45%) have been diagnosed by a physician. Half only have seasonal symptoms, with spring and summer being the worst seasons. Of those with AR, 27% had asthma, 17% chronic or recurrent sinusitis and 5% nasal polyps. More than onequarter cannot tolerate their symptoms without treatment. Most (83%) have sought medical attention for their symptoms at one time and one-quarter have done so in the past year. The most bothersome symptoms include stuffy nose, runny nose, repeated sneezing and watering eyes. In their worst month, two-thirds of patients reported having a stuffed nose either daily or several days per week. Almost one-quarter reported headaches and sleep loss. One-fifth describe symptoms as poorly controlled or not controlled during the worst month of the year. One-half use only OTC products, 12% use only prescriptions while one-quarter use both. Conclusion: Despite treatment, many Canadians experience allergic rhinitis symptoms that could be better evaluated and controlled.

Celal Bayar University, Otorhinolaryngology and Head-Neck Surgery, Manisa, Turkey. Background: In patients who suffer from persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR), a severe drug-resistant hypertrophy and increase in glandular structures of the inferior turbinates may develop, which leads to constant nasal obstruction and rhinorea. Radiofrequency tissue ablation of the turbinates can reduce nasal obstruction and secretions. Methods: This prospective, single-sited study randomized 50 patients with mild or moderate PAR who had substantial bilateral hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates to mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray (MFMNS), (2 sprays per nostril [total dose 200 2g] once daily), or radiofrequency inferior turbinate ablation (RIFA), (2 or 3 punctures on each site, total dose of 1510 T 110 joule, plateau temperature of 75-C, energy of 10 watt) treatment groups. Both objective outcomes evaluated by total nasal resistance at anterior rhinomanometry and subjective outcomes assessed with the Quality of Life Questionnaire were analyzed before and at least 12 months after treatment. Results: The median total nasal resistance in patients treated with MFMNS decreased from 0,49 T 0,17 Pa/cm 3 /s to 0,39 Pa/cm 3 /s (p = 0,42), and 0,51 T 0,18 Pa/cm 3 /s to 0,29 Pa/cm 3 /s in patients with RIFA (p = 0,003) 1 year postoperatively. Compared with preoperative scores, the postoperative scores of these patients significantly improved in both 7 separate domain scores and overall Quality of Life Questionnaire scores (p = 0,004). Nasal symptomatology was markedly reduced 1 month after radiofrequency application. No adverse reactions including bleeding, infection, adhesions or worsening of allergic symptoms were encountered. The patients experienced a lasting benefit from this procedure. Conclusion: These results suggest that topical mometasone reduces the volume of inferior turbinate at some point while improving the quality of life in patients with PAR. Radiofrequency inferior turbinoplasty is also improving quality of life and is more effective for decreasing nasal resistance in patients with PAR who have substantial nasal congestion. This effect might be due to the switch between the inflammatory cells and the fibrotic tissue. Histopathologic and longer term studies are required to enlighten the potential of RIFA in the management of allergic rhinitis.",

Objective: To investigate the histopathologic characteristic of a marked chronic inflammatory reaction and remodeling, and that the role of reactivation of epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit in this marked structure change of the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis. Methods: Our study will be divided into two parts. The first part is to investigate whether remodeling of the airway mucosa are present in nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis. The second part is to investigate the possible role of epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit in the pathogenesis of inflammation and remodeling in allergic rhinitis. The tissue blocks were embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), alcian blue periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS), Masson's Trichrome(MT), and immunohistochemical staining. The infiltrating eosinophils in nasal mucosa were examined, AB-PAS-positive cells in the surface epithelium in nasal mucosa were counted. The percentage area of MT stained extracellular matrix in mucosa and conchae and damage of epithelium were determined by an image analyzer. immunohistochemical staining revealed EGF, EGFR, TGF-\", and !-SMA immunoreactivity in nasal mucosa. Results: Epithelial damage (shedding), basement membrane thickening, submucosa fibrosis, mucosal goblet cell hyperplasia, submucous gland hyperplasia, and strikingly eosinophil infiltration, lymphocyte infiltration was more prominent in patients with AR compared to the non-AR group (p G0.05). Compared with the control group, immunohistochemical staining revealed EGF, EGFR immunoreactivity in the damaged epithelium were decreased in allergic rhinitis. However, stronger TGF-\" and !-SMA immunoreactivity was observed in allergic rhinitis mucosa as compared with normal nasal mucosa. Conclusion: The histopathologic findings of asthma, epithelial damage, goblet cells hyperplasia and extracellular matrix deposition, namely, inflammation and features of airway remodeling, are also present in allergic rhinitis. It maybe result from activation of the epithelialmesenchymal unit, leading to myofibroblast activation and propagation of remodeling responses into the submucosa. The concept of epithelialmesenchymal unit maybe contribute to the further understanding the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis and may provide potential targets for novel therapy of allergic rhinitis.",

The aim of this study was to show our clinical experiences on grass pollen sensitized allergic patients. Methods: We have treated AR patients (N = 243) with intranasal mUV/VIS between 2003Y2006. 79 patients had moderate/sever intermittant grass pollen induced AR. The pollen counts were over 40/m3 continuously. Rhinophototherapy was performed in monotherapy or combined with oral antihistamines (once a day) or/with nasal steroids (maximum 400 2g/die). Each intranasal cavity was irradiated 2Y3 times a week, for 2 weeks with mUV/VIS. The dose of irradiation was raised step by step from 1.6 to 2.7 J/cm2/nasel cavity. Nasal symptoms of each patient were registered on the treatment days with a scale of 0 to 3 and the total symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS: 0Y10). Results: 3 patients dropped out (3,8%) . Finally 75 patients got full therapy. Monotherapy mUV/VIS: got worse: 6% of the patients, didn't change 19%, improved: 75% by VAS. mUV/VIS+drugs: got worse 5%, didn't change 8%, improved 87%. The nasal symptoms were significantly improved in each group. Rhinophototherapy was tolerated well. Using vitamin A oil 3Y4 times a day the development of painful xeromucosa could be avoided. Only 2 patients (2,53%) needed to have extra (more than one) brake days between two treatment occasions. Conclusion: These results suggest that intranasal phototherapy alone or with drug combined is an effective modality to treat grass pollen induced AR.",

Mechnikov's research institute for vaccines and sera, Allergological department, Moscow, Russian Federation. Background: The adenoid is a part of Waldeyer's ring, the basic function of which is antibody formation, that react later against a great variety of antigens. Pediatric adenoidal obstruction of the nasal airway is associated with significant morbidity and is a frequent indication for surgery, but its relationship to allergy has not been often studied. Methods: To examine the influence of atopy on the adenoid hypertrophy we studied 35 children 1Y11 years old. In the analysed group all children suffered from difficulty in nose breathing, rhinorrhea, recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, hearing disorders, sleep disturbance. For the diagnostic of adenoid hypertrophy we had used the anamnesis, anterior rhinoscopy, endoscopy rhinoscopy. All patients had been consulted by the allergist-immunologist. For the diagnosis of allergic rhintis we had used interview, skin prick-test, presence of sIgE (RAST) in the serum, nasal provocation test with dust and polen allergens. Results: All children had had adenoid hypertrophy 2 or 3Y4 degree, 3 of them had got the relapse of adenoids after the surgery. In the analised group 21 children (60%) had had the positive skin prick-tests and/or positive reactions to specific IgE, mostly to different kinds of pollen or house dust mites; eosiniphils in nasal secrete; positive nasal provocation tests. In this group 9 patients (25%) had had the bronchial asthma, and 6 children (17%) Y atopic dermatitis. All patients with adenoids and allergic rhinitis had got the complex therapy Y topical nasal steroid and antihistaminic in the ages doses. The children with brochial asthma and atopic dermatitis also received a pharmacological treatment. In a during of 3 weeks we observed the most significant decrease of clinical symptoms and endoscopic adenoid size. Conclusion: The study shows that allergy and sensitivity to different kinds of allergens is an important risk factor for a greater degree of adenoid hypertrophy in children. Chronic allergic inflammation of the upper airway is the causes of lymphoid hypertrophy with prominence of adenoidal and tonsillar tissue. So, all patients with the difficulty in nase breathing and reccurent upper respiratory tract infections need in the consultation by allergist-immunologist for exception of allegic diseases.",

Results: Clinical symptom score and use of shortYacting $ 2Yagonists were similar in both groups and there was no difference in FEV1 (63.00 3.75 vs. 65.84 3.58, p 9 0.05). Asthma symptom scores (2.83 0.14) and activity limitation (3.47 0.22) within AQLQ were significantly lower for patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis compared with those asthma patients without allergic rhinitis (4.01 0.21 and 4.23 0.25, p G 0.05). Conclusion: Persistent allergic rhinitis may have a negative effect both on asthma symptoms and on quality of life in patients with atopic asthma. Background: Allergic rhinitis is the most common cause of rhinitis affecting approximately 20% of the population. While allergic rhinitis is not a lifethreatening condition, complications can occur and the condition can significantly impair quality of life, which leads to a number of indirect costs. In susceptible individuals, exposure to certain foreign proteins leads to allergic sensitization, which is characterized by the production of specific IgE directed against these proteins. This specific IgE can be tracked with Standard Skin Prick Test. Methods and Materials: During 6 months of study, 334 cases of allergic disorders referred to our allergy clinic, among them 295 were allergic rhinitis. Standard Skin Prick Test with ALUSTAL prick allergens, aero-allergens and food allergens, were performed for all of them and compared with negative and positive standard control. Wheals of 3-mm and flares of 10-mm larger than negative control regarded as positive test. Results were analyzed with SPSS 11.5 and prevalence of allergens was calculated in different groups of patients in regard to age, sex and type of allergic rhinitis (perennial or seasonal). Results: 150 males with mean age of 25.6 years (SD: 14.31) and 145 females with mean age of 28.32 (SD: 12.93) were studied among them 85 patients (30%) had seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR), 117 patients (41.3%) had Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR), 65 patients (23%) had PAR with seasonal aggravation and 16 patients (5.7%) had only episodic symptoms. 116 patients had less than 5 years, 117 patients had 5Y10 years and 102 patients had more than 10 years history of rhinitis. Aeroallergen sensitization were detected in 256 (86.5%) of patients and botanical allergens`sensitization were shown to be present in 225 (76%) of patients. Chenopodiacea including Chenopodium alba and Rough pigweed, trees especially ash, platanus, willow and birch, 12 grasses including artemisia, rye-grass and timothy were among the most prevalent botanical allergens. Conclusion: Allergic rhinitis is the most prevalent allergies which cause signs and symptoms in genetically susceptible patients confronting environmental allergens. In our study, aeroallergens were studied. As in other studies, aeroallergens especially botanical allergens were shown to be the most common allergens both in Seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis with 86.5% sensitive to one or more aeroallergens and 76% sensitive to one or more botanical allergens.",

Introduction: there are no acceptable criteria for distinguishing between allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and para-clinical features of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Methods: in a retrospective study, we compared the clinical and para-clinical features of 442 allergic and 103 non allergic rhinitis patients (18Y50 year-old). The evaluations included respiratory signs and symptoms, lab tests, and respiratory function tests. Results: patients with allergic rhinitis had more signs and symptoms within their season in terms of cough, sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itchy eyes and nose, and respiratory function test (p G 0.001), whereas those with non-allergic rhinitis had more persistent symptoms, and headaches (p G 0.01). Food allergy, OR = 1.8, (1.4Y2.1), P G 0.01, serum Ig E, OR=2.1, (1.9Y2.19), P G 0.001, and airway hyperresponsiveness, OR=1.7 (1.4Y1.9), P G 0.01 were more common in patients with allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: our results indicate that the signs and symptoms have more fluctuation in allergic rhinitis, and more sever within their season. More studies with respect to both adults and children with rhinitis is recommended.",

Background: The aim of this study was to describe differences between allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) in a large communitybased sample of adolescents and adults. Methods: A total of 354 subjects, 10Y50 years of age, who in a screening questionnaire had reported a history of airway symptoms suggestive of asthma and/or allergy, or who were taking any medication for these conditions were clinically examined. All participants were interviewed about respiratory symptoms and furthermore skin test reactivity, lung function and airway responsiveness were measured using standard techniques. Results: A total of 64% of the subjects with rhinitis had AR, whereas 46% had NAR. Subjects with NAR were more likely to be females, OR = 2.13 (1.24Y3.22), P = 0.004, to have persistent symptoms within the last 6 weeks, OR = 1.87 (1.23Y2.65), P = 0.002, and to have recurring headaches, OR = 1.94, (1.34Y3.45), P = 0.021. On the other hand, subjects with NAR were less likely to have airway hyperresponsiveness, OR = 0.34, (0.32Y0.46), P G 0.001, food allergy, OR = 0.32, (0.18Y0.33), P = 0.007 and to have been treated with antihistamines in the last 6 weeks, OR = 0.23, (0.22Y0.35), P G 0.002 compared with subjects with AR. Subjects with AR were symptomatically worse within their season in terms of sneezing (P G 0.002) and itchy eyes (P G 0.002), compared to subjects with NAR, whereas nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were equally frequent in the two groups (P = 0.32 and P = 0.44, respectively). Conclusion: The proportion of subjects with NAR in an adolescent and adult population with rhinitis is around one-fourth. Women have NAR twice as often as men. In general, subjects with NAR have more persistent but equally severe symptoms compared to subjects with AR. However, subjects with allergic rhinitis have more sneezing and itchy eyes within their particular season of allergy compared to subjects with nonallergic rhinitis.",

Inflamm Res 2005 , Frossard et al. Br J Clin Pharm 2007 . The purpose of this study is to assess whether this is valid also for other pharmacodynamic models such as that scoring the symptoms of SAR in ragweed sensitive subjects exposed to ragweed pollen in an EEU. Methods: 119 subjects (mean age 34 yrs, mean bodyweight 81 kg) were exposed to pollen in the EEU at 9 am of Day 1. At 11 am, they received a single dose of 5mg L and remained in the EEU until 4 pm. On Day 2, subjects were exposed again to pollen in the EEU from 8 am until noon. The primary efficacy variable was the reduction from baseline in the Major Symptoms Complex (MSC) score (calculated as the sum of the following 6 symptoms: runny nose, itchy nose, sniffles, nose blows, sneezes and watery eyes). Baseline value was the MSC score before drug administration (9Y11 am of Day 1). The MSC score was evaluated at different times after L administration (see table) . Plasma concentrations at different times after administration of a single dose of 10 mg L were obtained from a study in 24 healthy volunteers (mean age 35 yrs, mean bodyweight 67 kg) (Baltes et al. Fund Clin Pharm 2001) , normalized to the therapeutic dose of 5 mg (see table) . The plasma protein binding data of L come from Bree et al. (Fund Clin Pharm 2002) . The RO has been calculated as described by Gillard et al. (Inflamm Res 2005) . Results: The kinetics of change from baseline in MSC score fit much better with those of RO than with those of free plasma concentrations (see table) . It is possible however that the free plasma concentrations of L do not represent those at the receptor at very short times and that the RO values calculated are over-estimated at these times. It is also possible that there is a lag time between the RO and the relief of some of the symptoms. Conclusion: the EEU model confirms previous results that the kinetics of RO by L are a better predictor of the efficacy of the drug than are plasma pharmacokinetics.",

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma share many similarities in their inflammatory response but epithelial shedding, basement membrane thickening and fibrosis are not seen in AR. By contrast, nasal polyps share some features with asthma. As in asthma, we demonstrated an increased expression of MMP-9 and low TIMP in nasal polyps. We hypothesized that the differential expression of MMPs may at least in part contribute to the differences between AR and asthma. Methods: We performed nasal allergen challenge (NAC) in AR patients with mite allergen disks and control disks and analyzed the number of MMP 2, 9, 13 and TIMP 1,2 in nasal biopsies at 30 min, 6 hrs and 12 hrs post challenge. By ELISA, we examined the levels of MMP-2, 9 and 13, and TIMP1,2 in the nasal mucosa of AR patients. Results: At 30 min post NAC, MMP-2 and 13 were increased. At 6 hrs post NAC, MMP-2 and at 12 hours post NAC, MMP-2 and 13 were significantly increased. TIMP-1 was increased at 30 min. At 30 min and 12 hr post NAC, the MMP 2 : TIMP1,2 and MMP-13 : TIMP1,2 ratio was high. The levels of MMP-2 and 13 but not MMP-9 were high in the allergic nasal mucosa. Conclusion: These results suggest that MMP-2 and 13 may play an important role in the pathomechanisms of allergic rhinitis and that this differential expression of MMP may contribute at least in part contribute to the differences between AR and asthma.",

We previously reported that nasal mast cells express CCR3 and exhibit increased chemotaxis to RANTES suggesting a role for RANTES in mast cell migration. To further confirm this, in the present study we examined the levels of RANTES, eotaxin and SCF in the epithelium and lamina propria of patients with AR and the kinetics of RANTES+, tryptase+, and CCR3+ cells in the epithelium and lamina propria after nasal allergen challenge. Methods: By ELISA, we examined the levels of RANTES, eotaxin and SCF in homogenized nasal scrapings and lamina propria of AR patients. In AR patients, we performed nasal allergen challenge with house dust mite, took biopsies at 30 min, 6 hrs, and 12 hrs and by immunohistochemistry, we examined the number of Tryptase+ RANTES+, eotaxin+ and CCR3+ cells as compared to control. Results: The levels of RANTES, but not Eotaxin and SCF was greater in the epithelium than in the lamina propria. At 30 minutes after nasal allergen challenge, Tryptase+, RANTES+ and CCR3+ cells were increased in the epithelium. At six hours post challenge, Tryptase+ and RANTES+ cells were increased in the epithelium but at 12 hrs only an increase in Tryptase+ cells was detected. Conclusion: Migration of the mast cells in the allergic nasal epithelium occurred as early as 30 min with a parallel increase in CCR3+ and RANTES+ cells. These results further confirm that RANTES is one of the critical factors regulating mast cell migration into the allergic nasal epithelium.

Methods: CHOhOCT2 cells were seeded in 12 well plates and grown to confluence. Once confluent, transport experiments were conducted. Transport buffer containing [ 3 H]TEA, and levocetirizine, dextrocetirizine or positive control (cimetidine) were added to the wells.

The IC 50 value for inhibition of tetraethylammonium transport by levocetirizine is more than 300 fold the C max (0.66 6M) at steady state following the therapeutic dose of 5 mg. It is unlikely that levocetirizine can cause drug interactions by interference with renal elimination through inhibition of renal OCT2.

Yamagata Univ., School of Medicine, Department of Otolaryngology, Yamagata, Japan. Background: Glucocorticoid (GC) has been commonly used as an antiinflammatory reagent in the treatment of chronic allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis. The effects of GC are mediated by glucocorticoid receptor-\" (GR-\"). Upon binding GC, activated GR-\" can not only enhance transcription of anti-inflammatory genes but also interact with other protein regulating inflammation, such as nuclear factor-0B (NF-0B). However, these clinical benefits are sometimes limited because some patients demonstrate persistent tissue inflammation despite treatment with high doses of GC. It is generally considered that the interference of non-functional GR variants in immune cells may result in GC-resistance. GR-$ is a well-known natural spliced variant consisting of 742 amino acids including exon 2-8 and part of 9$ as coding region, but cannot bind to GC. It has been reported that there was an increase of GR-$ expression in patients with bronchial asthma and in ulcerative colitis patients who did not respond to GC administration. We have tested this hypothesis by investigating correlation between the expression of GR-\", GR-$, and NF-0B proteins in patients with allergic rhinitis and the responsiveness to GC treatment.",

Introduction: Non-allergic rhinitis is a condition which affects 30 to 50% of patients with perennial nasal symptoms, occurring either alone or in conjunction with allergic rhinitis. Neural mechanisms may have a role in this condition. This study assesses the impact of intranasal azelastine on the concentration of substance P (SP) in nasal lavage fluid. Methods: 28 patients were defined as having non-allergic rhinitis by history, examination in addition to the presence of negative skin prick tests using common inhalant allergens and low total IgE using the Phadia CAP. 16/28 patients were treated with intranasal azelastine two sprays twice daily for 10 days. The control group consisted of 12 patients with non-allergic rhinitis who used a saline nasal spray, 2 sprays twice a day. Nasal lavages were performed before and after a 10 day treatment period with intranasal azelastine or control saline nasal spray. The concentration of SP in nasal lavage fluid was determined by an EIA (Assay Designs Inc., USA) method. All patients recorded their nasal symptoms daily, including rhinorrhea, sneezing, pruritus, and congestion, using a Visual Rating Scale (VRS).",

Significantly lower concentrations of substance P were noted in nasal lavage fluid after 10 days of azelastine treatment (73.2 T 16.9 pg/mL) when compared with placebo treatment (83.1 T 17.8 pg/mL). The differences between the azelastine and the placebo treated group VRS symptom scores (6.4 T 2.4 versus 8.6 T 3.2) were also statistically significant demonstrating that the reduction in nasal lavage SP levels occurred in conjunction with improvement in clinical symptoms. Conclusion: Intranasal azelastine reduces substance P release into nasal lavage fluid of non-allergic rhinitis patients associated with clinical improvement during a 10 day treatment period. The efficacy of azelastine in perennial non-allergic rhinitis may be related to reduction of release of SP and other non-adrenergic non-cholinergic neural mediators into nasal secretions.",

Background: Pregnancy rhinitis, a common condition, is thought to affect 18Y30 % of pregnant women. It is very annoying for many women, may develop at any time during pregnancy and usually disappears shortly after delivery. The cause is not known and it may be due to hormonal factors. Some data have shown that there may be a relation between high estrogen levels and nasal mucosal reactivity. The knowledge of the etiology of this condition is important since no satisfactory treatment is available. The aim of this study was to determine whether nasal mucosal reactivity and microcirculation change with various levels of estrogen in the blood, but constant levels of other hormones. Methods: 15 women who were undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) were included. The examination and measurements of the nasal mucosa were done in the first part when the concentrations of estrogen in the blood are extremely low and then, when the concentrations of estrogen is high. The nasal mucosa was studied with a combination of rhinostereometry and laser-Doppler flowmetry during challenge with histamine. The swelling of the nasal mucosa was recorded with rhinostereometry. This optical, direct, non-invasive method is designed to measure nasal mucosal swelling with a high degree of accuracy. Laser-Doppler flowmetry, a non-invasive method for studying the microcirculation, is providing continuous and instantaneous measurements of nasal mucosal blood flow. The combination of rhinostereometry and Laser-Doppler flowmetry has the advantage of using two non-invasive methods which permit direct and simultaneous measurements of congestion and the microcirculation. Results: With rhinostereometry we found an increase in nasal mucosal swelling after histamine challenge when the estrogen levels in blood were high. With laser-Doppler flowmetry the increases of the microcirculatory parameters velocity of moving blood cells and perfusion were lower when the estrogen levels in blood were high. Conclusion: High levels of estrogen in blood during IVF treatment of healthy women may induce nasal hyperreactivity and changes in microcirculation. This suggests that estrogen plays a role in pregnancy rhinitis.",

Individual nasal and ocular symptoms were scored by patients each on a 4-point categorical scale (0 = none to 3 = severe) each morning and evening. Nasal and ocular efficacy was evaluated by the mean change from baseline over the 2-week treatment period in daily reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS; average of AM and PM score totals for nasal congestion, nasal itching, rhinorrhoea, and sneezing) and daily reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score (rTOSS; average of AM and PM score totals for eye itching/burning, tearing/watering, and redness). The AM pre-dose instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) and Total Ocular Symptom Score (iTOSS) were also assessed as a measure of 24-hour symptom control. Results: Significant and consistently greater improvements in rTNSS were seen with FFNS than with placebo across all four studies ( Background: The safety profile of the novel enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid fluticasone furoate (FF) administered using a unique, side-actuated device has been investigated in children with perennial (PAR) and/or seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Methods: Safety was evaluated in an integrated analysis of data from three randomised, double-blind, parallel-group studies in 1224 paediatric patients aged 2Y11 years with SAR or PAR. Patients received once-daily FF nasal spray (FFNS) 55 6g (n = 369) or 110 6g (n = 426), or placebo (n = 429) for 2 weeks (SAR study) or 6 or 12 weeks (PAR studies). Assessments included evaluation of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, nasal examinations, ophthalmic examinations (12 week PAR study only) and electrocardiograms (ECGs). In the 6-week study, the effects of once-daily FFNS 110 6g on 24-hour serum cortisol (SC) was assessed in a domicile setting in patients with PAR. Results: No safety or tolerability issues were identified in paediatric patients with PAR or SAR. In the integrated analysis, the most common AEs with an incidence of 93% and more common in FFNS than in placebo were headache, nasopharyngitis, epistaxis, pyrexia and pharyngolaryngeal pain. The incidences of drug-related AEs were similar across the FFNS 55 6g and 110 6g treatment and placebo groups: epistaxis was reported in 4%, 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, and headache in 2%, G1% and 1% of patients, respectively. Data from the 6-week PAR study demonstrate that SC levels following administration of FFNS 110 6g were similar to those following placebo (least squared means, 0.94 vs 0.97; treatment ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.88, 1.07) which suggests that FFNS 110 6g is not associated with any effect on the HPA axis. In addition, plasma levels of FF were non-quantifiable. Conclusion: Once-daily FFNS 55 6g or 110 6g has a favourable safety and tolerability profile in children aged 2Y11 years with PAR or SAR. Furthermore, FFNS shows low systemic exposure and is not associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression in children aged 2Y11 years with PAR.",

This study investigated the long-term safety and tolerability of fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS) over 12 months in adults and adolescents with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). Methods: Following a 7-to 14-day screening period, patients aged Q12 years with PAR were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to double-blind treatment with oncedaily FFNS 1106g (n = 605) or vehicle placebo nasal spray (n = 201) for 12 months. Adverse event (AE) data were collected using diary cards and interviews at each study visit; the investigator graded AE severity as mild, moderate or severe, and assessed the relationship of each AE to the administration of study treatment. Safety was assessed by 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion, nasal and ophthalmic examinations, ECGs and clinical laboratory testing. Plasma levels of FF were determined from blood samples. Compliance was measured using diary cards, change in bottle weights, and symptom scores. Results: 592 patients (73%) completed the study. Demographic characteristics were similar in treatment and placebo groups. FFNS was well tolerated: the incidence of most AEs in the FFNS group was similar to that in the placebo group, with the exception of epistaxis (defined as any observation of blood in or from the nose, irrespective of quantity), which was more frequent in FFNS than placebo recipients (20% vs 8%). There were no other clinically meaningful differences between FFNS and placebo in terms of safety assessments, including 24-hour urine cortisol excretion, mean ophthalmic parameters, ECGs and clinical laboratory tests. Plasma levels of FF were not quantifiable in the majority of patients following administration of FFNS. Compliance with study treatment was high based on diary cards (85% of patients had 990% compliance) and bottle weights. Over the treatment period, improvements in reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score were greater with FFNS (j3.37) than with placebo (j2.49). Conclusion: Long-term (12-month) administration of FFNS 1106g once daily in adult and adolescent patients with PAR revealed a safety profile typical of intranasal corticosteroids as a class, with no evidence of clinically relevant systemic corticosteroid exposure.",

Currently, there is only one questionnaire based study (International Study of Asthma and Allergies-ISAAC) in children documented in Kenya. Objectives: The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in Kenya Medical Training College students, aged 18Y50 years. The other objectives were; to determine the severity, pattern of symptomatology and the common aeroallergens involved in the study group. Methods: The study was done in two steps. In stage 1, using a stratified random sampling, 423 students were screened for symptoms of allergic rhinitis based on International Consesus Report definition of rhinitis. In stage 2, the positive responders (63 students) were subjected to a physical examination and a skin prick test to confirm presence of allergic rhinitis. Results: A point prevalence rate of 13% was found with no sex or age predilection in the study group. The average age of onset was 15.2 years,seasonal peaks were in January, July and December. 81.8% of the students with allergic rhinitis had their daily activity affected to a certain degree. Sneezing (83.6%) was the commonest smptom and hypertrophied inferior turbinates (70.9%) the commonest physical finding. Patients with intermittent disease (73%) were the most, while 36% of the students with allergic rhinitis had a family history of atopy. The commonest aeroallergen was the house dust mite (76.4%) and the least was Aspergillus Niger (1.8%). Conclusion: Allergic rhinitis affects a significant proportion of the college students and has symptoms which have an impact on the lifestyles of these patients.

Background: Nasal polyposis (NP) often coexists with asthma and rhinitis. Polyp histology typically shows chronic, eosinophilic inflammation including eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells and mast cells. We studied mediator levels and leukocyte values in nasal fluids (NFs) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), total IgE levels and eosinophils in the blood in both allergic and non-allergic patients with NP and in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). Methods: Forty-six patients with NP and 37 patients with AR as a control group: 15 patients with seasonal AR to grass pollen, 12 with AR sensitive to Parietaria and 10 with AR sensitive to house dust mite (HDM) entered the study. Twenty-one patients with NP were also allergic patients (11 were sensitive to Parietaria and 10 -to HDM), whereas 25 were non-allergic patients. Tryptase and histamine values were assayed in NFs, total IgE was determined in serum. ECP values were assayed both in NF and serum. Eosinophils were quantified both in the blood and NFs. Results: Tryptase levels were significantly higher in the NFs from patients with NP than in those from patients without NP (3.9 vs. 3.5 U/l, p G 0.001) and correlated with symptom scores (r(s) = 0.36, p G 0.0001). The median levels of histamine in NFs from patients with NP were significantly higher than those in patients without NP (40.0 vs.19.4 ng/ml, p G 0.001), but did not correlate with symptom scores. The median levels of ECP in NFs from patients with NP were significantly higher than those in patients without NP (37.4 vs. 17.2 ng/ml, p G 0.001) and correlated with symptom scores (r(s) = 0.33, p G 0.001). With regard to leukocyte counts in NFs, no significant differences were between rhinitis patients with NP and those without NP. With regard to serum ECP and serum total IgE, no significant differences were detected between the two groups. Blood eosinophil levels in patients with NP were significantly higher than those in patients without NP (5.7 vs. 5.5, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Chronic eosinophil mucosal inflammatory disease in NP involves a self-sustaining mechanism independent of allergen stimulation of nasal mucosa. Increased release of inflammatory mediators contributes to the development of NP, determining oedema and an increased recruitment of inflammatory cells. Eosinophils, mast cells also play a key role in this process.",

University of Cologne, IMSIE, Cologne, Germany. Background: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an allergy associated with a high burden of costs. This disease is also considered an important risk factor in the development of asthma. Within a time slot of 10 years, 20Y40% of rhinitis patients develop asthma. The ARIA guidelines, introduced in 2001, address this problem and make treatment recommendations for allergic rhinitis based on the concept Bone airway, one disease.[ Several studies have investigated the implementation process of these guidelines and have stressed their suitability for daily use. Methods: The objective of the present analysis was to estimate the compliance with and the acceptability of international guidelines among ENT specialists and general practitioners when treating patients with allergic rhinitis. For this purpose, we examined data from 122,000 patients using an IPD meta-analysis from seven post-marketing surveys collected from 1998 to 2005. Results: First, we investigated the data pool as a whole, and the results showed that 38% of the patients who were treated by ENT specialists received therapy according to these international guidelines. In contrast, only 16.3% of the general practitioners heeded the guideline recommendations. Next, we examined the time line in general, regardless of the physician`s specialty. We observed that the rate of compliance and acceptability in 2002 was higher than that in previous years. Moreover, in more than 50% of cases the patients with rhinitis and concomitant asthma were treated by their ENT specialists according to the ARIA guidelines. Conclusion: The results are evidence of the well-structured and successful implementation process of the ARIA guidelines. ENT specialists could apply the recommendations in practice more easily as compared to other guidelines. However, the investigation also shows that the ARIA document has not yet found its way into the daily routine of general practitioners. This finding thus supports the goals set by the BInternational Primary Care Respiratory Group[ for implementing special guidelines for general practitioners in the primary care setting.",

Background: Pollinosis is seasonal allergic rhinitis due to pollen antigens, and its prevalence is high enough to be called a national disease in Japan. Among the many pollen antigens, Japanese cedar pollinosis is the most common. A pollen exposure chamber (OHIO Chamber) was built in central Tokyo, Japan, in order to study seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Epinastine hydrochloride (epinastine), the second-generation antihistamines, is largely used in the indication of allergic rhinitis in Japan. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective efficacy of epinastine in patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis in an artificial pollen exposure chamber (OHIO Chamber). Methods: The study was designed as a double-blind study. After preliminary study, 20 volunteers were initially exposed to a low concentration (4500 grains/m3) of JC for at most 1 hour in this chamber, volunteers were randomized into 2 groups (group A and group B) and allocated to receive either epinastine 20 mg tablets or a placebo tablets once a day for 2 weeks. At the end of 1 week interventional period, volunteers were exposed to a low concentration (4500 grains/m3) of JC for 2 hours. And then at the end of another 1 week interventional period, volunteers were exposed to a high concentration (6000 grains/m3) of JC for 2 hours again. Subjective nasal and ocular symptoms were recorded at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes using personal computer systems and the amount of nasal secretion was measured during the allergen exposure periods. Results: Total symptom scores (TSS) in epinastine group was significantly lower than in placebo group during low concentration of JC exposed. However during high concentration of JC exposed, significant differences in TSS were not observed. Conclusion: This is the first clinical study using Japanese cedar pollen under well-controlled conditions in the OHIO chamber. This study showed that 20mg of epinastine once daily reduced the severity of allergic symptoms compared with that once in a week or placebo in pollen season.",

Background: Patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) consider ease of use to be the most important feature of prescription nasal sprays, with formulation-related attributes (e.g. medication that runs down the throat/out the nose and bitter taste) being key barriers to continued use. Thus, improved delivery systems and formulations may help improve adherence to nasal spray treatment. Methods: The fluticasone Furoate nasal spray (FFNS) device was designed for optimal ergonomics. Following a review of published data, key dimensions and operational ranges required for device operation were determined, and device concepts were modelled and evaluated by user groups, whose feedback was used to refine and finalise the design. The reliability of device was tested in vitro, and its ease of use was assessed in a Phase III clinical study in 302 patients with AR. The delivery system was developed with minimal steps for use, to be suitable for use by a wide patient population, for easier third-party administration and to allow determination of medication remaining in the pack. Results: In vitro tests confirmed that the FFNS device is robust, operates reliably when a force of 25Y45N is applied to the side lever, and delivers a consistent dose, even when left unused for 6 weeks. A low-dose volume (50 6L) is delivered as a fine mist which consistently delivers 27.5 6g/spray and minimises the amount of formulation available to run down the back of the throat or drip from the nostrils. In a Phase III clinical study, 84% of 302 patients found the device easy to use, 95% found it easy to carry, and 97% found the drug product comfortable to use. In addition, a review by an independent ergonomist concluded that the FFNS device is more comfortable to hold and easier to operate than current Btop-down[ nasal spray devices and is suitable for use in children as young as 2 years. The unique side-actuated delivery mechanism also allows for easier third-party administration. Conclusion: The novel FFNS device is easy to use, delivers a consistent dose, and addresses patient-reported barriers to the use of existing nasal sprays. Methods: Total 227 patients, visited us for AR without BA (2001~2004), were enrolled in 2006. We reviewed their clinical data and followed them up with a BA-detecting questionnaire, based on International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG) guidelines 2005. These results were statistically analyzed. Results: Among 227 (215 loss to f/u, 12 regular visitors), 91 responded to the questionnaire (85 by phone, 6 via mail). 37 responders, who answered yes to either doctor-diagnosed asthma or any of 4 pivotal IPCRG questions, were suspected as the group with subsequent development of BA (BAS). BAS showed higher female rate (73%) than non-suspected group (NBAS, 54%). In BAS, males were younger and females had higher BMI than NBAS (p G 0.01, respectively). Familial allergic diseases (36.8%) and nasal polyp/surgery were more frequent in BAS. BAS had longer AR duration (10.7T10.1 yrs) than NBAS (6.3 T 4.5 yrs). According to the increase of AR duration, BAS (%) increased linearly (p = 0.012). Current AR symptoms were more prevalent in BAS (89.2%, NBAS 64.8%). Atopic tendency, skin test results, serum total IgE, and induced sputum eosinophil (%) were not different between both groups. In pulmonary function test, BAS males showed lower initial FEV1 (L) and FVC (L) (p G 0.05, respectively). In initial methacholine challenge test (M-test), airway hyperreactivity (AHR: PC20 G 25 mg/mL) were more common in BAS (93.7%, NBAS 33.3%). Conclusion: 40.7% of AR patients (mean duration 8.0=57.5 years) were suspected to develop subsequent BA. Such progression might be suggested by female gender, younger age in male, higher BMI in female, longer AR duration, and more frequent AHR positive results in initial M-test. AR patients without lower respiratory symptom should be followed up regularly for early diagnosis of subsequent BA.",

We evaluated the NO in nasal mucus and sera, from 144 Venezuelan scholar children (6Y12 years old), from low to middle socioeconomic background covering different areas from Caracas, Venezuela, with allergic rhinitis and bronquial asthma. Methods: All children were evaluated with a validated modified Graffar's socioeconomic questionnaire and an allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis after ARIA, GINA and Hannifin criteria; skin prick testing (ALK-ABELLO) for common food and inhalant allergens plus total IgE (ELISA), complete blood count (COULTER) and serial feces examination for ova and parasites were performed in all children. Pre and post bronchodilator FEV1 and PEF spirometric measurements values were obtained (MICROLOOP) (we obtained the approval by the ethical committee of the Institute of Biomedicine, ratified by the academic council of the medical Faculty of Central University of Venezuela, After an informed consent was signed from parents or guardians). In nasal mucus and sera from children NO were detected by a simple colorimetric method based on Griess Methodology. Results: According to clinical evaluation children's were classified in four group. Healthy children's, children's with rhinitis and without asthma, children's with asthma and without rhinitis, and children's with asthma plus rhinitis. Healthy children present lower NO value both in sera (X = 34,482M) and nasal mucus (X = 7,992M). Rhinitis children had the higher NO levels both in sera than in nasal mucus, finding statistical differences in nasal mucus levels (21.232M) compare to control group (7,992M). In asthmatic children NO levels were lower than in rhinitis once, but higher than healthy control group. Conclusion: In nasal mucus, the study of immune parameter as nitric oxide by a rapid and simple methodology, could clarify the local inflammatory process related to allergic rhinitis in order to bring better strategies for the diagnosis and also for the evolution of the treatment.",

Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Koshigaya, Japan. Background: It is wellknown that the basic protein of eosinophils induce respiratory epitherial disorders. The eosinophils which migrate to nasal mucosa do not return again into the circulating blood stream. It has been reported that eosinophils into nasal mucosa and mucus were degranulated by cytolysis. It is preferable treatment of allergy that the eosinophils are promptly excluded nasal mucosa without degranulation. It is aspired that the eosinophils induced to apoptosis not but necrosis. Methods: After the polyp was taken from the right nostril of the patient in whose mucus many eosinophils were observed, corticosteroid was injected into the polyp of left nostril. Two days after the steroid injecion, the polyp of the left nostril was taken. The both side polyps were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 hour and postfixed with 2% osmic acid for 40 minutes and embedded in Epon 812. Ultrathin cross sections were prepared and observed under transmission electron microscope. The total numbers of eosinophils and macrophages with and without phagocytosing eosinophils. In some ulrathin cross section, the localizaion of ss-DNAwas examined which was a mark of apoptosis. Results: The nucleus of eosinophils showed typical characteristics of apoptpsis but apoptoic bodies were not observed after the steroid injection. The ss-DNA was admitted in the part of heterochromatin of the nucleus, which proved apoptosis had been caused. It has been known that the cells are phagocytosed by macrophages as soon as they were induced to apoptosis. There was not a significant difference in the number of total eosinophils and macrophages in the polyp before and after the steroid administration, but the rate of eosinophil phagocytosis by macrophage significantly increased after the steroid administration. Conclusion: It was clalified that eosinophils were induced to apoptosis after the steroid administration by the feature of nucleus with electron microscope and proof of ss-DNA. Eosinophils which had induced to apoptosis were promptly phagocytosed by macrophages.",

University of Medicine and Pharmacy BIuliu HaSieganu^, 3rd Medical Clinic, Allergology, Cluj Napoca, Romania. Background: Moderate/severe allergic rhinitis (MSAR) is an affection of nasal mucosa induced by allergen exposure and produced by a specific IgE mediated chronic inflammation. Symptoms are present in over 4 days in a week, and over 4 weeks (ARIA guide), and the symptoms interfering with activities and sleep. It is related that MSAR has a 10Y25% incidence from all allergic rhinitis, it is more frequent in adolescent and young people (who, usually don`t have the financial resources for the therapy: topical corticosteroids, immunotherapy). SMAR patients have a reduce quality of life, and by absenteeism and costs this seems to be an important health problem. Methods: The aim of this study is to evaluate 40 patients with SMAR that last over a year, for 8 months (age between 9 and 57 years, medium age 33.85). Our patients have completed questionnaires about their nasal symptoms and the effect of the treatment (antihistamines, topical corticosteroids and immunotherapy. They were evaluated by skin prick tests to 10 inhaled allergens, rhinoscopy for nasal mucosa and questionnaires for the symptoms score. Results: The majority of MSAR have a polisensitization (80%: to dust mites 90.62%, to cat 37.5%, to pollen 37.5%, to cockroach 37.5%, to moulds 37.5%, to dog 18.75%). Only 20% from our patients have monosensitization (to house dust mites). The score of the symptoms was high-over 4 on a day in 4 days from the last 7 days-we evaluated the nasal congestion, rhinoreea, nasal itching and sneeze by 0 to 3. Antihystamines therapy has a lower efficiency-to one patient (3.12%) -in polisensitization patients, and in those with severe congestion has practically no effect, in 26 patients none feels better. The only therapeutic method with higher efficiency was topical corticosteroids, witch make an obvious amelioration, the score of the symptoms decreased between 0 and 2 on a day in 7 days. The financial aspect of the patients with MSAR showed that only a few from them could provide the topical corticosteroid for at least 3 months (12.5%-5 patients). Conclusion: MSAR is hard to be treated and controlled without topical corticosteroids.",

Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., Pharmaceutical Research Center, Shizuoka, Japan. Background: The main symptoms of allergic rhinitis are sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction. In patients with AR, the levels of neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) and neuropeptides substance P (SP) increased. Therefore, they are considered important modulators in the development of AR. Olopatadine hydrochloride (olopatadine), is an anti-allergic agent with histamine H1 receptor antagonistic action. We reported that olopatadine inhibited the elevated levels of NGF and SP in the mouse model of chronic inflammatory dermatitis. Objective: To investigate whether olopatadine has an effect on the production of NGF and SP, we used TDI-sensitized rats as an animal model of nasal allergy. Methods: After the intranasal challenge of TDI, the numbers of sneezes were counted in a blinded way. To determine NGF and SP production in the nasal lavage fluids (NALF), rats were anesthetized and nasal lavages were done. Olopatadine was orally administered orally before the nasal instillation of TDI. Results: In TDI-challenged rats, nasal allergy-like behavior (sneezing, rhinorrhea and inflammation) was provoked after TDI challenge. The amounts of NGF and SP in the NALF were increased. Olopatadine reduced nasal allergy-like behavior. Moreover olopatadine inhibited the increases of NGF and SP production. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the increase of NGF and SP production is one of the mechanisms responsible for nasal allergy-like behavior in TDIchallenged rats. These results suggest that the suppression of neurogenic inflammatory reaction might partially be involved in the improvement of allergy-like behavior by the treatment of olopatadine.",

Background: Nasal breathing is essential in maintaining the physiologic functions of the upper and lower airways. The predominant symptom of allergic rhinitis is nasal congestion, which also has a significant impact on quality of life and work productivity. In patients who suffer from persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR), a severe drug-resistant hypertrophy and increase in glandular structures of the inferior turbinates may develop, which leads to constant nasal obstruction. Objective methods are strongly recommended for use in the evaluation of pharmacologic agents that are expected to improve nasal airflow. Methods: This prospective, single-sited study randomized 50 patients with mild or moderate PAR who had substantial bilateral hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates to desloratadine (5 mg/day) or additional mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray (MFMNS), (2 sprays per nostril [total dose 200 6g] once daily) treatment groups. Patients with previous treatments, concomitant sinonasal disorders or systemic diseases were excluded. Both objective outcomes evaluated by total nasal resistance at anterior rhinomanometry and subjective outcomes assessed with endoscopic nasal examination and Quality of Life Questionnaire were analyzed before and at least 12 months after treatment. Results: The median total nasal resistance in patients treated with MFMNS decreased from 0,49T0,17 Pa/cm3/s to 0,39 Pa/cm3/s (p = 0,42), and at least 12 months later. Compared with pretreatment scores, the post treatment scores of these patients significantly improved in both 7 separate domain scores and overall Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire scores (p = 0,004). Nasal symptomatology was reduced 2 months after MFMNS application. No adverse reactions including bleeding, infection, or hormonal disorders were encountered. The patients experienced a lasting benefit from this treatment. Conclusion: Nasal congestion affects most individuals with allergic rhinitis, and has a notable impact on quality of life, emotional function, productivity, and the ability to perform daily activities. These results suggest that topical mometasone reduces the volume of inferior turbinate at some point while significantly improving the quality of life in patients with PAR. Histopathologic and longer term studies with larger groups will enlighten the potential and mechanism of efficacy of topical steroid in management of inferior turbinate hypertrophy in patients with PAR. Topical treatment for perennial allergic rhinitis in children Felicia Manole. Faculty of Medicine Oradea, Otorhinolaryngology, Oradea, Romania. Background: Topical corticosteroid is now accepted as safe and most effective in controlling all symptoms of both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. Mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray is a once daily topical corticosteroid preparation. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray in children 6 to 12 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis. Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group of 112 recruited patients of whom 96 were evaluated. Treatment with once daily mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray 100 mcg once daily or placebo for 6 weeks followed by a 3-week follow-up period. Forty-eight patients of each group were treated with mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray or placebo by randomized assignment. Results: There was no statistical significance of the sex, mean age, weight, and height of the two groups. Patients treated with mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray showed a significant decrease in total symptom scores rated by physicians at 3 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively (P G .01, P G .05). The rhinitis symptom scores in treatment group rated by patients (nasal blockage, sneezing, watery rhinorrhea) were significantly decreased at 3 weeks (P G .05, P G .01). Nasal symptoms as assessed by doctors (turbinate swelling, color of nasal mucosa, secretion, and postnasal drip) also decreased at 3 and 6 weeks, but were not statistically significant, except for the secretion at 3 weeks and postnasal drip at 6 weeks (P G .05). There was no evidence of effects on adrenal function by morning plasma cortisol concentration between the two groups. Conclusion: Mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray was safe and effective, well tolerated in children aged 6 to 12 years with perennial allergic rhinitis with incidences of adverse events comparable to placebo.",

Methods: Symptomatic ragweed allergic rhinitis patients on no medications and healthy control subjects completed the Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory and the Positive Affect-Negative Affect mood rating scales in an in-out-in ragweed season research design. Results: During ragweed seasons, allergic patients reported higher levels of general fatigue and mental fatigue, but not physical fatigue, as well as reduced motivation. Patients described experiencing feelings of greater sadness and reduced pleasurable engagement. Increased anxiety or emotional distress was not reported. Conclusion: These findings suggest that having allergic reactions to ragweed pollen causes significant fatigue and mood changes in at least a subgroup of patients.

In PAR patients along with atopic bronchial asthma (n = 42) rising Staphylococcus haemolyticus titers-24% (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus-33% (n = 14) was observed. In 6 out of 14 patients isolated Staphylococcus a ureus strain was combined with Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp. Isolation of permissible for normal microflora values was equal to 19% for Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 8); and 16,7% (n = 7) for Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in 3 patients. In the group of PAR patients along with atopic dermatitis (n = 9), Staphylococcus aureus (in 7 patients under study) was the main representative of the nasal cavity microbiocenosis. Conclusion: Prevalence of staphylococcal found out in the course of study in nasal cavity of PAR patients may suqgest the ability of these microorganisms to support allergic inflammation.",

Previous studies showed that aspirin-lysine topical desensitization may be effective to CRS and NP treatment and prevent recurrent NP. The Aim of the Study: To evaluate the efficacy of topical desensitization by sodium diclofenac in patients (SD) with NSAID's hypersensitivity and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Methods: Ten subjects (5 male and 5 female, mean age 52.5 T 2.1 years) after intranasal polypotomy with positive results of nasal challenge with SD underwent topical SD desensitization and daily treatment with SD 20 mg during 1 year. Additionally 5 patients were receiving intranasal corticosteroids in stable dose. Results: There were significant reductions of the total endoscope count (10.4 T 2.8 to 5.8 T 1.9, p G 0.05) and nasal symptom score (6.6 T 2.2 to 3.2 T 0.8, p G 0.05) in the subgroup with combination desensitization and topical corticosteroid therapy. In both subgroups there were improvement of nasal inspiratory peak flow (75,0 T 13,8 l/min to 86,5 T 9,2 l/min, p G 0.05) and pulmonary function. Using of inhalation corticosteroids were decreased. There were no recurrences of nasal polyposis in all patients after one year observation. Conclusion: Topical sodium diclofenac desensitization is an effective treatment in chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis with association NSAID's-hypersensitivity.",

Background: Nasal polyposis is a chronic disease of nose and sinuses. Its actual causes remain unclear. Mammaglobins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps. However, their association with the occurrence of nasal polyps in the presence of allergic rhinitis has not been explored. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the expression levels of mammaglobins A and B between the nasal polyps with allergic rhinitis and without allergic rhinitis. Methods: 31 patients with bilateral nasal polyposis underwent skin prick test to specific aeroallergens. Nasal polyp tissues were obtained from all patients and divided into 2 groups as nasal polyps with allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps without allergic rhinitis depending on the skin prick tests`results. All polyp tissues were analyzed for the levels of mammaglobin A and mammaglobin B by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique (RTQ-PCR). Results: Of the 16 samples from patients having nasal polyps with allergic rhinitis, only one expressed a detectable level of mammaglobin A (1/16). There was no detectable expression of mammaglobin A in tissues from the group of nasal polyps without allergic rhinitis (0/15). Expression of mammaglobin B was detected in all nasal polyp tissues from both groups. The mean expression of mammaglobin B was not significantly different between nasal polyps with allergic rhinitis (0.059; range 0.0002 to 0.343) and nasal polyps without allergic rhinitis (0.133; range 0.003Y0.628). Conclusion: Expressions of mammaglobins A and B are not different between nasal polyps with and without allergic rhinitis. Our findings suggest that mammaglobins`implication in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps is independent of an underlying allergic rhinitis.",

Faculty of Medicine Thammasat University, Department of Pediatrics, Pathumthani, Thailand. Backgroud: Sinusitis is a common disease in children. Even though new research findings are continually being published on various aspects of this disease, reports of its clinical characteristics and associated conditions are still limited. Objective: To describe the characteristics and associated conditions of acute sinusitis in Thai children. Materials and Methods: Our study consisted of 140 acute sinusitis patients who presented to Thammasat University Hospital. Acute sinusitis is diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation including persistent, severe or worsening nasal symptoms. An informed consent form was obtained from each patient before the study. Radiography has been used to aid in the diagnosis of acute sinusitis. Allergic skin prick test was also performed in this study. Results: Age range of the 140 patients were between 1.1 to 15 years with a mean (+/-SD) of 5.67 +/-2.85 years. History of allergic rhinitis, confirmed by positive skin prick test or nasal cytology, was found in 64%. The parental history of atopy was found in 50.4 %. Positive history of tobacco smoking was found in 25.9 %. Familial members with diagnosis of a cold or sinus infection during the same time was found in 43.2 %. 69.8% of the patients attended day care or school more than five days per week. 38.1% of the patients had a history of swimming or diving during the past 1 month. 51.8 % of the patients had a past history of sinus disease . The four most common symptoms were nasal blockage (88.5%), rhinorrhea (81.3%), nighttime cough (79.9%) and snoring (73.4%). The three most common signs were swelling of turbinates (75.5%), erythema of turbinates (74.8%) and tonsillar enlagement (48.2%). All paranasal sinuses X-rays were abnormal with maxillary sinus being the most commonly involved sinus (97.5%) followed by ethmoid sinus (58.8%). 58.8% of the patients had involvement of more than one sinus. Adenoid hypertrophy was positive in 36 % of all patients. The skin prick tests were positive in 62.6 % of all patients who the tests were performed. Conclusion: Nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, nighttime cough and snoring are very common in acute sinusitis. The present study demonstrates that allergic rhinitis and recurrent sinusitis is common in our patients.",

We have studied 80 patients aged between 8 and 16 diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in the period 2005Y2006. The associated diseases have been established: asthma, sinusitis, serous otitis media, hypertrophic chronic pharyngitis. Allergic rhinitis has been found to be perennial in 34 cases and seasonal in 46 cases. Associated sinusitis has been diagnosed in 42 patients, all of this have a high level of Ig E, from whom 28 patients had seasonal rhinitis. Main clinical symptoms: nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sneeze, headache, eye itching, cough, postnasal drip. Clinical and radiological examination (X-ray) of paranasal sinuses has shown the alteration of maxillary, ethmoidal and frontal sinus mucosa. The mucosa is swollen or with serous effusion. The results of the study demonstrate that: maxillary and ethmoidal sinusitis is predominating affected in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Radiological examination has shown predominant lesions of the type of sinusal swollen mucosa. Postnasal drip and cough associated with allergic rhinitis are indirect symptoms of the alteration of the paranasal sinuses. Allergic rhinitis in children must not be considered an isolated disorder, but must be considered in the context of a systemic allergic disorder. Sinus disorder in children is often misdiagnosed. Nasal mucosal edema at the level of the middle meatus favors associated sinus disorders.",

Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis exists in a high amount of asthma patients. It is still unknown whether a cause and effect relationship is present between the two diseases or they are the manifestations of the same underlying disease process affecting the whole respiratory tract. Objective: The aim of this study was to find out if sinus tissues in chronic rhinosinusitis have asthma related histological features such as eosinophilic inflamation and airway remodelling. Methods: The sinus tissues taken from 15 asthmatic patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and who had ungergone functional endoscopic sinus surgery were examined histologically. The patients did not have nasal polyposis. The 'Hematoxylin and eosin' staining was used to detect epithelial damage. Basement membrane thickening of the airway mucosa was evaluated with PAS staining. These two signs were accepted as signs of airway remodelling. Eosinophil semiquantitative scoring system (0Y4) was used to detect presence and amount of the eosinophils. Results: 15 patints with mean age of 37 T8.19 years were included in the study. 12 patients were female, 3 were male. 9 patients were found as atopic with skin prick test. 9 (60%) patients had epithelial damage with severe damage in 7 (46.6%). 11 (73.3%) patients had basement membrane thickening. 10 ( 66.6%) patients had eosinophils in the sinus tissue. 6 of these patients were allergic. The rate of allergy was the same in patients who had not eosinophils in sinus tissues. Conclusion: In patients with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, the histopathologic signs of asthma can also be seen in sinus tissues of the patients taken with functional endoscopic sinus surgery. This can be a clue of the same pathogenetic event of the whole respiratory tract.",

University of Torino -ASO Ordine Mauriziano, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Torino, Italy. Background: Rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), particularly with nasal polyps, are strong risk factors for asthma. Exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a reliable non-invasive marker of airway inflammation, is known to be elevated in patients with asthma and rhinitis. In this study we investigated inflammatory and functional airway involvement in patients with CRS. Methods: We recruited 47 patients with CRS, in all of them respiratory questionnaire, spirometry and FENO measurement (at constant flow of 50, 100 and 200 ml/sec) were obtained. Alveolar concentration (FANO) and maximal bronchial output (QbrMaxNO) of nitric oxide were calculated for each patient using a nonlinear model described by Silkoff et al. All patients with asthmalike symptoms were further investigated by methacholine inhalation challenge and/or bronchodilating test. Results: 19 (40.4%) of our patients met the functional and clinical criteria of asthma, and 34 (72.3%) had nasal polyps. Among the 28 patients without asthma, 11 (39.3%) complained asthma-like symptoms. FENO was higher in patients with asthma (63.9, I.C. 95%: 47Y81 ppb) and asthma-like symptoms with normal lung function (64.7, I.C. 95%: 39Y91 ppb), compared with those without asthmatic symptoms (29.8, I.C. 95%: 21Y39 ppb), pG0.01. All the three groups of patients had FENO higher than healthy controls (13.4, I.C. 95%: 6Y19 ppb, pG0.01). QbrMaxNO was more elevated in patients with asthmatic symptoms, with and without lung function criteria for asthma (3.2 , I.C. 95%: 2.3Y4.1nL/s and 3.5, I.C. 95%: 1.5Y5.6 nL/s respectively) compared with patients without asthma-like symptoms (1.9, I.C.95%: 1Y2.8 nL/s), p G 0.05. FANO was higher in patients with asthma-like symptoms but normal lung function (4.5, I.C. 95%: 2.4Y6.6 ppb) compared with those with asthma (2.4, I.C. 95%: 1.6Y3.4 ppb) and those without asthmatic symptoms (2.8, I.C. 95%: 1.1Y4.5 ppb), p=0.03. Conclusion: Patients with CRS showed higher levels of FENO compared to normal controls, suggesting a diffuse airway inflammation. FENO values were particularly elevated, with increased maximal bronchial output of nitric oxide, in patients with asthmatic symptoms, irrespectively of lung function (asthmatics or not), while alveolar concentration of nitric oxide was significantly higher only in patients with asthmatic symptoms, but normal lung function, suggesting a more peripheral inflammation in these patients than in patients with asthma.",

Background: Mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) is effective for preventing and treating nasal symptoms in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Its effects on ocular symptoms have not been investigated. This retrospective analysis examined the effects of MFNS on ocular symptoms in subjects with SAR. Methods: Ocular symptom data were pooled and analyzed from four randomized, double-blind studies comparing MFNS 200 mcg once daily (n = 494) with placebo (n = 497). Subject-reported ocular itching, redness, and tearing were recorded at baseline and twice daily throughout treatment on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Total ocular symptom score (TOSS) was defined as the combined 2-week average symptom scores. Results: MFNS produced a statistically greater reduction in TOSS from baseline as compared to placebo (j1.33 vs. j0.94, p G 0.05). Likewise, mean 2-week reductions in individual symptoms were significantly improved with MFNS (p G 0.05 for each symptom). In subjects with TOSS 4 at baseline, MFNS recipients (n = 298) reported a significantly greater reduction in TOSS as compared to placebo recipients (n = 304; j1.97 vs. j1.51, p G 0.05), with statistically significant benefits also observed in individual ocular symptoms (p G 0.05 for each symptom). Conclusion: MFNS has a beneficial effect on ocular symptoms, in addition to its established effects on nasal symptoms, in subjects with SAR. Background: Royal jelly is a health supplement widely consumed in the community and has perceived benefits ranging including boosting the immune system. However, royal jelly consumption has been linked with contact dermatitis, acute asthma, anaphylaxis and death. Case reports of allergy to royal jelly have been reported among atopics. Our previous study among local allergic patients demonstrated that royal jelly sensitivity was found to be present in this country. Several major allergens in the range of 39 to 71 kD have been detected. Thus, the aim of this study is to identify the major allergens of royal jelly using 2dimensional electrophoresis and mass-spectrometry analysis. Methods: Extract of royal jelly was fractionated by charge and molecular weight using 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-D) . Immunoblotting of the 2-D profiles were performed to identify the allergenic spots of the major allergens using sera from royal jelly allergic patients. Spots were then excised from the 2-D gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and Q-TOF MSMS. For protein identification, the masses obtained were used to search databases to identify the proteins. Results: 2-D gel fractionated the royal jelly proteins to more than 50 different protein spots. Out of these, 31 spots demonstrated specific IgE to the sera tested. Digested peptides of most allergenic spots as compared to the amino acid sequence in databases identified the fragments of royal jelly homologus to major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJ1) and major royal jelly protein 2 (MRJ2). Our results confirmed that the major allergenic spots of royal jelly are MRJ1 and MRJ2.",

Parvalbumins represent the main major allergens and responsible for IgE cross-reactivity between various species of fish. Tongkol belongs to the genus Thunnus that includes several species. Tuna, which is widely consumed worldwide, also belongs to this genus. The aim of this study was to characterize IgE-binding components of Thunnus tonggol (tongkol/ Northern bluefin tuna). Methods: Uncooked and cooked extracts of the fish were prepared from the fish meat. Protein profile and IgE binding pattern was demonstrated by sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting using sera from subjects with fish allergy. The major allergens of the fish were then identified by two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis, followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the peptide digest. Results: The SDS-PAGE of raw extract revealed 26 protein fractions over a wide molecular weight range, while cooked extract demonstrated only nine protein fractions. The 1-D immunoblotting detected 17 IgE-binding proteins, ranging in molecular weight from 151 to~12 kD. Two protein fractions with molecular weight of~51 and 42 kD have been identified as the major allergens of this fish. Both proteins were sensitive to heat. The 2-D gel profile of the raw extract demonstrated about 9100 distinct proteins spots and immunoblotting detected at least 10 different major IgE reactive spots with molecular masses as expected and isoelectric point (pI) values ranging from 4.1 to 6.1. Comparison of the major allergenic spot sequences of the~51 and 42 kD proteins with known protein sequences in databases revealed extensive similarity with fish enolase and triose phosphate isomerase, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that enolase and triose phosphate isomerase are the major allergenic component of this species of fish. Interestingly, our study also detected a heat resistant protein at~12 kD as parvalbumin, which is similar as Sal s 1. However, this protein was only seen as a minor allergen for this fish.",

Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Allergy Dept, Guangzhou, China. Objective: To investigate the level of specific IgE (SIgE) of mite and cockroach in allergy patients' blood serum, and study their correlation. Methods: By ELISA test to examine the mite and cockroach allergen's sIgE from the blood serum of 199 outpatients who were recruited during 2004 Oct to 2005 Oct at Respiratory department and Allergy department. Results: In the mite (dermatophagoides pteronyssinus(d1), dermatophagoides farinae(d2), and Blomia Tropicalis(d201) allergic group, the children showed higher proportion of positive result than the adult group. Some strong positive results were all recorded from children. In the cockroach allergic patients, the positive results were all under the class IV level. For those patients who allergic to both of mite and cockroach, the mite allergen SIgE in blood was significantly higher then that of cockroach allergen (p G 0.01). Conclusion: Mite and cockroach are both important allergens of allergic diseases, from which mite played a dominant role. For those patients who are allergic to both mite and cockroach, they are proved to be more sensitive to mite allergen. Background: American cockroach (CR), Periplaneta americana is an important source of indoor allergens among Thais. Currently, screening and monitoring allergic status of allergic patients are performed by skin prick test using crude CR extract which varies in the allergenic composition from batch-to-batch. Thus, recombinant CR allergens may be a better standardized alternative. Thus, in this study, we produced recombinant tropomyosin (Per a7) which is one of the P. americana major allergens. The protein was tested for its ability to bind to IgE in sera of CR allergic Thai patients. Objectives: To produce recombinant tropomyosin of American cockroach, and to determine the IgE binding ability of the recombinant allergen. Materials and Methods: Sera of patients with CR allergy who gave positive skin prick test to CR extract and sera of non-allergic counterparts were collected. Total RNA was extracted from adult P. americana and first strand cDNA was produced by RT-PCR. Gene encoding tropomyosin was amplified using oligonucleotide primers and the cDNA as a template. The amplified sequences were cloned into a cloning vector and a protein expression vector. The latter was used to transfect an Escherichia coli host. E. coli transformant was grown and production of tropomyosin protein was induced by IPTG. The protein was extracted and purified from the bacterial lysate. Results: Gene encoding American cockroach tropomyosin (450 bp) was amplified and cloned into a cloning vector, i.e. pGEM T and a protein expression vector, i.e. pET 20 b+. Amplified sequence showed 100% homology to the tropomyosin gene sequence in the database. Recombinant tropomyosin was produced and purified from whole cell lysis of an E. coli transformant grown under IPTG induced-condition. The protein (~16 kDa) was found to bind IgE in sera of allergic Thai patients. Conclusion and Clinical Relevant: Recombinant tropomyosin of P. americana was successfully produced in pure form. The protein binds IgE in sera of CR allergic Thai patients. Thus, the protein may be used as a standard reagent for screening and monitoring of the allergic status of patients.",

Methods: Thirty-three patients who presented to our Respiratory or Allergy Clinics between October 2004 and May 2007, and tested positive of Blattella germanica allergen by both skin prick test and SIgE test, were further evaluated for allergens related to Periplaneta americana, moth and house dust mite using fluorescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: In patients who showed concurrent hypersensitivity to all of studied allergens, responses to the cockroaches and moth were weak-positive (below Grade IV), with significantly lower SIgE levels than as found for house dust mite (P G 0.001). Linear regression showed positive correlations in allergenicity between the two species of cockroaches and moth (P G 0.001), but not between house dust mite and moth or cockroaches. Conclusion: High response to house dust mite was demonstrated in patients with multiple allergies. Allergens from Blattella germanica, Periplaneta americana and moth appeared to share some IgE binding site in common.",

Institute for Medical Research, Allergy and Immunology Research Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Background: Crab has been recognized as a source of potent allergens especially in countries where seafood forms a large portion of the diet of the community. Blue/ swimming crab (Portunus pelagicus) and red crab (Charybdis japonica) from Family Portunidae are among the most commonly consumed crab in Malaysia. The objective of this study is to characterize the IgE-binding proteins and major allergens of these species of crab. Methods: Cooked and uncooked extracts of both crab were prepared and fractionated by sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). IgE-binding proteins were then demonstrated by immunoblotting tests using sera from 99 and 76 patients with positive skin prick test (SPT) to blue and red crab extracts, respectively. Results: Both species of crab had similar protein profiles. The uncooked extracts of both crab produced 19 protein bands in the range of 15 to 138 kD. Several protein bands between 17 to 25 kD and 50 to 71 kD which were present in the uncooked extracts appeared to be denatured in the cooked extracts. The immunoblotting of blue and red crab revealed 14 and 15 various IgE-binding proteins, in the range of 24 to 138 kD, respectively. The most common IgE-binding proteins were identified in the range of 34 to 46 kD. A 34 kD protein was identified as a major allergen for both crab. A 36 kD protein was also demonstrated as a major allergen in red crab and two proteins at 38 and 46 kD were also seen as major allergens in blue crab. Interestingly, these major allergens at 34, 36 and 38 kD were similar in size with tropomyosin, the main major allergen and responsible in the majority of allergic reactions to various seafood species including crab.",

Institute for Medical Research, Allergy and Immunology Research Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Background: Nut allergy (peanut and tree nut) is a common cause of allergy and can even cause severe anaphylactic reactions. Peanut allergy is more common than tree nut allergy, but many subjects develop hypersensitivity to both peanuts and tree nuts. Peanuts are known as ground nuts, earth nuts and monkey nuts while tree nuts refer to nuts such as Brazil nut, hazel nut, almond, walnuts and cashew nuts. The peanut plant, Arachis hypogaea, belongs to the botanical family Leguminose and do not related botanically to nuts such as Brazil nut, hazel nut or almond. There are no reports of prevalence of peanut and tree nuts allergy in Malaysia neither is there reports of fatal anaphylaxis due to nut allergy. Methods: A total of 621 children and adults with history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, hives and food allergy) were skin tested to a panel of peanuts and tree nuts (commercial and in-house extracts). Results: We found that children have higher skin test positivity to peanuts and tree nuts compared to adults. In children, skin prick test showed 8.5% positivity to raw peanut and walnut, 6% to big peanut and 4.3% to almond, and cashew nuts extracts whilst skin prick test positivity to both hazel nuts and walnut were lower at 2.6% and 1.7% respectively. In adults, the most common skin test reactivities are peanuts, 5% and 4% to cashew nuts.",

Purpose of the Study: Comparison of two in vitro assays for the detection of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) and Total IgE (TigE) (Dr. Fooke ALLERG-O-LIQ, Neuss, Germany, www.fooke-labs.de; Pharmacia CAP-System, Upsala, Sweden, www.pharmacia.com) re-analyzing sera with sIgE to common inhalatans and food allergens and TIgE. Materials and Methods: Allergens: Inhalants: housedust mite D. pter. d1, D.farinae d2, Blomia tropicalis d5, Cat (Epithelia) e1, Dog (Epithelia) e5, German Cockroach i6, Aspergillus fumigatus m3; food allergens (FA): hen's egg f1, cow's milk f2, Crab f23, shrimp f24. Patients Sera: Sera from allergic patients (bronchus asthma, allergic rhinitis and chronic cough) were collected from Oct. 2004 to May. 2007 at Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory disease out patient department. Clinical data were not evaluated. Performance: sIgE was measured in single runs according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. Assay features and methodological differences are listed in table 1. Calculation: Associations between quantitative sIgE-levels of different assays were calculated using non-parametric Spearman-Ranktest and depicted with log scales. Sensitivity, Specificity and Agreement per allergen was calculated, using following formula: 1) Sensitivity (%) = (# of LIQ+ results)/(# of CAP+ result per allergen) 2) Specificity (%) = (# of LIQ-results)/(# of CAP-result per allergen). Background: Autism is a neuropsychiatric condition that presents with abnormal, bizarre behaviour patterns and accompanied by learning difficulties. Peptides known as casamorphin (from milk proteins) and gliadinomorphin (from gluten protein) are absorbed from the gut into the blood stream leading to the theory of Bleaky gut syndrome[. Methods: Eighty-four autism children, divided into 2 groups: younger age (less than 5 years) and an older age group (5 to 19 years) were skin prick tested (SPT) to a panel of food allergens. Blood test for specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) to cow's milk, wheat, soya and oat, specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin A (IgA) to alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, casein and gliadin were carried out. Questionnaires on behavioural pattern of children were filled by parents. Results: The majority of autism children were Chinese (76.2%) and male (88%). In the younger group, we found that SPT to soya 8.3%, wheat 3.5%, and cow's milk 2.3%. Specific IgE to cow's milk 9.52%, wheat 2.3%, and soya 1.2%. 8.3% had detectable levels to IgG alpha-lactalbumin, 5.9% to IgG beta-lactoglobulin, 1.2% to IgA beta-lactoglobulin and 4.76% to IgG casein. No IgA alpha-lactalbumin, IgG casein, IgG gliadin, IgA casein and IgA gliadin were detected in this group of children. In the older children, 23% has positive SPT to wheat, 17.8% to soya, and 9.5% to cow's milk. Specific IgE to cow's milk and wheat was 9.52% whereas to soya 8.3%. 11.9% had detectable IgG alpha-lactalbumin, 7.1% to IgG beta-lactoglobulin, 3.5% to IgG gliadin while 2.3% had detectable levels of IgG casein, IgA alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, gliadin and 1.2% to IgA casein. As to behavioural pattern, the study showed that 70.6% of younger group and 64.2% of older group presented with unawareness of the world, 88.4% in younger group has poor eye contact compared to 61.2% in older group.

The optimal number and type of allergens used in different settings remains undefined. We aim to describe SPT in our clinical practice and propose the appropriateness of reducing the number of pollen allergens to three. The aim is to improve cost-effectiveness and reducing time spent on allergen testing, particularly in the community setting. Methods: Consecutive patients who attended the private rooms of 2 immunologists and the allergy/immunology clinic in a tertiary referral hospital who required skin prick testing were evaluated from June 2006 to November 2006. Statistical analysis was undertaken with the use of Pearson`s Chi-square and Fisher`s Exact test to assess for significance. Multivariate analysis was also performed. Results: There were a total of 273 skin prick test sets performed. There was no significant difference between the rates of SPT positivity with common pollen allergens between the two clinics. A positive SPT to Perennial Ryegass (Lolium perenne), Timothy (Phleum patense) or Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) had a sensitivity of 100% to Bent or Orchard grass (Dactylis glomerate), with sensitivities of 97%, 96.3% and 94.8% to English Plantain (Plantago lanceolata), Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum)and Dock/Sorrel (Rumex sp) respectively. Use of Perennial Ryegrass, Timothy or Bermuda grass also detected tree pollen sensitivity with sensitivities in Birch mix (Betula sp) of 92.6%, Acacia (96.4%), Casuarina (89.1%), Platanus sp (92.3%) and Privet(Ligustrum sp) (88.6%). Conclusion: The use of 3 common grass pollen allergens in SPTs (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense and Cynodon dactylon) detected 90% of atopic individuals with sensitivity to many pollen types.

Atopy patch tests (APT) represent a useful tool for detection of such hypersensitivity. Methods: We examined hypersensitivity to common aero-allergens (birch pollen, grass pollen, cat dander, house-dust mites) using APT, skin prick-tests (SPT) and specific IgE in 27 children suffering from atopic eczema. Results of all methods were then compared. Results: Delayed-type hypersensitivity was found out (using APT) in 16 patients (59%), immediate type of hypersensitivity was found out (using SPT ) in 13 patients (48%), using specific IgE in 15 patients (55%). Only immediate type of hypersensitivity was proved in 5 patients (18%), only delayed-type hypersensitivity in 6 patients (22%). Both types of hypersensitivity occurred concomitantly in 11 patients (41%). In 32 cases the type of hypersensitivity differed in the same allergen. A significant (pG 0.0005) positive correlation was found between SPT and specific IgE. Correlation of clinical symptoms of AE and positivity of tests was in 7 patients (26%) in IgE mediated hypersensitivity and in 10 patients (37%) in delayed-type hypersensitivity. Conclusion: Various aero-allergens can influence substantially the course of atopic eczema not only via specific IgE, but as well by specific T cell-mediated reactions. Therefore testing for hypersensitivity to aero-allergens both using SPT and/or specific IgE, and atopy patch tests could be useful.",

Methods: 131 patients with positive case history and SPT to grass pollen, house dust mite, moulds, bee and wasp venom suffering of bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis /hay fever and 10 clinically health controls were studied. The in vitro quantity of serum allergen-specific IgE (UniCap, Pharmacia) and the percentage of allergen-specific basophil's degranulation (FasImmune, BD) were evaluated. The correlation and the percent of coincidence of the results from the three methods were analysed (Statistica 5.5). Results: Significant statistical correlation between the resuls from the three methods in patients sensitized to grass pollen and house dust mite were found. Strong positive correlation (Spearman, pG0.05) between the SPT and the quantity of specific IgE-R=0.67 and R=0.61, between the in vivo test and FasImmune -R=0.66 and R=0.62 and between the both in vitro methods -R=0.67 and R=0.53 were determined. Data from patients, allergic to insect's venom, showed a high percent of coincidence between the three methods -from 70% to 90%. Respectively a cincidence of 60% between the SPT and the quantity of specific IgE in the group sensitized to moulds was established. Conclusion: The results from the invitro methods represent positive correlation and coincidence with SPT, especially for the allergens of grass pollen, house dust mite, bee and wasp venom. Their application ensures more preceise diagnosis of patients and contributes to the complex assessment of IgE mediated allergy.",

            "text": "Background: Allergic disease have a significant impact on clinical practice due to their high prevalence. The total IgE quantification is one of the important steps in the classic atopic disease diagnostics.The most widely used methods for IgE detection are time-consuming and complex. Biosensors are interesting tools offering certain operational advantages over standard photometric methods, notably with respect to rapidity, ease-of-use, cost, simplicity, portability, and ease of mass manufacture. Methods: QCM work as sensors based on the relationship between frequency change and mass loading on the surface of the crystal according to Sauerbrey equation (Sauerbrey, J Phys, 1959) . When antigens react with coated antibodies on the surface, a frequency shift occurs and this change is proportional to the mass loading. Results: The monoclonal anti-IgE were successful immobilize in Nafion polymeric matrix on silver electrodes of piezoelectric quartz resonator. The optimal conditions for anti-IgE immobilization procedure and for piezoelectric immunoassay have been determined. Only 10 microlitres of serum and 45 minutes reaction time is required to measure total IgE. It was found that biosensor is capable to differentiate blood serums of patients with low, intermediate and high level of IgE. Conclusion: The quartz crystal microbalance immunosensor offers a number of significant advantages over the currentlu available in vitro techniques for the detection of total IgE. It is supposed that such biosensor can be used in laboratory practice for IgE determination. Background: The purpose of this study is to determine over 12 months, 2/1/ 06Y1/31/07, the rate of SRs to both P and ID ST, the symptoms reported, and the response to immediate treatment with epinephrine IM. Methods: A retrospective review over a one year period was conducted to evaluate SRs to P and ID ST to 20 to 50 allergens (trees, grasses, weeds, animals, molds, foods, medications, and Hymenoptera) in 1,456 subjects. A standard form was used to record symptoms, signs, and treatment. No vasovagal reactions were included. Nurses as instructed by the attending physicians administered epinephrine 1:1000 v/v, 0.2mL IM as soon as any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis occurred. Results: 52 patients (3.5%) had SRs, 43 (83%) female and 9 (17%) male. The average age of the patients with SRs was 40.6 years (range 13Y70, median 35.5 years). 17/52 (33%) had asthma. Symptoms reported: pruritic eyes, nose, and/ or pharynx (40%), worsening cough (27%), sensation of difficulty swallowing (17%), worsening nasal congestion (15%), rhinorrhea (13%), chest tightness and/or shortness of breath (13%), generalized pruritus (12%), sneezing (12%), urticaria (4%) , and wheeze (4%) . No severe asthma, shock, hypotension, unconsciousness, or late phase responses occurred. Treatment: 52 (100%) patients received epinephrine (average dose, 0.2 cc, 1:1000 IM), 48 (92%) oral prednisone, 9 (17%) oral prednisone to take 6 to 8 hours after reaction, 50 (96%) oral antihistamine (H1) , and 6 (12%) nebulized beta agonist. Conclusion: SRs occurred in 3.5% of patients skin tested and readily responded to early intervention with epinephrine. This early administration of epinephrine by nurses appears to prevent more serious and late phase reactions.",

CC16 as the marker of bronchiolar epithelium was assessed by latex immunoassay. In the lung, histological examinations were done and the activity of glutathione S-transferases (GST) was determined. Additionaly total and differential cell number (lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages) were measured. Results: Benzalkonium exposure after challenge induced statistically significant increases of BALF cytokines, LDH and IgE in BALF and serum. CC16 level in BALF was significantly reduced. Significant negative correlation of CC16 concentration in BALF with mediators (IL-6) of inflammatory processes was seen. Huge increase of LDH correlated with the level of total protein, MIP-2 and IgE in serum. Negative relationship was shown to occur between CC16 and LDH. IgE in serum and BALF correlated with MMP-9. In histopathology examination, focal agglomerations of alveolar macrophages were noted as well as proliferation of peribronchial lymphatic tissue. Conclusion: CC16 play a protective role in allergic inflammation and take part in remodelling effects of low molecular weight sensitizers. CC16 can be used as a diagnostic marker for early detection of impaired respiratory function.",

Background: Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is a quaternary ammonium compound in which the alkyl groups have a chain length from C8 to C18. BAC exerts toxic effects on microorganisms. This property has been utilized in the cosmetic industry and medicine, where it is used as an effective germicide and preservative agent. Various BAC-containing preparations used by people may produce a number of adverse effects on the human body. Bearing in mind that BAC is widely used in different branches of the national economy, its toxic effect may constitute a major health problem. Materials and Methods: Female Wistar rats IMP: WIST of body weight 165Y185 g were exposed to BAC aerosol at the target concentration of 30 mg/m3 in the dynamic inhalation chamber for 6 h and 3 days (6 h/ day). After the exposure and 18 h after termination of exposure to BAC aerosol, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from each animal and BALF concentrations of total protein, Clara cell protein, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) hyalurnic acid (HA), immunoglobulin E (IgE) and cytokines (TNF-\", IL-6 and MIP-20) and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and GSH-S-transferase (GST) were determined. Results: All the rats survived inhalation exposure to 30 mg/m3 BAC. A significant reduction of body weight was noted in the animals exposed repeatedly by inhalation to BAC. Lung weight, total protein, HA level and LDH activity in BALF were higher in rats after single and repeated exposure to BAC, compared to control. Decreased concentrations of CC16 in BALF of rats were observed after the single and repeated inhalation exposure. A significantly higher level of IL-6 and IgE were noted in the BALF from the animals exposed to the single and repeated dose. Concentrations of MMP-9, TNF-\", and MIP-2 in BALF of rats exposed to BAC were similar to those found in the control animals. Conclusion: BAC showed a strong inflammatory and irritating activity in the lungs of the rats already after 6 hours of inhalation exposure. BAC stimulates the dynamic patterns of IL-6 and IgE production and infiltration of protein from blood circulation system to BALF. Continued exposure resulted in changes involving cellular destruction, statistically increase of LDH activity and a continuous reduction of CC16 concentration in BALF.",

Early diagnosis is essential as this disease is responsive to corticosteroids. However, there is still no consensus about the diagnostic criteria, because patients in different stages of ABPA may not fulfill the criteria. In this study, we evaluate the prevalence of ABPA or ABPA-like disease in an asthma clinic using essential minimal diagnostic criteria. Methods: A prospective evaluation of patients with bronchial asthma for ABPA from July 2006 onward. ABPA was diagnosed using essential minimal criteria ?asthma, skin prick testing (SPT) positivity to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af), elevated serum total IgE (CAP), elevated serum Af-specific IgE (CAP), and central bronchiectasis on CT scans. Results: Ninety consecutive patients with bronchial asthma were enrolled. Forty-four of 90 patients were atopic (49.0%), 7 of 44 (18.0%) were positive to SPT to Af. Five of 44 patients (11.0%) showed only elevated serum Af-specific IgE without positive response to Af on SPT. A secure diagnosis of ABPA, satisfying all essential minimal criteria, was evident in 4 of 12 patients (33.3%). Conclusion: There is high prevalence of ABPA in asthmatic patients presenting our hospital. Further evaluations are required to differentiate ABPA from asthma patients sensitizing to Af without ABPA. The role of serum Af-specific IgE as a screening tool in diagnosis of ABPA should be redefined.",

Objective: To evaluate the utility of searching clinical information with Google in order to obtain a correct diagnosis of complex immunological and allergic (CIA) case reports. Study Design: Comparative cross-sectional study. Methods: Firty-five CIA case reports were randomly selected by an independent investigator from peer-viewed medical journals. Clinical data was presented separately to three observers blinded to final diagnosis. Observer A is a Consultant in Internal medicine and Allergy with an expert knowledge of these fields and basic computing skills. Observer B is a Registrar in Internal medicine and Allergy. Observer C is a research nurse. Both observers B and C had a more familiar knowledge of the regular use of computer search engines. An internet-based search using Google was conducted. In order to perform this, the observers individually studied each text and independently selected five search terms, of their own choosing, from each case record to enter into the standard Google search engine. The observers then recorded for each case the single most prominent diagnosis that was evident from within the first three results pages of the conducted Google search. Since Google does not necessarily include diagnoses within the search results page itself, observers were permitted to select the diagnosis that best fitted the case record from information after opening each direct results link only. The independent investigator then compared the diagnoses obtained by each observer with the definitive diagnoses as published in the Journals. The main outcome measure of this study was the percentage of correctly obtained diagnoses achieved by each observer. Results: Observer A identified the definitive diagnosis in 30/45 cases (66%, 95%CI 52Y79). Observer B in 39/45 (86%, 95%CI 76Y95) and Observer C in 29/45 (64%, 95%CI 50Y77). Most diagnostic inaccuracies for both observers were those related to primary immunodeficiency or pediatric cases. Conclusion: This Google-based search was useful to achieve an appropriate diagnosis in CIA cases. Computer and Internet-based search skills could influence the results.",

According to a report by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products on toxicity studies (Feb 1999), humic acids extracted from brown coal has no toxic effects on rats in a chronic study at oral dosages as high as 1g/kg BW, whereas the LD50 in rats, after oral administration of humic acids, has been reported to be greater than 11g/kg BW. This report has recently been confirmed by a separate study.",

Methods: In this parallel double-blind placebo controlled phase II study potassium humate was randomly assigned, at a dosage of 1.8g in divided doses/day, to atopic patients (n = 40) presenting with acute symptoms of hay fever. The blood and nasal samples were used to determine the safety and the effects of potassium humate on basophil activation, cytokine levels and eosinophil migration. A skin prick test was used to determine its anti-allergic effects. An in vitro neutrophil adhesion test was used to determine the effects of the product on the adhesion of human neutrophils to ICAM-1expressing baby hamster kidney cells. Results: A significant decrease in the skin prick test results (presented elsewhere) and eosinophil counts was observed. No significant differences were observed with regard to neutrophil adhesion nor were there any differences observed with regard to the stimulation of basophils. However decreases were observed in the expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-8 and IL-1\u00e2 after treatment, although not reaching statistical significance. The product had no effect on neutrophil adhesion to ICAM-1. Conclusion: This study confirmed, without doubt, that this product possesses anti-inflammatory as well as anti-allergic properties possibly due to a decreased recruitment of eosinopils to the site of inflammation.",

            "text": "Background: Intractable skin ulcer is common in our daily practice. Although patients' QOL is severely impaired by this skin lesion, until now effective treatment protocols have not been established. Wound healing process can be separated into inflammatory phase, proliferating phase, and remodeling phase. Recent reviews have described that prolonged inflammatory phase might partly affect the pathogenic mechanisms of intractable skin ulcer. During the inflammatory phase, various kinds of inflammatory cell infiltrates ware observed in the affected area, and recruited macrophages secrete some inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and VEGF. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)treatment is believed to be one of the promising treatment for skin ulcers, and LipoPGE1 also demonstrated improvement in a drug delivery system. To note, it has been reported that infiltrated macrophages uptake LipoPGE1. Taken these results together, we hypothesized that LipoPGE1 might have an antiinflammatory effect and thus contribute to the improvement of intractable skin ulcer. Methods: Patients with various kinds of intractable skin ulcers were administered with intra-venous injection of 10 microgram/day LipoPGE1 (Palxus\\) for two weeks, and the size of the ulcer area and serum concentration of CRP, IL-6, VEGF, and sICAM1 were measured before and after treatment. Results: LipoPGE1 effectively reduced the size of the ulcer area and the serum inflammatory markers after two weeks of LipoPGE1-treatment. Conclusion: These results indicated that anti-inflammatory effect of LipoPGE1 might contribute to the improvement of the intractable skin ulcers.",

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study Background: Evaluation of weal reaction and laser Doppler flowmetry are valuable methods for evaluation of efficacy of different pharmacological agents. The aim of our study was to compare the influence of different H1-antihistamines on histamine induced weal reaction, increase of skin blood perfusion and sedation. Methods: Histamine prick test induced weal area in mm2, percentage of blood perfusion change and area under curve during peak perfusion period (AUCmax) was measured with Periflux System 4000 (Perimed AB, Sweden) 2 hours after intake of 5 mg levocetirizine, 5 mg desloratadine, 1 mg clemastine, 50 mg kvifenadine, 50 mg sekvifenadine and placebo. Sedative effect was measured in mm by visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: Results were expressed as mean T 95%CI. Mean weal reaction area was 6.9 (j3.9;+10.7); 17.5 (j12.6;+23.1); 20.2 (j14.9;+26.2); 18.1 (j13.1;+23.9); 17.8 (j12.8;+23.5) and 29.0 (j22.6;+36.1) mm2 respectively. Statistically significant difference was observed between active treatment and placebo (pG0.05), and levocetirizine and other H1-antihistamines (pG0.001). Increase of blood perfusion was 393.1% (j221.3;+613.8); 626.2% (j403.0;+898.3); 756.5% (j508.8;+1053.2); 741.0% (j496.2; +1339.1); 1001.5% (j712.8;+1339.1) and 1033.2% (j739.6;+1375.8) respectively. Significant decrease of augmentation of blood perfusion was observed after pre-treatment with levocetirizine and desloratadine vs. placebo (pG0.05) and levocetirizine vs. kvifenadine, sekvifenadine and clemastine (pG0.05). AUCmax was 1298.7 (j781.2;+1947.0); 2197.3 (j1504.5; +3020.9); 2454.3 (j1718.3;+3321.0); 2633.2 (j1868.6;+3528.6); 2551.7 (j1800.0;+3434.2) and 3166.2 (j2321.4;+4141.7) U*s. AUCmax was significantly lower after pre-treatment with levocetirizine vs. placebo and other antihistamines (pG0.05). Sedative effect was 24.5 (j17.9;+32.1); 21.1 (j15.1;+28.1); 28.2 (j21.2;+36.2); 17.6 (j12.0;+24.1); 15.1 (j10.0;+21.0) and 19.9 (j14.1;+26.7) mm of VAS. Significant difference of sedation we observed between levocetirizine vs. sekvifenadine, clemastine vs. kvifenadine, sekvifenadine and placebo (pG0.05). Conclusion: Levocetirizine induced significant decrease of weal and flare reaction and skin blood perfusion compared to placebo and other H1antihistamines. Influence of kvifenadine and sekvifenadine on weal reaction area was similar to desloratadine and clemastine. Sedative effect of clemastine was more pronounced than kvifenadine and sekvifenadine.",

            "text": "Characterising the pharmacological properties of fluticasone furoate, a novel enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid Methods: Binding affinity of FF for the human lung glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was determined by elucidation of association and dissociation rate constants. Molecular interactions of FF with the GR were identified by X-ray crystallography of the GR ligand-binding domain. Cellular onset of action was determined by measuring nuclear translocation in human lung epithelial cells. Measurement of human progesterone (PR), mineralocorticoid (MR), androgen (AR), and oestrogen receptor (ER) activities was used to assess the steroid hormone selectivity of FF. Cellular protection of FF to elastase or mechanical wounding was determined in 16HBe human lung epithelial cells and antiinflammatory effects of FF in the lung were determined using the Brown Norway Ovalbumin Rat model. Results: FF has very fast association with, and slow dissociation from, the GR, with a relative receptor affinity (RRA) of 2988T135 with reference to dexamethasone (RRA: 100T5), higher than all other currently available clinical glucocorticoids: mometasone furoate (MF) 2244T142, fluticasone propionate (FP) 1775T130, beclomethasone-17-monopropionate 1345T125, ciclesonide active principle 1212, and budesonide 855. FF has hydrogen bond interactions with the GR through the 3-keto (with Gln570 and Arg611) and the 11$-hydroxy (with Asn564) groups; the 17 $-fluoromethylthioester group also forms a favourable electrostatic interaction with Asn564. FF induces a rapid translocation of GR into the nucleus (G20 minutes to maximum effect) and has high selectivity for GR (30-, 790-, 9330,000-and 9330,000-fold) versus PR, MR, AR and ER, respectively. FF confers substantial protection against elastase-and mechanically induced damage, with more potent protection than budesonide, FP and MF. FF completely prevents lung eosinophilia, an effect greater than that with FP. Conclusion: FF has enhanced affinity for the GR compared with other available glucocorticoids, which translates into more potent protection against cellular damage and lung inflammation. Coupled with its fast cellular onset of action and high selectivity for the GR, these properties may contribute to a favourable clinical efficacy and safety profile for FF.",

            "text": "Cetirizine is an antihistamic drug of the second generation. Besides its anti-histamic activity various actions have been reported in this antihistamic. In epidermal keratinocytes, cetirizine inhibits the expression of costimulatory molecule ICAM-1 and the MHC class II molecule HLA-DR. Moreover, it exerts anti-inflammation actions by suppressing the production of cytokines and chemokines in various immunocompetent cells. Levocetirizine (L-cetirizine) is the optical isomer of cetirizine and widely used for the treatment of allergic disorders in European countries. In this study, we investigated whether there are differences between cetirizine and levocetirizine in the cytokine and chemokine production by normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK).While NHEK were stimulated with interferon-,(IFN-,) and tumor necrosis factor-\" (TNF-\") cetirizine or levocetirizine was added to the experimental cultures. Three day-culture supernatants were measured for the concentrations of IL-1\", IL-8, RANTES, Mig, I-TAC and MDC. The IFN-,/TNF-\"-augmented levels of IL-1\", IL-8 and I-TACK were significantly suppressed by the addition of either cetirizine or levocetirizine to the culture in dose-dependent manners (10 j9 Y 10 j7 M). RANTES, Mig or MDC was not suppressed by cetirizine. To examine the effects of these two reagents on the expression of CD54 (ICAM-1) molecules, NHEK were incubated with IFN-, with or without cetirizine or levocetirizine for 48 hrs. Cetirizine and levocetirizine at 10 j8 M downmodulated the expression of CD54 molecules at similar levels to each other.This study demonstrates that cetirizine and levocetirizine have comparable effects on the immunological function of keratinocytes. It is noted that levocetirizine has slightly but significantly stronger effects than cetirizine in the production of RANTES and Mig.",

Methods: This was a single-center, randomised, open-label study comparing CT vs. OnD treatment of PER patients with levocetirizine 5mg, once daily, over 6 months. Patients were allowed to have mild asthma treated with a shortacting beta-agonist. Sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal and ocular pruritus (T4SS=sum of these 4 symptoms) and nasal congestion were measured daily on a 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) scale. Rhinasthma questionnaire (RQ) was used to assess subjects`quality of life (range 0Y100; 30 item questionnaire: 1=not bothered at all, 5=bothered very much). Quality of sleep was reported on a VAS scale (0=worst; 10=best). Results: 31 patients were enrolled per group; 18 in the OnD and 22 in the CT group completed the study. No patients discontinued for drug-related serious adverse events (AEs). Improvement from baseline in T4SS was significantly higher in favour of CT during months 5 (pG0.01) and 6 (pG0.03). The maximal T4SS improvement was 80% for OnD and 87% for CT. The maximal improvement in nasal congestion was 75% for OnD and 85% for CT. Quality of sleep considerably improved at end of study: from baseline VAS=5.77 (OnD) and VAS=5.63 (CT) to VAS=7.82 (OnD) and VAS=7.25 (CT). No serious (AEs) were observed. 3.3% of subjects in the CT and 9.4% in the OnD groups reported drug-related treatment-emergent AEs. Conclusion: Our study confirms previous data that, when taking a potent antihistamine, like levocetirizine, PER symptoms (including nasal congestion) are effectively controlled over a 6-month treatment period. In addition, most of the individual symptoms were controlled significantly better when treated continuously. Regardless of the regimen, levocetirizine improved the patientsq uality of life and sleep, and was very well tolerated with fewer patients reporting AEs in the CT group. Our results support the long-term continuous treatment of PER with a potent and well-tolerated antihistamine.",

Oxatomide (OXM), an antihistaminic drug, has been shown to be clinically effective for the treatment of hypersensitivity and childhood asthma. Its mode of action has been elucidated to increase IFN-g activity as well as anti-histaminic reaction. Objective and Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 41 patients with atopic dermatitis allergic to hen-egg ranging from 2 months to 2 years 10 months in age. The patients had recurrent eczema, pruritus and positive skin reactions to egg white and/or cow`s milk. Patients also had positive responses to the oral provocation test to raw hen egg and or cow`s milk. Diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis was based on the criteria of Hanifin and Rajk. To clarify the mode of action whereby OXM ameliorates the conditions of the children with food allergy-complicated atopic dermatitis and whether development of bronchial asthma is prevented, OXM-related alterations of the clinical symptoms and examination, seen in patients during the course of 8 months`to 6 years and 10 months`treatment was evaluated. Results and Discussion: Scores for itching, sleep disturbance and skin lesions (inflammation, lichenification, cracking) was improved from 10 to 2.7 (mean) during the course of 8-16 weeks' treatment with 2mg/kg of OXM in addition to elimination diets, treatment of skin care (shower, Isodine[R], non-steroid ointment), administration of hydroxyzine and/or oral sodium cromoglicate. In further study, OXM efficiently suppressed incidence of asthma to approximately 9% of the patients (control:42.9%) and both of total IgE value and peripheral eosinophils count was not elevated after OXM-treatment and were lower than those in age-matched asthma patients un-treated with OXM. Conclusion: OXM, which is a significant candidate for one of the therapeutic modalities against children with food allergy-induced atopic dermatitis, and based on the clinical study, was also found to be effective prophylaxis for development of childhood asthma.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of primary and secondary low-grade rhinovirus infections on allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of allergic asthma. Methods: A low-grade rhinovirus (2 x 10 (3) plaque-forming units/mouse) was inoculated, and this caused neither pulmonary inflammation nor symptoms but induced significant IFN-gamma production in thoracic lymph nodes. To investigate interaction between low-grade virus and Dermatophagoides farinae (Df), airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation and cytokine production from thoracic lymph nodes were compared after primary and secondary low-grade rhinovirus infections in four groups of mice; control, Df allergen-sensitized, rhinovirus-infected and Df-sensitized rhinovirusinfected mice. A direct comparison between low-and high-grade rhinovirus infections was also performed in primary infection. To investigate the role of IL-5 during secondary rhinovirus infection, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-5 mAb) was injected in mice and similar parameters were compared in four groups of mice.",

Anti-IL-5 mAb treatment in secondary low-grade rhinovirus infection and Df allergensensitized mice attenuated virus and allergen-induced airway inflammation. Conclusion: Low-grade rhinovirus infection per se does not cause pulmonary inflammation, whereas it induces a significant immunological response in the allergen-sensitized host. These results indicate that subclinical and recurrent rhinovirus infection may play an important role in exacerbation and maintenance of asthma in adults, wherein IL-5 is critically involved.",

Skin prick tests with common aero-allergens and latex, spirometry and bronchodilatation test were performed. Total IgE, complement study, proteins electrophoresis, immunoglobulins determination, cellular immunity study, HIV, X-ray study and thoracic CT-scan, mantoux, zielh and sputum culture were done. Results: Positive skin prick test for pollens and dog and cat epithelia were obtained. The patient had normal spirometry values and a negative bronchodilatation test. All the laboratory tests were in normal levels. Determination of total IgE was 483 KU/l. The chest X-ray showed cavities in both lungs with interstitial infiltrates. The CT-scan confirmed these findings. Mantoux, Zielh with 50 BAAR/field and MAV culture were positive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was excluded by CRP. Cellular immunity, complement, proteins electrophoresis and immunoglobulins determination were in normal range. HIV test was negative. Conclusion: We present the case of a patient with rhinoconjuntivitis due to pollens hypersensitivity and persistent cough with pulmonary infection for Mycobacteium Avium associated. The Mycobacterium Avium was not described as human pathogen until 1950, when many series described pulmonary infections for MAV. This mycobacterium mainly attacks immunosuppressed patients. This infection is less frequent in patients with normal immunity. Our patient did not have immunosuppression nor risk factors. At the present time she is being treated with antibiotics (ethambutol and claritromicin) and she is in good general condition with no need of hospitalisations. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited phagocytic disorder caused by mutations in NADPH oxidase subunits. Patients with CGD have life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. Childrens Medical Center at Tehran University is the referral center for immunodeficiency in Iran. During two years of study forty five families with clinically diagnosed CGD were referred to this center. Neutrophil functional assays performed for affected children and their mothers; no activity or residual activity was detected in affected neutrophils. PMN (Poly Morpho Nuclear) oxidative burst revealed mosaic pattern in 12 mothers. Western blot analysis revealed gp91phenotype in all their sons. Mutation screening in CYBB gene using SSCP analysis followed by sequencing, showed 9 different mutations including one novel mutation. Western immunoblot subtyping of patients whose mother showed no mosaic pattern by DHR123 revealed 24 patients with p47 null expression, 7 and 2 patients with p22 and p67 defect, respectively. %GT screening in Ncf1 gene for p47-patients, revealed 8 patients with this mutation. Mutation analysis for the rest of Ncf1 gene for these patients is understudy. CYBA mutation analysis revealed 6 different mutations including three novel mutations in p22-patients. Overall, the number of autosomal recessive patients with CGD in Iran is high and it seems consanguineous marriages is one of its causative factors. All appropriate papers and information were presented to volunteers. Motivation, understanding of vaccine properties and trial procedure, risk behavior, ability to perform the trial protocol were estimated. Volunteers enrolled in trials after confidential medical investigation and informed consent undersigning. Results: 65 persons of 298 enquiries were screened as potential volunteers. The main reasons for participation: help to HIV-infected people (65%) including persons in nearest surround (wife, husband, friend, child) (41%); contribution in development of HIV/AIDS vaccine (35%); possibility of immune protection against HIV (18%), free insurance and/or medical care (4%) . 20% (13 of 65) of persons refused to participate in trials. Reasons of refusal: doubts in vaccine safety and fear to receive HIV-infection (61%), fear of side effects (30%), fear of vaccine-induced HIV seropositivity (15%), impossibility to perform the trial protocol (7%), low compensation (2%), unexplained (15%). 30 persons not refused to participate in clinical trials, but decided to do it in future (clinical trials phase II). Reasons: planned pregnancy or temporal impossibility to perform the trial protocol. 17 volunteers (14 men, 1 woman, age 22Y31) were enrolled in trials. 2 of them leaved trials after 1st vaccination (unexplained reason), 9 successfully passed the trials protocol and 6 are at final step of trials.

The most common form, X-linked CGD (X-CGD) resulted from the mutation of CYBB gene on chromosome Xp21.1. We evaluated a Thai boy who had multiple Salmonella septicemia, Aspergillus pneumonia and brain abscess. His nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was reportedly abnormal. The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry assay was performed and the fluorescence pattern upon stimulation was compatible with typical X-CGD. CYBB analysis revealed a novel complex mutation atggacgY ttca in exon 12 (base pairs 1532Y1538). As a result, 3 amino acids Tyr 511, Gly 512 and Arg 513 were deleted and replaced by 2 amino acids, Phe and Gln. The DHR and mutation analysis of his mother showed normal DHR pattern and no mutations in exon 12 of CYBB gene. Over 300 CYBB mutations have been registered in an internationally maintained X-CGD database. Most mutations are distributed throughout the 13 exons or at exon/intron boundaries, and almost 200 of these mutations are unique. We reported a novel mutation within exon 12 of CYBB gene which was on the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-binding domain in a CGD patient. Functional defect was demonstrated by almost absence of fluorescence upon stimulation of granulocytes on DHR histogram. This defect leads to a severe form of X-CGD. Background: Nutrition is an important factor that influences immunity, and nutritional deficiency can impair resistance to infections.Malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency worldwide. Trace elements such as zinc, selenium, iron, and copper can influence several components of immunity. Primmary antibody deficiency disorders are a group of disorders characterized by an unusual susceptibility to infections and malnutrition. Impaired nutritional status has been reported in immunodeficient patients. The aim of this study was to determine anthropometric indices and trace elements status in these patients. Methods: Thirty-eight children (28 males, 10 females, aged 2Y18 years) with primary antibody deficiency referring to Children,s Medical Center of Tehran University of Medical Science were enrolled in this research. Primary immunodeficiency disorders consisting of CVID, XLA, IgA deficiency, IgG subclass deficiency, and hyper IgM were assessed. Anthropometric indices, comprised of height, weight that were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ) and weightfor-age (WAZ) were determined according to Z-score to study mild, moderate and severe malnutrition. Serum copper, zinc, selenium and iron levels were measured by an atomic absorption spectrometer. Results: The most common disorders were CVID 52.5% and X-linked agammaglobulinemia 27.5%. Based on BMI measuredment 21.1% of patients had malnutrition. According to HAZ, 13.2%, 13.2%, and 36.8% had severe, moderate and mild malnutrition, respectively. According to WAZ, 10.5%, 18.4 %, and 28.6% had severe, moderate and mild malnutrition, respectively. Regarding to WHZ, 14.3%, 28.6 %, had moderate and mild malnutrition, respectively.Low selenium levels and high copper levels were obsevd in 37.5% and 70.3%, respectively.",

Background: Primary immunodeficiencies are group of rare diseases which are difficult to diagnose and manage. Most presenting symptoms were infections from uncommon organisms leading to high morbidity and mortality. Objective: To evaluate clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with primary immunodeficiencies in Thailand. Methods: Medical records of all patients diagnosed and treated for primary immunodeficiency in the past 18 years, at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, were reviewed. Patients with secondary immunodeficiencies and chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. Results: A total of 85 pediatric patients (58 males and 27 females) were registered. The earliest onset of symptom was in the newborn period. IgG subclasss deficiency was the most common primary immunodeficiency diseases (47%), followed by severe combined imuunodeficiencies (17.6%), specific antibody deficiencies (14%), agammaglobulinemia (7.5%), common variable immunodeficiencies (4.5%) and chronic granulomatous disease (4.5%). The most common presenting symptoms of antibody deficiencies were upper respiratory tract infections (49/56, 87.5%). In patients with T-cell immunodeficiencies, most common presentations were PCP pneumonia (9/15, 60%) with septicemia being the most of common presentations among patients with phagocytic defect (2/4, 50%) . There is an increasing trend of early detection of primary immunodeficiency and decreasing diagnostic lag month over the past 18 years.

Introduction: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a valuable treatment for many immune-mediated disorders and it is vital management for those with humoral immunodeficiencies. These individuals receive regular, longterm therapy with IVIG. Adverse events associated with administration of IVIG have been reported. In our specialist unit at Westmead, hospital, Sydney, approximately 850 courses of IVIG are administered annually. Aim: As we have a large experience of IVIG administration, we have performed a retrospective analysis of adverse events (AE) experienced by patients attending our unit. Methods: Retrospective chart review of all IVIG infusions delivered in the last four years was performed. Factors examined were patient demographics, diagnosis, previous administration of IVIG infusion and symptoms of AE. IVIG products utilized were Intragam-P (CSL Bioplasma,Melbourne,Australia.), Sandoglobulin (ZLB Bioplasma A G, Bern, Switzerland.), Octagam (Octapharma AG, Lachen, Switzerland.). Patients receiving IVIG were not routinely pre-medicated with either antihistamines or steroids. Results: In our centre 3,320 infusions of IVIG were given in a 4 year period to 112 patients (46 males -66 females). 49 of the 112 patients had PID. 63 had various autoimmune conditions or treatment induced hypogammaglobulinemia. 50 of the patients were long standing recipients of IVIG and 62 were naBve to any IVIG products. During the 4 years there were 7 AEs observed. 3 of these patients were naBve to any IVIG products. 4 were long-term recipients. 3 patients had PID and the remainder had autoimmune conditions. Discussion: Our review showed that the incidence of AEs associated with IVIG infusions is very low (0.4%) for 3,320 infusions, which are similar to figures reported elsewhere. All AEs may have been preventable as three of the patients were naBve to IVIG and may have benefited from pre-medication and three of the reactions occurred when recommended maximum infusion rates were exceeded. The other reaction occurred due to patient delay between infusions. All patients whom experienced AEs have continued on IVIG without any reoccurrence of AEs and only one of these is routinely premedicated. Therefore, in conclusion, with due regard to infusion rates, timing between infusions and use of pre-medication IVIG is a safe treatment for humeral immunodeficiences and autoimmune disorders.",

In our study we compared complement values in 90 patients with HAE and 212 patients with angioedema of unknown origin. In addition the complement parameters (CH50, C1q, C3, C4, antigenic and functional C1-INH) tested at the time of diagnosis were correlated with age, sex, severity of the disease in 99 patients with HAE type I and 7 patients with type II. Unlikely to the previous findings we have found that out of the complement parameters tested the functional C1-INH had the highest specificity, but the lowest sensitivity in the diagnosis of HAE, while highest specificity was observed with the antigenic C1-INH assay. We did not find correlation between complement levels and age at the time of diagnosis. No association was found between the complement levels and sex or HAE type. We found significant association of baseline functional C1-INH (p=0.0144), and CH50 (p=0.054) levels with the severity of disease. As a conclusion we demonstrated that both antigenic and functional C1-INH is required for the correct diagnosis of HAE and testing of C4 highly validates the results. Determination of funcional C1-INH and C4 may have clinical significance. Regular evaluation of these parameters can be a useful tool in the strategy of long term prophylaxis, however further studies are required to confirm these associations.",

Semmelweis University, 3rd Department OF Internal Medicine, Budapest, Hungary. Background: HAE is characterized by recurrent edematous swellings of the subcutaneous or submucosal tissues. Bradykinin plays an essential role in the development of angioedema. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of the selective bradykinin-B2-receptor-antagonist Icatibant in the treatment of attacks in patients with HAE due to C1-inhibitor deficiency.",

            "text": "During an open-label extension phase of a randomized, double blind, controlled phase III study (FAST-2) patients with cutaneous and/or abdominal attacks of hereditary angioedema were treated with Icatibant. Within 6 hours after the onset of a moderate/severe attack they received a single injection of 30 mg Icatibant subcutaneously. Symptoms were assessed by patient (VAS, symptom score) and by physician (symptom score global assessment, clinical global impression). Results: 6 angioedema attacks in 2 patients with HAE were treated with Icatibant. The affected sites were twice the extremities and once the genitalia in Patient #1. Patient #2 experienced two abdominal attacks, while another attack affected the gastrointestinal tract and one extremity. Clinical symptoms of all attacks improved quickly. Time to first improvement of symptom was 10Y23 minutes. The duration of complete resolution of symptoms was shorter in abdominal attacks compared to attacks involving the subcutaneous tissues (180Y240 min versus 480Y720 min). Drug related adverse events and relapses were not experienced. Local skin reactions at the injection site were tolerable and resolved within 4 hours. Conclusion: IcatibantYwhich differs from earlier drugs concerning both the mode of action and the method of administration as wellYhas been found effective and safe in the treatment of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. The possibility of subcutaneous administration of Icatibant may improve the daily life of patients suffering from HAE. In the present cases repeated use of Icatibant did not result in reduced efficacy. The potential of Icatibant for the treatment of other bradykinin mediated angioedema has to be tested in further studies. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1) is a genetic immunodeficiency disease characterized by life-threatening infection results from the mutations in the leukocyte integrin, CD18 molecule with severe and moderate phenotype. We report a case of severe LAD occurred in a 1 month old girl and a case of moderate LAD which was presented with aggressive periodontitis. Case 1: Clinical features include delayed separation of the umbilical cord, omphalitis, severe bullose and /ulcerative skin eruption which mimic picture of staphylocolal scaled skin syndrom in neonatal period and persistent leukocytosis. The immunological workup showed pathological values of CD11b, CD18 (2.3%, 0.3% respectively). The patient is waiting for BMT now. Case 2: A 4/5 year old boy with aggressive periodontitis in the primary dentition which pathologic examination showed actinomycosis ginigivits and normal separation of umbilical cord. He had CD11b __ 4/6% and CD18 __ 3/ 7% in peripheral blood flow-cytometery compatible with moderate phenotype of LAD1. He is receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusion: Although LDA is a rare form of congenital immuno -deficiency, severe LDA1 should be considered when delayed wound healing and recurrent bacterial skin infections are present in a newborn and moderate LAD1 in aggressive periodontitis with normal wound healing.",

Rationale: X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) is an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by defective intracellular killing of microorganisms due to neutrophils' inability to generate superoxide ions. Although it is caused by mutations in the same CYBB gene, clinical and molecular characteristics vary among different ethnic backgrounds. Materials and Methods: Two unrelated Thai boys presented with severe persistent pulmonary infections at the age of two months. Their abnormal DHR assays supported the diagnosis of X-CGD. Mutation analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the entire coding regions of CYBB. Mutations identified were confirmed by restriction enzyme analyses. Results: PCR-sequencing of the entire coding regions of CYBB identified nonsense mutations, 271C9T (R91X) in exon 4 and 456T9A (Y152X) in exon 5, in probands of each family. Both of the probands' mothers were found to be carriers. Conclusion: This observation supports that CYBB is the gene responsible for X-CGD across different populations and nonsense mutations are associated with severe phenotypes. Background: Inflammatory responses to prior infections due to improved immune responses to latent pathogens with paradoxical clinical worsening observed in HIV-infected patients initiating potent antiretroviral therapy. No case report of cytomegalovirus (CMV) associated CNS IRIS in children. Methods: We report a case with serious atypical adverse events after initiate ARV. Results: A 7 years old Thai girl, CDC C due to wasting syndrome, presented with history of fever and oral candidiasis with CD4% 6%, CD4 count 17 cells/ml, viral load 163,000 copies/ml. After 2 weeks cotrimoxazole for PCP prophylaxis, she started antiretroviral therapy (ARV), stavudine, lamivudune and nevirapine, at Chulalongkorn hospital. One week later, she developed right sided hemiparesis without any history of headache, vomiting and loss of consciousness. The neurological exam revealed right sided weakness with motor power grade IV at both upper and lower extremities, normal reflexes and clonus. The differential diagnoses were cerebral toxoplasmosis, brain abscess and tumor. The CT brain with contrast media revealed generalized brain atrophy without mass or ring enhancement. Lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was colorless and clear with WBC 2 cell/mm3, no RBC, protein 35.9 mg/dl and CSF sugar/ plasma sugar 70/96 mg/dl respectively. CSF bacterial culture was no growth but CSF cytomegalovirus (CMV) was positive through PCR method. MRI brain was shown hypodensity lesion at the right cerebellum. Ophthalmologic examination was normal.After 2 weeks of ARV, her CD4%, CD4 count and viral load were 17%, 202 cells/ml and 440 copies/ml respectively. The diagnosis was Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). However, we did not prescribe any steroids because of the bacteremia. During this period, she continued to take ARV as usual. One month after her hospitalization, she was reexamined to be fine with full motor power. After a total of 6 months of ARV, she was fine with CD4% 13%, CD4 count 356 cells/ml, viral load 50 copies/ml. Conclusion: We reported the CMV IRIS, right hemiparesis, after a week of initiating antiretroviral therapy in an HIV infected girl with severe immunosuppression. The diagnosis of atypical CNS symptoms after initiate ARV with rapidly increased CD4 and decreased viral load should consider as IRIS.",

Background: Diagnosis of bacterial infection in a neutropenic child with fever becomes difficult due to a poor inflammatory response. Currently, a method reliable and fast to identify patients with bacterial infection is not available. CRP has been evaluated in these patients with controversial results. Objective: To determine the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios of CRP for diagnosis of bacterial infection in neutropenic children with fever. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We included patients less than 16 years of age with fever and severe neutropenia (G500 AN/mm3). Blood cultures and CRP were taken in the initial evaluation. All of them, had empirical antimicrobial treatment; their evolution was followed up until discharge. Blood cultures were processed by the automated system BACT-alert; CRP by nephelometry. Patients were classified in 4 groups: Group I: Clinical and bacteriological infection, Group II: Infection clinically defined, Group III: Fever due other causes than infection and Group IV: Patients with cancer, neutropenia without fever. Diagnostic test analysis, receiver operating curves (ROC) and likelihood ratios were performed. Results: One hundred twenty seven episodes were included from 113 subjects. Leukemia was the most frequent disease (61%). Twenty nine, 47, 20 and 31 episodes were included in groups I, II, III and IV respectively. We found microbiological isolation in 29 episodes, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common isolated germs (27.6% and 17.2%). Median for CRP levels (IQR) was of 282 mg/L (174Y385) in group I; 205 mg/L (119Y267) in group II; 27,3 mg/L (12.3Y55) in group III and 5,1 mg/L (2.4Y13) in group IV (pG0.001). By COR curves a CRP level higher than 60 mg/L showed a sensitivity (S) of 94%, specificity (E) 94%, positive PV (PPV) 96% and negative PV (VPN) 92% when we compared groups I and II vs. III; at this cut level, likelihood ratio for a positive result was 15,6 and 0,06 for negative result. Among those patients with diagnosis of solid tumor, S, E, PPV and NPV were of 96, 100, 100 and 95%. We found that none patient with neutropenia, fever with negative blood cultures and without focal infection, with a CRP level lower than 30 mg/L had not bacterial infection. All patients with CRP levels higher than 100 mg/L were infected. Conclusion: CRP is a useful, fast and economic test to identify bacterial infection in the neutropenic patient with cancer and fever.",

Methods: We investigated 127 adult patients with AD according to their skin colonization after treatment with antiinflammatory and antiseptic substances, medical history, severity of AD and sensitization to different allergens. Results: 48 out of 127 patients where colonized with S. aureus. S. aureus colonized patients suffered from a more severe AD (SCORAD: S. aureus positive patients: 46, S. aureus negative patients: 33) and showed a higher sensitization level to different inhalant allergens. Surprisingly, they also suffered more frequently from allergic asthma (S. aureus positive patients: 69%, S. aureus negative patients: 44%). 30 of the 48 S. aureus skincolonizing strains produced \"-t. The severity of AD was similar in patients being colonized with \"-t negative S. aureus (\"-t-pts) compared to patients with \"-t producers (\"-t+ pts). \"-t+ pts had a significally higher specific IgE to birch pollen (median: \"-t+ pts: 100kU/l, \"-tpts: 32kU/l) and a trend of higher total IgE values (median: \"-t+ pts: 6849kU/l, \"-tpts: 2215kU/l) and specific IgE to timothy grass pollen (median: \"-t+ pts: 80kU/l, \"-tpts: 12kU/l). Conclusion: Following topical treatment the colonization rate was lower (38%) than expected. But there was a high rate of patients who were skin colonized with \"-t producing S. aureus. Colonization with S. aureus was associated with a higher severity of atopic dermatitis, higher sensitization, and a higher frequency of allergic asthma. Cutaneous colonization with \"-t producing S. aureus was associated with a higher sensitization to saisonal inhalant allergens in AD.

Background: The association of mycosis or onicomycosis by dermatophyte fungi and allergic diseases including urticaria/angioedema, rhinitis and asthma has been described for over 70 years but large series of confirmed cases have not been published. Methods: From 9087 patients seen in the last few years 98 (1,07%) 20 to 66, 61 males (62,2%), 37 females (37,8%) had a clinical history and previous or actual visible skin or nails infection and positive tests to Tricophyton. Skin tests have been done in all the patients by prick in a first step and by intradermal with 1/1000 and 1/100 dilution in a second step. Specific IgE has been looked by UNICAP for Tricophyton rubrum in 78 cases. Treatment with antifungal itraconazol has been tried as a first option in all the patients. When allergic symptoms subsisted specific immunotherapy by parenteric route has been started with a slow release vaccine during a minimal period of 3 years. Results: Fungal infection presentation was tinea pedis in 66 patients (67,3%), onicomycosis in 36 (36,7%), tinea cruris in 27 (27,6%) and remaining pruritus after clear infection in 3 (3,0%) . Dual infections were present in 33 patients (34,4%). Total of clinical mycosis 129. Allergic disease: urticaria/ angioedema in 64 patients (65,3%), rhinitis in 14 (14,3%), asthma plus rhinitis in 11 (11,2%), eczema in 8 (8,2%) and conjunctivitis in 1 (1,0%). Fifteen patients (15,3%) all rhinitic had also positive skin tests to house dust mites. Prick tests for Tricophyton were positive in 61 patients (62.2%). Intradermal tests were always positive. Specific IgE was positive in 52 (66,6%) cases with a range of 0,50 to more than 100 Ku/l. Treatment with antifungal cleared allergic disease only in 20 (20,4%). Specific immunotherapy has been tried in 60 patients with very good results (complete clearing) in 23 (38,3%), good in 36 (43,3%) and moderate or nil in 11 (9,4%) . Conclusion: Tricophyton IgE mediated allergy play a role in the pathogenesis of Urticaria/angioedena, asthma and rhinitis in most patients. Fungal skin and nails infection must be searched, skin tests and specific IgE used for diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity of skin prick tests and specific IgE are roughly comparable. Specific immunotherapy must be tried if anti fungal therapy failed with good results in most cases.",

Cytokine investigation in homogenizers of liver histology examination samples was performed in the period of CCH clinical manifestation accompanied with cytolysis. As a tool of control the samples of the hepatic tissue belonging to 5 donors who did not have any chronic diseases and markers of being infected with viruses of parenteral hepatitis were used to investigate cytokine levels in homogenizers of liver histology examination samples. In the process of investigation of liver histology examination sample homogenizers in CCH patients it was established that the they have the authentic increase of IL-1!, IL-4, TNF-! proportion and decrease of IL-2, IFN-+ proportion. The considerable fluctuation in proportion levels of each of them from the minimal to the maximal indices was noted and the total distribution differed from the normal one, which hampered the adequate assessment of the investigated indices. The patients were divided into two groups that differed from each other by the median of the low (V0,25) and upper (V0,75) percentiles of the quantitative contents of the local cytokin levels. The first group whose levels of practically all investigated cytokines in liver histology examination samples were authentically different from those of the second group. IL-4 proportion in the second group nearly twice exceeded its index in the first group. The increase of TNF-! level in liver histology examination samples of CCH patients of the second group six times as high as that of the first group was noted. The considerable decrease of the local proportion of IL-2 and IFN-\u00e3 in the second group (0,6 T 0,02 pg/ml versus 16,0 T 0,6 pg/ml, p G 0,001 and 4,2 T 0,65 pg/ml versus 18,9 T 2,7 pg/ml, p G 0,0001 correspondingly) was noted. No difference in IL-1\u00e1 levels in investigated groups was noted (p 9 0,05). In accordance with the local cytokine levels along the median of the extreme percentiles (V0,25 and V0,75) two CVH patient groups were singled out, the groups having the authentic difference in clinical, biochemical and morphological parameters. HFRS is one of the clinical forms of Hantavirus infection that is widely spread on Eurasian continent. In Europe HFRS is predominantly associated with Puumala, Dobrava -Belgrad Hantaviruses (HV), in Asiawith Hantaan, Amur, Seoul. Another clinical form, which is common for the American continent is Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), associated with Sin -Nombre, Andes serotypes. On the south of Far East region, where three serotypes of HV are collected, the similarity of the main pathogenical and clinical aspects of HFRS and HPS were revealed. It is established that in the pathogenesis the important role plays either HV, as the initiator of the process, or the reactions of cellular immunity. The more virulent HV (Sin -Nombre, Andes, Hantaan, Amur) and lass virulent (Puumala, Seoul) are known. The studying of immunopathogenesis in HFRS patients revealed the dependence of characteristics of immune response from the serotype of HV. On the onset of the disease the level of misbalance of serum cytokines (high levels of IFN -!, IL -1!, IL12p70, IL12p40, IL-8, IL-10 and low levels of IFN-+) and also the number of cytotoxic lymphocytes CD8 correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms and the serotype of HV. In HFRS, associated with Hantaan, Amur serotypes severe and complicated manifestations with hemorrhagic syndrome, hyperhydration of kidneys, respiratory tract, liver tissue and multiorganic insufficiency. Severe forms of Seoul -infection were less common and the characteristics of immune and cytokine status were not changed a lot. The studying of the levels of cytokines and metabolites of nitric oxide in urine and exhaled air condensates showed the absence of correlation of their production locally and systemically. That fact reveals the independent synthesis of the immune response mediators and allows supposing the respiratory tract, as the kidneys to be the target -organ of HV. Viremia begins after the respiratory infection of alveolar macrophages and then the central cells of pathogenesis -endothelial cells of the lungs, kidneys and other organs. So, the results of the study of cytokines in different biologic substrates (serum, urine, exhaled air condensates) in the onset of the disease showed the prevalence of immune reactions in the pathogenesis of HFRS without any dependence with the Hantavirus serotype.",

This worm normally live within marine mammals, however frequently induces allergy in the infection of mammals on land by third stage larvae (L3) carried by marine fishes. When L3 infect mammals, these worms develop into fourth stage larvae (L4). Each state larva produces different excretory-secretory products (ESP) in main protein constituents. This investigation compared ESP from L3 (L3ESP) with L4ESP in antigenicity and allergenicity to develop on efficient method to diagnose the allergy by L3, and analyzed cytokine profile in reinfection of L3, which is critical period in allergy development. Methods: The kinetics of specific antibody production of sera harvested from rats infected by L3 was analyzed by indirect ELISA using either L3ESP or L4ESP as antigen immobilized on ELISA plate. The cytokine kinetics of IL-4 and IFN-r was analyzed with rat sera harvested for 5weeks from L3 reinfection. Results: The kinetics of antibody production showed that specific antibody level against L4ESP was higher in antigenicity than the level against L3ESP in IgG1 IgG2b IgG2c and IgM, and very similar in IgG2a. However, the latter had evidently higher allergenicity than the former in specific IgE level. In L3 reinfection sera, the level of IL-4 was relatively constantly maintained. In contrast, that of IFN-Y j +; was decreased continuously. Conclusion: These results indicated that L3ESP be better than L4ESP for allergic state analysis and Th2 cytokine be comparatively dominant in Anisakis simplex larva reinfection.",

Introduction: Jungle honey (JH) is collected from timber and blossom by wild honey bees that live in the tropical forest of Nigeria. This is used on traditional medicine for cold, skin inflammation and burn wound as well as health care. However, the effect of Jungle honey on immunomodulatory activity is not yet clearly. We have investigated the effect of Jungle honey on immune system and anti-tumor activity in mice. Methods: JH was provided by Nihon origins. JH was dissolved with distilled water, and freezed dry, and then adjusted with PBS at each concentration. JH was fractionized to Fraction (Fr.) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 by HPLC size chromatography. Female C57BL/6 mice were injected with JH at dose of 1mg/mouse/day, 7 times intra-peritoneal. After 7 times injections, peritoneal cells (PC) were obtained by peritoneal lavage with PBS. Total numbers of PC were counted with homocytometor. Cell differentials were observed by microscope after Giemsa stain. Expressions of surface antigens (CD3, CD11b, CD19, NK, and Gr-1) on PC were analyzed by FACS. H 2 O 2 production of PC was assayed by FACS using DCFH-DA. Chemotactic assay was analyzed by TAXIScanTM using neutrophils from peripheral blood of human or guinea pig. IL-1$ mRNA expression of PC were analyzed by RT-PCR. Anti-tumor activity was assayed by using Lewis Lung Carcinoma/2. Results: Total numbers of PC were increased in JH-injected mice compared with control mice. In Dot Plot analysis by FACS, neutrophils were increased in JH-injected mice. Percent of Gr-1 surface antigen positive cells and intensity of Gr-1 antigen expression were also increased and H 2 O 2 production of PC was increased by JH. Chemotactic activity for Neutrophil from human or guinea pig was expressed at concentration of 1, 5mg/ml or 1, 5, 10mg/ml of JH. IL-1$ mRNA expression of PC was increased by JH or Fr.2. Molecular weight of Fr.2 was approximately 261. Inhibitor of tumor growth was showed by JH. Conclusion: Chemotactic activity for neutrophils, increase of neutrophil counts and H 2 O 2 production of PC by JH may prevent bacterial and viral infections.",

Aspergillus fumigatus is now the leading cause of infectious mortality in many hematology bone marrow and allograft transplantation. Galactomannan is hetropolysaccharid present in the cell wall of aspergillus species. A rapid and important method for invasive aspergillus diagnostic could be the circulating galactomannan aspergillus (GM) measurement in the serum and BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) samples of the patients. The aim of this study was determined the value of galactomannan detection in serum to diagnosis of invasive aspergillus. Methods and Patients: Fifty three patients (with recurrent pulmonary infection suspected to aspergillus) were included in our study group. None of the selected patients had received any anti fungal therapy prior to the study. Direct microscopy and fungal culture of BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) was done and galactomannan estimation in serum and BAL were measured. Results: 32 patients (960 %) were considered galactomannan test positive from a total 53 cases (30 male and 23 female) and 28 of these patients were isolated aspergillus in microscopy and culture. Conclusion: The GM EIA assay had greater sensitivity than culture and microcopy in detection of aspergillus spp in BAL fluid in experimentally induced invasive pulmonary aspergillus. GM positivity also allowed the anticipation of invasive aspergillus diagnosis (from 3 to30 day before mycological culture).",

            "text": "Revisiting the hygiene hypothesis: Cross-reactivity studies between house dust mites and Ascaris lumbricoides Background: The causal relationship between allergy and ascariasis remains a matter of controversy. Despite growing evidence for protective immunity exerted by helminth infections against allergic diseases, the molecular and immunological mechanisms involved needs to be elucidated. In this study, cross-reactivity of allergens from house dust mites (HDM) Blomia tropicalis (Blo t), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p), and D. farinae (Der f) with antigens from Ascaris lumbricoides (Asc l) was determined. Methods: Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay was performed to determine the allergenicity of HDM extracts and antigenicity of Asc l extracts to allergic (n=100), ascariasis (n=60), and healthy control (n=100) patients. Inhibition assays and Western blot analyses were done using positive sera from allergic (n=15) and ascariasis (n=15). Specific IgE levels of allergic (n=50) and ascariasis patients (n=50) to a recombinant paramyosin peptide (Blo t 11-fD) was determined. Results: The allergenicity of HDM extracts was significantly higher among allergic patients (Blo t=81, Der p=72, and Der p=80% positive reactions) than ascariasis patients (20, 20, and 28.3%, respectively) while the antigenicity of Asc l extracts among allergic patients (70%) was significantly lower than ascariasis patients (87%). Cross-inhibition assay showed that Asc l antigens can inhibit up to 92% of the IgE reactivity of allergic patients to HDM allergens while up to 54% of the IgE reactivity of ascariasis patients to Asc l antigens was inhibited by HDM allergens. Western blot analysis showed multiple sensitizations of allergic patients to HDM allergens with molecular weights ranging from 14Y240 kDa and of ascariasis patients to Asc l antigens ranging from 15Y250 kDa. Positive reactions to rBlo t 11-fD was observed among allergic (80%) and ascariasis (46%) patients. Conclusion: Multiple cross-reactive antigens are present in HDM and Al extracts and may play a role in the complex immunological relationship between allergy and ascariasis. These antigens might share homology or similarity in epitope recognition sites and must be identified in future studies. The potential role of paramyosin as a specific cross-reactive allergen present in HDMs and A. lumbricoides was described. These findings provide support for the Hygiene Hypothesis and may serve as basis for novel forms of treatment and diagnosis of allergic diseases and helminthic infections. . This model allows us to define basic principles of pathogenesis of infection on cellular level. We are able to define precausions of effective macrophage activation leading to subsequent infection elimination. Methods: We followed up the expression of specific macrophages surface markers: CD 86, CD 54 (ICAM-1), CD 16/32 (FcgIII/IIR) and CD 25, including specific isotypic controls. The phenotypic changes expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or percentage of positivity, respectively, were evaluated by flow cytometry. Morphologic changes were documented by immunofluorescence microscopy. Murine macrophage-like cells (J774.2) were incubated in cultivation flasks (2x106 cells/10ml of medium Dulbecco's MEM with Glutamax-1 with 10% BSA). The cells were activated with 5, 10,50 ng of LPS per 1ml of medium or with 10, 100, 1 000, 10 000 I.U. of IFN, per 1ml of medium respectively and infected by F. tularensis LVS with multiplication of infection 1:100 in particular time schemes. Results: Infection of F. tularensis does not result in any activation of host cells, as seen from stable phenotype profile of infected cells in time. In contrary, stimulation of J774.2 cells by IFN, or LPS results in predictable, time and dose dependent phenotypic changes. The phenotype profile of IFN, activated cells is characteristic. These cells display a harmonic increase in CD86 and CD16/32 surface expression in time. In contrary, activation by LPS results in isolated CD16/32 expression elevation without increase in CD86 expression. Moreover, prior F. tularensis infection of macrophages prevents subsequent activation, especially by LPS. We demonstrate an essential role of IFN, in infection control. Minimal concentration of IFN, resulting in active infection elimination is 1000 IU/ml. Conclusion: We assume, that F. tularensis infection is able to interfere with intracellular signaling triggered especially by LPS, less significantly by IFN,. This interference leads to immunosupression and seems to be the efficient escape mechanism of F. tularensis.",

However, the mechanism of immune suppression by CS on AM functions is not clearly understood. Therefore, we investigated effects of CS on phagocytosis and antibody production, expression of surface antigens, IL-1$mRNA in AM associated with immune functions. Methods: Female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 20 cigarettes /day during 10 days. After 10 days, AM were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Phagocytosis activity was analyzed by FACS using FITC labeled seep red blood cell (SRBC). Expression of surface antigens (Class II, B7.1, CD11b, CD16/32, CD14, TLR-2) on AM were analyzed by FACS. IL-1$mRNA expression of AM was analyzed by RT-PCR. Antibody production was analyzed by plaque forming cell (PFC) assay using SRBC antigen. Results: Phagocytosis of AM was significantly decreased in smoked mice (SM) compared with non-smoked mice (NSM). Surface antigens positive cells in AM were decreased in SM compared with NSM. IL-1$mRNA expression of LPS non-stimulated AM was increased, while in case of LPS stimulated AM was decreased in SM compared with NSM. Antibody production was significantly decreased by AM at induction phase, but not expression phase in SM compared with NSM. Conclusion: These results suggest that the inhibition of antibody production is caused by the inhibition of phagocytosis and expression of surface antigens in AM. Such inhibition of AM functions may be increased the risk of bacterial and virus infections.",

Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with immunopathologic features that vary depending on the duration of the lesion. The lesional skin of AD patients shows an increased number of eosinophils in the dermis and superficial Staphylococcus aureus colonization. Our previous study showed that percutaneous application of peptidoglycan (PEG) from S. aureus induced eosinophil infiltration in murine skin through RANTES production by epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs). Although it is well known that PEG is an agonist of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, it is unclear whether other TLR agonists are able to induce RANTES production by LCs. In this study, therefore, RANTES production by murine LCs in response to different TLR stimuli, and the signaling pathways involved, were investigated. Methods: PEG was applied to barrier-disrupted abdominal skin of mice every 5 days. Twenty days later, eosinophils in the abdominal skin were detected. LCs were purified from epidermal cells by the panning method using anti-IA d monoclonal antibody. RANTES production in the skin and by the cultured LCs was investigated by RT-PCR, immunohistologic analysis and ELISA. Analysis of the signaling pathways responsible for RANTES production by LCs was performed by ELISA using N-acetyl-L-cysteine, SP600125, PD98059 and SB203580, which are specific inhibitors of NF-e?B activation, JNK, ERK and p38 MAPK, respectively, and was finally confirmed by Western blot analysis. Results: The results of RT-PCR and ELISA showed that PEG, poly(I:C), LPS and CpG DNA, whose signals are transduced through TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4 and TLR-9, respectively, strongly induced the production of RANTES. Although treatment with an inhibitor of NF-e?B activation inhibited PEG-, poly(I:C)-, LPS-and CpG DNA-induced RANTES production, treatment with a JNK inhibitor did not inhibit CpG DNA-induced RANTES production. Furthermore, treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor affected only PEG-and LPS-induced RANTES production, and the inhibition of RANTES production was correlated with that of p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the signaling pathways involved in RANTES production by murine epidermal LCs in response to different TLR stimuli are not necessarily the same, and that inhibition of p38 MAPK may be a more specific therapeutic strategy for eosinophilic inflammation in AD patients with S. aureus colonization.",

The infection may result in asymptomatic to severe disease which may be fatal. The conventional treatment of hydatid disease is the surgical intervention. Several reports proved that the patients who have widespread disease and no surgical resection is possible, the medical treatment remains the only oportunity. Percutaneous aspiration and treatment of hydatid cysts was believed to be contraindicated due to anaphylaxis and spillage of scolices, however several investigators have reported neither anaphylaxis nor dissemination. The authors present a successful treatment in pulmonary hydatid disease with bronchoscopic investigations combined with mabendazole/albendazole therapy. A nine year old boy was admitted to a county hospital because of intense black vomit without any severe disease in his previous medical history. He lost 8 kgs within a month and once he had bloody split earlier. Chest X-ray showed decreased left side basal transparency.

Repeated CT scan did not prove any improvement and bronchoscopy was required. Cysts were found in the samples removed in the course of bronchoscopy. Histological and serological investigations confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid disease. Repeated bronchoscopy, lavage and 50 mg/ bwkg/day mabendazole then 10 mg/bwkg/day albendazole therapy were continued. After 10 months of combined therapy the patient is in good medical condition (he gained weight, he regulary performs physical activities). Control bronchoscopy and CT scan showed mild bronchiectasis on left side in the S6 segment. After one year from the beginning of the hydatid disease the patient recovered nearly completely. Conclusion: The authors demonstrated the safety and efficacy of combined medical and bronchoscopic treatment in pulmonary hydatid disease.",

Background: There are a few data regarding recurrent wheezing in infants around the world. The aim of study is to verify the prevalence of recurrent wheezing in infants from south of Brazil. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. A standardized questionnaire was applied to parents of infants with 12 to 15 months-old attending Health Centers for regular immunization between August/2005 and December/2006. This instrument was previously validated and had questions about clinical characteristics, wheeze, respiratory infections and risk factors. Among 107 Immunization Centers 35 were randomly selected in order to maintain a homogeneous selection of population sample. Results: Three thousand and three parents answered the surveys. Fourty five percent have had at least one wheezing episode in the first twelve months of life, starting with 5.5 T 3.1 months of age, and 678 (22.6%) have had 3 or more wheezing episodes.

Ain Shams, Pediatrics, Cairo, Egypt. Background: International guidelines for treatment of acute asthma call for measurement of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or other objective tests of pulmonary functions. Such measures, however, are frequently difficult to obtain in young children and those unfamiliar with the technique of PEFR. Therefore a variety of clinical scoring systems have been developed for evaluating the severity of acute exacerbations of asthma in children. Aim: To cmopare between both pediatric asthma severity score BPASS[ and pulmonary score BPS[ as clinical tools to others instrumental measures as peak flow meter, pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases for assessing the severity of acute asthmatic attacks in children. Also, our aim to find if clinical assessment tools are of value for rapid intervention in treatment of acute asthma, compared to laboratory measurements. Patients and Methods: These clinical study was done on 100 ashtmatic children attending ER with acute attacks of asthma. Their age ranged from 5Y16 years during the period from January 2005 to January 2006. Clinical assessment of severity was done by using both BPASS[ and BPS[. The results of assessment were compared to BPEFR[, oxygen saturation and arterial blood gases. Results: There was significant association between BPASS[ and BPEFR[ before treatment, 20 minutes and 24 hours after treatment.There was also significant association between BPS[ and BPEFR[ before treatment, 20 minutes and 24 hours after treatment. There was significant association between both BPASS[ and BPS[ scores and oxygen saturation, after 24 houres of treatment. Conclusion: BPASS^and BPS^are of clinical utility in assessing the severity of asthmatic attacks especialy if the patiant is unable to use the peak flow meter or when pulse oximetry or the peak flow meter are not available.

Azerbaijan State Advanced Training Institute for Doctors, Department of Pediatrics, Baku, Azerbaijan. Background: To study features of immune infringements at children with a pathology biliar systems proceeding on a background of allergic diseases. Methods: Under supervision there were 36 children with bronchial asthma (BA). To all children determined a level of general IgE, absolute quantity of basofils in a peripheral blood. Results: At all surveyed children deformations of a bilious bubble (Sfigurative, prezense of excesses in the field of a body, a bottom and cervix ) have been revealed. Thus similar features of a structure of a bilious bubble frequently were found out in parents of surveyed children. Clinical displays were characterized by an abundance and polymorphism of complaints. The incidental nausea and vomiting was observed at 21 % surveyed with BA. Dispepsia frustration were observed at 7 %, locks at 28 %, meteorism at 10 %, abdominal a painful syndrome at 18 % of surveyed children. At the majority of patients complaints of vegetative character were marked. The increase of local or general sweating was established in all the patients. Patients complaints of undue fatigability, emotional lability, sleeplessness, headaches, dizzy. Disturbance of thermoregulation manifested itself by chilling and fall in temperature of distal parts of extremities. Significant meteotropism was discovered in children with BA (46,4 %), that caused the aggravation of general condition in change of weather. At children with the expressed clinical displays of a pathology biliar systems the tendency to higher parameters of the general IgE (514 T 303 IU/ml), than at children with asymptomatic current of illness (320 T 200 IU/ml) was marked. At 15 % of children IgE was within the limits of norm. Correlation analyses between level of general IgE and quantity of basofile showed the positive correlation r=+0.63. One of in children with the level of general IgE in limit norms observed increasing quantity of basofiles peripheral blood.

Na Homolce Hospital, Ctr Allergol Clin Immunol, Prague, Czech Republic. Background: It is generally held that a comprehensive therapy for allergic children includes thalassotherapy, i.e. seaside treatment. We have attempted to objectify the effect of this therapy in two groups of children: one with the diagnosis of bronchial asthma, the other with atopic eczema. Methods: The effect of a three weeks`seaside stay was evaluated in a group of 31 asthmatic children, compared to 23 asthmatic children in a control group. The evaluation was based on the following criteria: change of activity score, pulmonary functions, price of an anti-asthmatic pharmacotherapy, number of school absences and parent questionnaires. In the second group, which included 25 children with atopic eczema, the effect was evaluated on the basis of the extent of skin affliction, intensity of the symptoms, SCORAD index and parent questionnaires. Results: In the group of asthmatic children, the score fell from 3.8 to 1.9 (with no change in the control group). The difficulties became less frequent, dyspnea on exertion was alleviated, drug consumption fell, school absences and the price of anti-asthmatic therapy were reduced. Pulmonary functions remained unchanged. In the group of eczematous children the extent of skin affliction fell from an average of 8.68 % to 1.88 %. The score reflecting the intensity of difficulties fell on average from 2.44 to 0.56 points with each child. The average value of the SCORAD index in the whole group before treatment was 10.26, after treatment 2.32. The changes of all evaluated parameters are of statistical significance. Conclusion: A three week therapeutic seaside treatment reduces the activity of bronchial asthma and atopic eczema and markedly improves an allergic patient`s quality of life.",

Background: Sensitization to allergens derived from house dust mites (HDM) is strongly associated with asthma, perennial rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Its diagnosis is considered crucial in the allergic work up of these conditions. An increasing number of reports demonstrate the accuracy of atopy patch test (APT) in the diagnosis of HDM allergy. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new ready-to-use HDM atopy patch test (APT) (Diallertest\\) in the diagnosis of sensitization to HDM in children. Methods: A prospective study was carried out in 47 children, age 57.4 T 42 (mean T SD, ranges 7-176 mo), 18 girls. Patients exhibited isolated or combined atopic dermatitis (AD) (n=28, 59.57%).

Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Mexico City, Mexico. Introduction: The allergic diseases are the most frequent chronic entities in the childhood, through the time their prevalence has been increased in the last three decades, that is why it was deasigned a task force called International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) that promotes the epidemiological researches in asthma and allergic diseases. Objective: To approach the prevalence and severity of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis in children between 6 and 7 year and 13 and 14 year old in the southwest of Mexico City. Methods and Materials: It is an observational, transversal, descriptive, prospective study, it includes students of first and second grade of primary school whit age of 6 and 7 year old and junior high school students from 13 to 14 year old. The study was authorized by the Public Education Institute, school principal and parents. The statistical analysis was made by Epi info version 6 whit a significative value of p e 0.05. Results: There were 58 schools enrolled, with 6184 students from wouthwest of Mexico city, 32 primary schools with 3093, 1585 girls (51.24%) and 1508 boys (48.75); junior high schools included 3034 students and 26 schools with 1538 girls (50.69%) and 1496 boys (49.30%). In the scholastic population the antecedent of only one wheezing episode was present in 20.43% (632) and the proportion of patients with severe asthma was 6.7% (207), from this data only 4.3% (134) had asthma diagnosded, in the teenagers only 172 (5.66%) had diagnostic. The severe rhinoconjunctivitis was present in 399 kids (25.99%) and only 103 teenagers (11.26%). The major part of students, kids and adolescents did not give correctly the information, about atopic dermatitis, only 9 (0.29%) joined with pets (cats and dogs). Discussion: Similar studies made around the world reveals that asthma and allergic diseases are a public health problem, with implications in quality of life, it may lead to temporal o permanent incapacity, if they are not diagnoses and treated in early approach. The variation in the prevalence are expected because various factors, the most important is the diversity of each zone about risk factors, in fact the results can not be compared with a different population, they can be used for the epidemiological knowledge of this zone.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate physical activity and its limitation in asthmatic children. The method used. The study group included children suffering from asthma between the ages of 7 and 17. The severity of asthma was assessed by grading the asthma as mild, moderate or severe. We used standardized and diseasespecific PAQL questionnaire (national version). Responses of 186 asthmatic children were analyzed. The results obtaines. Only one third of our respondents were involved in extra activity: sport, dancing and singing. 62.9 % of parents noticed that their children have no extra activity. 17,7% of children with asthma were not attending sports at their school. We asked childrens to name three activities, in which they had been bothered by asthma. 16,6 % of respondents indicated more than three daily activities, restricted by asthma. Asthma for boys was the most disturbing while running (85.2%), playing with pets (23.8%), playing ball (25%) and sleeping (26%). Girls marked different activities, such as running (64%), housekeeping (46.9%) and school sports (25%). Asthma bothered boys on the run and playing ball more often than girls. Girls were bothered by asthma more often than boys when doing chores and singing. Statistically significant differences were found comparing all the three main activities for boys and girls: the first activity -\u00c2 2 = 44.9, df = 15, p G 0.001; the second activity -\u00c2 2 = 42.8, df = 26, p = 0.02; the third activity -\u00c2 2 = 47.9, df = 23, p = 0.002. The conclusion reached. Asthma is a limiting factor in the childrenFs level of physical activity. It prevents children from doing various activities. Due to asthma, children were not able to run, play ball, do their chores, play with their pets. Boys more often complained thet asthma had limited their physical activity (running, playing games), whereas girls indicated that the disease had limited both, their physical activity (such as running) as well as passive activities (such as doing chores, in addition to dancing and singing).",

Intranasal corticosteroid is the most effective medication for chronic rhinitis treatment. Recently, leukotriene receptor antagonist has been added to the modes of therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration of allergic rhinitis. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of add-on montelukast with intranasal corticosteroid in children with chronic and persistent rhinitis. Methods: We enrolled children attending the allergy clinic, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, with poorly controlled rhinitis during the period of April, 2005 to December, 2006. Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was made by positive prick skin test to at least one aeroallergen. Intranasal corticosteroid was the first-line medication for treatment of persistent symptoms. Montelukast was added in cases that no response to intranasal corticosteroid, mostly due to nasal congestion. Efficacy was assessed by symptom improvement (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, itching, sneezing) reported by patients and physical examination by allergist. Results: There were 10 boys and 16 girls (average age 13). The mean duration of symptom before diagnosis was 4.7 years. Twelve children were diagnosed to be allergic rhinitis and 14 children were non-allergic rhinitis by prick skin testing. The mean duration of intranasal steroid use was 4.4 year in children with allergic rhinitis and 2.7 years in children with non-allergic rhinitis. Symptom improvement, especially nasal congestion, was reported in 8 of 12 (66.6%) allergic rhinitis subjects and 11 of 14 (78.5%) non-allergic rhinitis subjects after add-on 10 mg of montelukast daily. Montelukast was overall well tolerated. Mean duration of montelukast therapy was 1.7 years in both groups. Intranasal corticosteroid was able to stop in 8 of 14 (57%) children with nonallergic rhinitis and unable to stop in all children with allergic rhinitis, but all of the patients were satisfied with these treatment. Conclusion: Montelukast have an advantage in additional treatment of either allergic or non-allergic rhinitis children, but particularly more benefit on children with non-allergic rhinitis.",

Background: Asthma is leading cause of chronic illness with increased vascularity, vascular permeability, airway and lung tissue remodeling. Although, various growth factors and cytokines have been implicated in modulating in these processes, the role of factors and cytokines are not known very well in asthmatic children. Aim of this study is to determine the serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF$2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-2-receptor (IL-2R), and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in acute astmatic children (AAC) and compare with acute bronchiolitis and healthy subjects and to assess the changes with treatment. Methods: These parameters were measured by ELISA techniques in AAC and bronchiolitis patients before and after inhaled or systemic steroid (SS). Results: Serum VEGF, TGF$2, IL-4 and IL-2R levels were increased in patients with AAC and bronchiolitis than in controls before therapy. These parameters were higher in AAC than bronchiolitis except IL-2R (Table-I Serum VEGF, IL-2R and ECP levels were higher in AAC than in controls after treatment. After steroid therapy, VEGF, IL-4 and ECP levels were higher in AAC than in bronchiolitis but IL-2R levels were higher in patients with bronchiolitis. Only serum IL-4 levels in bronchiolitis were similar with controls after treatment. By the severity of disease, only VEGF levels were increased in modarate AAC and bronchiolitis higher than in mild patients (p G 0,0001). Only VEGF levels were lower in AAC who were treated with prophylactic drugs than in AAC without prophylactic treatment (p G 0,05). According to modality of steroid treatment, only VEGF levels were lower in AAC who were treated with inhaled steroids compared with SS(p G 0,001). In AAC; VEGF, IL-4, IL-2R and ECP levels were higher than in controls after treatment with SS (p G 0,0001). But in AAC who were treated with inhaled steroids, VEGF and IL-4 levels were similar with controls after treatment (p 9 0,05). Conclusion: VEGF, TGF$2, IL-4 and IL-2R may play role in pathogenesis of asthma and bronchiolitis. These parameters aren't useful for distinguishing asthma and bronchiolitis.

            "text": "Effect of self-management education on asthma complication and pulmonary function in Iranian children with asthma Background: Despite global efforts to manage asthma, the adverse outcome of this disease is increasing. Effective self-management and treatment compliance is important in achieving good symptom control in asthma. The aim of this study was to determine whether asthma nurse intervention during clinical period could increase knowledge and improve self-management and whether this would influence the frequency and severity of symptoms, and pulmonary function test. Setting: A university hospital pediatric outpatient clinic. Methods: Randomized controlled trial of 60 children with intermittent and mild to moderate persistent asthma were assessed to indicate whether the educational self-management intervention would improve lung function and the use of inhaler with spacer score, increase feeling of control over asthma, and decrease the use of health care services. 60 children with asthma, who were categorized based on disease severity, duration of disease, age were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=30) which received an educational program or to a comparison group (n=30) which received common education. The education program consisted of 4 group sessions which focused on improving the patients and parents' self-management skills. Background: Chronic cough lasting 8 weeks or more often seems an intractable problem in childhood. Toxocara infestation is associated with an increased prevalence of airway symptoms and may be the possible etiologic agent of chronic cough. Methods: Spirometry, bronchial reversibility tests and nonspecific bronchus provocation tests were carried out in patients who could cooperate in these tests. Measurements were made of the peripheral blood eosinophil count, the serum total IgE level, the serum total magnesium (Mg) concentration. The serological examination for Toxocara canis, based on the most widely used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of IgG (Toxocara canis IgG ELISA, Novatec, Germany) and more sensitive Western blotting (Toxocara Western Blot IgG, LDBIO, France) methods, was performed. All patients with positive serology for T. canis index of positivity 9 9 were treated with albendazole in a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, patients weighing 9 40 kg received 400 mg albendazole a day for 7 days. All patients with bronchial asthma and CVA were treated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Further, short-term beta2-mimetics could be administered in cases of dyspnoea Bas needed^. Results: One-hundred and thirty-six of 425 children (32%) aged 2Y17 years were seropositive for T. canis antigens. Ninety-three children were adequately assessed, diagnosed and followed up during 1 year. Bronchial asthma was diagnosed in 40%, cough variant asthma (CVA) in 27% and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB) in 33% of children with chronic cough. The eosinophil cell count, the Toxocara canis IgG, the total IgE levels and the total Mg concentrations in the serum are predictors of the improvement or the decline of the patients`condition. We could significantly decrease the dose of ICS in 23 of 37 (62%) children with bronchial asthma. Anthelminthics and avoidance were sufficient for children with NAEB; none needed ICS. ICS therapy could be stopped 2-3 months later in 17 (68%) of 25 patients with CVA. We found that 8 of 25 patients with CVA (32%) presented asthmatic symptoms at the end of the 1-year period. Conclusion: In Hungary, T. canis may be the potential sensitizer for chronic cough in seropositive children. Deworming therapy will then alleviate the airway symptoms without exacerbation in patients with bronchial asthma, and definitively treat children with NAEB and the majority of children with CVA. It is supposed that prenatal Th1/Th2 polarization of immune response is possible, but the markers of such polarization, trustworthy associated with atopy forming are not known. Aim: To evaluate the connection between IgE level, CD26, CD30 expression and intracellular interferon (IFN)-, production by cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) and the risk of infant atopic dermatitis (AD) forming. Methods: We defined per cent content of CD26+and CD30+in CBMC by using flow cytometry as well as the concentration of total IgE in 117 full-term newborns. Simultaneously, intracellular IFN-, expression as well as early activation marker CD69 (separate for total mononuclear cells population and CD4+lymphocytes) were examined (95 newborns). We estimated AD presence in 41 enrolled newborns in the age of one year (medically diagnosed AD was marked in 25 of them). Data are shown as median (25-75% quartiles) of absolute cells count (10(-)6/l). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Relative Risk (RR) was present with 95% CI. Results: Only for nonactivated CBMC, producing IFN-, (subtype CD69-/ IFN-,+), the association with AD forming has been found. The number of CD69-/IFN-,+CBMC in AD infants was 3.3 (0-6.4), as opposed to infants without AD -9.4 (5.3-16.5), p = 0.006. Relative risk for AD forming in newborns with low CD69-/IFN-,+( G 5.0 -median for our cohort) was 3.4 (1.19-9.69 ). Significant differences in the number of CD69-/IFN-,+CBMC was kept after adjusting to such factors as family atopic history, place of living (city/village), birth order (first/second or later), the number of family members living together, bedsharing smoking, pets owing and the newborn gender.We revealed the negative concentration of total IgE in cord blood with the ratio CD26+/CD30+CBMC (r = j0.37, p = 0.0005). We did not find any association of CD26, CD30 expression, the CD26/CD30 ratio, as well as the level of total IgE with AD forming in infants (medians were chosen as cut off points). RRs were 1.5 (0.67-3.33), 0.67 (0.37-1.19), 0.78 (0.42-1.45) and 1.24 (0.59-2.61), respectively. Conclusion: Thus, the decreasing of intracellular IFN-, production by nonactivated CBMC, proving the prenatal displacement in Th1/Th2 balance, is the strong predictor of infant AD forming. However, the decreasing of CD26/ CD30 ratio as well as the level of total IgE in cord blood are not the predictors of atopic phenotype forming in infants.",

Increased proportion of sputum eosinophils have been observed among subjects with asthma, especially among those with exacerbation. However, there are also studies that show airway eosinophilia among patients with controlled asthma. Objective: To determine sputum eosinophil level among asthmatic patients in exacerbation and those with stable asthma and determine its association with severity of disease. Methodology: Following clinical assessment and peak flow determination, sputum eosinophil level was determined among patients with stable asthma (n = 29), mild (n = 18) and moderate to severe (n = 18) asthma exacerbation. Age, sex, atopic status, asthma duration and medications were obtained. Sputum eosinophil count of Q 3% was considered significant. Results: The mean eosinophil count in children with stable asthma, mild exacerbation and moderate to severe exacerbation were 4.65% T 12.53%, 1.94% T 4.30%, and 8.83% T 11.12% respectively. Sputum eosinophils were significantly higher in children with moderate to severe exacerbation than in mild exacerbation and stable asthma (p = 0.0086). The percentage of patients with significant sputum eosinophilia was higher among those with moderate to severe exacerbation (17%) than mild exacerbation (6%) and stable asthma (8%). Statistically significant difference was seen among the three population (p = 0.0234). Logistic regressions showed that wheezing (p = G 0.0001), peak expiratory flow rate (p = 0.0010), sex (p = 0.0110) and asthma duration (0.0232) were significantly associated with sputum eosinophilia (p = 0.432).

However its role in children has not been defined. We investigateed associations between asthma-related phenotypes and TBXA2R polymorphism, and also to analyze whether TBXA2R polymorphism has an effect on the efficacy of the leukotriene receptor antagonist(LTRA), montelukast, in asthmatic children with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Methods: Asthmatic children(n = 695) and control children(n = 159) were evaluated for asthma-related phenotypes including total IgE, pulmonary function test, and BHR to methacholine or exercise. Genotypes were detected by PCR-RFLP. In the montelukast study, exercise challenge was performed before and after 8-week montelukast treatment. Results: The TBXA2R polymorphism was not associated with asthma susceptibility and clinical parameters of asthma. However, asthmatic children with combinations of the TBXA2R + 795T 9 C and + 924T 9 C risk alleles had significantly higher total IgE levels (P = .01), total eosinophil counts (P G .01) and lower FEV1 (P = .02) and FEF 25Y75% (P = .02) than those carrying the common alleles. When compared with individuals with the common alleles, in patients with the TBXA2R + 924T 9 C TT homozygote and TBXA2R+795T 9 C hetero-or homozygote (CT or CC) had a 3.67-fold poor response to 8-week montelukast treatment regarding to maximum percent fall in FEV1 after exercise (odd ratio, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.15-11.15). Conclusion: A combined effect of TBXA2R + 795T 9 C and + 924T 9 C risk alleles may be linked to IgE production, eosinophilic inflammation, and severity of asthma. In addition, the combined genotype of TBXA2R may be a predictive marker of clinical response to the LTRA in Korean asthmatic children with EIB.",

Background and Aim: Probiotics may have immunomodulatory functions, exerting beneficial effects in allergic disease. We investigated whether prolonged daily consumption of Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 fermented milk improve health status of children aged 3-6 years allergic to inhalants. Methods: In a randomised prospective double blind controlled trial patients were randomly assigned to receive for one year 100 ml per day of L. casei DN-114 001 fermented milk (109 cells/ml), or no probiotics (controls). Clinical evaluations occurred every 3 months. Faecal flora composition was assessed every 6 months (30 treated, 15 controls). Outcome measures were time free from and the number of episodes of asthma/rhinitis, number of fever or diarrhoea episodes, IgE-G-A serological levels (12 months vs baseline). Results: Participants (187; 92 treated) were similar regarding gestational age, breastfeeding, family smokers, pets, siblings, day-care admission. No statistical difference between intervention and control group occurred in asthmatic children. In children with rhinitis, the annual number of rhinitis episodes was lower in the intervention group, mean difference (95%CI), -1.6 ( -3.15 to -0.05); the mean duration of an episode of diarrhoea was lower in the intervention group, mean difference -0.81 (-1.52 to -0.10) days.

Sagamihara National Hospital, Clinical Research Center, Department of Allergy, Sagamihara-City, Kanagawa, Japan. Background: We have maintained birth cohort study in Sagamihara-City since 2002 to clarify the prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy (FA), bronchial asthma (BA), and Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCP) from infancy to childhood. Methods: Using the mass medical examination system at the age of 4 months (mo) old, we first had obtained information of eczema, nutrition method, family history of allergic diseases, and results of allergy examination by questionnaire. We followed up the subjects, whose parents agreed to participate in this study, at the age of 8 mo, 12 mo and 3 years (y) old using questionnaire by mail. Furthermore the risk factors for the subjects to develop BA by the age of 3 y were analyzed from the information obtained in the study. Results: Informed consent was obtained from 5247 parents of 4 mo infants out of 5932 parents from 1/1/02 to 12/31/02. We could follow up 4214 infants at the age of 8 mo, 4068 infants at the age of 12 mo, and 2888 children at the age of 3 y. The incidence of chronic eczema to suspect AD at 8 mo, 12 mo and 3 y was 18.8%, 13.3% and 14.8%, respectively. The incidence of food elimination due to FA reported by parents at 8 mo, 12 mo and 3 y was 17.0%, 12.8% and 5.4% respectively. Interestingly, the incidence of doctor-diagnosed FA at 8 mo, 12 mo and 3 y was 2.4%, 2.8% and 5.1% respectively. Confusion related to FA and AD during infancy seems to exist between parents and doctors. The prevalence of BA at 12 mo and 3 y was 2.9% and 8.7% respectively. The risk factors for infants to develop BA by 3y were related to the possession of AD or FA at 8 mo, 12 mo and 3 y, family history of allergic diseases and history of indirect cigarette exposure. The incidence of JCP at 3 y was even 3.0%. Conclusion: Since the population of children in Sagamihara-city represents about 5% of that of Japan, we can now estimate the prevalence of allergic diseases from infancy to childhood by the data obtained in this study. However, it was very difficult to estimate the prevalence of FA especially during infancy due to the under-evaluation by doctors and over-reaction by parents. It is important for both doctors and parents to fix the confusion in our society. The data can make us possible to clarify the prevalence of pediatric allergic diseases and to reveal the transition of the diseases.",

Results: Supplementation of GOS/FOS has lead to a significant reduction in the plasma level of total IgE (p = 0.007), IgG1 (p = 0.0054), IgG2 (p = 0.029) and IgG3 (p = 0.0343) immunoglobulins whereas no significant effect on IgG4 was observed. The plasma levels of CMP specific IgG1 was significantly decreased (p = 0.015) in the GOS/FOS group. The levels of CMP specific IgE were very low and no effect of GOS/FOS supplementation could be observed. CMP specific IgG4 was not detectable in the samples.

            "text": "Conclusion: Evidently GOS/FOS supplementation induced an anti-allergic immunoglobulin profile in infants at high risk for allergic diseases whereas desired specific immune responses were not affected indicating the potential role of oral GOS/FOS exposure for primary prevention of allergies. Background: An altered microbial exposure may underlie the increase of allergic disease in affluent societies. Early colonisation with Bifidobacterium (B.) and Lactobacilli (L.) have been postulated to prevent children from developing allergy, while Clostridium (C.) difficile colonisation has been associated with allergic disease. Previous studies have mainly been performed with culture dependent techniques. However, lately the sequencing of bacterial genomes has made it possible to study the gut flora with molecular techniques. The Real-time PCR technique uses primers targeting conserved genes of bacteria, leading to efficient qualitative and quantitative analysis of bacterial DNA from faecal samples. Methods: Presence and amounts of bacterial DNA in infant faecal samples, collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months, were measured with Real-time PCR and related to allergy development in Swedish children, followed prospectively at 6, 12, 24 and 60 months of age. Children regarded as allergic (n=14) had developed allergic symptoms and sensitisation to food and/or inhalant allergens during their first five years of life while non-allergic children (n=23) were non-sensitised without symptoms. Primers binding to C. difficile, B. bifidum, B. longum/infantis, B. adolescentis, B. breve, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacilli group I (L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei, L. casei) and Lactobacilli group II (L. gasseri, L. johnsonii group) were used. Results: The most abundant bacteria were B. longum/infantis while few children were colonised with C. difficile. At one week of age none of the allergic children was colonised with Lactobacilli group I compared to 56% of the children who remained non-allergic (p=0.004). Also, at 1 month of age B. adolescentis was more common in non-allergic than allergic children (p=0.008). Furthermore, the persistent colonisation with these bacteria were more common among non-allergic children, p=0.018 and p=0.060 respectively. Conclusion: A more diverse gut flora might prevent allergy development and the early colonisation might be of major importance. Aim: To evaluate the efficacity of educational activity from School of Asthma in children with asthma and/or their family. Methods and Materials: In the school of asthma children the specialists have performed educational activities in 172 children with different forms of asthma and their parents. Educational seminars consisted of 5 sessions which approached the following subjects: triggers, asthma symptoms, prophylaxis and asthma medicines. Each session also included individual interrogation of the trained to estimate their knowledge of asthma before and after the education session according to the theme of the working day. The quality of knowledge of some children with asthma and/or their parents was also tested after 3Y12 months and afterwards visits. Results: It was found that the knowledge-of children and parents before the training at the School of Asthma Children was incomplete and incorrect. Children with severe asthma had wrong knowledge about triggers (47,73%), about prophylaxis (52,76%) comparatively with those who suffer of mild asthma (58,06% and 60,76% respectively) and moderate (51,81% and 55,94% respectively). Knowledge of children with mild asthma referring in triggers has grown to 90,77%, of children with moderate asthma to 83,72% and those with severe asthma to 80%. Also was established a growth in knowledge about prophylaxis in all groups of children: mild asthma-83,82%, moderate asthma -85,72%, severe asthma -79,26%. Knowledge of children regarding clinic manifestations constituted: mild asthma -5,5%, moderate asthma -74,79%, severe asthma -78,28%. Knowledge level under the subject \"treatment\" is the most incomplete in all groups of the questioned persons: mild asthma -37,93%, moderate asthma -36,96%, severe asthma -38,78%. Towards the end of the course they were appreciated as follows: mild asthma -63,17%, moderate asthma -72,67%, severe asthma -73,0%. The average of knowledge in all groups of children after 3Y12 month referring triggers was 79,72%, about prophylaxis 79,01%, regarding clinic manifestations -69,75% and referring treatment -52,44%. For compare, the average of knowledge before educational activity was: referring triggers -52,43%, prophylactic measures -56,32%, clinic manifestations -45,95% and treatment -37,89%. Conclusion: The knowledge of those questioned has little decreased during 3Y12 months, but it remained net superior to the level before the seminars.",

Results: Among the 13 premature infants tested, the digestive symptoms disappeared under amino-acid formula in 10. Diallertest\\ was positive in 7 cases. All infants with a positive Diallertest\\ improved with the amino-acid formula (no false positive) and 1 child with a negative Diallertest\\ improved with the diet (1 false negative).

Alexandra Szab\u00f3, Gy\u00f6rgyi Mezei, and Endre Cserh\u00e1ti. Semmelweis University, First Department of Pediatrics, Budapest, Hungary. Aim: The study's objective was to examine the consequences of overall asthma severity and current asthma control regarding psychological symptoms in paediatric asthma. Methods: 108 patients, age: 11.75T3.10 (meanTSD) years; (boys 11.6T2.8 years and girls 12.1T3.7 years) completed the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (H.STAIC), the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ), and a symptom score. FEV1 was also measured. Results: Mean FEV1% was 97.4T12.8. Twenty-three patients (21%) had intermittent asthma, 40 patients (37%) had mild persistent, 43 patients (40%) had moderate persistent, 2 patients (2%) had severe persistent asthma. The only factor associated with depression is: FEV1% less than 100. Factors associated with anxiety are: night symptoms, asthma control. Factors associated with quality of life are: the age at the beginning of asthma, asthma duration, current symptoms, night symptoms, day symptoms. Factors that have no association with the above are: disease severity, other allergies, skin test positivity. Conclusion: Not the overall disease severity, other allergic co-morbidities, but more the current asthma status and level of control alter the psychological status of the asthmatic child. They can distinguish between very small changes in the level of control. Thus professional asthma care should focus on achieving the best possible asthma control at all times.",

The cause for such exaggerated response to a common infection is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be associated with pre-existing abnormal pulmonary function. Aim: To compare lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in newborns who later develop severe RSV bronchiolitis and infants who do not develop such severe infection. Methods: A prospective birth cohort study (Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood) was conducted in 411 infants of asthmatic mothers. Lung function was scheduled at 1 month of age by means of the raised volume rapid thoraco-abdominal compression technique during sedation measuring forced expiratory volume at 0.5 s (FEV0.5). Bronchial responsiveness was determined by metacholine challenge using transcutaneous oxygen as endpoint (PD15-TcO2). We defined severe RSV bronchiolitis as a child admitted to hospital or requiring medication with high-dose inhaled budesonide (9800mcg) or oral prednisolone for RSV-verified bronchiolitis. Results: In this prospective cohort study 23 children developed severe RSV infection before age 2 (mean age, 8 months). All completed baseline lung function measurements before subsequent RSV infection. Children with severe RSV infection and controls never presenting severe RSV bronchiolitis did not differ significantly at baseline lung function (FEV0.5) or metacholine challenge (log PD15-TcO2); p-value90.1 for all comparisons. Conclusion: Severe RSV infection in infancy was not associated with preexisting abnormal lung function and bronchial hyperreactivity. Background: Several studies have explored the role of probiotics in the treatment or prevention of atopic diseases. The findings were however inconclusive. Objective: To assess the effect of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG supplementation in the first 6 months of life on the incidence of eczema and allergen sensitization in the first year in high risk Asian infants. Materials and Methods: Infants (n = 253) with a first degree relative with a family history of allergic disease and sensitization to dust mites were randomized in a double blind, placebo-controlled manner to receive a cow`s milk based infant formula with or without probiotics (daily dose of 1x10 9 colony-forming units (CFUs) of Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG) for the first 6 months of life. Subjects were assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months for atopic diseases and skin prick test was conducted at the 12 month visit. Results: Out of 253 subjects, 235 were followed-up to 12 months (drop out rate 7%). The subjects in the two treatment groups were comparable in terms of demographic and birth characteristics, except for gender and birth order. Incidence of eczema in the probiotic (n = 33/122; 27%) group was found to be similar to placebo (n = 33/113; 28%) (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.89). There was no difference in the rate of sensitization to common allergens (probiotic = 25% vs placebo = 21%, OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.45). Sensitization to dust mite allergens (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Blomia tropicalis) was the most common (Probiotic = 20% vs Control = 18%), followed by eggs (Probiotic = 6% vs control = 5%). None of the subjects were sensitized to cow`s milk or soy. Potential confounding factors including birth order, household size, smoking exposure, presence of pets and breastfeeding did not affect these outcome measures. Adjustment for imbalance of gender and birth order between treatment groups did not affect the findings significantly.",

Aim: This study aims to monitor the intestinal transit of a probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium longum BB536) in the first 6 months of life in at risk infants (first degree relative with allergic disease) participating in an ongoing randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial. Effect of this supplementation on Bifidobacterium infantis prevalence was also investigated. This particular bifidobacterial species has been implicated as a potential signature of infants at low prevalence of atopy. Methods: Newborns at risk of allergies received either probiotic preparation (n = 55) or placebo (n = 48) daily for the first 6 months of life. Analysis of fecal bacteria and clinical examinations were conducted serially at birth, 1, 3, and 12 months. Bacterial DNA extracted from fecal samples was evaluated with nucleic acid amplification approach using specific PCR primers targeting Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium infantis. Results: All extracted DNA samples were amplified with universal primers targeting a conserved region of 16S rRNA to ensure extraction of intact DNA. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was more commonly detected in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group [at 3 days (94.1% vs 6.8%), 1-month (92.7% vs 14.9 %), 3-month (86.5% vs 21.3%, respectively) (pG0.0001)] but not significantly at 1-year old (28.8% vs 14.9%, p90.05). Infants supplemented with probiotics were also more likely to harbour Bifidobacterium infantis at 3 months (n = 19/52; 36.5%) compared to placebo (n = 7/47; 14.9%) groups (p = 0.0267). Conclusion: Our data suggests that probiotic supplementation from birth may modulate the intestinal bifidobacterial species composition. Its effect on allergy outcomes remains to be examined. Objective: The main objectives of this study was to establish allergen sensitization in a large proportion of children who required hospitalisation for a severe exacerbation of their asthma. Material and Methods: Patients hospitalised at the Victor Fouche Hospital were monitored from 2002 to 2005. Patients were contacted by phone after leaving the hospital. Afterwards, they were skin tested with 16 common aeroallergens, including 4 mite species, 3 cockroaches, cat and dog, grasses and 4 foods. A detailed questionnaire concerning environmental and social risk factors was answered by the parents. Results: A total of 632 hospitalisations were counted in this period of time. A total of 492 children (294 boys and 198 girls; mean age 5.93 years) were hospitalised. The mean number of hospitalisations per child was 1.3 (1 to 8 times). The mean days of admission per patient was 2.81 (1 to 27). The number of hospitalisations in 2002 were 156, in 2003, 191; in 2004, 148 and in 2005 137 . A total of 269 patients (54.67%) (159 boys and 110 girls) agreed to undergo skin testing. From this group, 11 had been skin tested prior to the entry in the study and 3 had started, and abandoned, immunotherapy. One hundred ninety six (72.86%) children had at least 1 positive skin test; 158 (58.74%) were sensitised to at least 3 allergens. 183 (68.03%) were positive to at least 1 mite species; 99 (36.8%) to at least 1 cockroach species; 63 (23.42%) to at least one food, among these, 61 were sensitised to shrimps; 18 (6.69%) were sensitised to cat and 14 (5.2%) to dog and just 5 (1.86%) to grass pollen. Conclusion: We have identified a high rate of sensitization to aeroallergens in a large cohort of young paediatric patients with severe asthma that required hospitalisation in Martinique. Mites, cockroaches and shrimps accounted for the largest number of sensitisations. These results are similar to those obtained in a control group of allergic children being evaluated for allergic respiratory diseases during the same period of time. Background: In tropical regions, there is a large proportion of the population which has been in contact with intestinal parasites, including the roundworm Ascaris spp. There are conflicting reports on the protective effect or harmful influence of sensitization to Ascaris spp. in patients with allergic respiratory diseases, such as allergic asthma. Objectives: to investigate specific IgE levels in children hospitalised with severe asthma in the tropical island of Martinique. Materials and Methods: From 2002 to 2005 we investigated specific IgE levels in the serum of children hospitalised for severe asthma in Fort de France, Martinique. As controls we used a group of 484 children (mean age 7.42) evaluated for allergic respiratory diseases at an outpatient clinic. Specific IgE to Ascaris spp. was measured by the CAP system (Phadia). Results: A total of 117 children (68 boys and 49 girls; mean age 6.45) were investigated. Mean number of hospitalisations and of days stayed in the hospital were 1.35 and 3.02 days, respectively. A total of 60 children (51.28%) had a positive determination (mean value 6.69 kU/L). The mean number of hospitalisation in the positive group was 1.28 and the mean days stayed at the hospital, 3.05 days. 47 children stayed 3 or more days in the hospital; in this group there 22 Ascaris spp. negative and 25 Ascaris spp. positive children (NS). In the negative group, the mean number of hospitalisation was 1.42 times and the mean days stayed at the hospital, 2.98 days. In the control group, 215 (44.42%) had a positive specific IgE determination to Ascaris spp. Conclusion: In contrast to what has been proposed for other tropical countries, sensitization to Ascaris spp. seems not to influence the severity of asthma in Martinique. Similar rates of sensitization to Ascaris spp. are detected in allergic children who do not require hospitalisation for their allergic asthma.",

As the most common chronic illness in children, childhood asthma causes school absences and limitations of children`s activities, making asthma especially serious for them. Methods: Standardized questionnaires were distributed randomly to 200 doctors in Surakarta, who are general physicians, general pediatricians and pediatric pulmonologist. Results: Of the 200 questionnaires, 78 were returned: 74 from general physicians and 3 from pediatricians. Most of the doctors never use score cards to monitor childhood asthma, never used spirometry and never used peak flow meters. For the treatment of acute asthma methylprednisolone was first choice in 83%, while 17 % used dexamethasone. For maintenance treatment of childhood asthma no physician used montelukast because this drug is not available in Surakarta. However, as a first choice maintenance treatment, most physicians used a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid in infants, preschoolers and older children. Conclusion: Striking results were the low usage of score cards, lung function testing in monitoring childhood asthma, and the high usage of a LABA in combination with inhaled corticosteroids as first choice maintenance treatment, suggesting that guidelines on asthma monitoring and treatment are not strictly followed in Surakarta.",

Some have associated reduced frequency and others increased frequency of infection with more allergic disease. We have employed a unique algorithm (Business EffiScience) to the analysis of a large database from early prevention of atopic asthma in children (EPAAC) trial. 510 infants between 1Y2 years of age with atopic eczema (SCORAD9 10) entered the study and 434 completed 18 months follow up. As there was no difference between active and placebo intervention all subjects were merged for the purposes of this analysis which were to establish which factors at recruitment either singly or in combination had the greatest impact on the subsequent development of asthma defined as greater than or equal to three episodes of wheezing and/or paroxysmal cough disturbing sleep for at least three consecutive nights. To analyze the impact of early infection on asthma we analysed the effect of the number of infections per year of infants from birth to asthma onset or end of the study when asthma was not observed. A bell shaped curve was identified with 27% infants less often developing asthma if they had 1.5 or less infections per year, 25% more often to have asthma with 1.5 to 4 infections per year and 11% less often to have asthma with more than 4 infections per year. The only other interaction was with proximity to a factory as a surrogate for pollution exposure which only increased the risk of asthma if there was a frequency of infections between two and five per year. Thus the combination of atopic eczema with raised IgE and proximity to a factory was associated with a 77% uplift in frequency of developing asthma if the frequency of infections was between 1.5 and 4 per year. The bell shaped curve of frequency of infection in relation to asthma risk may well explain the discrepant results in various studies. Very low frequency of infection occurs in infants with an effective TH1 response and therefore reduced probability of developing allergic disease while those with a very high frequency of infection have a greater probability of inducing TH1 responsiveness while normal rates of infection in an atopically predisposed individual will not modify the outcome.",

Peanut challenges are not warranted in patients with a definite history of peanut anaphylaxis with positive SPT. We recommend that where the history is suggestive but SPT is negative or borderline positive, i.e. e 5 mm, a peanut challenge is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Lysed Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (LFK) could suppress the allergic responses; however, the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains unclear. Objective: To evaluate the effect of LFK on intestinal microflora in antibiotic treated weaning mice. Methods: Three-week-old BALB/c mice were sensitized with cedar pollen allergen to establish an experimental model. Orally administered erythromycin, one kind of macrolide antibiotic, was used for the experiments. The intestinal microbiota, and the allergen-induced accumulation of eosinophils and IgE level in sera were determined in the control, antibiotic, LFK and antibiotic-LFK groups (n = 7, respectively). Results: The total aerobes, total anaerobes and Enterococcus of intestinal microflora were not significantly different among all groups. Lactobacillus was distinctly eliminated in the mice exposed to erythromycin on day 7 and totally recovered in erythromycin-treated mice with LFK intervention on day 28, but could not recovered in the erythromycin-treated mice without LFK intervention. Conclusion: LFK improved the intestinal ecosystem disturbed by antibiotic use, and may prevent subsequent development of allergy. Background: Mycobacterial tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.Infection with this bacteria is known to induce the development of autoantibodies and a few of these antibodies are also known to be diagnostic markers for some other diseases. ANCA`S are one of autoantibodies used in clinical setting for diagnosing systemic vasculitic syndrome . More than 20 studies investigating ANCA positivity in diseases other than small vessel vasculitis . This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of ANCA in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) which could lead to false diagnosis of wegner`s granulomatosis or vice versa. Materials and Methods: In a caseYcontrol study 32 consecutive smear positive pulmonary TB patients and 32 normal individuals were studied . All cases and controls screened for ANCA by indirect immunoflurecent (IIF) and also myeloperoxidase antibodies (anti-MPO) and proteinase 3 antibodies (anti-PR3) were tested by ELISA. Results: Perinuclear pattern (P-ANCA) was detected in 25% of cases and 6.25% of controls and cytoplasmic pattern(C-ANCA) in 3.1% of both cases and controls by IIF assay. ANCA specificities by ELISA in cases revealed that 75% had anti-myleperoxidase and 12.5% had anti-Proteinase 3. In controls 3.12% had anti-MPO and no person had anti Y PR3 .

Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are autoimmune diseases with respectively T cell mediated and B cell mediated mechanisms. Endotoxin (ET) from gram negative flora can rapidly induce or reactivate experimental arthritis, probably by stimulation of secretion of Th1 inflammatory cytokines. ET is a potent polyclonal Blymphocyte activator. This study investigates anti-endotoxin humoral immunity in patients with RA and SLE. Methods: 27 patients were studied including: Group I-18 patients with RA; and, Group II-9 patients with SLE. The age range was 30Y50 years. Disease duration was from 6 months to 10 years. Disease status based on clinical, including joint involvement, and laboratory data were less than or equal to class II degree of activity. Peripheral blood was obtained and serum analyzed.",

The levels of IgG anti-ET antibodies were not different from the healthy control group. Patients with SLE had levels of IgG anti-ET antibodies which were 2.2 fold greater (pG0.01) than normal controls. These same SLE patients had levels of IgA anti-ET and IgM anti-ET which were respectively 2.3 (pG0.001) and 2.1 (pG0.01) fold less than in the healthy control group. Reduced IgA anti-ET levels occurred in 56.7% (pG0.001) and reduced IgM anti-ET levels occurred in 53.6% (pG0.01) of SLE patients. Reduced IgA anti-ET levels occurred in 56.7% (pG0.001) and reduced IgM anti-ET levels occurred in 56% (pG0.001) of RA patients. Conclusion: Anti-ET IgG levels in RA patients demonstrate a normal level of response while in SLE patients greater than normal responses to ET occur Dysfunctional anti-ET immune responses occurred with respect to reduced IgM and IgA anti-ET antibodies in both SLE and RA patients. There may be a role for gut flora and immune responses to ET as factors modulating immune responses in RA and SLE patients.",

NK cells recognize antibody-coated target cells using CD16 (FcyRIIIA), and kill the target cells by the process called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Quantitative and qualitative defects in NK cell function result in susceptibility to intracellular microbes. Methods: Lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood were determined using flow cytometry. NK cell surface expression of CD56 and CD16 and the intracellular expression levels of perforin and granzyme B were analyzed by flow cytometry. Patient cDNA for CD16 was sequenced to screen for mutations within the coding region. Results: The patient is a 6 year-old girl who suffered from recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections. She had experienced two episodes of varicella despite receiving the vaccine, and, despite this, varicella antibody was negative. She also has numerous warts on her fingers. Immunologic studies revealed low serum immunoglobulins (IgG 413, IgA 38, and IgM 37 mg/dL at 42 years), but she had exuberant antibody production in response to pneumococcal vaccine. Peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotyping revealed slightly low T cell numbers for age with preservation of the CD4/CD8 ratio, B cells were normal in percentage and number. CD56+ NK cells were 6 % of the lymphocyte gate, but the expression of CD16+ was less than 1 % using Leu11c/B73.1. However, analysis of NK cells using a different antibody to CD16, NKP46/9E2, revealed normal CD16 surface expression. Sequencing of peripheral blood cDNA demonstrated a homozygous TA transversion at base pair 489 in the CD16 mRNA sequence producing a Leu to His substitution at residue 102 in the peptide sequence, a mutation previously described in a patient with recurrent orolabial HSV exacerbations and respiratory infections (Jawahar et al 1996, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 103:408 Background: Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune subepithelial blistering disorder, characterized by predominant involvement of the mucous membrane and occasionally the skin, chronic course, and tendency towards scarring of the affected areas. Most common sites of involvement are oral mucosa and conjunctivae. In our hospital, this is the second case of CP, and the first case with skin involvement for the last five years. Case: A 72 years old male had undergone dysphagia and blistering disorder in the skin for six month. Clinical manifestation were erythematous and erosions in oral mucous, tongue, and crust in lips. Skin lesions were tense hemorrhagic blisters with negative Nikolsky sign, erosions and crust in chest, axilae, abdomen and left lower arm. Few slight atrophic scars were also found. Pharyngoscopy showed erythematous and brittle of the pharynx, soft palate and tongue. The histopathology examination showed subepidermal bullae, epidermal atrophy, sparse perivascular and periappendageal inflammatory infiltrates consisted of mostly lymphocytes with few polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils and fibrosis in the dermis. The patient favorably responded to oral steroid, prednisone 45 mg daily in combination with dapsone 100 mg daily, and improved after seven weeks. Discussion: CP is a rare autoimmune subephitelial blistering disorder, characterized by predominant involvement of the mucous membrane. According to the literature, skin involvement in CP occurs in about onefourth of cases. Diagnosis in this case was suggested by the presence of scarring lesions in pharyngeal mucous membrane with dysphagia, slight atrophic scar in the skin and confirm by histopathology. Prednisone and dapsone are used due to severe disease and to prevent potential severe complication. Conclusion: CP with skin involvement is uncommon. Diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and, confirmed by histopathology. Therapy with prednisone and dapsone shows good result in CP. Introduction: IgA deficiency (IgAD) is the most common immunoglobulin deficiency and one of the most frequent primary immunodeficiencies. The prevalence of IgAD in Icelandic blood donors has recently been estimated to be 1:570. Correlations between having IgAD and various autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), have been rapported. Materials and Methods: IgA was measured in serum from 319 patients with thyrotoxicosis and 199 patients with DM TI. In comparison IgA levels from 609 blood donors was evaluated. IgA was measured with Beckman Array 360 System Nephelometry. IgA levels were also studied in relation to titers of TSH Receptor Antibodies (TRAb) and Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (anti TPO). TRAb was measured with ELISA and anti TPO was measured using FEIA. Results: None of the 319 thyrotoxicosis patients had IgAD (IgA in serum G 0,05 g/L). Women with thyrotoxicosis had significantly lower levels of serum IgA compared to men with thyrotoxicosis ([IgA] male = 2,67 T 1,16 g/L vs.",

IgA levels increased significantly with age in patients with thyrotoxicosis (PG0,01) and a similar correlation was found in the blood donor group. A negative correlation was found between levels of IgA in serum and TRAb (correlation coefficient=j0.322, P = 0,0455) and also between levels of IgA and antiTPO (correlation coefficient=j0,376, P = 0,0204). One individual with DM TI had hypogammaglobulinemia, but none had selective IgAD in that cohort. Interestingly, men with DM TI had lower serum IgA than women. Conclusion: These results are a strong indication that the prevalence of IgAD is not increased amont patients with thyrotoxicosis or DM TI in Iceland. The negative correlation between IgA levels and thyroid autoantibodies suggests a possible role of IgA in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases. IgA might have a protective role in the formation of autoantibodies against thyroid structures or a mutual autoimmune mechanism might cause brake-down of IgA and the formation of thyroid autoantibodies.",

It has been thought that Th2 response play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma. However, recently, there have been reported that Th1 response also play a important role in pathogenesis of asthma. In Th1 immune response, IL-12 and STAT4 are key molecules. IL-12 play a important role in Th1 development, and promotion of Th1 responses and the production of interferon-gamma. And STAT4 are believed that it also play a important role in Th1 immune rsponse. But it still remains unclear whether these molecules play key roles in asthma development in vivo. Methods: To evaluate the roles of IL-12 and STAT-4 in murine model of asthma, 6-week-old IL-12 receptor $2 (j/j), STAT4 (j/j) null mutant, and their littermate wild type control mice were used, respectively. The mice were sensitized four times with 756g of OVA at days 0, 1, 2, and 7 in the presence or absence of 106g of LPS, and then challenged 4 times intranasally with 506g of OVA at days 14, 15, 21, and 22. STAT4 (j/j) and wild type control mice were sensitized and the challenged in the same manner. After challenging, we tested the airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) against methacholine challenge. The mice were sacrificed 48 hours after last allergen challeng, and various immunological parameters were evaluated such as BAL fluids cellularity. Results: Total cell number of BAL fluids was increased in the mice sensitized with LPS and OVA compared with mice sensitized with OVA only. BAL fluids flammatory cells were similar between IL-12 receptor l$2 knock-out mice and wild type mice, but significantly decreased in STAT4 null mutant mice. Interestingly, IP-10 level in BAL fluids was partially decreased in IL-12 (j/j) mice, but markedly decreased in STAT4 (j/j) mice. Conclusion: In Th1 experimental asthma, airway inflammatory responses are partially dependent on IL-12, but dependent on STAT4 signaling pathway.",

However, the pathogenesis of this unwanted response has not well determined. Toll-like receptors have been shown to play a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Recently, many research groups have hypothesized that these TLRs are likely to play important roles in asthma pathogenesis, but, most studies are focused on the effect of TLR polymorphism. Therefore, we investigated whether the expressions of several TLRs are different in asthma patients compared to normal subjects and if so, whether the functionality of these receptors could be related to this change. Methods: The expressions of TLR2, 4, and TLR6 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asthma patients and normal subjects were analyzed by flow cytometry. To study the functional responses of these receptors, PBMCs were stimulated with PGN and Pam3Cys as TLR2 ligands, LPS as a TLR4 ligand or FSL-1 as a TLR2/6 ligand for 24 hours and the amounts of TNF-\" and IL-1$ were determined by ELISA. Results: The expression of TLR2 was up-regulated on PBMCs from asthma patient as compared to normal subject. Upon stimulation with PGN or Pam3Cys, TNF-\" and IL-1$ production significantly increased in asthma patients. In contrast, the response to LPS (TLR4 ligand) stimulation on PBMCs was higher in normal subject than asthma patients, although the expression of TLR4 was not significantly different between asthma patients and normal subject. In case of TLR6, surface expression was significantly reduced in asthma patients. However, no difference was observed in the amounts of TNF-\" and IL-1$secreted from PBMCs treated with FSL-1. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the difference of the phonotypical expression and the functional responsiveness of TLRs might be related with pathogenesis of asthma.",

Methods: Mice were subjected either to repeated, intranasal application of Af extract or to intraperitoneal immunization with OVA, followed by inhalation challenge. Omalizumab or a control fluid was given daily throughout the sensitization process. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, bronchoalveolar lavage-fluid cytokines and cytology, lung histology, and physiologic responses to methacholine were assessed in the allergen-treated mice. Anti-OVA IgE responses and OVA-driven T-cell cytokine production were examined. Results: Treatment with omalizumab did inhibit bronchial inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in both Af-and OVA-treated mice. This inhibition required that omalizumab be administered concurrently with allergen sensitization, indicating that the attenuation of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and inflammation was not caused by anticholinergic receptor effects. OVA-responsive T cells from omalizumab-treated mice exhibited depressed production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and normal amounts of interferon-gamma. The amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 were also diminished in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Conclusion: Omalizumab, given at the time of exposure to the allergen, inhibits the induction of allergic pulmonary inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. These results suggest that omalizumab or similar agents given during times of antigen exposure might alter disease progression in patients with respiratory allergy.",

            "text": "Background: House dust mites (HDM) belong to the most common sources of airborne allergens worldwide and sensitization to them is strongly associated with development of allergic airway diseases. Many proteolytic HDM allergens can activate respiratory epithelial cells to produce proinflammatory mediators. In contrast there is limited knowledge regarding potential similar effects of non-proteolytic allergens, although they include many major allergens. One of them is Der p 2 of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. To investigate whether Der p 2 activate respiratory epithelial cells to produce mediators involved in pathogenesis of allergic asthma and to elucidate the mechanism of such activation, we exposed the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B to this allergen. Methods: Bronchial BEAS-2B cells were exposed to recombinant Der p 2 (1-80 6g/ml). After 2-24 hours the mRNA levels and the secreted amount of soluble mediators as well as the expression of cell adhesion receptors involved in recruitment, survival and binding of inflammatory cells, for instance GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-3\" and ICAM-1, were analyzed. After exposure the adhesion of leukocyte cells U937 to the epithelial cells was also studied. In order to study if the activation was dependent on signalling through NF-0B and the MAP kinases ERK1/2, p38 or JNK specific inhibitors were used. Results: Der p 2 induced dose-dependent up-regulation in gene expression and protein secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and MIP-3\". Expression of ICAM-1 was also up-regulated, which was associated with a subsequent increased adhesion of leukocytes to the epithelial cells. These responses were partly dependent on NF-0B and MAPK activation, since the specific inhibitors reduced the activation. Conclusion: Taken together these results imply that Der p 2 may potentiate asthmatic responses in airways by direct activation of lung epithelial cells in a protease-independent manner. Human eosinophils play important roles in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases, specifically asthma. Interleukin 6, IL-8 (CXCL8), and Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2) play a pivotal role in mediating the infiltration and activation of immune cells into pathogenic lesions, including the lung and skin. The aim of this study was to examine whether the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronissinus extract (DpE) affects the mRNA and protein expression of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 in the human eosinophil cell line, EoL-1 by performing RT-PCR and ELISA. DpE increased the mRNA and protein expression of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 in EoL-1 cells. The increased expression of MCP-1 and IL-8 was inhibited by PP2, an inhibitor of Src, rottlerin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C & (PKC&), and PD98059, an upstream inhibitor of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). It indicates that DpE increases MCP-1 and IL-8 expression through Src, PKC & and ERK. We also found that IL-6 expression due to DpE was related to Src, PKC &, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In early signal pathway, the expressions of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 are regulated by Src family tyrosine kinase and PKC & pathway activated by DpE. This finding may contribute to the elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism triggered by DpE.",

Background: Blomia tropicalis (Bt), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) and D. farinae (Df) are the prevalent house dust mites (HDMs). Concanavalin A-binding components derived from B. tropicalis (Bt-ConA extract) have shown to be highly immunogenic in allergic diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune responses to B. tropicalis in sensitized patients. Methods: A total of 137 patients with allergic rhinitis with/without asthma and 109 non-atopic subjects were selected and analyzed for skin reactivity (SPT), total serum IgE and specific IgE levels to both Bt-total and Bt-ConA extracts, proliferative response and cytokine (IFN-+ and IL-5) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with both extracts. Results: SPT showed that 70% of patients were sensitized to Bt (Bt+) and no patient was monosensitized to Bt. Similar levels of specific IgE to Bt-total and Bt-ConA extracts were found in Bt+patients, while higher levels of total serum IgE were found in atopic than non-atopic subjects. Significant PBMC proliferation was observed in response to Bt-total extract in Bt-sensitized, but not in Bt-non-sensitized patients and non-atopic subjects, while Bt-ConA extract was able to induce increased proliferative responses in all patient groups. Significant IFN-+ production was observed only after Bt-ConA stimulation in Bt+patients, while Bt-total extract showed no changes. IL-5 production was consistently seen in Bt+patients after allergen-specific stimulation or even with no stimulus. Conclusion: We can conclude that Bt-ConA extract may contain relevant antigens that are involved in both humoral and cellular immune responses, with potential use in diagnostic procedures.",

Background and Purpose: Eosinophils are well accepted to be the most important cells in the development and maintenance of the clinical conditions of allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. It is also accepted that nasal mucosal epithelial cells secrete several types of cytokines and chemokines, which affect eosinophil accumulation into the site of the disease and cell survival. However, the influence of second-generation antihistamines, which are used for the treatment and prevention of allergic diseases are not well understood. The present study, therefore, was undertaken to evaluate the influence of epinastine hydrochloride (EP), the most famous secondgeneration of antihistamine in Japan, on cytokine secretion and eosinophil survival. Materials and Methods: Epithelial cells from nasal polyps were stimulated with 25 ng/ml TNF-! with or without EP for 24 h. Cytokine levels in culture supernatants were examined by ELISA. Human peripheral blood eosinophils were cultured with epithelial cell conditioned medium (CM) and EP. Eosinophil survival was assessed by Trypan blue dye exclusion test. Results are expressed as the mean SE of cytokine concentrations (pg/ml) and eosinophil survival index (%). Results: Addition of EP into cell cultures dose-dependently inhibited the ability of cells to produce granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-8, which are increased by TNF-! stimulation. EP also could inhibit eosinophil survival induced by CM and the minimum concentration of EP that caused significant suppression of the survival was 20.0 ng/ml. Conclusion: The inhibitory effect of EP on inflammatory cytokine production from epithelial cells and on eosinophil survival contributed to its therapeutic effect on allergic airway diseases, including allergic rhinitis.",

Background: H1 receptor antagonists, so called antihistamine, are accepted to have anti-angiogenesis properties in addition to being H1 antagonists. Epinastine hydrochloride (EP) is the most famous H1 receptor antagonists in Japan and used for treatment of allergic upper airway inflammatory diseases such as pollinosis with remarkably success. However, the influence of EP on pro-angiogenesis factor production is not well understood. In the present study, therefore, we investigate the influence of EP on the production of angiogenesis factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) from murine mast cells in vitro. Materials and Methods: Murine mast cells were stimulated with ovalbumin in the presence of various doses of EP for 24 h. The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-! levels in culture supernatants were examined by ELISA. mRNA expressions of these factors were also examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR in 4 h-cultured mast cells. Results: EP could suppress the production of VEGF, KC and TNF-! induced by an IgE dependent-mechanisms in dose-dependent manner. The minimum concentration of the agent that caused significant suppression was 45ng/ml. EP also suppressed mRNA expression examined when the agent was added to cell cultures at a dose of 45 ng/ml. Conclusion: These findings strongly suggest that anti-angiogenesis activity of EP may confer the attenuating effect of the agent on allergic diseases, including allergic pollinosis.",

MoDCs generated from peripheral blood and taken at day 7 of differentiation were incubated with various concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled recombinant Bet v 1a, Bet v 1d, and Bet v 1mut for 10 to 120 minutes at 37-C and studied by means of flow cytometry. Mechanisms of antigen internalization were investigated by the same experimental setup in the presence of inhibitors of pinocytosis, endocytosis, and receptor internalization. Results: FITC-labeled proteins were taken up by MoDCs in a dose-and time dependent manner. The percentage of FITC positive cells increased from 1 to 5 2g/ml of labeled proteins whereas the cells internalized most proteins between 10 and 30 minutes. At the lowest concentration of 1 2g/ml, the uptake of Bet v 1a was lower compared to the uptakes of Bet v 1d and Bet v 1mut in DCs of both study groups. This fact did not change for healthy individuals when higher concentrations of proteins were used whereas in allergic individuals Bet v 1a uptake at higher concentrations was similar to that of the two other isoforms. Inhibition of the uptake was generally lower using DCs from allergic compared to those of healthy individuals. Conclusion: All different agents showed inhibitions indicating that the uptake of Bet v 1 isoforms is not only mediated via one pathway but an interplay of mechanisms like receptor-mediated internalization, endocytic processing and macropinocytosis. Our observations implicate that different mechanisms are involved in Bet v 1a uptake in allergic individuals possibly leading to the induction of signals for Th2 polarization.

We investigated whether particular HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms contribute to the development of AD and EW sensitization in Korean children with AD. Methods: A total of 185 patients with AD and 109 normal controls (NC) with no personal and family history of allergy were included. HLA-DRB1 typing was done using PCR-SSO (sequence specific oligonucleotide) and PCR-SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) methods. Phenotype frequencies of the HLA-DRB1 alleles of AD patients were compared with those of NC. AD patients with allergy to EW was defined as group A (96 patients) whose EW specific IgE was over 2 kU/L in less than 2 year old age and over 7 kU/L in greater than 2 year old age. Group B (89 patients) was defined that EW specific IgE was negative among AD patients. Phenotype frequencies of the HLA-DRB1 alleles in group A and group B were compared with those of NC. HLA-DRB1 alleles were classified into functional groups (A, De, Dr, E, Q, R, a) and frequencies of HLA-DRB1 functional groups in group A and group B were compared with those of NC. Results: HLA-DRB1*1101 was present at significantly higher frequency in AD patients compared with NC (12.4% vs 1.8%, P=0.002, OR=7.796, CI 1.775Y32.883) and was regarded as a factor associated with AD susceptibility. The result was significant after Bonferroni correction (Pc=0.048). The frequency of HLA-DRB1*0803 (10.8% vs 19.3%, P=0.043) was decreased in AD compared with NC, showing a weak protective effect against the development of AD. HLA-DRB1*0802 was decreased in group A compared with group B (2.1% vs 10.1%, P=0.021) and was regarded as a weak protective factor against the development of egg allergy in AD. HLA-DRB1*1501 was increased in group A compared with group B (22.9% vs 11.2%, P=0.036) and was regarded as a weak susceptibility factor associated with the development of egg allergy in AD. HLA-DRB1 functional group \"a\", in which DRB1*1501 is included, was also weakly associated with the development of egg allergy in AD. However, none of theses results remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Conclusion: There was a significant association between HLA-DRB1*1101 and AD. Weak association between HLA-DRB1*1501 with susceptibility to and HLA-DRB1*0802 with protection against the development of EW allergy in AD were observed.",

Methods: The investigations were performed on 60 children since 6 month to 5 years old: 20 children with CMA IgE dependent, 20 with CMA IgE independent and 20 healthy children. IgE total, sIgE, IgG, IgA, IgM, basic immunological panel, CD 23, CD25, CD26, CD30, CD69, PCNA were measured. Results: We noticed decrease of expression of CD4+CD30+between I and II examine (p=0,029), between I and III (p=0,009); decrease of expression of CD8+CD26+between I and III test (p=0,038); decrease of expression of CD19+CD23+between I and II examine (p=0,012) in I type of hypersensitivity. We observed decrease of expression of CD4+CD25+between I and III examine (p=0,026) and decrease of expression of CD4+CD26+between I and III examine (p=0,036) in IV type of hypersensitivity. Expression of CD69 was decreased after diet in allergy IgE dependent. Values of expression of PCNA are similar in I and IV type of hypersensitivity in children with CMA. Decrease of expression of PCNA in II examine was observed in both cases. Allergen reintroduced caused increase of expression of PCNA in both types of allergy (p=0,048 and p=0,041). Conclusion: Our recent research confirm changes of the expression of T lymphocytes activation markers. It is connected with in vivo stimulation to allergen or with allergen elimination. The study of expression of activation markers using flow cytometry in food allergy in children can be helpful in observation of the dynamic progress process, but it cannot be used as a single diagnosis test. Background: Probiotics are defined as live non-pathogenic microorganisms that beneficially affect the host. It has been suggested that administration of probiotics may have therapeutic and/or preventive benefits by improving the Th1 responses in atopic dermatitis (AD). Aim: We investigated the possibilities that skin can be used as a target for the prevention of AD and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, one of the most commonly used in the therapeutic intestinal probiotics, can induce the Th1 responses through keratinocytes. Methods: Keratinocytes were treated by L. rhamnosus for 2 hours and then cultured with new media for 24 hours. The supernatant (KCM) of L. rhamnosus-treated keratinocytes were collected and used for the maturation of immature dendritic cells from 5 normal and 5 AD individuals. CD14+ cells and naive T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of normal and AD individuals using isolation kits. CD14+cells were differentiated to immature dendritic cells (iDCs) with GM-CSF (200 ng/ml) and IL-4 (20 ng/ ml) for 6Y7 day. The iDCs were activated by KCM or LPS lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (positive control) for 48 hours and cocultured with naive T cells for 7 days. Results: We could confirm the maturation of iDCs by KCM and LPS through morphological changes and the expression of mature DC specific markers (CD80, CD83, and CD86) in normal and AD individuals. ELISA analysis showed that the mature DCs activated by KCM could induce the Th1 reponses. So, the IFN-+ was significantly increased in the co-cultured supernatants of mature DC and naive T cells, but IL-4 level was almost based. Furthemore, we found that IL-8 and HBD-3 were highly increased in keratinocytes after L. rhamnosus treatment. Conclusion: Probiotics, L. rhamnosus, can improve the Th1 responses through keratinocytes. The effects of probiotics will be mediated by IL-8 and/ or HBD-2 secreted by keratinocytes. However, there is no difference for the effects of probiotics between normal and AD individuals.",

            "text": "Interaction of aeroallergens with the respiratory interphase: degradation, processing and transmission via the epithelial barrier Research Center Borstel, Biological Chemistry, Borstel, Germany. Background: Antigen presenting cells are considered as the most important immune cells giving rise to allergy or tolerance development. But APCs are already embedded in a cytokine milieu, which in part predicts the immune response. Epithelial cells form a barrier to the environment and they are activated upon contact with molecules e.g. allergens. Therefore, they might play a pivotal role in the sensitization process. We studied the fate of the major grass pollen allergen Phl p 1 and its molecular modifications after contact with the respiratory interface. Methods: The influence of mucosal secretions (nasal secretion, bronchial lavage fluid) was investigated by immunoblotting and zymography and the uptake and transmission of the allergens by epithelial cells (cell lines and nasal and lung biopsies) were studied by FACS analysis, determination of cytokine release and immunohistology. Results: Nasal secretions of individuals suffering from bronchial inflammations or allergy to aeroallergens showed proteolytic activity. Experiments using supernatants from mast cells or neutrophils, similar to acute inflammation, resulted in a partial cleavage of the allergens. To investigate the allergen uptake two epithelial cell lines were used mimicing different sections of the lung, A549 (derived from alveolar pneumocytes) and Calu-3 (from the upper respiratory epithelium). Both cell lines were activated by Phl p 1 as demonstrated by the release of IL-8 and IL-6. Calu-3 cells in contrast to A549 cells expressed MHCII, a prerequisite for antigen processing and presentation. A549 cells, on the other hand, take up allergens by macropinocytosis and probably perform transcytosis. First results of human lung slices incubated with Phl p 1 showed only a faint allergen uptake, while macrophages in the alveolar space showed a considerable uptake. Whether macrophages after allergen uptake enter the interstitium again and/or whether the epithelial cells transfer allergens or fragments to professional APCs in the interstitium is still under investigation. Conclusion: The secretions of the respiratory tract cause a more or less incomplete fragmentation of allergens which may facilitate the allergen uptake by epithelial cells. Our results reveal differences in the uptake and transmission of allergens in the upper and lower airways. While the epithelial cells of the upper part probably degrade and process the allergens, cells of the lower part seem to transmit the unprocessed allergens. The estimation of influence of various programs of therapy on system and local level IL-6 and SR-IL-6 was made at development atopic march of teenager patients. The research allowed to reveal, that therapy with the help of topical steroids practically did not influence SR-IL-6 level in serum of blood (22,72T0,25ng/ml), but led to decrease in IL-6 level at patients with BA (0,17T0,001 pg/ml) and combination B\u00c0 and \u00c0 R (3,59T0,37 pg/ml). At combination of B\u00c0 and \u00c0 R the simultaneous decrease of IL-6 and SR-IL-6 was established while using topical steroids. On the contrary, having clinical B\u00c0 and AD evidence steroid therapy led to one-stage increase cytokine (6,45T0,41pg/ml), and level of receptor to it (31,76T0,15ng/ml). Thus, research of nasal lavage can be offered as nonivasive method for the control of efficiency of therapy of patients having combination B\u00c0 and \u00c0 R while using topical steroids. Therapy with topical steroids of patients with B\u00c0 and with combination B\u00c0 with \u00c0 R and \u00c0 R with AD provided decrease of IL-6 level and did not lead to change of SR-IL-6 level in serum of blood. Therapy with topical steroids did not lead to decrease in content of IL-6 both in serum and in nasal secret only in group of patients with combination B\u00c0 and AD. Previous work in type-I pollen allergies has focused on lymphocytes and immune responses. Here we begin to analyse with a systems biology top-down view the differences in nasal epithelium obtained from healthy and allergic subjects. Light and immunoelectron microscopic analysis showed that birch pollen Bet v 1 allergen bound to epithelial cell surfaces within minutes even during non-symptomatic winter seasons only in allergic, but not healthy individuals. Bet v 1 also travelled through epithelium together with lipid rafts/caveolae and reached mast cells only in allergic, but not healthy individuals within minutes. A putative viral entry protein E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and three enzymes involved in lipid rafts/caveolae metabolism were among the few Bet v 1 binding proteins found in allergic subjects with affinity chromatography and LC-MS2. Nasal epithelial cell transcriptomics during non-symptomatic winter season identified a list of putative receptors by which Bet v 1 might be recognized. It also suggested that defence mechanisms (such as expression of histatins) could be impaired in allergic patients. Comparing nasal epithelial transcriptomics taken in winter and during symptomatic summer seasons provided hints to the cellular perturbations enabling the Bet v1 traffic through nasal epithelial cells and tissues. Thus application of discovery and hypothesis driven methodologies on human nasal epithelial tissue could provide new hypothesis worth further analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms.",

Critically involved in tolerance transfer is allergenspecific IgG that was increased during pregnancy in the tolerized mouse, fetus and newborn. FcRn j/j mice, that cannot transport IgG via the placenta, transferred tolerance to the offspring only when the missing diaplacental IgG transfer was compensated by IgG transfer via breast milk from tolerant dams but not when the offspring was crossfostered by naBve mice. Inhibition of IFN-+, produced by memory B cells in the offspring, abrogated the protective effect of maternal tolerance demonstrating its crucial memory role in materno-fetal tolerance transfer. Our data show that maternal immunologic memory has significant and persistent impact on the immune response of the offspring indicating that e.g. allergy prevention strategies might be effective for more than one generation.",

Objective: The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of a Meditation program on Complete Blood Cell count(CBC), IgG and C3 as a marker of specific and nonspecific humoral immunity. Methods: 78 subjects, aged 18Y56 years, of whom 62 were male and 20 female undergoing a period of one month Meditation, were excluded. They were all experiencing meditation for the first time. Before starting the meditation training, all of these volunteers have been visited by a physician and only healthy subjects(78 subjects), not taking any type of drug and with regular life habits were chosen to be at this clinical trial. Blood samples were taken from all subjects, the day before the study commenced, and again one month later, at the end of the study. The blood parameters investigated included the number of Leukocytes(total Leukocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Lymphocytes),Red cell count(RBC), Hemoglobin(Hb), Hematocrit(Hct), Mean cell volume (MCV), Mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), Mean cell hemoglobin concentration(MCHC), Red cell distribution width (RDW),Platelet count, as well as the concentrations of immunoglobulins(IgG) and complement(C3). 4 of these volunteers has been excluded from research plan because of their sickness during the period. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between first and second blood samples of volunteers showing lower numbers of total Leukocytes(P=0.02) and Eosinophils(P=0.01),number and percentage of Monocytes(P=0.01),as well as complement C3 concentration(P=0.004). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that one month of practicing Meditation, can decrease some immunological parameters.

Vedanthan 3 . 1 JSS Medical College, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Mysore, India; 2 Allergy Asthma and Chest Center, Department of Allergy, Mysore, India; 3 University of Colorado Health Sciences, Department of Allergy, Colorado, United States. Background: The possibility for secondary prevention of asthma was highlighted by the prevention of asthma study, which demonstrated that immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis, could prevent asthma in some patients. The feasibility of secondary prevention of asthma and the proportion of patients likely to be benefited need to be demonstrated as immunotherapy requires time to exert its beneficial effects. Methodology: All the patients who underwent a detailed evaluation including allergy testing during the period 2003 to 2006 were included in the study. A structured questionnaire was applied to collect data on demography, a detailed clinical history, the duration of asthma and allergic rhinitis and the proportion of patients whose rhinitis preceded asthma and the time interval between the development of rhinitis and asthma. Results: A total of 934 cases were included in the study. 701 (75%) patients had allergic rhinitis for varying intervals before they developed asthma. 143(15.5%) patients continued to have rhinitis for more than 5 years without developing asthma. 57(6%) patients had only asthma without rhinitis. 33(3.5%) patients developed asthma before they developed rhinitis. 327 (46.6%) developed asthma within 1 year of developing rhinitis. Of these, 164 developed asthma within 6 months and 169 between 6Y12 months. 374 patients developed asthma more than a year after the onset of rhinitis and the frequency gradually decreased with increase in duration of rhinitis. Conclusion: Majority of patients had rhinitis before they developed asthma. Nearly 50% of these patients with preceding rhinitis developed asthma within one year, who may not be amenable for secondary prevention with immunotherapy due to the delays in referral to the allergist and the time required for obtaining the necessary benefit from immunotherapy. Patients who develop asthma alone or develop rhinitis after the onset of asthma are not candidates for secondary prevention. Of the total cases studied, less than 40% can undergo interventions targeted towards secondary prevention of asthma. Intense education of the Family physicians and ENT specialists is needed to ensure prompt referral to the allergist to help these patients. Aim: to assess the relationship between ACT and different markers of airway inflammation in asthmatic subjects Methods: In a crossover design, we studied 106 patient suffering from mild or moderate asthma (median age 31years IQR 16Y45) ). Fifty five percent were only treated with short beta agonist on demand. On the same visit patients fullfiled the ACT questionnaire, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) (NiOx Mini) was measured and bronchial challenge with hypertonic saline and sputum induction were performed. Results: On the whole sample ACT was modestly correlated with eNO (r= j0,40, pG 0,001), eosinophils in induced sputum (r=j0,30, pG 0,05) and the slope of hypertonic saline bronchial challenge (r= 0,43, pG 0,001). Patients with very good control (ACT 24 0r 25) had significantly lower levels of eNO (41 vs 72 ppb, pG0,001) and eosinophils (10 vs 6%, pG 0,05). Correlations of all these variables improved, when only the 55 patients treated with beta agonist on demand were included: eNO (r=j0,55, pG 0,0001), eosinophils in induced sputum, (r=j0,50, p= 0,002), and slope of hypertonic saline bronchial challenge (r= 0,52, pG 0,0001.

Clinic of Pulmology and Allergy, Asthma Department, Skopje, Macedonia, Fyrom. Background: Education of the patients is one of the first goals of asthma management in all the international treatment protocols. We made this study in order to estimate the need and the effect of an educational program prepared by the Macedonian Asthma Center. Methods: We studied 300 asthmatics. We prepared a pilot educational course, covering the most important and ''hot'' subjects concerning asthma, following the guidelines from the Global strategy for asthma management and prevention. (May 1996) , and a questionnaire with 10 questions treating the problems concerning the treatment problems in asthma management. The questions were grouped in 2 parts : I -general knowledge of asthma medications and the necessity of adequate and continuous anti-inflammatory treatment; and II -accent on the emergency interventions and actions during acute exacerbations. The questionnaire was completed by all of the patients, before and after attending the educational course. Results: Before visiting the course, only 46.3% answered correctly the questionnaire (39.9% correct answers on part I and 52.8% on part II). These results imply that more than 50%of the tested asthmatic population do not realize the need for preventive medication or would in fact take the wrong medication during worsening of their disease. After visiting the educational course the results are as follows: 54.8% overall correct answers (nonsignificant-NS). The results from part I showed that only 52.4% (NS) of the patients gave correct answers and 73.6% (significant) answered the II part correctly. Conclusion: We conclude that patients more willingly accept advice on emergency self management of acute asthma exacerbations, but it is the most difficult to overcome the ''fear of preventive treatment'' and to change the dogmatic opinion on the therapeutic issues of asthma management. The study shows the necessity of organizing further and continuous asthma educational programs on all levels of the health care.",

Background: Recently, the number of patients requiring hospitalization because of an asthma attack has decreased; however, there are still patients who require hospitalization for tracheal intubation and respirator management for a severe asthma attack. Therefore, we evaluated the background features of 20 asthmatic patients who required tracheal intubation and respirator management in our hospital. Methods: We evaluated 20 asthmatic patients who visited our hospital from January 2001 to December 2005 and required tracheal intubation and respirator management. All the patients had severely exacerbated asthma, as determined on the basis of the guideline of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2006, and they required tracheal intubation and respirator management. We evaluated their history of smoking, the days from asthma attack onset to their visit to our hospital, the level of asthma control as determined from the GINA 2006 guideline, treatments taken before the patients visited our hospital, their frequency of visiting a hospital, the reason for tracheal intubation and respirator management based on the Asthma Prevention and Management Japanese Guideline 2006, and their prognosis. Results: The patients who required tracheal intubation and respirator management were the following: 1. smokers, 2. patients not taking or irregularly taking treatment, 3. patients who used inhaled short-acting \"2 agonist only at the time of an asthma attack, and 4. patients not using inhaled glucocorticosteroids. The reasons for tracheal intubation and respirator management were as follows: PaO2 of less than 50mmHg despite maximum oxygen administration in 30% of the patients; sudden increase in PaCO2 leading to unconsciousness in 20%; both PaO2 of less than 50mmHg despite maximum oxygen administration and sudden increase in PaCO2 leading to unconsciousness in 25%; and severe ventilatory or cardiorespiratory disturbance in 25%. Conclusion: We observed that a thorough education of patients and treatment mainly using inhaled glucocorticosteroids are important for preventing a severe asthma attack that requires tracheal intubation and respirator management.",

Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. Background: Interest in the impact of illness on day to day function is leading investigators to include both disease specific and generic health related quality of life (HR QOL) questionnaires in a broad range of clinical studies and to gain a full picture of the impact of asthma on the lives of caregivers of asthmatic children, it is necessary to make direct measurement of health related quality of life. Methods: In response to this need, we used Juniper_s Pediatric Asthma Caregiver_s Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) that has been developed based on guidelines for construction of over a dozen validated disease specific quality of life instruments.The PACQLQ that contains 13 items in two domains of emotional and activities disturbances. The study design consisted of an 18 month single cohort study. Patients participating in the study were 113 children, 7Y17 years of age, with a wide range of asthma severity and their caregivers. For each caregiver a PACQLQ was completed. One week before visit patients recorded morning peak flow rates, medication use and symptoms in a diary. After complete physical examination, for determining of asthma severity, spirometry was performed. Results: The questionnaires after statically analysis showed good levels of both longitudinal and cross sectional correlations with the conventional asthma indices and with general quality of life. Conclusion: We found a good relevancy between severity of asthma and QOL scores and more disturbances of QOL in caregivers of male asthmatic patients than caregivers of female asthmatic patients. Bronchial asthma as a chronic and devastating disease can affect not only life style of the patients but also their caregivers. Increment of our knowledge about these disturbances can help the physicians for better understanding of burdens of their patients.",

Institute of Internal Diseases, Republican Allergological Center, Almaty, Kazakhstan. Background: Treatment of a bronchial asthma (BA) is often conducted without an allowance of a concomitant allergic rhinitis (AR), which can be a reason of unsuccessful results in an achievement of a maximized therapeutic effect. Research about an interaction between BA and AR is conducted in the republican allergic center of scientific research institute of cardiology and internal diseases under Ministry of Public Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Aim: To determine the degree of influence of allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tracts on ventilating capability of lungs in patients with bronchial asthma. Materials and Methods: The thirty patients with severe BA and concomitant the AR were prescribed to intranasal mometazon spray in a dose of 100 microgram two times a day for a one month. This treatment followed after two weeks course of standard hospital therapy that includes steroids (intravenous, inhalation), b2-\u00e0gonists, etc. The age of the patients was ranged from 25 to 50 years old. Therapy effectiveness was controlled both by clinical and by laboratorial methods: spirography and daily pickflowmetry, determination of the resistance of a bronchial tree, rhinomanometry and identification of ECP. Results: All patients at the end of the first month of treatment mentioned the stable improvement of nasal breathing and sleep recovery. Also, a valid reduction of the resistance of nasal apertures was discovered (pG0.005). The majority of the patients (93.3%) have the improvement of clinical picture of the BA, which confined in less amount of asthma attacks and also improvement of the functional and laboratorial measures: PEF growth, decrease of its variability (pG0.05), reduction in the resistance of the bronhial tree (pG0.05) and normalization of ECP. Conclusion: Conducted research proved a valid increase in the effectiveness of supporting therapy of the BA with the combination of active treatment of the AR, which becomes apparent besides clinical improvement in an additional growth of measures of ventilating capability of lungs, level of the resistance of the bronchial tree and nasal apertures and normalization of ECP content.",

Methods: A standardized questionnaire survey, which was construced by APAPARI on monitoring and treating childhood asthma was send to physicians in 25 provinces and cities of China. Results: 1863 questionnaires were received, of which 912 were completed (48.95%) 57% of the doctors were general pediatricians, 20% were pediatric pulmonologists or pediatric allergists, 9% were adult pulmonologists or allergists who also treatment children, and 14% were others (non-specified). Working places were: 71% in a tertiary hospital, 23% in a secondary hospital, and 4% work in a first grade hospital.Most of the doctors (66%) used peak flow meter or spirometry to monitor childhood asthma, while 31% of them used diary cards. For treating acute asthma exacerbations, the first choice treatment was nebulized salbutamol/terbutaline every 20 mins (29%), the second choice was salbutamol inhalation with a spacer (22%) and the third choice was systemic corticosteroids (12%). Pediatric pulmonologists and pulmonologists tended to use ICS for acute asthma. The most frequently used systemic corticosteroids for acute asthma treatment were dexamethasone (86%), methylprednisolone (83%) and hydrocortisone (81%). The criteria applied by doctors to start a maintenance therapy in asthmatic children were the frequency of symptoms (36%), severity of symptoms (32%) and whether or not there was a severe disturbance in lung function testing (27%). For the selection of drugs, doctors tended to choose ICS. Generally, the first choice of drugs used in maintenance treatment of asthma in young children (0Y3y) were ICS (85%), the second was montelukast, and the third was ICS+ oral LABA(slow release sulbutamol) (67%), while in preschool and school children (4Y16y) the first choice was a LABA + ICS (84Y87%), the second was ICS (81Y83%) and the third montelukast (73%).

Background: Patient related factors like poor knowledge, individual beliefs and attitudes of patients influence control of asthma leading to nonadherence. This study was conducted to develop a validated KAPSE questionnaire for the Indian population and to assess the knowledge, attitude, practices and selfefficacy (KAPSE) of patients in Mysore regarding asthma and the impact of patient education on KAPSE in these patients. Methodology: A total of 225 adult patients participated in the KAPSE study and were part of the study that compared the efficacy and quality of life in patients receiving beclomethasone, budesonide or fluticasone. A questionnaire with 22 items was selected from Knowledge, Attitude and Self-Efficacy (KASE), a validated instrument for asthma and suitably modified to suit the cultural and educational level of the population. Two medical experts performed content validation and only those items with content validation index of above 0.75 were retained. Cognitive debriefing in 5 patients confirmed the suitability and acceptability of the questionnaire. Patient counseling individually and in groups and information leaflets about the pathology of asthma, drugs and delivery systems were conducted at every visit on 7 occasions, until 6 months. KAPSE was assessed at baseline before education and at the end of the study. Results: Patient education significantly improved most of the questions assessing Knowledge, Attitude, Practice and Self-efficacy compared to the baseline (pG0.05). Subgroup analysis revealed that KAPSE at baseline were not influenced by Age, Gender and Duration of disease (p90.05), but was related to educational levels and area of residence (pG0.05). Following patient education KAPSE of all the patients improved significantly (p G0.05) and there was no difference between patients of different areas of residence. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that regular patient education significantly improves different aspects of Knowledge, Attitude Practice and Self-efficacy of patients regardless of their age, gender, education or place of residence, which could positively influence patient medication adherence.",

Conclusion: Thus in our study comprising of 161 patients having the complaints of allergic asthma with or without allergic rhinitis, the HG therapy given after preparing the patient and continuing the above-mentioned drugs, during HG therapy was found to be effective in curing the allergic asthma. HG is effective in raising the SHBC thereby improving the immunity of the patient and also in reducing the serum IgE level.

            "text": "The prevalence of allergic diseases has increased all over the world during the last two decades. Dietary change is considered to be one of environmental factors that cause this increase and worsen allergic symptoms. If this is the case, an appropriate intake of foods or beverages with anti-allergic activities is expected to prevent the onset of allergic diseases and ameliorate allergic symptoms. Flavonoids, ubiquitously present in vegetables, fruits or teas possess anti-allergic activities. Flavonoids inhibit histamine release, synthesis of IL-4 and IL-13 and CD40 ligand expression by basophils. Analyses of structure-activity relationships of 45 flavones, flavonols and their related compounds showed that luteolin, ayanin, apigenin and fisetin were the strongest inhibitors of IL-4 production with an IC50 value of 2-5 mM and determined a fundamental structure for the inhibitory activity. The inhibitory activity of flavonoids on IL-4 and CD40 ligand expression was possibly mediated through their inhibitory action on activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells and AP-1. Administration of flavonoids into atopic dermatitis-prone mice showed a preventative and ameliorative effect. Recent epidemiological studies reported that a low incidence of asthma was significantly observed in a population with a high intake of flavonoids. Thus, this evidence will be helpful for the development of low molecular compounds for allergic diseases and it is expected that a dietary menu including an appropriate intake of flavonoids may provide a form of complementary and alternative medicine and a preventative strategy for allergic diseases. Clinical studies to verify these points are now in progress and we will present the result in the congress.",

Increases in asthma symptoms have been associated with menstrual variances. Pre-menstrual asthma has been noted in the literature and studies from as early as 1921 have suggested an allergic reaction to hormones. Bronchial asthma in female patients could be due to allergy to self-hormones particularly progesterone. Interestingly, progesterone is also a potent respiratory stimulant.

Sixteen females who had a previous diagnosis of severe asthma and who were nebulization dependent were selected for the study. After obtaining written informed consent from each patient spirometric studies were performed on these subjects Using sublingual progesterone as a bronchodilator. We analyzed changes over time of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ), the forced vital capacity (FVC), and the peak expiratory flow (PEF). For each patient we measured lung function three times: (1) before treatment, (2) after sublingual normal saline treatment (3) after sublingual progesterone treatment. Results: After treatment with sublingual progesterone, twelve of the sixteen patients (75%) experienced a significant bronchodilator effect (greater than 12% increase) in either FEV 1 or FVC. Eight (50%) experienced significant increase in both FEV 1 and FVC. Eight (50%), had an increase of 27% or greater in PEF. Conclusion: Progesterone dilutions are candidate drugs for the treatment of bronchial asthma. The possibility that dilutions of progesterone can act as a progesterone antagonist and that bronchial smooth muscle may be sensitive to such dilutions of progesterone due to activation of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway is interesting because of the close relationships between the immune and neuroendocrine systems. The study might have important implications for the development of a novel safe non-invasive treatment strategy against bronchial asthma due to hormone allergy.",

The synthesis of DolP was 8.8Y10.5-fold decreased in T-lymphocytes in patients with SRA. 10 days course of PP 5 mg supplementation in SRA patients returned DolP concentration in blood, urine and T-cells to the normal level. 8 of the 10 SRA patients demonstrated a significantly increase FEV up to 30% after 2-wk course of oral prednisone 20 mg twice daily and 5 mg of PP. Conclusion: Dolichyl Posphate Cycle (DPC) disorder is a rate limiting mechanism of steroid resistance in asthma and associated with a marked defect of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) N-glycosylation in CD4+ T-cells. Presented findings provide evidence that PP supplementation in patients with SRA enhanced the expression of alpha GP isoforms, restore the possibility to induce IL-10 synthesis and made CD4+ T-cells more responsive to steroids.

University of Tennessee, Department of Medicine, Memphis, United States. Background: Despite a number of effective pharmacological options for the prevention and treatment of the pathophysiologic responses that occur in sensitized patients on allergen exposure, the termination of allergic hypersensitivities remains an elusive therapeutic goal. By specific immunotherapy (SIT) with allergen extracts, allergy can be cured, however it has a limited scope of efficacy. Immunostimulatory sequence oligodeoxynucleotide (ISS-ODN) was known to provide potent allergen-independent immune redirection from Th2 into Th1. Objective: We investigated that with the animal model of mugwort allergy, the allergic inflammation is controlled by ISS-ODN and what is the mechanism of the immune redirection. Also we investigated that ISS-ODN with allergen as a model of potentiated SIT could have better anti-allergy effects on allergic inflammation induced by specific allergen over ISS-OND alone. Methods: Experiments were performed in four groups of mice which designed to develop mugwort allergy with sensitization and aerosol challenge with mugwort extract. Group 1 received 100 mg of ISS-ODN with 110 mg of mugwort allergen as a therapeutic group, Group 2, ISS-ODN with bovine serum albumin, Group 3, C-ODN (control ODN) with mugwort allergen, Group 4, ISS-ODN alone. Cytokine profiles of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-+, degree of inflammation in lung histology, and differential counts of bronchoalveolar lavage cells were measured. Results: Significant decreases of allergic inflammation in lung were observed in ISS-ODN with allergn group and ISS-ODN alone group comparing to negative control groups. IFN-+ was significantly increased in ISS-ODN with allergen group and ISS-ODN alone group comparing to control group. Conclusion: Allergic inflammation is controlled by ISS-ODN with allergen, which could be a new treatment of human allergic diseases.",

            "text": "Estrogen exerts protective effects in a murine model of asthma Methods: A mouse model of asthma was established by sensitizing and challenging female BALB/c mice with ovalbumin (OVA). In addition, some mice were given intranasal (IN) IL-13, which induces an asthma-like disease, including airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. For in vivo studies, the effect of IN E2 treatments on methacholine (MCh)-induced bronchoconstriction was analyzed by using a Buxco system, and airway responsiveness was recorded as PenH values. An increase in bronchoconstriction is reflected by an increase in PenH values. PenH was expressed as the mean T SEM. For in vitro studies, lungs of OVA-sensitized female BALB/c mice were sectioned and mounted in a perfusion chamber, and observed under a microscope. Images of selected airways were captured pre-and posttreatment with acetylcholine (ACh) or E2. Results: In vivo, the MCh-induced PenH of OVA-sensitized mice before treatment with E2 was 8.30T0.58. When this group of mice was treated IN with 1 nM E2 4-hr prior to MCh challenge, their PenH was lower (5.54T0.84). OVA-sensitized mice pre-treated with IN PBS, on the other hand, did not display any change in PenH. In preliminary studies, E2 also suppressed airway responsiveness in IL-13-treated mice (PenH of 5.35T2.39 versus 7.34T1.95 for E2 and control mice, respectively). In vitro, ACh-induced airway contraction (lumen area measured 99.7 2m 2 after 1 2M ACh compared to 116.8 2m 2 at baseline) was reversed when treated with 1 2M E2 (109.1 2m 2 ). Pre-treatment of the airways with 12M E2 pre-treatment blocked the ACh-induced contraction (lumen area measured 125.1 2m 2 after 12M ACh compared to 126.8 2m 2 at baseline and 125.8 2m 2 after E2). Conclusion: These data suggest that estradiol can inhibit and prevent AHR associated with antigen and IL-13 in a murine model of asthma. Thus, estrogen analogues might play a therapeutic role in the management of asthma. Allergens and rhinovirus infections are among the most common elicitors of asthma, a severe disabling disease affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. We report the construction of a recombinant combination vaccine for allergen-and rhinovirus-induced asthma. Using a peptide from one of the most frequent respiratory allergens, the major timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 1, and the human rhinovirus-derived coat protein VP1 required for infection of respiratory cells a recombinant fusion protein was produced. Immunization with this fusion protein induced in mice and rabbits protective IgG antibodies which recognized the allergen and neutralized the infection of cells expressing the receptor for human rhinoviruses. The vaccine exhibited neither IgE nor T cell-mediated allergenic activities. The described principle may be used for the combined vaccination against allergic and infectious asthma. An Internet-based questionnaire study was conducted of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and parents of children with asthma to evaluate adherence to regimens of treatment and convenience of use of inhaled and transdermal preparations. Valid responses were obtained from 1,470 patients. Among asthmatic patients, the percentage of those who selected Btaking as prescribed[ was 52.7% for inhalant users and 83.2% for transdermal users. Among patients with COPD, the corresponding values were 54.7% and 86.6%. There was a significant difference (pG0.01) in percentage between inhaled and transdermal preparations for both airway diseases. The most common reason for poor adherence was Bfrequency of administration[, and a high proportion of patients, 83.2%, preferred once-daily administration. In addition, patients who had used both preparations preferred transdermal to inhalant drugs, to a significant extent. In conclusion, health care professionals should further educate their patients about the importance of treatment with inhalants, since poor adherence to treatment with inhaled agents significantly hinders achievement of optimal efficacy. In addition, transdermal tulobuterol patch, which is administered once daily as a long-acting beta2agonist, appears to be useful for long-term control of both asthma and COPD.",

Background: Nebulizer solutions of asthma medications are often mixed together in order to simplify inhalation regimens, although not recommended. We therefore evaluated the effect of admixture on aerosol characteristics. Methods: An 8-stage cascade impactor was used to measure the particle size distribution of admixture of Pulmicort \\ Respules \\ (budesonide, 0.5mg/2mL) with Meptin \\ Inhalation Solution Unit (procaterol hydrochloride, 302g/ 0.3mL) from a jet nebulizer, PARI LC Plus \\ . Concentrations of each drug were assayed by HPLC. Physico-chemical compatibility was also assessed up to 48 hours after mixing. Results: Impaction analysis revealed no differences in aerodynamic size and output of each drug between admixture and single-drug solutions. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of budesonide from the admixture with procaterol was 2.92 T 0.03 2m, and 2.99 T 0.14 from single-drug solution. The respirable mass of budesonide from the admixture was comparable with that from single solution (146.8 T 2.9, 147.6 T 8.2 2g, respectively). There was no significant change in pH or visual identification of a precipitate in the admixture. Recovery rates of each drug kept more than 96% of the initial values during the observation period.

Background: It has been of great interest to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in achieving asthma control. This interest is justified as the most recent GINA guidelines put an emphasis on control of asthma as a baseline for asthma management. Furthermore, this is the first study on SLIT in Bulgaria since this rout of administration of immunotherapy has been available for two years in the country. ",

Methods: 50 patients with asthma and allergy to dust mites (Dermatophagoides pternyssinus and/or Dermatophagoides farinae or both) were included in the study. 21males and 29 females, aged from 12 to 35 years (mean 23,5). SLIT has been prescribed in 25 of them (12 men) for one year along with other antiasthma therapy. A control group of 25 patients (10 men) had been maintained on medical therapy alone. Asthma Control Test /ACT/ was performed to asses the level of control for the last four weeks. On the basis of number score, asthma control was estimated as: out of control, partially controlled and completely controlled. Assessments of FVC and FEO1 were performed too. Results: From the group of patients, subjected to SLIT + medical treatment, 12 (48%) were completely controlled, 9 (36%) Y partially controlled and 4 (16%) out of control for the last four weeks of the study. From those on medical treatment alone, 5 (20%) were completely controlled, 10 (40%) partially controlled and 10 (40%) were out of control for the past four weeks. FVC and FEO1 did not differ in both groups. Patients on SLIT were better controlled (pG0.05) after the first year of treatment. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that SLIT affords additional benefit to medical treatment in patients with asthma and allergy to dust mites. The results suggest that SLIT, added to medical treatment is of advantage in achieving asthma control. Background: Depigmented and polymerised allergen vaccines have shown to be efficacious using objective and subjective outcomes. It is now recognized that treatments under evaluation should enable patients to feel better in their day-to-day life activities. The objective was to evaluate the impact in the quality of life of a group of 64 asthmatic patients sensitised to house dust mites. Materials and Methods: The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Sixty-four patients were randomly allocated to either receive active treatment (n=32) or placebo (n=32). The active treatment was a therapeutic vaccine containing a mixture of depigmented and glutaraldehyde polymerized mixture of allergen extracts of D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire developed by Marks was used. It was conducted at baseline and after each administration of allergen vaccine (19 times). This is a 20-item self administered questionnaire, developed to measure quality of life in adult subjects with asthma by measuring a total scale score together with subscale scores for breathlessness, mood disturbance, social disruption and concerns for health. The result was expressed as the mean of all 19 measurements, Mann-Whitney's test was used to evaluate the statistical differences between both groups, and Hodges-Lehmann for the effect size of these differences. Results: The AQLQ overall score was the sum of all individual scores. The values of the mean for these scores were 7.44 (95% CI: 5.78Y9.11) for the active group and 11.44 (95% CI: 9.67Y13.22) for the placebo. The differences between both groups were significant (p=0.043, Mann-Whitney's test) and relevant (Hodges-Lehmann test: j4.36, 95% CL: j8.69,j0.10). The active group showed an improvement of 34.98% over placebo. Conclusion: The results of this clinical trial show that the immunotherapytreated patients, in contrast with untreated, experience a significant improvement in the overall quality of life related to asthma. The statistical significance as well as the improvement on the active group compared with the placebo occurred also in the domains of breathlessness, social disruption and concerns for health, with the exception for mood disturbance.",

International Medical Center of Japan, Pulmonology, Tokyo, Japan. Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, and inhaled corticosteroids have been shown to be very effective in controlling symptoms. However, it is important to minimize the dosage of corticosteroids used because of local and systemic adverse effects. The importance of leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of asthma is established and many studies have shown that leukotriene receptor antagonists can improve asthma control in patients with poorly controlled asthma despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 8 weeks' pranlukast treatment on quality of life and pulmonary function in patients with inadequately controlled asthma. Methods: This study was conducted at 312 hospitals and clinics in Japan from October 2004 to March 2005. We recruited 1546 outpatients (mean age 51.4T18.5 years) with mild-to-severe asthma (as defined by the Japanese Society of Allergology) who were not well controlled with daily antiasthmatic treatment. During the 8-week treatment period, patients received pranlukast (225mg, twice a day) in addition to their previous treatment. Patients were required to complete symptom diaries and record peak expiratory flow (PEF) on a daily basis. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the Asthma Health Questionnaire (AHQ). Results: A total of 839 asthmatic patients were enrolled. Significant improvements were observed in the AHQ total score and all subscale scores. When the patients were classified according to baseline disease severity (mild, moderate and severe), the improvement from baseline remained significant for all AHQ subscale scores other than the economics subscale in all patient groups.",

Asahi General Hospital, Research Center for Allergy and Clinical Immunolog, Asahi City, Japan. Background: Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department (ED) visits. It has been shown that high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in addition to standard emergency treatment for acute asthma induces the early termination of the asthmatic attacks and reduces the number of hospitalizations. In addition, it has been reported that about 15 to 30% of the asthmatic patients treated in the ED will relapse to require additional interventions within 2 weeks of ED discharge. However, little is known about the efficacy of oral corticosteroid in reducing the relapse in the asthmatic patients discharged from the ED after treatment of acute asthma. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of oral corticosteroid in reducing relapse following the emergency treatment of acute asthma. Methods: Patients with acute asthma were treated with nebulized salbutamol and intravenous 125 mg methylprednisolone and 200 mg theophylline and were then discharged from the ED. Upon discharge, some patients were given oral 20 to 30 mg/day prednisolone for 5 days. Results: The asthmatic patients who received oral prednisolone had a significant decrease in the need for repeated emergency care (5.4%, 4 out of 74 patients, pG0.0001) within 2 weeks as compared with those who did not (33.3%, 73 out of 219 patients). The mean dose of prednisolone was 24.4 mg/ day and the mean duration was for 4.4 days. Conclusion: It is concluded that a 5-day course of medium-dose oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) in outpatients prevents the relapse following the emergency treatment of acute asthma.",

Background: Treatment guidelines for childhood asthma is available, but it is important to know whether this guideline is being used in East Java. Methods: Using a standardized questionnaire on monitoring and treatment of childhood asthma, distributed to doctors treating childhood asthma in East Java. Results: Only 70 (20%) out of 350 doctors participated in this questionnaire study. General practitioners were 75.7%, 5.7% paediatricians and 2.9% pulmonologists. 88.6% worked in policlinic or private hospitals, and only 5.7% worked in university hospitals. Symptom score, peak flow meter or spirometry never or seldom used to monitor childhood asthma (94%). Nebulised salbutamol/terbutaline was the first drug of choice (63.8%) for treating acute asthma attack, followed by iv or im corticosteroids (23.7%), and iv aminophylline (30.6%). The three main criteria for admitting acute attacks were based on personal clinical judgement (80.0%), no improvement after 2 or 3 doses of salbutamol inhaler (44.4%) and other factors such as home distance and travel time (37.0%). IV aminophylline was seldom used (60.0%). Systemic (57.1%) and inhaled corticosteroids (50.7%) were seldom used in outpatient setting. Corticosteroids were used in all admitted patients. The corticosteroid of choice were dexamethasone (50.0%), methylprednisolone(45.7%), and were used same the dose for 5 days. Oxygen therapy, based on pulse oximetry reading were used only for severe asthma (45.6%). Antibiotics were used only in case of pneumonia, otitis media or sinusitis (40.0%). Drug of choice in the maintenance treatment of asthma in all ages were the same: LABA was the first choice, followed by LABA + inhaled corticosteroid and inhaled corticosteroids. Maintenance treatment was seldom used in all ages. The main criterium to start a maintenance treatment was the severity of the symptoms (47.1%). Specific immunotherapy never been used (72.1%). Conclusion: Although treatment guidelines for asthma in children is available, in daily practice we still find many modifications, including the usage of a LABA as first choice maintenance treatment. More efforts in socialization of the guidelines and providing tools for monitoring and treatment of asthma in children are needed.",

All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Physiology, New Delhi, India. Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies such as herbal therapy, acupuncture, yoga, chiropractic, relaxation techniques, nutrition and dietary supplements, continue to gain popularity as modalities for the management of asthma. However there is a dearth of qualitative research with strong methodology to understand plausible mechanism of action of these therapies on asthma. The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the use of yoga as an adjuvant therapy in the management of bronchial asthma. Methods: The study was conducted on 57 adult patients having mild or moderate bronchial asthma who were allocated randomly to either the yoga group (n = 29) or the wait-listed control group (n = 28). The control group received conventional treatment whereas the yoga group received, in addition to conventional treatment, also an intervention based on certain yogic practices. The outcome measures were assessed in both groups at 0 wk (baseline), 2 wk, 4 wk and 8 wk. Results: In the yoga group, there was a steady and progressive improvement in pulmonary function. There was also a trend towards a reduction in exerciseinduced fall in timed vital capacity (FEV1) in the exercise-sensitive (exercise induced asthma) subgroup of subjects in the yoga group. However, there was no corresponding reduction in the excretion of urinary prostaglandin D2 metabolite (11\"-PGF2!) in response to the exercise challenge, which is an indicator of mast cell activation. There was also no significant chan there was a significant reduction in serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels after 2 wk in yoga group alone. NNT for quality of life indicators worked out to be 2.41 in QOL symptoms, 1.66 in QOL activity limitation, 1.91 in QOL emotional function, 1.70 in QOL environmental stimuli and 1.82 in total quality of life.",

Background: The effect of inhaled steroids on oxidative stress in asthmatics is unclear. In this study the levels of lipid peroxides in the serum of asthmatic patients, whose symptoms were controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists, were measured. Methods: Twenty-four asthmatic patients and 15 matched, healthy controls were recruited. Oxidative stress levels were quantified by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Results: After 3 months of treatment, the mean lipid peroxide concentrations were significantly higher in asthmatic patients than in the healthy controls (4.3 +/j 0.15 micromol/mL vs. 3.4 +/j 0.03 micromol/mL, respectively).",

Sustained-release formulation as capsule and dry syrup forms was developed to reduce its adverse effects and improve its clinical effects. We compared between therapeutic effects of theophylline dry syrup and capsules in children with mild asthma. Methods: Ninety children with mild asthma were randomized to receive either theophylline dry syrup (n = 44) or theophylline capsules (n = 46), 4 mg per kilogram of body weight twice a day for 12 weeks. Baseline and serial measurements of daytime and nighttime asthma symptom score were performed. Compliance score, drug swallowing score, and drug usability score were measured every 4 weeks. Each scoring rated on a scale of 0Y4. Serum theophylline concentration were mesured at 4 and 12 weeks. To examine anti-inflammatory effect of theophylline on asthma, Serum eosinophilic cationic protein as a marker of airway inflammation caused by eosinophil was measured 12 weeks pre-and post-administration. Results: Daytime and nighttime asthma symptom score of two groups after 4 weeks significantly improved than baseline score. Daytime and nighttime asthma symptom score in dry syrup group were statistically lower at all time points except for nighttime symptom score at 4 weeks. Compliance score, drug swallowing score, and drug usability score in dry syrup group were significantly higher at end time point. Only in dry syrup group, serum ECP at end time point was statistically lower than baseline. Conclusion: Low-dose sustained-release theophylline may be safe and effective in bronchial asthma and this effect may be mediated by its antiinflammatory action mechanisms. Especially, when used in children with asthma, dry syrup formulation is recommended because of its higher compliance than that of capsule formulation.",

Kazan Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology attached to Rospotrebnadzor, Allergology and Immunology Department, Kazan, Russian Federation. Background: Patients with chronic severe asthma are often dependent on the long term prescription of oral glucocorticosteroids. The use of steroids is associated with serious side effects. Physicians treating such patients continue to search for alternative therapies that reduce the need for chronic dosing oral steroids. Aim: To assess efficacy and safety of 24-months treatment with Salmeterol/ Fluticasone propionate (100/ 1000 mcg daily) and Fluticasone propionate (1000 mcg daily) in 105 steroid-dependent bronchial asthma patients aged 18 to 60 years, who had received oral glucocorticosteroids (predisolone equivalent) less than 10 mg daily (75,2%) and more than 10 mg daily (23,8%) for at least 6 months but not more than 10 years. Methods: This was comparative, randomized, multicentre, open study in parallel groups (15 visits at 2 weeks intervals). Oral glucocorticosteroids dose reduction phase started at 3-rd visit. Results: Inspite of continual treatment with oral glucocorticosteroids patients did not reach asthma control. After 6-months treatment maintenance dose of prednisolone was 6 times lower in comparison with baseline. Moreover, oral glucocorticosteroids were abolished in each second patient receving Salmeterol/ fluticasone propionate and each third patient receiving Fluticasone propionate. At the same time asthma control and quality of life significantly increased. Administration high doses of fluticasone propionate and decreasing dose of oral glucocorticosteroids lead to reliable increase the morning level of serum cortisol by the sixth month of treatment in both groups of patients. Conclusion: The treatment with Fluticasone propionate and Salmeterol/ fluticasone propionate allows reduce the dose of oral glucocorticosteroids, moreover in the most causes patients can abolish oral glucocorticosteroids maintaining good asthma control.",

The modern era of inhalation dates back from 70 years ago. One of the major problem in the management of Bronchial Asthma and COPD lies not in the airways but on the prescription. Technique of inhalation is crucial for the management of such diseases. With this background the present study was designed to find out, How the patients are using their inhalation devices? How does patient education affect their inhalation technique? What are their views and apprehensions regarding inhalation therapy and problems they face with this mode of therapy. The study was undertaken in 284 patients, 196 using Dry Powder Inhalation and 88 using MDI. The results were evaluated and we found that about half of the patients were not using their devices correctly. Among incorrect users majority were those with MDI. Among correct users majority of patients were educated the technique by their physicians or paramedics. One fourth of patients were wrong while preparing for inhalation, more than 80% incorrect users were not breathing out before inhalation, half of the patients were inhaling drug with inadequate efforts and more than 85% were not holding breath after inhalation. Cough, sudden spasm and dysphonia were the pr5oblems faced by 20%, and fear of addiction was the most common apprehension of using inhalation. Details of the study will be presented.",

Here we describe the implementation of asthma guidelines and the development of the house rule and patient self management protocol. The setting is Lepp\u00e4vaara health care centre with six GP-nurse teams each providing primary care for 10 000 inhabitants. National Asthma Programme 1994Y2004 delegated the responsibility in preventing and treating asthma to the primary health care. The evidence based guidelines published 2000, updated 2006, gives the general outline in asthma treatment. Materials and Methods: Participatory observation and document analysis using qualitative methods Results: Two GPs and two nurses were nominated to asthma co-ordinators to act as internal consultants. They organized many workshops during 2000Y2007 to introduce the guidelines and to develop asthma management. The governmental Centre for Pharmacotherapy Development joined the implementation activities by providing training of trainers, and material and tutorial support.

Exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) is widely prevalent in asthmatic individuals particularly in children varying from 40% to 90% in various reports. There are, however, few studies addressing the effects of asthma severity on airway responsiveness to exercise from India. Aim: In examining the mechanisms of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), it is important to determine which factors mainly affect the severity of EIB. We report such factors in patients with asthma by stepwise multiple-regression analysis. Methods: Sixty five asthmatic children (age range 10Y14 years), 200 adults between 20 to 44 years old were selected randomly as representative of persons living in the city of Mumbai. All subjects filled out a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms. Bronchodilator therapy was withheld three days before the study. The exposure to house dust mite allergens was estimated from dust samples obtained in the subjects' homes. Eosinophil count was done from peripheral blood. Serum Il-4 was estimated in adult asthmatics by ELISA method. Atopic status was labeled on the basis of Total serum IgE and Modified Skin Prick Test and subjected to exercise challenge. assessments of atopy. An exercise challenge test was done (8 min) bout of cycle-ergometer exercise): decrease in PEFR of 15% was considered positive for EIB. Results: Atopic adults showed significantly higher sensitization to house dust mite compared to children (p G 0.05). Significant rise in incidence of EIB was observed in adults (62.6%) against 40% in children ( p G 0.05) showing direct relationship of house dust mite sensitization in both the groups ( adults correlation coefficients: r = 0.955 p G 0.001, children r = 03135 p T 0.05). Relative risk of developing EIB associated with HDM sensitivity was higher in adults (2.85 at 95% CI ). Regression analysis showed direct relationship between the severity of EIB and serum IL-4 levels (r2 = 0.03 p G0.0001). Raised eosinophils were well correlated with serum IL-4 levels. Conclusion: The findings suggest that though EIB is common in children, adults were more significantly affected. Allergen specific IgE to house dust mite, serum IL-4 and eosinophilia were the major associated contributing factors in the development of EIB in asthmatic patients. Clinical Implications: Patients with exercise induced bronchospasm may benefit from novel tharapies specially designed to target the specfic mechanisms underlying airway inflammation.",

Background: As indicated in Asthma guidelines, treatments`goal should be the total control of asthma and consequently a minimal impact of asthma on patient`s life. Aim: The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between FEV1, control of asthma and quality of life in real life. Methods: In a 1 month period, asthmatic patients were enrolled consecutively during their routine control visit. A spirometry was performed for every patient. Patients were asked to complete 2 different questionnaires: the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a brief instrument developed to assess asthma control of patients in a clinical setting, and the Rhinasthma, a 30 items tool aimed at evaluating the impact of respiratory allergy on quality of life. It provides 4 different scores: Upper Airways (UA), Lower Airways (LA), Respiratory Allergy Impact (RAI) and Global Summary (GS). Results: Seventy-four asthmatic outpatients (30 men and 44 women; mean age 44.11 + 14.83) were enrolled. 53 had concomitant rhinitis. For 39 patients (52.7%) the control of asthma was achieved; 35 (47.3%) didn`t obtain asthma control. FEV1 value (mean 88.45 + 16.13) correlates with ACT and with Rhinasthma, LA and RAI. ACT significantly correlated with the four Rhinasthma scores. Subdividing patients according to the score (optimal and good control vs non control) and comparing the level of control measured by means of ACT we obtained a significant correlation between ACT and LA (p. 0.0001), RAI (p. 0.01) and GS (0.0001) and no correlation with Rhinasthma UA score (p 0.053). The analysis of the patients' population showed that a well or total control was achieved in 53% of patients with asthma and 51% of patients with both asthma and rhintis. The subanalysis of 53 patients with concomitant rhinitis showed worse Rhinasthma scores for all the domains compared with patients with asthma alone (p. G 0.05). Discussion: Our results show that asthma control is related to an improvement in quality of life; nevertheless, asthmatic patients often refer also symptoms due to rhinitis that have an important impact on their Quality of Life. So, in order to improve Quality of Life of asthmatic patients, the treatment of patients with rhinitis and asthma includes both lower and upper airways treatment.",

Objective: Multiple relationships between anxiety, allergic symptoms, and treatment difficulties have been observed. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of anxiety disorders in outpatients with various allergic diseases, to identify diagnostic cues or possible risk factors, and to test the usefulness of self-administered questionnaire screening at the allergy clinic. Methods: Six hundred forty-six (646) consecutive patients with rhinoconjunctivitis (59.3%), asthma (26.8%), or Bother[ allergy (13.9%), aged 16 to 65 years, completed self-administered questionnaires in six outpatient allergy clinics; 60 of the respondents also participated in structured psychiatric interviews. Anxiety was measured with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety. Results: According to the interviews, STAI-T 9 52 predicted with 86% accuracy a current psychiatric diagnosis, without differentiating between anxiety and depression. Using this threshold, the rate of anxiety and/or depressive disorders is estimated as 19% (95% CI: 15.9Y22.1) in our unselected allergic outpatient sample; 46% of these patients never received any psychopharmacological treatment, indicating that anxiety related disorders are underdiagnosed and undertreated. Risk indicators were female gender; asthma; perennial symptoms; sleep problems; nonspecific allergy triggers like strong emotions; stressful situations; and considerable limitation in everyday activities attributed to the allergic symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings confirm a high rate of anxiety and/or depressive disorders in patients visiting the allergy clinic. Self-administered questionnaires such as STAI-T provide reliable help for the identification of these frequent psychiatric problems. Key Words: anxiety, allergy, rhinitis, asthma, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, depression. Issues: Health care assessment system in Nepal is still take long time and high cost. Collection of data about prioritization of community health problems by the community is essential for planning and monitoring of programs and interventions for improving community health status. Scientific Rapid Community Health Assessment Methodology needs to be validated in rural community developing country like Nepal which is economic and less time consuming. Objective: To validate the Rapid Community Health Assessment Methodology (RCHA) for prioritization of community health problems in a rural community. Study Area: 14 Villages of rural areas. STUDY POPULATION: 34 Primary School Teachers from 10 randomly selected Primary Schools in above villages. (One Teacher each from Class I to V, in each School). VALIDATION: Heads of households from 500 Households (50 per village, systematically sampled). DATA Collection technique: Self-Administered Questionnaires for Teachers, Interview Schedules for Heads of Households. DATA ANALYSIS: with the help of EPI info program. Results: There was significant correlation between the responses of the school teachers and heads of households on community health problems viz., (a) the prioritization of ten village problems(r = +0.77, p G 0.02), (b) prioritization of utilization of services of various health functionaries for treatment of and advice for children`s illnesses (r = + 0.75, p G 0.05), and (c) prioritization of households using water from different sources(r = + 0.975, p G 0.02). The method was also found to be more rapid (3.3 times) and less costly (6.3 times) compared to the traditional household survey method. Conclusion: Rapid Community Health Assessment Methodology (RCHA) for prioritization of community health problems in a rural community is validated. The information thus obtained can be utilized for purposes of health policy and program planning, monitoring and evaluation. This is especially relevant for micro planning of child health services in developing countries. Repeated use of questionnaires for monitoring disease control programs must be carefully considered. Further studies to confirm and reconfirm the results of this study may be done before wider application of above methodology. Aim: To assess the temporal changes of medicines consumption in relation to risk factors for respiratory symptoms/diseases in a subsample of a general population of Italian adults. Methods: Within the Po Delta and Pisa epidemiological surveys, subjects who habitually used medicines at baseline were selected as cases. Controls were non-drug consuming subjects randomly drawn and matched for gender and age groups. 1663 subjects (89% of those invited) participated in a telephone interview (follow-up = 11 years) with questions on current drug consumption, respiratory health status, life habits, and comorbidity, beside socio-demographic characteristics. Main characteristics were: 37.2% males, mean age 63yrs, cases = 46.2%. We used logistic regression models accounting for smoking habit, gender, age, comorbidities, respiratory symptoms, occupational/passive smoking/environmental exposure. Results: There was a non significant increase between baseline and follow-up for prevalence of asthma (5.8 vs 7.1%) or rhinitis (20.6 vs 23%). Prevalence rate of habitual use of any medicine at follow-up was 70.1 vs 46.2% at baseline (p G 0.001). Among the users (N=1166), we found higher prevalences of broncho-pulmonary (7.5 vs 4.8%) (significantly) and antiallergic drugs (2.4 vs 1.3%) (non significantly) at follow-up. New regular use of any medicines at follow-up was 60.4%, while persistence and cessation were 37.6 and 18.6%, respectively. Only asthma resulted significantly related to the use of medicines at baseline (OR 1.69, 95%CI 1.04Y2.73), while at follow-up the relation was significant for both asthma (2.92, 1.51Y5.66) and rhinitis (1.55, 1.03Y2.33).).

Methods: All new referrals were prospectively captured in the New Case Registry during the study period 1 July 1998 to 31 December 2006. Results: There were 227 referrals from public sector primary care physicians comprising 8.4% of all referrals. More than half (57.7%) were females and mean age was 36 T 18 years. The majority (79.7%) were Chinese. The most common referring diagnoses were drug allergy [DA] (35.7%), urticaria and angioedema (23.3%) and food allergy [FA] (10.1%). In contrast, the final diagnosis of the attending allergist was DA in 9.7%, NSAID intolerance in 22.5%, and FA in 7.5% respectively. Among cases with primary care physician diagnosed DA, the allergist`s diagnosis was DA in 23.5%, NSAID intolerance in 40.7% and not DA in 35.8%. Among cases with primary care physician diagnosed FA, the allergist`s diagnosis was FA in only 31.6%. Chronic idiopathic urticaria comprised 19.1% of all cases of urticaria/angioedema. The following conditions were under-diagnosed by family physicians compared to allergists: anaphylaxis (1.8% versus 4%), asthma (2.6% versus 6.6%), atopic eczema (1.8% versus 6.6%), allergic rhinitis (7.5% versus 19.8%). Among all referrals for suspected allergy, 5.7% were deemed not to have any allergic disorder upon completion of evaluation. Conclusion: DA, urticaria/angioedema and FA were the most common reasons for referral. NSAID intolerance accounted for the majority of cases of Fdrug allergy`referred by primary care physicians. Allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic eczema, and anaphylaxis were under-diagnosed, potentially leading to patients being deprived of appropriate therapy for allergic airway disease and life-saving epinephrine autoinjectors. Increasing the awareness and education may be useful in improving the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases in the community.",

Background: To describe a 46 year old patient with chronic urticaria, unresponsive to standard therapy, who responds to oral beta agonists and to propose possible mechanisms of action. Methods: We performed basic bloodwork and checked eosinophil levels, ANA, ESR, CBC, CMP, anti-thyroid antibodies, TSH and complement levels. Skin biopsy was performed as well. Results: Patient with history of diabetes mellitus presents for treatment of chronic urticaria x 15 years. Initially, patient responded to corticosteroids but since then no medications have helped, including Allegra, Doxepin, and Periactin. Test results revealed normal eosinophil levels, negative ANA, normal ESR, CBC, CMP, Anti-thyroid antibodies, TSH and complement levels. As patient was unresponsive to other medications and requiring frequent oral corticosteroids, albuterol sulfate 4 mg tablets were given. Patient took approximately 32 mg of albuterol orally each day for approximately 14 days in addition to her anti-histamine. On return visit, patient`s symptoms had resolved completely. Conclusion: Beta agonists have a good side effect profile compared to oral corticosteroids and may be of great benefit in reducing urticarial symptoms. Possible mechanisms of action include inhibition of anti-IgE induced histamine release thru desensitization of beta adrenoceptors. They may be a promising pharmacotherapy in the treatment of chronic urticaria. Background: Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a relatively common disease, and yet not much is known about the causative factors or the pathomechanism, which makes it difficult to cure. Due to its chronic nature, many patients suffer from significant detrimental effects on their quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of CIU on the QOL of Korean patients, and to determine whether a relationship exists between QOL and the severity of disease. Methods: One hundred twenty four patients with CIU, who first visited our out-patient clinic from August 2005 to July 2007, were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to assess the effects of CIU on the daily lives of patients. QOL was divided into six different categories: mental status (MS), daily living activities (DLA), leisure activities (LA), self-perception (SP), treatmentinduced restrictions (TIR), and social restrictions (SR). All of the QOL scores were recalibrated to a 0Y100 scale, with 100 indicating the worst QOL, and 0 the most favorable. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to analyze the relationship between the six different QOL categories, as well as the association between disease duration and QOL. One way ANOVA was used to analyze the relationship between disease severity and QOL. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The average QOL scores obtained from the questionnaire were as follows: MS (50.64), DLA (47.58), LA (39.85), SP (37.06), TIR (35.54), and SR (33.23). The results showed that patients were most affected mentally, and that social restrictions were the least significant. The six different categories showed a positive correlation amongst themselves, which demonstrates that CIU exerts an influence on not one, but many aspects of QOL. LA and TIR were significantly affected in longer term CIU cases (p G 0.05), while SP, MS, DLA, and SR did not show a significant relationship with disease duration. Disease severity was found to have a significant effect on the SR, LA, and TIR categories (p G 0.05). Conclusion: Based on these results, it is suggested that CIU has a negative impact on the QOL of Korean patients. Therefore, it is important to recognize the effects CIU can have on QOL and consider them as candidates for treatment as well.",

Ajou University School of Medicine, Allergy & Rheumatology, Suwon, Republic of Korea. Background and Objective: ASA ingestion could induce acute and chronic urticaria, however their pathogenic mechanisms are not understood. We compared the level of neutorphil activation and related cytokine between ASA intolerant acute urticaria (AIAU) and ASA intolerant chronic urticaria (AICU). Methods: The 88 patients with AICU, the 51 patients with AIAU and the 102 patients, normal control (NC) were enrolled. The clinical and laboratory findings including serum myeloperoxidase (MPO) level, IL-8 and IL-18 levels were compared among AIAU, AICU, and NC groups. The correlations between MPO and, IL-8, IL-18 were observed. Results: The level of serum MPO were significantly higher in AIAU than in AICU and NC (p=0.032, p=0.014 respectively). The level of IL-18 was significantly higher in AIAU than in NC (p=0.006), while no significant difference was noted in IL-8 level. Within the AIAU patients, significant correlation were noted between MPO and IL-8 (r=0.36, p=0.01), not with IL-18. It is known that about 20% of people develop urticaria at least once in their lives. Chronic idiopathic urticaria affects up to 3% of the population. The incidence of acute urticaria is higher in people with atopy, and the incidence of chronic urticaria is not increased in people with atopy. This study shows that most cases of urticaria are related to such gastointestinal disorders as active gastritis, esophagitis and peptic ulcer. One of the most interesting things is that urticaria is likely to be only a single symptom of a severe and maybe lifethreatening gastrointestinal disorder. Methods: 10 patients with acute (3) or chronic (7) urticaria passed gastroscopy after 5Y14 days of the onset of urticaria. In addition to urticaria, 3 had angioedema, 1 suffered from severe pruritus with desquamation and 1 developed palmar eczema. Results: All patients showed to have different gastrointestinal problems, which correlated very well with the anamnesis data. 7 had gastric erosions, among which 3 with esophagitis; 1 had esophagitis with atrophic gastritis, 1 esophagitis alone, 1 patient with severe generalized urticaria had 2 big (1 cm each) duodenal ulcers. The patient with concomitant pruritus had lots of severe gastric, esophagal and duodenal erosions. Only 3 patients suffered from ocasional epigastric pain or heartburn, but none said that symptoms were severe. Gastrointestinal cause was suspected because episodes of urticaria developed or increased after irritating or acid food (spice, citruses, strawberries), drinks (alcohol, soda) or drugs (NSAIDs, acetyl-cysteinum, ascorbinic acid) but trigger factors were always different and dose-dependent. 9 patients that underwent anti-reflux, antacid, antisecretory and some (2) antibiotic therapy along with symptomatic antihistamine drugs recovered (8) or showed much relief (1). 1 patient with severe pruritus didn't pass prescribed treatment and chose his usual intramuscular injection of diprospan instead. As always, he reported a short 2-week relief of symptoms. Conclusion: These data show that urticaria alone or with angioedema very often occurs as a symptom of a gastrointestinal disorder. It is very important to prescribe gastroscopy and adequate treatment not only to stop urticaria, but moreover to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, very genlty operating with steroids, especially oral, in such patients.",

Peking University Third Hospital, Dermatology, Beijing, China. Background: Etiology and prognosis of acute urticaria has not been reported in China. Objective: To investigate the etiology and outcome of acute urticaria in a university dermatology setting. Methods: A prospective follow up study was performed. All patients with acute urticaria seen by authors between March 2005 and July 2006 in department of dermatology, Peking University Third Hospital were asked to participate. Etiologic agents and triggers were evaluated by comprehensive and detailed history and physical examination, supplemented with selected laboratory testing and follow up. Prognosis was assessed at 9 months after the first visiting. Cure was defined as complete free of symptoms for more than 6 months without relapse after cessation of the treatment. Results: 75 patients participated. There were 22 male, 53 female, with age ranged 1.5 to 83 years. Of those, 60% were between 18 to 40 years; 32% had a history of acute urticaria during childhood; and 6.5% were atopic. Etiologic agents or triggers could be identified in 54.7% of the patients including medications (21.4%), infection (20%), food (8%), physical stimuli (2.7%), insect bite (1.3%) and contactant (1.3%). In 71 patients finished the follow up, 58 cases (81.7%) cured. 13 patients, all etiology and triggers unidentified, progressed to chronic urticaria, but 6 of them free of symptoms at the end of evaluation. The overall cure rate in patients with disease duration less than one week was 94%, which was much higher than that of patients with a longer duration (41.2%, p G 0.05, chi-square test). Sex, age and severity of the disease had no effect on the prognosis. Conclusion: Etiology and triggers can be identified in more than half of acute urticaria patients. Medicaments, infection and food are common triggers. The outcome of acute urticaria is favorable. The longer disease duration (over a week) is an important risk for poor prognosis. Results: Among 152 patients remitted for evaluation of allergy to penicillins, 47(31%) had angioedema, but in only 39 (26%) penicillin was not excluded as the cause (exclusion by controlled administration of penicillins and s-tryptase). Aspirin (11), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (6), ACE inhibitors (10) and other drugs (10) were seen as the cause mediated by leukotrienes, bradykinin and direct mast cell degranulation. Food was suspected in 28. Insect sting the cause in 16/40 (honeybee 1/9 and wasp 15/31) and occupational agents in 5/43: latex (nurse), fish protein, flour, dyes, nikel. In only one the c1-esterase inhibitor was slight reduced. Angioedema was associated to allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma. Infections and physical stimuli were well known inducers in rather few. Most patients with non-drug induced angioedema had prophylactic anaphylactic medication with corticosteroid and antihistamines at home. 48 had epinephrine (epipen, autoinjector). Conclusion: Urticaria and angioedema are the most frequent manifestations of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). Many different causes may induce angioedema. However, IgE-mediated mechanism is the most frequent suspected cause of angioedema in a department of medicine.",

Recently, it has been observed that autologous plasma skin test (APST) scores positive more frequently than ASST in CU patients, and its positivity is associated with the activation of coagulation cascade. Aim: We report a case of chronic urticaria successfully treated with anticoagulant therapy using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to see whether symptom control is associated with reduction of coagulation activation. Methods: A 63-year-old woman, with a 3-year history of unremitting CU, was evaluated in our outpatient allergy clinic. No other diseases were present in her clinical history. CU improved only with prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day, plus anti-H1 antihistamine, while therapy tapering led to symptom recurrence. Known causes of CU were ruled out with laboratory and instrumental examinations. ASST, APST, negative control with saline solution and positive control with histamine were performed after a 5-day discontinuation of steroid and anti-H1 therapy, and repeated after 15 days of LMWH therapy. Prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, marker of coagulation activation, and D-dimer, marker of fibrinolysis, were measured by ELISA before starting LMWH therapy and 15 days later. Results: At baseline, ASPT gave an unequivocal positive response (20 mm mean wheal diameter), whereas ASST was negative; prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 value was 833 pmol/l (normal range 69/229 pmol/l) and D-dimer value was 27.15 nmol/l (normal range 0.50Y4.00 nmol/l) confirming an activation of the coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis. LMWH therapy (enoxaparin 4000 UI twice a day sc) was started. After few days CU improved and the patient stopped anti-H1 and steroid therapy, without recurrence of CU. Fifteen days later the patient was still asymptomatic, while receiving only LMWH therapy. APST became negative and we observed a marked reduction of both prothrombin fragment F1+2 (287 pmol/l) and D-dimer (2.84 nmol/l Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) are known cause of angioedema. Its incidence is between 0.1% and and 2.2%, but its clinical relevance is due to risk of life-threatening involvement of upper respiratory tract. In the present study we reported the clinical features of patients complaining of ACE-Is-angioedema referred to our Unit in a 5 year period. In a subgroup of them we studied the potential mast-cell involvement by measuring serum tryptase. Methods: Descriptive, observational on ACE-Is-induced angioedema during a 5-year period (January 2001Y December 2006 . Serum tryptase level was evaluated by ELISA assay during the angioedema attacks, and in baseline conditions in three different groups: Group 1 = 12 patients complaining of previous ACE-Is angioedema; Group 2 = 15 patients with previous non-ACE-Is angioedema; Group 3 = 10 patients treated with ACE-Is without angioedema. Results: We observed 32 patients (19 male; mean age 62.3 yrs, range 42 Y 88 yrs) with ascertained ACE-I-induced angioedema. Only one patient was African, whereas the other were white. Patients reported an average of 3.8 attacks of angioedema (range 1Y 9). Upper respiratory tract involvement was observed in 2 subjects. Eleven patients reported a concomitant use of NSAIDs or aspirin (five at low dosage). One patient reported previous cough due to ACE-Is. Drugs responsable were: lisinopril (7), fosinopril (7), enalapril (6), quinalapril (6), rampril (4), captopril (2) .",

Besides the deficiency or malfunction of plasma C1-inhibitor as cause of HAE, bradykinin is considered to be a key mediator of symptoms in HAE attacks.

Results: The patient treated in our hospital was a 22 year old, otherwise healthy male with known HAE since the age of 6 month. He has been having frequent attacks about twice per month which usually were treated with tranexamic acid. The patient experienced in total 11 attacks (7 abdominal, 2 cutaneous and 2 laryngeal) with an average duration of 4 days during the last 6 months. The patient came to the clinic with a severe cutaneous edema of his genitals. He received one single injection of 30 mg Icatibant sc. The onset of symptom relief was reached rapidly after approximately 10 minutes. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred within 5 hours, so the patient could leave the hospital. Icatibant was well tolerated, only mild injection site reactions such as pruritus were observed. No systemic adverse events were observed. Conclusion: In the present case Icatibant provided fast and complete resolution of severe cutaneous HAE symptoms and was well tolerated. The treatment course of the HAE attack in our case complies with the results of the double blind phase of the FAST-2 trial.

However, reports of intermittent urticaria and angio-oedema due to the daily 80 mg intake of acetylsalicylic acid are not common. Methods: We have seen 4 patients (56y old man, 64y old man, 77y old woman and a 79y old woman) who used a daily dose of 80 mg acetylsalicylic acid for more than 6 weeks. They complained about multiple episodes of swelling of the tongue, cheeks and urticaria. The frequency varied from once a week or once in 2Y4 weeks, within a period of 6 to 12 months. Some patients consulted a dermatologist and another physician without any results. Routine screening investigations were negative. Results: The symptoms disappeared in 3Y6 weeks after they stop taking acetylsalicylic acid and taking clopidogrel instead.",

Overall efficacy and tolerability were assessed as Bgood/excellent[ by 75% and 68% of patients, respectively. At least 60% of all patients and 75% of those with moderate/severe symptoms reported complete recovery or marked improvement of any individual allergic symptom. 65% of subjects reported the onset of action as very rapid or rapid. Levo was reported as better than their previous therapy by 72% of patients. Good to excellent improvement in quality of sleep and daily activities was reported by 61% and 74% of patients without concomitant medications, respectively. Global satisfaction with Levo was high for both physicians and patients (VAS=7.4). Most frequently reported AEs were somnolence (7%) and fatigue (3%). Conclusion: We conclude that the intake of low dose acetylsalicylic acid may have caused urticaria and angio-oedema in these patients. The reason behind the attack of urticaria and angio-oedema that only happened in once a week or once in the 2Y4 weeks is still unclear. The intermittent nature of urticaria and angio-oedema attacks may also be the reason why many physicians are not aware that the daily 80 mg dose of acetylsalicycic acid may cause of this problem. We suggest replacing the daily 80 mg use of acetylsalicylic acid with clopidogrel, for those patients with urticaria and angio-oedema possibly caused by acetylsalicylic acid.",

Background: In 50Y80% of patients with chronic urticaria (CU) the origin of disease is unknown. In most of CU cases autoimmune mechanisms are involved. In CU patients auto antibodies such as aDNA, p-ANCA, ANF, RF often detected along with the clinical manifestations of autoimmune pathology (arthralgia, myalgia, photodermatitis, sub febrile body temperature). Predisposition to autoimmune diseases is connected to certain variants of HLA genes. Relative risk index Q2 demonstrates that individuals bearing this HLA gene variant have higher risk of autoimmune pathology development than other individuals. The goal of the study was to investigate association between certain HLA specifities and CU development. Methods: In our study patients were divided into 3 groups. First grouppatients with acute atopic urticaria (N = 30), second group -patients with CU with clinical manifestations of autoimmune pathology (N = 31), third groupnormal individuals (N = 135). HLA-genotyping was performed with SSPvariant of PCR. Results: In the first group half of chronic CU cases revealed from childhood. Weals persisted less than 6 hours in all cases, atopic background in 37% of cases, 100% efficacy of AH drugs application. In the second group: urticaria debut at the age of 24 to 51,urticaria persistence for 2Y4 years in average, existence of autoimmune pathology manifestation in reumo-tests. In the second group statistically significant increase of autoantibodies was found in comparison to the first group. According to HLA-genotyping data patients with CU demonstrated statistically significant increase in the level of HLA DRB1*04 in comparison to normal individuals.",

Patients aged Q18 yr and of either gender, with a Q6 week history of CIU were eligible. Patients had to have wheals present for Q3 days/week, and pruritus, wheals and overall CIU severity scores had to be Q2 (0=none to 3= severe). At baseline and days 8, 15, and 29 patients rated the severity of pruritus, wheal size/number, total CIU symptoms, interference with sleep and daily activities and overall CIU condition using a 4-point scale. QOL was assessed at the same time-points using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). At day 29 the global response to therapy was rated (1=complete relief to 5= treatment failure); adverse events (AE) that occurred during the trial were collected and rated for severity/relation to study drug. Results: The study included 460 subjects (54.1% female), with a mean age of 37.2 years and a mean duration of diagnosed CIU of 25.7 months. Pruritus, wheal size, wheal number, total CIU score, interference with sleep and daily activities and overall condition of CIU were all significantly improved from baseline at days 8, 15 and 29 (P G 0.0001 for all). DLQI also improved significantly from baseline over the course of the study (P G 0.0001). The percentage of patients with complete or marked relief of CIU rose from 64.8% at day 8 to 80.3% at day 15 and 82.3% at day 29. DL was well tolerated and no serious AEs were observed. The most frequent AEs rated as possibly/probably related to treatment were drowsiness (3.7%), fatigue (1.7%), headache (1.5%), thirst (1.5%) and dizziness (1.3%). Conclusion: This practice-based study in Chinese subjects confirms that DL is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of CIU and is associated with improved QOL.",

Background: Chronic prophylactic therapies for hereditary angioedema (HAE) have existed for some time but in the United States acute therapies are lacking. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has been used to treat acute attacks but its use is controversial because reports of FFP worsening HAE symptoms exist. Methods: Twenty-three patients with HAE answered survey questions regarding past experiences with FFP. The purpose of the survey was to determine whether FFP administration during acute HAE attacks ever lead to a worsening of symptoms. Additionally, patients were asked whether FFP was perceived to be beneficial. Demographic data and data on the types of attacks treated was also collected. Results: Six of 23 patients received FFP for acute attacks and an additional three patients received FFP for surgical or dental prophylaxis. Greater than 71 acute attacks were treated with FFP. One individual accounted for approximately 50 treatments. Attack locations included abdominal, peripheral, facial, genital, and laryngeal. There were no episodes of acute worsening after administration of FFP or spread to the larynx. There was perceived benefit from FFP in all but five instances. Conclusion: Until more specific therapies for the acute treatment of HAE are widely available, FFP should be considered as a treatment option particularly in non-laryngeal attacks.",

Results: The two most striking matters of HAE spontaneous course in our patients comparing to literature data before androgenic therapy are, firstly a very low mortality rate (about 5% versus 30%) and secondly, only few of them (less than 10%) had developed moderate attack following dental care even without preventive drug. Conclusion: Our population seems to be more resistant to C1 inhibitor deficiency than European and American patients. We suppose that treated patients would become more sensitive to minor disorders than non treated ones, and also this difference could be due to environmental factor (s) such as microbes.",

After that the same sensibility was determined on 30th minutes, 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th and 24th hour. Results: The suppressive effect of Cetirinax\\ set in 30th minutes and is highest marked in 3rd hour on the erythema and in 9th hour on the papula. The difference were statistic important compared to basic size of papula and erythema. Depression of erythema was equal like papula in various hours. Depressive effect was marked clearly in 24th hour.We determined that histamine papula and erythema were similar at patients independently ages, sex, and clinic condition. The clinic effect correlates to the excellent suppressive functions. Conclusion: Cetirinax\\ is a medicine with excellent quality on the skin reactivity. Background: The impact of childhood asthma on the health care system is considerable. As one of the most chronic diseases of children, asthma is frequent caused for emergency room visits and hospitals admissions. Clinical observations indicate that atopic diseases, particularly bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis are also common in Saudi Arabia. However, there were no formal studies until recently on the prevalence and etiology of childhood asthma in the country. Methods: Prevalence of Bronchial Asthma in school children were studied in different part of the country using a standardized protocol of 32 questionnaires. The questionnaire was designed by a committee of international expert and first used in 1985Y1986, before ISAAC launched its first phase of limited age prevalence studies. Our questionnaires, however is very similar to ISAAC questionnaires but include children from 06 to 16 years of age. For comparative purposes, we have continued using the same protocol for other parts of the country. The questionnaires were translated in local language and distributed through the Ministry of Primary Education to different urban schools of the Kingdom. Results: Their studies were completed at different intervals within the past several years. The combined data revealed varying prevalence of asthma with highest 24% being in a coastal city bordering Yemen called Gizan (n = 362) followed by Taif 23% (n = 594) and Hail 22% (n = 507) an agricultural city. The prevalence rate of asthma for other places where Al-Gazim 16% (n = 384), Abha 13% (n = 485), Dammam 12% (n = 889), Hofuf 14% (n = 923), Jeddah 12% (n = 531) and Riyadh 10% (n = 988). The prevalence for allergic rhinitis was much higher than asthma. Conclusion: Bronchial Asthma emerged to be one of the prevalent diseases in Saudi Arabia and showed regional diversity. The socio-economic differences between asthmatic and non asthmatic children were none striking. Environmental and geographical influences were considered to be the reasons of the variations in the rate of prevalence. Aim: A negative association between the number of siblings and older siblings especially with allergic diseases symptoms through the impact of infections on Th1/Th2 immune response is suggested. The study was aimed to examine the influence of the presence of siblings and the presence of older siblings on asthma in young adolescents. Materials and Methods: The self-reported data by 5507 adolescents aged 12/ 16 years from 8 cities in The Republic of Macedonia obtained through the ISAAC phase 3 questionnaires on asthma and environmental risk factors in 2006 were analysed. The presence of siblings and older siblings separately (adjusted for sex, passive smoke exposure at home, gas/wood cooking at home, wood/coal/oil heating at home, duration of TV watching daily, cat ownership) were correlated to wheeze ever, current wheeze, current speechlimiting wheeze, exercise-induced wheeze and ever-diagnosed asthma. Odds ratios (OR, 95% CI) in binary logistic regression were performed for statistical analysis of data. Results: A significant association of the presence of siblings in general and the presence of older siblings especially with asthma and its symptoms was not found (p 9 0.05 for all the parameters). Conclusion: It seems that the presence of siblings and older siblings do not influence asthma in young adolescents.",

Purpose: Asthma is a major public health problem in Bangladesh. Allergy plays an important role in asthma. Asthmatics tend to be more atopic and thus more allergic skin test reactivity than non-asthmatics. Hence skin prick test may serve as a useful adjunct in the diagnosis and management of bronchial asthma. Results of Skin Prick Test are an important component in the formulation of preventive plan for the management of bronchial asthma. Methods: This was a prospective case control study carried out in the Asthma Centre, National Institute of Disease of the Chest and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 90 bronchial asthma patients were taken as case and 80 subjects having no history of asthma or allergy were taken as control. The mean age of cases was 25.06 T 1.28 with male female ratio 1.57: 1 and of control 23.09 T 1.31 with male female ratio 1 , positive skin test was detected in mite (7.50%), House dust (5%), Cockroach (2.5%), Mosquito (3.75%), Ladies finger (2.5%), Tomato (1.25%), Chicken (2.5%), Egg white (1.25%) and Prawn (5%) In control non-allergic subjects' 1.25%Y7.5% shows positive skin test result. Cause of this positive reaction in non-allergic control may be due to differences in selection of subjects, standardization of extracts and recording of results. Conclusion: Skin allergy test is the most sensitive method for detecting specific IgE antibody. Positive skin test along with clinical relevance determined the consideration of asthmatic patient for immunotherapy. High prevalence of positive immediate hypersensitivity skin test reactions in the asthmatics population is a strong argument that it should be included in the initial evaluation of patients with asthma. Identification of allergen by positive skin test may help in the preventive plan for the management of bronchial asthma patients.",

Control group included 25 age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Results: The aortal stiffness in asthma exacerbation was significant more, than in healthy persons.

IA in such patients a 6 fold surpassed control level and was 14,4 T 5,8%. Significant raised (8 G 0,001) arterial stiffness can take part in increasing cardiovascular risk during asthma exacerbation. Independently of increasing arterial stiffness in asthma exacerbation, aPWV and IA essentially improved and came nearer to control level in asthma remission. That suggests functional character of these changes. Augmented arterial stiffness in asthma correlates to lung ventilation dysfunction and hypoxia, disease duration and severity.

Objective: The aim of the study was to assess sensitization to common inhalant allergens among adult patients with asthma associated with allergic rhinitis (AR) and to find a relationship with the medication and the duration of asthma/AR Methods: A screening survey questionnaire including questions assessing prevalence of symptoms of asthma over 12 months and questions relating 24 months prevalence of AR symptoms, were distributed to 763 of 16Y87 year old (median age 46 yr) patients presented in the outpatients department during of 1 years. The response rate was 83%. Asthmatic patients were diagnosed according to the GINA definition of asthma. AR was diagnosed due to the clinical symptoms (sneezing, itching, rhinorhoea, nasal congestion) and sensitization to allergens. Results: Hypersensitivity to inhalant allergens (house dust mite, animal dander, pollen) was assessed by skin prick test (positive: 9 3 mm) in 32 responders having a clinical history. 73% of patients with asthma and 64% with AR were sensitized to house dust mites (D.pteronyssinus and D.farinae). Hypersensitivity documented by positive skin prick test in patients with asthma and AR was noted to pollen in 47% and 49%, to cat and dog dander in 27% and 11%, respectively.",

Background: Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic disease associated with elevated IgE levels. It was demonstrated that IL-13, as well as IL-4, plays a crucial role in the regulation of IgE production. The aim of our study was to reveal the association between C-1055T, Arg130Gln (G + 2044A) IL-13 gene polymorphism and level of total IgE in BA patients. Methods: The polymorphisms in IL-13 gene were analyzed by the PCR-RFLP in 136 asthma patients and 64 healthy control subjects. Results: Total IgE and IL-13 levels were measured by ELISA. The total serum IgE level was found to be elevated in BA patients group: 290(47,5;495) *kU/L, and within normal range in the control group: 25,5(19;100)kU/L. The levels of total IgE in BA patients and healthy donors differ significantly, p G 0,001. The frequency of alleles combination -j1055T and + 2044A is 6.9% and reliably is different from that in the control group (p = 0.008). Studying the influence of the polymorphisms on the total IgE level we revealed that this level was considerably elevated (up to 315(290;1077)kU/L) among the patients with -1055T and +2044A alleles compared with a group who has allele +2044A and j1055C, and the group who has allele +2044G and j1055C. Total IgE level in this groups was 230(200;440)kU/L and 205(190;377)kU/L, respectively. Patient with allele j1055T and +2044G were not identified. The link between disease and studied traits (j1055T and +2044A) determined by the Wolf's coefficient of association , which was 0.9.

Background: Despite its high prevalence, elderly asthma remains unrecognized and misunderstood because its symptoms may not be typical as in young patients. And because other cardiac or respiratory diseases may be frequently associated. Only a few studies on the clinical characteristics of elderly asthma have been reported till now. Methods: To investigate whether the characteristics of elderly asthma were different according to the onset of asthma, one hundred eighty asthmatic patients over the age of 65 were enrolled who attended the Asthma and Allergy Clinic, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Results: Of 180 patients, ninty nine patients have developed asthma over the age of 65. This group with late-onset asthma (LOA) had a mean duration of disease of 3.4 T 3.5 yr. The remaining group with early onset asthma (EOA) had a mean duration of illness of 18.8 T 17.1 yr. These groups were indistinguishable by the symptoms, the medication requirements and the serum level of total IgE. These with EOA had a greater degree of airway obstruction in FEV1 of predicted value (p G 0.028) and a greater likelihood of neutrophils in induced sputum. Moreover, the novel indicator, namely, neutrophil/eosinophil ratio of induced sputum was inversely related to several PFT indices, including FEV1, FEV/FVC, FEF25-75%, and FEF25-75%/FVC. These findings suggest not only eosionphil but also neutrophil could play an important role in the airway inflammation and airflow limitation. Conclusion: Our study sggested that cellular compositions of airway inflammation, and lung function depends on the onset and possibly duration of disease in elderly asthmatics. These findings suggest that early onset and longstanding asthma may lead to chronic persistent airway obstruction and thereby mimic chronic obstructive lung disease.",

UHC, Allergy Department, Tirana, Albania. Background: The provocation test for assesing BHR is time consuming and sometimes impossible to be performed. Does our questionnaire offer an high expectancy for BHR? Does this questionnaire has any practical value, to avoid the provocation test in certain cases? Methods: 200 children 9Y11 years old from Tirana performed bronchial provocation test with 4.5% saline, according ISAAC protocol. These children answered in the same day to our short and original questionnaire of 4 questions: Have you ever had any shortness of breath or cough in these situations: 1-During or after physical effort (gym hour, going up the stairs, etc) 2-In exposure of tobacco smoke? 3-In exposure of car emanations, heating and cooking gases? 4-By laughing loudly? Every positive answer was coded with scores 1,2,3,or 4, with 0 score if no positive answer, and with 5 score if all positive answers. Results: Subjects with positive result of saline provocation (change of FEV1 9 15% pre-post provocation) are divided according the scores 0,1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The same is done for subjects with negative BHR. Not surprisingly, 65% of subjects with negative result after saline provocation had score 0, comparing to 10% of subjects with positive saline, also only 10% of subjects with negative saline resulted with score 5, when more than 50% of subjects positively reacting to saline provocation had score 5. When the subjects with negative result to saline, regardless to result of score questionnaire (nr = 183) are compared with the sub-category of subjects which, beside the negative saline, had also score 5 (nr = 19), we found in the last group a higher rate of personal and familiar history of asthma and allergy. Sensibility, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value of this questionnaire to forecast the BHR are calculated: 60%, 89%, 24% and 97% for the score 5 (presence of all symptoms) and for score 0 (absence of all symptoms). Conclusion: 1-This short questionnaire is able to forecast a negative BHR in 97% of cases, if all symptoms are missing (score 0). 2-Subjects with score 5, regardless the provocation result, have an intriguing clinical profile, with positive personal and familiar history for allergy, requiring more attention by doctors and deeper investigations in the future. 3-By only asking 4 simple questions, the time consuming bronchial provocation test could be avoided in everyday medical practice most of the cases, if all the answers are negative.",

Bronchial asthma is a word-wide problem, with an estimated of 300 million affected individuals. There are more than 200,000 asthmatic patients in our country. Classification of asthma by severity is useful when the doctor has made a decision about management and treatment of a patient. The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain clinical control. Asthma Control Test is one of a validated measurement to analyze the controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled levels of asthma. Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the level of asthma control in our country. Methods: In our outpatient clinic, we studied a group of 133 patients (female: 91, male: 42; mean age: 44y) with bronchial asthma. Asthma Control Test was done by all patients and they also have an other eleven questions regarding smoking habits, asthma medications, side effects, exacerbations, exercise induced dyspnoe. Results: Only 50% of our patients (n = 67 pts) had controlled and partly controlled asthma level, an other 50% (n = 66 pts) had uncontrolled asthma based on Asthma Control Test. The total control level has been achieved only by 18% (n = 24 ) of our patients. There were unable to work and to have a job the 16 % of the patients and 12% were not able to work even in their household because of suffering asthma. Seventy eight % of patients have reduced quality of life. However, 64% of our pts believed and felt they have total asthma control and only 10% of pts subjective opinion were the uncontrolled asthma. Conclusion: In our study, we found that patient's opinion about their own condition of asthma did not correlate to an objective test. Asthma Control Test show us the reality of the level of bronchial asthma. The test is very easy to use even alone by the patient.

Evidence is now mounting that obesity is also a risk factor for asthma. The aim of our study was to assess relation between obesity and asthma severity in children. We conducted cross-sectional study in the out-patient department at M. Guramishvili Pediatric Clinic in 2005Y2006yy. In the study were enrolled 63 children aged 12Y15 with a mean age of 13.75, 41 boys and 22 girls. We used body mass index (BMI) to detect overweight and obesity. Weight categories were defined by BMI number position on BMI-age growth chartrisk of overweight -85th to less than the 95th percentile, obesity -equal to or greater than the 95th percentile. Asthma severity definition was based on patients clinical and/or spirometeric parameters according to GINA guideline. Children with a history of other lung disease were excluded. The prevalence of obesity in our study population was 31.7%. Among girls 55% and among boys only 19.5% were obese. Mean BMI of females with asthma were significantly higher than males (p G 0.0001). The obese children had a difference in baseline asthma classification (more likely to have persistent asthma). Despite similar severity of illness at admission, they had a longer length of stay at hospital (9.8 +/j 7.0 vs. 6.5 +/j 3.4 days, p G 0.01). We can conclude that there is relationship between body weight and asthma severity and obesity may be a potentially modifiable risk factor for asthma or asthma exacerbation. Background: Recent data from animal studies indicate that fat tissue is a source of eotaxin, which may play an important role in asthma. However, the link between obesity and airway inflammation in asthma is not well understood. Objective: We aimed to investigate the impact of obesity on eotaxin levels in patients with stable mild/moderate asthma. Methods: 20 steroid-naive asthmatics (mean age: 57.2 T 2.2 yrs) and 9 control subjects without lung diseases (mean age: 59.4 T 9.7 yrs) were investigated. According to the body mass index (BMI), subjects were divided into the 2 groups: subjects with normal weight (BMI G 25kg/m 2 ) and subjects with overweight (BMI Q 25 kg/m 2 ). Spirometry, bronchial provocation test with methacholine (PD 20 ), sputum induction and bronchoscopy were performed.

Background: Interest in the impact of illness on day to day function is leading investigators to include both disease specific and generic health related quality of life (HR QOL) questionnaires in a broad range of clinical studies and to gain a full picture of the impact of asthma on the lives of children with this condition, it is necessary to make direct measurement of health related quality of life. Methods: In response to this need, we used the Juniper`s pediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire (PAQLQ) and Juniper`s Pediatric Asthma Caregiver`s Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) that has been developed based on guidelines for construction of over a dozen validated disease specific quality of life instruments. The PAQLQ consists of 23 items that in children with asthma have been identified as troublesome in their daily lives and PACQLQ that contains 13 items in two domains of emotional and activities disturbances. The study design consisted of an 18 month single cohort study. Patients participating in the study were 113 children, 7Y17 years of age, with a wide range of asthma severity and their caregivers. For each patient a PAQLQ and for each caregiver a PACQLQ was completed. One week before visit patients recorded morning peak flow rates, medication use and symptoms in a diary. After complete physical examination, for determining of asthma severity, spirometry was performed. Results: The questionnaires after statically analysis showed good levels of both longitudinal and cross sectional correlations with the conventional asthma indices and with general quality of life. We found that consistently QOL in boys were more disturbed than females, a good relevancy between severity of asthma and QOL scores and more disturbances of QOL in caregivers of male asthmatic patients than caregivers of female asthmatic patients. We could not find any significant relevancy between FEV1 percentage of predicted and overall scores of QOL. Conclusion: Smaller airways, and higher airway resistance and more activity of males than females may explain why boys have more disturbed life style than females.",

The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between BMI and asthma, as well as its sex-dependence in young adolescents. Methods: Self-reported data obtained from the standardized International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase Three. Written questionnaires of 5579 young adolescents aged 13Y14 years old from randomly selected private and public schools in Salta and Cordoba (Argentina) were used. The BMI for each individual was calculated; international cut-off points for BMI for overweight and obesity by sex and age were used (Normal: 18 until 24.99 kg/m2, Overweight: 25 until 29.99 kg/m2 and Obesity 9 30 kg/ m2). Because of the very low prevalence of obesity (0.86 %), they were included in the overweight group (4.6%). Each variable of the ecological questionnaire considered as probable confounder was confronted in 2x2 tables with having wheezed in the last 12 months(13,1%) and BMI, and those variables found significantly associated were included in the final analysis. The data were statistically analyzed by the chi-square test, P and odd ratios (OR, 95 % CI) in binary logistic regression. Results: 51,4% of responders were male. Being a boy was associated with overweight (OR 1,35. 95%CI 1,06-1,71; P 0,013), and exercising one or less/ week was associated with obesity (OR 2. 95%CI 1,07-3,70; P 0,025). After adjusting for each one, both were significantly associated to an increased BMI (P 0,02 and 0,01 respectively). Watching TV one or less hour/day was related to have a lower BMI (OR 0,72. 95%CI 0,55-0,93; P 0.01). Exercising once or less per week was the only factor associated to wheezing after adjusting for BMI and sex (P 0.0001). Conclusion: In our population, neither sex nor overweight were associated to wheezing symptoms; however sex was significantly associated with overweight. Maybe the scarce obese population in our cities contributed to these findings, however sedentary profile contributed to an increased BMI and to wheezing symptoms also, as was expected.",

Background: Cabin air quality is important especially to employees with sensitive airways. There are few studies on incidence of asthma and allergy in pilots and cabin crew. The aim of the study was to study the relations between occupational factors and personal factors (age, gender, atopy, smoking habits) and incidence of asthma and allergy. Methods: A standardized questionnaire (\u00d6 rebro, MN040 NA) was answered in 1997 by pilots (n = 577) and cabin attendants (n = 936). Three years later, in 2000 the same questionnaire was sent to pilots (n = 436) and cabin attendants (n = 698) on duty. The new onset of asthma and allergies (three year incidence) were calculated by logistic regression related to personal factors with logistic regression. Results: The prevalences of airway symptoms and asthma were two to three times lower in pilots than in cabin attendants. The three year incidence of doctors diagnosed asthma was 1.2% among pilots, and 0.6% among cabin attendants. The incidence of any airway symptom (wheeze, attacks of breathlessness) was 4.6% among pilots, and 12.5% among cabin attendants. The incidence of chronic bronchitis (daily productive cough) was 1.1% among pilots, and 3.5% among cabin attendants. Further, the incidence of pollen allergy and furry pet allergy was 5.4%, and 1.6% respectively among pilots and 5.7% and 2.4% respectively among cabin attendants. The incidence of food allergy/ intolerance was 1.8% among pilots and 3.2% among cabin attendants. The incidence of airway symptoms was lower in pilots (p G 0.05). The incidence of doctors diagnosed asthma and food allergy was higher in atopics (p G 0.01). Younger cabin crew and pursers had a higher incidence of pollen-/ furry pet allergy (p G 0.01). No relations was seen as to gender and own tobacco smoking. Conclusion: Age, atopy, and type of occupation was related to the incidence of asthma and self-reported allergies. The incidence of doctors diagnosed asthma among pilots (0.4%/year) was somewhat higher than expected. Airway symptoms in genral were two to three times more common among cabin attendants. The study started before the stop of smoking on intercontinal flights. ",

Objective: To evaluate the importance of the genetic background on the prevalence of asthma (A), rhinoconjunctivitis (R) and atopic eczema (AE) among AD born in Brazil and from different genetic backgrounds. Methods: ISAA\u0106 s written questionnaire was applied to two groups of 12Y15year-old AD of similar socioeconomic status living in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo: Brazilian (N = 381) and Japanese (third generation, born in Brazil, from families without mixed marriages, N = 221). Affirmative response to BHave had wheezing in the last year^identified AD with A, to BNasal and ocular symptoms in the last year^those with R, and to BEczema in the last year evidenced in flexural areas^those with AE. Questions^Speech problem in last 12 months during acute attack^, BNasal symptoms interfering with daily activities^, and BKept awake at night by this itchy rash in the last 12 months\u0109 haracterized severity of A, R, and AE respectively. Results: There were no differences according to gender in both groups except for the prevalence of R that was higher among Brazilian females. The prevalence of A (12.7% x 19.4%, p G 0.05) and the prevalence of R (10.4% x 24.4%, p G 0.05) were higher between Brazilian AD when compared to Japanese AD, respectively. There were no difference in A severity (0% x 1.1%) but R`s severity was significantly higher between Brazilian AD (10.4% x 24.4%, p G 0.05). The prevalence of AE was higher between Japanese AD (7.7% x 3.1%, p G 0.05) but without differences in its severity (1.8% x 1.8%, p 9 0.05). The prevalence of these diseases is not different from those observed in Japan and in S\u00e3o Paulo (ISAAC, phase 3). Conclusion: The prevalence observed among the third generation of Japanese AD without miscegenation born in Brazil, showed similar results to those obtained in ISAAC phase 3 recently published in Japan. Considering that both AD groups evaluated have been exposed to the same environment we might speculate that the genetic background in this Japanese population is more important than environmental influences on the development of asthma and allergic diseases.",

Methods: Researchers from 11 university hospital have established asthma cohort named 'Cohort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea' (COREA) since year of 2005 in Korea, which will be continued up to 2013. We have collected patients having chronic persistent respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, sputum or wheezing more than 3 months and airflow limitation by FEV1/FVC less than 0.7 or AHR confirmed by methacholine bronchial provocation test (MBPT). As the first study of our cohort, we analyzed various clinical factors influencing on the severity of asthma for registered 644 patients at the time of first-visit. Severity was assessed by special allergists by the definition of 2002 GINA guideline. Results: Severity of asthma was associated with skin prick test positivity (p G 0.006), history of hospital visit due to asthma exacerbation (p = 0.001), symptom onset (p = 0.037) and duration of diagnosis (p = 0.041). Severity also was significantly correlated with FVC, FEV1, and bronchodilator response (all p G 0.001). However, smoking didn't affect the severity of asthma, even in case of passive smoking. :",

Our demographics situation are similar to the rest of Latin America, with a young and mostly urban population living under variable conditions of poverty; application of massive vaccination programs and other public health measures will ensue that non-communicable diseases occupy major roles in the near future. For Venezuela ISAAC data shows an eighteen percent of wheezing in the past year with an overall prevalence of thirty two percent is reported. Methods: In order to explore such previous high prevalence, we carried out a multidisciplinary and ongoing study (approved by the ethical committee of the Institute of Biomedicine, ratified by the academic council of the medical Faculty of Central University of Venezuela) in 1000 unselected school children, 6Y12 years old, from low to middle socioeconomic background covering different areas from Caracas, Venezuela. After an informed consent was signed from parents or guardians, all children from randomly selected schools were evaluated with a validated modified Graffar's socioeconomic questionnaire and an allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis validated questionnaire after ARIA, GINA and Hannifin criteria; skin prick testing (ALK-ABELLO) for common food and inhalant allergens plus total IgE (ELISA), complete blood count (COULTER) and serial feces examination for ova and parasites were performed in all children. Pre and post bronchodilator FEV1 and PEF spirometric measurements values were obtained (MICROLOOP), and included in data analysis. Results: We found that 60% of the child evaluated had allergic rhinitis, 40% had asthma, and 21.9% Atopic Dermatitis with or without other allergic pathologies. We also found that 64.8% of the child evaluated had parasites and 41.1 had respiratory infectious disease associated. Conclusion: Our data confirms the high prevalence of allergic diseases in Venezuela employing questionnaires, a clinical exam and immune diagnostic evaluation methodology. Hence, our health system and medical faculties should be highly aware of these and similar findings for establish a proper education programs, both at primary health care personnel and also in communities. Developing nations are waiting for simpler but effective approaches in the management of a public health problem who`s time has come.",

Background: Large international studies on asthma and allergies in childhood have found notorious variation in prevalence and temporal trend among countries. However, there is no international studies on the epidemiologic characteristics of wheezing in the first year of life. The aim of this study is to validate a questionnaire to assess the prevalence of recurrent wheezing infants. Methods: This study was undertaken in pediatric emergency rooms (PER). A randomized sample of parents visiting PER for lower respiratory illness, answered a questionnaire on wheezing developed by the International Study of Wheezing in Infants (EISL, from spanish Estudio Internacional de Sibilancias en Lactantes). During visit, all infants were examined by one of the authors (blind) who reported, or not, the presence of wheezing on chest auscultation. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value, predictive negative value and concordance (0) level were calculated from parent and physician reports. Results: Two hundred and nine infants aged 12 to 15 months participated in the study. Fifty six parents reported current wheezing and 43 were confirmed by physician; 153 parents did not report current wheezing and 146 had not wheezes at physical examination (0 = 0,74, CI 95% 0,64 Y 0,85). This questionnaire showed high sensitivity (86%), specificity (91,8%), positive predictive value (76,8%) and predictive negative value (95,4%). Conclusion: Regardless of previous experience with wheezing episodes, parents can reliably inform when their infants are currently wheezing. A simple and convenient questionnaire confirmed by physical examination produce an accurate tool to asses the prevalence of asthma symptoms in infants.",

Background: The recognition of clear seasonal (monthly) patterns of Asthma Exacerbations (AE) in a particular area may allow preventive strategies to be developed. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the seasonal (monthly) variation in AE in patients with allergic and non-allergic asthma. Methods: Data were obtained from our department in Athens, between October 1986 and September 2006 (240 months). We evaluated all AE occurring this period for patients with Allergic Asthma (AA) and Non-Allergic Asthma (N-AA). The diagnosis and classification in AA and N-AA were made according to the results of skin prick testing (SPT) to common aeroallergens. Patients with AA defined as those with 9 1 positive SPTand patients with N-AA defined as those with negative SPT. A positive SPTwas defined as a wheal size at least 3 mm greater than the negative control. AE were defined as a deterioration in asthma resulting in an unscheduled visit (i.e patient-initiated) leading to change in asthma treatment or the need for oral steroids for 9 3 days and/or emergency room visit/hospitalization.

A decrease in AE occurred in the rest of the months with a nadir in August (j79,6%). Although AE may be triggered by a number of other factor (i.e respiratory viral infections), this study suggests that asthmatic patients allergic to mites represent a seasonal (monthly) variation in AE, in Greece. These results may offer significant opportunities for improve disease management. Conclusion: In Sverdlovsk region BA is spread in the urban area wider than in the rural region. The BA atopic form prevailes both in urban and rural areas. In the city the important asthma RF are bad factors in production facilities and presence of cockroaches and birds. Asthma RF common for urban and rural areas are: allergic rhinitis, a strain of asthma and allergy, presence of fish aquariums in living houses/ apartments.",

Background: Although a significant incidence of various psychological variables has been recognized for a long time in asthmatic children, its true role is the subject of strong controversies. Stress, suggestion and external conditioning can affect the respiratory tract. The chronic aspect of the disease, its disruptive effects on the quality of life and the sensation of threat to their life, can condition the appearance of different psychosocial alterations in the patient, or in their immediate family environment. Experimental tests have shown that the severity of the disease, multiple hospitalizations and the absence of specific IgE mediated symptoms, upon exposure to allergens, could contribute to increased emotional disorders in children. Objective: To search for an efficient intervention procedure which includes the improvement of these children in school and personal, familial and social adaptation, and to help them modify their inadequate attributions and attitudes towards their disease. Materials and Methods: This was a random stratified prospective study including a population of 168 pediatric patients with ages comprised between 9 and 11 years of age (100 boys and 68 girls); 74 had asthma, 56 rhinitis and 38 asthma and rhinitis.

The following tests were used: multifactorial autoevaluation test for infantile adaptation (TAMA), questionnaire for attributions and attitudes toward the disease (ATAC), and a questionnaire for the evaluation of the physical aspects of the disease (EVEO). The program applied to the case group consisted of an emotional/instructive program (PIE_ASA). Results: The psychotherapeutic approach to the treatment of these asthmatic children using the program PIE_ASA achieved a global improvement of the children, fulfilling the objectives of the program. The modification of the negative attributions and attitudes towards their disease was accomplished. No changes in other attitudes such as increase food intake and compliance with medication were obtained. Better results were obtained in boys than in girls, regarding social and school adaptation aspects. However, girls showed a reduction in the number of emergency room visits. Conclusion: We believe that the use of this type of evaluation en asthmatic children is recommended, since it contributes to an overall improvement in the asthmatic symptoms of children.",

In spite of strict avoidance of these foods, he had recurrent episodes of anaphylaxis during exercise (jogging). When he was reevaluated he recognized he used to smoke marijuana cigarettes very often, sometimes before exercise. 2 years before this evaluation he begun presenting sudden onset rhinoconjuctivitis each time he smoked a marijuana cigarette. He gave up marijuana smoking; since then he hasn\u00e1t had any other anaphylactic reactions. He has been jogging, eating cereals before exercising, without any problem for more than one year. Methods: Skin tests (prick-prick test) with fresh Cannabis sativa leaves, skin tests to a leave extract, IgE immunoblotting to a Cannabis sativa leaves extract. Results: Skin tests were positive, while they were negative in 10 controls On the immunoblotting, the patient's IgE recognized a 35 KD band. Conclusion: We report here the first case of exercise-induced anaphylaxis in which the trigger is the inhalation of Cannabis sativa smoke. The skin tests and in vitro results, as well as the clinical picture and evolution after smoke cessation are consistent with a BCannabis sativa smoke dependent, exerciseinduced anaphylaxis[, in a patient that also has a IgE mediated immediate rhinoconjuctivitis due to marijuana smoking. The mechanisms of the anaphylactic reaction are obscure; there are a few previous reports that confirm that Cannabis sativa smoking can cause immediate hypersensitivity symptoms, like bronchospasm, rhinoconjuctivitis or generalized itching in sensitized individuals, but to our knowledge there are no previous reports of an exercise-induced reaction that appears to be dependent on marijuana smoking.",

Siriraj Hospital, Allergy and Immunology of Pediatrics Department, Bangkok, Thailand. Background: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction, and foods are one of the most common culprits. Serum tryptase is marker of mast cell activation and could use to confirm anaphylaxis to shrimp. Objective: To determine the utility of serum tryptase in the diagnosis of shrimp-induced anaphylaxis. Methods: Twenty-one patients with previous allergic reaction from shrimp were recruited into a prospective study for shrimp challenge. Twelve patients developed mild allergic reaction and nine patients developed anaphylaxis. Serum tryptase were obtained before shrimp challenge and 1 hour after the onset of symptoms. Results: In both groups of patients, median tryptase levels were significantly elevated after the onset of shrimp challenge as compared to baselines (baseline tryptase -1.08, peak tryptase -2.33 2g/L in anaphylaxis group; baseline tryptase -1.49, peak tryptase 1.56 2g/L in non-anaphylaxis group, p G 0.05). The delta tryptase (peak minus baseline) values in the anaphylaxis group was significantly higher than non-anaphylaxis group (1.33 VS 0.125 2g/L, p = 0.0004). The tryptase ratio (peak divided by baseline) values in the anaphylaxis group was also significantly higher than non-anaphylaxis group (2.11 VS 1.055, p = 0.0001). Using the recommended cut-off range (peak tryptase G 12.0 2g/L) the sensitivity of such cut-off was 0.11 with specificity of 1.0. Conclusion: We recommend using serial tryptase values, including tryptase ratio and/or delta tryptase values, for the diagnosis of food-induced anaphylaxis. The latter two values may be helpful than peak serum tryptase.",

The aim of this study was to describe common clinical characteristics, laboratory manifestations and natural history of the disease. Methods: Children with history of wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis were identified. Skin prick test and specific IgE for wheat were done. A three-day challenge program including open challenge for wheat, exercise and exercise challenge test after a meal containing wheat was performed. Results: Five children, aged 5-14 years (mean: 8 + 3.74 years) were evaluated. Atopic history was found in 40% of patients. All patients had symptoms involved skin and respiratory systems and two had hypotension. Sera specific IgE for wheat were determined in 3 patients among which two were positive. Three patients completed the three-day protocol. Anaphylaxis occurred in 2 out of 3 patients with the amount of wheat consumed prior to exercise being more than 100 grams. Conclusion: Wheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis is more common in male. Skin and respiratory symptoms are major manifestations. A three-day wheat challenge protocol is a definitive diagnostic tool. However the amount of wheat required for challenging should be high.",

Patients and Methods: A retrospective review of medical records spanning 10 years (May 1997-May 2007) allowed us to obtain data of 127 patients who where derived to the Allergy and Immunology Department of the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile with a diagnosis of anaphylaxis of unknown origin. Three patients were excluded from this study, two with diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis and the other with hereditary angioedema. We evaluated: sex, age, number of episodes before consulting, interval between first and last episode, history of atopy, time elapsed between exposure to the suspected triggering factor and the appearance of symptoms, form of presentation, severity of the reaction, treatment received and clinical/laboratory work up. Results: 127 patients, 48 men and 79 women, were included. Age ranged from 11 months to 81 years, with a mean of 27.5 years; 61% were atopic. The average delay before consulting was 4 years, and median number of previous episodes was 2. Etiology was identified in 83% of cases; the main causes were drugs (31%), followed by foods (27%) and Hymenoptera stings (16%). The average time of onset of symptoms was 42 minutes post-exposure. Ninety six percent of patients presented urticaria and/or angioedema and severe manifestations (Grade III and IV) were seen in 70% of the individuals. From the individuals who had indication of management with epinephrine, only 42.1% received it in the Emergency room. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the Chilean patients with anaphylaxis are similar to those reported in other countries. It is relevant to emphasize the great percentage of atopics patients in our series as well as the delay in the consultation.",

Immunology, Asthma & Allergy Research Institute, Immunology Department, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. Background: Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment. We report common findings of the first case series of anaphylaxis in Iran, which carried out in children who referred to the center of Immunology, Asthma and Allergy. Materials and Methods: Children referred to the clinic of allergy with a previous diagnosis of anaphylaxis were considered in this study (2003 -2006) . A specific questionnaire was completed for all of the patients and a detailed clinical history and demographic data were recorded. For all of the patients, Skin prick tests and specific IgE measurement were performed for suspected allergens. Determination of causative allergen was based on patients' history and IgE mediated tests. Challenge test was not performed for any patient. Results: 39 children ages ranged from 1m to 13 year old with a previous diagnosis of anaphylaxis were referred to the clinic of allergy during 2 years. (48/1% male and 24/1% female respectively). Skin prick tests was positive in 78/9% and specific IgE was positive in 88/2%. The most probable causative agents in this population were foods (92/40%). Milk (55/ 6%) and wheat (18/5%) were the most frequent causes of anaphylaxis in this study.58% of children had more than 2 episodes of anaphylaxis in their life; also 6 cases of multifactorial food anaphylaxis were identified for the first time. The most common causative allergen for recurrence anaphylaxis was milk in 20 patients Dermatologic signs and symptoms were the most common (92/2%) vs. 76/%, 62/5%, 21/6%, 20/8% for respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular signs and symptoms, respectively. Flushing was seen in 66/7%, prurities in 56/9%, urticaria in 54/9%, preorbital edema in 52/1% of patients, rash in 50%, erythema in 43/1% and angioedema in 41/2%. Conclusion: These data confirm that foods specially milk and wheat are the most common causes of anaphylaxis in children and dermatologic signs and symptoms are the most common finding, thus parents and physicians should be educated to recognize the most common causative allergens and common presenting clinical manifestation of this disease to avoid the progression of this life threatening syndrome and be able to manage anaphylactic patients.",

Methods: Twenty-two consecutive patients observed in our department from June 2006 to May 2007 with a suggestive clinical history of food anaphylaxis were selected. Foods involved in the severe systemic reactions were identified and atopic co-morbidities, occurrence of anaphylaxis in the study period and the medication used were investigated. A standardized questionnaire and skin prick tests to airborne allergens (mites, moulds, cockroach, cat and dog dander, pollens, feathers, latex) and food allergens (egg, milk, seafood, mammals and birds meat, fruits, nuts, cereals, legumes, spices and other vegetables) were performed. Serum specific IgE to airborne and food allergens and/or prick-to-prick with natural food extracts were done in selected cases (if there was evidence of clinical reactivity). Results: All the patients selected had a past history of an immediate severe systemic reaction after ingestion of food. The mean age of the population studied was 37T10 years. Fourteen patients were female. The mean age at the first anaphylaxis episode was 24T11 years. Foods involved were fruits in 4 patients, crustaceans in 4 patients, cow's milk in 4 patients, nuts in 3 patients, legumes in 2 patients, cereals in 2 patients, fish in 2 patients and egg in 1 patient. All patients were sensitised to the culprit food. Sensitisation to airborne allergens occurred in 19 patients (10 to mites, 7 to grasses, 5 each to weeds and trees, 3 to latex and 1 each to cockroach, dog dander and feathers). Sensitisation to more than 1 food occurred in 16 patients. Eighteen patients had atopic co-morbidities related to airborne allergens (12 patients had asthma). Recurrence of anaphylaxis occurred in 2 patients with cow's milk allergy in the study period. Self-administered adrenaline was used by 1 patient twice. Conclusion: In the population studied a high proportion of atopic asthmatic patients was found. Different plant and animal foods were implicated. Hidden milk allergens can be extremely difficult to avoid and this fact could explain the recurrence of anaphylaxis in 2 cow's milk allergic patients, in spite of a strictly restrictive diet.",

Background: Mast cells play an important role in allergic reaction, host defense, local homeostasis, inflammation and angiogenesis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mast cell numbers and different types of periodontal diseases. Methods: Gingival specimens were taken from 20 moderate to advanced chronic periodontal and 19 moderate to advanced aggressive periodontal sites as case groups and 18 healthy/gingivitis sites as control group in routine periodontal surgeries (flap and crown lengthening) and were examined after toluidine-blue staining for mast cells counting and hematoxylin-eosin staining for assessing inflammation. Inflammatory and mast cells in 5 micron sections were assessed by two observers 3 times, utilizing light microscope at 100X and 400X magnification. ANOVA and T tests with an alpha error level less than 5 percent were used to analyze data. Results: Mast cells numbers were higher in chronic versus aggressive periodontitis and healthy/gingivitis (p=0.000). The aggressive periodontitis didn't have more numbers of mast cells as compared to healthy/ gingivitis (p90.05). There were no relationship between mast cell numbers and degree of inflammation in 3 groups. Conclusion: The present study indicates more mast cell numbers presence in the chronic periodontitis sites than other sites. The results of this study suggest more studies to evaluate dynamic aspects of host defense in conjunct with other aspects of immune system, simultaneously.",

University of Alberta, Department of Medicine, Edmonton, Canada. Background: Mast cells (MC) are important effector cells in allergic and inflammatory responses through secretion of various mediators following activation. Nitric oxide (NO) is important signaling molecule that regulates MC function. It can depress MC allergic responses such as leukotriene (LT), cytokine and chemokine production, as well as MC degranulation. However, the involvement of NO in prostaglandin (PG) D 2 production, an important lipid mediator produced in MC, is unclear. In PG synthesis, cyclooxygenase (COX) is an important enzyme and two isozymes of COX, constitutively expressed COX-1 and inducible COX-2, have been reported. It is well established that mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) exhibit biphasic PGD 2 biosynthesis; COX-1-dependent immediate and COX-2dependent delayed PGD 2 production, when BMMC are stimulated with SCF, IL-10 and IL-1$. Methods: The effects of NO on COX-2 expression and PGD 2 generation in BMMC were investigated using NO-donors, S-Nitrosoglutathione (SNOG) and S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). PGD 2 production by stimulated BMMC was assayed using PGD 2 -MOX enzyme immunoassay kits. Western blot and real-time RT-PCR were used to measure COX-2 protein and mRNA expression. Results: Exogenous NO augmented COX-2 protein expression and increased COX-2-dependent PGD 2 generation in response to SCF, IL-10 and IL-1$. The increased expression of COX-2 by NO-donors was reduced by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190. Downstream of p38 MAPK, NO-donors augmented not only COX-2 mRNA transcription but also its stability. By contrast, NO-donors did not affect COX-1 protein expression. However, in contrast to the augmentation of COX-2 expression and activity, SNOG (100 to 500 6M), but not SNAP (up to 500 6M) inhibited COX-1dependent PGD 2 generation. Conclusion: Thus, exogenous NO regulates PGD 2 production by MC through regulation both of COX-1 and COX-2. Furthermore, these findings help us to understand the role of NO in MC function and the regulatory mechanisms of lipid mediator generation in MC in inflammatory diseases.",

UIPS, Immunopharmacology, Utrecht, Netherlands. Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major incurable global health burden and will become the third largest cause of death in the world by 2020. It is currently believed that an exaggerated inflammatory response to inhaled irritants, in particular cigarette smoke (CS), causes progressive airflow limitation. This inflammation, where macrophages and neutrophils are prominent, leads to oxidative stress, emphysema, small airways fibrosis and mucus hypersecretion. Mast cells are important effector cells in anaphylactic reactions and are involved in a variety of immunological and non-immunlogic processes. However, the role of mast cells in pathogenesis of emphysema not yet documented. Recently, we have demonstrated that CSM induces protease expression and chemokine release by primary mast cells. In this study, we further investigated the effects of CSM on the cytokine production of mast cells respect to activation with IgE and antigen. Materials and Methods: BMMC were cultured from BALB/cBy mice for 3 weeks. Cells were exposed against CSM and activated with IgE and antigen.",

(Saururaceae; HC) is known as a therapeutic drug that has been used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of allergic diseases. Mast cells function as regulatory cells in a variety of inflammatory diseases, in particular, asthma and atopic dermatitis. In this study, we examined the effect of HC extracts on the chemotactic activity of the human mast cell line, HMC-1, induced by stem cell factor (SCF). The survival rate of HMC-1 cells was not altered by treatments with the HC extracts at a concentration of 10 2g/ml for 24 h. SCF showed the typical bell-shape curve for the HMC-1 cell chemoattraction with the peak of the curve at the SCF concentration of 100 ng/ml. HC-1, which was the whole plant (Houttuynia cordata) extracted with 80% EtOH, and HC-3, which was the residue successively partitioned with EtOAc, both had inhibitory effects on HMC-1 cell movement. After the treatment with 10 6g/ ml HC-1 extract for 6 h and 24 h, the chemotactic index (CI) of HMC-1 cells decreased up to 73% and 63%, respectively. HC-3 extract significantly inhibited the cell movement (72% T 6% and 44% T 2%). The HC-1 and HC-3 extracts had no inhibitory effect on the mRNA and protein expressions of c-kit, SCF receptor. SCF tranduces the chemotaxis signaling via NF-kB translocation, and both extracts blocked the activation. Taken together, our results indicate that HC-1 and HC-3 extracts inhibit the chemotactic activity of HMC-1 cells in response to SCF by blocking the NF-kB activation. These substances may be helpful for treating the inflammatory diseases associated with mast cells.",

The investigation of mast cell activation enhances the understanding of allergies and requires easy supply of large number of mast cells of culture. Bone marrow derived mast cell (BMMC) are the mast cells to provide sufficient number of cells and are affected by the kinds of cytokine combination and dose both in proliferation and in differentiation. This investigation was about the effect of culture condition on rat BMMC cultivation in serum supplement and cytokines. Methods: Rat bone marrow cells were cultured with the media conditioned differently by the addition of individual, or mixed cytokines of IL-3 IL-4 IL-6 and SCF. Rat BMMC proliferation was measured using CCk-8 assay. Rat BMMC differentiation was analyzed by the level of RMCPl T. Serum supplement effect on rat BMMC culture was investigated by comparison of the media including horse sera with the media carrying rat sera. Results: In the culture with horse serum supplement, rat BMMC proliferation in the presence of IL-3 (10 ng/ml) mixed with SCF (10 ng/ml) was the highest among the applied cytokine mixture. Rat BMMC with the mixture of cytokine concentration showed relatively high level of RMCPl T. In the culture with rat serum supplement, the cytokines condition of IL-3 10ng/ml with SCF 10ng/ml did not induce RMCPl T production. However the adjustment of cytokine concentration with the mixture of IL-3 10ngml and SCF 1.25ng/ml enhanced RMCPl T synthesis, comparable to the level produced by IL-3 10ng/ml and SCF 10ng/ml in the media supplemented with horse serum. Conclusion: These results indicated that rat BMMC preparation requires IL-3 and SCF, and that rat BMMC differentiation be affected by the ratio between IL-3 and SCF and by the kind of serum.",

Background: Stress may facilitate intestinal inflammation by promoting epithelial barrier dysfunction allowing luminal antigens to enter the mucosa that may be crucial for the development of food allergy. Methods: Male WKY rats were submitted to crowding stress (CS) (8 rats/ cage) or sham-crowding (2 rats/cage) for 15 days. In addition, ketotifen, a known mast cell stabilizer or saline was injected i.p. at day 14th (1 mg/kg, 2 doses, 12 h interval). At the end of the stress or sham protocols, jejunal segments were mounted in Ussing chambers to measure macromolecular permeability to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Rat mast cell protease II (RMCPII), an indicator of mast cell activation, was measured in jejunal perfusates and in jejunal homogenates at the end of stress or sham exposure. Plasma corticosterone and CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) receptor 1 (R1) and 2 (R2) expression in jejunal tissue was measured by an ELISA assay by RT-PCR respectively. Results: Plasma corticosterone was tree fold increased after the stress protocol in the CS group (CS: 138T27 ng/mL vs. control: 52T16; p=0.0001; n=8/ group). CRH-R1 but not CRH-R2 expression was increased in the CS when compared to control. Crowding stress (CS) induced an increase in HRP permeability (CS: 18,2T5 pmol/cm2/h vs. control: 6,2T2.8; p=0.0004;), that was diminished when ketotifen was administered (12,1T5,2 pmol/cm2/h; p=0,015 vs CS; n=8/group ). Furthermore, jejunal RMCPII was higher in perfusates from stressed rats (CS: 23.6 T 5.1 6g/L vs. control: 14.8 T 9.9; p=0.021; n=8/group) and in tissue homogenates (CS: 456T123 ng/mg of tissue vs. control 274T84; p=0.002: n=8/group) suggesting ongoing mast cell activation. Ketotifen reduced the increased RMCPII in both jejunal perfusates (16,5T7,2 6g/L; p=0,019 vs. CS; n=8/group) and in tissue homogenates (198T72 ng/mg of tissue; p=0,002 vs. CS; n=8/group). Ketotifen did not induce any change in the parameters evaluated in the control groups. Conclusion: Stress evoked an epithelial barrier defect that may facilitate the uptake of luminal macromolecules and is mediated by mast cells. This synergistic effect may play an important role in food allergy.",

It was drawn fourfold blood sampling, as the following: the first blood sampling was made before operation, the second -during first 24 hours after operation; the third -during fifth 24 hours after operation and the fourth -during fourteenth day after operation. Estimation of MMP-9/TIMP-1 was made by immunoenzyme method using of the test-system of BR & D System Inc.[, USA. Results: It was detected the following: before operation patients from group with smooth postoperative course had level of MMP-9/TIMP-1 equal 10.90T0.83 ng/ml that was essentially higher than patients of control group had, being 0.22T0.07 ng/ml (pG0.05) typical for healthy people. There was increase of MMP-9/ TIMP-1 (12.59T1.02 ng/ml, pG0.001) on the first days after operation with subsequent continued increase up to 12.75T1.25 ng/ml, pG0.001 on the 5th day. Essentially decrease of MMP-9/ TIMP-1 up to level of 12.40T0.98 ng/ml was observed on the first day after operation that for certain did no differ from values of first day after operation. In the patient group with complicated postoperative course the index MMP-9/ TIMP-1 before operation was 9.54T1.37 ng/ml, this index was higher in the control group as well (0.22T0.07 ng/ml (pG0.01). On the first day after operation it was observed rapid growth of MMP-9/ TIMP-1 (13.37T1.41 ng/ml, pG0.05) in above-mentioned patient group, and on the 5th day the level still persisted high (14.82T1.74 ng/ml).

Methods: IL-1beta was added to human articular cartilage with or without changes of osteoarthritis (OA) in explant culture to stimulate MMP production. Articular cartilage was incubated or preincubated with Hyalgan to assess the effect of Hyalgan on IL-1beta-induced MMPs. Secreted levels of MMPs-1, -3, and -13 in conditioned media were detected by immunoblotting, while intracellular MMP synthesis in chondrocytes was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopic analysis. Penetration of Hyalgan into cartilage tissue and its binding to CD44 were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using fluoresceninated Hyalgan. Blocking experiments with anti-CD44 antibody were performed to investigate the mechanism of HA action. Results: Treatment and pretreatment with Hyalgan resulted in significant suppression of IL-1beta-stimulated production of MMPs in normal and OA cartilage explant culture. Fluorescence histocytochemistry revealed that Hyalgan penetrated cartilage tissue and localized in the pericellular matrix around chondrocytes. Hyalgan -binding blocking experiments using anti-CD44 antibody demonstrated that association of HA with chondrocytes was mediated by CD44. Preincubation with anti-CD44 antibody, which suppressed IL-1beta-stimulated MMPs, reversed the inhibitory effect of Hyalgan on MMP production induced by IL-1beta in normal and OA cartilage. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that Hyalgan effectively inhibited IL-1beta-stimulated production of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13, which supports the clinical use of HA in the treatment of OA. Such Hyalgan action on IL-1beta may involve direct interaction between Hyalgan and CD44 on chondrocytes.

Theoretically, this result supports the hypothesis that RSV infection may cause reactive airway disease. Mechanisms of eosinophil infiltration in the middle ear of patients with eosinophilic otitis media Yukiko Yokoyama 1 , Ruby Pawankar 2 , Chika Ozu 2 , Tetsuo Ikezono 2 , Manabu Nonaka 2 , and Toshiaki Yagi 2 . 1 Nippon Medical School Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, Otorhinolaryngology, Chiba, Japan; 2 Nippon Medical School, Otorhinolaryngology, Tokyo, Japan. Background: Patients with intractable otitis media (OM) with co-existent bronchial asthma have an extensive accumulation of eosinophils in the effusion and mucosa of the middle ear; called eosinophilic otitis media (EOM). Previously, we reported that mast cells can regulate eosinophilic inflammation in nasal polyps. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of eosinophil accumulation in the middle ear, we analyzed eosinopil chemoattractants like RANTES, eotaxin and their ligand CCR3 as well as mast cell mediator tryptase in middle ear biopsies and effusion (MEE) of patients with OM with and without asthma. Materials and Methods: By ELISA, we analyzed the levels of RANTES and eotaxin in MEE and mucosa of patients with OM with and without asthma (control). The number of tryptase+ cells (mast cells), MBP+ cells (eosinophils), RANTES+, eotaxin+ and CCR3+ cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in middle ear biopsies. Results: Levels of RANTES and eotaxin were higher in patients with OM with asthma as compared to controls. Whereas in the mucosa of controls, MBP and eotaxin+ cells were not detected, they were markedly increased in patients with asthma in concert with high numbers of tryptase+, RANTES+ and CCR3+ cells. Background: Eosinophils preferentially accumulate at sites of airway inflammation of asthma. For circulating eosinophils to participate in the asthmatic airways, it is necessary to interact with adhesion molecules expressed on endothelial cells and then expose to inflammatory mediators such as cysteinyl leukotrienes(cysLTs). There is evidence that cysLTs including leukotriene (LT)D 4 regulate the functional status of eosinophils. Objective: To investigate whether interaction with adhesion molecules modifie eosinophil functions induced by cysLTs. Methods: rh-VCAM-1, rh-ICAM-1, or rh-P-selectin was dissolved in 0.05 M NaHCO 3 coating buffer, added to 96-well EIA plates and incubated at 4 -C overnight. Residual fluid was decanted and HBSS/0.1% gelatin was added to reduce non-specific activation of eosinophils. Eosinophils were isolated from blood of healthy donors, incubated in the EIA plates, and then exposed to LTD 4 . The generation of superoxide anion (O 2 j ) and release of eosinophil-derived neutrotoxin (EDN) were evaluated by cytochrome C reduction assay and ELISA, respectively. Finally, a combination of LTD 4 and VCAM-1, but not ICAM-1 or P-selectin, induced the release of EDN. Conclusion: The combination of VCAM-Ior ICAM-I and cysLT effectively induce effector functions of eosinophils. Eosinophil adhesion to and migrate across endothelial cells via these speficic adhesion proteins and subsequent exposure to cysLT may be involved in the manifestations of eosinophil activation in the airways of asthma.",

Using realtime PCR no IL-21 mRNA could be detected; however IL-21 receptor mRNA was detected with a mean Ct-value of 31.16 from 6 donors. No difference was seen between allergic and healthy individuals. The naBve Bcell line Ramos was used as a positive control and yielded a Ct-value of \u00c820, which is roughly a 1000-fold higher expression of IL-21R mRNA in Ramos compared to eosinophils. The IL-21R mRNA expression in eosinophils was comparable to the eosinophilic cell line HL-60 clone 15. A sandwich ELISA for detection of IL-21R in eosinophil cell lysate was established using a polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-21R antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-IL-21R. The ELISA had a detection limit of 1 ng/ ml or roughly 1000 receptors per cell and no IL-21R expression was detected in either eosinophils or Ramos cell line. The effect on eosinophil apoptosis in presence of IL-21 or the other Type I cytokines (IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, IL-28 and IL-29) was examined, however, no apparent effect of either increased survival or increased apoptosis could be seen. Conclusion: Eosinophils express IL-21R mRNA. Real-time PCR showed a mean Ct-value 31.16 from 6 donors. IL-21R protein expression was examined using both flowcytometry and ELISA, but no IL-21R could be detected. Functional apoptosis assay showed that IL-21 or the other Type I cytokines had no effect on eosinophils, so it is unlikely that IL-21 stimulation of eosinphils is of major significance. Background: IL-5 is critically involved in proliferation, activation, migration and survival of eosinophils. As such, IL-5 may play a pathogenic role in hypereosinophilic syndromes (IHES), which are a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by sustained peripheral blood and/or tissue eosinphilia. We assessed the safety and efficacy of a humanized monoclonal anti-IL5 antibody in a patient with IHES with respiratory involvement. Methods and Results: The patient is a 25 year-old woman, with a 3 year history of IHES. Biopsies confirmed on various occasions the involvement of lungs and paranasal sinuses. The onset of the disease was an eosinophilic pneumonia (56% eosinpohils in bronchial lavage) with asthma and respiratory failure. The persistent eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms were successfully treated with doses of prednisone (25Y75 mg/daily), variable according to eosinophilia.

Vladivostok State Medical University, Pathophysiology, Vladivostok, Russian Federation. Significant components of the territorial matrix are the matrix metalloproteinase that is a group of proteolytic enzymes, which are especially active in conditions of an inflammatory response. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9) is produced by normal alveolar macrophages, granulocytes, and neutrophiles. Expression of MMP 9 is increased in tissues affected by the process of remodeling and angiogenesis. Negative influence of this process is restricted by tissular inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1). Main function of TIMP-1 consists in regulation of distraction of collagen and basic membrane components. We have researched a quotient of MMP 9 and its first type's inhibitor contained in the bronchalveolar lavage fluid of 23 teenagers suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. Received results have been processed through statistical analysis; an arithmetic mean (M) and a mean error (m) have been also determined. Fidelity of results has been reckoned through Mann -Whitney nonparametric test. Evaluation was made in accordance with the clinical and laboratory findings and bacteriological test of sputum. The researches have shown that quantity of hMMP-9/TIMP-1 in the bronchalveolar lavage fluid of pulmonary tuberculosis patients comes to 2803, 85 T 270, 72 pg/ml.

The purpose of the present investigation was to reveal influence of the etiologic factor on parameters of the local and systematic structure of the opposite cytokines (IFN, and IL-10) at the experimental pneumonia caused by S. aureus and E. coli. Infection of mice of \u00d1 \u00c2 \u00c0 line was spent intranasally in the doze of 1x103 mt/ml for S. aureus (I experimental group) and 1x105 mt/ml for E. coli (II experimental group). Production of cytokines by blood cells and mice lungs was investigated for the 10th day after infection in reaction of IFA. Results and Conclusion: At infection of mice S. aureus level of IFN, considerably (8 G0,05) decreased (up to 0,84+0,1 pg/ml in blood and up to 36,38+2,38 pg/ml in supernatant of lungs). IL-10 level at mice of tentative group also tended to decrease and made 14,15+1,3 pg/ml in blood and 70,8+2,88 pg/ml in supernatant of pulmonary tissue. At infection of mice E. coli content of IFN, in blood changed little (3,97+0,28 pg/ml), and decreased in supernatant of lungs, but not so prominently, as at mice of tentative group (70,84+2,17 pg/ml). IL-10 level in blood of mice of the second experimental group was authentic (8 G0,05) below than in group of the control and made 10,8+0,87 pg/ml.

We firstly found that CB-derived g/d cells strongly respond to stimulation with aminobiphosphonate (ABs) compounds, such as pamidronate and zoledronate, in terms of expansion, whereas stimulation with pyrophosphates (PPs) only lead to no or little expansion. The population expanded with ABs is also perfectly functional, since cells are able to produce large amounts of cytokines (TNFalfa e IFNgamma) if secondarily stimulated with he same antigens.

Kharkov National University, Fundamental Medicine, Kharkov, Ukraine. Background: Th1 and Th2 cells, resulting from antigenic stimulation in the presence of IL-12 and IL-4, respectively, are implicated in the pathology of various diseases including allergic and autoimmune diseases. In this study we have asked whether administration of beta-carotene brings about a Th1/Th2 shift in vivo of the mice, and subsequent reduction of circulating IgE. Methods: Feed containing beta-carotene was administered orally to BALB/c mice immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA) for approximately 1 month. The titers of OVA-specific IgE, OVA-specific IgG1 and OVA-specific IgG2a in the mouse sera were determined. Cytokine productions by the spleen cells and serum Ig concentrations were studied by ELISA. We also examined the effect of fed beta-carotene on active systemic anaphylaxis. Results: Feeding beta-carotene to mice immunized with OVA inhibited the immediate reduction of the body temperature induced by antigen stimulation. Furthermore, the increase in serum histamine in the mice fed beta-carotene under active systemic anaphylaxis was lower than in controls. We then examined the pattern of cytokine production by spleen cells from mice followed by restimulation with OVA in vitro. The spleen cells showed enhanced Th1-specific cytokine production; spleen cells from the betacarotene administered mice produced more IFN-gamma as compared with those from control mice in an antigen-specific manner. IL-2 and IL-4 secretions of the spleen cells were comparable between the two mouse groups. Beta-carotene administration did not reduce serum IgG concentration. It markedly reduced total IgE level and an IgG1/IgG2a ratio, reflection of Th1/Th2 balance, in sera. Furthermore, beta-carotene administration reduced ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgE levels in sera of the OVA sensitized mice. Conclusion: Thus, beta-carotene enhances IFN-gamma secretion and thus modulates Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, leading to reduction of serum IgE.",

Cukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Pediatric Allergy-Immunology, Adana, Turkey. Objective: Latex allergy is becoming a major health concern among healthcare workers, of whom approximately 2.8 to 18% are reportedly sensitized. The aim of this study to determine the prevalence of latex allergy and potential crossreacting foods in operating room stuffs. Methods: One hundred and four operating room stuffs (aged 24 years to 58 years) including doctors, nurses and technicians completed a latex allergy questionnaire. They were questioned about symptoms of latex reactivity and about other allergies particularly to foods that may crossreact with latex. Informed consent was obtained and skin prick tests were performed with natural rubber latex.and with five potentially crossreacting foods (banana, kiwi, melon, tomato and potato). Specific IgE antibodies against latex and these foods were evaluated (Pharmacia CAP RAST system). Results: Five personnel (4.8%) described allergic symptoms they attributed to latex exposure. All latex allergic stuffs had skin symptoms, 2 had severe anaphylactic reaction and 2 had severe asthma. All these 5 personnel had positive reactions to both latex and crossreactive foods. Specific IgE against to latex was found to be positive in this group. There was no significant difference between the latex SPT-positive and -negative health care workers according to age, sex and total exposure time to latex. Conclusion: In this study we found the prevalence of allergy 4.8% among the operating room personnel. Although latex allergy was not more frequent in our population its presence may lead to severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis and severe asthma. Background: The effect of dog ownership during childhood on the development of allergy has been investigated in few studies with conflicting results. Objective: We investigate the association between childhood dog ownership, regular contact to dogs, and indoor endotoxin exposure during infancy and the development of allergic sensitization and atopic disease up to age 6 in 2 German cohort studies. Methods: Data from two ongoing birth cohorts GINI (n=1962) and LISA (n=1193) were analysed. In both studies, information on children_s contact with dogs and their allergic symptoms and doctor diagnosed allergic disease were collected at each follow-up using questionnaire. Specific IgE antibodies to common aeroallergens were measured at age 6. House dust samples were collected when the children were 3 months old and the amount of endotoxin in house dust was determined. Results: Dog ownership in early childhood was associated with a significant lower rate of mixed pollen and inhalant sensitization but had no effect on dog sensitization and the prevalence of allergic symptoms and diseases up to age 6. Regular contact with dog during childhood without ownership was not associated with any of the health outcomes. No associations were found between house dust endotoxin exposure during infancy and sensitization to dog, mixed pollen, and inhalant allergens. Conclusion: Dog ownership in early childhood protects against the development of inhalant sensitization and this effect cannot be attributed to the simultaneous exposure to endotoxin.",

Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. Background: The school environment is an important source of exposure to furry-pet allergens for most children in Sweden. This will have an impact on their health and possibly on development of allergy. The aim of this study was to compare two methods of allergen sampling, and to investigate the association between percentage of animal owners and allergen levels. Methods: Totally 120 classes in 35 primary and secondary schools in Uppsala, Sweden, were randomly selected. A questionnaire, including questions on pet ownership, was answered by 2 355 pupils aged 7Y13 years. Samples of settled dust were collected from floors and furniture throughout the classroom with a vacuum cleaner with a special sampling filter (ALK Abello). Airborne particulates were collected passively in Petri-dishes placed in the class-rooms over a week. Allergen levels for cat, dog and horse were determined using ELISA. Correlations between allergen levels in settled dust and air, and number of cat-and dog owners as well as those who ride in each class were analysed by Spearman_s rank correlation, with a two-tailed significance level of 5%. Results: The geometric mean (GM) allergen level in settled dust was 1530 ng/g for Fel d 1, 1420 ng/g for Can f 1, and 1340 U/g for Equ cx. In Petri dish samples, the GM allergen level was 1.8 ng/sample for cat, 1.3 ng/sample for dog and 4.7 U/sample for horse. The percentage (GM) of cat-owners was 27%, dog-owners 14% and horse contact 8%. Cat allergen level in dust correlated with cat in air (0.33, p=0.000) and percentage of cat-owners (0.30, p=0.001). Dog allergen level in dust correlated with dog allergen in air (0.27, p=0.003), and percentage of dog-owners (0.40, p=0.000). The same was valid for horse allergen level in dust, which correlated with horse allergen in air (0.37, p=0.000) and percentage of those who ride (0.44, p=0.000). Conclusion: In all cases, we found a correlation between percentage of animal-owners or riders and allergen levels in dust and air samples. A correlation between dust and air allergen levels has seldom been shown before. We believe that sampling over the whole floor, benches and chairs gives a more representative value. However, dust levels are proxy variables, and air levels may be a better measure of allergen exposure.",

Exposure to house dust mites (HDM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) were also known risk factors for severe asthma in this population. However, such data is unclear in Asians. This study investigates indoor exposure to endotoxin, HDM and NO 2 in Hong Kong asthmatic children, and its relation to their disease severity. Methods: Asthmatics aged 6 to 18 years old were eligible, and spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were measured in the clinic. Home visits were done within 10 days. Dust was collected from patients' mattress, and carers completed ISAAC written questionnaire. House dust Der p 1 and endotoxin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent and chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assays, respectively. Average NO 2 levels in kitchens were measured over 48-hour periods by Ogawa sampler badge. Results: 115 asthmatic patients, aged 12.4 T 3.2 years, were recruited. Their median FEV 1 and eNO were 92% predicted and 50.5 ppb. Fifty-eight percent of these patients wheezed in past 12 months, and 44% of asthmatics received inhaled steroid. During home visits, 39.2 (24.6/65.9) mg mattress dust was collected. The median (IQR) mattress Der p 1 and endotoxin levels were 0.61 (0.24/2.46) 2g/g and 12.4 (6.4/19.5) EU/mg, respectively. A trend was observed for the correlation between mattress Der p 1 and endotoxin load (> = <0.176, P = 0.060), but neither factor was associated with indoor NO 2 (P 9 0.15). Der p 1 levels = 2 2g/g was found in 29% of families. Kitchen NO 2 levels were 27.1 T 10.4 ppb, and which exceeded 21 ppb in 78% of families. Indoor Der p 1 levels were significantly associated with night awakening (P = 0.049) and eNO (P = 0.010), whereas mattress endotoxin load was higher in patients with low peak expiratory flow rate (P = 0.031). No association was found between indoor NO 2 and any clinical or spirometric parameter. Conclusion: Our results suggest that asthma severity in Chinese children is affected by current exposure to HDM allergen in mattress but not indoor endotoxin or NO 2 exposure.",

Methods: The study planned to interview 1384 of pupils of I-IV class from different schools, for selection of children with chronic respiratory diseases. The lot of study included 54 of children with chronic bronchopulmonary diseases. The clinic examination of these children emphasized 18 cases with bronchial asthma, 9 cases with obstructive chronic bronchitis and in 27 cases simple chronic bronchitis. The hygienic condition of occupation conditions in study rooms of pupils was carried out by means of Air Quality Monitor (AQ-5000, USA), that determines the values of microclimate factors (temperature, air humidity, CO2 concentration). Results: Hygienic evaluation of occupation conditions in study rooms detected a subnormal thermal regime 15,54 T 0,1-C, at the beginning of first lesson 16,8 T 0,2-C and at the end of last lesson (optimal t +20 +25-C).

Tartu University Hospital, Childre\u0144s Clinic, Tartu, Estonia. Background: Sensitization against house dust mite (HDM) allergens is common in Estonia and the level of D. pteronyssinus (Der p1) and D. farinae (Der f1) is high in the houses. Diminishing contact with HDM reduces allergy symptoms and therefore it is important to decrease the level of HDM allergens. Milbiol (Hexal AG, Holzkirchen, Germany ) is an oil extract produced from neem tree (margosa) seeds. Milbiol is harmless for humans and animals, although it hinders growth and reproduction of mites. Aim: To estimate the efficiency of Milbiol in decreasing the level of HDM allergens. Methods: Study period was Dec 2003 -Dec 2004. Study group comprised 44 beds from 19 homes. Twenty-five beds were vacuum cleaned and treated with Milbiol (intervention group) and 19 beds were only vacuum cleaned (control group). Frequency of cleaning was identical and it was performed at the same time for beds of both groups. The dust samples were collected on the 1st, 3rd and 12th month and treatment with Milbiol was performed on the 1st and 2nd month according to the manufactory instructions. The levels of Der p1 and Der f1 in the dust samples were measured by ELISA method. Data about the living conditions were also collected. Results: In all beds the level of Der f1 (8614 T 2654 ng/g) was higher than the level of Der p1 (520 T 260 ng/g, p G 0.001). HDM allergens were more common in old brick houses, on lower floors, in rooms with carpets and in beds older than 5 years. Before and after treatment with Milbiol the mean level of Der f1 was 4180 T 1502 ng/g and 2784 T 868 ng/g, respectively; p 9 0.05, however, after one year the level increased up to 6032 T 2092 ng/g. The level of Der p1 increased after treatment with Milbiol from 556 T 353 ng/g up to 784 T 408 ng/g; p = 0.005; although after 12 months the level was lower than before treatment (282 T 163 ng/g). The mean level of HDM allergen decreased also in the control group beds due to vacuum cleaning -Der p1 from 471 T 394 to 177 T 121 ng/g and Der f1 from 14447 T 5628 to 8733 T 3700 ng/g, p G 0.05; respectively. Conclusion: Milbiol alone was not effective for decreasing HDM allergens in beds during one-year period after treatment; however, more frequent treatment with Milbiol could give better results. Lower level of HDM allergens was gained also by regular vacuum cleaning.",

Long-term industrial pollutants exposure may lead to imbalance in the oxidant-antioxidant or proteasesantiproteases systems in the pulmonary tissue witch is followed by unimpeded neutrophil elastase digestion of elastin and collagen in the alveolar walls and progressive emphysema. Methods: We were interested in comparing the level Alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) between patients with occupational pulmonary pathology, healthy men, working under industrial pollutants exposure more than 15 years and healthy donors. The subjects in the study were 84 men between the ages of 45 and 60. The main group of study included patients with chronic occupational bronchitis (n = 25), electric welder pneumoconiosis (n = 10), silicoses (n = 29); the first (1) control group included 10 patients without occupational lung disorders and the second (2) control group -10 healthy donors. We measured the level of AAT by immunoturbidimetric assay for quantitative in vitro determination of AAT in human serum on automated clinical analyzes. We used reagents produced by BRoche-Diagnostics[. Normal level 0,9/2,0 g/l. Results: We found that the level of AAT was under normal among patients with electric welder pneumoconiosis (0,78 T 0,23). It was significantly lower (p G 0,05) than the level in both control groups (group 1/1,23 T 0,16; group 2 Y 1,26 T 0,16). We did not find significant differences of serum concentration of AAT between silicoses (1,09T0,37), chronic occupational bronchitis (1,15 T 0,27) and control groups. It was even normal. It was a tendency of AAT concentration increasing due to the term of pollutants exposure. Conclusion: Long-term industrial pollutants exposure may lead to chronic airway inflammation and caused the imbalance in proteases-antiproteases systems. There was an activation of alpha-1-antitrypsin secretion as the most important proteinase inhibitor among men working under industrial pollutants exposure. The level of alpha-1-antitrypsin was normal among patients with chronic bronchitis, silicoses and healthy workers. We found that AAT level could be decreased among patients with electric welder pneumoconiosis. We supposed that it could be the result of oxidative inhibition of the welding aerosol components on AAT secretion.",

Background: Several studies describe damage from passive smoking in humans and animal models. However, how different chemical and physical components relate to mechanisms of damage is not completely understood. Cigarette smoke is composed by a gas phase and a particulate phase, in which a lot of toxicologically relevant compounds are present. We focused our investigations on the particulate phase of environmental cigarette smoke, as the amount and dimensions of suspended particles have been only partially studied so far. It is noteworthy that the size of particles is very important in the inhalation process and in their subsequent deposition into the respiratory tract. Methods: Differences in granulometry of suspended dust and bacterial load were studied in a 120-cubic meter no-smoking room during and after one cigarette smoke in ten different experiments. To evaluate granulometry in suspended dust we used a 6 channel particle counter, which analyzes particles according to their granulometry. We evaluated suspended bacterial load by using a multipierced sampler on a fixed replaceable plate set to aspirate air. Evaluation of sedimented bacterial load was performed by using the Air Microbial Index technique which expresses the total number of microrganisms settled by gravity onto a Petri plate. Results: An increase of medium and small, but not large suspended particles number was observed. Bacterial and mycotic load decreased during and up to 60 min after cigarette smoking. Gram-positive cocci never decreased while chromogen-bacteria and mycetes decreases at 30 min. Furthermore, we observed an increase of sedimented bacteria and mycetes at 60 min, a decrease at 120 min and a stabilization at 180 min. Conclusion: We hypothesize that tobacco burning accelerates sedimentation of larger agglomerates of mean-size smoke particles and bacteria which may be resuspended by movements of people in the room and consequently be inhaled. They could have a stronger affinity with airways surfaces, modifying the normal mechanisms of non-specific and immunologic defenses against microbes, above all in children. This could partially explain the increasing of respiratory infections in children exposed to second-hand smoke.",

Pastorello 2 , and Sandra Citterio 1 . 1 University of Milano Bicocca, Dept. of Environmental Science, Milan, Italy; 2 Niguarda C\u00e0 Granda Hospital, Unit of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Milan, Italy. Background: Air pollutants seems to play a fundamental role in promoting allergies and in worsening the health conditions of allergic people. New interesting findings suggest that traffic-related pollutants do not only irritate the airways, but can also make allergens more aggressive, especially pollen allergens. In particular, air pollutants can induce and/or increase the expression of some allergenic proteins. They can also induce post-translational modifications (PTMs). These changes can make proteins more reactive towards the IgE. Our objective has been to investigate the effect of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) on pollen from birch (Betula pendula Roth) and ragweed (Ambrosia artemisifolia L.), two very common and important sources of allergens in Europe. Methods: Pollen samples were artificially exposed to different concentrations of NO 2 . Sera of birch and/or ragweed allergic patients were also collected. Pollen proteins were extracted from control (C) and treated (T) samples, separated by 2D electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and incubated: (a) with patient's sera to identify pollen allergens; (b) with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody to estimate the entity of protein nitration; (c) with a staining solution specific for glycosylated proteins. Finally, a treatment with lambda protein phosphatase (\u00ebPPase) were performed to identify changes in phosphorylation pattern. Results: NO 2 treatments did not induce new allergen expression, neither in birch, nor in ragweed pollen. Regarding PTMs, the treatments induced modifications in both birch and ragweed phosphorylation patterns. On the contrary, no changes in glycosylation profiles were detected in the analysed plants. Finally, few nitrated proteins were induced in birch treated samples. Conclusion: Exposure of pollen to NO 2 induced PTMs in allergens. However, future experiments are needed to confirm these first results.",

Background: Since outdoor and indoor air pollutants are environmental risk factors that have been shown to contribute to the development of respiratory infections and allergy, it is speculated that there is a positive relationship between allergic inflammation and inhalation of volatile organic compounds. Effect of low-level toluene inhalation on Th1/Th2 balance in allergic response remains unknown. Methods: To study the effect of exposure to low-level toluene on transcription factors for T-cell differentiation, male C3H/HeN and BALB/c mice were exposed to filtered air (control), 5, 50 and 500ppm toluene by whole body inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 3 and 6 weeks. The allergic model group of mice was injected intraperitoneally with 10 2g ovalbumin (OVA) plus 2 mg alum, and each of these mice was then challenged with nebulized OVA as a booster once every 2 weeks (weeks 2, and 4) during the exposure period. Then, by using a quantitative real-time PCR method, we investigated the expression of GATA3, T-bet and FoxP3 genes in spleen. Results: Exposure to 500ppm toluene for 3 weeks significantly increased the expression of GATA3 and FoxP3 mRNAs in spleen of C3H mice. In C3H mice exposed toluene for 6 weeks, the expression of GATA3, T-bet and FoxP3 mRNAs was increased at 50ppm toluene as compared to that of filtered air control. However, we did not observe any such pattern for the expression of T-bet and FoxP3 mRNAs in spleen of BALB/c mice. The expression of GATA3 mRNA was significantly suppressed by exposure to 500ppm toluene in BALB/c mice. Conclusion: This is the first study to show in vivo modulation of the expression of transcription factor genes in the different strains of mice by exposure to low-level toluene, in concert with antigenic stimulation. Background: Patients with asthma is prone to experience recurrent exacerbation of symptoms especially when they are exposed to environmental triggers. But it is not well defined what kind of clinical characteristics is associated with this predisposition. Methods: The Cohort for Reality and Evolution of Adult Asthma in Korea (COREA) study is a prospective, observational multi-center study and will be conducted for nine years (2005/2013) in Korea. Cross sectional data of baseline clinical characteristics were compared between asthmatics susceptible to asthma exacerbation by environmental triggers and asthmatics tolerable to those triggers based on self reported questionnaire at the time of enrollment. Results: Common cold (22.9%) was most frequent trigger followed by polluted or dusty air (16.6%), second hand smoke (11.5%), emotional stress (9.5%), animal (3.8%), and drug (1.0%) in descending order. The environmental triggers-sensitive asthmatics (TSA) showed female dominance (60.2% vs. 50.5%, P = 0.027) and higher prevalence of rhinosinusitis (63.2% vs. 53.6%, P = 0.041) than environmental triggers-tolerable asthmatics (TTA), while there was no significant difference in obesity, duration of symptom, atopic status, and lung function. More patients among TSA reported aggravation of asthmatic symptoms after moving to current house (16.1% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.001) and TSA had been living in the current house for significantly less time than TTA (P = 0.002). Conclusion: Female sex, having rhinosinusitis, moving into a new house was significantly associated with the susceptibility to asthma exacerbation by environmental triggers.",

Background: The main aim of this 3-years follow-up was to gain further insight into ocular nasal and skin symptoms, and to determine whether the incidence was related to personal, psychosocial, and occupational factors. Methods: To evaluate the differences of ocular nasal and skin symptoms, a self-administered questionnaire was mailed, in 1997 (n = 1857). Three years later, in 2000 (n = 1446), the questionnaire was sent again to airline crew on duty. The participation rate was 81% 1997 (n = 1513) and 79% 2000 (n = 1145). A cohort of 1134 subjects is used in this study. At the time of the questionnaire study 1997, smoking was allowed on intercontinental flights. Results: Atopy showed a significant reduction, and hay fever showed a significant increase. During both 1997 and 2000 ocular nasal and skin symptoms were more common in the cabin crew than in the pilots. The incidence of ocular nasal and skin symptoms was more common in cabin crew compared to pilots. The new-onset nasal and skin symptoms were more common in cabin crew compared to pilots. Younger age, work satisfaction, and stress due to excess of work were significantly more related to new-onset ocular nasal and skin symptoms. Cabin crew had significantly more new-onset of nasal symptoms compared to the pilots. Airline crew with hay fewer reported significantly more complaints on new-onset ocular and nasal symptoms. Airline crew with doctor's diagnosed asthma reported significantly more complaints on newonset nasal symptoms.

Presently Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is a major concern at various work places. Here is an important quote on air quality from a journal: BWith all the publicity, more and more people are realizing that pollutants in the indoor air could make them sick. The worst thing that has happened to the indoor air quality marketplace in the last year or so is also mold. This is because much of the media coverage is designed to sensationalize the topic and frighten the public -so much so, that the word Fmold' always seems to be preceded by the adjective Ftoxic._ Thus, homeowners and building managers are scared to death of any minor infestation that might possibly be toxic mold, and they often ignore other health issues, such as combustion byproducts, Volatile Organic Compounds, second-hand tobacco smoke and poor ventilation.[ This study was aimed at examining the efficiency the air purifier 3000 Xtreme in reducing the indoor spore and pollen counts of allergenic taxa present in different office facilities and residential buildings. Sets of the Petri plates and coated slides were placed with distances of 1foot, 2 feet, 4 feet, 6 feet and 12 feet away from the air purifier. Assay was done with the Petri plates prepared from Brain Heart Infusion agar (VWR) and Gelvatol coated slides with air purifier off for the control and on for the treated. The control Petri plates and slides were placed in the room without using the air purification system. The treated sets were assayed after 24 hour, 48 hour and 72 hour treatment. The slides were examined, analyzed, and photographed using a BX-40 Olympus microscope attached to a DP-70 Digital Camera. Petri plates were examined with an SZ-40 stereo-scope to observe and count the colonies. The control set of plates showed vigorous growth of the microbial colonies after incubation in an incubator at 37-C for 24 hours. Petri-plates closer to air purifier (2 ft. and 4 ft.) produced least number of colonies after 24 h., 48h. and 72 hours of treatment of the indoor air with the air purifier. There was very minor trace of inoculums from the Petri-plates from 2 ft. 4ft. and 8 ft. after 24 hours. After a 2-month continuous exposure of the room air with the Xtreme 3000 at BHigh[ setting we found complete eradication of aeroallergens.

Schools were randomly selected for the study, and all children falling within the study age group were included in the study. Children of age 13/14 years answered the questionnaires themselves, while they were answered by parents of the 6/7 year age group. Results: Total Number of Children Studied. Conclusion: The ISAAC study conducted in Islamabad has revealed that the prevalence of nasal problems and wheezing is more than double in the 13/14 year age group, as compared to the younger 6/7 year children. The very large number of 13/14 year olds reporting nasal problems is also very alarming, as there is a 3 fold more danger of these children developing asthma later in life.",

Background: ARIA guidelines are in the way of general criterion in classifying allergic rhinitis. Objective: The objective of study is research on Korean patients who are underwent allergic rhinitis according to their symptoms, severity, frequency and distribution patterns. Materials and Methods: Statistical analysis was done in 610 patients who had been diagnosed as allergic rhinitis at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and 540 patients at local clinics. All patients were categorized into 4 groups, mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate to severe intermittent and moderate to severe persistent groups according to their questionnaire research and allergy laboratory results. Results: The incidence of moderate to severe persistent group was 34.7 % and moderate to severe intermittent group was 17.1%. In the allergy laboratory results, there was a significant difference between groups in eosinophi count (P = 0.004). In questionnaire research, there were significant differences at each group concerning olfaction (P G 0.001), self-awareness of rhinitis (P = .013), previous history of rhinitis (P G 0.001), self-awareness of asthma (P = 0.001) and conjunctivitis (P G 0.001). There were significant differences in frequency of symptoms for allergic rhinitis and severity between groups (P G 0.001) and moderate to severe persistent group showed highest score. Conclusion: According to ARIA guidelines in categorizing patients, moderate to severe persistent group stands out as the biggest part. Consequently differentiated therapeutic approach between groups will be useful.",

The present study is a comparison of the sensitization profiles in children suffering from either asthma or eczema alone using a panel of mite allergens from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) and Blomia tropicalis(Blo t). Methods: A total of 60 children (age between 4 to 16 years old), 30 with asthma and 30 with eczema respectively were recruited in Singapore for the present study. The IgE levels specific to a panel of house dust mite-allergens from two mite species were measured using ELISA.

Background: Pertussis infection has been suspected to be a potential causal factor in the development of atopic disease because of the effect of pertussis immunization on specific IgE antibodies. Although several studies found a positive association between pertussis infection and atopic disorders, this relationship has not yet been studied in a population stratified by vaccination status. Objective of the present study was to assess the association between pertussis infection and atopic disorders in pertussis-unvaccinated children and in pertussis-vaccinated children. Methods: Using data from a previously conducted study on the relationship between the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-(inactivated) poliomyelitis vaccination in the first year of life and atopic disorders, the study population of 1872 8Y12 year old was divided into children pertussis-unvaccinated and children pertussis-vaccinated in the first year of life. Within each group the association between pertussis infection and atopic disorders (both as reported by the parents) was assessed. Results: In the unvaccinated group there were no significant associations between pertussis infection and atopic disorders. In the vaccinated group all associations between pertussis infection and atopic disorders were positive, the associations with asthma (odds ratio (OR) = 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI95%): 1.36Y3.70), hay fever (OR = 2.35, CI95%: 1.46Y3.77), and food allergy (OR = 2.68, CI95%: 1.48Y4.85) being significant. Conclusion: There was a positive association between pertussis infection and atopic disorders in the pertussis vaccinated group only. From the present study it can not be concluded whether this association is causal or due to reverse causation. Background: Allergic diseases are fairly common in all parts of the world and involve all ethnic groups with bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and eczema being the commonest manifestations. Despite our efforts, their incidence is on an escalating path. There appear to be no authentic data on the prevalence of allergic diseases in children in Pakistan, therefore the need was felt to carry out the prevalence studies in the country. Methods: To estimate the prevalence of allergic diseases in our country, this first ever study was carried out in the largest coastal city of Karachi which houses people from all ethnic groups and all socio-economic classes. As there were no statistics available for any age group in this regard, a Saudi Arabian Protocol using questionnaires for school children were used instead of ISAAC Protocol. Questionnaires were distributed to 1200 school children, age 6-15 years, in three different areas for proper proportional representation of high, middle, and low socioeconomic levels. A total of 700 (58.3%) questionnaires returned by the parents were found valid and thus included in the survey. The data was analyzed by using SPSS software. Results: The result shows that the prevalence of allergic diseases is quite high in Pakistan. The frequency of wheezing was found to be 15.2%, while the diagnosed cases of asthma were 9.5%. The frequency of allergic rhinitis was found to be 34.3%. The frequency of those having allergic rhinitis as well as wheezing episodes was 8%. There was no statistically significant difference between asthmatics and non-asthmatics by sex (P-value:0.402). Socioeconomic status was found to affect significantly (p value 0.001) as the prevalence of diagnosed asthma cases was 6.17% in high socioeconomic class, 13.11% in the middle-class and 2.4% in the low socioeconomic class. Family history of atopy was also found to be significantly higher in asthmatics. Conclusion: Allergic diseases are quite common in Pakistan but they remain under-diagnosed. The prevalence data of allergic rhinitis shows an alarming situation. These diseases were found to affect middle-class the most, while the lower and lower-middle class remains the least affected. In addition to diagnosis and management, prevention and education may help the country to fight back against the disease. Our study is in progress to increase the sample size and compare with the data from other cities being collected under the same protocol.",

Participants were recruited by multistage simple random sampling to represent students of Surabaya_s suburb areas. Methods: Only 499 out of 550 invited students were agreeing to be involved in this study in voluntary basis. They were 128 students of primary schools, 221 of secondary schools, and 150 of a university. Complete personal and family history of allergy, allergic symptoms or diseases, environmental or home exposure of various common allergens were obtained, physical examination and skin prick tests were done using a set of 36 different inhalant and ingested allergen extracts. Total serum IgE and specific IgE RAST for selected allergens were also measured. Results: There was a trend of increasing skin prick test (SPT) positivity among study subjects, being 21.90% among primary school children, to 29.05% among secondary school children, and to 45.30% among undergraduate students. Cockroach (42.85%) and mould (42.85%) were the most common allergens in primary school children, followed by house dust mites (28.57%), grass pollen (17.86%), and crab (14.29%). The order of most common allergens for secondary school children were: house dust mites (63.16%), cockroach (37.85%), mould (28.04%), grass pollen (23.38%), and crab (22.77%). The order for undergraduate students were: house dust mites (58.82%), cockroach (47.05%), crab (41.17%), mould (36.76%), and grass pollen (20.59%). There were some multiple SPT positivity among them, toward 2 or 3 allergens in general. Urticaria and rhinitis were the commonest clinical manifestation of allergy. History of atopy in the family was positive for only 36.7% of respondents. Conclusion: The prevalence of allergic sensitization among school children and undergraduate students in Surabaya suburb areas were increased, being above the previous estimates for Indonesia in 2003.

Background: Molecular mechanisms of peripheral sensitisation of nociceptors could be identical for painful and pruritic (allergic) diseases. Therefore therapeutic approaches for pain treatment may also be beneficial for allergy. Montelukast, cyproheptadine and ketorolac tromethamine are found to be effective in migraine and allergy. This study is to document the association between migraine and allergic disorders. Methods: Study spanning 5 years. 10240 migraine patients were questioned about various allergic manifestations. Results: 7995 (78%) were suffering from various allergic manifestations either at the time of consultation or sometime in the past. Nasal allergy was the commonest 6395 (80%), ocular allergy in 4797 (60%), bronchial allergyin 3198 (40%), and skin allergy in 640 (8%). 1439 were suffering from all 3 allergies(naso oculo bronchial). Conclusion: Allergic disorders increased the risk for migraine and migraine increased the risk for allergy. This bidirectional association immensely helps the clinician to explain the causative molecular mechanisms and the genetic origin of these two conditions in the most simple way to their patients. House dust are considered to be a source of potent allergen responsible for different allergic manifestations. A total of 54 species of mites belonging to 33 genera, 18 families under 3 orders have been recorded from house dust samples collected from asthmatic patients residing in and arround rural areas. All the allergenic mites viz. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, Austroglycyphagus sp., Blomia tropicalis., Acarus siro, Glycyphagus domesticus, G.destructor, Tyrophagus putriscentiae except Euroglyphus sp. have been recorded. Among them Dermatophagoides alone contituted more than 60% of the total mites isolated. Patients bed contained significantly higher mite population than the control subjects bed dust (pG0.02) and among two different habitats examined i.e. bed and corresponding bed room floor dust, the former contained higher ( p G 0.01) mite density than the later. Analysis of skin prick test against dust related allergens revealed that 82.4% of the patients showed marked preference towards Dermatophagoides mite allergens. Estimation of total serum IgE level indicates that patients sera contained significantly higher level than the control sera (p G 0.001). RAST result further confirms the higher degree of sensitivity towards house dust mites (84.76%). The clinical history of the patients, the physical appearance of allergenic mites in higher concentration in the patients bed, positive skin test results with mite extract and identification of mite specific IgE antibodies in patients' sera by RAST technique established the role of dust mites on the aetiopathogenesis of bronchial asthma in developing country. Background: There was a strongly controversy between the protective or inductor effects of parasites infections and the risk of development allergic diseases in several countries. Moreover, It had been proposed that shared antigens between helminthes parasites and environmental allergens could modulated allergic immune responses. However, evidences for this process has not been consistently establish. Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the allergic reactivity and helminthes parasites coexistence in a group of unselected 61 scholar Children, reflecting a population with a profound socioeconomic depression, a high rate of common childhood infectious diseases such as diarrheas (8344 x 100.00 inhabitants), acute respiratory infections (1528 x 100.00 inhabitants) and high prevalence of helminthic infections (53%). Additionally by ELISA, we detected the levels of th1 (INF+), and th2 (IL-4) cytokines as well as the levels of total and specific IgE against Dermatophagoides pteronissynus, Blomia tropicalis and Ascaris Lumbricoides. We performed an inhibition specific IgE test between mites and Ascaris lunbricoides in order to establish the cross reactivity between these allergens. We also performed clinical evaluation, hematological studies and skin prick test with common food, mites and parasites allergens. Results: Sixty seven percent of children (group 1) showed respiratory symptoms or skin manifestations. Fifty % had high leukocyte count and had high INF+ levels (4190-5320 UI/ml) than control group. Skin prick tests were positive in 43% of children to at least one of the common allergens evaluated: 77% were positive to Ascaris lumbricoides, 27% to Blo t and 27 % to D.pt. Fifty % had high total IgE levels, (3812 -910000UI). Eighty one percent showed levels of specific IgE higher than 17.5 UI/ml to Ascaris and 67% to D.pt. Before the inhibition test the median levels of specific IgE to Ascaris diminished from 14.17UI/ml to 3,43UI/ml % and to D.pt from 12,94 to 3,37 UI/ml.",

Kazan Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Rospotrebnadzor, Kazan, Russian Federation. Backround: Since 1859 when has described first time G. lamblia as the activator of disease of a gastroenteric path, the huge material of epidemiology and pathogenesis of lambliasis and as effective enough ways of therapy of the given disease have been developing and collecting. But also at the moment, concerning this disease, there are the numerous questions expecting the decision. Most important of this group of problems, intensively discussed problem of diagnostics and prevalence G. lamblia among people is. Methods: We use commercial ELISE-test and the immunochromatography methods revealing specific antibodies in whey of blood and antigen_s in excrements. They possess more sensitivity (66,3 Y 98,9 %) and high specificity (92,6 %) unlike routine microscopic methods in diagnosis of lambliasis. In connection with before be the aforesaid, till now the most widely applied test in laboratory diagnostics of lambliasis, such as a microscopy of sedimentary components of excrements or researching contents at duodenal sounding for the purpose of revealing cysts of G. lamblia. In the literature as the method enrichment formalin-radio is recommended. Unfortunately, the specified tests of laboratory diagnosis of lambliasis possess low sensitivity, subject to influence of some subjective and objective factors among which, such as changeable allocation cysts of G. lamblia, difficulty for microscopic identification. Results: We used the combined method of research of excrements This method allowed to improve essentially delectability cysts G. lamblia in comparison with a routine method microscopy of fecal. We will especially notice, that at comparative research of tests in which activators lambliasis have been revealed and using three components a method and microscopy research of fecal in the first case the big degree invasion came to light. It has paramount value at definition of necessity of carrying out of therapy lambliasis. Conclusion: As using combined method using three components for flotation of research of excrements, we managed to increase essentially delectability G. lamblia and as to reduce quantity of repeated researches necessary for the exact diagnosis of lambliasis. Accuracy of definition of degree invasion an organism this elementary has besides, increased, that has allowed to correct therapy.",

Background: Microbiological colonization and subsequent biofilm formation on denture materials play an important role in the development of denture stomatitis often triggering allergic incompatibilty of denture materials as the penetrability of the mucosa is changed. Despite the high standards in reconstructive surgery and even with the use of free vascularized flaps postmaxillectomy rehabilitation with obturator prosthesis is still the mainstay reconstructive procedure in several cases. With current use polymer based silcone-or methacrylate-obturators bear the risk of an increasing settlement and penetration of bacteria and thus the risk of local or even systemic infections. Titanium-obturators [TO] for oral rehabilitation offer favorable characteristics concerning growth of microbial biofilms. The aim of our study was to compare the prevalence of microbial contamination on titanium-and polymer based -obturators [PO] used for post-maxillectomy rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: We investigated the obturators of 36 patients (17 TO, 19 PO), all had undergone maxillectomy due to malignancy in the period 1999-2204. Microbiological samples of the obturator surfaces, the adjacent mucous surfaces and of the interior of the PO (when new fabrication was planned) were collected with a sterile swab. Microbiological analysis was performed by conventional methods, including microscopy and culture on different agars. For statistical data analysis Fisher_s exact test [FT] (P-value P e .05) and odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval) were used. Results: PO showed a significantly higher quantitative contamination and a shift to non physiological bacteria compared to TO (p = 4.944e-06 [FT], 6.84 [OR] ). There is a high statistical risk (factor 1.4) for penetration of bacteria to the interior of PO when the pathological bacteria are seeded on the surface of PO (p = 0.01966). Conclusion: The use of titanium-obturators for the oral rehabilitaton of post-maxillectomy patients significantly reduces the risk of contamination with pathological oral bacteria and therefore prevents patients from local oral or systemic infections. Especially in cases of incompatibility of polymer based denture materials titanium-obturators offer an alternative therapeutic option.",

Prevalence of overall allergy is 15.6 %. Persistent rhinitis, asthma and dermatitis are 12.3 %, 3% and 2.3%, respectively. About urticaria, 9.5% reported history of acute (78%) and chronic type (22%). 4.4% revealed history of food allergy of which the most common culprit was sea-food allergy (73.9%). 2.7% showed history of insect sting allergy in which 46.2% of them had large local reaction and 3 of 13 had anaphylactic reaction. Drug allergy is 2.3% with history of allergy to betalactams (25%), NSAIDS (25%) and paracetamol (16.7%). Family history of atopy is significantly associated with history of rhinitis (P G 0.0001), asthma (P G 0.0001), urticaria (P = 0.001), conjunctivitis (P = 0.029) and food allergy (p G 0.0001). There is no association between history of allergy and sex, age or occupation. There is also a close association among chronic rhinitis, asthma and food allergy (P G 0.0001).

Background: Toluene, a widely used aromatic organic solvent, has been well characterized as a environmental toxic chemical. Volatile organic compounds including toluene are the possible substances causing chemical sensitivity in human. Our laboratory has previously showed that the exposure of low-level toluene causes immunological and neurological modulation in adult mice. Recently, it has been suggest that TLR2/4 ligand such as peptidoglycan (PGN) or LPS modulates Th2-driven allergic immune responses in animal studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of low-level toluene exposure and PGN stimulation on systemic Th1/Th2 immunity in infant mice. Methods: We exposed pregnant BALB/c mice to filtered air (0 ppm), 5 ppm, and 50 ppm toluene for 6 h/day on 5 days/week for 1 week (from day 14 of gestation until delivery) in the whole body exposure chamber. The offspring were further exposed to toluene of same schedule for 3 weeks (from the day of birth up to day 21). Some of the pregnant mice were repeatedly exposed to aerosolized PGN 2002g/10 ml (3 times per week) during the toluene exposure period. Offspring from the toluene and PGN exposed pregnant mice were further repeatedly administered PGN 1002g (5 times per 2 weeks) intraperitoneally from day 7 up to day 21 during the toluene exposure period. One day following the last toluene exposure, we collected blood, spleen, and lung from each mouse. Then, total IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies in plasma and the production of cytokines (IL-12, IFN-+, IL-4, IL-5) in spleen and lung were assayed by ELISA method. Also, the expression of cytokine and transcription factor T-bet mRNAs in spleen was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR method. Results: Exposure of mice to low-level (5 or 50 ppm) toluene resulted in (1) increased IgG1 and decreased IgG2a antibodies in the plasma; (2) decreased T-bet mRNA significantly in spleen; and (3) decreased IFN-+ and IL-12 mRNA in spleen but not statistically significant. Next, exposure of mice to low-level toluene by combination with PGN stimulation compared to toluene alone resulted in decreased IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in the plasma and IL-12 mRNA in spleen. Conclusion: These findings suggest that low-level toluene exposure from fetal stage to neonatal stage may enhance the systemic Th2 function in infant mice. However, the exposure to combination of low-level toluene with PGN stimulation shifted Th1/Th2 immunity to suppressive direction.",

Background: It is well documented that human milk contains several immunomodulatory components which are important during the newborn_s immune system development. In this context, breastfeeding could provide the best possible nutrition. Its role in the development of allergies remains although controversial, due to possible individual differences and variations in the composition of the breast milk. Furthermore, other stimuli could interact with immune system during perinatal-neonatal period, interfering with breast feeding and hence with the immune system development. For these reasons, we are interested to investigate the different components (environmental, diet, familiarity etc.) that could be involved in the allergic diseases apperarence. Aim: The aim of this prospective birth cohort study is to investigate the concentration of cytokines involved in allergic reactions, IgA antibody production, soluble (s) CD14 and fatty acids in cord blood, colostrum and mature milk, from allergic and non allergic mothers. Moreover, the aim is to investigate whether breastfeeding practice, correlated with immunological profile, is determinant for the increased risk of atopic disease development in children. 32 mothers (17 allergics, 15controls) and their full term newborns were included in the study, until now. We measured cytokines in colostrum samples (2 days after birth), and in transitional breast milk samples ( Results: Different cytokines levels in colostrum and milk samples, were evidenced between allergic and non allergic mothers. In particular, our preliminary data showed that colostrum from allergic mothers has a significant increased level of IL-4, IL-13, IL-5, TGF beta 1 e 2 compared to samples from non allergic mother, while no differences in cytokines level were revealed in the milk samples from the same two groups.

The prevalence of at least one positive prick tests was 37.12%. A large difference by age was found: 58.9% were sensitized in the age group of 20Y29 years, 42.8% in the age group of 40Y49 years and 28% in the age group of 50Y60 years (p G 0.001). Sensitization to multiple allergens was common in the age group of 20Y29 years with 42.1% of the sensitized responding to at least four allergens, while this portion was only 12.8% of the sensitized among those aged 50Y59 years. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), conjunctivitis and wheeze increased significantly with increasing number of positive skin responses. Having a family history of AR or conjunctivitis was a significant risk factor for allergic sensitization and for sensitization to any of the pollen grains. Further, urban living in childhood added an increased risk for pollen sensitization. Conclusion: The prevalence of allergic sensitization was high in the urban adult population of Calcutta. More than half of those aged 20Y29 years were sensitized and 42.1% was sensitized to at least four allergens. Sensitization to multiple aeroallergens was associated with a high prevalence of asthma, AR or conjunctivitis and wheeze. HLAG, a nonclassical MHC class Ib molecule, plays a significant role in immuno-tolerogenic processes. HLA-G expression through alternative splicing generates membrane-bound and soluble isoforms secreted by activated (by IL-10) peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes. Genetic diversity of HLA-G consists of sequence variations in promoter, exonic and 3_untranslated (3_UTR) regions, some of which have been shown to affect HLA-G mRNA stability. Polymorphisms in the HLAG promoter region had previously been associated with asthma. Of interest is also the fact that the gene encoding the effector IL-10 also exhibits genetic polymorphism in populations. Given the plausible effect one over the other, in this study, we investigated the potential role of a 14-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the HLAG-3_UTR region in conjunction with IL10 gene promoter polymorphisms (-1082 A/G, -819 C/T and -592 C/A) on respiratory allergy development. The association study involved 125 patients suffering from asthma and/or rhinitis, all monosensitized against Derp 1 and 74 matchedcontrols, all originating from Algeria. PCR-based techniques were used to assess the HLAG and IL-10 genotypes. While the IL-10 promoter allele or genotype frequency did not differ between patient and controls, the 3_UTR +14-bp insertion allele was significantly more frequent in the patient group than in the control group (Pc = 0.01) with the homozygous state of the 3_UTR -14-bp deletion allele being more prevalent in the healthy controls (Pc = 0.04). Our findings suggest that HLA G gene may participate in the pathogenesis of respiratory allergic diseases in our population. A possible mechanism that could be envisaged is that the diminished immunosuppressive activity, mediated by HLA-G, may contribute to initiation/persistence of chronic airway inflammation in asthma.",

Background: Although sensitization to Ascaris may not play a role in the severity of asthma, it may be implicated in total and specific IgE levels to common aeroallergens. Objective: To determine sensitization to the mite species D. pteronyssinus and B. tropicalis in patients who have a positive, or negative specific IgE determination to Ascaris spp. Methods: We analysed 852 consecutive patients (417 males and 435 females; mean age 18.5 years; ranging from 9 months to 82 years. 518 children (302 boys and 216 girls) with allergic asthma and/or rhinoconjunctivitis with or without eczema were included. Patients were separated into 2 groups. Group A consisted of Ascaris spp. positive patients and Group B of patients with a negative specific IgE determination (Phadia) to Ascaris spp. Conclusion: Sensitisation to Ascaris spp. seems to play an important role in rising total, as well as specific IgE levels to D. pteronyssinus and B. tropicalis. Statistically, more patients were sensitized to mites in the Ascaris spp. positive than in the Ascaris spp. negative group. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be established.",

Dr. Beckmann Pharma GmbH, Research & Development, Seefeld, Germany. Background: Sensitization to allergens of the nematode Ascaris spp. is common in the tropics, where a large proportion of the population has been in contact with this, and other intestinal parasites. It has been suggested that sensitization to Ascaris spp. allergens may influence the allergic response to other allergens. Objective: To study specific IgE levels to Ascaris spp. in a large population of individuals consulting for allergic respiratory complaints in an Allergy Clinic in Fort de France, Martinique. Materials and Methods: This study has a prospective, cross-sectional design and was conducted from January 2003 to March 2007. A total of 1,060 consecutive patients (507 males and 553 females; mean age 20.41 years; 6 months to 88 years), evaluated for allergic respiratory complaints were entered in the study. Specific IgE to Ascaris spp. was measured by the CAP method (Phadia). Results were stratified by age and sex. Results: A total of 431 individuals; 239 men (47.14%) and 192 women (34.72%) were positive to Ascaris spp. When analysing differences by age, a total of 599 children with G15 years of age were included (349 boys and 250 females). In this population, 271 children (45.24%) were positive, including 169 boys (48.42%) and 102 girls (40.8%). In the group of patients with 915 years of age (461 individuals; 303 females and 158 males), 160 (34.92%) were positive, including 70 men (44.3%) and 90 females (29.7%). Overall, there was a steady decline in the percentage of positive results in males and females until the age of 44. After this age, however, there was a sharp increase in the prevalence of positive results in males. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of sensitization to Ascaris spp. in the Caribbean island of Martinique and confirms that approximately 40% of patients seeking diagnosis, and or treatment, for allergic respiratory diseases are sensitised to Ascaris spp. allergens. In younger children, especially in boys, this prevalence is closer to 50%. Although antiparasitic treatment may be required in these patients, we have not confirmed if specific IgE to Ascaris spp. represents current infestation or the effect of previous antiparasitic treatments, since the majority of children are systematically treated against intestinal parasites in Martinique.",

Background: Helper T cells can be classified into Th1 and Th2 subtypes, which have been shown to contribute to cellular immunity and humoral immunity, respectively. It is currently thought that impairment of the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells may cause immune diseases, including allergic diseases. Th1 and Th2 cells are polarized from naive T cells following their contact with mature dendritic cells (DCs), which are antigen-presenting cells resident at the frontline of immunity. Only mature DCs can activate naive T cells. When the contacted DCs secrete interleukin (IL)-12, the naive T cells become Th1 cells. In contrast, when the contacted DCs secrete IL-4, the naive T cells become Th2 cells. Therefore, the type of cytokine secreted by the DCs is very important. DCs generated from cord blood were previously shown to secrete lower amounts of IL-12 than DCs from adult peripheral blood. The authors suggested that this finding was correlated with the immune status of infants, who have weak cellular immunity and develop allergic diseases easily. Objective: We hypothesized that reduced secretion of IL-12 by DCs from both allergic patients and cord blood would be due to methylation of the IL-12 gene promoter region, and that the allergic status may be attributed to delayed demethylation of this region. To clarify this hypothesis, we examined the methylation status of the IL-12 gene promoter region in monocytes (DC precursors) prepared from peripheral blood from healthy adults (HA) and allergic adults (AA) and from cord blood from normal infants (NI).",

In addition, real-time RT-PCR amplifications were carried out to determine the IL-12p35 mRNA levels in cultured and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes from peripheral blood from HA and AA. Results: Among the three groups, there were significant differences in the methylation ratios at 7 CpGs in IL-12p35 gene promoter region.

Several genes, through association and linkage analyses, have been found to serve as susceptibility factor of atopy. A polymorphism in the membranespanning 4-domains, subfamily A, member 2 (MS4A2 or FCER1B) has been shown to be associated with increased IgE levels. The role of MS4A2 +6960A/ G (E237G) polymorphism in modulating atopic disorders in the Filipino population was evaluated in this study. Methods: One-hundred two pairs of allergic individuals and controls were phenotyped for total serum IgE level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Atopic status was defined by serum IgE concentration 9100 IU/mL. DNA was extracted and genotyped for the MS4A2 +6960A/G polymorphism by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). Allele A was identified after PCR by a 280 bp band on 4% agarose gel and G allele by a 238 bp band. Results: The study population was in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (\u00c2 2 = 0.007521, df = 1, p G 0.05). There was no significant difference in the total serum IgE levels between subjects with AA, AG, and GG genotypes (p90.05). Likewise, allele frequencies of +6960A/G polymorphism did not differ statistically between cases and controls (\u00c2 2 = 2.624, df = 1, p 90.05). Frequency of the G allele was 0.103 in cases and 0.157 in controls (OR = 0.617, 95% CI = 0.342 Y 1.111). Conclusion: The lack of association between MS4A2 +6960A/G polymorphism and total serum IgE levels among allergic individuals in the Filipino study population indicates that the single-nucleotide polymorphism may not directly be involved in the development of allergic disorders.",

Conclusion: Alpha-1-AT Z alleles are more frequent in northern Europe and in Iberian Peninsula. The S variant gives alpha-1 antitrypsin levels of 60% and Z variant 10% of normal (M allele). Therefore a MS heterozygote must have levels of alpha-1-AT around 40% (30% from S allele and 10% from Z allele) and a homozygotic ZZ had levels of 10%. In our cases the patient with the slightest form of alpha-1-AT deficiency has respiratory symptoms and an emphysematous pattern in CT. The theoretical more severe form ZZ homozygotic presented only rhinitis and urticaria without any lower respiratory complaints. That discrepancy could be explained by the nonsmoking habits of the homozygotic patient in contrast with a long history of smoking habits of the patient SZ. In patients even without lower respiratory complaints but presenting less than 1% of alpha-1 fraction in electrophoresis assay of alpha-1-antitrypsin must be done and in cases of low values a genetic study completed.",

Except nutrients milk contains biologically active opioid peptides derived from \"-casein named \"-casomorphins which can exert effects in neonatal gastrointestinal tract as wall as in all organism. It has been suggested that opioid peptides may play the role in regulation of infants' gastrointestinal functions and development and be involved in the process of immune maturation. The content of \"-casomorphins in human milk during maturation phases has not been studied so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the content of \"-casomorphin-5 (\"C5) and -7 (\"C7) in human milk in different phases of lactation. Methods: There have been chosen thirty healthy newborns and healthy mothers who plan to breast feed. The milk samples were collected every two months starting from delivery. The peptides were extracted according to Halwarker and Elliot method, purified by SPE with the use of C18 columns and identified using HPLC. Results: A significantly highest \"-casomorphin concentration was found in colostrums \"C5 = 5,03 T 1.02 2g/ml; \"C7 = 3.10 T 0.892g/ml ) than in mature milk. The concentration of \"-casomorphin in milk collected in the second month of lactation \"C5 = 0,98 T 0,352g/ml; \"C7 = 0.39 T 0.072g/ml) was similar to the level obtained from the fourth month of lactation (\"C5 = 0,58 T 0,21 2g/ml; \"C7 = 0.33 T 0,132g/ml). The level of \"-casomorphin-5 in individual phase of lactation was not significantly different than the level of \"-casomorphin-7.

Background: Breast milk provides the optimal nutritional supply which is critical for the postnatal adaptation of newborns. Although human milk is considered a hypoallergenic food, the proportions of breast-fed children demonstrating symptoms of atopic dermatitis is increasing. The allergy preventing effect of breast -feeding remains controversial and there are no consistent data regarding the degree to which breastfeeding prevents, reduces, delays or increases the development of allergic disease. A number of studies reports suggested the differences between allergic and non-allergic mothers in relation to milk concentration of immunological agents involved in allergic reactions. \"-casomorphine seems to be a milk ingredient associated with pseudo-allergic reactions. Methods: Samples of human milk were collected from 12 volunteer breastfeeding women with a history of allergy and clinical manifestation of allergy to bovine milk proteins and from 30 healthy women. Milk samples were collected in two phases of lactation -first sample -colostrums, the second -one month after delivery. In the allergic group 9 of 12 women had asthma, 4 were diagnosed with allergy to bovine milk proteins; one women had both diseases. All infants mothers of allergic group have presented skin allergic symptoms i.e. atopic dermatitis. The peptides were extracted according to Halwarker and Elliot method, purified by SPE with the use of C18 columns and identified using HPLC. Results: \"-casomorphins concentration in colostrums in the allergic group was roughly similar (\"C5 = 1,58 T 0,402g/ml; \"C7 = 1,67 T 0.422g/ml) and there was no statistically significant difference in \"-casomorphins content between phases of lactation for both investigated peptides (mature milk: \"C5 = 1,63 T 0,642g/ml; \"C7 = 1,26 T 0.642g/ml).

We demonstrated that GpMuc, a 29 kDa glycoprotein found in these seeds, is the immunogen of the antibody that cross-reacts with snake venom proteins. The immunogenic properties are postulated to reside in its core (\"1-2)-linked xylose-and core !(1Y3)-linked fucosemodified N-glycan chains. To verify this hypothesis we investigated fragmented gpMuc for immunoreactivity. Since the same core modified Nglycans in honeybee and vespid venoms have often been considered immunogens responsible for venom allergies, we also investigated cross reactivity between gpMuc and Hymenoptera venom proteins. Methods: 1 mg of gp-Muc was trypsin digested.

Anti gp-Muc IgG only cross reacted with a protein having an apparent MW of 29 kDa when the venom proteins of Vespula polistes, Vespa cabro, Vespula germanica were analyzed and with a protein of 20 kDa in the protein fraction of Apis mellifera venom. Twelve of eighteen patients with IgE positive to one or more Hymenoptera venoms showed IgE and IgG positive to the 29 kDa venom protein of vespids and/or to the 20 kDa protein of Apis venom and to the gpMuc and corresponding glycopeptide. Conclusion: Anti-gpMuc glycoepitope is included in a 1760 Da peptide and the glycoepitope is shared by a similar venom protein in vespids and by a different one in Apis. Second finding: IgE and also IgG cross reaction between vespid and Apis venoms is restricted to one protein. The third finding was the existence of IgE and IgG cross reaction between the cross reacting protein of Hymenoptera venoms and gpMuc, specifically with the peptide containing the glycoepitope. This raises the possibility of using the gpMuc glycopeptide in place of whole venoms for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of Hymenoptera allergies, at considerable saving and with reduced risk.",

Background: Insect sting is a common public health hazard in the United Arab Emirates. However, nothing is known about the demographic, clinical manifestation and management of insect sting allergic patients. Objective: To assess the clinical manifestation of insect sting allergies and its management in Al-Ain hospital. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed emergency department (ED) records of insect stung patients in Al-Ain hospital. A total of 783 patients (Mean age T SD; 29.2 T 12.6 yrs) were seen at the emergency unit of Al-Ain Hospital. Results: Of the total sample, 425 (54.3%) were female. Only 39 (5%) patients of the total were UAE nationals and 744 (95%) were heterogeneous expatriate workers. The site of the sting of 130 (16.6 %) patients was on the leg, 70 (8.9 %) on the arm, 21 (2.7%) on the head, 21 patients (2.7 %) on the trunk, and 12 patients (1.5 %) on the neck. However, a significant majority of the patients 528 (67.4 %) there was no available data with regard to the site of sting. In this study 41% of the subjects had local reactions, 40.4% had urticaria, 4.3% had angioedema, 47.5% had dyspnoea or wheezing, while only 3 patients were presented with unconsciousness. According to Muller classification, 17.8% were of class I severity, 4.2% class II, 36.8% class III and 2.6 % class IV.

Conclusion: Insect sting is common particularly among the expatriate community, often under documented, and of sever presentation.

Introduction: The most commonly implicated insects in stings to humans are the honeybee, yellow jacket wasp and paper wasp. Stinging ants include the red and black fire ants. In Mexico, there are no data on the degree to which the general population is affected. Methods: A retrospective study, in which a questionnaire was given to all the patients who came to our clinic for the first time for different allergic symptoms, from January 2001 to December 2001 the questionnaire, asks about personal history of hymenoptera sting. We found 72 patients with positive history. Results: The distribution by sex was male (26) 36.1%, female (46) 63.9%. The distribution by insect_s sting was; Ant (58) 80.6%, honeybee (22) 30.6%, yellow jacket wasp (13) 18.15%, paper Wasp (2) 2.8%, none identified (1) 1.4%.

Background: An animal model resembling the human clinical manifestations of allergy is needed for various aspects of allergy research, e.g. for investigating mechanisms and pathway of immunopathology, measuring allergenicity of a protein, testing drug and vaccine therapeutic efficacy. Objective: To develop a murine model of cockroach allergy. Materials and Methods: Individual BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with three doses, i.e. on days 0, 7, and 14, of alum adjuvanted-crude extract of American cockroach (CR), Periplaneta americana, which is the predominant CR species in Thailand. The animals were subsequently aerosolically challenged on days 21 and 22 with 10 ml crude CR extract (1.0% w/v in PBS), using a home-made air-pressure nembulizer for mice. The mice were bled and sacrificed on day 23. Their serum samples, broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lungs were collected. Control mice received only alum i.p. and aerosolic PBS via the nembulizer. Results: All CR extract treated mice showed features of allergy. Their BALF contained inflammatory cells that out-numbered those of the non-allergic counterparts as determined by differential cell counts after cyto-spinning and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Most of the cells were eosinophils. Eosinophil infiltration was also pronounced in the lung tissues of the CR extract treated mice and was negligible in the tissue of the controls. Levels of serum IgE specific to the American CR extract rose significantly above those of the control levels. Conclusion: A murine cockroach allergy model with features resembling the human allergic manifestations was successfully developed. The model can be used for study of various attributes of CR allergy, e.g. allergenicity of a protein of interest, immunopathology, and drug and vaccine therapeutic efficacy.",

Tunghai University, Department of Life Science, Taichung, Taiwan. Background: Forcipomyia taiwana (F. taiwana) is a tiny (1Y1.5 mm) bloodsucking midge that is widely distributed in urban and suburban Taiwan as well as in southern China. F. taiwana attacks in groups to exposed parts of the human body during the day, causing intense pruritis and swelling in sensitive individuals. There are two types of reactions after midge bite: 1) immediate reaction: large local swelling develops within one hour of bites 2) delayed reactions: intense itching papules and vesicles occur 6Y24 hours after bites. The delayed lesions may turn centrally necrotic and last for weeks or even months. We have previously reported that about 59.1% of the exposed subjects develop hypersensitivity reactions to F. taiwana bites. Among which, about 14% developed immediate reaction only, 43% developed an immediate reaction followed by delayed reactions and 43% developed solely delayed reaction. Our previous study suggested that the immediate large local reaction is IgE-mediated and the 24-, 35/36-and 64-kDa proteins are major IgE-binding allergens. However, from our previous studies, we also found that delay reactions to F. taiwana bites may not react through the IgE pathway. Delay itching skin papules or vesicles usually last for weeks or even months that causing an even greater impact on patient's quality of life than the rapidly resolved immediate reaction.Except some limited studies focused on the immunologic mechanisms to mosquito bites, there has been no report in the literature regarding the immunologic mechanisms to biting midges. Materials and Methods: Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from midgeallergic patients with delayed reactions were cultured with media only, Con A or F. taiwana crude extract at different time points. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Change of cytokines in culture supernatants was measured using fluorescent bead immunoassay. Results: In the present study, we demonstrate that peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from delayed typed midge-allergic subjects proliferate and secret more interferon-! (IFN-!), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in response to crude F. taiwana extract. IL-4 and IL-5 were not detected in the culture supernatants. Conclusion: The delayed reactions of F. taiwana bites may be mediated by a more Th1 type cells. The role of IL-10 in midge-bite allergy requires more investigation.",

Introduction: A 67 year-old farmer was transferred to our clinic after an outpatient operation on his right middle ear (stapes reconstruction) that showed an intraoperative strong bleeding. During the exploration of the ear in our operation room a damaged raised bulb of the jugula vein could be detected. The lesion was closed by conventional bone wax, fibrin glue and perichondrium. Follow Up: Ten days after the removal of the endaural tamponade the patient complained of chronical otorrhoea of the operated ear that showed resistance to any treatment. The examination showed a distinct inflammation of the external and middle right ear with a clear secretion. During the operative revision of the situs an extensively grown granulation tissue around last bits of the applied bone wax was seen. After its removal the defect was closed by cartilage of the tragus. Diagnostic Investigation: After the second operation the patient mentioned a previously known bee venom allergy he had not mentioned in the first examination. Recurrent anaphylactoid reactions had happened on bee stings. We decided to get into contact with the producer of the bone wax. We experienced that the used common bone wax consists of 80% of bee wax and 20% of isopropylpalmitate.",

Background: Elevation of basal serum tryptase as a one of signs of systemic mastocytosis (SM) can be a risk factor for the reaction severity in patients allergic to Hymenoptera venom (HV). The exact pattern of the relationship between elevated basal tryptase and anaphylaxis is not completely understood. We focused on the relationship between serum basal tryptase and patient_s clinical data, severity of systemic allergic reactions (SAR) and safety of venom immunotherapy. Patients and Methods: We analyzed data from 69 consecutive patients with SAR due to HV allergy. 27 men and 45 women were included; mean age 48.26 years, most of them with sensitization to relevant venom allergen (prick tests or specific IgE positive). The IgE and tryptase level was measured by Phadia ImmunoCAP FEIA assay. Results: We found significant differences between mean tryptase values in groups of different severity of SAR: Grade I (mean 4.77 ug/l), Grade II (5.56), Grade III (5.48) and Grade IV (12.67, p=0.035). 10 patients (14.5 %) had elevated basal tryptase (mean value 28.52 versus 5.28 ug/l, p G 0.0001). Patients with elevated tryptase were significantly older than those with normal value (61.3 and 46.2 years, p=0.0049). Two patients were diagnosed by systemic mastocytosis, one by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in two patients SM was not confirmed. Venom immunotherapy was well tolerated. Conclusion: The elevated basal serum tryptase level (not systemic mastocytosis only) can be a risk factor for more severe SAR caused by Hymenoptera venom allergy, particularly at the higher age. Background: Increased serum tryptase (ST) levels and Mastocytosis are described in patients with severe anaphylactic reactions after hymenoptera sting (from 7,3% to 10.5% depending on the study).",

No difference in ST levels was observed after 1 yr immunotherapy in respect to baseline values. Conclusion: In our population cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis appear not to be so recurrent. The only patients with high ST levels were allergic to Vespid venoms. HB patients, despite a higher specific venom IgE levels, did not present statistically more severe reactions than Vespid patients. To note that HB patients lower ST levels correlate with higher sIgE levels. These data suggest that in HB patients severe anaphylactic reactions are due to the high sIgE level and not to a larger number of mast cells which a higher ST level would indicate. is known about the quantitative weight of the different work activities. Aim of study was to evaluate the distribution of work habits among subjects with HVA. Methods: Subjects referred to our unit for suspected HVA underwent the standard diagnostic workup. According to the modality of exposure to hymenoptera stings, they were classified: i) at high risk (subjects working usually outdoors or in places were hymenoptera live): farmers, gardeners, firemen, truck drivers, masons, beekeepers, dustmen; ii) occasionally at high risk (working sometimes outdoors): plumbers, electricians, railswaymen, at low risk (working indoors) students, housewives, clerks, professionals. The distribution of occupations in the general population was provided by the Central Office for the Work Insurance of Regione Veneto. Results: Three hundred and 46 subjects (238 male, mean age 44 T 15 yrs) seen at our unit between 2000 and 2007 were diagnosed as having HVA. All had a clinical history of systemic reactions to stings (20% bees, 17% polistes, 63% wasps), of various grades of severity (56% grade III-IV). Concerning exposure, 23,4% of patients were at high occupational risk (43 farmers, 15 masons, 14 truck-drivers, 4 gardeners, 3 beekeepers, 2 dustman), 8,38 % had occasionally high risk (3 warehousemen, 3 soldiers, 9 factory workers, 1 plumber, 5 electicians, 2 railwaymen 1 agronomist, 5 engineers) and 68,2 % were at low risk. In the general population, wokers not at risk were 91.3%, at occasional risk 0.9%, and at high risk 7,8%. Among the patients at high risk or occasionally high risk (110 patients), 71% were stung only during their work activity. Beekeepers, considered typically at high risk, in our database were less represented than, for instance, masons and truckdrivers. Conclusions. The risk of having HVA is higher than expected in some categories. Also taking into account the limit of such a survey, where the data of the general population may be imprecise, it is clear that some occupations are much more frequent in patients with HVA. Thus, for some categories (farmers, truckdrivers) allergy to hymenoptera venom could be considered an occupational disease. Keywords: Hymenoptera venom allergy, work occupation, risk.",

University of Leipzig, ENT Department, Leipzig, Germany. Background: Patients allergic to hymenoptera venom may develop local or generalized sting reaction or they may show systemic reactions of differing severity. If venom immunotherapy (VIT) is indicated, increase doses are usually given during hospitalisation, because severe adverse reactions may occure. There is a wide range of rush-and ultrarush protocols known. We have tested a 3-day ultrarush-VIT protocol according to its tolerance. Methods: 20 patients were treated with VIT, 4 of them received bee-VIT, 16 vasp-VIT. We administered 15 injections over 3 days. Incidence and intensity of adverse reactions were evaluated. Besides the coherence between cardiovascular diseases (especially hypertension), severity of systemical reaction to the insect sting challenge, specific IgE-level and skin prick test and the intensity of adverse reactions during VIT were determined. Results: In total 3 of 20 patients showed adverse systemic reactions, all of them got a vasp-VIT. 2 of these patients had a third grade anaphylactic reaction (according to Ring and Messmer) due to a hymenopteron sting in case history, 1 patient reported about a first grade anaphylactic reaction. Local reactions to the injections ranged from mild (G5cm) to moderately severe (up to 10cm). There was no obvious correlation between intensity of local reaction during VIT and degree of anaphylaxis in case history. 2 of the mentioned 3 patients showed positive reactions in skin prick test at 12g-dose, 1 patient just reacted at 1002g-dose. The specific IgE-level also showed no correlation to local or systemic reactions. Conclusion: The 3-day ultrarush protocol was well tolerated by our patients. We noticed 3 systemic reactions. This is in accordance with the data of studies in literature. Due to the small number of current participants we can find no connection between the incidende of systemic reactions during VIT and the other facts examined. The only noticeable fact was that 2 of 3 patients with systemic reaction during treatment reported about third-degree anaphylactic reaction by first sting challenge. Local reactions to the injections showed moderate intensity, there were no skin effects more than 10cm.",

Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of skin Prick sensitivity and RAST (UniCap-Pharmacia)to Blattela germanica, Blatta orientalis,Periplaneta americanain patients with rhinitis and / or asthma living in Reunion Island (Indian Ocean). Methods: Patients were 51 male, 53 female, aged 5 to 65 years (mean age of 29.6 years) were evaluated in one private clinic and in one public hospital: 18.2% had asthma, 32.5% rhinitis and 49.3% rhinitis and asthma. They were considered sensitized if the prick test induced a papula with at least one half the area of papula induced by histamine, or , if specific IgE was superior to 0,70 KU A/L. Skin tests were conducted with extracts of B. germanica, B. orientalis, P. americana and a battery of common aeroallergens (Allerbio, ALK Abello, France). Results: A positive skin test was recorded in 98 patients (94.5%), 87% of which were positive to mites, 15% to pollens, 9% to moulds, 4.8% to epithelia and 51.9% to at least one of the cockroach species tested; 24.9% of these patients was sensitized to all 3 cockroaches and 27% were sensitized to just one species.The prevalence of sensitization to the respective species was: 41.8% to B. germanica, 33.9% to B. orientalis, 39.8% to P. americana.

Background: People frequently experience whealing and delayed papules from mosquito bites. Whealing is mediated by antisaliva IgE antibodies and histamine. Rupatadine is a new antihistamine and PAF antagonist effective in allergic rhinitis and urticaria but the effect on mosquito-bite allergy is not known. Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was performed with rupatadine 10 mg and matched placebo in 30 mosquito-bite-sensitive adults. The mean age was 37 years and the subjects had suffered from harmful mosquito bites for a mean of 15 years. Either rupatadine or placebo was taken at 8 am for 4 days, followed by a 5 day wash out period and then alternative treatment was given for 4 days. On day 3, in the both drug periods the subjects received two Aedes aegypti mosquito-bites on the forearm. The size of 15 min bite lesions and intensity of pruritus (VAS) were measured. Results: 27 subjects could be analysed for the efficacy. Rupatadine decreased the size of 15 min wheals by 43% compared to placebo. This effect was significant (P = 0.0065) whereas the effect on accompanying pruritus did not reach statistical significance although there was a favourable trend (P = 0.0621). Conclusion: The present placebo-controlled study in mosquito-bite-sensitive adults shows that prophylactically given rupatadine 10 mg is an effective treatment for the mosquito-bite whealing. Background: Atopic dermatitis represents a chronic inflammatory skin disease which results from complex interactions between genetic and environmental mechanisms. Referring to this the colonization and infection with staphylococci is a serious issue in skin disorders especially atopic dermatitis (AD). Human skin epithelium provides a mechanical barrier to invading bacteria and also participates in innate immune defence by producing cationic antimicrobial peptides, e.g. \"-defensins (hBD) and the cathelicidin LL-37. The aim of our study was to determine the potential virulence of staphylococci from AD patients in bacterial skin infections and to examine the innate immune response to infection through expression of antimicrobial peptides. Methods: Identification of the staphylococci was performed by using T-RFLP analysis of the gap gene. Pathogenicity profiles of Staphylococcus spp. isolated from AD patients were determined by screening genes for staphylococcal enterotoxins (sea-see, seg-sej), toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (luk-PV) by PCR. A model of bacterial skin infection was used to test the pathophysiology of these isolates in a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), including the induction of hBD-1, hBD-2, hBD-3, LL-37, IL-6 and IL-8 (real time PCR, ELISA) and cellular invasion (fluorescence staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy).",

Background: Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune, intraepithelial, blistering disease affecting the skin and mucous membranes. It is mediated by circulating autoantibodies (IgG) directed against keratinocytes cell surfaces and potentially life-threatening. PV antibody binds to the keratinocyte cell surface molecules Desmoglein-1 and Desmoglein-3 (Dsg-1 and Dsg-3). In India the incidence of PV is 86% with the mean age 30Y40 years while in Western countries is 40% only with the mean age 50Y60 years. Methods: So it is very important to identify the implicated antigens in PV patients and diagnosis the pattern of expression of Dsg1 and Dsg3 in patients suffering from bullous diseases.

Cytokine profiling for confirmed PV cases from sera showed direct evidences for the involvement of auto reactive T cells responses to Dsg-3, which may be critical for pathogenesis of PV. Among its other biological activities IL-10 also induces B-lymphocytes to proliferate and differentiate to produce antibodies, which may play a important role in production of auto antibodies for PV.",

Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease in children, characterized by intra-alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material that positively stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). The susceptibility to pulmonary infection is a salient feature of the disease which could be partly explained by defective alveolar macrophage function. Methods: We report a case of PAP and chronic interstitial pneumonitis in a girl who presented with chronic respiratory distress since the age of 5 months. Her clinical condition progressively worsened with chest radiograph showing diffuse hazy opacities of both lungs. High resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) of the chest demonstrated crazy-paving pattern.

We report our experience in treating a patient with severe eczema, recurrent bacterial infections, chronic otitis media, IgG2/IgG3 subclass and IgM deficiency with monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion. Methods: An 8 year-old boy was a case of long standing severe eczema with multiple food and drug allergies since 2 years of age. He had had chronic otitis media for the past 2 years. His treatment included elimination of suspected foods and drugs, topical corticosteroid, oral antihistamine and topical calcineurin inhibitor without satisfactory improvement. He was admitted several times due to bacterial skin infections with which he developed Acenitobacter septicemia on one occasion. His CBC did not show thrombocytopenia (platelet 300,000 /mm3) nor small platelets. Immunoglobulins were: IgG 1,480 mg/dl, IgG1 1,030 mg/dl, IgG2 115 mg/dl, IgG3 10.7 mg/dl, IgG4 18.3 mg/dl, IgA 142 mg/dl, IgM 18.3 mg/dl, and IgE 8,080 mg/dl. Specific IgE for egg white and cow's milk were positive. Immunophenotype revealed: CD3 692 cells/mm3, CD4 284 cells/mm3, CD8 351 cells/mm3, CD19 378 cells/mm3 and NK cell 193 cells/mm3. Lymphocyte proliferative response to PHA was below normal. The antibody response to pneumococcal vaccine increased 8.1 folds after receiving conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. Results: IVIG infusions at 400 mg/kg were given every four weeks. The patient's skin lesions were gradually improved after the 4th dose of IVIG infusion. Conclusion: The patient who presented with severe eczema and recurrent infections should be evaluated for immunodeficiency. The mechanism of beneficial effect of IVIG therapy in this patient was unknown but could be due to prevention of infection and its anti-inflammatory effects.",

Medical University, Internal Diseases, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine. Background: Scleroderma, a debilitating acquired connective tissue disease, is characterized by fibrosis, particularly of the skin and lungs. The cytokine disbalance is one of the main manifestation of scleroderma. The treatment of this pathology is very difficult problem for therapy. Objective: To compare the long-term effects of infusion of alprostadil with those of oral pentoxyphyllin on the production of cytokines in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), and evaluate their relationship with effects of the two treatments on clinical parameters. Methods: The production of cytokines by alloactivated circulating mononucleated cells was assessed before and after one year of treatment in a subset of 50 patients enrolled in a one-year study. Twenty five patients were treated with a 10-day (100 mkg) infusion of alprostadil -synthetic analog of prostaglandin E2. Another 25 patients were treated with an oral slow-release formulation of pentoxyphyllin, 600 mg twice daily. Quantitative determinations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the serum of patients were performed with a ELISA. Results: The production of IL-1beta was significantly lower in the alprostadil group than in the pentoxyphyllin group. Both the cutaneous fibrosis and the capillaroscopic patterns were better in patients treated with alprostadil. There was significant positive covariance between IL-1beta and TNF-alpha changes and the changes in both the skin score and the capillaroscopic score. Conclusion: There are several mechanisms by which alprostadil could exert its clinical efficacy. Vasodilatation and inhibition of platelet aggregation are certainly important, but they are transient. We suggest that the long-lasting modulation of the cytokine network observed in the present study could be another potential mechanism responsible for the persistent efficacy of alprostadil despite its administration.",

Patients and Methods: 105 hypertensive pts (mean age 61.3 yrs.), with CHD+ CHF were investigated. In the NYHA classes I/ II/ III/ IV were 20/31/46/8 pts. The C group was represented by 20 healthy volunteers. Ultrasound assessment of flow mediated dilation (FMD) of brachial artery was used for the measurement of EDV and the response to isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) for the measurement of EIV. sTNF-Rs and hsCRP were examined by the ELISA method. Results: FMD was significant diminished in hypertensive pts.

Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the serious autoimmune disease that primarily affect young women. Although cyclophosphamide improves outcome of SLE, frequent ovarian toxicity is a major side effect of this therapy. Cytochrome P450 (CYP), CYP2C19 polymorphism has been shown to significantly influence the pharmacokinetics as well as the ovarian toxicity of cyclophosphamide in Caucasian SLE patients. Objective: To assess association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and ovarian toxicity in Thai SLE patients who have been treated with cyclophosphamide. Patients and Methods: Female patients who were diagnosed as SLE according to ACR criteria and treated with cyclophosphamide were genotyped for CYP2C19 polymorphism. Ovarian toxicity was defined as sustained amenorrhea for more than 12 months occurring before 50 years of age or lack of menstruation for more than 4 months during treatment. Chi-square test was used for assessing association. Logistic regression was applied. Results: Seventy-one patients were enrolled for analysis. The mean age at diagnosis and starting cyclophosphamide was 26.42 T 8.35 and 29.27 T 7.82 years. The mean cumulative cyclophosphamide dosage was 23.36 T 20.81 grams. Thirty-six (59.7%) patients developed ovarian toxicity. CYP2C19*2 allele frequencies were 27.8% and 21.4% in ovarian and non-ovarian toxicity groups. Genotype frequencies in non-ovarian toxicity group were complied with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.304). ROC analysis was applied to calibration cut-off of cyclophosphamide dosage and found that dosage of 23.75 grams yielded likelihood ratio for developing ovarian toxicity of 3.5. Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess interaction effect between cyclophosphamide dosage and CYP2C19 allele. We found that among CYP2C19*1 allele, patients received cyclophosphamide 23.75 grams or higher were 12.6 (95% CI = 3.3Y46.8) times more likely to have ovarian toxicity than patients received cyclophosphamide G 23.75 grams. This risk was decreased to e 5.1 (95% CI = 1.1Y22.7) times if patients had CYP2C19*2 allele. Conclusion: Cyclophosphamide dosage of 23.75 grams or higher carries a high risk of inducing ovarian toxicity. However, the risk can be decreased if patients have CYP2C19*2 allele. Background: Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is a distinct clinical entity and appears to be a specific subtype of asthma. There are lots of efforts to uncover AIA pathogenesis, but adverse reaction by aspirin is still remains unclear. Aspirin is a well known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The antiinflammatory action of aspirin generally has been attributed to direct inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). AIA takes part in 10% of patients with severe asthma. Theophylline has been demonstrated to have an antiinflammatory effects as an long-term medication for severe asthma and COPD. It works as a PDE inhibitor and a nonspecific adenosine receptor antagonist. Objective: To assess the therapeutic effects of aspirin, theophylline, and combination of two drugs in murine model of asthma. Methods: To generate a murine model of asthma induced by LPS with OVA, 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were sensitized intranasally with 75 ug of OVA on days 0, 1, 2, and 7 with or without LPS, and then challenged intranasally with 50 ug of OVA on days 14, 15, 21, and 22. Whenever mice were challenged, aspirin (10mg/kg), theophylline (10mg/kg), and both were injected intraperitoneally. Asthmatic phenotypes such as lung inflammation using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellularity, cytokine production, and lung histology were evaluated on day 24. Results: Total cell number of BAL fluids in mice treated with each of Aspirin and theophylline was significantly decreased compared with non-treated group of mice. However, inflammatory cells in BAL fluids were increased in mice treated with aspirin and theophylline combination. And similar results were represented in histology. IP-10 protein, downstream of IFN-gamma, was decreased in each aspirin and theophylline treated mice compare with each of aspirin and theophylline non-treated group of mice. However, aspirin and theophylline combination treated mice were represented increase of IP-10 level in BALF. Moreover, only aspirin and theophylline combination treated mice were revealed specially increased level of 15-epi-LXA, which generated from lipid metabolite by aspirin. Conclusion: In murine model of asthma enhanced by LPS and OVA, each of aspirin and theophylline treatment is effective, but combinative treatment resulted in adverse reaction.",

Background: Beta-thalassemia major is one of the major health problems in our country. Many studies have confirmed the fact that, these patients have an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Objective: In this study, we have assessed the humoral immune system in 68 thalassemic patients by measuring their serum concentration of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, IgA, C3 and C4 in order to find out a responsible immune defect. Methods: Sixty eight beta-thalassemia major patients were enrolled randomly from referrals to Dastgheib clinic of thalassemia. The same number of case controls with matched age and sex were selected from healthy-people without any history of recent or recurrent infections. Serum IgG, IgM, IgA, C3 and C4 levels were assessed using Single Radial Immunodiffusion (SRID). Results: Serum levels of IgG, IgM and IgA were significantly higher (P G 0.01) and those of C3 and C4 were significantly lower (P G 0.01) in thalassemic patients than the controls. Considering the result of analytic tests, it was revealed that, thalassemia patients show much more increase in serum immunoglobulin levels as they get older. Splenectomized patients had higher serum IgG and IgA levels than non-splenectomized patients but had no difference in serum IgM, C3, and C4. Serum ferritin level had no correlation with the changes of humoral immunity; however, patients with serum ferritin level 9 2500 ng/ml had higher serum IgM level. Conclusion: These results can be due to continuous exposure to antigens, repeated infections, chronic liver disease and splenectomy but not iron overload. The only probable cause of humoral immune deficiency found in these patients is a defect in serum complement levels.

Introduction: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a rare disease described as follows: an acute febrile illness with severe hypoxemia, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, an increase in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosino-phils, no evidence of infection, asthma or atopic illness and complete resolution after treatment with corticosteroids. It is suggested that AEP is an acute hypersensitivity reaction to an unidentified inhaled antigen. We report a case of AEP that developed after Narghile water pipe smoking (WPS). Case report: An 18-year-old woman was admitted with a cough and high fever for the last 4 days. She had no previous history of asthma or atopic disease. There was no history of smoking, recent traveling or using medications. During the week before her admission she smoked a narghile water pipe. The patient was in moderate general condition, dyspneic, RR 20, Sat O2-90% in room air, T-38-C. The physical examination was unremarkable besides bilateral inspiratory rales. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral ground glass opacities. Peripheral WBC count was 14370 cell/mm 3 with 1465 eosinophils/mm 3 (10 %). IV antibiotics, oxygen support and inhaled bronchodilators were administered. Blood cultures were negative. The eosinophil count rose to 3700 eosinophils. Total IgE level was 943 IU/ml (normal range 0Y100). A chest CT scan revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities with no lymph node enlargement. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed and BAL yielded 80% eosinophils. IV corticosteroid therapy was given with remarkable improvement. The peripheral blood eosinophil count returned to normal (1.7%) in two days. The patient was discharged in good condition and 3 months later she was asymptomatic. Discussion: Our case met the 6 diagnostic criteria of AEP: an acute illness of short duration, high fever, severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs, eosinophilia more than 25% on BAL, and no history of drug hypersensitivity or evidence of infection. There are reports of AEP in new cigarette smokers. Narghile tobacco smoke contains tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and heavy metals and it is higher than in cigarette smoke. Water-pipe smokers may absorb higher concentrations of these substances due to the mode of smoking (higher frequency of puffing, depth of inhalation).",

The concentrations of ECP and cytokines (interleukin-4 (IL-4), granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin 5 (IL-5)) in sera from patients with Kimura's disease were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The density eosinophils and the degree of activation of eosinophils in the tissue were also studied immunohistochemically. The concentration of ECP in sera from patients with Kimura's disease was significantly higher than that in the control group (p G 0.05). At the time of the remission, a significant decrease of ECP was observed. In interfollicular areas, most infiltrated eosinophils were positive for EG2 antibody (64.0Y94.0%) and the mean percentage of EG2-positive eosinophils was 75.7%. The concentrations of IL-4, GM-CSF, and IL-5 in sera from patients with Kimura's disease were within normal ranges or below the detectable level in all sera examined. Our findings suggest that eosinophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of Kimura's disease and ECP may be used as an additional parameter of disease activity.",

These measurements were performed in the initial stage of the disease, without using any antiinflammatory non-steroidal therapy for at least 1 month before our study began. The concentration of OPG in the sinovial fluid represented 14.25 T 0.75 pmol/l while in the serum the concentration was 1.69 T 0.80 pmol/l, which was significantly increased (p G 0.001) compared to the values determined in the serum of healthy controls (1.19 T 0.30 pmol/l). The increase of OC concentration evolves in the same manner in both sites of our measurements, the values being of 6.43 T 4.80ng/ml and 19.9 T 4.8ng/ml respectively, compared to the values determined in healthy controls, in the sinovial liquid (G 0.5ng/ml) and in the serum (3.1 T 0.1ng/ml). Background: Undernutrition in children is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and depressed effect on cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Probiotics can enhance immune responses which can lead to illness prevention or decrease duration and severity. Objective: The study aims (1) to determine baseline immune markers (CD3,CD4, CD8, CD19, CD 20, CD56) of undernourished Filipino children aged 3Y5 years old (2) to determine whether probiotics can enhance immunity by (a) changes in immune markers, (b) changes in weight and (c) decreased incidence and duration of common infections (e.g., colds, pneumonia and diarrhea). Methodology: Undernourished children were randomized into control and experimental group. Probiotics (mixture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L casei subsp rhamnosus, L fermentum, L plantarum, Bifidobacteria bifidus, B breve, B infantis, B longum, and B lactis.) were given 2 times a day for eight weeks. Weekly weight, incidence and duration of illnesses were recorded. Blood for immune markers was drawn before and after the study. Results: 29 children were enrolled, 14 in the control and 15 in experimental group. The basal levels CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD 20, CD56 were normal in both groups. The control group showed an increase in CD4, CD8 levels compared to the probiotics group but both groups' levels stayed within normal limits. The probiotics group gained significant weight by 1 kg (p G 0.003). The incidence of illnesses (diarrhea and colds) was the same for both, but there was significant shorter duration for the probiotics group. The median was 2 and 14 days for the probiotics and control group respectively (p G 0.001). Conclusion: Probiotics lead to significant weight gain. They also lead to shorter duration of infections.",

Background: Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) is a rare congenital immunodeficiency with fewer than 200 affected individuals in the world which is characterized by sever recurrent infections. The purpose of this study was to describe the survival time of Iranian patients with LAD over a period of 16 years. Methods: Twenty seven patients with definite diagnosis of LAD (based on standard criteria and laboratory tests), attending Allergy, and Immunology clinic in Children Medical Center Hospital-from 1991 to 2006 ranging in age from 3 months to 24 Years old, were studied and followed. Severity of disease was defined as a presentation of CD18 marker on the surface of leukocyte (less than 1% of normal expression). Also a questionnaire was filled for recording all necessary information. Results: All patients (63% male, 37% female) was LAD type I. The prevalence of consanguineous marriage was 81.5%. The mean age at the time of disease onset was 0.78 T 2.03 months and the mean age of diagnosis was 1.33 T 0.55 months. Overall 33.3% of patients (9 patients) had severe form of disease. The overall 5 year survival rate was 67% and mortality rate was 22.2%. The mean of survival time for alive patients was 73 T 27 months (CI:21Y125). The main leading cause of death was bacterial infections. Conclusion: Mortality rate in other studies mentioned about 4% which is very lower than our study (20.2%). Diagnostic delay can result in high mortality and more complications in untreated patients and failure to provide therapy can be a cause of low survival rate. Therefore early diagnosis, good control and appropriate treatment will improve the survival rate.",

The finding of increased troponin and myoglobin levels on hospital admission, seemed to point to a cardiac ischemia, although ECG showed only sinusal tachycardia and despite of a leucocytosis with 60% eosinophils, Thus, he was directly referred to the cardiac intensive care unit, where he underwent a cardiac catheterization and a stent was inserted in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Three days later, cardiac enzymes started to increase again (troponin up to 64 2g/L) and the clinical picture worsened with severe dyspnoea and fatigue. For this reason, he had a further catheterization done, that showed no problem with the stent. In the meantime, paresthesias and neurological pain, slightly present on admission, worsened to a severe stage. The temperature was still high and cutaneous signs of vasculitis appeared. At this point a cardiac magnetic resonance was performed which revealed a diffuse subendocardic necrosis. Finally, thinking of a Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS), a myocardial biopsy was obtained and ANCA were tested, both confirming the working hypothesis. Moreover, EMG showed a severe mixed multineuropathy. High-dose-methylprednisolone was started, with prompt clinical improvement and normalization of cardiac enzymes in 10 days of therapy. CSS is a vasculitis characterized by asthma, hypereosinophilia and involvement of other organs. Being CSS more prevalent in the fifth decade, when a novel asthma presents in an individual aged 60 or more, it is common to think of a previously latent atopy, made overt by the concomitant intervention of precipitating factors, or of a cardio-pulmonary disease. In the present case report, the steroid withdrawal in a novel asthma of an aged patient caused the burst of a severe carditis in an undiagnosed CSS.",

Methods: we had included questions related to breast feeding in the ISAAC questionnaires (the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood) to see the outcome of allergic diseases in both groups: breast feeding and non breast feeding. Results: Mean (S.D) age: 9 years, weight: 30 kg and height: 135.6 cm. Children breastfed more than 8 months had significantly lower prevalence rates of persistent cough in the past year, ever rhinitis, rhinitis in the past year, and itchy-watery eyes in the past year than those who were not breastfed (18% vs 25%; 22% vs 32%; 15% vs 23%; and 6.5% vs 14.2%, respectively). Incidency was lower of asthma and wheeze in breastfed children than those who were not breastfed (asthma: 2.5y vs 4.5 y; 2.2y vs 3.9y, respectively). Significantly higher proportion of children who breastfed more than 8 months were resolved from asthma, wheeze and eczema than those who breastfed less than 8 months (89% vs 76%; 90.7% vs 77.2%, and 97.4% vs 82.2%, respectively). Conclusion: Our Study shows the impact of breast feeding for at least 8 months in protecting and reducing the prevalence of allergic disorders. Methods: Patient JPA male, 5 years, consulting by Asthma and rhinitis perenneal worsening in fall and winter and a previous history of atopic eczema at 2 years. Objective examination was normal and prick skin tests only positive to house dust mites. Blood analysis were requested. Meanwhile an acute respiratory illness treated symptomatically by G.P. On analysis PBC count was normal, IgG 891 mg/dl IgA 105 mg/dl IgM 155 mg/dl. In electrophoresis a peak was detected which leads to an immunofixation showing an IgMK monoclonal gammopathy. Total IgE was a 160 Ul/ml. Specific IgE 1,5 KU/l for D.pteronyssinus and 2,23 KU/l for D.farinae. A battery of antibodies to Virus, Mycoplasma and Leishmania which is slightly endemic in south of Tagus river was requested. One week after new immunofixation showed a marked decrease of monoclonal peak and IgM decreased to 113mg/dl.

In children the occurrence of monoclonal gammopathies is very rare and mainly described for CMV and EBV. Transient monoclonal gammopathy is characterized by a fast decrease of the monoclonal peak after the infection. In our case a recent Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was shown by positive serology for IgG as well for IgM. This young patient has a slight increased concentrations of total IgE and the values of specific IgE for house dust mites were not very high.

A 14 year old boy presented five years ago with hemetochezia, 5 to 7 episodes per day. he presented severe anemia and he was hospitalized to investigate mieloproliferative disease or systemic lupus erythematosus He was treated with IVIG and methylprednisolone with clinical and hematic biometry improvement. A colonoscopy showed suggestive data of CUCI with diffuse inflammation, pseudopolyps, adhered fibrin to mucosa, inflammatory lesions involving descendent colon and sigmoides, estenotic parts of the colon and bleeding. Hystologic examination described ulcer and inflammatory infiltrate with polimorphonuclears, limphocytes, plasmatic cells in lamina propia and submucosa, mild fibrosis and eosinophils. He received treatment with methylprednisolone, mesalazine, omeprazole, and azathioprine and he was referred. Physical examination revealed severe emation 45.4 kg, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bilateral pulmonar hipoventilation with bilateral crackles. The diagnosis of severe desnutrition, CUCI, and communitary pneumoniae were made, and treatment with cefuroxime and claritromicine was started. He presented fever, rectorragia with hemodinamic compromise that required transfusion of packed red blood cells, and platelets, and involvement of liver, kidney, gut and persistent fever, pancytopenia and elevated ferritin. He required orotraqueal intubation because ventilatory compromise, in the neurology area, he had hypotonic proximal extremities, hiporreflexia, and generalized seizures, which were controlled with phenytoin. The laboratory findings revealed negative, antinuclear antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and anti hepatitis C virus were negative. Central nervous computed tomography showed isquemic temporal areas. Magnetic resonance and angiography revealed microaneurysm in both renal arteries, and vasculitis in central nervous system, hepatic and intestinal arteries. These symptoms and laboratory findings were compatible with diagnostic criteria for childhood classic polyarteritis nodosa, treatment of IVIG and various methylprednisolone pulses let to clinical improvement. Background: According to Evidence Based Medicine, conclusions from meta-analyses and RCT represent the most solid evidence source to assess the efficacy of an intervention.

ALK-Abell\u00f3, Experimental Immunology, HLrsholm, Denmark. Background: Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with allergen extract has been shown to be efficacious in treating allergic rhinitis and asthma. Clinically, SLIT is performed with varying doses of allergen extracts and with varying intervals of dosing, and although a dose-response relationship has been established in SLIT, the importance of dosing intervals remains to be documented. The objective of this study was to explore the importance of the dosing intervals in SLIT. For this purpose we used a mouse model of allergic rhinitis, induced by a clinically relevant allergen, timothy grass pollen extract. Methods: Mice were sensitized to Phleum pratense (Phl p) by intraperitoneal injections of alum-adsorbed allergen extract. Sensitized mice were SLIT-treated with different intervals and with different doses of Phl p extract. In order to study the importance of dosing intervals, doses of 25 kSQ, 58 kSQ or 175 kSQ were given sublingually to mice 7, 3 or 1 day per week, respectively, resulting in a weekly cumulative dose of 175 kSQ for all groups. Two additional groups receiving the lower dose (25kSQ) of Phl p one or three days per week were also included. Following nine weeks of SLIT, all mice were challenged intra-nasally with Phl p. Antibody levels, T cell responses and numbers of inflammatory cells in bronco-alveolar lavage (BAL) were used as read-outs for the efficacy of SLIT in the different treatment groups.",

In addition, the maximal reduction in allergen-induced inflammation in the lungs (BAL) was seen in the group receiving SLIT for 7 days per week. Conclusion: The group receiving SLIT for 7 days per week was the only group with demonstrated positive effects of all immunological parameters measured. Our data demonstrate that although the effect of SLIT is dosedependent when using the same allergen extract, a once daily regimen is more efficacious than regimens where SLIT, with the same weekly cumulative allergen dose, is administered with longer intervals.",

Conventional method of immunotherapy is administered with long durations, rush immunotherapy is super fast methodology in attaining the maintenance/boosting module, which requires hospitalization and other precautionary methods, and multiple allergen vaccines to be administered within short span of time. But in this method which was tried it was found that within a duration of around 15-20 days the relief of the immunotherapy was reached. Place of study: 1) Belle Vue Clinic, kolkata, 2) Hope Super Speciality Hospital, Purnea. Materials and Methods: 62 patients out of which 46 with urticaria allergy and 16 with allergic Rhinitis. Were subjected for Intermittent Rush Immunotherapy schedules. The therapy consists of administration of four vials of allergen extracts, 1st vial : 1:25,000 dil, 2nd vial 1:2,500 dil, 3rd vial 1:250 dil, 4th vial 1:50 dil. The 1st & the 2nd concs were administered in daily schedules in a graphically rising manner. The patients had been given pre-medication before the study. Follow-up of the patients included blood examination IgG & IgE level estimation, before & after 8 weeks after the procedure. Results: Some of the patients showed local skin reactions which subsided on duration of time no drugs were required and 7 patients developed systemic reactions which were managed by Deriphylline & Decdan injections.

However, very few studies have been performed comparing single and mixed allergen immunotherapy in a double blind manner. Here, we have carried out a double blind placebo control trial to assess the efficacy of single and mixed allergen immunotherapy based on various clinico-immunlogic parameters. Methods: One-hundred allergic patients were screened by history, skin tests and specific IgE levels. Sixty patients fulfilling the criteria of the study were divided randomly into two groups Y (a) active-single allergen, (b) activemultiple allergen and (c) -placebo containing 20 patients each. Single allergen immunotherapy was given with housefly extract. In mixed allergen immunotherapy, insect, pollen and fungal allergen extract were used in vaccines. In vivo parameters such as skin test and airway reactivity were assessed at baseline and after 2 year`s of immunotherapy. In vitro parameters such as allergen specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG4 were also assessed. Apart from these, symptom/drug score cards were filled by the patient and analyzed every 3 month. Efficacy of the treatment was analyzed in terms of clinical (skin test, symptom score, and airway reactivity) and immunological parameters (IgE, IgG4, IgE/IgG4, and IgG1/IgG4). Results: Patients getting active immunotherapy in both single as well as multiple allergen group showed significant improvement (pG 0.01) in disease state in comparison to placebo patients. Skin tests and IgE values however showed non-significant reduction compared to baseline. There was a significant improvement (pG 0.01) in airway hyperreactivity, symptom score and IgG4 levels after 2 year of immunotherapy in active group. Also good correlation was observed between symptoms reduction and increased IgG4 levels. All the above parameters were non-significant in placebo group. In the group treated with the single extract, fewer patients suffered with asthmatic symptoms after 2 years of IT and required less medication than in the group treated with the multiple extract. However, these differences, as well as differences in other clinical and immunological parameters were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Both single and mixed allergen immunotherapy for 2 years have shown improvement in clinical and immunologic parameters of asthma and rhinitis patients.",

Antiallergic eye drops which often contain corticosteroids, may temporarily bring relief of symptoms but may bring an early cataract, among other side effects. Allergy testing and immunotherapy based on the test results can cure a significant number of these patients and provide relief to others. Methods: 24 patients of allergic conjunctivitis were subjected to modified skin allergy testing. Out of these 10 patients also had associated allergic rhinitis and asthma. Common allergens found in these patients were: Dust, Dustmites, Pollen, Fungi & Food. Based on test results, vaccines were prepared for individual patients and immunotherapy given. The patients who did not significantly respond to conventional medicines and vaccine, we reviewed the history to discover any missed out allergen. A specially designed indigenous Bpersonal volumetric air sampler^with safranine stained glycerin coated slides inside, was kept in patients home, office and surrounding atmosphere. Results: Out of 24, 18 patients (75%) started improving within 3 months of starting immunotherapy. After 6 months their eye drops and other medicines were stopped. Restricted food items started one by one after 6 monthes. They are symptoms free for last 12 to 2 years. For 6 patients who did not respond to above therapy, specially designed Bair sampler^brought great surprises. The fungi and pollens, which were not tested, previously were found. Also three new pollens were discovered. Appropriate immunotherapy made 5 out of 6 patients symptoms free. Conclusion: Allergy testing and immunotherapy can cure allergic conjunctivitis. Personal volumetric air sampler is a very useful tool to find out additional allergens in case of resistant cases.",

However fewer data were available regarding perennial allergic rhinitis. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the effect of SLIT on symptoms and Quality of Life changes in patients with perennial rhinitis. Methods: This exploratory phase IIIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted during years 2003 to 2005 in the Cape-Town area (South Africa). Sixty patients having house-dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive, during 2 years, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus SLIT solution (Stallergenes, Antony, France), with a maintenance dose of 300 IR (n = 39), or placebo (n = 21). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean T5SS [Total Symptom Score for five symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion; ocular redness/itching/ tearing; itchy nose/throat/ears. The limit percentage of improvement was fixed at 60% for the Bresponders^. Rescue medication intake, individual symptom scores and quality of life (QoL-RQLQ) were assessed as secondary endpoints. Results: The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included 55 patients (mean age: 32.93 yrs T 11.31). The mean T5SS change was lower for the 300 IR [-6.57 ] group compared to placebo [-5.02 ], but the difference did not reach significance. The mean percentage of days with rescue medication, as well as each individual symptom score were lower for the 300 IR group compared to placebo. The percentage of good responders is significantly higher in the active group (p=0.0405). For the QoL, the percentage of good responders the ocular score is higher in the active group (p=0.0512), reaching significance. The association between good responders to QoL and good responders to T5SS gives an odds ratio = 15 (pG0.0001) for all patients (OR = 8.75, p=0.0061 in active group) showing a good correlation. The most frequent adverse events were oral pruritus and throat irritation. No related SAE occurred throughout the study. Conclusion: This exploratory study gives promising results with a two-year treatment using Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus SLIT solution at a maintenance dose of 300 IR three times a week. A population of Bresponders^may be defined as patients with an improvement of 60% or more of the clinical symptoms. QoL is strongly correlated to clinical symptoms.",

In AR QoL is often assessed with Rhinoconjunctivitis QoL Questionnaire (RQLQ)a disease specific instrument. For pharmacoeconomic evaluation a generic QoL instrument must be used. RQLQ only detects symptoms in the upper airways. Due to a strong epidemiologic relationship between AR and asthma suggesting that both are manifestations of the same disease, an instrument also detecting symptoms in the lower airways seems more appropriate. To show the full impairment of QoL caused by AR and to perform pharmacoeconomic evaluation it is important to identify the right generic instrument to be used in clinical trials with specific immunotherapy (SIT). Methods: QoL gain with the grass allergen tablet (Grazax, ALK-Abell\u00f3) against AR was assessed in a randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 634 subjects using the generic EQ-5D questionnaire. EQ-5D contains 5 dimensions: mobility, personal care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, with 3 levels within each dimension. For each of the 5 dimensions the average score was calculated. It was then tested if the difference in scores between active and placebo was significantly different (t-test).",

In recent time the SLIT emerged with patient friendly Immunotherapy. This became a good boon among the children who were depend only on the symtpmatic drugs. This SLIT became an eye opener to Physicians and to parents to control the allergy symptoms. SLIT is introduce in Indian continent and made it possible at affordable price and showed good response in preventing the allergies. Methods: A total 112 children aged about 2 to 14 yrs from various parts of India who were previously diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis and Allergic Asthma and reported receiving allergy and asthma medication took part in this study. These children were tested with aeroallergens by SPT and selected for SLIT who were sensitive to House dust mite (body and fecal matter) sensitivity and among insects who were sensitive to Cockroach. Results: Most of the patients' parents reported with good response and the pharmacotherapy drugs relatively reduced over a period of time and the symptoms drastically came down with increase PEFR. The drop outs were more fascinated to the alternative medicine and they continue to search for the relief from one system to another with continued suffering. Some reported frankly and some said they feel better. Conclusion: The results of this study provide insight into how the SLIT greatly influence the therapy and increase the quality of these children and the normal growth pattern which is appreciated with most of the parents. Background: There are few study comparing the effects of immunotherapy and inhaled steroids. The main limit is the long duration required to fully appreciate the clinical effects of immunotherapy. We compared the effect of inhaled budesonide vs SLIT in mild persistent asthma up to 4 years. Methods: Open controlled randomized trial. Patients with mild persistent asthma and rhinitis solely due to grass pollen were randomized, after a run-in season, to receive either budesonide 800 mcg/day in the pollen season or grass-SLIT (Anallergo, Florence, Italy) continuously for 4 years. Rescue medications were prescribed to all patients. Asthma and rhinitis symptoms were evaluated by diary card may through july at baseline and after 2 and 4 years of study. In-season nasal eosinophils and outseason bronchial hyperresponsiveness were evaluated as well. Results: Fifty-one patients were enrolled and 46 completed. The groups were homogeneous at baseline. In the SLIT vs budesonide group the total nasal symptom score at baseline, 2 and 4 years were: 120 vs 92 (NS), 56 vs 99 (G0.01) and 36 vs 108 (G0.001). At the same timepoints the bronchial scores were 180 vs 161 (NS), 85 vs 138 (NS) and 56 vs 122 (G0.01). In both group there was a significant decrease in the use of bronchodilators and no change in FEV1. In the SLIT group there was a significant decrease of nasal eosinophils vs the budesonide group at 2 and T1. Background: Immunotherapy by sublingual route (SLIT) is nowadays largely employed. Currently by drops or tablets. Sublingual spray has been used for other therapies. This route offers a great potential for immunotherapy increasing the area of mucosal contact with allergen and the rate of absorption. A first trial of SLIT-spray has been done in order to validate safety and patients compliance.",

For mites the vaccine was standardized at 5 mcg/ml for Derp 1+Derp2 and Derf1+Derf2. Cummulative dose at the end of induction was for Derp 1 around 490 mcg (DIATER Laboratories, Spain). The composition of SLITspray was choosen in each case by history, skin tests and specific IgE. The procedure has been carefully explained at all the patients. Daily application for VIALS A,B,C 1 to 4 puffs. D manutention 1 puff daily continued 2 months more. A booklet with instructions was given to the patients and a visual scale from 0 to 5 points marked in a second appointment: convenience, practicability, clarity of instructions and general evaluation.

Larger studies must be done in order to confirm these results. Background: Perennial conjunctivitis due to House Dust Mite is the most frequent form of allergic conjunctiviis in urban environments. However, its diagnosos remains difficult for the ophthalmologists. In India, very little work is done in this field. Keeping this in mind, we have tried to present a case report with Sublingual Oral Immunotherapy. Methods: A male patient, Mr. Pravin J. Patel, 34 yrs,residing at Ahmedabad was suffering from Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis for over 4 years. Routine therapy including local antiinflammatory drops, antihistaminics, etc didn't give him long term relief. The antigenspecific conjunctival provocation test, skin prick tests and ImmunoCAP RAST were carried out with D.pteronyssinus and D.farinae mites. CPT was positive at low dilution allergen of D. farinae and negative for D.pteronyssinus. Skin Prick Tests showed two plus sensitivity to D.farinae. ImmunoCAP RAST revealed Class VI (Very High) sensitivity to D.farinae. Skin prick tests showed one plus positivity and ImmunoCAP RAST showed Class I response to D.pteronyssinus. The extract to be given for SLIT containing D.farinae was tested for Conjunctival Provocation Test and Skin Prick Test to confirm the positivity. The SLIT was given as twice a day schedule,initially in diluted form and later on with increasing concentration. The maintenance dose was then continued. Clinical assessment, Skin Prick Tests and ImmunoCAP RAST were carried out at 6 months and 12 months interval. The patient is still under SLIT therapy. Results: It was observed that the patient was symptomfree at the end of six months and the redness and swelling had totally disappeared. Skin Prick Tests revealed one plus sensitivity to D.farinae at 6 and 12 months interval. ImmunoCAP RAST showed 46.6 kUa/l (grade IV) and 16.5 kUa/l(grade III) at the end of 6 and 12 months respectively. Conclusion: Sublingual ORAL Immunotherapy has shown excellent clinical response with significant improvement in skin prick test and ImmunoCAP RAST test results in case of Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis due to D.farinae.This is an isolated case and much more cases need to be studied.",

            "text": "Safety, tolerability and efficacy of sublingual allergoid immunotherapy starting with a 4-day build-up scheme. Rationale and study design of an ongoing multicentre Portuguese study in allergic patients Rationale: The good efficacy, safety and tolerability of the sublingual monomeric allergoid (allergoid SLIT, Lais\\, Lofarma S.p.A., Milan, Italy), either in tablets or drops, has already been shown in many studies. Yet, so far, only one study on allergoid SLIT starting with a 4-day build-up phase to achieve in a shorter time the maximum suggested dose for the maintenance therapy was performed in 39 allergic patients with promising results. The objective of the present study, still ongoing, is thus to confirm, in a broader population, if this approach is really useful and safe. Study design: One hundred and thirty patients, gathered from the normal daily clinical practice of 16 Portuguese doctors, with an history of oculorhinitis and/or rhinitis with or without mild-moderate asthma, were enrolled during the last 24 months. The build-up rush scheme involved the administration of daily increasing doses of the allergoid SLIT: 500 AU the first day, 1000 AU the second, 1500 AU the third and 2000 AU the fourth. The cumulative dose administered in 4 days was 5000 AU. Also during the maintenance period the treatment dose was kept higher than one normally used. Main endpoints of the study were both tolerability and safety, as well as treatment efficacy. For the evaluation of this one, patient's subjective perception has been taken into consideration as well as the variations in the use of additional drugs for symptom control during SLIT. Results: The final results will be presented at the end of the study in a subsequent poster.

Methods: Paediatric AR patients, with moderate persistent symptoms that are not responding to conventional pharmacotherapy, were enrolled. Other inclusion criteria include house dust mite sensitisation, children 5 years and above, with committed and motivated parents/patients. Doctor visits are scheduled at baseline, 1st, 2nd months and 3 monthly intervals thereafter. An ENT review is performed to exclude any anatomical lesions. Allergy symptom scores were completed for 2 weeks prior to each visit and the mean score calculated. Mean rhinitis quality of life (QOL) questionaires were collected at 6 monthly intervals using a computerised database at the Allergy laboratory. Medication usage and adverse events were documented in a file diary provided. House dust mites allergen extracts (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and/or Blomia Tropicalis) from Stallergenes (Staloral\\) were used, and immunotherapy was initiated as per recommended protocol.\\ Results: 12 patients, 58% boys, were recruited over one year. The mean age was 12 years old (range 5.5Y19 years). All had moderate persistent allergic rhinitis, 91.7% had concomitant allergic conjunctivitis, 33.3% had asthma, and 33.3% had eczema. Most (91.7%) have sensitisation to 2 different species of house dust mites, and were prescirbed separate HDM allergens for SLIT. There is an improvement in the mean allergy symptom scores in most patients during the first 6 months ranging between 28Y53%. There is also a reduced mean QOL scores from 40.4 to 22.7, though not reaching statistical significance. There were no serious adverse events or anaphylaxis during SLIT treatment. The most common adverse reaction is sublingual itch 66.7%, which is transient and easily treated. In addition, there were complaints of mild abdominal discomfort and nausea in 2 patients; urticaria rash in 1 patient. One patient had deterioration of pulmonary function and cough 6 months after SLIT, requiring addition of inhaled corticosteroids for asthma. Conclusion: SLIT is a safe and effective treatment for paediatric persistent AR. Good patient-medical team rapport is essential to the success of such programmes.",

However high doses could lead to adverse reactions, thus the tolerance of every type of extract should be ascertained. Parietaria and grass pollens are two of the most prevalent aeroallergens in southern European countries. In this work, we tried to asses the tolerance of P. judaica and grass high dose SLIT under two induction phases. Methods: Biologically standardized extracts of P. judaica and grass pollen were used to prepare vaccines at a concentration which reached monthly accumulated doses of 20 and 50 fold, respectively, regarding conventional SCIT. Par j 1, Par j 2 and grass group 1, were controlled in the final preparations. Thirty-two subjects received grass SLIT and twenty P. judaica SLIT. Rush schedule consisted in the administration of one drop (50 6l each) the first day, two the second and thus successively until reaching five drops the fifth day. Ultra-rush consisted in the same volumes given all in the same day within 30 min intervals. Adverse events were registered and graded according to EAACI. Results: There was no systemic reaction nor in the patients treated with grass vaccine neither in the patients treated with Parietaria. Only four out of the 22 patients treated with grass vaccine administered by an ultrarush schedule, showed local reactions in the induction phase (3.6% of doses). Over the whole period (6 months), eleven patients experienced some kind of local reaction (itching and/or swelling), that is 0.38% of the doses. There were three withdrawals due to local reactions. In the 30 patients under the rush schedule, 8 local reactions appeared in the build up, that is 5.3% of the doses. In the whole period, local reactions rose to nine (0.25% of the doses). There was only one withdrawal in the Parietaria group of the study due to repeated local reactions. Conclusion: High dose SLIT vaccines with pollen extracts showed an acceptable safety profile administered by accelerated schedules.",

Sublingual sprays have a larger mucosal contact than drops or tablets increasing also the rate of absorption. Therefore this method of dispensing drugs and allergens can also be applied to SLIT. The efficacy of this technique must be assayed. Methods: 40 patients with respiratory allergy, allergic rhinitis, asthma or allergic rhinitis asthma syndrome have been included in the trial. Informed consent has been obtained from all patients. SLIT spray has been given in a standardized schedule from 4 vials in progressive concentrations A-1/ 125, B 1/25, C 1/5, D 1/1. For mites the vaccine was a standardized at 5 mcg/ml for Derp 1+Derp2 and 5 mcg/ml, for Derf1+Derf2 and Derf1. Cummulative dose at the end of induction was for Derp 1 around 490 mcg (DIATER Laboratories, Spain). The composition of SLIT-spray was chosen in each case by clinical history, skin tests and specific IgE. In children less than 10 years half-concentration of SLIT-spray was employed. The procedure has been carefully explained at all the patients. Daily application for VIALS A,B,C from 1 to 4 puffs each day. Vial manutention dosage 1 puff daily. This dosage being attained only after 13 days and continued 2 months more. A booklet with instructions was given to the patients and a visual scale from 0 to 5 points registered in a second appointment to evaluate facility, convenience, practicability, clarity of instructions and general evaluation of treatment. Side effects were registered for all the patients for each dosage. Symptomatic therapy was allowed during trial with anti-histamines nasal steroids, and formoterolbudesonide when necessary. Results: Short-term efficacy of immunotherapy was good in all patients either for house dust mites allergy or pollens. Evaluation by the patients give on a visual scale an average of 3,5 on 5 points (70%). Medical evaluation was of good (12) or very good (24) results in the patients even in the patients treated during pollen season. Only 1 patient withdrawed from the trial due to the tongue swelling and nauseous state. SLIT spray is effective generally well tolerated and very convenient for the patients. Larger series of SLIT-spray must be evaluated in order to confirm these preliminary results.",

Results: We stopped treatment for the period of seasonal manifestations and examined patients again. After comparing results in turned out that the patients overcame the therapy better in the 1 group. The cases of nasal congestion and ocular irritation during treatment were in the 1 group in 0.1% and in 1.2% of patients in the 2 group. No cases of systemic reactions were fixed. The average number of eosinophilic cells in nasal smears in the period of seasonal manifestations was less in the patients of the 1 group (68% in the 1 group and 95% in the 2 one). Patients of the 1 group noted that severity of symptoms and need in additional medication was less then during previous years and patients in the second group did not noticed major changes. The immune system tests showed changes towards Th1 response. Conclusion: We can speculate that these positive changes in immune system of the patients of the 1 group could be the response of lymphoid tissue to the modified allergen stimulation during SIT and the anti-inflammatory effect that lead to better overcoming of the treatment. This shows the benefit of using of modified allergen SIT with Na-DNA salt.",

Background: Recent studies have documented the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in patients with rhinitis, but the value of this treatment in asthma is still debated. We evaluated the efficacy of SLIT in the treatment of allergic asthma in children, by a meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled (DBPC) clinical trials. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up to May 31st, 2006, for randomized, DBPC trials assessing SLIT in pediatric asthma. Effects on primary outcomes (symptom scores and concomitant use of rescue medication) were calculated with standardized mean differences (SMD) using a random-effect model. RevMan 4.2.8 program was used to perform the metaanalysis and we followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and QUORUM statement. Results: Seventy three articles were identified and reviewed. Nine studies, all published after 1990, fulfilled the selection criteria. 441 patients had a final assessment and were included in the analysis. Two hundred thirty two patients received SLIT and 209 placebo. The results of the present analysis demonstrated a relevant heterogeneity due to widely differing scoring systems. Overall, there was a significant reduction in both symptoms (SMD Y 1.14, 95%CI Y 2.10 to Y 0.18; p = 0.02) and medication use (SMD Y 1.63, 95%CI Y 2.83 to Y 0.44; p = 0.007) following SLIT. Conclusion: SLIT with standardized extracts reduces both symptom scores and rescue medication use in children with allergic asthma compared to placebo.",

Lp-Bt5-pulsed BM-DCs showed upregulation of CD86 and MHCII with production of IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-alpha. Lp-Bt5-pulsed DCs were capable of inducing cell proliferation but suppressing Th2 cytokines production by the Bt5-specific Th2 cells. In contrast the wildtype-Lp-pulsed DCs, in the presence of exogenous Bt 5 protein, induced both cell proliferation and Th2 cytokine production by the Bt5-specific Th2 cells. In vivo studies showed that the splenocytes of the mice fed with live LAB-Bt5 produced IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, INF-gamma and TNF-alpha upon stimulation with Bt5 protein. 25% of the fed mice produced detectable levels of Bt5specific IgG1.

Methodology: Prospective, comparative, Cohort study was planned. Sorghum Vulgare pollens are collected and analyzed. For SV pollens SDS page electrophoresis and ELISA_ inhibition assay done and 14Y100 kDa proteins are separated. The SV extract was highly immune reactive and require approximately 7 ng of proteins for 50% inhibition of specific IgE binding in asthma. Immunoblot identified 8 allergenic brands of which 5 proteins (MWs 94, 70, 40, 35 , and 14 kDa) recognized by more than 90% of serum samples of SV pollen sensitive patients. Skin test were done with Modified skin prick test technique. Histamine diphosphate is used as positive control while buffered saline is used as negative control. Testing is performed on forearm. Immunotherapy of above extracts was given by subcutaneous route. Effect of Immunotherapy was studied for 659 patients. Results: Short term (4mth) improvement in clinical symptoms and pulmonary function test (FEV1,PEFT,FVC,FEF25Y 75) is observed. Eleven percent patient (n=4) showed improvement with immunotherapy and 86% (n=13) with Pharmacotherapy. But long term (3yrs) improvement observed in 47% (n=17) with immunotherapy and 20% with pharmacotherapy. Conclusion: MWs 94, 70, 40, 35, and 14 kDa proteins are recognized in sorghum vulgare sensitive patients. Allergen specific immunotherapy is helpful in long term management allergic bronchial asthma due to sorghum Vulgare pollens.",

In this assay we found peptide nonamers from melittin protein of Apis dorsata, which can be used to select for use in rational vaccine design and to increase the understanding of roles of the immune system in allergic reactions. For development of MHC peptide binder_s prediction, an elegant machine learning technique support vector machine (SVM) method has been used. Antigenic epitopes on melittin protein of A. dorsata are important determinants of protection against Rheumatoid Arthritis. As our knowledge of the immune responses to a protein antigen progressed, it became clear that the whole protein is not necessary for raising the immune response, but small peptide fragments 4-AILKVLSTGLPALIS-18 of protein called the antigenic determinants or the epitopes are sufficient for eliciting the desired immune response. We also found peptide nonamers, which are from a set of aligned peptides known to bind to a given major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule as the predictor of MHC-peptide binding. MHCII molecules bind peptides in similar yet different modes and alignments of MHCII-ligands were obtained to be consistent with the binding mode of the peptides to their MHC class, this means the increase in affinity of MHC binding peptides may result in enhancement of immunogenicity of melittin protein. Tertiapin is a neurotoxin from the honeybee venom. It interacts specifically with calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+. Antigenic epitopes on tertiapin protein of Apis mellifera (honey bee) is important determinants sites for protection against disorders. This assay we found peptide nonamers from tertiapin protein, which can be used to select for use in rational vaccine design and to increase the understanding of roles of the immune system in infectious diseases. For development of MHC peptide binder_s prediction, an elegant machine learning technique support vector machine (SVM) method has been used. SVM has been trained on the binary input of single amino acid sequence. In this analysis, we predicted the binding affinity of tertiapin protein having 21 amino acids. We found the MHCII-IAb peptide regions 7-RIIIPHMCW, 13-MCWKKCGKK, 10-IPHMCWKKC, 11-PHMCWKKCG, (optimal score is 0.318); MHCII-IAd peptide regions 3-CNCNRIIIP, 4-NCNRIIIPH, 5-CNRIIIPHM, 6-NRIIIPHMC, (optimal score is 0.202); MHCII-IAg7 peptide regions 7-RIIIPHMCW, 9-IIPHMCWKK, 4-NCNRIIIPH, 8-IIIPHMCWK, (optimal score is 0.805); and MHCII-RT1.B peptide regions 1-ALCNCNRII, 13-MCWKKCGKK, 9-IIPHMCWKK, 11-PHMCWKKCG, (optimal score is j0.730) which represented predicted binders from tertiapin from Apis mellifera protein. These peptide nonamers are from a set of aligned peptides known to bind to a given major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule as the predictor of MHC-peptide binding. MHCII molecules bind peptides Background: The indication to specific vaccination in patients with hymenoptera allergy and concomitant mastocytosis is still a matter of debate, since severe adverse reactions have been described. Methods: We treated with immunotherapy 16 patients with systemic mastocytosis. All had positive bone marrow biopsy and elevated serum tryptase and 3 of them had also positive skin biopsy for urticaria pigmentosa. All the patients (12 male, mean age 51.8 years) have had severe adverse reactions following hymenoptera stinging (Grade IV according to Mueller). Of them, one was allergic to bee, 7 to polistes dominulus and 8 to jellow-jacket. They were vaccinated with a slow-induction protocol (7-week induction phase). Results: Only one patient had systemic urticaria in the updosing phase, that was easily controlled slowing the escalation and giving antihistamine premedication. No adverse event was recorded in the maintenance phases with 100 mcg venom. Nine patients were re-stung while on maintenance. Five had only a mild local reaction, two were stung by a different insect without reaction and two had a grade III reaction. In these subjects the maintenance was escalated to 200 mcg and after further re-sting they had no more reaction. Conclusion: Despite the relative rarity of systemic mastocytosis, hymenoptera venom hypersensitivity can provoke life threatening reactions in those patients. Based on our experience, specific immunotherapy with a slow induction is safe and can lead to an relevant, although not complete, clinical improvement Key words: Systemic mastocytosis, hymenoptera allergy, specific immunotherapy 739 A modified latex hevein (Hev b 6.02) retains lymphocyte proliferation response Rationale: We designed a hypoallergenic Hev b 6.02 peptide by changing all cysteine residues to serine residues with the goal to produce a standardized specific immunotherapy reagent. Methods: Sera of 24 latex allergic patients with confirmed IgE reactivity to MBP-rHev b 6.02 were tested for their IgE binding capacity to the modified hevein peptide by ELISA. BALB/c mice were vaccinated either with this modified Hev b 6.02 peptide alone or coupled to tetanus toxoid. The antibody responses of these mice to natural Hev b 6.02 were analyzed by immunoblot and to MBP-rHev b 6.02 by ELISA. Cytokine production was tested in spleen cell cultures of immunized BALB/c mice. Results: The Hev b 6.02 peptide showed markedly decreased IgE binding (9/24) of latex allergic patients' sera. Immunization with each of the modified Hev b 6.02 peptide formulations induced Abs that cross-reacted with the natural and the recombinant Hev b 6.02. Uncoupled Hev b 6.02 peptide induced lymphocyte proliferation and Th1 (IL-2, INF-+) cytokine production in spleen cell cultures indicating that this peptide was able to induce a Th1 biased T-cell response. Tetanus toxoid coupled modified Hev b 6.02 peptide revealed high titers of IgG, mainly of the IgG2a subclass, to MBP-rHev b 6.02. Conclusion: The ablated allergenicity but retained lymphozyte proliferation capacity of the Hev b 6.02 peptide showed that such a reagent can induce a Th1-biased immune response that is also directed against the major latex allergen Hev b 6.02.",

Materials and Methods: 18 patients were enrolled according to the following criteria: moderate/severe rhinoconjunctivitis, moderate asthma since at least 2 years, sensitization to Parietaria only, age between 18 and 55 years, no previous immunotherapy. After a one-week run-in period where an optimal asthma therapy was prescribed, patients were received either SLIT to parietaria (SLIT-ONE Alk-abell\u00f2) or drug treatment for rhinitis. Control visits were carried out at 1, 2, 6, 10 and 16 weeks (follow-up visit). Quality of life was evaluated with a validated questionnaire (Rhinasthma).",

Starting from 6 weeks there was no more difference in total symptom scores between the two groups. Quality of life significantly improved in the SLIT group if compared with controls from week 6. After 6 weeks SLIT group significantly decreased in drug doses for asthma treatment whereas no statistical difference in therapy dosage was seen in the control group until week 6 the SLIT group had a significant higher use of rescue medication if compared with control group after week 6 the uptake of rescue medications had an inverse trend with statistically significant higher intake in the control group. In the same period there was a decrease in CCR3 and an increase of CXCR3 in treated group these variations became significant at the end of the study from the baseline. No difference in CD4, CD8, CD3, CXCR4, CCR5 expression. Conclusions: This study demonstrates efficacy SLIT when compared to conventional therapy for persistent asthma and rhinitis, correlations between clinical scores and both CXCR3 and CCR3 seen after 6 weeks of immunotherapy in treated patients demonstrate an immunological shift towards Th1 lymphocyte pattern. The new paradigm in vaccine design is emerging, following essential discoveries in immunology and development of new major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class-I binding peptides prediction tools. In this we analyzed MHC binders of neurotoxin M14 protein from Buthus eupeus [Lesser Asian scorpion] are important determinant of protection against cardiovascular disorder. Buthus venom was tested in vivo in anaesthetized rats and in vitro on isolated cardiac and skeletal muscle preparations. In vivo, the venom caused marked rhythmical fluctuations in blood pressure preceding cardiovascular collapse and death. Scorpion toxins constitute a family of homologous proteins that exert potent pharmacological effects on potassium or sodium ion channels. In this analysis, we predicted the binding affinity of B. eupeus protein neurotoxin M14 having 66 amino acids. We found the fragments peptide regions 8-DDRNCVYTCALNPYCDS-24 of protein called the antigenic determinant or the epitope is sufficient for eliciting the desired immune response. The predicted binding affinity is normalized by the 1% fractil. The MHC peptide binding is predicted using neural networks trained on C terminals of known epitopes. In analysis predicted MHC/peptide binding is a logtransformed value related to the IC50 values in nM units. Predicted MHC binding regions acts like red flags for antigen specific and generate immune response against the neurotoxin M14 antigen. So a small fragment of antigen can induce immune response against whole antigen. This theme is implemented in designing subunit and synthetic peptide vaccines. The sequence analysis method is allows potential drug targets to identify active sites against venom action. The method integrates prediction of peptide MHC class I binding; proteosomal C terminal cleavage and TAP transport efficiency. Background: Levels of allergen specific IgE are relatively unaffected by allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT), whereas levels of allergen specific IgG is markedly increased. The effect on antibodies to minor as compared to major allergens is not clear. In this study antibodies towards Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 of Betula verrucosa were investigated in sera of SIT treated patients. Methods: Specific IgE was bound to monoclonal anti-IgE coupled to paramagnetic beads and measured by the binding of 125 I labelled purified natural Bet v 2 and recombinant Bet v 1.2801, respectively. IgE depleted serum was tested for specific IgG and following incubation with the labelled allergen, free and bound allergen were separated by protein G affinity chromatography. Sera were tested in immunoblotting with or without absorption using 1 mg birch pollen extract per serum sample. Results: All sera (n=50) were positive for IgG and IgE against Bet v 1 before and after SIT. The relative binding activities of IgG compared to IgE were up to 30 times higher after SIT. In contrast, 22% of non-treated patients were positive for IgE anti-Bet v 2 and 48% for IgG anti-Bet v 2. At 1.5 years of SIT, the prevalence of IgG-and IgE-anti-Bet v 2 was unchanged, however, after 5 years of treatment, the prevalence of IgG anti-Bet v 2 was 91% but the prevalence of IgE anti-Bet v 2 was unchanged when analysed by quantitative immunoassay. Contrary to this observation, 3 sera became IgE anti Bet v 2 positive after 5 years of treatment when measured by immunoblotting. Conclusion: The dominant binding activity against Bet v 1 and Bet v 2 in sera from birch pollen allergic patients both before and after SIT resides in the IgG fraction. Prolonged SIT treatment induced IgG against minor allergen Bet v 2 in most individuals. New IgE reactivities to Bet v 2 were observed after SIT in 3 patients by immunoblotting, however, this result was not confirmed by quantitative solid phase immunoassay and may possibly indicate differences in assay sensitivity with respect to denaturation insensitive epitopes.",

Background: Various administration schedules of immunotherapy have been reported to be beneficial for the treatment of inhalant allergy: conventional, cluster and rush. The use of therapeutic vaccines containing modified allergen extracts (depigmented and glutaraldehyde polymerised), in which the allergenicity is decreased, and the immunogenicity maintained, allows to reach the maintenance dose using conventional schedules with few administrations in a very short period of time. The objective was to evaluate the safety of a very short build-up phase using these hypoallergenic vaccines containing standardised modified allergen extracts. Materials and Methods: One hundred and nine patients (56 female and 53 male, mean age 29.7 years) with rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma, sensitised to mites and/or pollens were included in an observational cohort study. All of them received an individualised therapeutic vaccine containing depigmented and glutaraldehyde polymerised allergen extract. The patients reached the maximum dose after 2 injections of the vial of maximum concentration (0.2 as the first dose the first day and 0.5 ml as the maintenance dose after 1 week, followed by 0.5 ml after 1 month). The tolerance was assessed by recording all side reactions related to immunotherapy, which were classified according to the criteria of the EAACI. Results: The total number of injections was 327. All patients reached the maximum recommended dose the first week. No premedication with drugs was used before the administration of the immunotherapy. Eight reactions (2.44 % of the total injections) were recorded, 7 local and 1 systemic. The 7 local reactions consisted of 3 immediate (diameter 9 5 cm) and 4 delayed (diameter 9 10 cm). One systemic reaction of grade 2 was reported. This reaction consisted in a slight urticaria that resolved with treatment with antihistamines (ebastine). Conclusion: The therapeutic vaccines containing chemically modified extracts can be safely administered using a fast schedule in an immunotherapy unit, reaching the maximum dose the first week with 2 injections and without the need of premedication and/or hospitalisation.",

Background: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only therapeutic approach in the treatment of IgE mediated allergies which is targeting immunopathogenetic process. Allergen could be administered in several application forms preferentially subcutaneously or sublingually. It is difficult task to follow the efficacy of this immunomodulation. The aim of study is comparison of influence of two different routes of application of immunotherapy on the serum level of allergen -specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies. Methods: Together 62 patients (31 male, 31 female) with grass pollen allergy were enrolled. Allergen immunotherapy by subcutaneous injection (Phostal, Stallergenes) was administered to 21 patients. Allergen immunotherapy in the form of sublingual capsules (Staloral, Stallergenes) was administered to 18 patients. 23 patients were treated symptomatically during pollen season.

The serum level of specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies against immunodominant allergen (timothy grass) was evaluated by diagnostic kit (Dr.Fooke, Germany). Results: No significant differences were found between groups of patients before start of allergen immunotherapy in any parameter tested. There is statistically significant increase in allergen specific IgG in both groups of patients after one year therapy (both pG0.0001) and after 3 years of therapy (both pG0.0001). Statistically significant increase was found in allergen specific IgG4 in both groups of patients after 3 years of therapy (subcutaneous group p=0.0007, sublingual group p=0.042). There is statistically significantly higher level of allergen specific IgG and IgG4 (both pG0.0001) after 3 years of therapy in patients treated by subcutaneous form of allergen immunotherapy in comparison with patients treated by sublingual form of immunotherapy.

University Hospital, Institute of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. Background: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only therapeutic approach in the treatment of IgE mediated allergies which is able to target immunopathogenetic process. Allergen can be administered in several application forms preferentially by subcutaneous or sublingual route. Subcutaneous and sublingual forms are differentially interacting with immune system. Data concerning the comparison of these two forms of application favour studies with clinical efficacy over laboratory studies. Aim: Of this study is the comparison of the influence of two different types of AIT on the serum levels of cytokines IL-4 and IFN+. Methods: Together 62 patients with grass pollen allergy were enrolled. Subcutaneous AIT (Phostal) was administered to 21 patients. Sublingual AIT (Staloral, 100 IR/ml)) was administered to 18 patients, 23 patients were treated symptomatically. Blood samples were collected before the start of study (January, 2003) , after 12, 24 and 36 months. The serum level of cytokines IL-4 and IFN+ was evaluated by diagnostic kit (Quantikine, RDS). Results: No significant differences were found between the groups before the study. There was significant increase of IFN+ only in the group of subcutaneous AIT after 12 months of therapy (p= 0.016) and after 36 months (p= 0.0294). The IL-4 demonstrated significant decrease in the group of subcutaneous AIT after 12 months of therapy (p= 0.022) and in both groups of AIT after 36 months (pG 0.0001), but comparing to control group only subcutaneous AIT group reached significance. Conclusion: The subcutaneous and sublingual applications of AIT after 36 months resulted in the significant decrease of IL-4 in both groups, but decrease of IL-4 in the subcutaneous group was manifested earlier -after 12 months. Expecting increase of IFN + was significant only in group of subcutaneous AIT. Immunomodulation by subcutaneous AIT seems stronger than sublingual AIT, especially in the first year of the study. For continual sublingual AIT are needed higher concentrations of allergens then 100 IR/ml as maintenance dosage.",

Background: Double blind placebo controlled trials of allergy vaccines are considered the better method to confirm his efficacy. An assay of a sublingual monomeric allergoid in tablets was done in patients allergic to grass pollens during 2 years. This monomeric allergoid was obtained by carbamylation of amino groups (lysine) of allergenic proteins. Methods: 33 rhinitic patients allergic to grass pollens as confirmed by clinical history, skin prick tests and specific IgE were included in the trial. Patients were randomized between placebo and active vaccine both given as sublingual tablets administered by the sublingual swallow method (LAIS, Lofarma, Milano, Italy) . A traditional posological scheme was used starting with a very low dose increased progressively in the course of 14 weeks before grass pollen season. Enrolment of the patients was preseasonal followed by a seasonal visit in May and a end of the year visit in October. Patients were followed during 2 consecutive years. Nasal provocation tests with the allergens included in the vaccine was done before treatment and after 1 and 2 years of treatment and symptom scores registered after each challenge. The use of nasal steroids as rescue was authorized for rhinorrea, sneezing and conjunctivitis. Symptom scores for eventual side effects and pharmaceutical scores were registered for each patient. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Results: Results were evaluated after 1 and 2 years of treatment. Between vaccines and placebo the score for rhinorrea (pG0,03) sneezing (pG0,03) and conjunctivitis (pG0,02) was significantly decreased for the second wear of treatment. Between the first and second years of treatment the scores for placebo were not changed but for active vaccine, rhinorrea (pG0,03), sneezing (pG0,03) and conjunctivitis (pG0,02) were significantly decreased. Symptomatic score after nasal challenge was decreased (pG0.03) after 2 years treatment. Nasal steroid consumption were significantly decreased in the active group during May and June both years of treatment (pG0,02). Only two light local adverse events were reported in the active group and none with placebo. Conclusion: Preseasonal treatment with a sublingual monomeric grass pollen allergoid in tablets improved rhinorrea, sneezing and conjunctivitis and reduced the steroid consumption. Tolerability was optimal.",

Background: The grass family Poales contains more than 10.000 species which can be divided into subfamilies based on their taxonomy. One of the larger subfamilies is the Pooideae subfamily also denominated as the temperature pasture grasses. In spite of the large number of grass species, grass pollen allergic patients' IgE show a high degree of cross-reactivity between Pooideae grass species. Currently, immunotherapy for grass pollen allergy is often performed with mixtures of grass species. However, high clinical efficacy of grass pollen immunotherapy (SIT) using Phleum pratense (Phl p) alone has been demonstrated in several studies. The aim of the study was to investigate the antibody cross-reactivity towards Phl p and grass pollen extract mixes. Methods: The amount sIgE reacting with Phl p pollen extract and four different grass pollen extract mixes was determined in sera from grass pollen allergic patients. The capacity of Phl p to inhibit the reaction of grass pollen allergic patients' IgE towards the four grass pollen extract mixes was performed using excess inhibitory concentration of non-labeled Phl p extract. The four mixes each comprised between 5 and 10 Pooideae grass pollen extract species. Phl p SIT induced IgG4 was measured to Phl p pollen extract, extracts of nine individual Pooideae grass species and the four grass pollen extract mixes. All allergen specific antibody assays was performed using an ADVIA Centaur solid phase immunoassay.",

Phl p has the capacity to inhibit the reaction of the patients specific IgE to the four grass pollen extract mixes indicating a high degree of cross-reactivity of the patients IgE. SIT with Phleum pratense induces IgG4 which exhibit a statistical significant correlation (0.92Y0.99, Spearman) in their reaction with the individual nine Pooideae grass pollen extracts and the four grass pollen extract mixes. Thus, IgG4 induced by SIT with Phl p cross-react extensively with both single and mixed grass pollen extracts. Conclusion: Immunochemical and clinical data together support the conclusion that Phl p alone is as effective for allergen specific immunotherapy against allergy to Pooideae grass pollens as any mix or single specie fro the Pooideae family. Background: The clinical efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SIT) in the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases is well documented, but its main drawback of is the risk of systemic reactions (SRs). This 3-years prospective study evaluated the safety of SIT with standardized extracts in real life in patients with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma. Methods: Between January 2003 and June 2006 a total of 248 patients (140 male, mean age 31.4 years, range 7Y65) referred to our Allergy Unit were prescribed SIT for their respiratory diseases. 176 of the patients had seasonal/ perennial rhinitis and 72 asthma with or without rhinitis. Allergen extracts were all standardized by biological methods (ALK-Abell\u00f2 and Stallergenes). 204 patients were treated according to a traditional (12 weeks) schedule, whereas 44 underwent a cluster protocol (7 weeks). Patients were treated for grass (35%), birch (13%), parietaria (31%), mite (21%). Systemic reactions (SRs) were categorized into immediate SRs (occurring within 30 minutes) and late (930 minutes). They were graded in four levels of severity according to EEACI Immunotherapy Position Paper (0= No symptoms; 1= Non specific symptoms probably non IgE-mediated; 2= rhinitis/asthma responding adequately to treatment; 3= non life-threatening SRs, e.g. urticaria, angioedema or severe asthma; 4= Anaphylactic shock). Results: A total of 9,650 injections were administered in the 248 patients. SRs registered are shown in table 1 and divided according to the two phases of the schedule (build-up and maintenance). Results. There were 18 SRs (7.3% patients and 0.20% injections). 13 occurred in the build-up phase and 5 in thye maintenance. SRs were more frequent in females (66%). Grass pollens were most frequently responsible of SRs (65%) than other allergens (parietaria 18%, tree 5%, mite 10%) SRs were Grade 1= 8 cases; Grade 2 = 7 cases; Grade 3 = 1 case, Grade 4 = 2 cases (Epinephrine administered). Both severe reactions occurred within 30 minutes after injection. Late reactions were less common (7 SRs). Conclusion: If properly used, SIT has a low and acceptable rate of side effects. In our population female gender and build-up phase were the two main risk factors. Keywords. Specific immunotherapy, injection, systemic reaction.",

Background and Aim: Probiotics, like lactobacilli have been used as a management strategy for allergy diseases. Its effects on specific immunotherapy have been previously studied in humans. The aim was to evaluate the possible adjuvant effects of probiotics on allergen-specific immunotherapy in an allergy mouse model. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were pre-sensitized by epicutaneous patching with recombinant Der p 2, and subsequently orally fed with either heat-killed wildtype L. casei (Lc) NaHCO 3 buffer for five weeks (n=6 per group). All mice then received two subcutaneous (s.c.) immunizations of Der p 2 to mimic allergen immunotherapy, followed by aerosol challenge with Der p 2 a week later. Results: The Lc fed Der p 2 sensitized mice showed significantly lower Der p 2 specific-IgE and IgG1 after s.c. immunizations and airway challenge compared to the NaHCO 3 buffer control group. Spleen T-cells and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells of Lc fed mice showed suppression of Th-2 (IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-4) and pro-inflammatory (TNF-! cytokines), with an increase in TGF-\" production in MLN cells. In addition, these Lc-fed mice but not the controls showed attenuated lung inflammation as demonstrated by the significantly reduced lung histopathology and total cell count in BALF. These results suggest that combined administration of the heat-killed L casei and allergen could effectively down-regulate the pre-existing Th-2 allergic responses.",

Bejing Children_s Hospital Affiliated to Capital University of Medical Science, Center of Asthma, Beijing, China. Background: To determine the tolerance during dose-increase phase of specific immunotherapy (SIT) with standardized house-dust mite extract in asthmatic children. Methods: Subcutaneous SIT with standardized house-dust mite extract was administrated to 24 asthmatic children with allergy to house-dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus). We monitored the immediate and late side-effects after each allergen injection during dose-increase phase of immunotherapy treatment. Lung function test was done before and 30 minutes after each injection for every patient. Results: All patients completed a total of 370 injections during dose-increase period. 27 injections (7.30% of all injections) caused immediate side-effects within less than 30 minutes after injection in 14 patiens (58.33% of all patients), in which 26 side-effects (96.3% of all early reactions) were mild local reactions (G5cm in diameter) and 1 episode of mild asthma occurred. 21 patiens(87.50% of all patients) reported 38 late side-effects(10.27% of all injections) 30 minutes after injection, 9 late side effects occurred in 7 patiens were mild systemic reactions which included asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis and allergic dermatitis, all those systemic reactions responded well to ordinary treatment. Others late side effects were 28 mild local reactions and 1 moderate local reaction (5cm in diameter). The change rate of lung function parameters after each injection showed a wide range of variance such as FEV1(j18.9%15.8%), PEF(j35.6%33.3%), FEF 25 (j29.5%51.7%), FEF 50 (j38.648.4%), FEF 75 (j49.1%249.2%), MMEF(j38.2%101.7%), but there was no significant difference among all injections during dose-increase period. Conclusion: Subcutaneous SIT with standardized house-dust mite extract showed a good tolerance in asthmatic children. A majority of local reactions and all systemic reactions were mild and responded well to ordinary treatment and adjustment of dose-increase schedule. No significant change of lung function was observed during dose-increase phase of SIT. 45 patients of simple perenial bronchial asthma and steroiddependent bronchial asthma were studied before and after Immunotherapy with house dust mite (D.farine.pteronyssinus) alleregn vaccine.

The two kinds of treatment were efficient and comparable in relation to symptom score, salbutamol use, morning PEFR, FVC and FEV1, but patients treated with IT and ICS had a faster improvement of symptom score and PEFR variability. The interruption of ICS after 24 months of therapy was linked to an impairment of all end points which were more pronounced in patients previously treated only with ICS.

The third-stage larvae are commonly found in the entrails and in the muscles of many fishes and if accidentally ingested can cause clinical disorders and sensitization in humans. Previous studies have shown cross reactivity between Anisakis simplex and different dust mite species. We observed gastrointestinal symptoms during specific immunotherapy for house dust mite in a patient with Anisakis sensitization. In a patient suffering from allergic asthma with sensitization to house dust mite developed gastrointestinal symptoms during Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT). Sensitization was evaluated by skin prick tests with common inhalant allergens, standard food extracts, commercial extracts of Anisakis simplex and Radioallergosorbent Test (RAST) to specific IgE antibodies. We obtained that Skin Prick Tests (STP) with common inhalant allergens were positive to graminacee (++j), cypress (++j) and house dust mite (+++j). SPT with standard food extract and commercial extract of Anisakis simplex demonstrated sensitization to Anisakis simplex. RAST showed specific IgE antibodies against allergens of Anisakis simplex. Moreover, it is important to underline that allergenic cross-reactivity between Anisakis simplex and other nematodes, such as arthropods, is well known. In a recent work, Johansson and his group underlined an association between sensitization to Anisakis simplex and four different dust mite species (Acarus siro, Lepidoglyphus destructor, Tyrophagus putrescentiae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus). In their study, serum samples collected from 69 subjects allergic to dust mites were analyzed for IgE to Anisakis simplex by CAP FEIA and immunoblotting inhibition. They found that 14/69 patients had detectable levels of IgE antibodies to Anisakis simplex. In the CAP FEIA inhibition, all four mite extracts inhibited, to various degrees, the IgE response to Anisakis simplex on the solid phase. In the light of these findings, it is possible to hypothesize that immunotherapy for dust-mite could pose an unintentional challenge in patients with gastroallergic anisakiasis, due to crossreaction with anisakis simplex antigens. Even if further observations of adverse reactions to sublingual immunotherapy with dust mite in patients sensitized to Anisakis are needed, our data suggest that oral treatment should be discouraged in these patients.",

Immunotherapy using depigmented and glutaraldehyde modified allergen vaccines produces clinical benefit, as evaluated by improvement in the shock organ, symptom and medication scores, quality of life and skin sensitivity. Objective: To evaluate the evolution of skin sensitivity in a group of asthmatic patients sensitised to both mites in a double-blind and placebo-controlled study of 1 year of duration. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four patients were included, and 52 finished the study (26 in the active group and 26 in placebo). The native extract of D. pteronyssinus contained 20.35 mcg of Der p 1 and 12.30 mcg of Der p 2, and the D. farinae extract contained 19 mcg of Der f 1 per mg of freeze-dried extract. Due to the polymerisation process, Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der f 1 were not detectable in the modified extract. Patients were skin tested at baseline and at the end in duplicate, on the volar surface of the forearm using the same batch of native D. pteronyssinus extract at 0.002, 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mg/ml. The vial of maximum concentration had a potency of 100 HEP/ml and contained 40.70 mg of Der p 1/ ml and 17.22 of Der p 2. Glycerinated saline solution and histamine HCl 10 mg/ ml were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Skin reactions were recorded after 15 minutes. The results were expressed as the 10 HEP value. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the results. Results: Patients treated with the modified allergen extract received a total accumulated dose of 593 mcg of freeze-dried modified material of D. pteronyssinus and 453 mcg of D. farinae. The active group showed a significant difference from baseline (P=0.029, Wilcoxon), whereas the placebo group did not (P=0.900). The active group needed at the end of the study a median of 21.9 mcg more of allergen extract to achieve the value of 10 HEP, whereas in the placebo group the figure was j0.31. Conclusion: This double-blind placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that the treatment of mite allergic asthmatic patients with a mixture of depigmented and glutaraldehyde-polymerised extracts of D pteronyssinus and D. farinae induces a significant decrease in the skin sensitivity.",

Background: There is limited knowledge about the clinical relevance of a sensitization with domestic mites s.a. Euroglyphus maynei (Em), Lepidoglyphus destructor (Ld), Acarus siro(As) and Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Tp). The efficacy and safety of a SIT with these mites has not been described until now. Patients and Methods: We investigated 107 patients suffering from persistent rhinoconjunctivitis by i.c test, specific IgEs and placebo controlled nasal challenge test with domestic mite allergens. If the patient had a positive i.c test and/or specific IgEs and a positive nasal challenge test SIT was initiated with the respective depigmented polymerized allergen extract. 20 patients have been treated with the following allergen extracts either alone or in combination for 6 months: 9x As, 6x Ld, 6x Tp, 4x Em. Patients symptoms and medication consumption was recorded using a standardized questionnaires. Results: 17/20 patients (85%) improved during the course of SIT. The symptom and medication score was reduced in parallel. 1 patient did not change during SIT and 2 patients were lost to follow-up and therefore considered as treatment failure also. There were no systemic reactions and only few and mild local reactions reported. Conclusion: This is the first report of a successful SIT with Euroglyphus maynei, Lepidoglyphus destructor, Acarus siro and Tyrophagus putrescentiae. The treatment was efficacious and safe.

Materials and Methods: Fifty-one patients were randomly allocated to either receive active treatment (n=26), or placebo (n=25). The native extract of D. pteronyssinus contained 20.35 mcg of Der p 1 and 12.30 mcg of Der p 2, and D. farinae contained 19 mcg of Der f 1 per mg of freeze-dried extract. Due to the polymerisation process, Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der f 1 were not detectable in the modified extract. Patients recorded the symptom and medication scores on a diary card. The area under the curve (AUC) and the number of days free of symptoms and/or medication were calculated for each patient. The values of AUC were compared groupwise using the Mann-Whitney test, and the Hodges-Lehmann estimator was used to measure the effect size. Fisher's exact p value was used for the number of days free of symptoms or medication.",

In highly susceptible or symptomatic patients, allergen-specific immunotherapy may be beneficial, but the data are limited. The present study is aimed to evaluate the role of immunotherapy in cockroach allergic patients using standardized whole body extract. Methods: Twenty patients belonging to allergic asthma, rhinitis or both were recruited in active group and 20 in placebo group. The patients in active group were administered with P. americana extract subcutaneously whereas the other group received placebo injections for one year. To assess the benefits of immunotherapy, the data was analyzed for symptom/drug score, airway reactivity and immunoglobulins (IgE, IgG1 and IgG4) at the baseline and after completion of one year of immunotherapy. Immunoblots of specific IgE and IgG4 were made before and after therapy. Results: Good improvement was observed in clinical status of patients with respect to in vivo and in vitro parameters. Changes in symptom score, airway reactivity and IgG4 values were highly significant in comparison to baseline values and placebo group. Skin test and IgE values showed non-significant reduction. Immunoblotting of specific IgG4 has shown development of more bands of increasing density after 1 year of immunotherapy. While IgE blot showed similar pattern of bands before and after immunotherapy. Conclusion: Cockroach immunotherapy is well tolerated in patients of allergic rhinitis and asthma. IgG4 immunoblotting has shown a correlation of clinical efficacy with the immunologic response.",

Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Medical Science, ?The Fareastern Scientific CentreX, Research Insti, Vladivostok, Russian Federation. Purpose: There were 74 patients with the hospital pneumonia of serious current under our observation. Patients were distributed to the way of introduction of the immunotroping drug. The first group (22 patients) received recombination IL-2 on 500 000 \u00cc\u00c5 dose intravenously. The second group (24 patients) received hypodermic introduction of the same dose of the drug, and patients of the third group (28 person) received the combined introduction of recombination IL-2: 250 000 \u00cc\u00c5 dose of inhalation with the help the ultrasonic inhaler simultaneously with hypodermic introduction of 250 000 Y 500 000 \u00ccA dose. The course of treatment consisted of 2Y3 procedures. The dynamic research of the basic clinic-laboratory indexes were given to all our patients. Results and Conclusion: It was fixed, that all three ways of recombination IL-2 introduction provided positive dynamics of indexes of immunity on the background of basic anti-inflammatory therapy of the pneumonia as the result of our research. However, the condition of the local immunoreactivity of lungs was recovered only at combined inhalation and hypodermic introduction (patients, contents of metabolites of oxide of nitrogen and !1-acidic glycoprotein in the condensate of the exhaled moisture was normalized, reaching similar indexes of healthy people). It is important to note, that complete regress of radiological indexes was only at combined application of recombination IL-2 inhalationly and subcutaneously. The analysis of frequency rate of recombination IL-2 introduction showed, that it was not enough single-pass introduction of the drug for the reduction of indexes of the local immunity, and rates of their reduction in the course of the repeated combined way of introduction were identical and depended on gravity of the condition and the expressiveness of the inflammation in bronchopulmonary system. The increase of frequency rate of recombination IL-2 introduction more than 2Y3 times did not accelerate rates of clinical convalescence, reduction rate of immune indexes and biochemical criteria of the degree of the expressiveness of the inflammation in respiratory paths. Thus, we believe that it was efficient combined recombination IL-2 application of the 250 000 \u00cc\u00c5 inhalation dose and 500 000 \u00cc\u00c5 dose subcutaneously 2 Y 3 times with the interval of 72 hours for treatment of patients with the serious hospital pneumonia. Background: Diagnosis of asthma or non-asthma is critical for clinical research. Using methacholine challenge testing (MCT), a well established bronchial challenge test for assessing airway responsiveness, we have identified groups of patients who have been incorrectly diagnosed as asthmatic or non-asthmatic.

The Impulse Oscillometry Technique (IOS) may be suitable in this application since it allows the assessment of airway obstruction by requiring minimum patient cooperation. Aim: Our aim was to identify the relationship between R5, X5, and Resonant Frequency to the 1s forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in pregnant women. Methods: In 42 asthmatic pregnant patients aged 18Y41 yr (mean 28.5 yr) spirometry and impulse oscillometry (Erich Jaeger, Germany) was performed according to standard guidelines and manufacturers instructions. Relationships between spirometric indices and total Resistance (R5), central resistance (R20), peripheral reactance (X5) and Resonance Frequency (FRes) were obtained using correlation and regression analysis. Volumes are expressed in litres and resistance in kpa.1.s. Results: Mean T SD of FEV1 was 2.32T0.46, FVC was 2.93T0.64 , FEV1/ FVC was 80.90T15.81 , R5 was 0.49T0.14 , X5 was j0.11T0.14 and FRes was 19.71T5.00. There was significant (pG0.001) correltion between the R5 and FRes, each with FEV1.R5: FEV1 = 3.14 Y 1.34 R5, R 2 = 0.21FRes: FEV1 = 3.90 Y 3.24 fres, R 2 =0.22. Conclusion: These results suggest that Impulse Oscillometry is a valuable tool to assess airway obstruction as it is simple and requires minimal subject cooperation. This new field of oscillometry application may be particularly useful in patients who are unable to perform spirometry.

College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Department of Pediatrics, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Rationale: Asthma is a Th2 cell mediated chronic inflammatory airway disease. Bronchoscopic biopsy is the best method to evaluate airway inflammation but it is too invasive for children. Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a relatively simple, noninvasive, and very reproducible test for detection of endogenous inflammatory signals in childhood. Recently measurement of FeNO level is emerging as a non-invasive tool for airway inflammation. The aim of our study was to determine the relationship between FeNO and acute asthmatic exacerbation, and to decide whether measurement of FeNO could predict acute asthma exacerbation. Methods: Thirty eight children with mild to moderate persistent asthma aged from 3 to 15 years who presented to Kyunghee Medical Center were studied. FeNO levels were measured by chemiluminescence during exhalation into the NO analyzer. Patient's data were based on out-patient records. We compared FeNO levels between exacerbation group and non-exacerbation group. Results: The mean FeNO level in the asthmatic children was 16.7T13.9 ppb. In the range of abnormal FeNO level (Q10 ppb), there was significant difference between asthma exacerbation group and non-exacerbation group (p=0.004). There was also significant correlation between FeNO level and acute asthma exacerbation (p=0.003). Conclusion: Exhaled nitric oxide levels were related with acute asthmatic exacerbation in childhood asthma. Thus measurement of FeNO can be a promising clinical tool for predicting asthma exacerbation in mild to moderate persistent asthmatic children.",

Background of the study: The main pathogenic mechanism of bronchial asthma is chronic eosinophil-based inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), is known to be a major risk factor for the development of asthma and to be equivalent of asthma severity. Methods: Main aim of this project, supported by IGA MZ CR No. NR8383-3/ 2005 , is to test if the level of AHR is associated with certain alleles or haplotypes of genes (ADAM 33 and STAT 6) involved in immune system activity in course of allergic illness development and airway hyperresponsiveness. 80 children with bronchial asthma had histamine and methacholine brochnoprovocation tests in a sequence with increasing levels using dosimetric method and MedicAid and DeVilbiss nebulizers. Oscilometric assessment I was followed by baseline spirometry, and with oscillometric assessment II after a decrease in FEV19 20% versus baseline. Examinations of responsible polymorphisms of ADAM 33 and STAT 6 genes were accomplished by sequence analysis in 80 children with asthma bronchiale, their sibs and parents and 50 control healthy children. Results: Examinations of responsible polymorphisms of ADAM 33 and STAT 6 genes were accomplished by sequence analysis in 80 children with asthma bronchiale, their sibs and parents and 50 control healthy children. In the evaluation of the result it could be demonstrated that changes in resistance R5 and R20 between oscillometric assessments I and II more than 40% are consistent with a decrease in FEV1 more than 20% in both dosimetric method. The statistical evaluation of the association of genes polymorphisms with asthma bronchiale occurrence and airway hyperresponsiveness level in children will be presented by poster. Conclusion: These results show that resistance R5 over R20, as measured with IOS (impulse oscillometry), significantly correlates with the-gold standard-FEV1. Description of influence of particular sequence changes could contribute to additional insight to the airway hyperresponsiveness genetical background.",

Kharkov Allergological Center, Allergology, Kharkov, Ukraine. Background: The majority of asthmatic patients achieve control of their illness, but not all. It is therefore crucial to develop strategies that help the clinician monitor the disease, improving the response to treatment. Methods: We have quantified the inflammation in central and peripheral airways by measuring exhaled nitric oxide (NO) at multiple exhalation flows in 42 asthmatic patients at different levels of severity (mild = 11; moderate stable = 10; moderate during exacerbation = 9; severe = 12, 6 of whom were receiving oral corticosteroids) and 15 healthy control subjects. Results: Bronchial NO (bNO) in patients with mild asthma (2,283+/j346 pL/s) [mean+/jSD] was higher than in patients with moderate stable asthma (1,317+/j61 pL/s, pG 0.001), in patients with severe asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) [1,023+/j72 pL/s, pG 0.001], and healthy control subjects (697+/j31 pL/s, pG 0.001). There were no differences between bNO in patients with mild asthma compared to patients with severe asthma receiving ICS and oral corticosteroids (2,335+/j269 pL/s). Patients with exacerbations showed a higher bNO (3,521+/j373.2 pL/s, pG 0.01) compared to the other groups. Alveolar NO was higher in patients with severe asthma receiving oral corticosteroids (3.1+/j0.2 parts per billion [ppb], pG 0.0001) than in the other groups but was not significantly higher than in patients with moderate asthma during exacerbation (2.7+/j0.4 ppb) . No differences were seen in NO diffusion levels between the different asthma groups. All the measurements were highly reproducible and free of day-to-day and diurnal variations. Conclusion: Differential flow analysis of exhaled NO provides additional information about the site of inflammation in asthma and may be useful in assessing the response of peripheral inflammation to using therapy.",

National University Singapore, Department of Pediatrics, Singapore, Singapore. Introduction: Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and in Singapore over 25% of children have ever been diagnosed with asthma by age 15. Most children are seen in the primary care setting, thus it is of value to study the management practices of general practitioners and pediatricians in comparison with gold standards. The aims of the study were to investigate: a) methods of monitoring of childhood asthma, b) practices in managing acute asthma exacerbations, and c) choice of therapy in maintenance treatment. Methods: 2100 questionnaires of 35 questions were sent by post to general practitioners and pediatricians throughout Singapore. 173 valid responses were received and results were compared to 2006 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. Results: Of respondents 76.3% were general practitioners. For monitoring childhood asthma, most physicians (89.1%) did not use symptom score cards/ diaries, while 37.6% did not use peak-flow meters/spirometry. For acute treatment, 83.8% used a short-acting \u00e2-agonist, but only 41.0% used oral corticosteroids in outpatients. In the maintenance treatment of asthma, across all age-groups (infants, preschoolers, and older children) the most commonly used first line drug was uniformly an inhaled corticosteroid. However, combinations of long acting beta-agonists (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids were uniformly the second most popular maintenance treatment. Maintenance treatment was frequently used by most doctors in treating preschoolers (62.4%) and older children (64.7%). In contrast, most doctors seldom (45.1%) or never (21.4%) applied maintenance treatment to infants. The vast majority (158; 91.3%) of doctors never used immunotherapy in asthma management, and 2.9% of respondents believed immunotherapy was not available locally. Conclusion: Greater usage of diaries/score cards can be encouraged along with objective peak flow/spirometry measurements. Management of acute exacerbations is appropriate, but corticosteroids are under-prescribed by most doctors. LABA continues to be prescribed for maintenance despite a lack of established safety profile for infants, along with recommendations that they only be used selectively in patients that are poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids. Immunotherapy is not widely used and more awareness/ instruction should be generated among doctors.",

Methods: HBsAg seropositive patients using ICS were reviewed retrospectively from Jan 1997 to Mar 2007. We reviewed data of 183 patients who met our inclusion and exclusion criteria including dose and duration of ICS and SC treatment, HBV DNA titer, HBeAg/Ab and AST/ALT serum level, and usage of antiviral drugs such as lamivudine. Results: Among the 183 patients who were using ICS, 66 patients were treated with SC at least on one event. HBV reactivation occured in 5 out of 66 (7.6%) subjects who have ever used SC and 2 out of 117 (1.7%) subjects under ICS treatment alone. Among the 5 subjects with HBV reactivation who have ever used SC, 4 (80%) subjects were treated with SC chronically due to difficult-tocontrol asthma with more than 9000mg of total cumulative dose of prednisolone. 2 subjects with HBV reaction who were using only ICS were using moderate dose ICS. Conclusion: Chronic use of SC and high total cumulative dose of SC are risk factors of HBV reactivation in patients with asthma and COPD. ICS treatment alone is not a risk factor of HBV reactivation. Prophylactic antiviral therapy should be considered in patients who needs chronic or high dose SC treatment. Background: The prevalence of asthma is increasing in the last years. Also gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is increasing in the last years. It is known that gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) may be present and also may aggravate asthma.

Methods: To determine whether patients with fixed airflow obstruction have distinct cellular and biochemical characteristics depending on their asthmatic features, we characterized 30 consecutive outpatients presenting with fixed airflow obstruction by bronchodilator response, peak expiratory flow variability, serum total immunoglobulin E, allergen skin prick test, methacholine bronchial challenge test (MCT), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In addition, to determine significance of MCT on differentiating asthma from COPD, we exam MCT on 111 outpatients divided to asthma, pure COPD, and control group. Results: We found that subtypes of T lymphocytes did not show significant difference in number and ratio on both groups, but neutrophils in BAL fluid was significantly lower in group with asthmatic features. Additionally, their cytokine analysis showed significantly higher level of IL-4 in asthmatic patient compared with COPD patients, while lower level of IL-5 and INF-gamma in asthma group compared with COPD group. In MCT results, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of sensitivity and specificity has shown that best cut-off value of PC 20 is 15.4 mg/ml in classifying the asthma and pure COPD. Conclusion: We conclude that despite of similar fixed airflow obstruction, subjects with asthmatic features have distinct cellular and biochemical characteristics compared with pure COPD. In addition, we suggest that the MCT using the new cut-off value could be a more useful diagnostic tool for distinguishing asthma from pure COPD. Based on these findings, we expect that this distinction of asthma from pure COPD using the different pathophysiologic manifestations could provide more proper and specific therapeutic management for the patients.",

National Hospital Organization, Sagamihara National Hospital, Clinical Research Center for Allergy and Rheumatol, Kanagawa, Japan. Background: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp.f) induced by IgE and IgG antibodies which progress to central bronchiectasis (CBE) even at an early stage. We hypothesized that the airway remodeling (=irreversible change of bronchial wall) in patients with ABPA is accompanied by not only CBE but also persistent bronchial narrowing at an early stage of ABPA. Methods: We evaluated bronchial reversibility (BR) using salbutamol and airway hyperresposiveness (AHR) using acetylcholine (Ach) in ABPA patients with CBE (=classical ABPA) and without CBE (=seropositive ABPA), and compared the BR and AHR of these patients with those of patients with allergic fungal asthma without the IgG antibody to Asp.f. Nineteen classical ABPA, 11 seropositive ABPA, and 21 allergic fungal asthmatics were participated in this study. Results: All the subjects were positive for the IgE antibody to Asp.f. All the ABPA patients with or without CBE were positive for the IgG antibody to Asp.f. In all classical ABPA patients, but not in seropositive ABPA patients, typical CBE findings were detected in HRCT. There were no differences in age, total IgE level (RIST), and %FEV1 among the three groups. However, not only classical ABPA patients, but also seropositive ABPA patients showed significantly attenuated BR after salbutamol inhalation (median increase in FEV1: 170, 210, 340 ml, pG0.05) . Moreover, about one-half of ABPA patients showed normal or very mild AHR, on the other hand, none of the allergic fungal asthmatics showed normal AHR. Conclusion: These results suggest that ABPA patients, even at an early stage, may show irreversible bronchial narrowing resistant to bronchodilators or bronchostimulator inhalation.",

Background: Atypical presentations of asthma and abnormal imaging are factors that prompt the pursuit of a lung tissue diagnosis. We present a case of follicular bronchiolitis (FB) in a patient thought to have severe asthma. Methods: A 35 year old male non-smoker developed productive cough, dyspnea and wheezing for 2 years. He was treated with inhaled steroids, long acting beta-agonists, montelukast, antibiotics and prednisone for late onset asthma. Symptoms worsened with oral steroid taper. Results: Pulmonary function tests revealed severe obstruction (FEV1 36%, FEV1/FVC of 86%) with significant bronchodilator response (30%) and mildly decreased diffusion capacity (68% predicted). Skin tests were positive to dust mite, mold, cats and dogs. Immunological evaluation ( : 1,3,8,9,14,26,51,56) .

It may be idiopathic or associated with hypersensitivity phenomenon or collagen vascular disease. A few cases are reported associated with immunodeficiency such as HIV or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Initially, he was thought to have an immune deficiency but repeat analysis revealed normal immunologic function. His disease may, therefore, be idiopathic or related to a hypersensitivity reaction not well understood. He is controlled with steroids and azithromycin. Results: During study period, 1106 nasopharyngeal aspirates were examined from hospitalized children with respiratory symptom, of these, viruses were detected in 785(70.9%). From this population, 58 had hospitalization due to acute asthma exacerbations. Of these, infectious agents were detected in 38(65.5%) of the patients. RSV was detected in 18(31%), IFV in 10(17.2%), RV in 7(12.1%), CoV in 5(8.6%), AdV in 4(6.9%), PIV in 5(8.6%), HMPV in 2 (3.4%) . Coinfection was identified in 12(20.7%) of the samples. Exacerbation of asthma symptoms was greatest in winter(38%). The highest number of samples positive for respiratory syncytial virus was recorded in January(59%). Conclusion: In conclusion, we confirmed that acute exacerbations of asthma necessitating hospitalization was often associated with respiratory viral infection, especially RSV in young children. Also, there were no significant differences between young children and school-aged children in the prevalence of respiratory virus. We found that the causative virus in hospitalized children with asthma exacerbations follow the epidemics of respiratory virus in hospitalized children with respiratory infection. Introduction: It has been suggested that chronic chlamydia pneumoniae infection could be a cause for adult onset of asthma. There are data to suggest that infectious organisms, particulary the atypical bacteria, Clamydia pneumoniae, may be involved in asthma pathogenesis. It is not known whether this organism was allowed to persist after an infection, or was present prior to the development of asthma. The significance of atypical bacteria in the exacerbation of asthma is stil unclear.",

All patients had chlamydia pneumoniae infection detected by specific IgA=1:40 and specific IgG= 1:256 against Chlamydia pneumoniae. Post treatment lung function and symptom score (caugh, wheezing, dyspnea) were compared with baseline values. Results: After 6 weeks of treatment with azithromycin there was significant reduction in symptom score (pG0,01) and significant improvement in lung function FEV1 (pG0,01), Wilcoxon matched Pairs test. Conclusion: Treatment with azithromycin significantly improved asthma symptoms and lung function indicating that Chlamydia pneumoniae may play an important role in enhancing the inflammatory processes in lower airways.

Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are rare but well-known complications of acute asthma. The generally accepted explanation for the development of pneumomedistinumis that free air tracks from ruptured alveoli along peribronchial vascular sheaths toward the hilum of the lung. From there, it extends proximally within the mediastinum. Atelectasis of the lungs is due to the formation of mucous plugs and usually responds well to the treatment of the underlying disease. This is a csse report of a 47-year old female patient L.D., who developed pneumomedistinum and atelectasis in the course of a severe asthma exacerbation. The patient has a 27-year long history of asthma and in 2004 she was vitally endangered and mechanically ventilated. In the course of this exacerbation, she developed progressive dyspnea, cough and fever. During acute coughing, an edema and crackles developed in the face, neck and chest regions, accompanied by a sudden deterioration of dyspnea, tachypnea and cyanosis. The arterial blood gas analysis at rest revealed a severe manifested partial respiratory insufficiency, and the chest X-ray established subacute emphysema. As no satisfactory regression of the disease was achieved, the chest CT scanning was performed on the eighth day, revealing atelectasis of the posterobasal left lung segment.

Conclusion: Inhibition synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines is an important link in the prevention of respiratory complications during surgery in patients with asthma. The applying of IL-13 and interferon gamma may be a perspective in this view.",

Background: Cough is a reflex response of the lower respiratory tract to stimulation of irritant or cough receptors in the airways mucosa. The most common cause in children is reactive airways(asthma). Specific lower respiratory stimuli include excessive secretions, aspirated foreign material, inhaled dust particles or noxious gases,and a inflammatory response to infectios agents or allergic processes. Useful information that may aid in distinguishing the cough origin may include a history or family history of atopic conditions (asthma, eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis) a seasonal or environmental variation in frequency or intensity of cough. Case Report: We presented 3-members of a family with chronic cough (more than 6-weeks duration) which started after an upper respiratory tract infection and coninued in spite of antibiotic and bronchodilator therapy, In their past history there was not any atopic condition, The young son had difficult breathing especially in their house and got better outside, In allergy clinic we couldn t find wheezy breathing in rest and also after activity in their son, and PFC tests were in normal limits for parents, (the 4-year-old boy was incooperative) In the next step (and second visit) when they admitted in emergency ward we could find a problem in their house, they had been using a wall heater and its airway has been closed by a bird nest. They were exposed to noxious gases for a long time.",

Introduction: Recent studies have proposed a decline in tuberculosis infection is a factor underlying the rising severity and prevalence of atopic disorders in developed countries. There are also conflicting reports on the effect of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination on the subsequent development of atopy and asthma. BCG as the most potent inducer of TH1 is believed to suppress TH2 dependent atopic reaction. Methods: Trying to prove this hypothesis, in a case-control simple sampled 100 patients younger than 5 years old who were known case of asthma with variable severity received 5 units intradermal tuberculin test. The patients were also BCG-vaccined at birth. As the control group 100 healthy children previously vaccined at birth, who were age-adjusted with case group, were also test with tuberculin test (PPD). After 48 hours, induction area was measured in two vertical and longitudinal diameters. At the same time, the severity of asthma in the case group was determined (according to classification of National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Heart, lung and blood), by asking mothers about the frequencies of night and day symptoms or intervals of attacks. The patients were divided to three groups: Mild, Moderate and severe groups (mild intermittent and mild persistent groups were classified as one group). Results: In our case group, mean size of PPD skin test response was 1.7mmT2.99mm but in the control group mean size was 4.42mmT3.69mm( pG0.0001) . Also in another test we divided our case group to two groups ; PPD skin test less than 5mm and more than 5 mm; again with a significant P value. Conclusion: As a conclusion, patients with definite asthma had a significant weaker response to PPD test. This is indicator of weaker TH1 response in allergic patients, can be proposed that stimulation of TH1-immune system by BCG vaccination at birth can influence subsequent development of allergic diseases dominantly mediated with TH2-Immune system. This may promise a revolution in the future of asthma. Regarding the severity of asthma, no significant evidence supported the relation between severity of asthma and PPD skin test response, it may be explained by dominancy of moderate asthma group.",

Kharkov Allergological Centre, Allergology, Kharkov, Ukraine. Background: Several reports have suggested a possible link between bronchial asthma and coronary spasm, but the possibility of a relationship in coronary spastic angina (CSA) has not been clarified. Methods: Airway responsiveness to methacholine and coronary spasticity to acetylcholine were examined in 39 patients with CSA and 28 patients with chest pain syndrome (CPS). Sixteen healthy subjects as the control group were enrolled in the study and their airway responsiveness compared with that of the CSA and CPS patients. Results: The incidence of airway hyperresponsiveness was significantly higher in the CSA group (71%) than in the CPS (21%) and control (16%) groups (pG0.001). The geometric mean of the log minimum dose (Dmin), defined as the cumulative dose at the point at which respiratory conductance began to decrease, was significantly lower in the CSA group (0.73 log units) than in the CP (1.18 log units) and control (1.41 log units) groups (pG0.01). Conclusion: Results of this study demonstrate that acetylcholine-induced coronary spasticity is significantly related to methacholine-induced airway responsiveness in patients with coronary spastic angina. A generalized hyperresponsiveness of the vascular and nonvascular smooth muscles, including that through cholinergic mechanisms, may exist in patients with coronary spastic angina.",

Results: Reflux disease symptoms was recorded in eighteen patients of the studied group (62%). GERD was diagnosed, based on esophogial 24 h PH monitoring, in only 11 patients of those who expressing symptoms of GERD. Mean of Anxiety score was higher among symptomatic group than non symptomatic reflecting the attribution of differnt symptoms of anxiety to the GERD syndrom. Conclusion: Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have a high prevalence of symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. However True GERD was documented in a fewer number of them.

Background: Most patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma present in advanced stages of disease. Response rates and survival with currently available therapies are poor. Therefore, it is critical to identify the molecular markers of mesothelioma which would provide a way of understanding this neoplasm and targeting these markers in therapy. Objectives: To assess the immunoreactivity of c-Met in malignant pleural mesothelioma and to analyze the potential link of the c-MET expression to some clincopathological parameters such as tumor subtype, TNM stage and patients' survival. Methods: A total of 20 patients (7 females and 13 males) with pathologically confirmed MPM; age range, (35 to 63 years) were included in the study. The patient records for the clinical, radiological and laboratory investigations and the results of closed pleura biopsies were analyzed. Pleura biopsies were stained for c-Met using immunohistochemical technique applied to paraffin sections. Results: Of the studied tumors 18 (90%) were immunoreactive for c-Met. There were no significant relations between c-Met and patient age (p=0.569) or gender (0.755). Also there was no relation between c-Met expression and clinical symptoms. All tumors that showed distant metastasis were c-Met positive. While all c-Met negative tumors showed no metastasis. However, the difference was statistically insignificant. There was also no relation between c-Met and tumor subtype (p=0.40) or tumor stage (p=0.257). However, all T3 and T4 tumors were c-Met positive and the two c-Met negative tumors were of T2. The 2 c-Met negative patients showed one-year survival. Whereas (7/18) of patients with positive c-Met died. However, again the difference was statistically insignificant (p=0.755). Background: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a prevalent condition in adults associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. Circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a pro-inflammatory protein, are associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis.Therefore, CRP may be one of the links between OSAH and cardiovascular disease (CVD).We hypothesized that Patients with OSA have higher CRP values than do control subjects. Methods and Results: We studied 28 patients (20 males and 8 females ) with newly diagnosed (OSA), who were free of other diseases, had never been treated for OSA, and were taking no medications. After polysomnography, venous blood was collected at 5 AM and serum levels of CRP were investigated. We compared CRP measurements in these patients to measurements obtained in 20 control subjects (14 males and 6 females ) who were matched for age and body mass index, and in whom occult OSA was excluded. Levels of CRP were significantly higher in patients with OSAS than in obese control subjects (CRP PG0.000). We evaluated relationship between the Levels of CRP and sleep study parameters such as Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI), Desaturation Index(DI), Average of Mean Saturation ,Average of Lowest Saturation (LSAT) and Percentage of Sleep Time with Saturation less than 90 %. The results showed significant statistical positive correlations between CRP values and AHI (pG 0.00), DI (pG 0.00) and percentage of sleep time with saturation less than 90 % (pG 0.00) in the OSAS patients. Conclusion: Levels of CRP are elevated in patients with OSAS. Therefore, OSAS is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The severity of OSA is proportional to the CRP level.",

Methods: Since 1995, AEP or CEP have been diagnosed in 21 patients (pts). Clinical examination, radiograph, CT or HRCT scan, laboratory examinations with peripheral blood count of eosinophils (Eo), microbiology, mycobacteriology, fiberbronchoscopy or histology were used. The pts were divided into two groups: AEP and CEP. The ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: 13 female, median age 66 yrs (36Y87) and 8 male, median 67 yrs (55Y85) had one of the two forms: AEP in 7 pts and CEP in 14 pts. The main clinical symptoms were dyspnoe in 20 pts (95.2%), cough in 19 pts (90.5%), fever in 17 pts (80.9%), pain in 5 pts (23.8%). AEP or CEP was the result of concomitant disease in 3 pts with toxoplasmosis and in 1 pt. with sarcoidosis, rhinitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. In 15 pts no concomitant disease was identified. A statistical significance was found between the age of pts with AEP (56T12.2) and CEP (67.8T12.9) (pG0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the absolute Eo count in male (614.8T279.3) and female (709.3T811.3) and in the groups of AEP (860.7T976.7) and CEP (579.6T429.3). 9 pts have been continually treated with corticosteroids, 8 pts temporarily and 4 pts have not received any treatment. The longest treated patient has been receiving corticosteroid for more than 9 yrs. Conclusion: EP is a very interesting disease. The clinical symptoms are similar to typical pneumonia, but treatment with antibiotics is unsuccessful. The treatment with steroids is determined on an individual basis. Dividing AEP and CEP is not so clear cut. We could consider using the results of corticosteroids treatment as a way dividing AEP and CEP since the treatment in AEP is only temporary and in CEP on-going. Recent studies have shown that osteoporosis and vertebral fractures are quite common in postmenopausal women with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Few data are available in correlation between bone mass density (BMD) and men with COPD.This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of osteoporosis in men with COPD. with special regards to the role of glucocorticoids (GCs) use in these patients. We aimed to determine factors that influencing bone metabolism and the clinical variables of this group of patients. We also tried to answer the arising question: should COPD patients be routinely evaluated for BMD? Methods: The study included 56 male patients with documented COPD for at least two years, their age ranged 24-66 years. Subjects were divided into 3 groups: group 1. consisted of 18 patients, who were oral GCs users, group 2. consisted of 18 patients who were inhaled GCs users and group 3. consisted of 20 patients, never GCs users (this group was considered as the control group). All subjects underwent measurement of BMD. pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and a number of biochemical markers of bone metabolism. The associations between BMD. PFTs. GCs use. biochemical markers and clinical variables were analyzed. Results: Of all 56 patients with COPD. the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. as defined by WHO criteria was 26.8% and 21.4% at the lumber spine. 30.4% and 23.2% at total hip. 35.7% and 28.5% at femoral neck and 32.1% and 28.8% for total body respectively. Patients included group 1 had the lowest BMD at any site (pG0.0001). group 2 patients had over all bone mass loss, that was indistinguishable from those who were received oral GCs. group 3 patients had less bone mass reduction than the other two groups. Of the clinical and biochemical markers measured. N-telopeptide was significantly correlated with bone mass (PG0.01), but there was no correlation with other markers. The lowest mean of FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second) was observed in group 1 patients. BMI (Body Mass Index) was weakly correlated with bone mass in the 3 studied groups. Conclusion: Bone mass loss is a common problem in male patients with COPD. while the use of oral GCs increase the frequency of osteoporosis, inhaled GCs therapy offered no protection from bone loss. COPD patients who had never treated with GCs had also a substantial risk for osteoporosis. We advocate early screening and preventive intervention.",

Patients completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), 1 day before and 1 weeks after therapy. FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), blood gas tensions and 6 min walking distance (6MWD) were measured. 10 control patients attended weekly for lung function and 6MWD for 6 weeks, but had no psychotherapy. There were no differences in mean baseline (BAI) score, lung function, blood gas tensions or 6MWD between groups. After treatment, the BAI score had decreased from 43.10 to 20.6 (pG0.001), in association, the mean 6MWD had also improved in the psychotherapy group only, from 333 to 559 m (pG0.001), an increase of 75%. In conclusion, six sessions of cognitive and behavioural psychotherapy produced a good improvement in exercise tolerance in anxious patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Pink puffer).",

Analysis of various biomarkers in exhaled breath allows completely safe, noninvasive, sensitive, and specific tool for the primary screening for different lung diseases. The aim of this study was to test whether exhaled breath analyzed with artificial nose could identify and discriminate between asthma, COPD, lung cancer and pneumonia. Methods: Exhaled air was collected in plastic bags and immediately analyzed by electronic nose instrument (9185, Nordic Sensors AB) containing 14 different odour sensors. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis and support vector machine was used to find relationships between the sensor response, on derivative, on integral and the clinical diagnoses of patients. Results: 62 individuals Y 25 asthma, 13 lung cancer, 13 pneumonia, 12 other lung disease patients and 10 healthy volunteers were tested. Given table represents p values of significant relationship between electronic nose sensors and clinical diagnosis. Some sensors (1, 6, and 13) gave specific responses to particular disease; some other sensors (3, 5, and 7) shared the response with two diseases. The highest sensitivity and specificity was found for lung cancer diagnosis compared to healthy control group It was 100% and 92,9% respectively.",

Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Allergy and Immunology, Delhi, India. Background: Cockroach allergen sensitization has been implicated as a major cause of allergy/asthma. Recently we have demonstrated a serine protease (Per a 10) as an immunodominant allergen from Periplaneta americana (American cockroach). So, we aimed to investigate the immune-inflammatory responses to active serine protease in mice model of airway inflammation. Methods: Balb/c mice were sensitized with proteolytically active allergen or OVA through intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes and challenged intranasally with Per a 10 allergen (active / inactive), PBS or OVA. The cellular infiltration (total cell count and EPO activity in BALF), Th1/Th2 cytokines in BALF and spleen culture supernatant, serologic (specific IgE, IgG1) and histopathologic events in the various animal groups were compared. Results: Mice challenged with active serine protease allergen or OVA showed tissue damage in the lungs, elevated serum IgE, IgG1, eosinophils and expression of inflammatory cytokines in BALF and spleen culture supernatant, indicating the induction of a Th2 response. Administration of proteolytically inactive allergen (blocked irreversibly with AEBSF) induced significantly lower levels of cellular infiltration in lungs, systemic IgE production and Th2 cytokines. Quantitative evaluation of lung tissues showed decrease in total inflammation score in mice challenged with inactive protease. Conclusion: Serine protease allergen from P. americana induces allergic response in a mice model and its proteolytic activity enhances the airway inflammation. The inactivated allergen may have potential for therapeutic applications.",

Background: It is well known that allergy in India and other countries appear to be one of the commonest major health problems. Cassia siamea Lam. of the family Fabaceae is an important avenue tree in tropics. Its pollen grain has been known as one of the important pollinosis causing airborne bioparticles. The present study was demonstrated to identify its important allergenic components and also to study the cross reactivity between the members of the family Fabaceae. Methods: The seasonal periodicities of airborne Cassia pollen were recorded in a 2-year aerobiological survey using a seven-day Burkard volumetric sampler (Burkard manufacturing Co., Rickmansworth, Herts, England). The allergising potential of Cassia pollen antigen was investigated by in vivo skin prick tests and in vitro IgE-enzyme linked immuno sorbant assay (ELISA). The IgE specific immunoblotting confirm the IgE sensitive reaction between the pollen allergen and patient`s sera. In the present study, the whole pollen extract of C. siamea pollen was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The presence of glycoprotein in the crude allergenic extracts of Cassia siamea pollen was detected by PAS (Periodic Acid Schif) technique. Results: An intensely positive result (+++) was observed in response to SPT with the antigenic extract of C. siamea pollen. Within 175 patients 30.85 % shows positive allergic reactions. Immunochemical studies revealed the presence of ten allergenic components in the molecular weight ranging between 8Y83 KDA. Three major allergenic protein bands (22, 17, 9 KDA) were isolated by IgE-specific immunoblotting with individual sensitive patients sera. Background: Mite allergy is a disease induced by inhalation of mite bodies and feces present in the house dust, leading to asthma, nasal inflammation, and dermatitis. The identification of allergens is needed for the specific immunotherapy. Our allergenomic analysis of Dermatophagoides farinae body extract by two-dimensional immunoblotting followed by mass spectrometry has revealed a number of new allergens. The purpose of this study is to characterize a 15-kD allergen, DFA22, with high frequency and intensity of patients' IgE binding.",

Analysis of its deduced amino acid sequence and predicted molecular conformation suggested that DFA22 is a new member of group 2 mite allergens (ML protein). It was noted that DFA22 has a higher homology with a sheep scab mite allergen, Pso o 2 (62% identity in amino acid sequences), and a storage mite allergen, Lep d 2 (46%), than a house dust mite allergen, Der f 2 (40%), indicating that there are at least two subgroups in the group 2 mite allergens. In order to characterize the immunochemical profile of the new allergen, a recombinant protein was produced using a vector pCold-TF, which can express trigger factor (TF) fusion protein at low-temperature, and Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami, which has an ability to form precise disulfide-bond. The rDFA22 was purified by His-tag affinity chromatography, removal of TF, and anion exchange chromatography. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that three disulfide-bonds characteristic to the group 2 mite allergens are formed in the rDFA22. ELISA indicated that its IgE binding frequency was 51% (n = 35; RAST scores to mite 9 3). The binding of patients' IgE to rDFA22 was partially inhibited by rDer f 2 (~32% inhibition) and Pso o 2 (~56%), implying that these allergens shear common IgE epitope(s). Conclusion: DFA22 is an important novel allergen that cannot be disregarded to achieve successful specific immunotherapy against mite allergy. It is also necessary to reconsider the molecular differentiation of the group 2 mite allergens.",

Methods: Inhalant allergen skin prick test (SPT) were done in 527 asthma and 620 allergic rhinitis children respectively. The positive rates of different allergen and allergen spectrum in asthma and allergic rhinitis were analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference on the positive rates of SPT in asthma and allergic rhinitis (77.8% vs78.9%, P 9 0.05). The main inhalant allergens related to asthma and allergic rhinitis were Dermatophagoids pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoids farinae ,alternaria, cat dander and mugwort. The positive rates of Der.p, Der.f and molds mixture in asthma were higher than those in allergic rhinitis (64.6% vs 49.5%, 59.8% vs 47.9%, 8.8% vs 3.9%, P G 0.05); The positive rates of summer-autumn pollen and mugwort in allergic rhinitis were higher than those in asthma (25.6% vs 19.3%, 26.0% vs 19.3%, P G 0.05). 40.2% asthmatics and 46.2% allergic rhinitis children were single allergen sensitization.

Conclusion: Mites, molds, pets and summer-autumn pollen were the main inhalant allergens related to asthma and allergic rhinitis children with 3~14 years of age. The allergen spectrums were similar in asthma and allergic rhinitis. Mites and molds allergy were more popular in asthma while summerautumn pollen in allergic rhinitis. Background: Sensitization to food and airborne environmental allergens data is still rare reported. This study evaluated the epidermal skinprick test prevalence and types of pollen causing allergic symptoms have not been still well defined. Methods: We selected consecutive patients with respiratory symptoms sugestives of allergic respiratory pathologies.

The results corresponding to the period 2004Y2006, obtained following the counting method of the Spanish Aerobiology Network (Red Espa\u00f1ola de Aerobiolog\u00eda, REA), are presented. Results: The most abundant pollen types have been (by decreasing order of the annual indexes): Urticaceae, Asteraceae (99% Artemisia), Arecaceae, Myrica, Poaceae, Ericaceae, Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae, Olea, Cupressaceae, Polygonaceae, Pinus, Moraceae, Plantago Mercurialis, Myrtaceae, and 43 other pollen types (G1% of the pollen spectrum). Herbs predominate in the pollen spectrum (60%) during the first half of the year. Trees (34%) predominate during the summer time. Finally shrubs (5%) pollinate mostly in spring. Most of the cited pollen types are able to cause allergy. Prevalence of pollen allergy during the period 2004Y2006 was 16% of patients with respiratory allergy studied in our medical center. The most frecuent types of pollen sensitization were: Artemisia vulgaris (64,5%), Poaceae family (Gramineae) (45,2%), Parietaria judaica (24,6%), Chenopodium album (9,4%) , Salsola kali (6,2%) y Plantago lanceolata (4%) . The prevalence of sensitized patients to molds were less than 5%. Conclusion: Pollen is a relevant cause of allergic respiratory diseases in our area.

Hesamedin Nabavizadeh 1 , and Sohila Al-yasin 2 . 1 Yasuj University of Medicine, Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Yasuj, Islamic Republic of Iran; 2 Shiraz University of Medicine, Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran. Objective: Allergic rhinitis is the single most common chronic allergic disease worldwide. House dust mites, grass pollens and fungal spores play has been identified to play a major role in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis. To determine the distribution of allergens among allergic rhinitis patients living in the shiraz region. Methods: We investigated 56 allergic rhinitis patients (29 females, 27 males; mean age 22.3+/j14.1 years) who had symptoms. Results: The history and clinical examination revealed that 14 patients (25%) had seasonal symptoms and 42 patients (75%) had perennial symptoms. Common pattern of multiple allergens were tree mixture allergens (58.9%), grass mixture (42.8%), mite (19.6%), candida (10.7%), tomato (5.3%), fruite (3.5%), and feather mixture (3.5%) and cladosporium, oak, ash (3.5%), alternaria, maple, hen egg, aspergillus (1.7%). Skin prick test were negative in 12 cases (21.4%). According to the prick test results, sensitivity to one allergen was found in 5 patients (8.9%) and sensitivity to multiple allergens in 51 patients. Family history were positive in 29 patients. Conclusion: The most common allergens were tree mixture and grass in the shiraz region. It was concluded that the distribution of allergens was associated with the climatic, environmental and socioeconomic features of the region. Larger representative sample involving multi-centers in Shiraz should be encouraged in the near future.",

On the other hand, Malatya is exporting the 20% of the world's apricot consumption. I am working on a detailed crosssensitisation research between TA and apricot tree pollen. Since, there is no apricot tree pollen extract produced by any company, I gathered this pollen in a powder form and made connection with companies to produce the antigen to use in aeroallergen skin prick tests. Islamabad is one of the most beautiful capitals of the world with mountains and greenery all arround. But it has also highest pollen counts in asia with huge number of with Pollen allergy patients. In spring and fall numerous patients visit emergency department of different hospitals. Rapeseed mustard is the second most important edible oil in India.

Background: Aerosolized pollen are an important cause of respiratory allergy worldwide. The availability of pollen counts in westernized countries is essential for patient education and medical treatment. Aerobiological pollen data is scarce in the Middle East and had never been previously assessed in Lebanon. In order to identify and quantify pollen prevalence in Lebanon, a national aerobiology program was launched starting in the capital city of Beirut. Methods: A Lanzoni pollen trap was placed on a roof top in Beirut 20 meters above ground level. A seven-day cycle drum with a 168-hour film coated with silicon adhesive was used to capture pollen grains. Slides were stained with gelatin fuschin & examined with a light microscope using a 40x objective. Pollen identification and counting was recorded on a weekly basis. Results: A total of 9491 pollen grains/m3 were collected for the 12 month period of 2006 (except for a brief interruption during the 2006 summer military conflict). Twelve different types of pollen were identified which were Alnus, Cupressaceae, Oleaceae, Pinaceae, Juglandaceae, Mercurialis, Chenopodiaceae, Artemesia, Parietaria, Plantago, Apiaceae, and Poaceae (table 1). The 4 most common pollen found over the study period was Oleaceae (27% of total) followed by Cupressaceae (24%), Pinaceae (18% of total), and Mercurialis (17%) (table 2). The peak pollen level recorded was 327 pollen grains/m3 on April 17th with an average daily count of 93 pollen grains/m3 throughout the month of April. The lowest total pollen count was in the month of September with an average daily level of G2 pollen/m3/day. Conclusion: This was the first aerobiologic pollen data ever recorded in the country of Lebanon. Typical elevation of pollen counts in the spring was observed however the level was surprisingly high for an urban area. The finding of tree pollen (cupressaceae and Alnus) in winter months along with identification of a particular pollen (Mercurialis) not previously suspected were important findings for this allergen information-poor country. Since pollen collection took place in only one location (Central Beirut) and for only one year, extrapolation to a nationwide impression can not be made. Nonetheless the exciting pollen data generated in 2006, a first for Lebanon, will serve a pioneering role for the study of aerobiology and allergic disease in this country and region.",

Campbelltown Hospital, Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Sydney, Australia. Background: Airborne pollen is a significant cause of allergic symptoms in sensitised individuals. Various meteorological factors have an effect on pollen levels, on a day to day basis throughout the pollen season, and on a seasonal basis over time. By understanding the effects of these meteorological factors, it may be possible to develop effective indicators which may assist in predicting high pollen days within a season to assist in symptom management. Method: Airborne pollen was collected between 1996Y2006 in Sydney, Australia. A Burkard 7 day volumetric spore trap was used to collect data and slides were made up and analysed using standard protocols. Pollen counts were expressed as grains per cubic Meter (CuM) for various species and then grouped into trees, grasses and weeds. Meteorological data was obtained and included minimum temperature, maximum temperature, daily rainfall and humidity. Spearman rank correlations were used to assess the effect of the meteorological variables upon the day to day pollen counts and the seasonal pollen counts as a whole. We then examined cross correlation plots between first differenced 4 day moving averages in order to detect short term associations between fluctuations in meteorological variables and fluctuations in pollen counts. Results: Examining daily counts within a given pollen season, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between daily maximum temperature and the daily pollen count for all pollen species (p G 0.05). Daily rainfall and high humidity were negatively correlated with the daily pollen count for all species (p G 0.05). Day to day changes in maximum temperature were moderately positively correlated with a simultaneous change in the total pollen count (r = 0.35), but weakly negatively correlated with a change in the total pollen count 4 days later (r = j0.15). Examining season to season associations, mean seasonal pollen counts were negatively correlated with mean seasonal daily maximum temperature ( r = j0.782 total pollen and r = j0.600 for grasses).",

The specific IgE reactivity pattern of European and American HDM allergic populations are well characterized. However, few studies have addressed the allergen-specific IgE pattern of Chinese HDM patients. Methods: Serum samples from 62 patients who had allergic asthma and/or allergic rhinitis and who showed skin prick test and UniCAP positive to Der p and Der f were obtained from South and Southwest of China. Sera were analyzed by crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis (CRIE) and immunoblotting to visualize the allergen-specific IgE reactivity patterns. Results: 23 allergens of Der p and 16 allergens of Der f were detected by CRIE. The most frequent allergens were identified to belong to HDM group 1 and 2. All sera had specific IgE against both Der p 1 and Der f 1, while 92 % of sera recognized Der p 2 and 95 % reacted against Der f 2. Antigen 16 of Der p showed IgE binding by 69%. After immunoblotting, patients' IgE mainly showed binding to proteins of around 25 and 14 kDa which were identified as HDM group 1 and 2 allergens, respectively. The reactions of the sera by immunoblotting were 53 % for Der p 1, 63 % for Der p 2, 31 % for Der f 1 and 59 % for Der f 2. Conclusion: The HDM specific IgE reactivity patterns of Chinese mite allergic patients are similar to that of other patient populations. In addition to the commonly recognized Der p 1, Der p 2, Der f 1 and Der f 2, a novel major allergen, denoted antigen 16, was identified in the Der p extract.

Methods: Five overlapping peptides, F1 (aa 1Y45), F2 (aa 41Y80), F3 (aa 70Y117), F4 (aa 1Y80), and F5 (aa 41Y117) were generated by PCR from Blo t 5 full-length cDNA. The IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 reactivities to these peptides and full length Blo t 5 were determined by ELISA assay with 20 Blomia tropicalis skin test positive children. The IgE ELISA unit was determined by a semipurified human IgE as standard curve, whereas IgG ELISA unit was determined by OD405nm X dilution factor. Results: The IgE epitope mapping experiments revealed very low levels of IgE binding to small peptides at N-terminal, F1 and F2 (p G 0.005) compared to F3, and larger peptides, F4 and F5, indicating that Blo t 5 major IgE epitopes were located at C-terminal and conformational dependent. In contrast, higher levels of IgG1 to F1 and F3 were found compared to F2 (p G 0.005) indicating that the major IgG1 epitopes are located at both the N-and C-terminal of Blo t 5. The peptides F1, F2, F3 and F4, bound lower levels of IgG4 (p G 0.005) than F5 suggesting that the IgG1 and IgG4 epitopes are unique and the major IgG4 epitopes seem to be located at C-terminal and conformational dependent. Conclusion: The data revealed both IgE and IgG4 epitopes are found mainly in the C-terminal of Blot 5 and are highly conformational dependent, whereas IgG1 epitopes are found throughout the whole Blot 5. The results suggest that recombinant hypoallergenic Blo t 5 for immunotherapy can be achieved by modifying the IgE epitopes while retaining the IgG epitopes.",

            "text": "Investigating pollen asthma deaths in islamabad, Pakistan Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Biology, Islamabad, Pakistan; 5 Pakistan Museum of Natural History, Botany, Islamabad, Pakistan. Introduction: Severe asthma and deaths have been reported in Islamabad during the spring allergy season, which affects thousands of residents. We investigated the deaths of 3 patients due to asthma, during the last ten days of March. In order to find a possible cause of these symptoms, we investigated the siblings of the deceased. Case 1: Male, 19 years, with a history of rhinitis during spring season, developed sudden difficulty in breathing while walking in the market, just after sunset. He was shifted to the nearest hospital. He died just on reaching the hospital, approximately 15 minutes after the onset of the attack. Case 2: A female medical doctor, 27 years, mother of 2 children aged 1 and 2 years, developed asthma suddenly about 1 hour after sunset. She was rushed to the hospital but, like the previous case, expired before reaching the hospital, approximately 20 minutes after onset of symptoms. Case 3: A 30 year old female, mother of 2 children aged 2 and 4 years, expired at home just before midnight, approximately 25 minutes after the onset of the first symptoms of asthma. Commonalities in all cases: All the deceased patients had a previous history of allergic rhinitis and occasional asthma during the spring pollen season in Islamabad. None had ever suffered from severe asthma, or been hospitalised. Very prominent is that the counts of Paper mulberry pollens were in excess of 30,000 grains / cm3 that day, and humidity was 980%, due to a forthcoming thunderstorm and rain. None of the patients was taking regular preventative treatment for allergy or asthma, at the time of the episode. None had been investigated for allergy during their lifetime. Methods: We contacted the siblings of the expired patients and found a positive history of seasonal spring allergy in 2 brothers of case 1, 4 sisters and one son of case 2, and one sister of case 3. One sibling each of cases 1 and 2 never reported any symptoms of asthma ever, while case 3 did not have any other sibling. Results: Skin prick allergy testing of all the symptomatic patients revealed strong results (more than 10 mm wheal) to pollens of paper mulberry (Broussenetia papyrifera) pollens. Conclusion: It is probable that the deceased patients suffered from allergy to pollens of paper mulberry, and expired due to the thunderstorm effect, during the peak of paper mulberry pollen allergy.",

Analysis of house dust samples collected from the houses of the asthmatic patients of Kolkata revealed a variety of acarine fauna of which the mites belonging to the genus Dermatophagoides predominated, comprising 60.4% of the total acarine population followed by Blomia tropicalis (16.6%) and Austroglycyphagus geniculatus (6.8%). Perusal of literature revealed that works on the role of house dust mites in allergic etiology mainly concentrated with the genus Dermatophagoides alone. No work incriminating the role of Blomia tropicalis in house dust allergy has yet been reported from India, although it contributes significantly towards the domestic acarine population. High prevalence of this mite species in the patients`environment tempted us to search for an allergic etiology towards this species of mite. Allergy skin test with house dust and house dust mites revealed an encouraging result against Blomia tropicalis. 72% allergic asthmatics of Kolkata responded positively towards this species of mites. The total serum IgE level in patients varies between 54 to 4040 KU/ ml (mean 369+487 KU/ml). Detection of allergen specific IgE antibodies against this species of mites also confirms its role in house dust allergy. 30% patients showed very high, 20% high and 40% showed moderate IgE level against this mite antigen. The present study incriminates Blomia tropicalis as an important source of allergen in house dust in Indian condition.",

Introduction: The prevalence of sensitization to allergens from house dust mites (HDM) in patients with respiratory allergens appears to be directly correlated with exposure. Objective: To explore sensitization to locally prepared allergenic extracts of HDM in patients with respiratory allergy at the Eastern of Kingdome of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods: House dust collected from different houses at KSA was put on culture media plates containing a mixture of charcoal, gypsum and water, which was then dried and wood excelsior with crushed maize for HDM nutrition was added. These were incubated in chamber with an adjustable relative humidity at 73% and temperature at 23 -C for one month with regular observation. Three types of HDM were isolated and cultured: {(Dermatophagoid Pteronyssinus (DP), Dermatophgoid Farinae (DF) and Blomia Tropicalis (BT)}. Allergenic extracts were prepared locally using the weight/volume method concentration 1/10 for skin prick test (SPT). Sensitization was based on a positive reactivity to standard SPT performed on patients with respiratory allergy. Results: 100 patients with the primary diagnoses of allergic rhinitis in 64 patients (64%) and bronchial asthma in 34 patients (34%) were studied. They aged from 8 to 62 years old (mean=32 T13SD). SPT was positive to: DP in 53 patients (53%) (44% polysensitization with other HDM and 9% monosensitization), DF in 46 patients (46%) (42 % polysensitization with other HDM and 4% monosensitization) and BT in 2 patients (2%) (2% polysensitization with other HDM). Conclusion: Prevalence of sensitization to locally prepared allergenic extracts of HDM, especially DP followed by DF, was predominant in patients with respiratory allergy seen in the Eastern of KSA. The sensitization to BT in few patients is described for the fist time and needs further evaluation in relationship to its significance in this geographical area. Properly manufactured extracts to other local allergens may help to determine new regional environmental factors for allergy.",

Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae and Blomia tropicalis and house dust allergens. Total serum IgE was measured by using EIA technique and specific IgE to these allergens measured by following Pharmacia Immuno CAP 100 System. The influence of age and gender, if any, on allergen sensitivity was also investigated. Results: The sensitisation rates among nasobronchial allergic patients to house dust and house dust mite allergen tested were as follow: house dust (96.22%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (75.06%), Blomia tropicalis (72%) and D. farinae(63.72%). The frequency of positive skin response was found to be independent of age and gender. The total serum IgE level in patients varies between 54Y4040 IU/ml ( mean 369 T 26.51). Specific IgE antibody test proved that 83% patients showed sensitivity towards at least one of the allergen tested. Discussion: Nasobronchial allergic patients are highly sensitive to the house dust and other three allergenic mites. Thus, these dust mites and house dust should be considered important allergenic sources of this area. A 19 year old white male with past history of Crohn`s disease presented to ED with one-week history of pain, rash and edema involving lower extremities. Pain was localized to his lower extremities bilaterally extending from mid shin to distal toes, particularly worse on the medial aspect of left foot. He also noticed pruritis and palpable rash in the same area. His palpable pruritic rash had improved to just a petechial rash by the time he presented. He did bring pictures of the rash when it was at its worst. There were no symptoms of exacerbation of Crohn`s disease. He was compliant with his medication. The occurrence of rash was temporally related to injection of Adalimumab, his last dose was 2 weeks prior to admission. Physical exam revealed edema of both lower extremities with scattered nonblanching petechial rash. There was also tenderness and decreased range of motion of ankle. There was no sensory deficit.",

In patients who develop this reaction, safe practice is to stop the TNF antagonist and treat with a regimen of steroids and antihistamines with or without immunosuppressive agents. This case represents a very rare hypersensitivity reaction to humanized antibody like Adalimumab. Drugs that antagonize TNF-\u00e1 have demonstrated their effect controlling inflammatory activity and inhibiting the progression of structural damage on patients with chronic arthropathies.

It is associated with various sideeffects that may affect intake. This is the first reported case of oral desensitization to Mitotane. Methods: We present an oral mitotane desensitization protocol in a patient who developed pruritic maculopapular rash and angioedema to mitotane. Results: This 18 year old patient diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma presented with a 5-year history of amenorrhea, hirshutism, striae and obesity. She underwent work-ups and excision biopsy on exploratory laparotomy revealed adrenocortical carcinoma. Prednisone was started and her symptoms subsequently resolved. On the 6th month post-surgery and medical treatment, there was recurrence of the same symptoms. She was restarted on prednisone and underwent another mass excision. Prednisone was discontinued. Mitotane was initiated at 500 mg tablet three times a day. After 1 week, she developed pruritic maculopapular rashes associated with angioedema and periauricular swelling within two hours of intake. She was then referred for mitotane desensitization. We used a protocol starting at an initial dose of 1/300th of the total dose doubling q 15 minutes reaching the total cumulative dose after 3 days of 1500 mg.

Robinson 3 . 1 Sheffield Teaching hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Clinical Immunology and Allergy Unit., Sheffield, United Kingdom; 2 Sheffield Teaching hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Clinical Immunology and Allergy Unit., Sheffield, United Kingdom; 3 Chesterfield Roayl Hospital, Medicine, Chesterfield, United Kingdom. Background: Immunologic responses to insulin in the form of IgG and IgE antibodies are common. Clinical problems related to these immunologic reactions are uncommon. Gell and Coombs type I, II, III and IV reactions have been reported. The antigenicity may be the result of any of several factors: insulin as a heterologous protein, altered tertiary structure of insulin, presence of non-insulin protein contaminants, or pharmaceutical formulation additives. IgE mediated local reactions are the most common and almost always subside spontaneously. With the use of human insulin these hypersensitivity reactions have become rare. Case report: We report a Type 2 diabetic who developed an interesting combination of significant immediate cutaneous reactions and delayed Type III and Type IV reaction to all the insulins including Human and recombinant preparations. Skin tests performed with all forms of commercially available insulin and insulin analogues were strongly positive, but skin tests were negative for solvents, excipients and additives. High titre specific IgE and IgG antibodies against insulin were demonstrated against bovine, porcine and human insulin. Attempted desensitization with subcutaneous insulin-human mixtard was initially unsuccessful. An intensive desensitisation regimen with subcutaneous administration of Human actrapid followed by human mixtard over 72 hours was done with the following Modified Insulin Desensitisation Schedule Results: On day 1, 0930 dose resulted in systemic urticaria after 45 minutes, the next dose was reduced to 1/3rd of the previous dose which caused the reaction and increments done by 1 units per injection. Hypoglycemia was prevented by infusing 5 % dextrose throughout the desensitisation procedure. After 96 hours patient was tolerating a Human mixtard dose 20 units and 10 units. Conclusion: This is an unusal case of insulin allergy resluting from multiple immunologic mechanisms which responded to a intensive desensitisation regimen. Within 6 months of successful induction of tolerance there was reduction in the IgG and IgE anti Y insulin titres.",

Background: Most patients with cutaneous hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exhibit clinical tolerance to specific inhibitors (coxibs) of cyclooxyge-nase-2 (COX-2). However, a subset of such patients will develop urticaria or angioedema when exposed to coxibs. The mechanisms of urticaria and angioedema due to coxibs are presently unknown. In this paper we discuss the prevalence of skin reactions due to coxibs and possible mechanisms mediating such adverse manifestations. Methods: A total of 206 patients (female 144, male 62, mean age 31.1T13.7 years) with urticaria and/or an-gioedema due to nonselective NSAIDs were studied between September 1999 and September 2005. Drug pattern showed 167 crossreactors (81%) and 39 single-reactors (19%), with a cutaneous clinical pattern in 122 (59.2%), mixed reactions (respiratory/cutaneous) in 82 (39.8%), and systemic reactions only in 2 (0.9%). Oral provocation tests were carried out with preferential and specific COX-2 inhibitors. In addition, a PubMed search of published studies on the tolerance to specific COX-2 inhibitors in NSAID-hypersensitive subjects was performed. Conclusion: Positive oral challenges with nimesulide were observed in 31% of studied patients, with meloxicam in 20.6%, with celecoxib in 18.4%, with etoricoxib in 11.2%, with valdecoxib in 10.3%, and with rofecoxib in 9.4%. While most NSAID-intolerant patients tolerated coxibs during oral challenges, a small subgroup of patients developed urticaria. Although there are few studies for valdecoxib and etoricoxib, these results are in agreement with the majority of published studies dealing with tolerability to rofecoxib (reaction rates 0Y34.7%) and celecoxib (reaction rates 0Y33.3%). Cutaneous reaction rates correlated with in vitro inhibition of COX-1 by different COX-2 inhibitors. Two possible mechanisms are proposed to explain urticaria induced by coxibs, an IgE-mediated allergic response, and inhibition of COX-1.",

Hemodialysis-associated hypersensitivity reactions are well documented in literature and majority would present as flushing, urticaria, periorbital and facial edema, bronchial hypersecretion and hypotension. This is the first reported case of hemodialysis-associated SJS. Methods: To present a patient who developed SJS after hemodialysis. Results: This is a 61-year old male diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, in uremia. Less than 24 hours after the initiation hemodialysis, patient developed generalized, pruritic, erythematous macular rahes. This was thought to be an adverse reaction to present antibiotics thus, all antibiotics were discontinued.",

This was thought to be a an anaphylactoid reaction to ethylene oxide present in dialyzers. Thus, pre-medication prior to subsequent hemodialysis was done. But on subsequent hemodialysis these lesions became localized flaccid bullae, later developing epidermal detachment involving the eyes and oral mucosa. He received intravenous hydrocortisone up to 200 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 3mg/kg/day methylprednisolone). However, patient`s condition worsened requiring endotracheal intubation. He subsequently died due to multi-organ failure. The strong history surrounding each hemodialysis sessions with the progression of his lesions plus the high index of suspicion pointed to ethylene oxide hypersensitivity as the cause of the SJS. Conclusion: This is the first reported case of hemodialysis-associated SJS. This case report demonstrates the importance of early detection, referral, and management of hemodialysis-associated hypersensitivity reaction. Replacing ethylene oxide with steam or gamma radiation may help solve this problem.",

Elshatory, Carlos Vital, Sandhya Mani, and Annette Fiorillo. Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Allergy/Immunology, New Orleans, United States. Background: In the United States (U.S.), more than 100,000 deaths annually are attributed to serious adverse drug reactions (including but not limited to drug allergy). The estimated total cost of these events in 1996 was 12.2 billion (U.S.) dollars. Polypharmacy, particularly in seniors, contributes to the increased likelihood of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Polypharmacy is defined as the use of five or more prescription medications on a long-term basis. There are no reports of intervention studies from the state of Louisiana (U.S.) where fifty percent of seniors are on polypharmacy in contrast to twenty percent prevalence in the rest of the United States. The goal of this pilot clinical observational study is to demonstrate whether cessation of inappropriate medications would decrease adverse drug reactions and lower the monthly cost of medications. Methods: Nine patients, ages 66 to 83 years, that met the definition of polypharmacy were evaluated. Patients with known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), transplant recipients, and malignancy were excluded secondary to known requirement of multiple medications. The Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI) was utilized to stop inappropriate medications. ADRs, Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) scores and monthly cost of medications were recorded before and after intervention. Results: The mean number of medications used daily decreased from 13.5 medications to 7.3 medications before and after intervention respectively. The ADRs decreased from 3.0 occurrences before intervention to 0.3 occurrences after intervention (pG0.001), while MMSE mean scores improved from 25.5 prior to intervention to 28. Tuberculosis continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently available drugs are effective for treatment of the disease or latent infection, but may cause serious allergic reactions, often difficult to manage. Once the diagnosis allergic drug reactions have been established, re-introduction of the drug, leading to tolerance can be considered, induction of tolerance is usually possible in most patients.",

A 59 year old man, who had taken Zyloric* pills for 15 years developed a maculopaplar rash (MPR) 3 days after the replacement of Zyloric* pills by its generic substitute called Allopurinol Ge*. Four days after stopping the intake of Allopurinol Ge* the MPR spontaneously disappeared. Biological findings remained normal without liver involvement. Two months after, the patient took Zyloric* again and developed generalized eruption with a more severe involvement of the flexure areas, the 3 days following the re-intake of the drug. This second CADR was less severe than the previous one. Three months later, the intake of Zyloric* was disrupted and the CADR vanished in 3 days. There was no other modification in the usual treatment. Dermato-allergological investigations were performed three months after the disappearance of the CADR and after stopping Zyloric*.

There are no common excipients between Zyloric* and its generic. In the few reported cases in literature of CADR occurring after the replacement of a drug by its generic substitute, the adverse effect does not relapse when the original drug is readministrated. Thus, to our knowledge, here is the first case in which the reintroduction of the original drug was associated with a relapse of the CADR. From our observation, new mechanisms must be evoked for this type of therapeutic accident, i.e. the role of excipients other than those listed on the pharmacological notice or a non tolerated commercialized form of the drug that induces a sensitization to the active compound.",

Materials and Methods: 67 patients (52 women, 15 men, mean age 50,6 y.o) referred for immediate (13, 4%) or delayed (86,6%) cutaneous adverse reaction (CAR) possibly due to a CS systemically administered, were enrolled. All had PT with a special series of 12 CS diluted in petrolatum, read at 20 minutes, 48h, 96h and one week. When negative, pt were carried out with tixocortol, budesonide, betamethasone, betamethasone dipropionate, hydrocortisone 17 butyrate, triamcinolone acetonide and the involved CS. If PT and pt were negative, IDT were carried out at least with one CS of each group of the Goossens classification (1): hydrocortisone (group A), triamcinolone acetonide (group B), betamethasone (group C), betamethasone dipropionate (group D1), with progressively increasing dosages. If skin tests were negative, oral provocation tests with the involved CS or another CS (same group or different group) were proposed. Oral administrations were performed under hospital surveillance, versus placebo, with progressively increasing concentrations to the full dosage. Results: 12 patients (18%) had positive results either on skin testing or oral administration. PT were positive in 5 cases (7.5 %), none had positive pt, 3 patients had positive IDT, one had a positive repeated open application test. In 58 patients all tests were negative. Thirty-eight accepted one or more oral administrations (OA) of CS (50 OA were performed). Among them, 1/21 had a positive OA to the involved CS, 1/9 had a positive OA to a CS belonging to the same group; 2/20 had a positive OA with a CS belonging to another group. Conclusion: Hypersensitivity to systemic CS is supposed to be rare but do exist, as we confirmed a CS sensitization in 12 patients with an immediate or delayed mechanism. We demonstrated that skin tests are useful in the management of such patients. They have a mean value in investigating suspected CS hypersensitivity, but they are well tolerated and seem to have a good negative predictive value (92.1 % in our series). They allow to confirm a sensitization (positive tests) and to lead the OA in the initially responsible chemical group of CS or in another group with a low risk of reactivity.",

In this study $-lactams were more frequently associated with pollen allergy than non steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDS). The aim of the present study is to verify if the association pattern has changed. Methods: 952 patients allergic to pollens and 141 with hypersensitivity to drugs have been studied in the last five years. 47 patients were simultaneously allergic to pollens and drugs (4,9% of pollinosis) (33,3% of drug allergy). Clinical history, skin prick tests for pollens and prick and ID when necessary for drugs, specific IgE when possible done in all the 47 patients. Results: 32 females (68,1%) and 15 males (31,9%), previously Females (54,4%) Males (45,6%). 40 patients (85,1%) attended by pollinosis and 7 (14,9%) by drug allergy. In pollen allergy clinics was rhinitis in 45 and asthma alone in 2. Drug allergy: urticaria-angioedema in 32 (68,8%), shock in 2, bronchospasm in 2. Skin prick tests-grass pollens 32 (68%), Parietaria 19 (40,2%), olive tree 12 (25,5%). Drug allergy: $-lactams 19 (40,4%), NSAIDS 24 (51,1%) and other drugs (16,2%). There was no correlation between allergy to one specific pollen and a group of drugs. Conclusion: The association of pollinosis with drug allergy is not very frequent. Reporting to the results previously obtained in these series there is a greater number of grass pollens allergy instead of Parietaria and a greater incidence of NSAIDS hypersensitivity instead of $-lactams. These results can be explained by a decrease of antibiotics prescription to allergic patients and an increase in the use of NSAIDS in the last few years. Background: Drug hypersensitivity is a common clinical problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality. According to Volchek (2004) , adverse drug reactions are a major health issue encountered frequently in both the inpatient and the outpatient setting. Over the past few years, with the increasing number of medications that have been manufactured, there has been an increasing emphasis on pharmacotherapeutic vigilance in order to reduce the incidence of such reactions. Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to review records of patients referred to for adverse drug reactions and determine the most commonly implicated drugs, most common clinical manifestations as well as to look into the source of the referral or the consult. Methods: Chart review and frequency distribution Results: A total of 1,694 patients were referred to the Allergy Section from 2002Y2006 with a slowly increasing trend each year. Forty percent of these patients were seen at the outpatient clinic and 60% were in-patient referrals. Among those admitted, the number of adult and pediatric cases were nearly the same (54% and 46% respectively). In the out-patient clinics, adult referrals outnumbered pediatric cases by more than two-thirds. The most common manifestations in the inpatient setting were cutaneous reactions (maculopapular rashes, urticaria, angioedema), followed almost equally by jaundice, difficulty breathing, fever and chills. Rare generalized reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) were also reported, averaging 10 cases per year. The most commonly implicated drugs for both in-and outpatient settings was still beta-lactam antibiotics, followed by anti-tuberculosis medications, anticonvulsants, ASA/NSAIDs and others (L-asparaginase, vitamin K and allopurinol). Over the five year period there was an increasing trend of. Conclusion: Results have shown that over the past five years, although the implicated medications are the same, there has been an increasing trend in the reporting of adverse drug reactions. This is most probably due to the fact that there is a heightened awareness regarding the issue. An increasing number of brand names and manufacturers may also lead to an increased number of adverse reactions to medications.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the negative predictive value (NPV) of drug skin tests. Patients and Methods: After a retrospective analysis of the files of patients referred for CADR between 1996 and 2006, we have enrolled those having CADR with clinical features, onset`s delay after the drug intake and drug imputability strictly determined, having had negative drug skin tests followed by drug administrations. There were oral provocation tests (OPT) or substitution tests (ST) with a drug of the same class of those of the drug suspected during the CADR. Methods: The files of 9 067 patients have been reviewed. Clinical presentation and suspected drugs registered. Skin tests with the group of drug incremated have been done by prick and intradermal techniques in progressive concentrations when prick were negative informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Specific IgE or leucotrienes release has been done in cases these techniques are available. Results: 448 (4,9%) out of 9 067 patients reported one or more drug adverse reactions: (females 69,7%, males 30,3%). 90% of the patients reported urticaria/angiodema and 10% rhinitis and/or asthma. NSAIDS were implied in 63,6% of the patients, $-lactams in 34,2%, local anesthetics in 4,7%. Associations of reactions to NSAIDS and $-lactams were frequent (22,3%) other drug less implied were sulfa drugs, quinolones, macrolides, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II blockers, statins, corticosteroids, vitamines, allopurinol, tetracyclin, gentamycin, furadantine, curarisers, tramadol, ranitidin, thyocholchycosid, fibrates, fluconazol. Specific IgE and CAST (leucotrienes release) were positive only in less than 50% of the cases. Conclusion: NSAIDS and $-lactams are the more frequent cause of adverse reactions in out-patients clinical history, skin tests step by step are the more practical first diagnostic approach of drug allergy in out-patients. Drug hypersensitivity can cause asthma, allergic rhinitis or both (Fermaid Widal triad) in a non-negligible number of patients atopic or non-atopic.",

Fran0ois Cuny 1 , J. Luc Schmutz 1 , and Annick Barbaud 1 . 1 Hopital Fournier, Dermatology, Nancy, France; 2 CHU, Pharmacovigilance, Nancy, France. Objective: With the emergence of hightly resistant staphylococcus, vancomycin (V) and teicoplanine (T) usage has considerably increased but they can induce cutaneous adverse reactions (CAR) for which the value of immunoallergical investigations has not yet been determined. Methods: Retrospective study (2006Y2006) including 9 patients (6 women, 3 men; mean age = 54.3) with CAR suspected to be due to glycopeptides, V: 4 cases, T: 4 cases and successively V then T: 1 case. Red man syndromes were not included. Imputability was estimated according to Moore's criteria. The CAR were 6 maculopapular rashes, 1 linear bullous dermatosis, 1 DRESS and 1 urticaria. Six weeks later, according to ESCD's guideline for drug skin tests, immunoallergological investigations were carried out with successively drug patch tests, prick tests and intradermal tests with all the drugs taken during the CAR. Results: Skin tests confirmed the responsibility of glycopeptides in 4/9 cases, with cross-reactivity between V and T in 2/5 cases. Following negative immuno-allergical investigations, 3 patients had well tolerated provocation tests with glycopeptides. Conclusion: In literature, T seems to be safer than V (ototoxicity, rashes, nephrotoxicity) for a similar efficacy, inducing very few hypersensitivity reactions such as red man syndrome (3 cases published). Allergic crossreactivity (V and T), already reported in literature, is not so rare (2 of our patients) but unconstant (3 of our patients had indeed well tolerated provocation tests with the other glycopeptide and we precise that all the skin tests were negatives for V and T in these patients. In that way, this study has important clinical implications, demonstrating that skin tests are useful in CAR due to glycopeptides, in determining the responsible drug and if the tests are negative, allowing the readministration of another glycopeptide with hospital surveillance, as we demonstrated that cross-reactivity between glycopeptides is not constant.",

Wroclaw Medical University, Department of Internal Medicine and Allergology, Wroclaw, Poland. Background: Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (iACE) and Blockers of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 blockers) are commonly used in hypertention and chronic heart failure treatment. These therapies are believed to be safe. However, angioedema is a rare but a well recognized potentially life-threatening adverse effect of iACE therapy. The aim of the study was to estimate angioedema threat in patients treated with short and long acting iACE in comparison to patients receiving AT1 blockers. Eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) and eotaxin serum concentrations were used as indicators of the angioedema threat, since bradykinin is involved in the activation of this chemokine and subsequently eosinophils.",

            "text": "Fixed drug eruption caused by traditional herbal medicine (jamu) Background: Fixed drug eruption (FDE) are so named because they recur at same site with each exposure to the medication. Jamu is the term commonly used to describe traditional herbal medicine products from Indonesia. The medicinal elements may be made from roots, bark, leaves, fruits, flowers, seeds or other parts of a plant. Jamu pegal linu indicated for the treatment of rheumatism, body ache and bone ache, muscle joint, giddiness, toothache and backache usually consumed by hard workers. Commercial products are available in the form of powders, pills, capsules, mixtures and creams. Some illegal retailers adding phenylbutazone, allopurinol and paracetamol in to jamu. FDE caused by jamu has never been reported yet. Case: A 40-year-old man presented with multiple black macules on the upper left eyebrow, left and right cheeks, lower lip and left and right hands. The lesions initially appeared small and only a few, enlarge slowly, and became obvious and of concern to the patient in the past 2 weeks. The lesions were slightly itchy but there was no pain. He was otherwise healthy. He denied taking any medication except traditional herbal medicine (jamu) for the past 1 year when feeling tired. Family history was negative. Laboratory examinations were within normal limits. Skin biopsy from one of his lesions showed some vaculolar degeneration of the basal cells, pigmentary incontinence, mild superficial perivascular limpho-histiocytic infiltrates with a few eosinophils. Discussion: The clinical presentation and histopathologic alterations are consistent with the diagnosis of fixed drug eruption. The patient was treated 857 Anaphylactic reactions during general anaesthesia: diagnostic approach and prevalence of anaesthetics involvement Mauro Cancian 1 , Muzio Meroni 2 , Raffaele Bendo 1 , Elena Ossi 1 , and Giuseppe Realdi 1 . 1 Clinica Medica 1-University of Padova, Medical and Surgical Department, Padova, Italy; 2 ISTAR-University of Padova, Pharmacology and Anesthesiology Department, Padova, Italy. Background: Although anaphylactic reactions during general anaesthesia show a very low incidence, the mortality reaches 5% or more, and additional patients may experience significant brain damage. Neuromuscular blocking drugs are usually reported as the most common cause of anaesthesia-elicited anaphylaxis, but the possible involvement of induction agents, antimicrobials, latex, plasma expanders and other drugs should be considered. Unfortunately, the diagnostic approach is limited by the lack of validated commercial kits for detection of specific antibodies, as well as by the occurrence of pseudoallergic reactions, that are not mediated by circulating IgE. Methods: We evaluated 20 consecutive cases (14 F, 6 M; age range 16Y68 yrs) of well documented anaphylaxis during general anaesthesia, by laboratory assays (WBC count; Eosinophil cationic protein; Serum Tryptase; Plasma C4 and C1-INH; IgA and total IgE levels; RAST for inhalant and food allergens, latex and beta-lactams) and skin tests (Patch and/or Prick testing; intradermal injection) for inhalant allergens, eggs, soybeans and exotic fruit, latex and drugs administered before or during anaphylaxis onset. Drug skin tests were performed with commercial formulations of beta-lactams, heparin, atropine, benzodiazepins, vecuronium, norcuronium, mivacurium, rocuromium, fentanyl, remifentanyl, propofol, droperidol and thiopental, at different dilutions. Results: Two patients showed evidence of allergy to norcuronium and mivacurium, respectively. Three subjects were allergic to amoxicillin and six to latex. Heparin skin testing elicited a local weal-and-flare response in one patient, whilst diffuse urticaria and itching were observed in one case. Finally, apparent anaphylaxis followed by cardiac arrest during anaesthesia in an asthmatic subject, seemed to be an adverse effect of a difficult intubation rather than a true allergic or pseudoallergic reaction. Unfortunately, in the remaining six patients we were not able to identify any triggering factors, also because no diagnostic tests are available to assess NSAIDs hypersensitivity. Conclusion: Latex allergy still represents, at least in our experience, the main cause of anaphylaxis during general anaesthesia. Although the reliability of skin testing with commercial drugs has not been well established till now, this procedure can help to prevent the risk of further episodes in patients with a documented anaphylactic reaction during anaesthesia.",

Fukuoka National Hospital, Pediatrics, Fukuoka City, Japan. Background: Corticosteroid preparations have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties and are widely used in the treatment of asthma and allergic disorders. However, steroids themselves can rarely induce hypersensitivity reactions. The severity of the reaction can vary from a rash to anaphylaxis or death. We report four cases regarded as the steroid allergy that we experienced in our hospital recently. Case Report: Case 1 was the 9 years old girl and hospitalized with moderate asthma attack. Rash developed in several minutes when she was given aminophilin continuous intravenous infusion and hydrocortisone succinate (HC-S) 6mg/kg intravenous drip. An intradermal test by HC-S was positive and we diagnosed the drug allergy. We changed it to predonine (PSL) intravenous infusion, rash didn't develop but persistence of wheeze and decreased FEV1.0. The symptom and lung function were improved when all steroid were canceled. Case 2 was 10 years old girl with many kinds food allergy and hospitalized with moderate asthma attack. She was given aminophilin continuous intravenous infusion, hydrocortisone succinate (HC-S) 7mg/kg intravenous drip and PSL 1.0mg/kg$B!_#4(B/day intravenous injection for 8 days. She showed persistence of wheeze and decreased$B!!(B-FEV1.0. She was diagnosed steroid allergy and pertussis infection. By an intradermal test, she showed positive for PSL, HC-S, methylprednisolone succinate(MP-S), hydrocortisone sodium phosphate. Wheeze and FEV1.0 were improved by all steroid cancellation. Case 3 was a 23 years old female patient hospitalized with moderate asthma attack. It was similar to case 2, she had intractable wheeze and decreased FEV1.0 persisted. By an intradermal test, she showed positive for PSL, HC-S and she was diagnosed steroid allergy. Case 4 was a 10 years old boy with moderate asthma attack developed urticaria and hypotension after receiving HC-S intravenous drip. In this patient the intradermal tests HC-S and PSL showed positive and diagnosed steroid allergy. Conclusion: 3 in 4 cases did not show anaphylactic reaction. There were many cases which showed persistence of wheeze and decreased FEV1.0 during treatment of asthma. We thought that the steroid allergy that took the course to protract of asthma attack could be present from these cases. It is important to considerate striod allergy in treatment of acute exacerbation of intractable asthma.",

Allergy and Respiratory Diseases Clinic, Genoa University, Department of Internal Medicine, Genoa, Italy. Background: Despite the large use of corticosteroids (CS), allergic reactions to these drugs remain uncommon; Immediate allergic reactions to CS are uncommon events usually provoked by excipients. Both immunologic and nonimmunologic mechanisms are proposed. Delayed reactions are compatible with a T-cell mediated response. Cross-reactivity has been observed between different topical corticosteroids, but the classification of crossreactivity between them does not seem to be completely useful in adverse reactions to systemic corticosteroids. Case report. We signal the case of a 39year-old woman with no atopy but contact sensitization to tixocortol-21pivalate 1%. The woman, before a recent administration of mepivacaine for dental surgery, had proceeded with CS preventive administration (Prednisone 50mg 13hh, 7 hh and and clorfenamine 1h before the intervention). One hour after the last dose of premedication, followed by anahestetic administration, patient presented facial angioaedema. Further administration of metilprednisolone to treat the adverse event had the effect of increasing symptoms. Management: Patient was studied for corticosteroids allergy. Patch test, performed with Standard Series, confirmed mentioned sensitization. Skint tests were carried out with metilprednisolone succinate, betametasone fosfate, triamcinolone acetodine. Patient showed immediate local reaction after intradermoreaction with metilprednisolone; no positivity for other CS tested.",

            "text": "Comments: Tixocortol-21-pivalate and prednisone belong to group A corticosteroids, so a possible cross reaction may be suggestive. As CS are poorly soluble in water or saline, they are coupled with esters. In this circumstance patient reacted to both the previous administration of prednisone and then to metilprednisolone; these two preparations are different only for the presence of succinate ester in the second one, so an effect of this additive may reasonably be excluded. Therefore all other excipients included in the tested preparations were commonly existing in both tolerated and untolerated drugs. Conclusion: Drug adverse reactions appearing altough preventive administration of systemic CS should be reconsidered for possible allergic response to CS. The classification of cross reactivity between CS, with patch testing and intredermal testing, may provide useful support to confirm diagnosis and to identify alternative tolerated molecules. Background: Erythema multiforme is a reaction pattern of blood vessels in the dermis with secondary epidermal changes and manifests clinically as characteristic erythematous iris-shaped papular, little or no mucous membrane involvement; vesicles but no bullae or systemic symptoms. Eruption is usually confined to extremities, face, classic target lesions. Case: A 56 year-old girl with erythema multiforme minor developed typical lesions involving most of the skin. The eruptions developed after she had taken some medicines for antihypertension. Histopathology result showed focal hyperkeratosis, acantosis, focal spongiosis in epidermis and inflammatory cell infiltrate: lymphocytes and eosinophil in dermis without vacuolar degeneration. Discussion: Mild forms have appearance of little or no mucous membrane involvement, vesicles but no bullae or systemic symptoms. In this case there were erythematous patchs and vesicles in his skin. This eruption is usually confined to extensor aspects of extremities, and classic target lesions. Clinical manifestation characteristic by classic target lesions that characterized for erythema multiforme but histopathology examination showed appearance like drug eruption without vacuolar degeneration, that mean there is discrepancy of clinical appearance and histopathology. Mild form of erythema multiforme may developed to severe erythema but in this case the lesion improved after treatment with steroid equivalent of dexamethasone 30mg orally a day in divided doses. Conclusion: There is discrepancy of clinical appearance and histopathology. Erythema multiforme in this patient well responded to corticosteroid, withdrawal of all possible offending drugs, and supportive therapy. Prompt diagnosis and treatment give good result.

Background: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is an uncommon fulminating mucocutaneous disease associated with high prevalence of mortality. Frequently TEN is associated to drug administration. TEN due to fluoroquinolones are rare, 7 case reports in Medline with TEN due to ciprofloxacin. Allergic reactions due to fluoroquinolones are very rare. Anaphylactoid and/or anaphylactic reactions are estimated to occur in 0.46-1.2 in 100,000 patients. Fluoroquinolones are new antibiotic drugs used mostly in treatment of urinary and respiratory infections. Allergy to fluoroquinolones may have many clinical manifestation: anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction, acute urticaria with or without angioedema, fixed drug eruption, serum sick-like illness, nummular eczema. The most frequent used quinolones in Romania are ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. 2812 patients were evaluated in the department of Allergy, in Cluj Napoca between Jan 2005YDec 2006. Only 14 (0.49%) cases of allergic reaction due fluoroquinolones were reported. Case report: A 29-years-old smoking man was admitted in our hospital with malaise, with an eritematous eruption in the whole skin with small areas of denudation of epithelium, ulcers in nasal and oral mucosa. Those phenomena were associated with a severe itching and burning sensation of the skin. The patient began 10 days ago treatment with ciprofloxacin for an acute bronchitis, that was the only drug he took in the last 6 months. After a complete examination the patient presented also hepatocitolisis. After treatment with corticosteroids, antibiotics intense care of the skin the patient recover complete. Evolution in 2 months was Brestitutio at integrum^. Conclusion: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare, but the increasing rates of reports for this syndrome due to ciprofloxacin could reconsider first choice option for this drug. More studies should be done in order to find the prevalence of TEN to ciprofloxacin.",

Pruritus and rash are the most common cutaneous side effects associated with nimesulide. Toxic epidermal necrolysis induced by drugs is a rare, potentially lethal syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of widespread blistering of the skin. To the best of our knowledge there have been no previous reports of toxic epidermal necrolysis induced by the ingestion of nimesulide in the medical literature. Case: A 68 years old woman, Buginesse. Previous history she ever had TEN six years ago probable caused by paracetamol and metamphiron. The diagnosis was established based on anamnesis and clinical manifestations. The lesions consisted of generalized erythema, vesicles, bullae, Nikolsky sign was positive, erosions, and epidermolisis more than 30%. Treatment was parenteral infusion, dexamethasone intravenous 10 mg, cimetidine 1 ampule, ciprofloxacin injection per drip and topically with silver sulfadiazine and framycetin sulfate for erosion and denuded area. Discussion: This case was diagnosis as toxic epidermal necrolysis based on anamnesis and clinical manifestations. The most frequent cause is drugs, 80% of cases have strong association with spesific medication. The probable cause was nimesulide. Clinical manifestations toxic epidermal necrolysis are extensive epidermal necrosis, and exfoliation of the skin. There is almost no normal skin seen and in this form over 80% on the skin surface is involved. Day 10th of hospitalization death ensued from sepsis and multiple organ failure.

Background: Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a diffuse, severe, mucocutaneous eruption involving two or more mucosal surfaces with or without visceral involvement most often induced by drugs and occasionally elicited by infections. Sulfasalazine is a sulfa drug. The metabolite of sulfasalazine may trigger an immune-response leading to cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Case: A 29 years old woman presented symptoms of skin, mucous membrane and eye lesions. She had taken sulfasalazine for several days before the eruptions. Physical examination revealed erythema, and blisters affected on the face, neck, arms, upper trunk, erosions of the lips, and conjunctivitis. Histopathology examination of skin lesion showed Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) appearance. The patient was treated with ringer lactate, dexamethasone 5 mg per 6 hours, gentamycin 80 mg per 12 hours intravenously, and topical steroids. After being hospitalized for 14 days, the patient cured without complications. Discussion: This case is diagnosed as SJS based on anamnesis and clinical examinations, confirmed by histopathology finding subepidermal bullae with necrosis of entire epidermis and inflammatory infiltrate, according to TEN appearances. This case may be a degree of overlap as forms of SJS can evolve into TEN. Sulfasalazine is a sulfa drug, used primarily as an anti-inflammatory agent. SJS due to sulfasalazine is rare. Conclusion: SJS due to sulfasalazine is rare. SJS is a life threatening cutaneous adverse drug reaction and can evolve into TEN. Early appropriate treatment may produce an excellent prognosis in SJS.

In fact, shots of common vaccine DPT (diphtheriapertussis-tetanus may in rare cases trigger serious health problems. In reviewing existing data, the several studies found a link between the pertussis component of the DPT vaccine and anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction. Vaccines have been highly effective at eliminating or significantly decreasing the incidence of many once-common diseases. However, the public is now focusing on the potential adverse effects of vaccines. The aim of this study was to identify the adverse effects of DPT immunization in children up to 6 years of age in Tabriz/Iran. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted in the city of Tabriz in North-West Iran. Cases were defined as those notified with Adverse effects of DPT immunization over a 6 months period (between September 23, 2006 -to March 20, 2007 in Tabriz health centers. All of the children aged 2 months up to 6 years who recived DPT vaccine in our selected health centers, were carefuly checked up to 72 hours following immunization. A questionnaire was used to elicit information related to Adverse effects of DPT immunization in children. The data was anayzed by software of SPSS/ Win. Results: The findings indicated that fever, limb swelling, unusual crying, irritability, vomiting, erythema were 47.8%, 42%, 37%, 25%, 13%, 11.8% respectively. Conclusion: As immunizations are usually given to healthy people for prevention of serious diseases, the risks for known adverse reactions to the vaccine must be weighed against the potential benefits. Nurses and health providers should be prepared to answer patients' or parents' parents questions about common as well as alleged vaccine-related adverse events and must utilize the Vaccine Information Statements for vaccines covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.",

Background: The anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome is a potentially fatal multisystemic reaction to anticonvulsant medications. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. Results: A total 32 subjects, aged from 6 to 72 years, diagnosed as having anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome based on clinical and histopathological findings, were included in the study. In 22 of the 32 cases, the anticonvulsants had been administered prophylactically after craniotomy and in 10 cases for epilepsy. When the cases were assessed for skin lesions, maculopapular eruption was registered in 22, Stevens-Johnson syndrome in five, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in five. Treatment included suspension of the offending drug and then, except for the cases with toxic epidermal necrolysis, administration of corticosteroids. The 22 cases that required anticonvulsant therapy were treated with valproic acid. In all cases, we observed rapid clinical improvement corroborated by laboratory findings. Conclusion: It is essential that due importance be given to the development of an eruption in individuals to whom anticonvulsants are administered after craniotomy because anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome is likely to be life-threatening.",

This patient has in anamnesis such episodes of allergic reactions related to a number of drugs of different pharmaceutical groups. The patient got a heavy allergic dermatitis to an Isosorbide in a dripping form. The cancellation of this drug and the prescription of antihistamines didn't improve the situation. The patient examination with analyzer UniCap-100 brings to light an existence of specific IgE c73 substances (Insulin Human). The abolition of this drug was impossible due to the danger of decompensation of the diabetes. Tests in vivo were impossible in consequence of the activity of cutaneous process. That's why the client passed the Damage Measure of Neutrophils Test (DMNT) in the modified scheme. The hypersensibility related to a number of drugs was displayed. From such types of insulin that obtained negative results Insulin NPH and Insulin Rapid were administrated. Parallel to this, the patient was prescribed to take a intravenous Prednisolone (120 mg/day for 5 days), after that, the treatment was transferred to steroids per os in the dose of 10 mg/day for one month with the gradual dose decrease and the following cancellation. Glycemic profile had normalized and effects of heavy allergic dermatitis had regressed completely. Conclusion: In the case of the appearance of the DA on the vitally important drugs, the cancellation of the given drug is contraindicated. It's because, in the case of further necessity of emergency infusion, the risk of anaphylactic shock is increasing. The DMNT (sensitivity is about 95%, specificity-about 80%) in the modified scheme is the effective method due to the impossibility of conduction of more trustworthy tests in vitro and in vivo. Monitoring showed the effectiveness and safety of the prednisolone course for the treatment of DA.",

Ilyas 1 . 1 Medical Faculty Hasanuddin University / Dr. Wahidin Medical Faculty Hasanuddin University, Pathology, Makassar, Indonesia. Background: Drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) is an idiosyncratic and life-threatening adverse drug reaction that begins acutely in the first 2 months after initiation of drug and is characterized by fever, skin rash, facial edema, or an exfoliative dermatitis, lymphadenopathy, hematological abnormalities (eosinophilia) and multi-organ involvement. In this case, there were no other systemic organ involvement. Case: A 26-years-old woman presented with fever, maculopapular rash, facial edema and lymph nodes enlarged 2 weeks after taking cefadroxil and mefenamic acid after fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for suspect thyroid infection. After taking mebhydrolin napadysilate the rash become extended as an exfoliative dermatitis, facial edema, and lymphadenopathy. Laboratory examination including leucocytosis and eosinophilia. There were no other biologic abnormalities including normal liver function test, chest radiograph and cardiac echography. Histology examination showed hyperkeratosis, mild spongiosis, vacuolar degeneration of basal cells with infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophil and eosinophil. Discussion: The patient fulfilled the clinical criteria with her presentation of fever, generalized maculopapular rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia. The pathogenesis of DHS is not fully understood, including genetic background, altered drug metabolism, and virus infection. The suspect drug was mebhydrolin napadysilate. The treatment was dexamethason intravenously started with 15 mg tid. Topical steroid and emollient were given also. After 3 weeks, dexamethasone intravenously was substitute with methyl prednisolone 24 mg orally a day and tapered. The rash progressively improved. Conclusion: Drug hypersensitivity syndrome is a severe skin reaction with systemic manifestations. Internal organ involvement can be asymptomatic. The suspect drug was mebhydrolin napadysilate. The treatment of dexamethasone intravenously continued with methylprednisolone oral and withdrawal of possible offending drug gave a good result. Background: Adverse reactions to pharmaceutical and diagnostic products constitute a major hazard in the practice of medicine. Multiple risk factors have been shown to modify the clinical expression of immunologic drug reactions. These can be associated with the drug itself, with the disease state in which the drug is used(chronic disease and infections), or the individual patient receiving the drug. Similarly, some allergic drug reactions are much more likely to occur if the drug is administered to patients with particular disease backgrounds, as when aminopenicillins are given to patients with atypical or abnormal lymphocytes or sulfonamides to patients with AIDS. Case Report: We represent a 63-year-old man with prolonged history (more than one year)of intermittent headache and use of NSAIDS. He had recurrent history of anaphylaxis and urticaria after getting NSAIDS at first, and with the other analgesics and also antihistamines there after. His laboratory evaluation, includind cell blood count and differentials and complement assay was in normal limits, He consulted with a neurologist, and brain CT-scan was done. It showed CNS tumor. In literature review it was found a few chronic diseses such as cyctic fibrosis or cryogobulinemia (or also immune deficiencies) can cause drug allergy but there was no association between multiple drug allergy and malignancies especially CNS tumors. Background: Dapsone Hypersensitivity Syndrome (DHS) is a rare well recognized serious adverse effect characterized by fever, skin rashes, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatitis and hepato-splenomegaly. Hipersensitivity reaction occur during first 6 weeks, but can occur after 6 months. Objective: To find out the total cases for 2 years of dapson hypersensitivity syndrome in the wahidin sudirohusodo general hospital, Makassar, Indonesia. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out taken from medical record and registration book. (January 2005 -December 2006 . Results: Five patients with dapson hypersensitivity syndrome were reported. All patients received dapsone as a part of MDT for leprosy. Fever, jaundice, skin lesion were detected in 5 cases, but 1 case appearance like morbiliform. Lymphadenopathy (2 cases), splenomegaly and acut psychosis (1 case). Laboratory data on admission included : low hemoglobin, leucocytosis, elevated level of serum liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation, raised bilirubin and hypoproteinemia. The interval between start of dapsone therapy and appearance of symptoms varied from 2Y7 weeks. But one case the clinical manifestation occur 8 months after consumption of Multi drug treatment(MDT). All cases were treated with corticosteroids after withdrawing dapsone, MDT was continued by replacing dapsone with minocyclin. Background: Lemierre's syndrome is an acute oropharyngeal infection with suppuration of the lateral pharyngeal space, bacteremia and septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, causing metastatic infection. It is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1 case per million. Methods: We report a patient diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome who presented with a rash after 2 weeks of piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin and phenytoin. Results: This 27 year old male with no significant past medical illness presented with a one week history of a dento-alveolar abscess of the right molar, fever, trismus, dysphagia with erythema and swelling of the neck. Work up showed a retropharyngeal extension of the dento-alveolar abscess, pneumonia, pneumomediastinum and necrotizing mediastinitis. HIV enzyme immunoassay was negative. The patient underwent cervical mediastinotomy with subxiphoid drainage and was given piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5g IV q8 and clindamycin 300mg IV q6. During the course of his hospital stay, the patient went into arrest, had post-gliottic seizures and was started on phenytoin 100mg cap q8.",

Background: The aetiology of lichen planus is unknown. Stress, autoimmunity and infection have been suggested as possible causes. Many drugs can provoke eruptions that clinically and histologically are similar to lichen. We describe in two patients a probable association between treatment with irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide and lichenoid eruption. Case Reports: Case 1: An 80-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 4month history of acute onset of violaceus papules which started on her arms and spread to her trunk, back and legs. She had been taking amiodarone for auricular fibrillation for 15 months and irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension for 8 months. On physical exam, the patient had accurate violaceus and scaly plaques on the trunk, back and limbs. There were no ocular, buccal or genital lesions and she had no systemic symptoms. Blood count and biochemical profile were normal. Skin biopsy of involved skin showed typical features of lichen planus. Treatment with desonide and cetirizine provided no relief. Irbesrtan-hydrochlothiazide was substituted by irbesartan and the skin eruption and prutitis had resolved within two weeks. Case 2: A 56-year-old man presented with acute onset of a pruritic rash which stated on his trunk and spread to his whole body. His past medical history included hypertension and Sharp syndrome for which he was taking irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide and methotrexate. Methotrexate and irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide were started approximately 2 years and 8 months before skin eruption respectively. On physical exam, the patient had accurate violaceus and scaly plaques on the trunke, back and limbs. There were bilateral shallow erosions of the buccal mucosa surrounded by a network of lacy white striae. Blood count and biochemical profile were normal. Skin biopsy of involved skin showed typical features of lichen planus. Treatment with desonide and cetirizine provided no relief. Irbesrtan-hydrochlothiazide was substituted by irbesartan and the skin eruption and prutitis had resolved within two weeks. Conclusion: These observations illustrate a rare association between lichen and hydrochlorothiazide (On the basis of the Naranjo algorithm, it is probable that the systemic reaction was due to hydrochlorthiazide therapy). Clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse effect and recommend with-holding the drug intake when temporal relation is evocative.",

Background: It is estimated that a round 20-30% of people all over the world suffer from allergy. Contact with certain materials (allergens) is supposed to cause allergic skin sensitization culminating in development of contact dermatitis in some individuals. Some people are unaware of their sensitization as it shows no or mild symptoms. The prevalence of specific allergens varies by geographic area, population, age and sex. Objective: The present study aimed at determining the relative frequency of positive reactions to different sensitizers among hostel female students in Ajman University-UAE. Materials and Methods: Sampling approach was simple and descriptive. 46 female hostel students aged between 19Y26 years were tested using the Universal standard patch test series (TRUE test) containing 23 common allergen sensitizers and a negative control. Cross sectional questionnaire was distributed for the same students and those with chronic diseases or pregnancy were excluded. Results: The results were analyzed by SPSS. In contrast to previous European reports which suggest that nickel sensitization is the most common among females, this study shows that thimerosal is the common sensitizer among female hostel university students (32.6%), followed by nickel 15.2% and colophony 8.69%. Conclusion: Thimerosal is present in contact lens solutions and cosmetics and most positive students who were unaware of their sensitization have used contact lenses for cosmetic purposes. This study should raise the alarm in using inert materials in contact lenses industry or at least warn females from the consequence of sensitization. Background: Sesame and perilla have been a Korean traditional crop and mainly consumed as seasonings or seed oil. However, sesame food allergy is an increasingly common problem in many countries. This study aimed at comparing protein pattern of sesame with that of perilla and analyzing the cross reactivity between sesame and perilla. Methods: Seeds were placed in 1:1 ethyl ether and extracted with slow stirring at 4-C for 2days in PBS (pH 7.4). To analyze protein patterns and specific IgE to sesame or perilla, crude extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and then performed with Western blotting using sera diagnosed as allergic to sesame or perilla. Sesame extract with various concentrations is pre-incubated with pooled sera before inhibition test, and then those sera were added to the ELISA plate pre-coated with perilla extract. Results: 1. Both sesame and perilla had the higher protein concentration and contained protein bands of 6 Y 82.2 kDa. However, after cooked, the proteins with high molecular weight disappeared and only 6 Y 14 kDa protein bands existed weakly. 2. The IgE binding bands were also detected at 6 Y 14 kDa in sesame and perilla by Western blot analysis. 3. In inhibition test, sesame showed low inhibition rate (G45%) against perilla by inhibition ELISA test. Conclusion: Sesame and perilla showed different protein pattern and low cross reactivity each other. It suggests that perilla can be the replacement of sesame in consumption. However, because they have the possibility of food allergy, the further study about their major allergens is needed.",

The protein band with m.w. of 20 kDa is largest and conform a protein group of Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (Hor.v1, CMb, BDR). The protein fraction of capsule of soybeans with m.w. 14 kDa conforming soybean profilin (Gly m 3) predominate natural soy, whereas that with m.w. 34 kDa conforming vacuolar protein (Gly m Bd 30 k) predominate GM soy.

A frequency of revealed IgE-Abs to soy was increasing from 20 % in infant patients to 57,8% in adolescent patients. The increased levels of IgE-and IgG-Abs to capsule of natural soybeans were determined most often. We revealed IgG-Abs to wide protein spectrum of whole natural and GM soybeans using western blotting, where the largest protein fraction had m.w. of 30 kDa. The soybean capsule is known to contain proteins, which are homologous to the major allergens of birch pollen (Bet v1); with this in view high frequency of revealed IgE-Abs to the capsule of natural soybeans is fully explained in the context of crossreactive antigens. While analyzing the blood serum of the patients with hypersensitivity to soy we revealed increased levels of IgE-Abs to birch pollen (81 % of cases) with high level of IgE-Abs found in 25% of patients. Therefore it was revealed that extracts of natural and GM soybeans contain proteins with identified allergic properties, which may cause the development of allergic diseases related to IgE-Abs and soy enteropathy related to IgG-Abs. Moreover, due to a pronounced homology with allergens of birch pollen, foodstuff containing soybeans may strengthen sensitization and intensify allergic reactions in Pollinosis patients.",

            "text": "Different proteomic approaches to the identification of wheat flour allergens Background: Food antigens penetrating into the gastrointestinal tract do not generally cause clinical symptoms, because most individuals acquire tolerance. However, some food components are recognized as the cause of adverse reactions in susceptible individuals. Wheat belongs among six major foods, which are responsible for approximately 90% of food allergic reactions in children. Although cereals are essential in the daily nutrition, only a few proteins have been identified as cereal allergens on the molecular level. Methods: To characterize wheat flour allergens, we prepared salt extract from seven of the most frequently used wheat cultivars and compared them by SDS PAGE. Proteins from the selected cultivar Sulamit were separated by 2dimensional gel electrophoresis , analyzed by immunoblotting and IgEreactive proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF, QTOF and LCQDECA nLC-MS/MS ion trap) and tested for the ability to activate patient`s basophils (expression of CD63 and CD203c markers was measured by flow cytometry). We developed ELISA to quantify patient`s IgE Abs reactive with defined allergens. Wheat extract was also treated with pepsin. Results: Patient sera can be divided into three groups: IgE Abs of the first one recognizes wheat components G30kDa, the second 930kDa and the third one reacts with components ranging from 6-170kDa. The pattern of wheat components recognized by IgE Abs was significantly influenced by conditions of protein separation and treatment with digestive enzymes. Using SDS PAGE, 2-DE, immunobloting and mass spectrometry we identified 19 potential wheat allergens. Employing newly developed ELISA, levels of IgE Abs against proteins from the Sulamit extract and one of the dominant wheat IgE binding component, \"-amylase inhibitors type 1 and 3, were quantified and shown to be significantly elevated in sera of allergic patients compared to those of healthy controls. Furthermore, the salt extract from the cultivar Sulamit as well as \"-amylase inhibitors were shown to by able induce significant activation of basophils of allergic patients. Conclusion: This study characterized the spectrum of wheat components recognized by IgE Abs of allergic patients, analyzed the impact of proteins separation and digestion on immunogenicity of wheat allergens, compared the sensitivity and specificity of newly developed specific IgE ELISA assay and in vitro basophils activation test using identified allergens.",

Influence of the soluble macroaggregates presence and other heatinduced changes on immunogenicity of the commercial milks is still a controversial issue. The aim of this study was to contribute to increase knowledge in this area. Methods: The kinetics of heat-induced precipitation of the main whey proteins $-lactoglobulin (\"-LG) and !-lactalbumin (!-LA) were examined in water solutions of individual proteins, in fresh milk, whey, and model mixtures of the both whey proteins with .-CN at 95-C during 30 min.",

Background: Limpet, a gastropod mollusc, is the second most common cause of IgE-mediated food allergy among adults attending our Clinical Immunology/Allergy clinic. The aim of this study is to characterize the putative allergen(s) and ascertain possible cross-reactivity with common inhalant and food allergens in our patients with limpet allergy. Methods: Consecutive adults presenting from 1 July 1994 to 31 April 2002 with immediate hypersensitivity following ingestion of limpet were studied. Sera stored at j70-C were assayed for specific IgE to common inhalant and food allergens. IgE western blotting and tandem mass spectrometric analysis were performed to identify the allergens. ELISA inhibition assays were carried out to compare the allergenicity of limpets with other gastropods, as well as to recombinant tropomyosin and arginine kinase allergens from dust mites and cockroaches. Results: There were 9 patients (6 males) and all were ethnically Chinese. Their mean age was 38 T 17 (19Y60) years. Eight patients had previously ingested limpet, with allergic reactions occurring during a median of 2 occasions. Six patients had history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and/or atopic eczema.

On invitro specific IgE assay, 77.8% were positive to shellfish mix, 77.8% to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 55.6% to Dermatophagoides farinae, 44.4% to Blomia tropicalis, and 33.3% to cockroach mix. Western blot and protein mass spectrometric analysis showed that the putative limpet allergens were a 37kD tropomyosin and a 40kD arginine kinase. ELISA inhibition studies using recombinant dust mite and cockroach tropomyosin as well as arginine kinase showed moderate cross reactivity between these allergens and the allergens from limpet. There was no significant inhibition of binding by abalone and clam. Conclusion: The putative limpet allergens in our patients are a 37kD tropomyosin and a 40kD arginine kinase, both of which are major allergens in other gastropods (abalone and pacific clam), crustaceans, American cockroach and house dust mite. Prior sensitisation to house dust mite and cockroach in our patients could have played a role in limpet food allergy. Surprisingly there was limited cross-reactivity with abalone and pacific clams, two closely related gastropod molluscs.",

Severe or fatal reactions seem to be rare, but the rate higher in children with peanut allergy. Lupine is a newly used legume in the human diet, which theoretically can give also cross reaction with soy and peanut. Aim of the study was to determine the cross reaction among soy protein, peanut and lupine. Methods: Immunoblot technique with SDS-PAGE protein separation and ELISA method. Polyclonal antibody and IgE soy positive human sera were used to detect reactions. Results: Immunological cross reactivity was demonstrated between the major allergens of studied legume proteins. The beta-conglycinin and their oligomeric subunits in soybean have shown cross reactivity with the Ara h1 in peanut and the 7S vicillin allergens in lupine. Furthermore it was observed an immunological cross reaction among the soybean glycinin allergens and the Ara h3 in the peanut and the vicillin 11S allergens in lupine, while the soybean profilin cross reacted with Ara h5 peanut allergen. The 2S allergens of prolamin superfamily in soybean as trypsin inhibitors and lectins shown cross reactive epitopes with Ara h2, Ara h6 and Ara h7 allergens in peanut. Soybean, peanut and lupine protein extracts did not differ in their IgE reactivity with soy positive human sera. Conclusion: Cross reactivity among the major allergens of soy, peanut and lupine was proved with human soy positive sera in vitro. Results draw attention to the possibility of anaphylaxis as a result of allergic cross reaction in patients with peanut and soy allergy. On this basis, it has to emphasise the need of precise labelling for food components to avoid the anaphylaxis.",

Background: Milk allergy is the most common IgE-mediated food allergy in early infancy. Cow`s milk contains about 25 proteins of which eight have been identified as allergens but there are varying results regarding the frequency of IgE recognition and the allergenic activity of the individual allergens. We developed a microarray for milk proteins which allows to determine indiviual patients' IgE reactivity profiles as well as the biological activity of the diseasecausing allergens using small amounts of patients' sera. Methods: We dotted different milk components including whole milk extracts, milk fractions as well as purified and recombinant milk allergens, and recombinant and synthetic fragments of milk allergens onto microarray and determined the IgE reactivity profiles of 78 milk allergic patients. In parallel, allergenic activity of the milk components was determined using rat basophil leukaemia (RBL) cells transfected with human Fc\u00e5 receptor that had been loaded with the very same sera.",

A high number of patients had IgE antibodies to sheep's and goat's milk, 82.1 % and 67.9%, respectively. But only 30.8% of the tested patients showed IgE reactivity to mare's milk. The most frequently recognized cow's milk allergens in our study were alphalactalbumin (62.8%), alpha-casein (48.7%), beta-lactoglobulin variant A and B (48.7 and 50.0%, respectively), and beta-casein (43.6%). Lactoferrin and BSA seemed to be of lesser importance since recognition frequencies were below 5 %. The most potent cell activating component in the humanized RBL assay was cow's milk which induced a relevant degranulation in 47.4% of the patients followed by goat's and sheep's milk (35.9 and 28.2%, respectively). Among the single components the caseins showed the highest biological activity (25 to 34.6% of the patients' sera). Conclusion: Using microarray technology in combination with data from basophil release assays it is possible to test simultaneously the frequency of IgE reactivity and the allergenic activity of a multitude of allergens using just a few drops of patient's serum. This test system will be important for diagnosis and therapy of cow's milk allergy.",

However, these modifications were shown to induce IgE mediated allergies in individuals usually tolerant to wheat. Leduc et al. (2003) published the first case of anaphylaxis after ingestion of a reconstituted meat containing a wheat isolate. Lauri\u00e8re et al. (2006) also showed that hydrolysed wheat proteins can induce severe allergic reactions by contact or ingestion. The objective of our work was to identify epitopes detected by IgE from patients with reactions to chemically deamidated gluten (product in which some glutamine residues were modified into glutamic acid). Methods: Sera from twelve patients with anaphylaxis, urticaria or WDEIA containing IgE antibodies to laboratory or industrial deamidated gluten in ELISA or RAST were analysed by pepscan with overlapping synthetic peptides. IgE-binding epitopes were searched among entire sequences of \u00e3 and w2-gliadins with identification of critical animo acid and analysis of effect of substitutions of glutamine into glutamic acid. Results: Eight sera reacted with repetitive peptides of \u00e3 or w2-gliadin containing a common octapeptide rich in proline and glutamine. Five critical positions for IgE binding have been identified on this epitope. Substitution of one of its glutamine into glutamic acid induced its recognition by two additional sera and simultaneous substitution of two glutamine into glutamic acid increased the intensity of responses obtained for the ten positive sera. Conclusion: Patients with reactions to deamidated gluten possessed IgE antibodies directed to linear sequences of the repetitive domains of \u00e3 and w2gliadins. IgE antibodies from most of the patient sera analysed in this study bound to an immunodominant epitope of 8 residues. Deamidation of two glutamines of this epitope increased significantly its recognition by patient IgE. This epitope is similar to a B epitope evidenced for celiac patients. These results show that some industrial treatments may increase the risk of allergy development.",

Objective: We investigated the usefulness of skin prick test (SPT) for the diagnosis of egg white (EW) CAPRAST-negative egg allergy infants and followed up the EW-CAPRAST in this study. Subjects and Methods: Data of negative SPT using Bifurcated needle (BF) were analyzed from the data of 202 infantile atopic dermatitis patients, who had received SPT from January in 2001 to April in 2005. From the analysis of SPT results, the average and standard deviation of negative value were obtained to set the range of positive SPT result. Among 202 cases, 89 suspected-egg allergy infants with negative IgE CAPRAST against EW at the time of first visit were recruited to this study to examine the usefulness of SPT. Positive conversion of EW-CAPRAST was checked in 78 cases (65: egg allergy+, 13: egg allergy-) who had been followed up in our outpatient clinic. Results: Range of negative SPT control value (mean+ 2SD) using BF among infants could be set as less than 2 mm for wheal and 5 mm for erythema. Among 89 suspected-egg allergy infants with negative EW-CAPRAST, 72 infants (80.9%) were diagnosed as egg allergy by the combination of elimination and provocation test, interestingly 39 infants (54.2%) showed positive SPT results in 72 egg allergies. In the follow up study of 78 negative EW-CAPRAST cases, 47 EW-CAPRAST out of 65 egg-allergy cases turned positive later infantile period (mean EW-CAPRAST: 9.6+/j16.7 Ua/ml at 9.9+/j5.6 months old). EW-CAPRAST of 7 cases in 13 non-egg allergies also turned positive in the follow up, however EW-CAPRAST titer was relatively lower compared to that of egg allergies (1.1+/j1.5 Ua/ml at 13.3+/j2.6 months old). Conclusion: We experienced fairly number of atopic infants with negative EW-CAPRAST at the first outpatient visit, who were later diagnosed as egg allergy. In about half of these cases, SPT was extremely useful for the diagnosis. In the follow up of egg-allergy infants, three quarter of EW-CAPRAST tuned positive around 10 months old. EW-CAPRAST of atopic infants without egg allergy also turned transiently and slightly positive. In the conclusions, SPT seemed to be more useful than EW-CAPRAST for the diagnosis of egg allergy in early infantile period, however provocation test may be required for the definitive diagnosis in suspected-egg allergy infants without any proof of egg-sensitization.",

The optical near-field phenomenon underlying the setup design of the sensor is called resonance-enhanced absorption (REA) utilizing gold nanoparticles as signal transducers in a sensitive interferometry-setup. Combined with visual readout that eliminates complex detection instrumentation, this assay system excellently meets the requirements of a rapid method for allergen detection and provides opportunities for the development of a miniaturised multiarray-sensor with improved sensitivity for allergy testing in clinical diagnosis. Methods: REA is observed when light-absorbing metal clusters are positioned at a nanodistance from a highly reflective mirror and illuminated with white light of the visible and near-infrared spectrum from the particle side. As a direct detection method based on distance-dependent light interference between the mirror and the resonantly excited metal clusters, a REA based capture assay has the power to link affinity binding with three-dimensional structural information. Results and Discussion: The immunochip biosensor showed concentrationdependent colour development by capturing biomolecule-functionalised gold nanoparticles on allergen or immunoglobulin coated chips. Semi-quantitative immunochemical responses are directly visible to the Fnaked`eye of the analyst with sensitivity comparable to common immunoassay procedures in microtitration plate format (ELISA). Unspecific background signals were minimized to the absolute target specificity of the antibodies and antisera used in the bioassay. We have applied this method to the detection of the egg white allergens ovalbumin and ovomucoid in complex food samples. To achieve improved interpretation and cross-validation relating to the immunochemical characterization of allergenic substances of processed food at the protein and peptide level, complementary investigation (in terms of applicability, reproducibility, and reliability of results) was carried out with alternative immunological methods (performed in ELISA and immunoblot format). In conclusion, the REA-based imunochip sensor is easy to fabricate, is reproducible in its performance, has minimal technical requirements, and will enable high-throughput screening of affinity binding interactions in technological and medical application for determining allergenicity.",

Background: New genetically modified (GM) organisms and novel processed food proteins are being introduced into commerce. Countries require safety assessments include a bioinformatics (sequence) comparison of the new protein to determine whether the new protein is a known allergen or is so similar to an allergen that currently allergic consumers would be at risk of reactions. If a match is found, the product would have to be tested using sera from appropriately allergic subjects. The quality of the database is a primary determinant of the search efficacy. A peer review process was used to update AllergenOnline and tools for an effective bioinformatics search are provided, free to the public. Methods: A list of 1758 Ballergens[ was compiled from NCBI using keyword searches, plus entries in the Allergen Nomenclature list of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) and AllergenOnline version 6. Sequences were grouped based on taxonomy and sequence identities. Peer reviewed articles were identified for each group. Criteria were developed to evaluate the evidence based on in vivo and in vitro tests using subjects with clinically defined, relevant allergic disease. Published data for each group was compiled and evaluated by primary and secondary reviewers, then the panel to remove groups with insufficient evidence of allergenicity (no IgE binding or in vivo reactivity, with subjects having at least minimal descriptions of allergies to the source of the protein). Free full-length and sliding 80 amino acid alignment tools are provided to allow public searches of the database. Key examples from the literature are used to illustrate the appropriate use of the database. Results: AllergenOnline version 7 contains 1251 sequences with published data demonstrating at least evidence of specific IgE binding using sera from subjects having some allergic symptoms when exposed to the source of the protein. Many isoforms are listed for some proteins. Others are represented by a single sequence. Bioinformatic comparisons with transgenic proteins from approved products and the literature were evaluated. No approved product exceeded Codex Guideline criteria, but some from the literature (presumably not in commerce) did, indicating a likely need for serum IgE testing. Conclusion: The curated allergen database will markedly improve the reliability of sequence matches for assessing the potential allergenicity of these new foods. Background: The quality of in vitro IgE tests used for food allergy diagnosis mainly depends on the analytes used. Usually total extracts of the suspected foods are used. However, in the recent past a rising number of studies about component resolved diagnosis have attracted rising interest. In many cases the use of purified single allergens either of natural origin or applied as a recombinant product has shown a superior performance when compared to total extracts. Within the EC funded IP Europrevall a library of 31 highly purified allergens from 10 foods listed in the new Labelling directive of the European Commission was established for developing novel diagnostics. Methods: Highly purified allergens either natural or recombinant from 10 foods (apple, peach, hazelnut, peanut, celery, cow`s milk, goat`s milk, hen`s egg, fish and shrimp) were characterized regarding their structural integrity, biological and allergenic activity. Protein mass was verified by mass spectrometry and sequence integrity by MALDI-TOF and N-terminal sequencing. Presence of isoforms in natural allergen preparations were identified by 2D Gel electrophoresis and secondary structure was evaluated by NMR maps of low molecular weight proteins. Allergenic activity was characterized using a panel of sera from food allergic patients. Results: Purification protocols for natural and recombinant allergens were established and quality assessment of the purified batches performed. Depending on either natural or recombinant origin different quality criteria were defined and met for inclusion into the allergen library. Structural integrity of the purified proteins was verified and IgE binding activity was assessed. Conclusion: This panel of well characterized allergens will be used to prove the concept of component resolved diagnosis and presents the necessary tools for setting up novel diagnostics. Using a significant number of allergic patients`sera across Europe it will contribute to identify relevant sensitization patterns and to improve dietary recommendations for the food allergic patient in the future.",

Methods: ELISA inhibition analysis using the sera of kiwi allergic patients was used for determination of immunological cross-reactivity between Act d 2 and other TLPs (thaumatin, zeamatin, Pru av 2 and Mal d 2). In order to identify putative cross-reactive epitopes virtual epitope mapping was applied. The similarities and differences in surface topology were compared. Results: ELISA inhibition assays for Act d 2 showed a high cross-reactivity with zeamatin, medium cross-reactivity with Pru av 2 and Mal d 2, and low cross-reactivity with thaumatin.

Preliminary efforts to purify natural Bet v1 homologues in sufficient quantities from kiwi failed so far. Methods: Two individual sequences (from green and gold kiwi fruit) homologous to Bet v 1 were identified from an EST cDNA library, subcloned into expression systems pETBlue-2 and pMW 175, respectively and expressed in E. coli. The resulting recombinant proteins were purified and characterized according to established methods. IgE binding activity of the purified recombinant Bet v 1 homologous proteins from kiwi fruit was tested by IgE-ELISA, IgE immunoblots, and inhibition assays. Results: Alignment of recombinant kiwi Bet v 1 homologues and recombinant Bet v 1a revealed an amino acid sequence identity of 50%. Well characterized purified recombinant Bet v 1 homologues from green (Actinidia deliciosa) and gold kiwi fruit (Actinidia chinensis) were recognized by birch pollen and kiwi sensitized patients in IgE immunoblots and ELISA experiments. The presence of a natural Bet v 1 homologous protein in green and gold kiwi fruit was confirmed by IgE immunoblot inhibition experiments using natural kiwi fruit extracts and immuno tissue prints. Cross-reactivity of the two recombinant proteins with varying intensities to natural Bet v 1 related protein from green kiwi and to rBet v 1a was demonstrated by ELISA and immunoblot inhibition assay. Conclusion: This is the first evidence of cross reactive Bet v 1 homologous allergens present in gold and green kiwi fruits. The present data point out that Bet v 1 homologues are relevant allergens in kiwi, especially for patients sensitized to tree pollen and kiwi fruits and might have been neglected so far due to low abundancy in the conventional extracts used for diagnosis.",

Medical University of Vienna, Department of Pathophysiology, Vienna, Austria. Background: The massive accumulation of sequence data of plant proteins in recent years has made the classification of allergens into protein families possible. By comparing sequences and structures, related proteins can be grouped together into families, and related families can be grouped together into superfamilies. This much broader picture now allows us to view allergenic proteins in their evolutionary context. Methods: Representative protein sequences were compiled by manually searching the Pfam database of protein families. Multiple sequence alignments and generation of neighbor-joining trees was performed using ClustalX. Phylogenetic trees were drawn with TreeView. Results: The cupin superfamily comprises numerous functionally highly diverse protein families from all groups of organisms including archaea. However, allergenicity within the cupins is confined to the vicilin and legumin plant seed storage proteins. The Bet v 1 superfamily contains the PR-10 family, the family of major latex proteins and ripening-related proteins, the norcoclaurine synthases, and the cytokinin-binding proteins. The PR-10 proteins from certain taxa such as the Fagales and Rosaceae are the only allergenic members of this superfamily. The divergence of the allergenic members of the Bet v 1 superfamily from the related major latex proteins, ripening related proteins and norcoclaurine synthases represents an ancient evolutionary event. Apparently the ancestors of modern day allergens were present long before any type of immune system had evolved. Conclusion: This study of the distribution of allergenic and non-allergenic members of protein families which was funded by the Austrian Science Fund grant SFB F01802 will provide new insights into the evolution of allergenicity and the factors that make proteins allergenic.",

            "text": "1 Phadia AB, R and D, Uppsala, Sweden; 2 MIAB, R and D, Uppsala, Sweden. Background: Allergy to fruits is often associated with pollinosis and is then often related to milder symptoms such as oral allergy syndrom (OAS). However, especially in warmer regions more severe symptoms are also common. Fruits are here more prevalent foods and are also often eaten in more sun-ripe forms. Allergy to fruits of the Rosaceae family is strongly associated with Bet v 1 in northern regions but in warmer regions allergic reactions to these fruits are more often related to lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) and sometimes also profilins. The aim with this study was to explore new extraction buffers and different parts of fruits trying to optimize extraction of labile Bet v1 analogues as well as more stable profilins, LTPs and other allergen components. Methods: Peach was selected as a model for Rosaceae fruits where Bet v 1 homologues, profilin and LTPs are important allergen components. Litchi was selected as a fruit where the exposure to the population in Europe is increasing with changing feeding habits and where profilin is suggested to be an important allergen. Extracts were produced using different buffers and procedures and different parts of the fruits (pulp/peel) were used. Samples from patients from different regions with different symptoms (from mild to severe reactions) were analysed using ImmunoCAP coupled with improved extracts as well as single components. IgE antibodies to components were also assayed with a microarray using only 30 6l of sample. Results: Optimal extraction performance was achieved by a cold extraction procedure containing polyvinylpyrrolidone. Both pulp and peel were needed for optimal performance. For selected samples, mainly reacting to Bet v1, increased results as measured with ImmunoCAP was seen in 76% (62/81) for Peach f95. In litchi profilin was the dominating allergen component in several patient samples both measured by ImmunoCAP and using the microarray assay. The results were confirmed by inhibition studies. Conclusion: Improved extraction methods can enhance the content of both Bet v 1 homologues and profilin in fruit extracts used for in vitro assays for specific IgE. Microarrays are useful tools to analyse component profiles in samples using very small volumes of sample. Profilin (Lit c1) is an important allergen in litchi and may cause severe reactions. In peach LTP (Pru p3) and the Bet v 1 homologue Pru p1 were the more important components in the tested patient population.",

The aim of the study was to determine serum concentrations of IL-4, IL-5 in patients with chronic gastritis and food allergy, who had been infected with H. pylori. The study was conducted on patients with atopic diathesis, suffering from dyspepsia and abdominal pain, who were monitored in our Outpatient Clinic for Food Allergy. The study group consisted of 71 patients, including 42 females aged 16=V54 years (mean age 35.5 years) and 29 males aged 18=V60 years (mean age 36.2 years). The control group was formed of 40 patients with dyspepsia and abdominal pain related to chronic gastritis and confirmed in endoscopy and histopathological investigation. specimens. The patients underwent endoscopy The samples were stained with eosin and hematoxylin (H and E) and with modified Giemza stain. Selected serum cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, nwere determined with ENDOGEN kits(Cambridge ). Serum levels of interleukin-4 in patients with food allergy ranged between 0.2 to 291 pg/ml, with mean value of 27.85=\u00d3 34.89 pg/ml. In the group of non-atopic patients with chronic gastritis, the range of determined values was 1.5 =V60.1 pg/ml =V mean concentration was 13.26=\u00d3 7.0 pg/ml. In control patients with functional dyspepsia, the concentration of IL-4 obtained ranged between 0 and 13.2 pg/ ml =V mean IL-4 concentration was4.31=\u00d3 2.8 pg/ml. IL-4 concentrations in various groups are presented in table 1. The concentrations of interleukin-5 in patients with food allergy ranged between 0 and 111.3 pg/ml (mean value 7.43=\u00d3 3.20 pg/ml). In control group of non-atopic subjects with chronic gastritis, IL-5 levels were 0=V20.6 pg/ml (mean level 4.03=\u00d3 1.60 pg/ml). The comparative analysis of IL-5 and IL5 levels between patients with food allergy and control group with chronic gastritis showed statistically significant differences (pG0.05). Conclusions: 1. Chronic exposure to the sensitising food in patients with food allergy results in the significant elevation of IL-4 and IL-5 levels. 2. Patients with food allergy and chronic gastritis, who had been infected with H. pylori manifest simultaneous increase in IL-4, IL-5, which suggests the participation of allergic factors in the pathogenesis of inflammation.",

Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the results of 175 singleblinded food challenges (SBFC) against hen's egg(HE) and cow's milk(CM) allergy patients. Methods: We analyzed the data of the patients who had received the SBFC in Sagamihara National Hospital from 1995 to 2005. The total numbers of examination was as follows; HE: 92 challenges (male: 65, female: 27, mean age: 72.6 months), CM; 83 challenges (male: 62, female: 21, mean age: 71.0 months). SBFC was performed using dried powder (4g of whole egg powder or 6g of CM powder) with 120g strawberry puree as vehicle and the test was carried out along the AAAAI office procedure manual (JACI 82: 986, 1988) . Results: Most of the subjects received the SBFC prior to the entrance of primary school whether or not they could take school lunch. The positive rate of challenge test was as follows; HE: 70/92 (76%), CM: 37/83 (45%). The most common symptom induced by HE challenge was GI reaction (83%), followed by skin reaction (69%) and lower respiratory symptoms (17%). We further confirmed challenges with heated hen's whole egg against 62 subjects in 70 diagnosed raw egg allergy patients. Interestingly a discrepancy of the result between raw egg challenge and heated egg challenge was seen. Twenty nine percentage (18/62) of raw egg allergy patients could take heated whole egg. Egg white specific IgE level of patients who could not pass the challenge (18.0UA/ml) was higher than that of those who passed (8.0UA/ml) (pG0.05). For CM challenge, skin reactions were the most common (89%), followed by lower respiratory symptom (65%) and GI reaction (19%). There was no statistical difference of CM specific IgE level between failed challenges (19.5UA/ml) and passed challenges (12.1UA/ml). Higher SPT positive reaction to CM and higher complication rate of bronchial asthma were recognized in failed cow's milk challenge group. Conclusion: SBFC for HE and CM was useful for the diagnosis at the time of entrance to primary school. To improve the quality of life of raw egg allergy patients, it is recommended for the patients to receive heated egg challenge. It seems that HE challenge test tended to induce GI reactions more than CM challenge and that persistent CM allergy may have something to do with the complication of bronchial asthma in school age children.",

How ever necrotizing enterocolitis resulting from cow`s milk protein allergy is rare. Case report: A 3,300 gm. full term female infant had been fed with cow`s milk formula since birth for ten days then switched to breast feeding alone. At twelfth day of life, she gradually developed abdominal distension and vomiting 2-3 times a day and was brought to see the pediatrician. Her physical examination had no other abnormal finding exept abdominal distension. So, she was advised to got some simethicone for abdominal discomfort and continued breast feeding. She still had the same symptoms that was vomiting and progressive abdominal distension. At twenty fourth day of life, she had developed more frequent vomiting, mucous bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal distension, hematochezia and pneumatosis intestinalis was seen on her X-ray finding. Laboratory finding included normal complete blood count, negative blood and stool culture. Necrotizing enterocolitis was diagnosed and successfully tolerated with parenteral antibiotics. She was placed on extensive hydrolysate formula which was well tolerated. The prick skin testing, atopy patch testing and radioallergosorbent testing were all negative for cow`s milk protein. Three months after, she grew very well with normal weight and height. She was challenged with soy-based formula at four month of age and well tolerated. At seventh month of age, she was challenged with cow`s milk protein and developed vomiting, abdominal distension within four days. The diagnosis of cow`s milk protein allergy was made based on positive symptoms after challenge.",

From January 2002 to May 2007, they were challenged with foods which seemed to have provoked allergic symptoms previously or which doctors advised not to take because of high scores of RAST tests and eliminated before the challenge. The clinical symptoms after ingestion of foods were observed for 3 days, documented and evaluated thereafter. Symptoms were classified into three categories; none, mild and moderate. Results: Foods challenged were egg white (61), egg yolk (58), cow milk (27), noodle (13), buckwheat (9), chicken (6), peanuts (5), soybean (4), tofu (3), mayonnaise (2) and others (30)(Figures in the parentheses are numbers of challenges). Positive and negative family history of allergic diseases was 84% and 16%, respectively. Symptoms after ingestion of foods were none in 78%, mild in 14% and moderate in 8%. No life-threatening symptom was noted. Specific IgE titers (RAST scores) against suspected foods were measured in 109 children. There was significant correlation between the symptoms and RAST scores (P$B!a(B0.017). On the other hand, 73% of high score cases (RAST score 5 and 6) were symptom free. These results show that there is discrepancy between Symptoms and RAST score titers. Conclusion: OFC is a simple and reliable method for clinical diagnosis of food allergy in children.",

Especially infants with cow's milk allergy were reported to have the reduced growth and special nutritional needs. Formulations of soy-based infant formula have changed over the years to improve digestibility, the stability and availability of minerals, and protein quality. soy-based formulas are a rich source of essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and \"-linolenic acid. This study was intended to investigate whether soy based formula has an effect on clinical symptom and the fatty acid composition in erythrocyte in infants with atopic dermatitis. The infants were recruited from pediatric allergic clinic in Hanyang University Guri hospital from September 2004 to August 2005. One group was supplemented soy based formula (SBF, n=21) and the other was supplemented hydrolyzed cow's milk as controls (HCM, n=20) for 12 weeks. The clinical severity was measured by using SCORAD index. To evaluate nutrition status of the subjects, anthropometric indices compared with Standard Value of Growth and Development for Korean children. Blood samples were collected to analyze fatty acid composition and immune parameters. Specific IgE measurement and Skin prick test was performed. The mean age of the SBF group was 9.0 T 2.1 month, and the HCM group was 8.8 T 1.9 month, and their SCORAD scores were mild or moderate states that significantly improved after experimental period (before SBF 40.9 T 2.4, after SBF 17.2 T 0.6, before HCM 45.7 T 24.6 after HCM 13.3 T 21.7). Although SBF grows consumed more \"-linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) intake, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were decreased after SBF. In the other hand, arachidonic acid (C20:4, n-6) was increased after SBF feeding (before SBF 8.3 T 2.8, after SBF 8.8 T 0.6), however, decreased after HCM (before HCM 8.6 T 1.0, after HCM 8.2 T 0.8). In conclusion, SBF supported to improve symptoms with normal growth and nutritional status in infants with atopic dermatitis but there were no evidences to improve fatty acid compositions although giving a number of l\u00e1-linolenic acid intakes. It might be suggested that %-6-desaturase was reported to decrease in atopic dermatitis, SBF could not show to recover this enzyme deficient condition in this study.",

Background: Our objectives were to describe the egg white proteins allergy survival time in our population and analyze the correlation between egg white IgE levels and oral contolled challenge test (OCCT) results. Methods: We performed a retrospective study including 42 patients diagnosed to egg allergy in the first 2 years of life who were controlled at 3,4 and 5 years of age. In the annual controls skin-prick tests, determination of egg white-specific IgE levels and OCCT were carried out until tolerance developed. In different moments of the follow-up we determined cut-off points of egg white-specific IgE levels that provided a probability Q 95 of egg white tolerance, analyzed by Receiver-Operating Caharacteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The median survival time of egg allergy was 48.7 months. The specific IgE levels cut-off points correlated with OCCT results differ in the different periods of follow-up. The egg white-specific IgE levels which were predictors of the clinical reactivity (positive predictive value (PPV) Q 95%) in the different periods were: between 25 and 36 months 1.52 kU/L, between 37 and 48 months 1.35 kU/L and between 49 and 60 months 2.59 kU/L. For these levels the negative predictive value (NPV) was 40%. Conclusion: The monitorization of egg white-specific IgE levels in allergic children to egg white allows us to predict the clinical reactivity along the egg allergy follow-up. Egg white-specific IgE levels greater than those referred would not be allow the OCCT in our population, while with lower levels we would find tolerant patients.",

Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Division of Pediatric Allergy/Immunology, Bangkok, Thailand. Background: Cow`s milk protein hypersensitivity is the most common food hypersensitivity in infants. The current diagnostic approaches include a thorough history taking, skin testing and measuring of serum specific IgE to suspected food, elimination of suspected food and food challenge test. Eosinophilia occurs frequently in premature infants and has been associated with total parenteral nutrition and with cow`s milk protein allergy, a response to foreign antigen presented to body through gastrointestinal tract, airway or intravenous routes. Methods: We reported a premature male infant, with gestational age of 33 weeks and birth-weight of 980 gram, who developed feeding intolerance to premature infant formula since 3 days old. He was treated as necrotizing enterocolitis and was stopped feeding for a few days which showed improving of the symptoms. Then he was started feeding again on 7 days old and had feeding intolerance with increasing of peripheral blood eosinophilia from 440 / mcL to 9,640 /mcL at the age of 26 days. Results: The allergy consultation was appreciated for evaluating the cause of hypereosinophilia. After thoroughly excluding other causes of eosinophilia, the patient was suspected to be allergic to cow`s milk protein. He was changed the feeding to extensively casein-hydrolysated formula. The specific IgE to cow`s milk was done and revealed a value of 7.77 kUA/L with total IgE of 114.3 IU/mL. His symptom of feeding intolerance was improved with a good weight-gaining. The peripheral blood eosinophilia was gradually decreased to 2,220 /mcL within 5 days. One week later, the infant was reintroduced feeding with cow`s milk protein formula for 3 days and developed vomiting, abdominal distension and retention of gastric contents with a striking peripheral blood eosinophilia to 16,592 /mcL. The feeding was changed back to extensively casein-hydrolysated formula and the symptoms of feeding intolerance were improved with decreasing of eosinophil count to 900 /mcL on the age of 60 days and body weight of 2,000 gram. Conclusion: Herein, we report a case of premature infant with feeding intolerance and hypereosinophilia resulted from cow`s milk protein hypersensitivity. Eosinophilia in premature infant may be one response to foreign antigen mediated through gastrointestinal tract resulted in food hypersensitivity.",

From one month of age, the patient was exclusively breast-fed. At 3 month of age, a supplement of CM-based formula was started on a pediatrician's recommendation, because of slight poor weight gain. After ingesting a CM-based formula, he developed visible rectal bleeding immediately. A presumed diagnosis of CM allergy was made and mother was instructed to stop CM-based formula and to avoid drinking CM. Because mucus blood mixed stool continued, he was admitted to our hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Physical examination showed he was no apparent abnormal findings. Stool culture was negative for routine pathogens. The number of eosinophil in stool smear was elevated. Serum IgE was 10 IU/ml and specific IgE for milk was positive. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to CM-based formula and breast milk were positive, but to an amino acid-based formula was negative. A skin prick test was positive for CM. Rectocolonoscopy up to the sigmoid colon was performed, showing macroscopic evidence of nodular lymphoid hyperplasia with small erosions in rectum. Histological examination of biopsy specimen revealed colitis with predominant eosinophil-infiltration in the lamina propria. Through these findings we considered that this is a case of CMA and that breast milk contained a small amount of CM. We asked mother to stop breast feeding and CM-based formula and started to an amino acid-based formula. After avoidance of breast feeding, resolution of hematochezia took place with in two days. At the age of 14 months, the patient grows well on an amino acid-based formula and food without CM protein.",

Background: Human breast milk is thought to protect the neonate from development of allergies. In particular, oligosaccharides in human milk may be beneficial. These prebiotics may have direct immunomodulatory capacities or exert their effects by enhancing growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. To test the effects of prebiotic oligosaccharides on allergic sensitization, a diet containing a 2% oligosaccharide mixture of fructo-, galacto-and acidic oligosaccharides (GOS:FOS (9:1, 1,8%) and AOS (0,2%)) was tested in mice orally sensitized against casein and whey proteins. The prebiotic mixture mimicks the oligosaccharide composition in human milk. Methods: For a period of 6 weeks, five week old female C3H-HeOuJ mice were sensitized weekly by gavage (i.g.) with casein or whey (20 mg), using cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvant. Mice were fed with the control or prebiotic (GFA) diet, starting two weeks prior to the first sensitization. At week 7 the mice were challenged subcutaneously (ear) (10 6g) and orally (100 mg). Serum levels of total IgE and allergen specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a were measured. The acute allergic skin reaction was determined by measuring ear swelling. Furthermore, isometric contraction of the colon was determined to get insight into motility changes of the intestine. Results: In the whey and casein sensitized animals the allergic skin reaction was significantly reduced in the prebiotic group. This was most obvious in the casein group (control vs GFA diet, 202 +/-23 vs 73 +/-11 6m; pG0.01). Casein and/or whey specific IgG1 and IgE levels were unaltered, while in whey sensitized animals IgG2a levels were enhanced by the diet (control vs GFA diet; 0.11+/-0.003 vs 0.40 +/-0.13 A450; pG0.05). The hypocontractility of the colon of casein sensitized mice was restored to normal levels by the prebiotic diet (control vs GFA diet, 1342 +/-404 to 3515 +/-1106 mg; pG0.05). Conclusion: A mixture of GOS/FOS/AOS oligosaccharides reduces systemic and local allergic symptoms in mice orally sensitized to cow`s milk proteins, when provided during the sensitization phase.",

Background: Animal models demonstrating IgE of the same specificity as human IgE and clinical symptoms upon challenge close to those observed in allergic patients are of great interest for the understanding of mechanisms involved in the induction and regulation of allergy. Food allergy to wheat (FAW) affects 0.1 to 0.4% of the global population. Major allergens have been characterized in this pathology. Water/salt soluble albumin/globulin fraction contains major allergens for children with the atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome (AEDS) and the insoluble w5-gliadins are involved in adults with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). Aim: The aim of this study consisted of developing a mouse model of food allergy to a gliadin extract, a wheat fraction containing major allergens by testing different protocols. Methods: Three strains of mice, Balb/c, C3H/HeJ and B10.A, were immunized by 4 successive intra-peritoneal injections of gliadin extract. The influence of the dose of gliadins (10 and 20 6g per mouse) was evaluated on allergen specific IgE and IgG1 production, on the cytokines production by activated T lymphocytes and on the elicitation of an allergic reaction. The development of the allergic reaction was compared by testing the Th2 type cytokine production and the eosinophil influx in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids 24h after a single intra-nasal stimulation with a total gliadin extract. Results: Balb/c mice demonstrated higher gliadin specific IgE and IgG1 productions than the other mice, whatever the dose administered (i.e. 10 or 20 6g). This was confirmed by the Th2 type cytokine profile produced by activated splenocytes. The significant eosinophil influx and the Th2 type cytokine produced in the BALs also showed the elicitation of the allergic reaction in Balb/c mice, whatever the sensitisation dose. Low to no elicitation was evidenced in B10.A and C3H/HeJ mice at the 10 6g dose. Conclusion: This study demonstrates for the first time the interest of Balb/c strain as a mouse model of food allergy to wheat. Our project is to further characterise the fine specificity of induced IgE and to compare the responses obtained in humans and mice.",

Children's Hospital, Department of Primary Child Care, Chongqing, China. Background: Few studies are available for treating food allergy by used TCMs. Objective: To investigate the effects of the Chinese herbal medicine Lonicera on the ovalbumin-induced hypersensitivity BALB/c mice. Methods: BALB/c mice sensitized with OVA were treated 4 hours after the first challenge and then twice daily for 10 days with different Lonicera concentrations extracted from water solution, i.e. 1g/ml as high dosage , 0.5g/ ml as middle, and 0.25g/ml as low. Results: Part I: The conditions of hypersensitivity mice were markedly improved by the high or middle Lonicera doses, such as reduced levels of serum OVA-specific IgE , inhibited the abnormal monocular cell proliferations, alleviated the degranulation and aggregation of intestinal mast cells, increased the percentage of intact mast cells and significantly reduction of histamine release, as well as downregulated the ratio of IL-4/IFN-, and promoted the mRNA expression of IL-10 and TGF-$ in PLNMC. Part II: The counts of Bifidobacterium and lactobacillus of the stool samples of the sensitized mice were significantly increased by the high or middle Lonicera doses, and meanwill the counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus were markedly declined. Conclusion: Our data first showed the immunological regulation effects to food allergy from the high or middle Lonicera concentrations extracted from water solution, such as anti-inflammation and immunoregulation of Th1/Th2 responses as well as activation of T regulatory cells. And the inbalance of intestinal microflora in OVA-induced allergic mice were improved by the Lonicera ext, which were helpful to improve the clinical manifestations of food allergy.",

Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Allergy and Immunology, New York, United States. Rationele: Polllen-apple allergy syndrome affects approximately 50% of birch tree pollen-allergic adults. Allergy to apple results from cross-reactivity between apple and birch pollen proteins. Subcutaneous immunotherapy with birch pollen was reported to improve apple allergy in a subset of adult subjects. Skin tests and serum allergen-specific IgE antibody levels correlate poorly with clinical expression of apple allergy in birch-allergic individuals. Oral food challenge to apple remains the most accurate diagnostic test, however, standardized protocol is not easily available and the procedure is labourintense. We sought to determine whether RBL passive sensitization assay might be used to evaluate effects of birch pollen immunotherapy in subjects with pollen-food allergy syndrome to apple. Methods: Birch-allergic individuals had apple allergy confirmed with doubleblind placebo-controlled oral food challenge and were randomized to birch pollen immunotherapy arm or to control arm (no immunotherapy, continued standard medical management). RBL-2H3 cells transfected with human Fc? receptor were passively sensitized with sera from birch-allergic individuals with oral allergy to apple at 1:40 dilution and following overnight incubation were stimulated with serial dilutions (10-2-10-8) of in-house freshly prepared raw Granny Smith apple extract. N-hexosaminidase content in the supernatant was used as a marker of RBL degranulation and was expressed as a percentage of total degranulation caused by Triton X. Results: Eight subjects completed birch immunotherapy course. Median baseline release was 2.6% (range; 1.2-19.5), not different from median postimmunotherapy release 4.7% (range; 1.3-20.5), p=0.9. There was a trend for decreased skin test responses to birch pollen extract (mean 13.1 mm preversus 10.3 mm post-immunotherapy; p= 0.21) and fresh apple (mean 4.4 mm pre-versus 3.3 mm post-immunotherapy; p=0.08). There was no significant difference between pre-and post immunotherapy birch IgE and Bet v 1 -IgE levels. Conclusion: RBL cells passively sensitized with sera from birch-and appleallergic individuals undergo degranulation upon stimulation with fresh Granny Smith apple extract. Mediator release to fresh apple extract is not different before and after birch pollen subcutaneous immunotherapy. The performance of the in vitro passive sensitization assay is affected by low concentration of major apple allergens in the extract.",

Patients had to indicate, on a Likert scale with multiple options (1: not at all; 5: very much), how much they were been troubled by each problem. Results: A relevant percentage of patients reported a important burden in many aspects of their life: Patients live in a state of alert: they are watchful to new symptoms? appearance (21 out of 27) and to what they eat (18/27), they are afraid to become sick when they eat something at risk (20/27) or a new foods (15/27). Patients refer to feel uneasy when they go out for dinner (12/27) and they are troubled because they have to read labels on every product (13/ 27). Another relevant problem is the diet that, due to avoiding the food, could be unbalanced (10/27). So food is a cause of concern for patients (14/27), and they can't enjoy food (10/27). Conclusion: on the basis of our preliminary data, food allergy appears as a problem that deeply interfere with patients life. The increased prevalence of latex allergy is associated with the increased usage of the latex materials and with the cross reactivity to latex and food allergens, due to the common determinants of the plants. Goal: to reveal the cross sensitization to the latex allergen in the patients with the food allergy using the test of allergic alteration of leucocytes (TAAL). Materials and Methods: 37 patients with the food allergy to fruit and 18 health care workers with glove-related skin symptoms (the itching, redness and dryness, sometimes an oedema, of the hand skin) were included in the study. The diagnosis of latex allergy in the patients of the second group was confirmed by the positive use test (in 10 from 10 ones), the negative results of Contact Patch Test with rubber chemicals for type IV hypersensitivity and by revealing of IgE antibodies to latex in 6 from 7 sera with ELISA method. TAAL and skin testing with latex and fruit allergens (carrot, potato, apple, tomato, kiwi, mango, melon, avocado, apricote, banana, perch -BStallergenes[, France) were performed in all patients. TAAL: 100 mkl of the each blood sample were incubated at 37oC during 30 min with 10 mkl of the standard solution of the ammoniated latex (Stallergenes), then micropreparates were prepared, stained with acrydine orange for luminescent microscopy and a percent of the alterated granulocytes was counted. The result was considered to be positive if the number of the alterated cells was more 10%. A sample of the same blood, incubated with 0.9% NaCl, was examined as a negative control. Results: the positive results of TAAL and skin test with a battery of fruit allergens were observed in the both groups of patients. In the latex allergy patients the positive results of the TAAL and skin test with latex allergen were observed in 77.8 and 83.3%, consequently. The positive results of the TAAL with the same allergen were observed in 70.5% of patients with the food allergy, and 76.4% of these patients had positive skin tests to the latex. The high percentage of the sensitization to latex in the food allergy patients without clinical symptoms to latex, established by two methods, may be the evidence of the cross reactivity and the risk for development of latex allergy.",

Fukuoka National Hospital, Pediatrics, Fukuoka, Japan. Rationale: The associations of latex and fruit oral allergy syndrome (OAS) with pollinosis have been reported in adult allergic patients. In childhood fruit allergy, however, no significant data had been collected on clinical features and frequency of cross-reacting IgE antibodies to latex. Latex antigen is clarified to hevein b1 to 13, and primary allergen to be related to clinical manifestation has been elucidated by IgE antibody determination for these recombinant hevein (rHev) b proteins. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the specific IgE antibodies to latex rHev b protein in fruit OAS children and latex allergy. Methods: Twenty-six atopic children (aged 2-11 years, 5.62.6 y.o.) with fruit OAS sensitized to latex and 3 latex allergy children (3-8 y.o.) with having operation history from early stage of age were enrolled in this study. Specific IgE Antibodies to food, pollen, latex, rHev b 5, 6.01, 6.02, 8, 11 were measured by CAP-FEIA (Phadia KK). Results: The clinical manifestations of fruit OAS were due to banana (67%), melon (63%) and kiwi (20%). With a fruit specific IgE antibody of 26 cases, banana 80%, melon 78%, kiwi 54% were positive. All patients had IgE antibodies to latex (0.6~31 UA/ml) and Japanese cedar pollen. In 6 fruit OAS with clear latex elicitation history, latex IgE antibody levels were high and IgE antibody to rHev b6.01 were positive in 3 cases and rHev b6.02 in 2 cases. In 14 of 20 cases without latex allergic provocative medical history, IgE antibody to rHev b 8 (profiln) increased remarkably. Specific IgE to rHev b 5, 6.02 and 6.01 were clearly positive in 3 cases of latex allergy with operation history. Conclusion: The results provide evidence that food allergy infants with fruit OAS have the risk of early sensitization to latex and pollen. Measurement of specific IgE to latex rHev b6.01 and 6.02 was useful as a prediction of latex anaphylaxis in fruits OAS children with latex IgE antibody.",

Phadia, R&D, Uppsala, Sweden. Aim: Peanuts are cultivated over almost the whole world. Despite the widespread consumption of peanut products, the prevalence of peanut allergy is varying between different areas. Peanut is, prior to consumption, subjected to different kind of processing in different parts of the world. In this study the effect of different treatments, on a variety of peanut cultivated in North and South America, trying to mimic different eating habits was investigated. Finally the IgE-binding patterns to untreated and roasted peanuts were studied in two different populations from US and Asia. Methods: Peanut source materials, Jumbo Runner, from US and Argentina were used. The peanuts were treated in three different ways; heated (90C, 20 min), boiled (20 min), or roasted (180C, 20 min) followed by grinding and extraction. Untreated peanut was used as control. The proteins were separated on both conventional SDS PAGE and 2D gel electrophoresis. Some spots from the 2D electrophoresis gel were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Immunoblotting analyzes were performed with sera from US and Asia from individuals with peanut sensitization. Results: Differences in protein patterns between the two source materials were detected on SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. One prominent protein band of approx 40 kD, in material from US was missing in the peanuts from Argentina. As expected a decrease in protein amount dependent on treatment and temperature was detected. Distinct spots in 2D electrophoresis at approx 60 kD from untreated materials, were not visible after roasting. These spots were identified as major peanut allergen Ara h 1 by MALDI-TOF MS. No obvious differences in IgE-binding in Immunoblotting between the two populations could be observed. For both populations there was a decrease in IgE-binding to roasted compared to untreated peanuts, especially at approx 60 kD (Ara h 1) and at 30-40 kD. Other differences in IgE-binding patterns were due to individual differences. Conclusion: Peanuts cultivated in different parts of the world may contain different proteins and allergens. Different treatment and cooking habits can influence the allergenicity. In this study no obvious differences in IgE-binding patterns between the two populations were observed even though the populations were chosen to reflect the different eating habits of peanuts. The clinical relevance of the missing protein in peanut source materials from Argentina need to be further investigated.",

We found that the atopic status and the outcome of IgE-mediated milk allergy.is significantly different compared to non IgE-mediated patients. This survey may help to understand many aspects of food allergy among children in Israel, and may help us provide appropriate guidance for the children and their families. Background: Teenagers are a high-risk group for food-hypersensitivity (FHS) fatalities and engage in risk-taking in managing their condition. Existing research has identified anxiety and impaired quality of life in children with FHS and their parents. To date, however, research has not addressed what the experience of living with FHS is like for teenagers. This study therefore aimed to describe the lived experiences of teenagers with FHS. Methods: Individual semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 UK teenagers (aged 13-18 years) with a pre-existing diagnosis of FHS. Participants were hypersensitive to a range of foods and experienced a variety of reactions. Participants were excluded if they had a concomitant non-allergic disease. Interviews explored the lives of the teenagers generally with particular attention paid to the experience of living with FHS. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and were then analysed using a phenomenological approach. Results: Four main themes were identified: FHS as a way of life, managing FHS as an assessment of acceptable risk versus acceptable burden, living with FHS as coping with necessary burden, and alleviation/exacerbation of the burden of living with FHS. For participants the process of managing FHS was not described as problematic but as a way of life. Managing FHS was described as negotiable rather than prescriptive and was based on an assessment of acceptable risk versus acceptable burden. Negotiating management did not however completely relieve the burden felt and participants felt that a necessary part of living with FHS was coping with necessary burden and a variety of coping strategies were employed to this effect. Participants also described ways in which the burden of living with FHS is alleviated or exacerbated both by them personally and by others whose behaviour affects their life with FHS. Conclusion: The themes provide some explanations for why teenagers with FHS engage in risky behaviours and describe how teenagers cope with managing FHS and what factors make living with FHS easier or more difficult. The themes indicate ways in which the lives of teenagers with FHS can be improved and therefore provide new information about living with FHS from the perspective of teenagers that will be of use to healthcare practitioners working with teenagers with FHS.",

It has an excellent one I foretell since most of the cases they are solved from the 4 years of age. The associated clinical disorders to the allergy to cow milk in these children include atoepics conditions such as atoepics dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma and other manifestations corresponding to foods allergies. Objective: To determine the association of allergy to cow milk and persistent allergic rhinitis in smaller children of 4 years. Material and Method: 5 smaller children of 4 years with diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and allergy to cow milk through Clinical History evaluated themselves. They were made Prick Test with cow milk standardized protein extracts (Casein, A-lactoglobulin and Blactoglobulin); Concentrated of Histamina 1mg/ml considering as positive control the one presence papula of 5 mm, and saline solution as negative control without presence of p\u00e1pula.

Background: IgE-mediated food allergy is the most common type of adverse reaction to food in infants and young children. It presents with a wide spectrum of clinical reactions including life-threatening allergic symptoms. The study has been performed to determine the most prevalent food allergens inducing immediate clinical reactions in different age groups of Swiss infants and children. Furthermore we investigated if there are specific patterns of allergic reactions to individual food allergens. Methods: Prospective analysis of patients referred from 2004-2006 for assessment of immediate type allergic reaction to food. The study has been carried out at the Food Allergy Clinic of the Children's Hospitals Aarau and Lucerne. Individuals presenting with atopic dermatitis and evidence of delayed reaction to food were not included. Diagnosis of food allergy was based on clinical history, skin Prick tests (with commercial extracts), Prick-to-Prick testing using native food and determination of specific IgE antibodies to food proteins by CAP-FEIA system. Food challenges were performed in patients without history of life-threatening anaphylaxis when the causative antigen could not be conclusively determined. Results: 278 food allergies were identified in 151 children (67% male, 33% female) with a median age of 1.9 years (range 3 months -15 years). Overall, the most prevalent food allergen is hen's egg (23.7%), followed by cow's milk (20.1%), peanut (14.0%), hazelnut (10.4%), wheat (6.1%), fish (4.3%), kiwi and soy (2.2% each) . In infancy, the most common food allergens are cow's milk, hen's egg and wheat. In the second and third year of life, hen's egg, cow's milk and peanut are predominant whereas above the age of 3 years, peanut, hen's egg and fish are the most prevalent. Urticaria is the most frequent reaction to food allergens. However, beyond urticaria, there are different patterns of clinical reactions to individual food. Cow's milk and hen's egg allergies are mainly presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Peanut and hazelnut with angioedema. Fish with both angioedema and anaphylaxis and wheat with both angioedema and asthma. Conclusion: 8 allergens account for 83% of IgE-mediated food allergies in Swiss infants and children.

Kharkiv State Medical University, Propedeutic Pediatria Department N2, Kharkiv, Ukraine. Background: A food allergy affects the considerable quantity of children because of their gastrointestinal tract immaturity and low immunologic tolerance. According to the recent data of investigations from 1/3 to 1/2 children with an atopic dermatitis have a food sensitization. But the food sensitization is different in different countries because of the national food tradition and genetic factors. For example, there are not allergy reactions for peanuts and shellfishes in Ukraine but they are characteristic for American countries. From other hand, some food has changed its allergic properties. For example, all over the world it is marked increasing allergy to soy. Objective: To find out peculiarities of a food sensitization for early aged and late school aged children with atopic dermatitis in Ukraine. Methods: Sixty seven patients with atopic dermatitis were observed. The patients were divided into two groups: the first one (28 patients) aged from 3 month to 3 year and the second one (39 children) aged 12-18 year. The food sensitization was determined by the enzyme immunoassay method for the measurements of the level of allergen specific human IgEantibodies in the blood for the first group and by a skin prick testing for the second group. Results: The food sensitization was revealed in 92,9% and 71,8% patients of the first and the second group accordingly, including the high and very high reactions for 92,9% and 21,4%, monoallergy for 7,1% and 5,1% children accordingly. The high and very high levels of specific IgE were detected for antigens of a corn (42,3 %), a chicken egg protein (39,3 %), a fish (30,8 %), a rye (28,6 %), a chicken egg (26,9 %), oats (25 %), a cow's milk (23,1 %), a chicken egg yolk (21,4 %), rice (21,4 %), a tangerine (21,4 %), a lemon (21,4 %), and an orange (21,4 %) in children of the early age. The food tolerances for a corn, a rye, a cow's milk, oats, rice, a chicken egg protein, a tangerine are formed to late childhood. Certain types of food are more likely than others to be allergen for children of late school period: a chocolate (70 %), a tomato (26,3 %), a pear (23,3 %), a carrot (20,6 %), a potato (20,5 %). Nobody from 24 examined patients has sensitization to peanuts. Conclusion: The established peculiarities of a food sensitization should be taken into account at initial preventive maintenance of atopi, and also they should be used for prescription of the empirical hypoallergic diet in Ukraine and the East Europe.",

Background: Fish has been reported to be one of the most important allergenic foods causing severe allergic reactions. Furthermore, parvalbumin, a small calcium-binding protein, and collagen have been identified as important cross-reactive allergens in fish. Objective: To clarify the clinical and laboratory features of allergy to fish and to detect the cross-reactive allergens by ELISA in Japanese patients. Methods: Six patients with suspected hypersensitivity to fish were subjected to skin prick tests and measurement of specific IgE antibody to fish. Additionally, specific IgE against purified parvalbumin and collagen were investigated by ELISA. Results: The patients'(1 male, 5 females) age ranged from 8 months to 22 years. All of them also had other atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma and pollinosis. The diagnosis based on symptoms after fish ingestion and results of skin prick tests, was anaphylaxis and oral allergy syndrome (OAS) accompanied with symptoms other than oropharyngeal symptoms in 2 and 4 patients, respectively.

When infant rats were immunized with cow's milk proteins in turn, serum concentration of anti-casein IgG was lower in Minfants than in E-infants. Thus, the immune tolerance against food proteins was acquired via breastfeeding from mothers fed the food containing the relevant proteins. The acquired tolerance against ovomucoid diminished spontaneously after weaning while the infants did not feed egg white proteins. Similar immune tolerance via breastfeeding were also observed in BALB/c mice.",

Background: Basic treatment for food allergy has been to avoid the offending item, to date. This approach is difficult in the case of common foods, and where there is a risk of severe reaction, due to child's and child's family concern of consuming the offending food, even inadvertently. In this study preliminary data regarding 3 children allergic to hen's egg (HE) orally desensitised with increasing doses of this food, are shown. Objective: To desensitise children with severe IgE-mediated HE allergy in a period of 6 months by introducing increasing daily doses of HE in order to enable the child to assume 25 ml of HE daily (corresponding to 3.2 protein grams), or to induce tolerance of the highest possible HE dose. Study Design: These are preliminary data of a larger study concerning children at least 6 years old with severe IgE-mediated HE allergy. A positive DBPCFC with HE confirmed the diagnosis. Oral desensitisation was done with increasing doses starting from 0.06 mg of HE proteins. Specific IgE to HE were evaluated through allergenic molecule-based approach with a proteomic technology (VBC Genomics microArray). Results: The 3 children achieved the daily intake of 25 ml of HE during a 7 month mean period. During this period a reduction of IgE values (kUA/L) for Gal d 1 (Ovomucoid) was observed in all cases (in one case with negative result after desensitization). No significative differences were seen comparing the result for Gal d 2 (Ovalbumin), Gal d 3 (Conalbumin) and Gal d 4 (Lysozim)(see table) . Conclusion: We successfully desensitised 3/3 children with IgE-mediated HE allergy in a mean period of 7 months. Moreover, we dramatically reduced the risk of severe reactions after accidental or unnoticed introduction of low quantities of HE. We observed a parallel reduction of specific HE IgE against Gal d 1. We do not propose generalizing this method beyond trained staff.",

University of Genoa, Allergy and Respiratory Diseases, Genoa, Italy. Background: IgE-mediated food allergy is an important cause of anaphylaxis, approximately 6% of young children and 3.7% of adults have a food allergy. The most frequent finding in food allergic patients are: peanuts, tree nuts, milk, egg, crustaceans and fish. Case Reports: We report the cases of two young women referred to our department from emergency room for food induced anaphylaxis. The first case occurred in a 42 year-old woman after few minutes from eating lupins, with the development of cyanosis, inspiratory dyspnoea and sudden lack of consciousness. She was immediately treated with epinephrine and systemic steroids with remission of symptoms. The second case occurred to a 30 year-old woman showing anxiety, general itching, urticaria, vomit, facial angioedema, hypotension and syncope after ten minutes from assumption of gluten free cookies (patient was not celiac). The sudden administration of systemic steroids and antihistamines induced patient's recovery. Both patients underwent prick test for inhalant allergens showing positivity only in the second patient for dermatophagoides, birch, parietaria and grass pollens. No positivity was observed for common food allergens mentioned above. The two patients showed marked positivity to the prick-prick test with lupin. A deep analysis of cookies-label showed the presence of lupin flour. Previous reports described the sensitivity to lupin most of all in patients with professional exposition to this legume flour. In our case reports no specific risk factors to lupin allergy nor particular predisposition to food allergens sensitisation were evident. Discussion: Lupin products are gradually being introduced into more and more foods including beverages, bread, biscuits and pasta as an additive to wheat flour substitutive of soy flour often present in food for people affected by celiac disease. In this contest allergy to lupin may be considered as an emerging condition, related to the hidden presence of this allergen or contamination, potentially dangerous for celiac patients.",

Fukuoka National Hospital, Pediatrics, Fukuoka City, Japan. Background: Food-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis (FDEIAn) is a severe systemic syndrome induced by physical exercise after food ingestion. In recent years there has been an increasing number of reports of FDEIAn, but the actual situation is not known well. Objective: To investigate the symptom of FDEIAn and grasp the actual situation of provocation test we investigated about 19 cases that was doubted FDEIAn, and were admitted for the purpose of detailed examination for the last eight years. Methods: Nineteen children (16 boys and 3 girls) 19 cases were enrolled in this study. Age at onset was from 8 to 16 years old (average age 11 years old). IgE was measured by CAP-FEIA (Pharmacia) and skin prick test was examined in need. Provocation test by combination of food and exercise test was performed for 18 patients and 4 of them with preadministration of aspirin. Results: As for the symptom at the onset, facialangioedema or blepharedema was present in 12 cases and urticaria in 10 cases, respiratory symptom in 13 cases ,hypotension in 5 cases, unconsciousness in 4 cases. Intramuscular epinephrine injection was medicated for 4 cases. The causative food allergen was as followed, wheat in 8 cases, crustacea in 7 cases, vegetables / cone / milk / cheese for each 1 case, unknown in 4 cases. We could be able to estimate food antigen by medical history in 17 cases. Related food specific IgE was positive in 5 of them. Twelve cases were negative CAP-RAST ,and 8 of them showed positive SPT. Two cases were not be able to estimate antigen by medical history and negative CAP-RAST. And one of them showed positive SPT. Four cases in 15 were positive by provocation tests with combined foods and exercise. We performed administration of aspirin before ingestion of food and exercise for 4 examples, symptom was provocated in only one case. Conclusion: Wheat or Crustacea was a major food allergen of FDEIAn, but few case were caused by vegetables or fruit. Combination of CAP-RAST and skin prick test was useful to specify the allergen. In our cases, a positive rate was 50% by combination of food and exercise test or with preadministration of aspirin. It is need to establish about laboratory methods on children with FDEIAn such as food loading dose, exercise methods, and premedication of aspirin in future.",

Objective: The dietary life of children with food allergy (FA) is restricted very much, and their quality of life (QOL) of diet would be affected. Therefore we have to perform dietary management for such children, but we have not yet known how they are restricted in their dietary life. We conducted current study to clarify the problems of dietary life in children with FA in our outpatient clinic. Methods: By questionnaire we examined QOL of diet (burden of the dietary life at home and outside, problems of nourishment, and parents' psychological burden) against the parents of children with FA or without FA (control group). In addition, only to parents of children with FA, we interviewed to qualify the troubles they had in the dietary life just after the diagnosis of FA and at the some time after starting elimination diet. Results: A total of 544 patients was surveyed. In the QOL survey, 40.1% of the children with FA had different menu from the family's menu, whereas only 21.7% of the control subjects did. In addition, 69.0% of parents of children with FA had difficulty in making menu, and 96.8% of the parents paid attention to food labeling, and 40.1% of those felt an economic burden for purchasing foods for FA children. Furthermore, 54.1% of the children with FA were not satisfied with eating-out, whereas only 35.4% of control was not satisfied. Children with FA were satisfied with the quality of school lunch by 71.9% but 95.4% for control. The most prominent problem just after the diagnosis of FA was about Bmaking menu / cooking[ in all age group. It was also a problem for the mothers to wean FA babies during infancy. However, a tendency to diversify troubles by age was recognized after starting elimination diet, such as problems concerning Bpurchase foods and eating-out[, or Bschool lunch[. Conclusion: The study revealed that children with FA were restricted in terms of the dietary life, and that their QOL was deteriorated compared with control group. Since we could obtain information of the dietetics of which children with FA and their parents desired, it is important to pursue appropriate dietary management for the children with FA.",

Background: Balb/c mice, when sensitized epicutaneously with ovalbumin, had increased serum ovalbumin-specific IgE as well as IgG1. After repeated intragastric challenges (ig) with ovalbumin, mice developed acute diarrhea within 60 min of the 6. ig dose, whereas there was no diarrhea nor increased IgE or IgG1 in the control groups. Since the role of small intestinal mast cells was undisputable in this model, we wanted to evaluate the effect of imatinib on these cells. Imatinib (GlivecR) is a potent inhibitor of the most important growth factor receptor of mast cells, the c-kit. Methods: Imatinib (100 mg/mouse) was given orally to Balb/c female mice (20-25 g) as a pre-treatment during each 4 sensitizations and every second day from the day 39 at the same time with the 10 ig ovalbumin (50 mg/mouse) challenges. Ovalbumin-specific IgE, IgG2A, and mucosal mast cell protease 1 (MMCP-1) were measured from the serum and histamine from the plasma with standard ELISA methods. Rectal temperatures were measured and diarrhea evaluated before and after the 6.-10. ig challenge of ovalbumin. Chloroacetate esterase (CAE) was used for general mast cell staining, for immunohistochemical staining MMCP-1 antibody was used. For double staining fluorescent method with MMCP-1 antibody and TUNEL methods were used. The total amount of stained cells was calculated from the whole crosssectional specimens of duodenum. Results: There were no significant differences in the levels of ovalbuminspecific IgE or IgG1 between the imatinib-treated and the vehicle treated ovalbumin-sensitized mice indicating that the treatment did not prevent the sensitization of the mice. The serum MMCP-1 levels at the sacrification were lower in the imatinib-treated mice than in the vehicle treated group (10100 T 10967 and 14173 T 11246 ng/ml, respectively). Imatinib decreased the number of CAE+ cells (59 T 32 and 126 T 53 cells/mm 2 , p G 0.05) and MMCP-1+ cells (13 T 15 and 65 T 47 cells/mm 2 ), respectively. The combined MMCP-1 and TUNEL staining indicated that the duodenal mast cells did not go into apoptosis during the treatment. Conclusion: Imatinib treatment indicates the important role of the intestinal mast cell population, CAE+ and MMCP-1+ cells, of which MMCP-1+ cells seems to represent the majority of intestinal mast cells in the mouse food allergy model. Identification and immunochemical characterization of a common allergenic pollen Cycas circinalis Kashinath Bhattacharya. Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan, Botany, Santiniketan, India. Objective: Cycas circinalis is a common garden plant. The pollen grains of Cycas circinalis are airborne and remain suspended in the air from May to June with a peak concentration at the end of June. The allergenicity of the pollen grains is very common among the local inhabitants, but has not been reported so far. Materials and Methods: The pollen extract showed high (25.6%) skin reaction on 172 respiratory allergic patients. Sera from the subjects were tested directly by ELISA for estimating the allergen specific IgE. The results were expressed as P to N value (ratio of patient's sera in respect to normal one). The allergic fraction was separated in 12% SDS-PAGE. Results: The results showed the presence of 14 components in the range between 14-100 kDa. Sera of eight patients showing P to N value greater than 3.5 were used for immunoblotting to identify the specific IgE binding protein.",

Background: The determination of cross-reactive IgE epitopes on allergens is a major challenge. Mapping of discontinuous (=structural) IgE epitopes by experimental methods is extremely time consuming and possible for only few allergens and epitopes. Most structural methods for epitope determination (e.g., co-crystallization of Allergen-Fab complexes, NMR-based hydrogen exchange or MS-based methods) work only with monoclonal antibodies and therefore epitopes can only be determined one at the time and never represent the polyclonal situation found in reality. The mapping of allergen specific sequence motives onto the surface has been used or prediction of putative epitopes. However, sequence homology (alone) may be a weak predictor for cross-reactivity, as structural conservation is bound to be a major determinant of cross-reactivity.",

G\u00f6teborg University, Department of Internal Medicine, Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. Background: Exosomes are vesicles of endocytic origin produced by many cell types and released in the extracellular environment as 30?100 nm large membrane vesicles. Exosomes are involved in different signalling events including antigen presentation to T-cells and development of tolerance. It has recently been shown that mast cell exosomes contain a substantial amount of functional RNA (Valdi et al., Nat Cell Biol 2007) . The aim of this study was to investigate weather exosomes in human blood plasma contain RNA and/or DNA. Methods: Peripheral blood plasma was derived from healthy blood donors and exosomes were isolated by a series of ultracentrifugations and filtrations. Purified exosomes were attached to anti-MCH class II coated dynabeads and analysed using FACS. The tetraspanins CD 63, CD 9 and CD81, known to be enriched in exosomes, were used as markers for exosome detection. We also performed electron microscopy (EM) to detect exosomes in the sample. RNA was precipitated using Trizol\u00db according to the manufacturer?s protocol. To magnify the signal, the RNA was then converted to DNA using a random primer, and separated by agarose gel. We also confirmed the presence of mRNA in exosomes by using oligo d(t) primers for conversion of mRNA to cDNA. Results: The isolated vesicles from plasma were identified as exosomes by both EM and flow cytometric analysis (FACS). The results from the EM showed exosomal structures with a size of 30?100 nm in diameter. The FACS analysis showed the presence of MHC II, CD63, CD9 and CD81, all markers of exosomes. The exosomes also proved to contain significant amounts of RNA, but no DNA. Some of the exosomal RNA was identified as mRNA. Conclusion: Our results show the presence of RNA-containing exosomes in human plasma. Since exosomes have the ability to fuse with cells and deliver their RNA to that cell, it is possible that the RNA in plasma exosomes constitute a genetic signal between cells at a distance. Background: Allergic airway diseases are characterized by inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. There is evidence that, in the upper airways, hyperresponsiveness can be attributed to increased neural activity. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a neurotrophin that has been shown to be an important mediator of neural responsiveness in the airways of bronchial asthma patients. Recent studies suggest that NGF may also be an important inflammatory mediator. Therefore, NGF could be a link between allergic inflammation and neural responsiveness However, expression of NGF has not been reported in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients. This study was performed to investigate the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) messenger RNA and protein and to localize the NGF protein in the nasal mucosa of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and control subjects. Methods: Inferior turbinate mucosa samples were obtained from 20 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and 20 matched non-allergic patients. NGF messenger RNA was extracted from the inferior turbinate mucosae, and then reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed. Western blotting was used to analyze differences in expression levels of NGF protein between patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and normal controls, and the NGF protein was localized immunohistochemically. Results: The expression levels of NGF messenger RNA and protein in the nasal mucosa were significantly increased in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis compared with those in controls. NGF protein was expressed in the epithelium, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and submucosal glands. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of NGF expression in the human nasal mucosa and its increased expression in perennial allergic rhinitis. These results suggest that NGF may contribute to the pathogenesis of perennial allergic rhinitis.",

Background: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is the most predominant house dust mite (HDM) species and the most important source of indoor allergens in Thailand. Currently, there is no subunit vaccine available for successful prevention of the allergy to HDM. Characterizations of all potential HDM allergens that cause IgE production in the allergic patients are needed for development of a proper vaccine. The present study was therefore conducted to globally identify potential allergens from D. pteronyssinus using a proteomics approach. Methods: Proteins derived from D. pteronyssinus cells were resolved by twodimensional gel electrophoresis , transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using pooled HDMsensitive patients' sera (n = 39) or pooled normal control sera (n = 5) as the source of primary antibody. The membrane was then probed with mouse antihuman IgE (\"-chain specific) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and immunoreactive proteins were then visualized using a chemiluminescence substrate. The corresponding spots in another parallel 2-DE gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue that matched to these immunoreactive spots were excised and identified by quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and/or tandem MS (MS/MS). Results: A total of 33 immunoreactive spots were observed using the pooled patients'sera, whereas none was detected with the pooled control sera. Among these, 23 were successfully identified by Q-TOF MS and/or MS/MS analyses, including Der p 1, Der p 2, Der p 8, Der p 14 and other proteins that had not previously been recognized as the HDM allergens.",

Immunochem., Tokyo, Japan. Background: Quantification of human IgE (hIgE) in the patients' sera is important for the diagnosis of allergy. Most of conventional assay methods of hIgE depend on the binding of anti-hIgE antibody and hIgE in the sera. However, the hIgE concentration in the sera quantified by such methods is not necessarily correlated to the activation of mast cells. One possible reason is anti-hIgE autoantibody in the sera, which may interfere binding of hIgE to high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc(RI). Therefore, it is important to develop a new method which can detect hIgE actually contributed to the sensitization of mast cells. In this study, we have tried to establish new quantification method of surface-bound hIgE using chimeric receptor bearing the extracellular region of Fc(RI \" subunit and intracellular region of EGF receptor (EGFR). Methods: The cDNAs encoding chimeric receptors with or without intracellular EGFR region were made by fusing cDNAs of Fc(RI\" and EGFR based on PCR. The transmembrane domains of the chimeric receptors were from those of both receptors. The cDNAs were inserted to a mammalian expression vector, and the plasmids were transfected to HLR-Elk1 cells, which are HeLa cell-derived cell line containing Elk1-transactivable luciferase gene. The expression of the chimeric receptors were determined by confocal microscopy and Western blotting. The phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules induced by hIgE sensitization and crosslinking with anti-hIgE was investigated by Western blotting. The crosslinking of the chimeric receptors were measured by luciferase activity. Results: Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that the chimeric receptors with transmenbrane domain of EGFR were efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane of HLR-Elk1 cells, however, those of Fc(RI\" were less expressed on the cell. Addition of hIgE to the chimeric receptor-expressing HLR-Elk1 cells caused significant phosphorylation of the chimeric receptor and MAPK, and the phosphorylation was increased when anti-hIgE was applied. However, crosslinking of hIgE with anti-hIgE did not augment luciferase expression induced by hIgE addition. Conclusion: The cells expressing Fc(RI-EGFR chimeric receptors could be a useful diagnostic tool that detects binding of hIgE to the cell surface Fc(RI. However, a new method to detect crosslinking of Fc(RI should be developed.",

Background: Along with the identification of a large number of allergenic proteins from diverse sources, it has become clear that most allergens belong to a limited set of protein families. Most currently available allergen databases such as the official list of allergens (www.allergen.org) group allergens mainly by source organisms and do not take into account evolutionary relationships among allergens. Hence, we established AllFam, a database of protein families of allergens. Methods: Allergen data were downloaded from the Allergome (www.allergome. org) database. Protein sequences from the Uniprot (www.expasy.uniprot.org) database were compared to protein family definitions from the Pfam (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam). The AllFam database combines these protein family data with exposure and source data from the Allergome. AllFam contains a fact sheet for each allergen family with information on biochemical properties and allergological significance. Results: The Allergome database contained 831 allergen sequences not including isoallergens. The sequences were classified into 182 protein families. However, only 94 families contained more than one allergen. The most abundant allergen families were the prolamin superfamily that comprised several subfamilies, and the profilins, a ubiquitous group of cross-reactive plant allergens. The family of EF hand containing calcium-binding proteins included polcalcins from pollen and parvalbumins from fish and amphibians. Allergenic tropomyosins were found as food allergens in crustaceans and molluscs and as inhalative allergens in mites and cockroaches. A classification of allergens by source revealed a similar number of protein families among plant and animal allergens (72 and 79 families) and a considerably lower number of fungal allergen families (50). Grouping of allergens by route of exposure showed that the distribution of food allergens is biased towards a few abundant protein families. The database contained 64 families of food allergens with the seven most abundant families accounting for 55% of all allergens. In contrast, there are 125 families of inhalative allergens with the first seven families making up only 27% of all allergens. Background: Aspergillus species are ubiquitous saprophytic fungi that cause a variety of diseases, ranging from hypersensitivity reactions to flu-like pneumonia and life-threatening invasive aspergillosis. As the lung is the primary site of initial infection with airborne conidia, we investigated the innate immune responses of bronchial epithelial cells against different forms of Aspergillus. Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells were treated with equal numbers of killed spores or germ tubes of either Aspergillus fumigatus or Aspergillus flavus. Transcriptional activation of the cytokine genes in the presence of germ tubes or spores was determined using real-time PCR analysis. Secreted cytokines following treatment with the mentioned fungi were also measured by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay. Results: Analysis by real-time PCR showed that inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-6 as well as the proinflammatory protease, caspase-5 were strongly upregulated by both treatments in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, germ tubes induced a stronger response than spores. TNF-\" and $-2-defensin were induced by high a concentration of germ tubes, but not by spores. Furthermore, IL1 pretreatment highly induced the expression of $-2-defensin, IL8 and IL12. Conclusion: Taken together, our results show that germ tubes of Aspergillus fumigatus and flavus are potent inducers of innate immune responses in human airway cells. Considering the presence of Aspergillus spores in the air, differentiation between transient spore contact and invasion, as represented by germ tube formation, is important in order to determine proper immunological response. Moreover, these results can also provide additional data in understanding pathophysiology of hypersensitivity reactions due to the aspergilli. Background: The importance of indoor bioaerosols has been emphasized in the last decades. It is the fact that hospital environment is often contaminated with fungal spores and control of the air quality in hospital wards has assumed great importance. Exposure to the spore floating on the air in hospital wards leading to appearance of several diseases that ranges from allergies to sever fungal infections in hospitalized patients. The aim of this study was to identify and evaluation of fungal air contamination rates in high risk wards of a teaching hospital in Shiraz, southern Iran. Materials and Methods: A settle plate assay was used for air sampling. Petri dishes containing Sabouraud and Malt extract agar were opened and exposed in high risk wards of a teaching hospital and incubated for five to ten days. The colonies are then identified, enumerated, and reported as the number depositing in one square meter of surface rooms. Results: A total of 528 microbial colonies were detected which 223 (42.23%) colonies yielded fungi. Fungal isolates belongs to 12 genera as follows: Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria, Trichosporon, Aureobasidium, Mucor, Rhizopus, Chrysosporium, Curvularia, Trichothecium, Stachybotrys, Stemphylium, Acremonium, Bipolaris and Yeast. 4.25 percent of rooms were as clean room and Cladosporium was the predominant fungal isolates. The highest and lowest fungal spore concentration were 1015 and zero colony forming unite in emergency and transplantation rooms, respectively. Conclusion: Cladosporium, Aspergillus and many other fungi are the major aeroallergens and causative agent of nosocomial infections. Detection of these fungi from hospital area has a potential risk of infection to these diseases.",

Rationale: Recently, asthmatic tissue-derived cells are reported to retain their characteristic features such as steroid insensitivity even when cultured for a long time. In our previous study, we identified many differences in gene expression patterns containing interferon-inducible CXC chemokine genes in fibroblasts derived from allergic (AF) and nonallergic (NF) patients, although the fibroblasts were cultured and stimulated under the same conditions. Therefore, we determined differences in gene expression of IP-10/CXCL10 and I-TAC/CXCL11 between AF and NF. Methods: Nasal fibroblasts were isolated from inferior turbinate mucosa from allergic (AF) and nonallergic (NF) patients. Cells were stimulated with IL-4, TNF-\", IFN-,, IFN-$, poly I:C or their combination. After mRNA was extracted, the expression of IP-10/CXCL10 and I-TAC/CXCL11 was examined using real-time PCR. Results: IP-10/CXCL10 and I-TAC/CXCL11 were more down-regulated when stimulated with IL-4 and TNF-\" in AF compared to NF, whereas their expression levels were increased when treated with TNF-\" alone in AF. In addition, we found mRNA expression of these genes was significantly more strongly up-regulated by TNF-\" in AF than in NF. Conclusion: We identified specific gene expression profiles containing interferon-inducible CXC chemokine genes in AF and NF. The expression of IP-10/CXCL10 and I-TAC/CXCL11 was up-regulated in AF compared to NF even after cultured for several weeks in the same culture condition, suggesting genetic or epigenetic modification may be involved in its mechanism. Additional studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanism underlying this finding.",

LTB4 plays important physiological roles on leukocytes trafficking to the site of infection and clearance of invaded microorganisms. However, overproduction of LTB4 is reported to cause inflammatory diseases including bronchial asthma and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, much work has been done to prepare LTB4 antagonists for clinical use as anti-inflammatory drugs. Unfortunately, no antagonist has yet been developed for clinical medicinal application. Recently, a novel cell surface receptor (BLT2) for LTB4 has been isolated and its molecular cloning has also been established. Current studies on LTB4 antagonists and its receptors (BLT1, BLT2) suggest the possibility of the development of new clinical drugs for treating arteriosclerosis, immunosuppression of allograft rejection in organ transplantation, psoriasis, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Stable compounds with definite conformation should be favorable as antagonists.

Seoul National University College of Medicine, Departments of Otorhinolaryngology, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Background: According to recent reports, inducible form (type II) of nitric oxide synthase is expressed at higher levels in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients, and these patients show a higher carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus than normal adults. Aim: Are to investigate the role of staphylococcal enterotoxin B in the development of allergic rhinitis and to determine its relevance with inducible nitric oxide synthase overexpression. Methods: The nasal mucosa and serum were obtained from the sensitized and negative control groups, and the frequencies of allergic symptoms, such as sneezing, were compared. Eosinophil counts and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the nasal mucosa were examined. The serum levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE were measured by ELISA. Differences between the sensitized and control groups were statistically analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The frequencies of sneezing, serum levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and degrees of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression were significantly higher in the groups locally sensitized with a mixture of ovalbumin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B or ovalbumin alone than in the negative control group or in the group locally sensitized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B alone. Conclusion: Inducible nitric oxide synthase may play a crucial role in the development of allergic rhinitis whereas staphylococcal enterotoxin B may not participate in this process.",

We sought to investigate the effects of probiotic organisms in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. Methods: First, Balb/c mice were treated with two probiotic organisms Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei via gavaging needle for two weeks daily before Dermatophoides pteronyssinus (Der p) allergen sensitization and for another two weeks during sensitization and allergen challenge. Second, to know the dose effect of Lactobacillus paracasei, we further investigated the ability of three doses of Lactobacillus paracasei, 5 \u00c2 107CFU/ml, 107CFU/ml and 3 \u00c2 106CFU/ml, in the prevention of allergic airway inflammation. Results: First, we found that treatment with Lactobacillus paracasei significantly elevated Th1 cytokine, IL-12 in bronchoaveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and decreased Der p-specific IgG1 in serum but there were no changes in airway hypersensitivity, influx of inflammatory cells to the lung and serum IgE level. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus did not have any significant effects. In the second part, treatment with medium dose (107CFU/ml) of Lactobacillus paracasei significantly attenuated the influx of total leukocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes to the airway and elevated IL-12 in BAL, Der p-specific IgG2a in serum. Medium dose of Lactobacillus paracasei also decreased airway hyperresponsiveness and increased IFN-, production in Der p stimulated splenocytes. The high dose of Lactobacillus paracasei reduced the influx of total leukocytes, monocytes in BAL and IL-4 production in Der p stimulated splenocytes, increased Der p-specific IgG2a in serum and IFN-, production in Der p stimulated splenocytes. The low dose of Lactobacillus paracasei only elevated Der p-specific IgG2a in serum, IFN-, production in Der p stimulated splenocytes and reduced the splenocyte proliferation activity. Conclusion: Our results show that oral treatment with probiotics can attenuate allergic airway inflammation by increasing Th1 immune response and these effects are strain specific and dose dependent.",

Pollen grains among them are known as a causative agent which cause respiratory allergy in susceptible individuals. In this program, a rural area at Howrah district, Domjur Block near Kolkata was selected for our aerobiological and clinico-immunological studies. The area was selected as it is rich in vegetation and a high density of population suffering from respiratory allergy. Aerobiological Study was done using Burkard sampler. Preparation of allergenic extracts was done using pure bulk of pollen grains using 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Skin tests (SPT) with different pollen extracts were performed following the method of Stytis (1982 ) . Sensitive sera were collected from the patients visiting the outpatients' Department of the Allergy Clinic of the Institute of Child Health, Calcutta. Normal sera were obtained from healthy donors with no history or symptoms of atopy. Electrophoresis and Western blotting was analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (1970) . In order to prepare a pollen calendar, at Domjur, rich in vegetation with wide agricultural farming aerobiological survey was done. 47 air borne pollen types were recorded and identified from the air of Domjur. The dominant types were, Areca catechu, Cocos nucifera, Phoenix sylvesrtis, Riccinus communis, Lantana camara, Perthenium hysterophorus, Trema orientalis, Moringa olifera, Carica pa paya, Catharanthus roseus, Casuarina equisetifolia, Albizzia lebbeck, Cyperus rotundus etc. Among the dominant pollen types, some were subjected to Skin Prick Test. Areca catechu, Carica papaya, Catharanthus roseus, Cocos nucifera, Amaranthus spinosus, Borassus flabellifer, Lantana Camara were found to be highly positive. Carica papaya pollen was selected for the biochemical and clinical investigations. SPT reaction was studied with the relevant pollen extract on 320 respiratory allergic patients and 30% of them showed a positive response. The native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of Carica pollen and fruit showed the presence of a number of protein bands . In IgE specific dot immunoblotting of Carica pollen showed remarkable cross reaction with papain, an enzyme present in the latex, fruit and other plant parts.",

Kyunghee University Hospital, Dept. of ORL-HNS, Seoul, Republic of Korea. The Background of the study: Eosinophils are found in the nasal lavage fluid and nasal biopsies of patients with allergic rhinitis after nasal antigen challenge. Numerous studies have been carried out to clarify the paticipation of eosinophils in a late-phase allergic reaction or airway hyperresponsiveness. However, there has been a few report describing in detail the role of eosnophils during an early-phase allergic reaction. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of nasal eosinophil infiltration before and after nasal provocation test and to evaluate the changes of degree of nasal eosinophil infiltration according to the duration of allergic rhinitis. Methods: One hundreds and forty-five allergic rhinitis patients who were diagnosed by allergic work-up were included. The patients were divided into three groups by duration of symptoms. Group 1 was the patients whose duration of symptoms was less than 2 years (n = 40), group 2, 2 to 9 years (n = 58), and group 3, more than 10 years(n = 47). Symptom scores of the patients were checked for nasal obstruction, watery rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching with visual analogue scale. Nasal mucosal scraping and smear was performed with curette at before and 30 min after nasal allergen provocation. Degree of eosinophil infiltration was evaluated in each slide by 6-point scale. And degree of eosinophil infiltration was compared between before and after provocation. The degree of eosinophil infiltration was evaluated and compared according to the duration of symptoms. Results: Prominent nasal symptoms of all 3 groups was nasal obstruction and it was increased by duration of symptoms. But other symptoms were more severe in group 2 than in other group. Group 2 and 3 showed higher degree of eosinophil infiltration compared with Group 1. And degree of eosinophil infiltration was increased after provocation in group 2 and 3. Conclusions: The eosinophil infiltration is increased even in early stage of allergen provocation and increase of eosinphil infiltration in the nasal mucosa after provocation is more significantly in chronic state. Eosinophil may be involved in early reaction of allergy, especially in chronic state.",

Previous linkage and association studies has suggested the presence of a susceptibility gene for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) close to, or within, the cytochrome P450 2D6 gene which could play an key role in pathophysiology of AS. In our study, we examined whether common mutations of cytochrome P450 (CYP) [CYP2C9*2,*3, CYP2C19*2, and CYP2D6*3,*4,*6,*7 and *8] are involved in outcome of AS in Algerian patients and, find out and determine genotype frequency in Algerian population. Methods: CYP genotype was determined in 160 AS patients [fulfilling the modified Naw York criteria] and 204 healthy non-related subjects. DNA isolated from blood samples was used for the analysis of CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 allelic variants by allele-specific real-time PCR. Thus, with respect to allelic variant frequencies, genotype distributions or predicted phenotypes were deduced from genotype combinations. Results: i) no significant difference was found in CYP2D6 allelic variants between AS patients and control subjects; ii) the CYP2C9*3 allelic variant is more frequent in AS patients than healthy subjects (pc=0,015,OR=2,98); iii) CYP2C19*2 allelic variant is more frequent in AS patients than healthy subjects (pc=0,009, OR=2,06) ; iiii) and the frequency of the Bintermediate metabolizers^genotype and/or phenotype for substrates of CYP2C19 is 2-fold more important in AS patients than controls (pc=0.0009). Conclusion: It would exist a possible role of CYP2C9 and C19 polymorphisms in the risk for development of AS and probably on the metabolism of some drugs used in treating AS patients.",

Background: Exosomes are nanovesicles originating from multivesicular bodies that are secreted by a variety of cell types. The dual capability of exosomes to promote immunity or to induce tolerance has prompted their clinical use as vehicles for vaccination against different human diseases. In the present study, the effect of allergen-specific exosomes from tolerized mice on the development of allergen-induced allergic response was determined using a mouse model. Methods: Mice were tolerized by respiratory exposure to the olive pollen allergen Ole e 1. Exosome-like vesicles were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the animals by the well-established filtration and ultracentrifugation procedure, characterized by electron microscopy, western blot and FACS analyses, and assessed in a prophylactic protocol. To this end BALB/c mice were intranasally treated with tolerogenic exosomes or naBve exosomes as a control, one week prior to sensitization/challenge to Ole e 1. Blood, lungs and spleen were collected and analyzed for immune responses. Results: Intranasal pretreatment with tolerogenic exosomes inhibited IgE response along with a marked reduction of lymphoproliferative response and Th2 cytokine production. Moreover, the pathologic alterations of the lung associated with airway inflammation, such as eosinofilia, were significantly suppressed. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that exosomes can induce tolerance and protection against allergic sensitization in mice. Thus, exosome-based vaccines could represent an alternative to conventional therapy for allergic diseases in humans.",

Background: Food allergy is an early and potentially life-threatening manifestation of Fatopy march'. There is limited published epidemiological data of food allergy in Chinese children. To plan for possible intervention to prevent the development of food allergy, it is important to identify its disease spectrum and risk factors in our population. This study aims to determine the prevalence and clinical features for self-reported food allergy in Hong Kong preschool children. Methods: Children aged 2-6 years living in Hong Kong were recruited through randomly selected nurseries and kindergartens for this study to ascertain the presence of self-reported symptoms of food allergy and other atopic disorders. The parental questionnaire was developed from the Chinese version of International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire, with addition of validated items on details of food allergy. Results: 3827 children from 21 local nurseries and kindergartens returned our study questionnaires, of which 3677 (96.1%) children were evaluable for food allergy. Two hundred and fifty-three (6.9%) children were born in mainland China and subsequently migrated to Hong Kong. Four hundred and twentytwo (11.5%) children were currently avoiding any food. The prevalence rates of self-reported food allergy and self-reported, doctor-diagnosed food allergy were 8.1% and 4.6%, respectively. The figures for ever wheeze, doctordiagnosed asthma and current flexural eczema were 14.0%, 5.0% and 31.9%. The six leading causes of self-reported food allergy in our Chinese children were shellfish (15.8%), egg (9.1%), peanut (8.1%), beef (6.4%), cow's milk (5.7%) and nuts (5.0%). When compared with children born and raised in Hong Kong, children born in mainland China had significantly lower prevalence of self-reported food allergy (4.0% versus 6.7%; P = 0.016), doctor-diagnosed asthma (1.7% versus 5.4%; P = 0.006) and current rhinoconjunctivitis (13.9% versus 25.4%; P G 0.001) but not current flexural eczema (P = 0.257). The occurrence of food allergy was strongly associated with current wheeze, rhinoconjunctivitis and flexural eczema (P G 0.001 for all). Conclusion: Food allergy is a significant atopic disorder in Hong Kong preschool children, and coexisting airway and skin allergies are also commonly seen in these children. Further studies to identify early life feeding and environmental factors for food allergy are needed.",

Background: Mashhad locates in North-East of Iran and so close to the borders of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, also considered as a migrated city due to religious reasons. Injecting Drug Users are increasing due to its lower cost and other interests especially in marginalized regions. Sharing the contaminated syringes and injecting tools is the most important and common way of HIV transmission in the country and city. Peer education with PLHIVs among their peers and most at risk groups such as IDUs is a strategy of positive prevention which also helps as psychosocial support for PLHIVs. Mashhad Positive Club established to empower PLHIVs based on the national AIDS program and positive prevention through UNAIDS, MOH CDC and Family Planning Association support. Method: After preparing PE Protocol and call for action, we trained 7 PLHAs including 3 of them were IDU. They were going to the ruins, places for group injection (blood sharing) and some in Drop In Centers in Daravey and Nodeh, two marginalized regions of Mashhad. They have trained their peers, IDUs and other positives, by face to face talking and distributing harm reduction packages including syringes and condoms for safer sex came out through FGD. The process monitoring was being done by writing a daily and weekly report, going with another peer educator and officer direct visit.

Results and Conclusion: Based on one month evaluation (1-31 July 2007) 455 IDUs (431 Male and 24 Female),%88 of them were 20-30 years old, have been trained by PLHAs and referring to DIC to exchange syringe program and getting condoms or start MMT increased about 42 percent. An indirect finding is health care workers in DIC have changed their attitude to PLHAs and see them not as a problem also as key of problem solving which would be decreasing social stigma.",

Background: The relationship between artificial food colouring and benzoate perservative (AFCP) intake and behaviour has hitherto been contentious. We have previously shown in a population based DBPCFC study, an adverse effect of AFCP on parentally-rated behaviour of 3 year olds and have now confirmed the observations in 144 8Y9 year olds and 153 3 year olds using objective measures of observed behaviours in a school setting. One potential mechanism is IgE independent histamine release from circulating basophils. Methods: From the second challenge study we have genotyped the children using buccal cells and related findings to the magnitude of the behavioural response to challenge. Results: Polymorphisms of catecholamine genes, COMT Val108Met and ADRA2A C1291G, previously associated with ADHD, had no impact on responses but T939C and Thr105Ile polymorphisms of the histamine Nmethyltransferase gene (HNMT) significantly (p=0.02 and 0.04 respectively) adversely affected responses to AFCP challenge. Conclusion: HNMT polymorphisms impair histamine clearance and AFCP cause histamine release. The presence of Histamine 3 receptors in the brain provides a potential mechanism (and therapeutic target) to explain the effect we observed. Many environmental factors increase histamine including infections and many foods. This would explain the frequent claim that food intolerance and infections adversely affect behaviour in some children. This gene by environment interaction should be investigated in relation to AFCP induced urticaria, asthma and other atopic conditions.",

Background: In vitro determination of serum specific IgE (sIgE) is an essential diagnostic tool in allergy. Clinical analysis laboratories offer different methods / technologies to determine sIgE, in some cases with highly variable and poorly interchangeable results, concerning the different allergens. Rotation between different methods may compromise allergic patients follow-up, namely in those situations that may benefit from sequential sIgE determinations, as food allergy and specific immunotherapy efficacy evaluation. Aim: To verify the availability of written information concerning the method used in sIgE determination in lab result reports from clinical analysis laboratories in Lisbon District. Methods: During 2 months (April and May 2007), 3 Immunoallergologists collected serum sIgE result reports from the patients they observed. Reports from 50 different clinical analysis laboratories within Lisbon district were obtained and analysed. Labs that did not mention the method that had been used to sIgE determination were further inquired by phone, in order to get that information. Results: Among the 50 reports analysed, only 13/50 (26%) specified the method that had been used, namely the immunoenzimatic (IE) method in 9 and the chemiluminescent (QL) method in 4. Among the remaining 37 labs, when later contacted by phone, we verified that 17/37 (46%) were using IE method, 14/37 (38%) QL and 6/37 (16%) were using both methods, according to the different allergens. In 27/50 laboratories (54%), BRAST^was used as synonym of sIgE. Conclusion: We intend to alert to the generalized lack of written information concerning the methods used in serum sIgE determinations in the lab reports from Lisbon district laboratories. This lack of written information, the persistence of the incorrect use of the term BRAST^and the simultaneous use maintenance. Treated patients and placebo were compared by Pearson test. P values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. Results: 30 adult patients were enrolled and 26 completed the study, with 1 dropout in the active and 3 dropouts in the placebo group. In SLIT patients the peak diameter of LLR was reduced 9 50% in 8/14 (57%). No change in LLR was seen in 11 of 12 placebo patients, and a systemic reaction (generalized urticaria) occurred in a patient on re-sting. The difference was significant (P = .004) between the 2 groups. No adverse event was reported and no discontinuation of SLIT was required. Conclusion: HB-SLIT significantly reduced the extent of LLR in HB allergic subjects, and its safety profile was satisfactory. This pilot study envisages the possible use of SLIT also in hymenoptera allergy, and trials in patients with systemic reactions should be the next step to confirm our observations.",

Background: Mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) has been shown to be effective in controlling the nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). An analysis of subject-reported symptom data in MFNS trials was performed to determine the impact of MFNS on ocular symptoms. This analysis evaluated the effects of MFNS on SAR patients with varying degrees of symptom severity and differences in symptom reduction in the morning (AM) and evening (PM). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of data pooled from four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (three 2-week; one 4-week) with similar protocols that compared the effectiveness of MFNS 200 mcg QD and placebo in controlling ocular symptoms in subjects aged Q12 years with a Q2-year history of SAR. The analysis reviewed change from baseline over a 15-day period in symptom scores for eye tearing, itching, and redness on a 4-point scale (0=none; 3=severe), and calculated total ocular symptom score (TOSS). The effect size of the Days 1Y15 average for subjects with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms at baseline was compared, and TOSS was evaluated approximately 12 hours postdose (PM) and on arising, approximately 24 hours postdose (prior to dosing on next day, AM). Results: Subjects in the MFNS (n = 491) and placebo (n = 492) groups had similar baseline clinical and demographic characteristics. The mean baseline TOSS was 4.35 (PM 4.39; AM 4.32) for the MFNS group and 4.5 (PM 4.60; AM 4.43) for the placebo group. The decrease in TOSS with MFNS for the Day 1Y15 interval was -19.8% vs -5.6% for placebo (PG0.001); the difference reached statistical significance at Day 3. For the same time period, scores for tearing decreased by -22.2% with MFNS vs -13.9% with placebo (PG0.001), for eye itching by -17.3% with MFNS vs -12.3% with placebo (P=0.002), and for redness by -15.7% with MFNS vs -8.3% with placebo (P=0.002). For the mild, moderate, and severe symptom groups, the improvements in TOSS with MFNS over placebo were 0.30, 0.42, and 0.50, respectively. Reductions in individual symptom scores were significantly greater with MFNS than with placebo in both the PM (Pe0.006) and AM (Pe0.001). Importantly, differences in TOSS between MFNS and placebo in the PM (0.36) and AM (0.43) were similar. Conclusion: MFNS reduced ocular symptoms of SAR over 24 hours regardless of subjects' baseline symptom severity.",

This allergen, Sa-II, was shown to be a 34-kDa protein -rich in aspartic and glutamic acids. Heat-stability of this allergen has been documented. However, no studies have shown yet the effect of vinegar on this allergen. This study aimed to demonstrate if vinegar soaking prior to cooking would have an effect on shrimp allergenicity, based on skin test results. Methods: Eighteen shrimp-allergic and eighteen non-shrimp-allergic pediatric patients were subjected to skin prick test using conventionally-prepared shrimp extract. Mean wheal diameters obtained were compared to mean wheal diameters obtained using 3 experimental shrimp extracts prepared with preliminary vinegar soaking. For the adult group, twenty-six shrimp-allergic and twenty-six non-shrimp-allergic parients were included. Results: Mean wheal diameters obtained using shrimp extract prepared with preliminary vinegar soaking were significantly smaller than mean wheal diameters obtained using conventionally prepared extract. Wheal diameters obtained for shrimp-allergic patients were significantly bigger than wheal diameters obtained fo non-shrimp-allergic individuals. Results were similar for pediatric and adult patients. Conclusion: Results indicate that vinegar soaking prior to cooking can reduce shrimp allergenicity. With resources, further validation of results using doubleblind placebo-controlled food challenges woul be ideal.",

Background: Perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) is a highly prevalent disease globally and is the most common chronic disease in children. Nasal obstruction and other bothersome symptoms of PAR need to be treated year round. Previous studies have shown the intranasal corticosteroid mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) to be well tolerated and clinically effective in relieving the symptoms of PAR. A study was conducted to assess effectiveness of MFNS and patient satisfaction with treatment in pediatric and adult subjects. Methods: In this prospective, open-label, multicenter study, 33 Peruvian subjects (age 8 to 69 years) with clinically diagnosed PAR recorded nasal symptom data in a diary. Total nasal symptom score (TNSS) was evaluated at 15 and 30 days. Subjects also rated satisfaction with treatment, and the investigators evaluated adverse events. Results: Thirty-three subjects (61% female, 39% male) received MFNS 100 or 200 mcg QD (pediatric or adult dose). Their mean TNSS was reduced from 10.7 (T 2.9 SD) at baseline to 4.1 (T 2.9 SD) at 15 days and 1.6 (T 2.2 SD) at 30 days (PG0.001 for both reductions). At days 15 and 30, 25 subjects (76%) and 31 subjects (94%), respectively, rated themselves as satisfied or very satisfied with treatment. Mild adverse events (nasal irritation, sneezing, epistaxis, and cough) occurred in 7 (21%); one subject stopped treatment due to nasal irritation. Conclusion: Mometasone furoate nasal spray 100 or 200 mcg QD safely and effectively improved symptoms of PAR in children and adults.",

Background: Chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis are diseases of the nasal and sinus mucosa that affect approximately 15% and 4% of the population, respectively. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is standard surgery for both diseases after failure of medical treatment. Approximately 20% of surgery patients experience impaired wound healing following FESS, leading to recurrences of sinusitis or complications requiring further surgery. A doubleblind multicenter study found that 6 months' treatment with the intranasal corticosteroid mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) 200 mcg QD after surgery for bilateral nasal polyps significantly prolonged the time to recurrence compared with placebo. This study was undertaken to investigate whether use of MFNS following FESS improves wound healing over 6 months. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, subjects with a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis or nasal polyps were randomized to receive 6 months' treatment with MFNS 200 mcg BID or placebo beginning approximately 2 weeks after FESS. Endoscopic scores were assessed at 1 and 2 weeks, and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the investigator`s assessment of treatment outcome at 6 months. A combination score was derived from scores for inflammation, edema, and polyps. Postoperative symptom scores were recorded at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. Results: Of the 99 randomized subjects, 91 (46 MFNS, 45 placebo) were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Subjects in the MFNS group received oral steroids for the first 10 days postsurgery. For 24 subjects (11 MFNS, 13 placebo) who discontinued, results from the last study visit were used. Preoperative symptom scores in the two groups were similar. At 6 months, investigators`assessment of treatment outcome and reductions in total endoscopic scores in all subjects were superior, but did not reach statistical significance, with MFNS versus placebo. Combination endoscopic scores at 6 months showed significantly improved healing with MFNS versus placebo for all subjects (median scores: 0.0 vs 3.0, P=0.02) and those with nasal polyps (median scores: 2.0 vs 4.0, PG0.03). MFNS was well tolerated. Conclusion: Treatment with MFNS following sinus surgery improved healing, particularly in subjects with an initial diagnosis of nasal polyps, and was well tolerated.",

Beijing Children`s Hospital, Department of ORL-HNS, Beijing, China. Background: Approximately 40% of children and adolescents in China suffer from symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR). Effective treatment of AR in children is important in minimizing or preventing behavioral problems and poor academic performance and may help prevent the development of comorbid disorders such as asthma, adenoidal hypertrophy, and otitis media with effusion. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) on clinical symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in Chinese children with AR. Methods: A total of 273 symptomatic children aged Q6 years and e12 years with documented seasonal or perennial AR were treated in an open-label study of MFNS 100 mcg QD for 4 weeks. Eligible subjects had a nasal stuffiness/ congestion score Q2 (on a scale of 0=no symptoms and 3=worst symptoms) and a total nasal symptom score (TNSS) Q8 (total of the individual symptom scores for rhinorrhea, congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing) at the start of treatment. The primary efficacy variable was a change in the TNSS, and the coprimary variable was a change in the individual symptom scores, while the secondary efficacy variables included overall efficacy and Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis QoL Questionnaire (PRQLQ) scores (assessing nasal and eye symptoms, behavior, and daily life). Results: MFNS significantly (PG0.05) reduced TNSS from baseline (mean 9.16) after 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment (mean scores 5.41, 3.47, and 2.10, respectively). Significant improvements from baseline were observed at each week for all individual nasal symptoms. The percentages of patients achieving a 25% improvement (indicating at least moderate symptom reduction) from baseline in TNSS at weeks 1, 2, and 4 were 74%, 95%, and 96%, respectively. Moderate-to-complete symptom relief was reported by 71% of subjects at week 1 and 99% at week 4. Significant reductions (improvements) from baseline in total and individual PRQLQ scores were seen at weeks 2 and 4. Mean behavior PRQLQ scores decreased by a statistically significant amount from 13.99 at baseline to 5.70 at week 2 and 2.71 at week 4. Mean PRQLR scores decreased from 8.30 at baseline to 3.12 at week 2 and 1.72 at week 4. Less than 2% of subjects reported adverse events.

Beijing Tongren Hospital, Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing, China. Background: Between 20% and 40% of urban-dwelling adolescents and adults in China report symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR). Unlike other regions where pollen allergy is common, in China dust mites and/or silk are the more prevalent allergens. Consequently, many Chinese people with AR suffer from symptoms throughout the year. One recent study found that once-daily mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) was an effective treatment for AR in Chinese people in Hong Kong. An open-label study was undertaken to evaluate further the effect of MFNS on clinical symptoms and quality of life in Chinese patients with AR. Methods: A total of 500 subjects aged Q12 years to e70 years with a physician diagnosis and documented medical history of seasonal or perennial AR were treated with MFNS 100 mcg QD for 28 days at 10 centers in China. At the screening visit, eligible subjects had a total nasal symptom score (TNSS) Q8 (maximum of 12) and a nasal stuffiness/congestion score Q2 (maximum of 3). The primary efficacy variables were change from baseline in TNSS and individual symptom severity scores for congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching. Secondary efficacy variables were change from baseline in scores for interference with sleep and daytime activities on the Nocturnal Rhinoconjunctivitis QoL Questionnaire (NRQLQ) and the Mini-Rhinoconjunctivitis QoL Questionnaire (Mini-RQLQ), respectively. Results: MFNS significantly (PG0.05) reduced TNSS and individual nasal symptom scores from baseline at each evaluation. Mean TNSS at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 4 were 9.24, 5.78, 3.99, and 2.98, respectively. Corresponding mean scores for nasal congestion were 2.37, 1.57, 1.14, and 0.84; similar improvement was seen with the other nasal symptoms. At week 4, 94.4% of subjects reported moderate-to-compete relief of AR symptoms. Total and individual NRQLQ scores and scores for sleep problems and for symptoms during sleep and on awakening were significantly reduced after 1 week of treatment. There were significant reductions from baseline in total Mini-RQLQ scores and scores for activity problems and symptoms during activity after 1 week. MFNS was well tolerated. Conclusion: MFNS 100 mcg QD effectively reduced symptoms of AR, improved the quality of sleep and daytime activities, and was well tolerated in Chinese patients with AR.",

Introduction: Allergic diseases are common disorders with increasing rate during the last 30 years. almost 30% of people have a kind of allergic disorders during their life. Mites in house dust are the most important allergens in allergic disorders. The optimal growth conditions for mites are temperature and humidity and the most important sites are inside bedding, mattresses and carpets. The aim of this study is the survey of frequency of Dermatophagoides and their allergens in the homes of allergic patients. Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study has been performed in Tabriz and Mashhad cities, two major industrial centers in north western and north eastern Iran, respectively, from 2005 to 2006. Twenty three allergic patients with positive skin prick test to mites from each city were selected and all of the methods for evaluation of mites and their allergens (specific antibodies of Derp and Derf, density of mites and concentrations of mite allergens) were measured. Because of high density of mites in carpets and bedding, sampling was obtained from these two sites. Results: The frequency of mite density in the homes of allergic patients was 32.6%, 95%CI, 31.25 to 33.95; specific antibody to mite allergens was 23.9%, 95%CI: 23.78 to 24; and concentration of HDM allergens which is performed by ELISA, was not detectable. Conclusion: Mites are common in worldwide, but the incidence of them is various in different parts of world. The frequency of mites and their allergens in two large provinces of Iran are lower than other studies, performed in other parts of world. The most important factor in frequency and growth of them is environmental humidity, and the other factors such as carpets and bedding have less importance.",

Background: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis varied across centres from 0.8% to 14.9% in the 6Y7-year-olds and from 1.4% to 39.7% in the 13Y14year-olds. The recent guidelines of Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) group, classified it as the frequency and severity may not be appropriate for the children age group. The present study evaluates the childhood and adult patients with the ARIA classification and analyzed the clinical features of each age group. Methods: 1,375 subjects with allergic rhinitis diagnosed by skin-prick test at our hospital from December 2005 to July 2007 were included. These patients were classifed according to age; babyhood(1Y4 years), preschoolers (5Y7 years), elementary schoolers (8Y13 years), adolescents (14Y19 years), young adults (20Y35 years), adults (36Y55 years), middle age (55Y64 years), old age (65 years).Clinical features including nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing, postnasal drip(PND), ocular symptoms and sleep disturbance and the allergen was analyzed in each age group according to the ARIA classification. Results: A similar distribution of the ARIA classification groups were shown among all ages; Mild & intermittent group 27.5%, moderate to severe & intermittent group 17.8%, mild & persistent 18.5%, moderat to severe & persistent 34.9%. There was a higher proportion of nasal obstruction(p=0.04) and PND(p=0.042) in babyhood & preschoolers compared to adults, but ocular symptoms(p=o.01) and sneezing(p=0.01) were shown more frequently in adults. PND, sleep disturbance, nasal itching showed no distributional difference between children and adults. For allergens, housedust mite(p=0.07) showed a higher proportion in children whereas grass(p=0.01) and weed(p=0.021) was more frequent in adults. Clinical features, IgE and serum eosinophile count showed no significant relationship in each age ARIA classification group. Conclusion: Classification of the ARIA group into different ages helded to identify the different clinical manifestations among children and adults. A new treatment strategy taking children's clinical features into account is deemed necessary.",

One of the interesting clinical associations is between chronic urticaria with positive autologous serum skin test (ASST) and thyroid disease. CIU and chronic tyroiditiis has not been completely investigated. Methods: We studied 94 patients (65 female and 39 male; mean age 44.7 years; range 15Y78 years) who had CIU and a history of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function was investigated by means of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fT3 and fT4 measurement and thyroid ultrasound. Thyroid antibodies (anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin), total serum IgE levels and ASST were performed in all patients. Results: Antibodies to thyroglobulin and to peroxidase were positive in 26/94 patients (27.7%) with CIU and morphological or volumetric abnormalities of the thyroid gland by ultrasonography. All the CIU patients with autoimmune thyroiditis had a normal thyroid function, a negative ASST and a normal total serum IgE levels (74.3 +/j 14.9 IU/ml; normal value G100 IU/ml). Antibodies anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase were negative in 68/94 (72.3%) CIU patients, of which 44/68 (64.7%) had high total serum IgE levels (395.2 +/j 180.6 IU/ml) and a negative ASST. Four of the thirty four CIU patients (11.8%) with negative thyroid autoantibodies had a positive ASST and a normal serum IgE levels, while 16/68 (23.5%) patients had a multinodular goiter, ASST negative and normal value of total serum IgE levels. Conclusion: We found a correlation between autoimmune thyroiditis and normal total serum IgE levels in CIU patients with ASST negative. High total serum IgE levels were found in CIU patients without thyroid disease. Thus, in CIU patients the tests to detect thyroid autoantibodies are relevant in particular in patients with normal value of total serum IgE levels.

The molecular weight and the structure of r\"-La were studied by mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD), respectively. The IgE reactivity of r\"-La was analyzed with sera from cow`s milk allergic patients. Biological activity was tested using a humanized rat basophil leukemia cell line that expresses the \"-chain of the human Fc(RI receptor. Calcium dependence of IgE binding of r\"-La was analyzed by IgE immunoblotting. Results: Purified r\"-La showed the expected molecular weight of 15.1 kDa in mass spectrometry. The far UV-circular dichroism spectrum revealed that r\"-La represents a well structured, mainly \"-helical protein. Thermal denaturation experiments using CD showed that the protein retains most of its native-like conformation even at 95-C and thus pointed to an extremely high thermal stability. IgE immunoblots demonstrated that r\"-La binds IgE from cow`s milk sensitized patients and induces specific basophil degranulation. Furthermore, calcium depletion assays led to a reduction of IgE binding in sera from certain cow`s milk allergic patients",

Results: Labial or oral challenge to turnip rape was positive in all (100%) Finnish and five (36%) French children. Mustard challenge was positive in five Finnish and five French children. IgE antibodies to oilseed rape and mustard were frequent (71% -100%) in the Finnish and French children but uncommon (4%) in the controls. IgE levels to 2S albumins were increased in most Finnish and French children, and IgE inhibition experiments showed similar crosswise inhibition patterns.

Sublingual immunotherapy SLIT proved effective and safe in respiratory allergy, therefore its use in hymenoptera allergy can be hypothesized. We aimed at evaluating the clinical efficacy of SLIT with HB venom in beekeepers or their family members, by assessing the effect on LLR to HB stings.

Background: India with a population of a billion and estimated number of allergy & asthma patients running into the millions, had no formal training program in Allergy & Asthma. In spite of significant advances in pharmacological infrastructure, there has been a total lack of formal physician educational programs in this growing important field of medicine. Methods: International Asthma Services (IAS) a charitable organization started by P.K.Vedanthan MD in the late 80s in Colorado,USA dedicated to patient and physician education in allergy and asthma in several parts of the globe, has partnered with Christian Medical College & hospital (CMC) at Vellore,India to initiate a formal training program in the field of allergy & asthma for the first time in India.Diploma in allergy & asthma (DAA) is a year long distance learning course, with Personal Contact sessions(PCS) every quarter, with final oral and written exams at the end of the course. The course is limited to 20 post graduate doctors specialized either in medicine,Pediatrics, respiratory medicine will be selected. International and national faculty teach in this course. Results: The first batch of 18 physicians hailing from different parts of India will be awarded the Diploma this July 2007. The 2nd batch of 20 physicians will be starting the course in the later part of July 2007. Conclusion: This unique partnership between IAS & CMC will hopefully meet the present challenges of unmet physician manpower needs in the field of allergy & asthma in the Indian subcontinent over the coming years. Allergy-Asthma network of India is also is in the process of formation to facilitate free flow of educational,research, charitable activities throughout the country.",

Background: It is a well-known phenomenon that the prevalence of Seasonal Allergic Rhinoconjunctivitis or / and Asthma (SAR/A) is increasing. But there is little data about the changes in frequency of sensitization to pollens in new patients with SAR/A during the time (years). Objective: To determine the frequency of sensitization to three important pollens (Grasses, Parietaria, Olive) in new patients with SAR/A, each year, from 1987 to 2006(20 years) in Greece. Methods: We have studied, each year (from 1987 to 2006), all new patients with solely seasonal typical symptoms of rhinoconjuctivitis or/and asthma and positive Skin Prick Tests (SPT`s) to Grasses, Parietaria and Olive (one or more). SPT`s were considered as positive if the mean of diameters was at least 5-mm larger than the negative control. The proportion of men/women and the mean age (years) in each year, from 1987 to 2006, were similar. For statistical analysis we used the \u00c42 for trend. Results: Patients with SAR/A-positive SPT`s \u00c42 for trend test Grasses x2 = 28,83, p 9 0,05, Parietaria x2 = 63,78, p G 0,001, Olive x2 = 18,96, p 9 0,05.",

Background: The histamine-H1 receptor antagonist, hydroxyzine (H) has a wide variety of therapeutic applications, including the treatment of allergic skin disorders and the control of nausea and vomiting caused by conditions such as motion sickness. It is also used as a tranquilliser for the symptomatic management of conditions such as generalised anxiety disorder and the tension associated with psychoneuroses and in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. It is used too in the management of pruritis associated with allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and histamine-mediated pruritus. Its Ki towards the human histamine H1 receptor is 2 nM. The enzyme semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO; EC 1.4.3.6) exists as a soluble form in plasma and a membrane-bound form associated with the exterior surface of the plasma membrane in many tissues. The membrane-bound form can function as a vascular adhesion in mediating the early stages of inflammatory responses (Salter-Cid et al. JPET 2005). Monoamine oxidase (MAO) B is involved in the oxidative deamination of an histamine metabolite, N-telemethylhistamine. Methods: H inhibitory properties towards the bovine plasma and membranebound form of SSAO and towards rat liver MAO A and B have been investigated as described by O`Sullivan et al. (J Neural Transm 2006). Results: H is a relatively potent competitive inhibitor of bovine plasma SSAO (IC50 = 20T0.5 6M; Ki = 1.8T0.4 6M). H was a somewhat less potent competitive inhibitor of MAO B (Ki = 19T0.4 6M) and a very weak inhibitor of the bovine membrane-bound form of SSAO (IC50 \u00c8 900 6M) and MAO A (IC50 \u00c8 650 6M).Conclusion:The inhibitory values towards the bovine plasma SSAO are higher than the reported plasma levels of the drug when administered at the therapeutic doses of 25Y100 mg/day(Lader & Scotto Psychopharmacol  1998)  [e.g. mean Cmax = 34 ng/ml (91 nM) and 73 ng/ml (195 nM) after a single dose of 25 mg and of 39 mg, respectively(Simons et al.

Background: Many materials such as cosmetic products in daily use, cookware and jewellery can cause contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis which are suffered by the seewed farmers are probably cause by many materials that are used in daily activity. Aim: To evaluate level of CD4 and CD3 that correlated with patch test results on seaweed farmers. Methods and Results: Cross sectional study was conducted in 41 contact dermatitis on seaweed farmers with CD4 and CD3 levels, also was conducted patch test with TROLAB patch test series. The most patients are between 19 Y 28 years old (39%) consist of 10 males (24.4%) and 31 females (75.6%). The increasing of CD4 levels are found on 27 patients (65.9%). The high levels of CD4 and CD3 seem not to be related significantly with the result of patch test (p 9 0.05). Conclusion: The occured contact dermatitis might be caused by other material in seaweed processing or other component from the sea. Larger amount of sample is needed to get significant results and other further investigations might be contributing in the seaweed industries.

Background: Various studies among workers in vineyards and orchards have reported an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms including asthma. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with spider mite allergy among table grape farm workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 207 workers in table grape farms was conducted. Skin prick tests (SPT) used extracts of 8 common aeroallergens (ALK), grape mould (Botrytis cinerea) and Tetranychus urticae (TU). Specific IgE to TU was quantified using ImmunoCAP (Phadia).

Dr. Fooke Allerg-O-LIQ has a good sensitivity, specificity and Agreement to the Pharmacia CAP-System. Comments: Values of sIgE to inhalants detected by different in vitro methods show better correlation than sIgE to FA. Allergens with one dominant major allergen (i.e. e1) seem to be less difficult than complex allergen mixtures (i.e. d1). Identical units (kU/l) are no guarantee for equivalent sIgE results. The data presented do not allow estimates of the true sIgE concentrations or judgement on superiority of one of the tests over the other. Conclusion: Comparative studies are necessary and helpful to define the concordance of sIgE-values detected by different immunoassays. Lack of concordance (complex allergen mixtures 9 simple allergens; FA 9 inhalants) should prompt subsequent improvement of allergens used in test systems detecting specific IgE.

Results: At follow-up, most indicators of the use of MDI and spacer score and asthma control test had improved significantly (p G 0.005) among educated patients. Also cough decreased significantly in the intervention group (p G 0.005). The pulmonary function test did not show increase in FEV1/FVC after this period, it was not statistically significant as compared to the control group. Conclusion: The nursing educational intervention for children with asthma and their parents effectively improved inhaler use skills and decreased cough and ER visits in this group of patients. Regarding the insignificant changes in FEV1/FVC, it should be considered that pulmonary function test is not already seriously affected in the group of intermittent and mild to moderate persistent asthma.

Background: The detrimental effect of chlorofluorocarbon on the ozone layer has resulted in the prohibiting of CFC-containing medication usage. Dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices are alternative devices to deliver medication for treatment of asthma. Drug delivery and lung deposition from DPI are dependent on the peak inspiraory flow rate (PIFR). Methods: Using PIFR meter (Incheck-dial) that mimics the internal resistance of commonly use DPI devices one high-resistance(Turbuhaler) and two lowresistance (Accuhaler and Easyhaler) determined the PIFR generated by asthmatic children aged 5-18 years through each of them. Pulmonary function was measured by using spirometry. Results: 252 asthmatic children were studied, 169(67%) children were male. The mean age was 10.58 + 2.97 years. The mean FEV 1 (% of predicted) was 80.30 + 10.91. The mean PIFR with the internal resistant of turbuhaler, accuhaler and easyhaler was 85.11 + 14.84 L/min, 103.01+16.01 L/min, and 114.72+11.74 L/min, respectively. PIFR was statistically significant correlations with age, body weight and height (p value G0.001). All children could generated PIFR more than 30 L/min in both accuhaler and easyhaler resistance. 8(3.17%) children were unable to generate PIFR more than 60 L/min in turbuhaler resistance. There were no significant correlations of FEV 1 (%of predicted), FEV 1 /FVC% or FEF 25-75 with PIFR. Conclusion: Most children aged at least 5 year can generate enough PIFR for using DPI devices especially in low-resistance devices.Sergey Tereshchenko 1 , Viktor Prokhorenkov 2 , Ivan Novitzkiy 1 , Igor Olkhovsky 1 , Nataliya Shakina 1 , Igor Isakov 1 , and Lyudmila Vasilieva 1 . 1 Medical Research Institute for Northern Problems, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation; Krasnoyarsk State Medical Academy, Russian Ministry of Education, Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation. :",

Background and Aim: Korean traditional medicine (KTM) is popular in Korea. We evaluated the prevalence and compliance of these unproved practices in Korean allergic patients. Methods: 649 allergic patients were enrolled from 10 general hospitals. Their mean age was 42.5T15.3 years old. Proportions of asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria were 50.7%, 41.3%, 26%, and 11.3%, respectively. The Questionnaire which consisted of 12 items regards the prescription rates, reasons for referring to these remedies, and their opinions for the efficacy of KTM. Results: 259 (39.9%) patients had experienced KTM (herbal decoction ?34.2%, herbal pills ?6.0%, acupuncture ?12.3%, moxa cautery ?4.1%), and 33.2% of the patients with the history of KTM experienced 2 or more KTM practices. Patients?income or final academic career did not affect the prescription rates of KTM. 34.6% of the KTM experienced patients were satisfied to the practices (herbal decoction ?35.6%, herbal pills ?22.2%, acupuncture ?34.2%, and moxa cautery ?44.4%), and 40.6% of the KTM experienced patients were inclined to further KTM practices. The patients with respiratory allergic diseases were more satisfactory to KTM than those with allergic skin diseases (p = 0.006). The most frequent reasons for choosing the KTM were safety (15.6%), worries about adverse reactions of the proved drugs (20.2%), and boostering effects on immunity or physical predisposition by KTM (36.3%). However, 18.9% of the patients with KTM had experienced the adverse reactions to the practices; skin rashes ?13.5%, gastrointestinal discomforts ?2.3%, and hepatitis ?0.7%. The prescribed patients expensed 915 US dollars/year on average. Conclusion: Many Korean allergic patients are compliant to KTM and experienced significant adverse reactions. Educations for the proved managements are necessary in Korea.",

The term Buveitis[ encompasses a wide range of intraocular inflammatory disorders primarily or secondarily involving iris, ciliary body or choroids. Later this term was used to describe any intraocular inflammation that affects the uvea, retina, sclera and vitreous humor.There are few reports of the disease in latin children. Materials and Methods: The records of 59 patients with the diagnosis of uveitis, younger than 18 years treated in the service of Immunology at the Instituto Nacional de Pediatria in Mexico City from 1988 to 2004 were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Among 59 children with uveitis 37 (62.7%) were boys and 22 (37.3%) were girls. Mean age was 8,7 years (standard deviation, 3.8, range 2Y17).

Siriraj Hospital, Allergy and Immunology of Pediatric Department, Bangkok, Thailand.Background: Allergic reaction to chemotherapeutic agents among pediatric patients suffering from malignancy is not common and poses an important challenge since alternative agents are not commonly available. We report pediatric cases with adverse drug reaction (ADR) to chemotherapeutic drug reactions who required further management at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Methods: The medical records of children with previous ADR to chemotherapeutic agents from January 2004 through December 2006, were reviewed. They underwent allergic investigations with skin prick tests (SPT), intradermal tests (ID) and drug challenges. Results: Eight patients (3 boys, median age 9.5 years) were documented to have ADR to chemotherapeutic agents. patients). Among five patients with anaphylaxis, two had alternative agents. Three other anaphylaxis patients had no alternative drug and underwent successful graded challenges (all with vincristine). Two of the urticaria patients also underwent successful graded challenges (carboplatin Y 1 case and cyclophosphamide Y 1 case) whereas one was switched to an alternative agent. Conclusion: Although urticaria and anaphylaxis could develop among patients required chemotherapeutic agents, a number of these patients could tolerate a careful and successful graded challenge.835Provocation test in patients with history of aspirin hypersensitivity Krzysztof Specjalski, Marta Chelminska, Karol Kempinski, Krzysztof Kuziemski, and Ewa Jassem. Medical University of Gdansk, Department of Allergology, Gdansk, Poland. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of aspirin provocation test in patients with a history of aspirin hypersensitivity. Methods: Patients with asthma and/or chronic urticaria/angioedema with a history of aspirin hypersensitivity underwent provocation test with aspirin. Single-blind oral provocation test was performed with increasing doses of aspirin (placebo, 50mg, 100mg, 150mg, 300mg) administered orally. Anterior rhinomanometry, spirometry and clinical monitoring were performed before the test, during and after drug administration. Test was considered positive in case of clinical symptoms of hypersensitivity, decline of FEV1 or positive nasal response measured by anterior rhinomanometry. Results: 62 patients (15 males, 47 females) aged from 19 to 71 (mean age: 48 years) including 26 patients with diagnosed asthma and/or nasal polyposis (first group) and 36 patients with urticaria and/or Quinke oedema (second group) were examined. All subjects had a history indicating hypersensitivity to aspirin. Provocation test was positive in 28 patients (45,1%). There was not a significant difference between the groups (first group -positive result in 12 patients (46%), in the second one-14 patients (39%). The mean dose provoking reaction was significantly lower in asthmatics (238,3 mg) than in urticaria/angioedema group (392,8 mg); pG0,05. Conclusion: Oral aspirin provocation test is a valuable tool in final diagnosis in patients with a history of aspirin hypersensitivity. Doses provoking reaction are lower in asthmatics than in urticaria/angioedema patients. Skin tests in Nsaids hypersensitivityA.G. Palma-Carlos, M. Medina, and M.L. Palma-Carlos. Clinical Allergy Immunology Center, CAIC, Allergology, Lisbon, Portugal. Background: The diagnosis of NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) hypersensitivity relies on clinical history and skin or provocation tests. In daily clinical practice double blind placebo controlled provocation tests are not always possible and skin tests must be used first.Methods: 245 patients with a history of rhinitis, bronchospasms, conjunctivitis, urticaria and angioedema, anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions related to ingestion of NSAIDS, mainly to Aspirin (ASA) have been studied. Skin prick tests and intradermal tests when pricks were negative or dubious have been done in 215 cases. Lysine salycilate for ASA and solutions of more commonly used NSAIDS and acetaminophen have been used after discontinuing H1-antihistamines, psychotropic drugs and topical steroids. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Aspirin was tested in 215 patients, diclofenac in 202, ibuprofen in 156, piroxicam-meloxicam in 112, indometacin in 122, nimesulide in 186, celocoxibe in 105, etoricoxibe in 102, metamizol in 37, acetominophen in 172, naproxene in 18, niflumic acid in 2, with a total of 1430 skin tests (prick and ID when necessary). Results: When identification of the drug was possible concordance with positive skin tests was 98%. Positive NSAIDS skin tests: ASA 197 (both ID). Only local reactions have been observed without any severe reaction. Conclusion: Prick tests are more specific but less sensitive than ID which can give false positive results. 3 NSAIDS groups can be considered: 1-Aspirin, diclofenac and metamizol with a higher percentage of positivity. 2-For others NSAID including the newer coxibes positivity around 50%. 3-Nimesulide and acetaminophen with a lower of positivity. Skin tests can be used in NSAIDS hypersensitivity to confirm clinical history but also to choose, case by case, a drug less prone to give hypersensitivity reactions. IgE mediated anaphylactic reaction to omeprazole. Cross reactivity among Proton-Pump Inhibitors Efthalia Stefanaki 1 , Vasilios Vovolis 1 , Ioanna Letsa 2 , and Nikolaos Koutsostathis 1 . 1 Laikon General Hospital, Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Athens, Greece; 2 Leicester Royal Infirmary Hospital, General medicine, Leicester, United Kingdom. Background: Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with an excellent therapeutic index for Helicobacter pylori infection. Anaphylactic reactions to omeprazole have rarely been reported. Case report: A 38 year-old woman was referred to our department with pruritus in the palms, facial angioedema, oedema of eyelids and nose, generalised urticaria, bronchospasm, nausea, dizziness and collapse 15 minutes after the administration of an omeprazole capsule. No other drugs had been administered during the previous 12 hours. She was effectively treated at the emergency department. She had a past medical history of peptic ulcer for which she had been taking Omeprazole for many years. She had no past medical history of atopy. Methods and Results: Skin prick tests with common inhalant, food allergens and other Imidazole derivatives (ketoconazole, metronidazole) were negative. The skin prick test with PPIs was positive to Omeprazole (cap 20mg/ml) and negative to Lansoprazole (cap 30mg/ml) Pantoprazole (tab 40mg/ml) Rabeprazole (tab 10mg/ml) Esomeprazole (tab 20 mg/ml). Intradermal tests were positive for Omeprazole (vial 4mg/ml, 0.004mg, 0.04mg/ml) but they have not been done for other PPIs. Five normal controls were tested and were negative for skin tests to all substances. The serum was tested for IgE Ab (ImmunoCap/Phadia) against omeprazole with experimental prototype reagents and it was negative. The challenge test with omeprazole was not carried out for ethical reasons. Also no adverse reaction occurred when the patient took the capsule shell without the pharmaceutical substance. Subsequently oral challenge in a single blind with placebo procedure was curried out with lansoprazole and rabeprazole and no reaction was reported.Conclusion: Proton pump inhibitors are a rare cause of anaphylaxis but health care professionals need to be aware of this possibility. Skin prick tests proved to be an effective diagnostic tool for the IgE mediated hypersensitivity to PPI. An anaphylactic reaction to one of the PPIs does not necessarily imply cross reactivity with all PPIs. Oral challenge test with negative prick tests to PPIs turned out to be safe and offered the patient the chance to be treated with a different PPI with out any complication.

Tabriz Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Medical Surgical Nursing, Tabriz, Islamic Republic of Iran. Background: Drug hypersensitivity reactions are common and can be life threatening. Drug allergies are adverse reactions resulting from immunologic responses to drugs or their metabolites. These reactions result in predictable patterns of organ-specific or systemic hypersensitivity that usually recur on subsequent exposure to the same drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of drug hypersensitivity in Sina Hospital in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences March 2002 to March 2007. Methods: This descriptive study was done retrospectively by reviewing the existing records of 51 drug eruption diagnosed patients admitted in skin diseases ward of Sina Hospital. Results: 51 patients (17.65 % male and 82.35 % female) have entered our study. Mean age was 36.19 years. Drug eruption was the most common cause of admission (52.94 %) other clinical diagnoses of patients were Angioedema (15.68%) and Stevens Johnson syndrome (21.56%). The most drugs were Cotrimoxazole (89.80 %) and Carbamazepine (17.64%). The following Symptoms are considered: rash, fever, generalized erythema and muculopapular lesions. Conclusion: Early recognition and appropriate treatment of these underlying causes is recommended in order to prevent drug eruption. With special examination and drug history we can diagnosis this hypersensitivity and with this knowledge we can prevent the dangerous reactions. 872 A 63-year-old man with multiple drug allergy and CNS tumor Mojgan Kiani Amin 1 , and Zohreh Rahimi 2 . 1 Qazvin Medical University, Allergy and Immunology, Qazvin, Islamic Republic of Iran; 2 Kermanshah Medical University, Biochemistry, Kermanshah, Islamic Republic of Iran.",

Materials and Methods: 16 children aged 1-36 months with symptoms of atopic eczema and positive specific IgE to cow`s milk proteins were enrolled to the study. The followed diagnostic tools were used to confirm cow`s milk allergy: the concentration of total and sera specific IgE antibodies to milk proteins as casein, \u00e2-lactoglobulin and \u00e1-laktoalbumin, oral food challenge tests to hydrolyzed cow`s milk formula performed following standards. Results: All of children were sensitized to casein, 9/16 of them to \u00e1laktoalbumin and 7/16 to \u00e2-laktoglobulin. The serum concentration of total IgE (mean 623,1 T735,2 vs 88,21 T124,2; p=0,0001) and SCORAD index (mean 60,01 T25,14 vs 52,01 T24,43; p=0,03) was significantly higher in the group of children with allergy to EHF, but no correlation between total IgE and SCORAD index has been stated. The IgE sera concentration to casein and whey proteins was noticed most often in second and third class (0,7-17,5 IU/ ml). The number of plasma eosinophils (p=0,006) and white blood cells (p=0,005) was significantly higher.",

On the Indian subcontinent, B. campestris and B. juncea are extensively cultivated but can share the same growing areas with B. nigra and B. napus as well. A systematic evaluation of allergenic properties of the various species of Brassica has been lacking. Therefore, the present work was aimed at assessing the sensitization as well as heterogeneity in the allergenicity of pollen of the four widely cultivated species of Brassica in India. Allergen extracts from pollen of Brassica were prepared from four different species of Brassica. Skin prick test was performed with the aqueous extracts of mustard pollen and other common inhalant allergens in 159 atopic cases suffering from bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis and referred to allergy units for treatment. Among four species of Brassica pollen, B. campestris is the highest sensitizer (2+ and above) showing skin prick response in 13.20% cases, followed by B. juncea (11.94%) . B. nigra and B. napus pollen showed positivity in 5. 0 % and 4.4% cases respectively. Raised specific IgE in cases positive to pollen are 0.2795 + 0.08423 to B. campestris, 0.3025 + 0.1137 to B. juncea, 0.3380 + 0.1128 to B. nigra and 0.3430 + 0.1648 to B. napus respectively based on O.D values. Immunoblotting of B. campestris, showed 20, 25, 32, 37, 56, 76, 87 and 90 proteins as major allergens (more than 70% of cases). In B. juncea, however individual heterogeneity was observed and proteins of mol wt 14, 20, 25, 32, 37, 56 and 90 kD were major (more than 70% of cases). IgE binding proteins of B. nigra and B. napus were also identified. Thus, we conclude that the pollen from four different species of Brassica grown in India lead to sensitization in atopic patients.",

Besides allergenicity and mycotoxicity, microbial volatile organic compounds also get released from airborne fungi, which may cause lethargy, headache, and irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. The objectives of the present study are to prepare a fungal spore calendar in the air of North Calcutta, India, including their diurnal and circadian periodicity pattern throughout the year; to study the effect of the meteorological parameters on their frequency; and to determine the role of these spores to cause respiratory allergy.Burkard 7-day volumetric sampler and Andersen 2-stage viable sampler were used to monitor the airborne fungal spore and culturable mold concentration over the studied area continuously for four years . Diagnosis of their respiratory allergic disorders was based on detailed medical history followed by their lung function test using Spirometer, skin prick test and measurement of specific IgE level in patients-sera by ELISA. Healthy asymptomatic patients were taken as control. Major allergens of the selected allergenic molds have been identified by 12% SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting. A total of 45 fungal spore types and 24 culturable mold types were identified and recorded throughout the total sampling period. Air sampling showed 14 dominant (4.5Y27% contribution) spores, among which concentrations of Cladosporium sp, Ascospores, Basidiospores and Aspergilli/ Penicilli group are notably high. Different Aspergillus species, Cladosporium sp, Penicillium citrinum, Trichoderma harzianum and Alternaria alternata were among the prevalent culturable molds (9500 CFU/m3 air) as recorded. Common occurrence of respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction and mild type of lung function impairment was noted. Molds like, Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, Trichoderma harzeanum, Rhizopus sp etc. showed high reactivity to the patients. From Trichoderma harzianum two major allergens (35.48 kDa and 15.49 kDa) have been detected by Immunoblotting. The present survey and both qualitative and quantitative information, obtained from the study could be useful for Aerobiologists and Clinicians to forecast fungal spore load to the atmosphere and for therapeutic studies including allergy diagnosis. Genus Alnus is common and widespread in Central and Northern Europe. Major Alnus allergens (Aln gI) are known to cross react with other members of the Fagales order. Aim: Assesment of contrasting regional importance of Alnus pollen in 1996Y2005 within Worcester and Poznan regions, which have differing biogeographical and climatic regimes. Methods: Daily average Alnus pollen counts were collected using Burkard volumetric spore trap. Furthermore we analyzed skin prick test (SPT) results (1996Y2005) and allergen-specific IgE (asIgE) measurement results (2002Y2005) against the above aeroallergen in patients of Allergic Diseases Diagnostic Center at the Department of Dermatology. Results: The average number of Alnus pollen grains recorded annually in Poznan was more than 2.5 times that of Worcester. Furthermore, daily average Alnus pollen counts exceeded the thresholds of 100 grains/m3, 500 grains/m3 and 1000 grains/m3 more frequently in the area of Poznan in comparision to Worcester. Approximately 11% of the population (n = 5032) tested for pollen allergens (SPT) presented positive results for tree pollen allergens and 430 of these were simultaneously positive for Alnus pollens. Annual number of positive SPT results for Alnus pollen allergens was significantly related (pG0.05) to seasonal variations in the magnitude of the Alnus pollen catch in Poznan region. Patients with positive SPT results for Alnus pollen allergens were diagnosed as: pollinosis Y 51%, atopic dermatitis Y 43%, asthma Y 4%, chronic urticaria 1% and eczema Y 1%. Conclusion: There is an undoubtful importance of Alnus pollen allergens, being present in high amount over Poznan region, particularly considering the Background: Cheyletidae mites have been described as an etiological factor for human dermatitis. In our subtropical area this family accounts as one of the most frequently found, after Dermatophagoides spp and Blomia spp, in house dust samples. The potential allergenicity of this mite family is still unknown. Methods: We selected 15 non consecutive patients sensitized to Dermatophagoides spp and/or Blomia spp with perennial respiratory symptoms of rhinoconjuctivitis and asthma without dermatological symptoms, and no pets (dogs, cats and/or birds) at home. Ten subjects with non allergic rhinitis/ asthma were selected as control group. Skin prick test with Cheyletus eruditus extract (1/50 w/v) were performed in the forearm followed by immediate reading at 15 minutes. A skin prick test was regarded as positive with a wheal of at least 3 mm. Results: Thirteen out of 15 subjects showed a positive skin prick test. All patients of the control group had negative readings of the cutaneous test with the same extract. Conclusion: We describe, to our knowledge, the first study to show IgE mediated sensitization to Cheyletidae mite family in patients to respiratory symptoms. More studies are needed to evaluate the actual prevalence in the general population and the clinical relevancy of this allergic sensitization.",

            "text": "Allergenicity of pollen grains and pollen cytoplasmic granules Background: Since decades, epidemiological studies show an increased frequency of respiratory allergies. These diseases coincide with the pollination season but in most cases, no evident correlation with the pollen count is observed. In parallel, several studies have shown that in contact with water and atmospheric pollutants, pollen grains can release pollen cytoplasmic granules PCG (0.5Y3 6m). Due to their small size, they may penetrate deeper into the lungs and might induce higher allergic response. These granules are suspected of playing a role in Bthunderstorm asthma[. The aim of our study was to compare the allergenic potential of PCG with those of the pollen, in the Brown-Norway rat. Methods: PCG are isolated from Phleum pratense pollen by osmotic shock in pure water, following by filtration, centrifugation and two washes. Rats were sensitized (D0) and challenged (D21) intratracheally with pollen (0.5 mg per rat) or purified PCG (1.5x10 6 and 1.5x10 7 PCG per rat). These two quantities correspond to the number of granules released by 0.5 mg of pollen, if 10% or 100% of pollen burst, respectively. Blood samples, bronchial lymph node and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from the rats 4 days after the challenge. The number and type of cells were determined in BALF. The IgE and IgG1 levels in sera were assessed by ELISA. Pollen and PCG-induced proliferation of lymph node cells was monitored by [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation in a lymph node assay. Results: The number of cells in the BALF was 2 times higher in the rats exposed to pollen and to the strongest concentration of PCG (13.8x10 6 and 14.1x10 6 respectively) compared to rats instilled with NaCl (6.7x10 6 ). Only the rats sensitized to pollen show IgE and IgG1 levels higher than those of the controls. The PCG do not induce an increase of the IgE and IgG1 levels. Cultured lymph node cells of pollen or granules-sensitized rats significantly proliferated in the presence of pollen or PCG. However, pollen appeared to be more potent than PCG to induce the lymphocyte proliferation either in pollen and granule-sensitized rats. Conclusion: Phleum pratense pollen induced humoral and cellular allergic responses in our rat model whereas PCG induced only a cellular response. This difference may be due to an extensive wash of the granules and thus a loss of soluble allergens. In perspective, we want to evaluate the allergenicity of nonwashed granules. the patients' leukocytes. We cloned cDNA corresponding to purified Cry j 3 from a cDNA library of Japanese cedar pollen. Results: We purified native Cry j 3 from Japanese cedar pollen as a 27 kDa protein. The IgE-binding frequency of Cry j 3 from the sera of patients allergic to Japanese cedar pollen was estimated as 27% (27/100) by ELISA. Cry j 3 induced the release of histamine from leukocytes. We cloned the cDNA and named it Cry j 3.8. Cry j 3.8 cDNA encoded 225 amino acids and had significant homology with thaumatin-like proteins. Discussion: Cry j 3 is an additional causative allergen in Japanese cedar pollinosis and may play crucial rules in the cross-reactivity with oral allergy syndrome.",

The enzyme catalyzes the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, an important step during synthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. This group of plant secondary metabolites includes pharmacologically active substances like the analgesic morphine.Whereas the physiological function of PR10 class allergens is still unknown, NCS activity was studied in detail. Investigation of the structural properties of NCS by NMR spectroscopy can thus not only provide new information concerning the reaction mechanism of the enzyme, but is also expected to help clarify the long standing and heavily debated question on the physiological function as well as the reasons for the allergenic potential of members of the Bet v 1 allergen family.As the first important step towards the three-dimensional solution structure, we optimized expression of recombinant NCS in E. coli and established an efficient purification protocol yielding high amounts of pure isotopically labeled protein. Spectroscopic analysis by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy showed that the protein is properly folded with well defined secondary and tertiary structure, probably similar to that of its allergen homologue Bet v 1. In consequence, comparison of NCS and Bet v 1 concerning structural and allergenic properties might help to elucidate which structural features are important for the allergenicity of Bet v 1 allergens. Enzyme kinetics were investigated by monitoring substrate turnover using 1D-1 H-NMR. Additionally, NMR titration experiments with substrate analoga were carried out to characterize substrate binding.",

Background: Alternaria alternata is one of the mayor fungal antigen producers. The mayor allergen Alt a1 is expressed by Alternaria and other taxonomical species related. Aim: Analyze the correlation between Alternaria spores levels and Alt a1 in the atmosphere of Ciudad Real. Method: Daily spore concentrations were sampled daily during 2003 an 2004 using a Burkard volumetric spore trap. The total number of spores was expressed as n-spores/m3/day. An Air Sentinel and monoclonal binding were used to measure the mayor allergen Alt a1 (pgr/ml). Meteorological data of the years 2003 and 2004 were obtained. Results: A wide variety of fungal spores were compiled. Cladosporium was the most prevalent fungi (77%), followed by Alternaria (6,6%). The highest airbone Alternaria spp. spore concentration were obtained during spring and summer (may-june and august-september), with a decrease in july due to the high temperature (less than 100 spores/m3/day, as the rest of the months). Correlation may be established between the total spore counts and the atmospherical conditions (temperature 20Y30-and accumulate rainfall but not daily rainfall). Alt a1 levels are more homogeneous along the year. These are no correlated with spore counts. Conclusion: Fungal spore release is influenced by meteorological conditions.

It is a common opinion that recent increases in this pollinosis are due to extensive plantation of cypress trees, and the potential adjuvant effect of the chemical pollution generated by the urbanism. In Tehran, the perfect adaptation of cypress trees to climatic conditions, have led to large-scale plantation causing a significant augmentation of allergic diseases from the middle of winter to the beginning of spring.In this study, we tried to evaluate effects of air pollutants on pollen protein content of the Cupressus arizonica planted in the highest polluted areas of Tehran. Polluted areas of the city were selected according to data provided by Air Quality Control company. In the first sampling, pollens were collected just after microsporangia bursting, and the second sampling was conducted 2 weeks later, in order to permit a natural pollen exposure to the urban air pollution. After two weeks exposure to urban air pollution, the colour of purified pollens turned from a brillant yellow to a dark green. Bradford protein assay showed an important diminution of the total protein content in polluted pollens from 220 6g/ml to 150 6g/ml. Comparison of protein components of polluted and non-polluted pollen extracts via SDS-PAGE and densitometric analysis revealed appreciabe differences between their electrophoresis profiles. In non-polluted pollen extracts, a protein band with an approximate molecular weight at about 45 kDa, called Cup a 1, (known as the major allergen of C.arizonica pollens) represented 75% of all protein content France; 3 University Hospital of Montpellier, Exploration des Allergies, Services de Maladies re, Montpellier, France. Introduction: During drug hypersensitivity tests, cefuroxim, one of the most common beta-lactam used in France, is often tested either as the suspected drug or as an alternative. We report those tests and characterized patients with a positive test. Methods: Using our Drug Allergy and Hypersensitivity Database (DAHD), we conducted an historico-prospective cohort study. All patients who consulted between 1996 and 2007 for a suspected beta-lactam hypersensitivity reaction and who underwent at least skin tests to cefuroxim were included. Diagnosis (skin tests and challenges) followed the European Network on Drug allergy (ENDA) recommendations. Results: 650 patients [(188, 29 .1% of male), 107 (16.5%) asthmatics and 355 (54.6%) atopics] were tested. 38 (5.8%) had a clinical history involving cefuroxim, 17 (44.7%) urticaria / angioedema, 10 (26.3%) exanthema and 6 (15.6%) anaphylaxis / anaphylactic shock. Only 5 (13.2%) were positive (3 skin tests and 2 oral challenges). Among those tested as an alternative (612), 178 (29.2%) were positive to at least one beta-lactam. 10 (1.6%) of them were also positive to cefuroxim (3 skin tests and 7 challenges). The most common clinical presentations were urticaria / angioedema (4, 40%) or anaphylaxis / anaphylactic shock (4, 40%). Conclusion: 22.2% of patient with a drug allergy to beta-lactam, were positive to cefuroxim. Among those positive to the later one, 20,8% had no history involving this drug.",

Background: Confirmation of adverse drug reaction (ADR) is important for proper further drug management in patients with such reactions. The gold standard for diagnosis adverse drug reaction is drug challenge. Recently, adverse drug reactions as categorized by World Health Organization-The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system has been suggested as a practical tool for assessing and classifying adverse drug reactions (ADR). However, confirmation of such classification by complete allergic evaluation has been not previously studied. The objective in this study is to further evaluate ADR among Thai children reported with adverse drug reactions with the WHO-UMC system by complete allergic evaluation. Methods: Cases of ADR documented by WHO-UMC criteria between January 2005YJune 2006 at Siriraj hospital, Thailand were investigated by skin prick tests (SPT), intradermal test (ID) and challenges to drugs. Serum tryptase was measured in case of anaphylaxis. Results: Twenty-seven patients with mean age of 6.9 year were documented to have ADR by WHO-UMC criteria between January 2005YJune 2006. These patients were classified to have causality terms as certain in 4/27, probable in 6/27, possible in 10/27 and unlikely in 7/27 cases. Antibiotics were the most common drugs causing ADR in this group of patients (44.5%) which sulfonamides and beta-lactam drugs being the common culprits (18.5% and 14.9%, respectively). Skin tests and drug challenges were performed in 26 patients. Serum tryptase were measured in 3 patients with drug-induced anaphylaxis. Drug challenges and serum tryptase were positive in 8 and 1 patient, respectively. Overall, cases of certain and unlikely drug allergy were identified in 9/27 and 18/27, respectively. By performing drug challenges, the sensitivity and specificity were changed from 70% to 100% and 88.2% to 100% , respectively. Conclusion: Skin tests, drug challenges and serum tryptase are helpful to further confirmed adverse drug reactions among patients categorized by WHO-UMC system.",

Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were used as target cells, and cell proliferation was determined by [3H]-thymidine uptake. The results indicated a dose related change of proliferation in phytohemagglutinin activated cells. The extract at 0.1 to 10 6g/ml was stimulatory and at 100 to 200 6g/ml was inhibitory (p G 0.01). Immunization of the extract-treated mice with the antigen using delayed hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test and antibody measurement showed an increase in the footpad thickness which the amount reached to the level of the control when mice treated with more doses of the extract. The antibody titer in immunized mice treated with 1 mg/kg of the extract was higher than the non-treated mice, whereas treating mice with 100 mg/kg of the extract decreased the titer to under the level of the control in both primary and secondary response (p G 0.007). In flow cytometer analysis the presence of apoptotic cells in sub-G1 phase at higher concentrations of the extract in mitogen-treated human lymphocytes was observed. DNA fragmentation analysis confirmed the result of flow cytometry. In conclusion, these results indicates that immunomodulatory agents are present in the extract of S. mirzayanii and that the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes might be the mechanism responsible for the inhibitory effect of the extract observed at higher concentrations.",

Department of Environmental Medical Biology and Institute of Tropical Medicine, Brain Korea 21 Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Background: Several allergens from cockroach have been identified. The information on their B cell and T cell epitopes are limited, which are important for diagnostic and immunotherapeutic approaches. This study was conducted to analyze the linear IgE-binding epitopes of Bla g 5, a glutathione Stransferase homologous allergen, using recombinant proteins. Method: Full-length and five fragmented or truncated recombinant Bla g 5 were expressed (A, 1-100 amino acid residue; B, 91-201; Ba, 1-125; Bb, Bc, . IgE reactivities of the recombinant proteins to the cockroach-sensitized subjects were assessed by ELISA. Results: Twelve (37.5%) of 32 sera tested showed positive IgE reactivity to the full-length Bla g 5. Six serum samples were selected for the epitope study. Any recombinant proteins containing 1-175 amino acid residues were unable to bind human IgE while the full-length and B fragment were recognized by 6 sera tested. These results suggests that the C-terminal region between 176Y201 amino acid residues contains most of the IgE-binding sites.Conclusion: These findings will advance the understanding of the allergenicity of cockroach allergen, thereby contributing to the development of strategies for allergen specific immunotherapies.",

Department of Environmental Medical Biology and Institute of Tropical Medicine, Brain Korea 21 Project for Medical Science, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Background: Cockroaches cause various respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma. Although Bla g 2 is one of the most important cockroach allergens, researches on B cell and T cell epitopes of Bla g 2 have not been performed yet. This study was conducted to identify IgE-binding epitope of Bla g 2 by using recombinant proteins. Method: The full-length and five peptide fragments (A, aa 1-75; B, aa 71-150; C, aa 146-225; D, aa 221-300; E, aa 296-352) of Bla g 2 were generated by PCR and over-expressed in E. coli. IgE binding reactivity was compared with Pichia-expressed Bla g 2 (PrBla g 2) and E. coli-expressed Bla g 2 (rBla g 2) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). And the IgE binding reactivities of the full-length rBla g 2 and peptide fragments were measured by ELISA using 38 serum samples of from patients with cockroach allergies. Results: Half of 38 sera showed IgE reactivities to PrBla 2 and rBla g 2. And only two (5.3%) serum samples among them showed stronger reactivities to PrBla g 2 than rBla g 2, indicating that they are reactive to conformational or carbohydrate epitopes. All fragments showed IgE-binding reactivities (80% to A fragment, 50% to B, 100% to C, 30% to D, 40% to E). Especially, amino acid residues 1 to 75 and 146 to 225 are shown to be important for IgE-binding. Conclusion: Various IgE-binding patterns to Bla g 2 in individual patients' sera were observed. This information on IgE-binding epitope of Bla g 2 could be helpful for precise diagnosis and treatment of cockroach allergy.",

Background: Interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 have been recognized as proinflammatory cytokines involved in allergic inflammation. However, the role of these cytokines in children with wheezing is unclear. Thus, we determined IL-5 and IL-13 production by CD4+ T cells in children with wheezing in order to better understand the role of T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of wheezing disorders. Methods: This study was conducted on hospitalized wheezing patients. Wheezers may be atopic or nonatopic depending on the presence of immunoglobulin E specific to several common allergens. The control group comprised patients who were admitted for noninfectious and noninflammatory diseases. CD4+ T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of the patients and incubated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 72 hours. The levels of IL-5 and IL-13 in the cell culture supernatant were measured. Results: After stimulation with PHA, the CD4+ T cells of the atopic wheezers produced increased amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 with statistical significance (P G 0.017 and P G 0.002, respectively), while those of the nonatopic wheezers and controls did not. Conclusion: IL-5 and IL-13 production by the CD4+ T cells of wheezers could play a role in the pathogenesis of wheezing disorders in children.Introduction: Tracheobronchial amyloidosis is a rare condition, characterised by the deposition of amyloid plaques in the upper respiratory tract. Background: A 65 year old lady with pre-existing tracheobronchial amyloidosis presented to the emergency department with dyspnoea, cough and coryzal symptoms. On the second hospital day, she developed stridor and worsening hypoxia. Clinically there was no air entry in the right lung, and chest radiography confirmed collapse. The patient was intubated and ventilated and underwent emergency bronchoscopy. This demonstrated mucus plugging and blood in the right main bronchus, which was aspirated and washed out. The underlying mucosa was grossly oedematous and friable. After bronchoscopy the patient required ventilatory support but air entry in the right lung had increased significantly, and re-expansion was confirmed by chest radiography. This was accompanied by a marked improvement in oxygenation, and the patient was extubated 3 days later. Discussion: Amyloidosis can be defined as a diverse group of disorders that share a common aetiologyYthe extracellular deposition of protein in a pathological fibrillar, insoluble form. Localised AL amyloidosis has a predeliction for the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, and is frequently nodular in character. Systemic AL amyloidosis is associated with underlying monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia, and features widespread organ involvement. Gilmore et al outlined the main respiratory amyloid syndromes: parenchymal (subclassified into nodular and diffuse alveolar septal) laryngeal intrathoracic lymphadenopathy tracheobronchial. Tracheobronchial amyloidosis refers to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the upper respiratory tract, and is relatively rare. It occurs most frequently in a diffusely infiltrative form, although a nodular form also exists. Reduction in airway calibre is the main feature, with consequent atelectasis and recurrent pneumonia. Successful treatment of endobronchial lesions using Nd-YAG laser irradiation has been reported. External beam radiation is a relatively recent technique, and results in improvement in spirometry, symptoms and bronchoscopic appearance. Other treatment modalities include bronchoscopic resection, surgical resection, carbon dioxide laser ablation and stenting.",

University of Tehran, Microbiology and Immunology, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. Background: Alternaria alternata (A. alternata) is well-known as source of allergenic components in the cell wall and cytoplasm of conidia and hyphae that cause allergic asthma. Purpose: Purpose of this study was to purify the A. alternata antigens to evaluate the skin allergic reactions and specific anti-A. alternata IgE in asthmatic patients. Methods: Eighty-eight patients with asthma (46 male, 42 female) and 40 nonatopic cases were enrolled with sequential trials. Alternaria alternata antigens were prepared and then skin prick test (SPT) and dot-blotting assay were performed for all patients. Results: Positive SPT reactions were obtained on 70.5% of patients (P G 0.05). The males had more positive SPT reactions than female (P G 0.05). Using dotblotting test, specific anti-A. alternata IgE antibody was detected in 46 (52.3%) of patients and had strong positive responses to A. alternata antigens, but no specific IgE antibody was detected in control group (P G 0.05). However, 16 (18.2%) sera of patients showed weak positive IgE-dot blotting results, in respect to sex and age, no significant differences were observed. Conclusion: The results confirmed that different allergenic components of A. alternata may play an important role in producing signs of asthma in the sensitive patients.",

Background: We wanted to investigate the clinical characteristics of CRS patients with atopic and nonatopic asthma. Methods: Twenty-one atopic and 25 nonatopic asthma with CRS and 30 nonasthmatic CRS patients were enrolled in this study. The severity of asthma was evaluated and clinical parameters including the degree of nasal polyposis and disease extension, pre-and postoperative subjective symptoms, and surgical outcome evaluated with endoscopy. Results: The severity of asthma was about the same between the two asthma groups. While all groups showed improved rhinosinusitis symptoms, significantly more severe disease extension and poorer endoscopic surgical outcome was noticed in the nonatopic asthma group. No differences were found in other parameters. Conclusion: In this study, nonatopic asthma is supposed to make more hazardous effects on CRS disease extension and surgical outcome in patients with both asthma and CRS. Clinical implications: CRS patients with nonatopic patients have more possibilities of severe disease extension and poor surgical outcome, which should be kept in mind when interviewing the CRS patients.",

Objectives: Allergic disease in children has diverse characteristics & sensitization with age because of allergen, pathophysiologic and immunologic differences. There has been few reports regarding the changes of allergic sensitization with age in children with of allergic rhinitis in Korea, so we aimed to find out these changes by CAP test. Methods: A total of 464 children with allergic rhinitis were subjected to this study. They were classified by age groups into less than 3, 4~6, 7~9, 10~12, 13~15 and 16~18 year-old. All children underwent the CAP test(Fluroenzyme immunoassay) about two subtype of house dust mite, cat, dog, and grass, tree, and weed mixture allergen. Also we analyzed the total IgE. Results: Children with 10~12 ages had significantly higher specific IgE to house dust mite (D. pteronyssinus = 31.50 U/ml, D. farinae = 53.64 U/ml) and reactivity to multiple allergens than other age groups. There were positive correlation between age and ratio of sensitization to weed and tree mixture allergen but no correlations were not found in cat, dog, grass and mold allergen. Also Total IgE was significant difference between sex (Male: 451.05 U/ml, Female: 252.46 U/ml) but no significant changes with age. Conclusion: The sensitization in children with allergic rhinitis was changed with age in some allergens by CAP test.",

The tree is economically important as it yields fruit, sugar, alcoholic drinks etc. But this pollen was reported to be allergenic also. So after aerobiological studies we tried to do immunotherapy to the susceptible patients. A 2-year aerobiological suuvey in the northern suburb of Greater Calcutta was carried out with the help of a Burkard Volumetric Sampler. SPT was carried out with P. sylvestris pollen extract on adult respiratory allergic patients. 35 subjects with typical seasonal allergic rhinitis with/without bronchial asthma were selected. Symptom-medication score (based on questionnaire and patient`s diary) was correlated with pollen count as recorded in Burkard sampler. 18 subjects were recruited in immunotherapy (IT) group receiving regular injections containing standardized allergen extract and 17 were recruited to placebocontrolled (PC) group. Changes in the level of specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG4 were recorded at three months intervals. Measurement of skin wheal diameter, total IgE level and FEV1 were performed prior starting and after one month of finishing therapy schedule. The pollen grains of P. sylvestris were found to be airborne from January to March. Although the occurrence of the pollen in the air was seasonal, during the peak month, i.e., in February, it contributed 15.97% for the first year and 14.84% in the second year of the total aeropollen load. 44.07% of the total patients showed positive reaction in SPT. The IT group showed 33.5% and 57% decrease in symptom-medication score during the first and second treatment season respectively. This group showed a significant decrease of skin-reactivity to PS pollen extract & specific IgE, significant increase in FEV1, specific IgG1 (1.95Y3.2 times) & IgG4 (21.24Y30.83 times) and no significant changes in total IgE level. In case of PC group, no significant changes were recorded for all the mentioned parameters excluding the development of new sensitization in two cases against Saccharum officinarum (Poaceae) pollen grain and Alternaria spore respectively. Phoenix sylvestris pollen are airborne and they cause respiratory allergy to the susceptible patients. Allergen immunotherapy with standardized PS pollen extract is effective in seasonal respiratory allergic subjects susceptible to PS pollen with narrow range of sensitization.",

Surendranath College, Botany, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.Intense occupational exposure to a number of mould spores or their fragments for brief or prolonged periods may be responsible for serious health hazards. This had been the case with the workers of the Potato Cold Stores in West Bengal. So the basic purpose of the present investigation was first to assess the qualitative and quantitative estimation of the aeromycoflora of the cold stores, to determine their allergenic potentialities to incite respiratory diseases among the workers and also deterioration of the food grains. Burkard personal Sampler and Andersen two stage sampler was used for this investigation. Diagnosis of respiratory allergic disorders was based on detailed medical history followed by skin-Prick test (SPT). A total of 20 fungal spore types were recorded during the survey period of two years (July'2005 to June'2007) with the dominance of Aspergillus niger (21.73%), Curvularia lunata (19.13%), Echinobotryum (15.96%), Alternaria alternata (13.06%), Fusarium solani (5.78%), and Rhizopus nigricans (2.45%) etc.,from the store houses. Clinical investigation of the susceptible workers with the antigenic extracts of the six dominant spore types using Skin Prick Test method clearly demonstrated their variable allergic potency. Among the 126 patients tested the highest positive reaction (2+ or more intensity) was noted in Aspergillus niger (26.98%) followed by Rhizopus nigricans (21.42%), Alternaria alternata (19.84%), Curvularia lunata (19.04%), Fusarium solani (18.25%), etc. Allergenic symptoms were pronounced during monsoon and summer season or whenever, there was prolonged disruption of power supply. High frequency of positive response to SPT was due to an increased prevalence of allergic fungal forms in the working environment, which can be attributed to poor post-harvest storage and scientific management of the store houses. The results obtained showed that the work environment was considerably polluted with the spores of fungi of allergenic and immunotoxic properties, which cause a high degree of health risk to people employed in that area. Determination of total and specific IgE response in allergic rhinitis patients of Kashmir Valley-India Allergy accounts for a substantial number of human diseases with significant morbidity to patients. Kashmir valley has been witnessing an increase in allergy related disorders usually due to aeroallergens present in the environment mostly during spring and autumn seasons. The present study was aimed at finding total and specific IgE responses in serum sample of 250 patients, reporting to various health centers across the valley with symptoms of seasonal allergy. Samples were first screened for the total IgE levels by a sandwich ELISA method. All the samples showed presence of high levels of total IgE (650Y1200 iu/ml). Specific IgE levels were determined using grass and tree mix antigens by a two step capture ELISA method. After recording the concentration of total and specific IgE levels of 250 serum samples, 97 patients having severe symptoms of allergic rhinitis complaints were tested clinically by intra-dermal antigen skin test method for different allergens like pollen (18 types), insect (1 type), dust (5 types), fungi (5 types) and epithelia (2 types) . 187 samples (74.80 %) out of 250 were reactive for the allergens used in the present study. Specific IgE ranged from 1.1Y75.0 iu/ml representing moderate to high specific IgE levels. 63 samples not reactive to the allergens used above but had high total IgE levels were probably due to other allergens which are further being evaluated. The skin test reactions were interpreted and graded at 15 Y 20 minutes as per the criteria of Shivpuri (1974).",

Results: Of population studies have been contradictory and some epidemiological studies showed the risk of pet keeping, some even suggesting that keeping pets decreased the risk of sensitization and asthma. Purpose: This study was to determine the association between pet ownership and asthma. Methods: A case-control study was conducted among 215 asthmatic participants referred to Children Medical Center in Tehran in a 2 year period and were asked to reply a questionnaire in concerning to kind of pet, its sex and puberty, the place of keeping it, duration of keeping and the aim of pet keeping. Cases were recruited and matched (age and sex) with 215 healthy controls. Statistical analysis performed to calculate Odds Ratio (OR) of asthma morbidity in individuals who had kept pets. Results: Odds ratio of asthma morbidity in patients who had kept pets was 2.59, CI=1.60Y4.21 and P90.001. Financial aim was the most reason of pet keeping (18.1%) and the most of pets were mature and were kept outdoor (41.7%). Pet keeping duration was less than 6 months (87.6%). No difference between genders was observed. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that pet ownership is an important risk factor for asthma. We suggest that individuals who are at the risk of asthma (Atopic individuals) must avoid contacting with pets. However more research in this field in Iran is necessary.",

In particular, it is not known whether patients actually follow guideline treatment, and if not, why not. Methods: To address these questions, a survey was conducted via an online panel with 321 randomly selected, representative adults in Germany and France who were diagnosed with CU. The survey included the Skindex-29 questionnaire on quality of life and questions about treatment and patientsr elation to their physician. Treatment was compared with recommendations from the current GA 2 LEN/EAACI/EDF guidelines. Results: The survey confirmed that CU has substantial impact on patient quality of life. Notably, half the respondents were only Bsomewhat satisfied\u0175 ith their treatment of their CU and considered their physician only Bsomewhat knowledgeable.^Only 64% of the respondents were using prescription medications as recommended by guidelines. Notably, 62% of respondents reported that they avoid seeing their physician unless absolutely necessary.Conclusion: This survey implies that physicians either do not fully understand the experience of many of their patients with CU or are not building trustworthy supporting relations with them. Physicians need to talk with these patients more about how the condition impacts their lives and feelings in order to improve their compliance with treatment guidelines.",

After 15 minutes ,when beginning the surgical incision and coinciding with the start of intravenous infusion of the following drugs: cefazolin, ketorolac, ranitidine and ondasentron, a sudden severe bronchospasm appeared, followed by cardiovascular collapse with severe hemodynamic deterioration, which was treated immediately with i.v. corticoids and ephedrine without an effective response. The surgical procedure was interrupted and ,now with suspicions of a possible allergic reaction, all of the drugs that were being administered were withdrawn, i.v. adrenaline was administered up to a total of 1 mgr., forcing fluid resuscitation with crystalloids and colloids.The shock was reversed in approximately 5 minutes. The surgical procedure resumed 20 minutes after the symptoms, with clinical stability subsequently maintained. The immediate study revealed a high serum tryptase level 30 minutes and 6 hours following the reaction,the allergy study showed a decidedly positive prick test for cephalosporins, and the intradermal reaction was positive for cefazolin. The diagnosis was anaphylactic shock due to the administration of cefazolin and hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.",

Background: This study designed to evaluate the role of swimming in mechanics of lung in healthy individual and patients with asthma. Methods: A total 76 girls who take part in course of regular swimming session three day per week for eight weeks enrolled in this study. All of them completed International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood written questionnaire and person who suspicious to asthma or other atopic diseases referred to allergist for more evaluation. Peak expiratory flow rate was recorded for participants at beginning, one hour after swimming and two months later. Results: According to International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood questionnaire 35.4% had asthma or other atopic diseases Increase in Peak expiratory Flow rate more than 20% of personal best was seen in 21.9% after one hour swimming and in 27.6% after two months Increased in Peak expiratory Flow rate was significant in healthy individual and asthmatic patients and obese but not significant in patients with allergic rhinitis or eczema. Conclusion: Swimming in indoor chlorinated pool not only is less asthmogenic but also can improve lung mechanics in normal and asthmatic patients. Because breathing large volume of warm and moist air are good for lung. The serious health problem with chlorinated pools is too much chlorine uses to sanitize the water and don`t have adequate ventilation in indoor pool. Are fast foods and additives main culprit of increasing atopy? Background: Frequency of atopic disease increased in last 3 decades and hypothesis explained for this, among several factors that could be related to increasing frequency of atopic disease. Using additives and fast food have the more important role, so this study designed for checking this purpose. Methods: 110 patients with atopic disease according to history and physical exam and Para clinic study such as total IgE, skin prick test and spirometry, compare with 110 normal healthy match group for using fast food, additives and habitual diet. Results: In case group 46.4% had allergic rhinitis and 34.5% had asthma. Pizza was the most culprit in flare up allergic symptoms (9.1%), and the most symptoms that exaggerated with fast foods was cough (29.5%) and the next one was flare up of skin manifestation such as itching or Urticaria. The diet with out curry and additive causes fewer symptoms in atopic patients and healthy individuals. Conclusion: Fast foods and additives can increase and exaggerate symptoms of atopic patient, they have important role in triggering allergic symptoms in patients with atopic back ground.",

Rimini Hospital, Internal Medicine Department, Rimini, Italy.Of note the mastocytosis is an important factor of risk for severe anaphylaxis, in particular from Hymenoptera stings. There is very few documentation about anaphylaxis with bifasic course during stings. Equally multiple Hymenoptera stings do not seem to affect additional risk for anaphylactic reactions. Case report: Male, 65 years old with anamnesis of urticaria pigmentosa. In the past we observed urticaria angioedema after assumption of FANS and assumption of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. During the last years of observation the patient present recurrent abdominal pain, headache and flashes. He came in hospital after 5 vespides stings, with immediate symptoms of diffused erythema, dyspnoea and loss of conscience, for a long time. He was discharged after 6 hours of observation. After 12 hours from the multiple stings he showed relapse of diffuse erythema and dyspnoea, that due to a new recovery.We found Positive Skin tests for polistes Dominulus to 0.1 mcg; Positive RAST to 1,23 KU. Tryptase 39,5 ng/ml. He now still presents clinician symptoms of systemic mastocytosis with presence of 1 minor criterion. The patient is now attending of bone marrow diagnostyic biopsy to confirmation. The venom immunotherapy with Polistes dominulus venom has been assigned to the dose of 200 mcg and well tolerated from the patient. It would be possible that multiple hymenoptera stings and systemic mastocytosis had caused a reaction with severe symptoms and biphasic course.",

Background: Medical literature regarding the relationship between infant feeding practices and the development of childhood asthma and allergic diseases is conflicting with hardly any studies from developing countries. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between breast-feeding (BF) and the development of childhood asthma, recurrent wheezing, and allergic diseases after adjustment for maternal asthma. Design: This is a cross sectional survey. Setting: Immunization Centre and Pediatric Department at the 11 Primary Health Care Centers and Hamad General Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, State of Qatar. Subjects: A multistage sampling design was used and a representative sample of 1500 infants and pre-school children with age range of 0Y5 years and mothers aged between 18 to 47 years were surveyed during the period from October 2006 to September 2007 in Qatar. A total of 1278 mothers (85.2%) made consent to participate in this study. Methods: A confidential, anonymous questionnaire was completed by the selected subjects assessing BF and allergic diseases. Questionnaires were administered to women who were visiting Primary Health Centers for immunization of their children. Questionnaire included asthma, recurrent wheezing allergic rhinitis. Additional questions included breast feeding and duration, passive tobacco exposure, number of siblings, family income, level of maternal education, family history of allergies. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were performed for statistical analysis. Results: Out of the 1500 child mothers, 1278 mothers agreed to participate in this study with the response rate of 85.2%. More than half of infants 758(59.3%) initially were exclusively breastfed and followed by partial breastfed (29.9%) and formula fed (10.8%). Length of breastfeeding was associated with maternal age. Of these infants, prevalence of allergic diseases in general and asthma (15.6%) allergic rhinitis (22.6%), and wheezing (12.7%) were significantly less frequent in those with prolonged and exclusive BF. The association between breastfeeding and asthma tended to be similar in children with positive family history of asthma (pG0.001) and allergic rhinitis (pG0.001) compared children without. Conclusion: The current study indicated that exclusive BF has protective effect against asthma and allergic diseases. Educated women were aware of the importance of the BF. The study findings suggested possible avenue for intervention to increase awareness and increase of BF. Stressing the practice of BF could be one of effective measures directed against development childhood asthma and allergic diseases in third world countries.",

Ehlayel 1 and Abdulbari Bener 2 . 1 Hamad Medical Corporation, Department of Pediatrics Allergy and Immunology, Hamad, Qatar; 2 Hamad Medical Corporation, Department of Medical Statistics & Epideiology, Hamad, Qatar. Background: Prolonged breast-feeding (BF) was shown to reduce the risk of diseases. In 2001 the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a revised global recommendation that mother should breast feed exclusively for six months. This recommendation is likely to influence national policies on the recommended age for the first introduction of solids, so it is important that pediatricians are aware of the issues and the evidence (or lack of it) on which the WHO recommendation is based. The fact that BF may protect against allergic disease remains controversial, with hardly any reports from developing countries. Aim: The aim of this study to determine whether the protective effect of longer breast-feeding on the risk of allergic diseases and eczema. Design: This is a cross sectional survey. Setting: Immunization Centre and Pediatric Department at the 11 Primary Health Care Centers and Hamad General Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, State of Qatar.

Methods: A confidential, anonymous questionnaire was completed by the selected subjects assessing BF and allergic diseases. Questionnaires were administered to women who were visiting Primary Health Centers for immunization of their child. Questionnaire included allergic rhinitis, wheezing, eczema, and additional questions included breast feeding and duration, tobacco smoke exposure, number of siblings, family income, level of maternal education, and family history atopy. Univariate and multivariate statistical methods were performed for statistical analysis. Results: Out of the 1278 infants included in the study, more than half of infant 758(59.3) initially were exclusively breastfed. Length of BF was associated with maternal age [29.1T5.6, meanTSD].

The association between BF and eczema tended to be similar in children positive family history of atopy (pG0.001) and eczema (pG0.001) compared to those without. Conclusion: This study confirms that prolonged duration of BF has protective effect against development of allergic diseases and eczema in children.

Esophagitis has been shown in 30%Y50% of patients with typical symptoms of heartburn. Nonesophageal manifestations of the regurtation of gastric contents promotes the use of the term extraesophageal reflux. EER should be considered in patient. We aimed to investigate the prevelance of GER and laryngopharengeal reflux (LFR) symptoms in asthmatic patients and to determine the contribution of the laboratory findings (endoscopic evaluation and pulmonary function test) to the symptom based diagnosis. Materials and Methods: We investigated 37 asthmatics patients having primary reflux symptoms; heartburn and regurtation. At the same time we asked other gastroesophageal and laryngopharengeal reflux symptoms. We performed pulmonary function test and pulmonary carbon monoxide diffusion test to all of the patients. All of asthmatic patients with GER were performed esophagogastrodoudenoscopy by gastroenterologist and laryngoscopy by ENR phycisian. All statistics were performed by using UNISTAT 5.1 statistics pack program. Results: Heartburn frequency was daily in 28.1%, a few days in a week in 18.8% and once a week in 26.6% of the patients. Regurtgitation was occuring daily in 34.4% and once a week in 23.4% of the cases. 34.4% of the cases were complaining of daily globus. FVC percentage was lower in severe cases when compared to mild regurgitation (p=0.024). CO monoxide diffusion capacity did not have a statistical difference according to severity of the symptoms. The pulmonary diffusion capacity of obese cases were lower than the cases with BMI G 29 (p=0.038). Reflux esophagitis in 24 of cases were also confirmed with pathological diagnosis. Avarage refllux finding score (RFS) was calculated as 5.2T4.15(min 0Ymax 15). Posterior comissure hypertrophy was the most common finding 72%. Conclusion: Laryngoscopic findings and RFS did not help in diagnosis. We determined that reflux symptoms did not have any effect on reflux esophagitis. Diffusion capacity changes result from high body mass index. Conducting controlled studies with different diagnostic methods and a larger number of case series which will contribute to the symptom based reflux diagnosis are needed.",

Background: Recent evidence suggests that a chronic microbial trigger might play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (NP). For treatment, doxycyline was selected based on its antimicrobial effect and anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of oral doxycycline on nasal polyp size, nasal peak inspiratory flow (nPIF), signs and symptoms of nasal polyps. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter study, 32 subjects with bilateral nasal polyps were randomized to receive placebo or antibiotics at a dose of 200 mg doxycycline at day one, followed by 100 mg doxycycline from day two till day 20. The effect was assessed by endoscopic evaluation of polyp size, symptoms, peripheral eosinophil counts, local IgE, MPO, MMP-9 and ECP levels. Results: Doxycline treatment resulted in a significant decrease of the endoscopic nasal polyp score after 4 to 12 weeks after the start of the doxycline treatment compared to placebo. The concentrations of IgE, MPO, MMP-9 and ECP decreased significantly in nasal secretions of doxycycline treated patients. Conclusion: This is first study demonstrating the positive clinical effect of doxycyline on nasal polyposis, paralleled by a sign impact on markers of local inflammation and remodelling. Further, in a clinical setting the use of doxycycline offers an additional advantage of providing both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects resulting in a decrease in nasal polyp size.",
