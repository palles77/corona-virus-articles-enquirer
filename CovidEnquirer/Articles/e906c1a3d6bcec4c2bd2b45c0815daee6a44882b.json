This alien intruder, known as a provirus or proviral DNA, then is replicated whenever host-cell division takes place and can serve as a template for the intracellular production of new virus particles. The new virions are assembled in the cytoplasm of the cell and are released at the cell membrane, where they acquire a lipid envelope and glycoprotein surface receptors (peplomers). A cell infected with a retrovirus is infected essentially for the duration of its existence, as are all of its daughter cells. 26 Because a version of their genetic material becomes a part of the total genetic information of the cells they infect, retroviruses are among the most intimate parasites known in nature.",

            "text": "Cats are susceptible to natural infection with at least three members of the Retroviridae family : FeLV, FeSV (the feline sarcoma virus), and a virus known as RD-1l4. Of these, only FeLV is a truly exogenous agent-that is, infection is spread from cat to cat as a contagion. FeSVs, replication-defective mutants of FeLV, apparently arise within individual cats by recombination when a small piece of chromosomal DNA is erroneously incorporated into an FeLV provirus. The resulting FeSV is unable to replicate without \"assistance\" from replication-competent FeLV (\"helper\" virus) because a portion of its genetic information is lost during recombination. In nature, FeSV recombinational events apparently occur infrequently, and the recombinant viruses are probably not contagious per se. 17 The virus known as RD-1l4 is a true endogenous virus. That is, multiple RD-1l4 proviruses are present within the chromosomal DNA of all cells of all domestic cats and are transmitted vertically through the germline. However, production of virus is usually repressed, so that the agent is not contagious. The RD-1l4 retrovirus does not appear to be related to FeLV or FeSV and has not been proven to cause any recognized disease in cats. 16 Immunogenic Significance of Major FeLV Structural Components Individual particles of FeLV consist of two distinct morphologic components: a dense inner core, or nucleoid, and an outer envelope containing an immunogenically important 70-kilodalton glycoprotein, gp70. This glycoprotein is the prinCipal antigen present in the viral peplomers, which are responsible for attachment of the virus to cells during infection. Virusneutralizing antibody (VNA) directed . against gp70 is an essential component of a successful immunologic response to FeLV, and the presence of this antibody in serum is an indication of past FeLV exposure. 9 Most persistently viremic cats produce little or no VNA. Most healthy cats in the general feline population also have little or no VNA, but only because they have not been exposed to an infective dose of FeLV. By contrast, about 40 to 50 per cent of healthy, exposed cats have protective levels of VNA. Such cats are generally believed to be resistant to subsequent FeLV infection, and most will not become persistently viremic. 9 , 16, 30 A 27-kilodalton protein moiety, p27, is a structural component of the inner viral core and is the major FeLV group-specific antigen. 16 It can be found in great abundance in the cytoplasm of infected leukocytes and platelets, and in soluble form in plasma and serum of viremic cats. This protein provides the major antigenic basis for both the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IF A) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for FeLV. The signifcance of the immunologic response to p27 itself is at present uncertain, because antibody directed against it is not protective and prevents neither viremia nor Fe LV-related disease. 10 Suppression of normal protective immunologic responses is one of the most important consequences of persistent FeLV infection. Both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system are affected by the virus. 22. 45. 54 A major cause of FeLV-induced immunosuppression appears to be a specific FeLV structural protein, p15(E), that is associated with the viral envelope. 39 Both intact as well as disrupted (inactivated) virus particles retain immunosuppressive capabilities. 22 The significance of Fe LV-induced immunosuppression is especially apparent when one considers the array of ~econdary diseases associated with FeLV infection. 16 In addition, immunosuppression mediated by pI5(E), even from \"inactivated\" virus, is a major consideration in the design of a safe and efficacious FeLV vaccine.",

Many cats that ultimately develop immunity expt \u00b7rience an initial transient viremia lasting from 1 to 2 days or up to several months, during which time they can excrete infectious FeLV from the oropharynx. 30 . 31 Excretion of FeLV in persistently viremic cats occurs primarily by way of salivary secretions, although virus may also be present in respiratory secretions, milk, feces, and urine. 16. 19 Thus, the social grooming habits of cats, biting, sneezing, and the urban practice of sharing litter boxes and feeding bowls probably represent the major modes of spread of FeLV among pet cats. In addition, in utero transfer of virus across the placenta and excretion in colostrum are also known to occur, so that kittens may become infected either through an infected queen or by close contact with other persistently viremic cats. IS. 32 Prolonged close contact (days to weeks) between cats is usually required for effective transmission of FeLV. Thus, asocial cats that participate little in \"group activities\" appear to be less readily infected than more \"outgoing\" cats.14 Virus can also be spread in blood transfusions from viremic cats and possibly also by hematophagous arthropods. The time period between initial exposure to an infective dose of FeLV and the development of either persistent viremia or immunity is quite variable and may be dependent in part upon the route of virus transmission. 14 In common with a number of other enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, FeLV is extremely unstable once outside the cat and is rapidly inactivated by warm, dry environmental conditions and by most common household detergents and disinfectants. Infectivity of virus in saliva left to dry at room temperature has been shown to decline to inconsequential levels within 3 to 4 hours. 12 However, infectivity of FeLV in liquid suspension at room temperature may persist for several days and for even longer periods at refrigerator temperatures. Detection of Viral Antigens. 30, 31 In the last several years, comparative studies of FeLV antigen detection tests have identified some cats that remain positive by ELISA but negative by IF A or by virus isolation for many months. 23. 32, 36, 37 As many as 30 per cent of cats positive by ELISA may be negative by one or both of the other methods. 32 Tests performed 1 to 10 months after initial testing have shown that the FeLV status of most of these cats remains unchanged. 32, 36, 37 The cellular source of the FeLV antigen causing the persistently positive ELISA results has not yet been definitely identified. The most recently published studies indicate that persistently ELISA-positive, IFA-negative cats, unlike their persistently IF A-positive counterparts, do not give birth to infected kittens and do not appear to be excreting FeLV. 30 , 32 Tentatively, then, the following cautious recommendation may be made: Until further research should prove otherwise, cats remaining persistently ELISA-positive and IF A-negative for a period of at least 3 months may be considered free of infectious FeLV.30, 32, 37 However, studies have not progressed for a long enough period to determine whether these cats are still at risk to develop one or more of the Fe LV-related diseases.",

Thus, even in multiple-cat households and catteries where FeLV is endemic, apparently only a minority of exposed cats (estimated to be about 30 per cent) fail to overcome the infection and instead proceed to develop persistent viremia. 16 However, recent studies have shown that many recovered cats develop a persistent infection of myelomonocytic precursor cells in the bone marrow and of certain nodal T lymphocytes. 3s \u2022 49 Thus, \"FeLV-negative\" cats are not necessarily free of FeLV. Healthy FeLV-negative cats that lack both VNA and FOCMA antibody have probably never been exposed to an infective dose of FeLV and thus are truly free of the virus. VNA and/or FOCMA antibody in healthy Fe LV-negative cats, however, are the telltale \"footprints\" of previous FeLV exposure and, in light of the new data, probably indicate, in many cases, the existence of latent FeLV proviral infection. In addition, some cats with Fe LV-negative LSA have been shown to harbor latent FeLV infections in the bone marrow. 49 Cats latently infected with FeLV are not viremic and, thus, do not shed infectious FeLV into their environment. However, administration of corticosteroids can reactivate latent infections, with re-emergence of FeLV into the bloodstream (and reversion to FeLV-positive status/ 6 \u2022 49 Blood smears from such cats usually contain Fe LV-infected cells as determined by IFA, but plasma samples may be negative by ELISA, suggesting that most extracellular virus is complexed with antibody and, thus, not available for ELISA detection. 46 Because corticosteroid release from the adrenal glands is a natural physiologic response of animals to stress, it seems reasonable to suspect that certain stressful situations in the day-to-day existence of modern cats, such as overcrowding, movement to new quarters, territorial conflicts, pregnancy and lactation, improper nutrition, and perhaps intercurrent diseases, may serve to reactivate latent FeLV infections in nature. This might explain occasionally observed instances when a cat with a long history of negative FeLV tests in an FeLV-negative, closed cattery suddenly becomes FeLV-positive. The virus may not have come from the outside; it may have been present in the cat all along.",

This indicates that exposure of cats to coronavirus(es) is much more widespread than was once believed, especially in certain selected populations.

Both retrospective and prospective studies support this hypothesis. Using the KELA, a statistical association between recent vaccination and the presence of this noncoronavirus reactivity has been demonstrated. 3 However, not all cats reacted to vaccination this way, nor did all vaccines always produce this reactivity. KELA studies have shown further that this reactivity dissipates with time and that the probability of encountering it (and hence of producing an inaccurate coronavirus antibody titer) can be minimized if serum samples for elective serotesting are drawn no sooner than three to four months afte r the most recent parenteral vaccination. 3 General Recommendations. The presence of serum coronavirus antibody in any cat, whether healthy or diseased, is indicative only of exposure to a coronavirus in the FIPV antigenic group. A positive coronavirus antibody titer, while consistent with a clinical diagnosis of FIP (recall that this type of FIP diagnosis is always presumptive), does not indicate that a cat actually has FIP, because many healthy cats and many cats with diseases other than FIP are also coronavirus antibody-positive. Neither does a positive titer indicate that a cat is protected against FIP, because most cats with FIP are also coronavirus antibody-positive. Considering that FIP occurs only sporadically in the general feline population and that most cats in FIP-problem households are coronavirus antibody-positive and yet do not contract FIP, it would appear that many cats (perhaps most cats) with coronavirus antibody are protected against the natural disease. The question remains whether it is coronavirus antibody (of some type) that actually confers this protection or whether other unknown factors are involved. Lastly, present-day coronavirus antibody tests have absolutely no predictive value; a positive titer in no way indicates that a cat is doomed to develop FIP at some future date.",

Based on our current understanding of feline coronaviral serology, screening would appear to be the major use for coronavirus antibody testing today. Screening of cats in a household experiencing undiagnosed disease problems may be especially useful. Only about 10 to 20 per cent of the cats (a minimum number of three) in such a household need to be tested, because antibody will either be totally absent or present in 80 to 90 per cent of the animals. Although the discovery of coronavirus antibody-positive cats in such households will not diagnose the problem, knowledge that coronavirus antibody is absent is helpful in ruling out an FIPV-group coronavirus as the culprit.",
