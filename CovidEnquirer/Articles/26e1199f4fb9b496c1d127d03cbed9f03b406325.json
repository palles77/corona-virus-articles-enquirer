However, comprehensive data on sensitivity, specificity and performance of the multiplex PCR compared to the single target PCR's is limited for most published respiratory multiplex real time PCR assays. Objectives: Development and extensive analysis of an internally controlled multiplex real time rt-PCR for detection of respiratory viruses. Study design: The assay was validated in comparison to single-target PCR's using plasmid targets and prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: Using plasmid targets the multiplex format was found to be as least as sensitive and specific as the single-target PCR and no competition was observed when different targets were present at different amounts in one tube. Clinical validation showed high concordance for all viruses tested except for samples with low levels of enterovirus. Conclusion: This multiplex showed excellent specificities for all 14 respiratory viruses and sensitivity was high except for clinical samples with low levels of enterovirus.",

            "text": "Demonstrating the presence of a viral pathogen in patients with respiratory symptoms has long been challenging. Traditional methods like viral culture and antigen detection have moderate sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the relative long turnaround time for some of these techniques makes them less useful for diagnosis of acute clinical problems. With the development of real time (RT) reverse transcriptase (rt) PCR, direct detection of amplified nucleic acids became possible, minimizing cross-contamination and reducing hands on time. In addition, RT rtPCR provides the possibility of easy quantitation of the amplified target. This progress has led to the development of a large number of rtPCR assays for the detection of individual viral pathogens. The introduction of multiplex RT rtPCR assay has increased the efficiency of routine molecular diagnostics of respiratory viruses and has been shown to be cost effective. [1] [2] [3] Past studies have extensively proven superior sensitivity of (real time) multiplex PCR over traditional methods. [4] [5] [6] However comprehensive analysis of analytical sensitivity and specificity of a multiplex PCR as compared to single-target assays has not been described for respiratory viruses. Puppe et al. 7 compared a multiplex assay with corresponding single-target PCR assays and showed a mean loss of 1.3 log for the multiplex assay. However their PCR was qualitative and did not use a real time format. Gunson et al. 8 reported similar median crossing-point (Cp) values when comparing duplex versus triplex real time assays.",

In addition, the presence of multiple targets in one reaction may result in competition for enzymes and nucleotides. Analysis of dynamic ranges and mixed input of plasmids, revealed no loss of sensitivity. In fact, for most viruses Cp-values were slightly, but significantly, lower in the multiplex analyses. Most likely, this difference is due to the algorithm used by the LC480 software to calculate crossing point. The LC480 software calculates the second derivatives of the entire amplification curve and determines where this value is at its maximum. This value is the Cp-value and represents the cycle at which the increase of fluorescence is highest (i.e. the start logarithmic phase of the PCR). Using Cp values by the second derivative maximum of the amplification curve is known to be more precise than cycle thresholds values or other crossing point algorithms. 12 We have observed that in our multiplex reactions the total fluorescence is slightly lower and the slope of the amplification curve is less steep as compared to the corresponding single-target PCR's (which is most likely due to inevitable minute differences in PCR reaction mixtures of singleplex versus multiplex pcr's). This difference could lead to slightly lower Cp-values for the multiplex reactions, but does not represent a difference in absolute sensitivity.",

For InfA, hCoV, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV 4, hMPV, AdV and hPeV Cp-values were nearly identical for multiplex and single-target assays. However for certain viruses (InfB, PIV 1, 2, 3 & 4, hPeV, and hCoV) the number of clinical samples was relatively small and extensive comparisons could be merely performed in the mixed input of plasmids analysis, but not by clinical samples. For RSV, RV and InfB multiplex showed slightly lower Cp-values than the single target PCR, particularly when single-target Cp-values were \u226530. This is probably due to a comparable phenomenon as described for slightly lower multiplex Cp-values in the plasmid evaluation. Discrepancies in clinical samples were mostly seen for hBoV and EV. Samples with a very low hBoV load (Cp-value > 36) were variable positive in either multiplex or single-target assay. This seems to represent a stochastic process around the detection limit for both multiplex and singletarget assays. Most of the EV positive respiratory samples, with Cp-values higher than 33 in single-target assays were negative in the multiplex assay, suggesting reduced sensitivity of EV detection of our multiplex assay. Additional analysis of dilution series of 4 different EV subtypes (representing group A, B, C and D EV's) showed concordant results for EV Cp-values in the multiplex and the singleplex assay (data not shown). However the fluorescence plateau's of the EV multiplex assay was notably lower compared to its singleplex equivalent. It might be possible that in samples with low abundance of multiple viral targets this lower fluorescence could lead to false-negativity. In this respect, it is noteworthy that all clinical EV samples that were \"missed\" by the multiplex PCR were samples positive two or three respiratory viruses (Table 4) .",

Since then, we have also tested the EV PCR against a panel of RV type C virus isolates (N = 9) which showed absent of cross reactivity against these viruses as well. Morever extensive in silico analysis (data not shown) did not show cross reactivity between our EV primers and RV sequences. However, as RV comprises over a hundred subtypes we cannot completely rule out cross reactivity with less common HRV strains. In literature cross-reactivity of molecular test between rhinovirus and enterovirus is not uncommon 13 and some authors even suggest that complete specificity for Rhinovirus and Enterovirus in impossible. 14 Yet the ongoing discovery of new respiratory EV's implies that separate analyses of EV in respiratory samples is of clinical importance 15 and optimization RV and EV pcr specificity is an important topic for future study.",
