            "text": "During Drosophila oogenesis, the localization and translational regulation of maternal transcripts relies on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Many of these RBPs localize several mRNAs and may have additional direct interaction partners to regulate their functions. Using immunoprecipitation from whole Drosophila ovaries coupled to mass spectrometry, we examined protein-protein associations of 6 GFP-tagged RBPs expressed at physiological levels. Analysis of the interaction network and further validation in human cells allowed us to identify 26 previously unknown associations, besides recovering several well characterized interactions. We identified interactions between RBPs and several splicing factors, providing links between nuclear and cytoplasmic events of mRNA regulation. Additionally, components of the translational and RNA decay machineries were selectively co-purified with some baits, suggesting a mechanism for how RBPs may regulate maternal transcripts. Given the evolutionary conservation of the studied RBPs, the interaction network presented here provides the foundation for future functional and structural studies of mRNA localization across metazoans. : bioRxiv preprint Interactome of RNA Binding Proteins from Drosophila ovaries 5 consistent with the role of their mammalian homologs (38, 50-52). During early oogenesis, both Vas and Nos are involved in the maintenance of germline stem cells, in oocyte differentiation and other aspects of oocyte development (26, 35, 53-56). In embryos, Nos functions in germline development (53, 57-61) and further promotes the inclusion of germline cells in the developing ovary (53, 62). In addition to oogenic processes, Nos and Stau are also involved in the development of the Drosophila nervous system (63, 64). Many RBPs in Drosophila oogenesis have overlapping functions that are likely differentially regulated. Little is known about this regulation and it may involve several as yet unidentified mRNP components. To comprehensively identify RBP interactors, we carried out a systematic in vivo purification screen of GFPtagged RBPs coupled with mass spectrometry. We employed both labeled and label-free MS methods and identified several proteins significantly enriched with the purified RBPs. The interactomes of the individual RBPs were largely independent with some overlap. Our screen identified several previously unknown interactions, many of which we validated in vitro. This work presents an extended interaction network of RBPs in Drosophila, offering a new reference point for future functional and structural studies of mRNA localization. Experimental procedures Cloning and DNA constructs For cloning purposes, total RNA was extracted from wild-type ovaries using TRI-Reagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MuLV) reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in the presence of oligo (dT)15 primers. To express proteins in human HEK293 cells, genes of interest were amplified from Drosophila cDNA, or in some cases from the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (DGRC) clones, using the standard PCR conditions. Accession numbers of all the genes cloned are provided in Table S1. Fragments were cloned into mammalian expression vectors based on pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), bearing an N-terminal EGFP tag or modified to contain either HA or HA-Flag tags (provided by Elisa Izaurralde, MPI T\u00fcbingen). Full-length cDNAs were cloned, except for protein Nucampholin (Ncm), where a sequence encoding amino acids 359-664 was amplified. The boundaries were designed based on the MIF4G domain of the human ortholog CWC22, which has been shown to bind eIF4AIII (65). To serve as a control, either MBP or EGFP alone was used. : bioRxiv preprint Interactome of RNA Binding Proteins from Drosophila ovaries 6 Drosophila stocks All flies were kept at room temperature on standard Drosophila medium. Oregon R flies were used as wildtype. Fosmid lines expressing GFP-tagged proteins were purchased from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (VDRC 318283, 318719, 318195, 318157, 318898, 318766), as previously published (66). To generate the control fly line expressing the tag only, the tag sequence was cloned in a modified pUAST-attB vector (67) (without UAS sites or SV40 poly(A) signal), downstream of a moderately expressing exu promoter using KpnI and BamHI sites. The purified vector was injected into embryos from a recombinant stock with a genotype y[1] M{vas-int.Dm} ZH-2A w[*]; PBac{y[+]-attP-3B}VK00033 (BDSC 24871). Transgenic flies were identified in the F1 generation by the presence of red eyes (dsRed) and a stable fly line was established. Cell culture and co-IP from HEK cells Human HEK293 cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum, Glutamine and Penicillin-Streptomycin solution, at 37 \u00baC in the presence of 5% CO2. For co-immunoprecipitations (co-IP), transfections were carried out in six-well plates with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, 5 \u03bcg of DNA was transfected in each well and the ratio of two plasmids was adjusted based on their expression levels. If required, a third empty plasmid with HA tag was supplemented, to reach a total amount of 5 \u03bcg. Cells were collected 2 days after transfection and washed with PBS prior to lysis. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 at 4 \u00baC, 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM Sucrose, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (cOmplete\u2122, EDTA-free Protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). For efficient lysis, cells were mechanically sheared by passing them through a needle (Sterican 21G 7/8\" \u00d8 0.8X22mm) several times. Cell lysates were cleared at 16,000g for 15 min at 4 \u00baC and supernatants were supplemented with 5 \u00b5l/ ml of RNase A/T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 4 \u00baC. After clearing the lysate again at 16,000g for 15 min, 12-20 \u00b5l of GFP-TRAP MA beads (Chromotek) were added to the supernatant and the mixtures were rotated for 1 hour at 4 \u00baC. For Flag pull-downs, 1.8 \u00b5g of monoclonal anti-Flag (Sigma #F1804) was added to the supernatant, post RNase treatment. After 1 hour at 4 \u00baC in rotation, 20 \u00b5l of GammaBind Plus",

            "text": "The post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression requires several trans-acting factors that regulate the life cycle of an mRNA (1) . Many of these factors are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with the maturing mRNAs to form functional messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs), interconnecting various steps of RNA metabolism, thereby controlling gene expression (1) (2) (3) . In Drosophila oogenesis, mRNPs are first assembled in the nurse cell nucleus, providing a platform for the formation of larger dynamic assemblies in the cytoplasm, regulating mRNA transport, silencing and localized translation. Several RBPs have been identified and extensively studied in Drosophila development. Some of the well characterized and evolutionary conserved examples include the dsRNA-binding protein Staufen (Stau) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) , the DEAD-box helicases Vasa (Vas) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) and eIF4AIII (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) , the CCHC-type zinc finger protein Nanos (Nos) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) Hrp48 and Glorund (Glo) (31-33). Binding of these proteins is essential for the proper expression of four key maternal transcripts: bicoid (bcd), oskar (osk), gurken (grk) and nanos (nos), critical to define the future embryonic axes. In addition to their functions in establishing oocyte polarity, these RBPs have various other roles during Drosophila oogenesis. For example, Hrp48 and Glo are required in nurse cells for the regulation of chromosome organization (38, 47). They have also been implicated as regulators of alternative splicing,",

Additionally, we activated the \"matching between runs\" algorithm to quantify unidentified or un-sequenced peptides in the samples, by transferring peptide identifications among replicates. The global analysis of the proteomes resulted in the identification of 15,005 peptides mapping to 1878 protein groups, at a FDR of 1% at the peptide and protein level. Of these, 1841 unique protein groups were quantified in at least one of the 21 samples, which account for 87.5% of the total ovary proteome of Drosophila (84) . The average correlation within replicates ranged from 0.71 (Glo) to 0.92 (Hrp48), suggesting overall good reproducibility of the data (Fig. 1c ). In addition, the visualization of LFQ intensities of all the samples as a heat map demonstrates that all the baits were consistently enriched (Fig.   S2c ). The replicate profiles looked largely similar, with only minor differences. However, the number of proteins quantified with each bait varied highly, as marked by the absence of information in the heat map ( Fig. S2c ).",

This approach is advantageous for Drosophila, where metabolic isotopic labeling is still challenging. To confirm the results of our label-free analysis, we carried out dimethyl labeling MS for the Hrp48-and Vas-GFP samples. We chose Hrp48 and Vas as these proteins express well and they are involved in the translational regulation of the same set of transcripts (35, 36, 40, 45-47). We carried out the experiments in duplicates and purified the samples the same way as for label-free MS (Fig. S2b ). After in-gel digestion, we labeled the peptides with heavy, medium or light isotopes and inverted the labels in the replicate, to minimize the variability due to the labeling procedures. As before, the raw data were processed with the MaxQuant software (71), providing confident identification of proteins (1% FDR) and normalized protein-abundance ratios. The analysis of the Vas-and Hrp48-associated proteomes resulted in the identification of 4027 peptides, mapping to 615 protein groups. The replicates showed high correlation and the abundance ratios calculated could be well duplicated. We considered as a hit those proteins that we identified with an abundance ratio of >2 in both replicates. Consistent with the label-free analysis, we found several known interactors, most of them reproducibly enriched (Fig. 2b ). To check how the two analyses relate to each other, we mapped the proteins identified in labeled MS onto the label-free MS data. As shown in Fig. 3 , the proteins that were significantly enriched in the labeled MS followed the same distribution profile and showed up to 47% overlap (for Vas) with those enriched in the label-free MS analysis. Background proteins identified in labeled MS (<2 fold in both replicates) showed a similar profile when graded on the corresponding label-free MS data (Fig. 3 ). To get a comprehensive view of the proteomes associated with Hrp48 and Vas, we combined the enriched proteins from both analyses.",

To gain a systemic understanding of the network, we also added the known protein-protein associations from the String v. 11.0 (77) and FlyBase (78) databases. Next, we carried out a modularity analysis to identify highly connected communities of proteins (Fig. 4a ). As expected, many proteins involved in oogenesis, mRNA localization, translational regulation and germ cell formation were selectively enriched with all the baits. Additionally, proteins involved in neurogenesis and splicing were also overrepresented, consistent with the well-studied function of selected RBPs in these processes (Fig. 4b) .",

In line with the localization of Hrp48 to P-bodies (111), we co-purified several components of the mRNA decay machinery, including the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex with Hrp48-GFP. It is possible that these interactions are indirect and mediated by BicaudalC (BicC) and Belle (Bel). These proteins negatively regulate target mRNAs together with the CCR4-NOT complex (112, 113) . We demonstrated in vitro binding of Hrp48 with both BicC and Bel. This suggests that by recruiting these proteins, Hrp48 may regulate the nos and osk mRNAs, possibly via CCR4-NOT mediated deadenylation ( Fig. 8; ref. (112-115) ).

While CG10077 is an ortholog of human DDX5, Mahe is an evolutionary conserved regulator of Notch signaling (127) . We could recapitulate the interaction of Mahe with both Hrp48 and Glo, and CG10077 with Glo in our co-IP assay. mRNAs. Integrating isolated complexes into interaction networks will further enable functional insights into poorly characterized proteins. Given the evolutionary conservation of several RBPs, our study provides a framework to transfer information to other systems, enhancing our understanding of regulation of RBPs and their diverse roles in developmental processes.

Accumulation of grk at the antero-dorsal corner determines the dorso-ventral axis of the embryo. The posterior targeting of osk requires several RBPs including Stau, eIF4AIII, Hrp48, Glo and Vas (4, 25, 34-38). Once localized, translation of osk initiates the assembly of the pole plasm by anchoring Vas to the posterior of the oocyte, a critical step in the formation of germ cells (39-41). This also results in posterior localization and activation of nos, essential for the embryonic abdominal patterning (42). Remarkably, many components of the osk mRNP regulate multiple transcripts. For example, Stau is also essential for the anterior accumulation of bcd mRNA in the eggs (43, 44). Hrp48, Glo and Vas regulate the localization and translational regulation of both osk and grk transcripts (35-38, 40, 45-47). Glo also represses non-localized nos in the oocytes (48), while Vas promotes nos translation in the embryos (49).",

Our results highlight the diverse functions of these complexes in the post-transcriptional regulation of maternal mRNAs. The purification with the Stau-GFP bait of Loquacious (Loqs), a component of the RNAi machinery is one such example. Loqs is a conserved cytoplasmic double-stranded-RNA-binding protein (dsRBP). The protein participates in the biogenesis and processing of small non-coding RNAs that operate within the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (98). RNAi plays an important role in Drosophila germline development and the early phase of osk repression (99). Drosophila Loqs mutant females are sterile and their ovaries fail to sustain germ-line stem cells (100). We found that both Dicer and Loqs are highly enriched in the Stau IP. We could confirm the Stau-Loqs interaction in vitro. This suggests a potential role for Stau in translational repression of osk by associating with the RNAi machinery. Although no such evidence has been presented in Drosophila, recent reports in other insects (D. citri and L. decemlineata) (101, 102) and the nematode C. elegans (11) have shown a requirement for Stau in RNAi responses. These results suggest a conserved role for Stau in RNAimediated gene silencing.",

The functional characterization of the protein interactions uncovered in this study will require further in vivo studies.With certain limitations such as partial functionality of bait proteins or loss of transient or weak interactions, our ability to recover many known associations and validation of several newly identified interactions indicates the general reliability of our data. Although we performed the experiments in a transcript-independent manner, cluster-based analysis of the complexes can be used to identify functional units potentially regulating different",

Experiments were carried out in biological duplicates(Table S2)and labels were swapped to correct for errors in the labeling procedures. Bioinformatics analysis of the label-free MS data was done using Perseus v. 1.6.5.0 (75) (Supplementary proteins table for label-freeMS; Supplementary statistics table for label-freeMS). Protein identifications were filtered for potential contaminants, proteins identified only by modified peptides and peptides derived from the reversed sequence of the decoy database. Protein intensity values were logarithmized (Log2) and replicates for each bait were grouped together. For identification of protein interactions, data was analyzed in a pairwise fashion i.e. each individual bait group against the control group. Proteins were filtered based on the identification of min 3 valid values in at least one replicate group. As the data followed a normal distribution, the missing values were imputed (using 0.3 standard deviations width reduction and 1.8 standard deviations downshift) enabling statistical analysis. Both-sided Welch's t-test was used with s0 value of 2, to control the artificial within-group variance. For each test, to filter the rows, a requirement of at least 2 valid values in the bait group was set, further controlling the effects of imputation. A 5-10% FDR cut-off (permutation-based; number of randomizations: 250 without preserving groupings) was set to determine significantly enriched proteins.
