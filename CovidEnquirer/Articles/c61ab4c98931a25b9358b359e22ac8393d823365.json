C. neoformans is shed in pigeon feces and can be found in soil or in avian excreta. C. neoformans var. gatti is found in the developing flower of some Australian Eucalypt trees (red river gums and forest red gums). High concentrations of organisms are found in the bark and the accumulated debris surrounding the base of the tree. These trees have been widely exported around the world from Australia. \u2022 Histoplasmosis is caused by a dimorphic fungus which forms a free-living mycelial form and yeastlike organisms in mammalian tissues. Found in central USA especially in Ohio, Mississippi and Missouri River basins and in Central and South America. There is association with moist humid conditions, nitrogen-rich soils, and bat and bird excrement. \u2022 Coccidioidomycosis is caused by a soil mycelial organism with a natural resevoir in desert soils and around animal burrows.
