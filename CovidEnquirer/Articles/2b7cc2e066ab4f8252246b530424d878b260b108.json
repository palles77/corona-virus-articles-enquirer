            "text": "Paramyxovirus infections can be detected worldwide with some emerging zoonotic viruses and currently there are no specific therapeutic treatments or vaccines available for many of these diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from the two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) of paramyxovirus fusion proteins could be used as inhibitors of virus fusion. The mechanism underlying this activity is in accordance with that of class I virus fusion proteins, of which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus fusion proteins are members. For class I virus fusion proteins, the HR1 fragment binds to HR2 to form a six-helix bundle with three HR1 fragments forming the central coiled bundle surrounded by three coiled HR2 fragments in the post fusion conformational state (fusion core). It is hypothesized that the introduced exogenous HR1 or HR2 can compete against their endogenous counterparts, which results in fusion inhibition. Using Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model, we designed several protein inhibitors, denoted HR212 as well asHR121 and 5-Helix, which could bind the HR1 or HR2 region of fusion protein, respectively. All the proteins were expressed and purified using a GST-fusion expression system in Escherichia coli. The HR212 or GST-HR212 protein, which binds the HR1 peptide in vitro, displayed inhibitory activity against NDV-mediated cell fusion, while the HR121 and 5-Helix proteins, which bind the HR2 peptide in vitro, inhibited virus fusion from the avirulent NDV strain when added before the cleavage of the fusion protein. These results showed that the designed HR212, HR121 or 5-Helix protein could serve as specific antiviral agents. These data provide additional insight into the difference between the virulent and avirulent strains of NDV. q 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

            "text": "Like many enveloped viruses, paramyxovirus requires virus-cell fusion and mediates cell-cell fusion. 1 At least two viral membrane glycoproteins of the paramyxovirus fusion protein (F) and attachment protein (HN, H or G, depending on the genus) participate in the fusion process. For many paramyxoviruses, such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the attachment proteins (HN for NDV) are absolutely required for F proteinmediated cell fusion, 1 while other paramyxoviruses, such as simian parainfluenza virus 5 (SV5) 2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 3 fusion does not absolutely require attachment proteins. The mechanism underlying this difference is unclear. The F proteins of paramyxovirus contain conserved functional domains, which include the fusion peptide and two heptad repeat (HR) regions, called HR1 or HR-A and HR2 or HR-B. 4 The fusion peptide, responsible for insertion of the F protein into the host cell membrane, is located immediately before the HR1 region in paramyxovirus. Biochemical and crystal structure studies demonstrated that the HR1 and HR2 could form a stable six-helix bundle, which is referred to as a trimer of HR1 and HR2 heterodimer or trimer of hairpins. This has been suggested to represent the core structure of the post-fusion F protein, known also as the fusion core. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] It has been shown that peptides derived from the HR regions could inhibit virus-mediated cell fusion, probably by disturbing the interaction of the HR regions during the conformational changes of the F protein. 6 Like all the members in the Paramyxoviridae family, the NDV F protein is synthesized initially as a precursor, F 0 , and then cleaved into the disulfidelinked subunits F 1 and F 2 by a furin-like enzyme of the host cells. 12 This cleavage of the F protein is necessary for protein maturation and fusion activation. 13 The cleavability of the F 0 protein is a key determinant for infectivity and pathogenicity of NDV. 12 For avirulent NDV strains, the F protein cannot be cleaved by the furin-like enzyme in the cell culture and can exist as F 0 only at the cell surface. Therefore, the fusion process cannot be fulfilled unless an exogenous protease such as trypsin is added to promote F 0 cleavage into the fusion activation form. Previous studies [14] [15] [16] [17] from our laboratory and others have shown that, similar to the HR2 peptides of the HIV-1 gp41 protein, the peptides derived from the NDV F protein HR2 regions could be used as inhibitors of F or virusmediated cell fusion, but the inhibition activity of HR1 peptides was poorly characterized, likely due to their hydrophobicity, just as the HR1 peptides of the HIV-1 gp41 protein [18] [19] [20] . Interestingly, previous studies showed that peptides derived from the HR1 domain of the NDV F could inhibit F proteinmediated fusion only if added prior to the cleavage of the F 0 protein in an in vitro transfection system. 16 However, the mechanism involved was unclear.",

Therefore, it requires further experimentation with more stable preparations to distinguish between these possibilities in order to better characterize the NDV fusion mechanism. In this study, we built upon our previous constructs 9 and designed three new proteins called HR121, HR212 and 5-Helix.

Most of the GST fusion 5-Helix and HR121 proteins were soluble in the supernatants of the lysed E. coli cells when expressed at 30 8C, while GST-HR212 proteins were soluble when expressed at both 30 8C and 37 8C. For elution of GST-5-Helix and GST-HR121 proteins, 150 mM NaCl was added to the elution buffer and an increased elution volume was used in order to improve the results. This is likely due to the hydrophobicity of the HR1 region. The 5-Helix, HR121 and HR212 were purified after removing the cleaved GST and GST-3C ( Figure 2 ). The GST pulldown assay showed that GST-5-Helix and GST-HR121 could bind especially well with HR2 or HR212, while GST-6-Helix did not show any convincing binding ( Figure 3 ). GST-HR212 could bind with HR1 peptides (Figure 3(c) ). It was further demonstrated by gel-filtration analysis that GST untagged 5-Helix, HR121 and HR212 could interact with HR2 or HR1 peptides, respectively. After 5-Helix, HR121 and HR212 were mixed with HR2 or HR1 peptides, their elution peaks shifted as compared to those of the controls. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated an association between the proteins and the peptides (Figure 4 ), which indicated a specific interaction of the peptide partners. These results suggested that the designed proteins could be potential fusion inhibitors of NDV F protein-mediated cell fusion.",

This indicated that both HR121 and HR212 could form multimers, probably trimers. Subsequently, chemical cross-linking of HR121 and HR212 preparations showed that both dimers and trimers could be seen on a reducing gel ( Figure 5 (a) and (b)). Monomers/dimers tended to fade as the EGS cross-linker concentrations were increased, whereas the trimer bands became more prominent. These data implicated protein trimers, although the monomer/dimer bands were still visible, even in high concentrations of the crosslinker. It was also demonstrated by gel-filtration peak shifting that one trimer of HR121 or HR212 probably could bind three HR2 or HR1 molecules ( Figure 4 (b) and (c)).",

These results, as well as the GST pull-down assay (Figure 3) , indicated that HR212 proteins performed their fusion inhibition activity through binding to the HR1 domain of F protein, but it was still unclear at which stage this occurred. To address this, a high concentration of HR212 proteins was added at different times after adsorption of the NDV virulent strain to HeLa cells.

Great efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular mechanism of enveloped virus entry and fusion, with an increasing number of studies showing that most enveloped viruses have a similar fusion process. Therefore, similar studies on fusion inhibition have been conducted in recent years. 4, 6, 21 Peptides derived from the heptad repeat regions of virus fusion proteins have been demonstrated to be fusion inhibitors for many enveloped viruses (class I), such as retrovirus and paramyxovirus. For HIV, a peptide called T-20 or Enfuvirtide q , derived from the HR2 (or C-peptide) domain of gp41 has currently finished the third clinical trial in USA as an anti-HIV drug. 22 However, the high cost of peptide synthesis and instability limit the broad use of this drug. Studies showed that peptides corresponding to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1 or N-peptide) of gp41 were weak inhibitors of HIV fusion, likely due to their tendency to aggregate. 19, 20 Much effort has been devoted to the design of more stable and effective protein inhibitors of HIV fusion, including N-peptides fused with trimeric coiled-coils, 18 a chimeric protein termed N CCG -gp41, 23 and a protein called 5-Helix. 24 They were all demonstrated to prevent HIV fusion. In this study, we designed several protein inhibitors, including 5-Helix, on the basis of our previous studies of paramyxovius fusion, 9 and the results showed that all the proteins could inhibit NDVmediated cell fusion. This study showed also that all the proteins, including HR121 and HR212, were very stable and could be obtained easily by expression and purification. This design strategy should be tested for other enveloped viruses, especially HIV.",

            "text": "For paramyxovirus, virus fusion involves at least two envelope glycoproteins, an attachment protein and fusion protein, which are responsible for receptor binding and cell fusion, respectively. F protein is believed to mediate the fusion between the cellular membrane and the virus membrane through a series of conformational changes. 1 In the current model, 6 there are at least three conformational states of the F protein, i.e. a pre-fusion native state, pre-hairpin intermediate state and post-fusion state. In the post-fusion state, the two conserved HR regions bind each other in an antiparallel fashion as a coiled-coil structure and form the so-called 6-Helix trimer. 6 The two HR regions are highly conserved in all sequenced paramyxoviruses. Like HIV, many studies, including ours, showed that HR2 peptides could inhibit virusmediated or F protein-mediated cell fusion in many paramyxoviruses, including NDV. [15] [16] [17] However, details of the inhibition activity of HR1 peptides had not been clear so far. Our previous study showed that HR1 peptides derived from the NDV F protein had no fusion inhibition ability against NDV-mediated cell fusion, 17 while the other studies showed HR1 peptides could inhibit F protein-mediated cell fusion if added before the F 0 protein was cleaved. 16 Like the HR1 of HIV gp41, the HR1 peptides of paramyxovirus fusion proteins are hydrophobic and tend to aggregate, so it is necessary to design more stable protein inhibitors that have the same function as HR1. We previously designed a construct called 2-Helix, which was a construct connecting HR1 and HR2 as a single chain (HR1-HR2) and the results showed that the 2-Helix protein could form a stable sixhelix bundle trimer. [9] [10] [11] In this study, on the basis of the 2-Helix construct, another HR2 or HR1 was added at the N terminus or C terminus of 2-Helix, i.e. HR2-HR1-HR2 (HR212) and HR1-HR2-HR1 (HR121), to form two new constructs. A 5-Helix protein was constructed according to a recent HIV study. 24 It was demonstrated that all the proteins were a-helical and thermostable, similar to 2-Helix. 9 The 5-Helix and HR121 have the same binding character as HR1, and they are more stable than the single HR1 peptide. The HR212 has the same characteristics as HR2. Both fusion and plaque formation inhibition tests showed that only HR212 could inhibit NDV virulent strainmediated cell fusion, while 5-Helix and HR121 could not, which was consistent with the results of our previous study. 17 It indicated also that the fusion inhibition of HR212 was mediated through its binding activity to HR1 peptides. This suggests that HR212 might inhibit virus fusion through interacting with the HR1 domain of the intact F protein. All the designed proteins, including 5-Helix and HR121, could inhibit the fusion of the NDV avirulent strain if added before F 0 was cleaved. This suggested that 5-Helix and HR121 probably interact with the corresponding domain of the F 0 protein, not the cleaved F 1 /F 2 complex. The paramyxovirus F protein is synthesized initially as a precursor, F 0 , which is cleaved into disulfide-linked F 2 and F 1 by the furin-like enzyme of the host cell. For the F 0 protein of the NDV avirulent strain, the furin-like enzyme cannot cleave it into F 1 and F 2 , so it cannot be activated to promote cell fusion. Additional enzymes are required to cleave the F 0 protein to promote the infection with the avirulent stain. Using this system, it was convenient to detect the inhibition activity of the peptides that were added before F 0 cleavage. On the basis of our results, peptides corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 domains of the NDV F protein can inhibit virus-mediated cell fusion, but the inhibition probably occurs through a different mechanism, e.g. at different stages of F protein conformational changes.",

This was in contrast to the results of others, 16 which showed that both HR1 and HR2 could inhibit cell fusion only when added prior to cleavage activation. As a further characterization, we detected the inhibition of HR212 added at different stages of virus attachment. The results showed that HR212 could exhibit high fusion inhibition only when added as early as 2 min after virus attachment. There was almost no inhibition detected if added after 10 min after the attachment. This result implied that the conformational changes of the F protein occurred very quickly after receptor binding to the HN protein, and that this change was irreversible (i.e. HR212 could interact with the F protein only at the very early stage of fusion). This may explain why the inhibition activity was much lower if added after cleavage activation. However, all these results are still consistent with the idea that HR2 peptides could interact both with cleaved and uncleaved F protein, while the HR1 peptides could interact only with the F 0 protein to inhibit virus fusion.",

Previous studies have shown that HR1 peptides derived from the paramyxoviruses whose fusion absolutely requires HN proteins (or its homologue G or H) appear to not have any fusion inhibition, 17, 25, 26 whereas the HR1 peptides derived from the paramyxoviruses whose fusion does not absolutely require the attachment protein show the fusion inhibition effect. 14,27 Therefore, we assumed that the interaction of the HN and F proteins plays an important role in the HR1/HR2 domain exposure during conformational changes of the F protein. It had been accepted that the conformational change of the F protein was promoted by the HN protein binding to the receptor, 4 and several studies showed that the HN protein was associated with the F protein. 25, 28, 29 Co-expression of the HN and F proteins does alter the conformation of cell-surface F protein. 30 In addition, a recent report demonstrated that the HN protein of NDV could interact with the HR2 domain of the F protein, 31 indicating that this type of interaction may affect the fusion inhibition of HR1 peptides. According to this result, we supposed that the HR2 domain of the mature F protein was hidden by the interaction with the HN protein, and this interaction continues with the conformational change of the F protein. This may be the reason why HR1 peptides cannot bind to block fusion. However, the HR2 domain of the immature F 0 protein was not covered by the HN protein and can be exposed to external HR1 peptides. Additional studies are required to clarify the detailed interaction of HN/F along with associated conformational changes.",

Three different constructs were made by PCR: 5-Helix, HR121 and HR212, as shown in Figure 1 . The 5-Helix construct was engineered by linking 3!HR1 and 2!HR2 with two amino acid linkers (SGGRGG and GGSGG, singleletter amino acid abbreviations used here). The HR121 and HR212 constructs were generated by sequential linking of the HR1, HR2 and HR1 or HR2, HR1 and HR2 using two different linkers (linker 1 as SGGRGG or linker 2 as GGSGG) (Figure 1(b) ). All the constructs were cloned into the BamH I and Xho I sites of the GST fusion expression vector pGEX-6p-1 (Pharmacia), in which there is a rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site for the fusion protein (the same as the commercial PreScissione protease cleavage site). The positive plasmids were verified by direct DNA sequencing.",

Bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 150 mM NaCl). Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the lysate was incubated for 30 min at 0 8C and subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4 8C. The clarified supernatants were passed over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (equalibrated with PBS). The GST fusion protein-bound column was washed with ten column volumes of PBS and eluted with three column volumes of 10 mM reduced glutathione (an extra 150 mM NaCl was added for elution of 5-Helix and HR121 fusion proteins).
