            "text": "Dengue virus receptors are relatively poorly characterized, but there has been recent interest in 2 C-type lectin molecules, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3)-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its close homologue liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing integrin (L-SIGN), which can both bind dengue and promote infection. In this report we have studied the interaction of dengue viruses produced in insect cells, tumor cell lines, and primary human dendritic cells (DCs) with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Virus produced in primary DCs is unable to interact with DC-SIGN but remains infectious for L-SIGNexpressing cells. Skin-resident DCs may thus be a site of initial infection by insect-produced virus, but DCs will likely not participate in large-scale virus replication during dengue infection. These results reveal that differential glycosylation of dengue virus envelope protein is highly dependent on cell state and suggest that studies of virus tropism using virus prepared in insect cells or tumor cell lines should be interpreted with caution.",

Dengue is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that can be subdivided into the 4 major serotypes (DEN-1-DEN-4). Most dengue infections either are asymptomatic or lead to a self-limiting febrile illness, dengue fever. In some cases the illness is more severe, leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with severe plasma leakage and bleeding that can be life threatening.",

There has been considerable work to understand the mechanism of severe disease, but the increased frequency during secondary infection and the occurrence of severe symptoms at a time when virus loads are falling sharply imply that it likely results from immunopathology driven by the acquired immune responses, rather than from direct viral cytopathology [1] [2] [3] [4] . Levels of a number of cytokines, such as interferon c and tumor necrosis factor a [5, 6] , have been shown to correlate with disease severity, and a storm of inflammatory cytokine secretion has been proposed to lead to the vascular leak characteristic of DHF.",

L-SIGN expression was confirmed by surface staining and flow cytometry. Equal expression of alternate-length L-SIGN constructs was also confirmed by western blotting. Transfectants were then infected with dengue virus, and infection was monitored by intracellular staining together with an antibody specific to L-SIGN to reveal transfected cells.

Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of dengue virus complexed to soluble DC-SIGN show interaction with the glycan at position 67 [33] . There have been several reports on the N-linked glycosylation of dengue envelope. Some reports suggest the use of both sites, whereas others suggest that only one is used [23, [34] [35] [36] . We show that in C6/36, Vero cells, and DCs either one or both sites are used for the dengue 2 serotype 16681. Although both glycosylation sites can play important roles in infectivity and viral replication, functional studies have confirmed the importance of Asn-67 for infection of DC-SIGN-expressing cells [33] . WNV E protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at position 154 that is absent from some virus strains [37] . Both dengue and WNV contain a single N-linked site in prM, and although prM is cleaved by furin during viral maturation, a substantial fraction of uncleaved prM is found on some dengue viruses, particularly that produced in insect cells, and such partially cleaved viruses can still be infectious. For WNV the N-linked site on prM can also mediate interaction with L-SIGN, and in common with glycan at position 154 this also showed differential specificity for L-SIGN when expressed in mammalian cell lines, perhaps mediated by the presence of N-acetylglucosamine-terminated structures [29] .",

A number of tumor cell lines express high-mannose sugars, and we have previously described the generation of a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a variety of tumor cell types and which binds to high-mannose moieties [38] . The differential affinity of DC-SIGN for ligands expressed by tumor cell lines versus primary cells has been observed before and led some to speculate that DC-SIGN may participate in tumor surveillance [39] . There appears to be a further added level of complexity as the glycosylation profiles may vary in a given cell line depending on the exact position of the N-linked site within the polypeptide chain [29] .",

Dengue antigens have been demonstrated in the sinusoidal tissue of the liver and vascular endothelium of the lung and spleen and may provide an explanation for the unique pathology observed in these organs [44, 45] . The accumulation of antigen in L-SIGNexpressing tissue may also result in an increase in localized transinfection in a similar way that L-SIGN is thought to be responsible for the capture of HCV from the blood and transmission to hepatocytes or in the case of HIV, to CD4 1 T cells [28, 41] .",
