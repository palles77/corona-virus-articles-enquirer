Here, we compared the cellular properties of the 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins by examining their cellular localizations and their abilities to interact with other SARS-CoV proteins. These results may suggest that the conformations of 8a and 8b are different from 8ab although nearly all the amino acids in 8a and 8b are found in 8ab. In addition, the expression of the structural protein, envelope (E), was down-regulated by 8b but not 8a or 8ab. Consequently, E was not detectable in SARS-CoV-infected cells that were expressing high levels of 8b. These findings suggest that 8b may modulate viral replication and/or pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Interestingly, epidemiological studies have revealed that the part of the viral genome that encodes for two of these accessory proteins, 8a and 8b, shows major variations. In one of these studies, Guan and co-workers (2003) analyzed SARS-CoV isolates obtained from animals in a live-market in Guangdong and found that all the animal isolates contain a 29-nucleotides (nt) sequence, which is absent in most of the human isolates (Fig. 1A) . As a result of this, the ORF8a and ORF8b (also termed as ORF10 and ORF11, respectively) in the human isolates become one ORF, termed as ORF8ab. ORF8ab encodes a protein of 122 amino acids (aa), whose N terminus is identical to 8a and C terminus is identical to 8b (Fig. 1B) . Another extensive study of 63 SARS-CoV isolates obtained from the SARS epidemic in China also showed that there are major variations in this region of the viral genome (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004) . In this study, the course of the epidemic was divided into the early, middle and late phase with the early phase Virology 354 (2006) 132 -142 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro defined as the period of first emergence of SARS in Guangdong Province. The middle phase referred to all events up to the first cluster of SARS cases in the Metropole hotel in Hong Kong and the late phase referred to all cases following this cluster. Interestingly, the clustering of patients with different patterns of variations in ORF8 region was correlated with the different phases of the epidemic. These findings were subsequently verified by researchers who studied the SARS-CoV isolated in different countries (Chiu et al., 2005; Lan et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004 Wang et al., , 2005 . Although these mutations in the ORF8 region do not appear to have any adverse effect on the survival of the virus, it is conceivable that the 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins may have different stabilities and/or functions and hence would contribute differently to viral replication and/or pathogenesis in vivo. In order to understand how the changes in the ORF8 region of the viral Guan et al., 2003) . The animal isolates have an extra 29nucleotides insertion such that the subgenomic RNA encodes for a single protein, termed 8ab, whereas that of the human isolates (from the middle phase) encodes two proteins, 8a and 8b. Human isolates from early and late phases of the epidemic also have the 29-nucleotides insertion found in the animal SARS-CoV. (B) Alignment of the sequences of 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins used in this study. Mismatches between 8a and 8ab or 8b and 8ab are boxed. The 8ab is reconstructed from a human isolate from the middle phase (SIN2774) by insertion of the 29-nucletoides found in a human isolate from the early phase (GZ02). (C) Western blot analysis was performed to detect 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins expressed in Vero E6 cells using cDNA constructs. The experiments were performed with either mouse anti-8a polyclonal antibody (upper panel, lanes 1-4) or mouse anti-8b polyclonal antibody (upper panel, lanes 5-8). Equal amounts of cells were used in each lane as verified by the level of endogenous actin (bottom panel). genome may impact on viral replication or pathogenesis, we compared the cellular properties of the human SARS-CoV 8a and 8b proteins with their counterpart, 8ab, in animal SARS-CoV. Specific antibodies were produced and used to determine the expression of 8a and 8b in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Indirect immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to compare the cellular localization of the 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins and their abilities to interact with other SARS-CoV proteins. Finally, the specific effects of the 8b protein on the expression of the small structural protein E in cells co-expressing 8b and E, and in SARS-CoV-infected cells were demonstrated.",

All these proteins were not tagged except for M, where the C terminus was fused with a HA tag because of the lack of a suitable antibody for the detection of M. 8a, 8b and 8ab were fused at their C termini with a myc tag so that it is possible to compare the relative expression of the three proteins in this experiment. N-terminal-tagged myc-GST was used as a negative control. The results showed that 8amyc interacted strongly with S, 8b-myc interacted strongly with M, E, 3a and 7a and 8ab-myc interacted strongly with S, 3a and 7a (Table 1 and Fig. 3) . These results showed that the binding profiles of 8a, 8b and 8ab are clearly distinct, suggesting that the conformations of the 8a and 8b proteins may be quite different from the 8ab protein.",

Thus, genetic and epidemiological studies can yield valuable insights on how viruses cross the species barrier and evolve to cause disease in humans (Webby et al., 2004) . Indeed, such studies conducted on the SARS-CoV have revealed that this virus has crossed the animal-human barrier recently (Donnelly et al., 2004; Guan et al., 2003; Lau et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005) . Interestingly, the animal strains of SARS-CoV, isolated from a raccoon dog and palm civets in markets/restaurants and from wild bats, contain an extra 29-nt in the ORF8 region Lau et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005) . This 29-nt sequence is not found in all the human strains that were isolated in the middle phase of the epidemic but is present in most of the human isolates from the earliest outbreaks in Guangdong, China, 2002 (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Indeed, human Fig. 5 . Effects of 8b protein on the transcription of the E gene determined by Northern blot analysis.

Although it is clear that the S gene was undergoing positive selection (Holmes, 2005) , whether the genetic variation in the ORF8 region is a result of viral adaptation or genomic instability remains to be deter-mined.

These results suggested that the 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins are not essential for viral replication or pathogenesis in the mouse and palm civet models. However, we found that the expression of 8b can down-regulate the expression of E in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A ) and the expressions of 8b and E in SARS-CoV-infected cells were mutually exclusive (Fig. 7) . Interestingly, the expression of E was not affected by either 8a or 8ab (Fig. 4A ).

DeDiego and Luis Enjuanes, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Madrid, Spain). However, the role of the E protein in SARS-CoV replication in its natural host remains unclear. Interestingly, the E protein is essential for the replication of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Ortego et al., 2002) but not for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Kuo and Masters, 2003) . However, for the latter, the deletion of the E gene reduces virus replication significantly. In addition, it was reported that overexpression of SARS-CoV E can induce apoptosis in T cells ; thus, the downregulation of E may also have an effect on viral pathogenesis.",

Because its translation initiation codon is not the first AUG in the subgenomic RNA, the 8b protein is likely to be expressed via an internal ribosomal entry mechanism or by a leaky ribosomal scanning mode of translation, as have been described for viral proteins encoded by other bicistronic or tricistronic coronaviral mRNAs (Liu and Inglis, 1992; Senanayake and Brian, 1997; Thiel and Siddell, 1994) . However, in order for 8b to be expressed via such mechanisms, activation of certain host translational machineries may be necessary (Komar and Hatzoglou, 2005; Stoneley and Willis, 2004) . Indeed, we observed that 8b was only expressed in a fraction of the SARS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 7) . This means that the effect of 8b on viral replication or pathogenesis is likely to be only modulative as viral replication in those cells that did not express high levels of 8b will be normal. However, this modulating mechanism is not functional in the animal SARS-CoV because 8ab does not appear to have any effect on the expression of E. In future studies, it will be crucial to determine the underlying mechanism regulating the expression of 8b and its temporal expression during the viral replication cycle.",
