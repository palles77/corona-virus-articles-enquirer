There is continual change in the way we approach diseases, in our diagnostic capabilities, in our procedures and skills to provide therapeutic options, and of course, in the human diseases we confront. The emergence of new infectious and noninfectious diseases poses a permanent challenge to medical knowledge and health systems. Multiple case examples support this concept. During the past decade, several new infectious diseases have emerged: for example, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and its related coronavirus, 1 the A H1/N1 human flu strand that was responsible for a 2009 pandemic, 2 and the bird flu strain H7N9 that recently infected humans in China and caused more than 30 deaths. 3 For some newly recognized diseases, there still is no effective prevention or treatment. In the field of noncommunicable diseases, new entities can emerge, some of them related to environmental conditions and others due to unknown causes, yet epidemiology and causality often are less well defined than is the case with infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Nephrology has not been the exception regarding the advent or identification of new clinical entities. During the second half of the last century, Balkan endemic nephropathy (also referred to as aristolochic acid nephropathy) emerged, a chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis that displayed a familial yet not inherited pattern of presentation and was identified among persons living in rural areas of the Danube River in Serbia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Bosnia. [4] [5] [6] Only after 50 years of epidemiologic and clinical studies was aristolochic acid, from the plant Aristolochia clematitis, which contaminated the wheat flour in the region, identified as a likely cause. 5, 6 This same herbal toxin is the cause of Chinese herb nephropathy (also referred to as aristolochic acid nephropathy), first described in a cluster of cases in Belgium 7 and later described in multiple regions of the world, in particular in Asia, in association with ingestion of aristolochic acid-contaminated food products, beverages, and herbal remedies. [8] [9] [10] [11] Whenever there is the suspicion of the emergence of a new clinical entity, a systematic process of identification should be put in place, including epidemiologic, clinical, and pathophysiologic characterization of the disease. Such a scientific and systematic approach is critical to define causality, as demonstrated with the identification of aristolochic acid as the likely cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy. 5 Although CKD is a health problem that is increasing worldwide, in most instances, its cause is linked to known chronic noncommunicable diseases: in particular, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. The Mesoamerican region (geographically comprising Central America and Southeastern Mexico; Fig 1) is not an exception to this increase in CKD because as in other areas of the world, it is experiencing the demographic and epidemiologic transition observed in many developing nations. CKD linked to these chronic noncommunicable diseases is present in Mesoamerica as much as in most other parts of the world. 13 Nevertheless, during at least the last 2 decades, several Central American nations have observed the emergence of and, in some cases, an epidemic increase in a different form of CKD. This form of CKD has been scarcely characterized, and only recently have a few scientific and epidemiologic reports appeared. The first formal mention of the possible presence of a new pathologic entity was published in 2002 by Trabanino et al, 14 who reported that 67% of the population with advanced CKD in Rosales Hospital of El Salvador had a disease of unknown origin. Subsequently, Torres et al, 15 Peraza et al, 16 and several other investigators [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] have laid ground for the definition of a form of CKD for which the cause or causes remain unknown. 24 This nephropathy has emerged in coastal regions of Nicaragua and El Salvador and to some extent Costa Rica 20 and Guatemala. 25 In all affected regions, it has a fairly consistent pattern (Table 1) .",

Instead, they confirmed Correa-Rotter, Wesseling, and Johnson that based on the epidemiologic studies listed in Table 1 , this type of CKD exhibits the following characteristics. First, the location is primarily in a specific geographic region, that is, the coastal Pacific region of Central America. Second, the kidney disease is unrelated to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or other known causes of kidney disease. Third, there is a male predominance (3 or 4:1) and predominance in young individuals (aged 30-50 years). Fourth, there is excessive occurrence in individuals working under hot conditions in agricultural communities, that is, especially workers in sugarcane and former cotton fields in coastal communities.",

Agents that have been proposed as risk factors include, among others, heavy metals, agrochemicals, excessive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as pain killers, or consumption of potentially contaminated alcohol. Moreover, given the extremely hot and humid weather of the affected areas and the extremely strenuous working conditions of the agricultural workers, other potential mechanisms of kidney injury have been proposed. 24, [26] [27] [28] [29] In parallel with the epidemiologic characterization of this disease, its natural history and clinical behavior also have been described. 26, 27, 30, 31 The disease usually manifests as a silent yet progressive and relentless increase in serum creatinine level and absence of or, if any, low-grade (protein excretion , 1 g/d) proteinuria as measured by dipstick, in the otherwise asymptomatic individual. Nephrotic proteinuria is not common, and the urinary sediment, although not systematically reported, often is devoid of blood or casts. Mild hyperuricemia is common, as is hypokalemia. At present, we are not aware of any other systematic laboratory abnormalities that have been identified and or any specific pattern found by renal ultrasound or other imaging techniques. Mesoamerican nephropathy tends to progress to end-stage renal disease at some point, though the time period is not yet defined. In some patients, it occurs a few years after the first evidence of an elevated serum creatinine level. Unfortunately, renal replacement therapy is extremely scarce in Central America, and as such, many individuals who progress to end-stage renal disease are not offered dialysis. Thus, Mesoamerican nephropathy is the most common cause of death of young men working in sugarcane plantations in the lowlands of the Nicaraguan Pacific coast. 22,26 Mesoamerican nephropathy also results in a high mortality rate in El Salvador, 32 including in the sugarcaneproducing Pacific coast, where access to renal replacement therapy also is limited. 33 To date, only a few kidney biopsies of affected patients have been performed. The dominant histopathologic pattern is that of a tubulointerstitial disease, consistent with the clinical presentation. 26,27,30,31 However, Wijkstr\u00f6m et al 34 also noted the common finding of glomerular ischemia, often with a component of global glomerulosclerosis, in a small series describing 8 sugarcane workers.",

Multiple questions arise: are we facing a single cause or is this a mutlifactorial disease? Are we facing known or unknown factors that can cause kidney injury? To effectively advance our knowledge requires significant experimental and clinical research in several fields. The focus of the research will depend on which potential mechanisms are identified as relevant or potentially causative and which specific hypotheses are to be tested. In addition, the research may include a variety of approaches based on physiology, toxicology, epidemiology, and clinical intervention. In Table 2 , we summarize the pros and cons of selected etiologic agents that may be linked to the development of this clinical entity, as reviewed in the San Jos\u00e9 workshop. 28 The conclusions presented in Table 2 on the whole coincide with the views of the workshop attendees, but in some cases, additional reflections and new information that has emerged after the workshop have been added and priority levels for research have been adjusted. The conclusions reflect current knowledge and likely will change in the future as results of new research become available. Also of note, there was consensus in the workshop that the cause of Mesoamerican nephropathy probably is multifactorial (Fig 2) , with one or more of the factors discussed next interacting with each other.",

The difference in the number of men and women affected argues against environmental pathways of exposures, and if agrochemicals were etiologically involved, occupational exposure would be the most likely setting. Although pesticide exposure has been a major concern for workers, to date no specific agrochemical has been identified as a likely candidate for the epidemic. 46 It is noteworthy that pesticides are a large heterogeneous group of hundreds of active ingredients with different chemical structures and toxicities and a diversity of uses. Pesticide use varies considerably between regions and countries and even within the same crops. It is hard to imagine that the thousands of individuals with CKD in multiple countries would have been occupationally exposed to a specific nephrotoxic pesticide, but this still cannot be ruled out. In addition, environmental exposures, for example, to the nephrotoxic organochlorine insecticide toxaphene, which was widely used in the past on rice and cotton throughout Central America, could be etiologically relevant if its toxicity interacts with another occupational exposure that predominantly affects men, such as exposure to heat and dehydration.",

A study published in 2010 described an association of ingesting this type of unregulated alcohol with CKD. 20 The authors suggested that some \"potential contamination\" of this product could be involved, yet no specific component or causal agent was proposed. In the past, non-legally produced alcoholic products have been reported to cause gout or kidney disease due to contamination by lead, but there is little evidence that this occurs with lija. The observation that lija is not commonly drunk in El Salvador despite the presence of Mesoamerican nephropathy there 16 also makes this possibility unlikely.

A study performed in Costa Rica by Crowe et al 60 also found evidence for significant dehydration during work hours, as noted by urinary specific gravity .1.020 at the end of their shift, and significantly more heat stress and dehydration-related symptoms among cane cutters compared with noncutters in the same sugarcane company over the harvest period.

This leads to some conversion of glucose in the proximal tubule to sorbitol and fructose, which then is metabolized by fructokinase to generate oxidants that cause local tubular injury. Volume depletion also may cause renal injury by other mechanisms, including decreased renal perfusion (causing tubular injury). 37 In addition, repeated dehydration and exhausting physical work may be accompanied by other mechanisms of tissue injury, such as rhabdomyolysis. All these conditions often are accompanied by the intake of NSAIDs as stimulants and pain relievers, further jeopardizing appropriate renal medullary blood flow in particular and whole kidney perfusion in general. These various contributory factors may favor discrete yet repeated episodes of acute kidney injury, which in turn could be responsible for the CKD seen in the long term in this population. Further studies are needed to test this and other hypotheses. If long-term recurrent dehydration or volume depletion is a cause of CKD, it also may play a role in CKD in other countries such as Sri Lanka, where epidemics of kidney disease are being reported. 61 If this hypothesis is true, Mesoamerican nephropathy may represent a disease of or exacerbated by global warming.",

Providing appropriate sources of hydration and sanitation and allowing for reasonable working shifts accompanied by periods of rest and provision of shade are all recommended strategies for prevention. Such interventions should be adequately studied for effectiveness by means of field trials. In addition, even if pesticides eventually are found not to cause CKD, there is no doubt that any potential hazards associated with their use should be minimized, and sustainable nontoxic pest control methods should be favored. Other factors that have been discussed, including limiting alcohol consumption, are an equal matter of concern that in any case should be modified and reduced to improve the general health of this population.",

This type of CKD is not due to diabetes, hypertension, or obesity. Although a variety of causes have been considered, to date there is no conclusive evidence of any specific risk factor being the cause of this epidemic. However, a likely candidate is recurrent dehydration related to occupational exposure to heat, likely exacerbated by NSAIDs or other toxins. The occupational heat exposure leading to Mesoamerican nephropathy to date has been most evident among sugarcane workers, whose social and labor conditions are part of the cause of Mesoamerican nephropathy and should be considered by policy makers and development agencies. Further studies are indicated to identify the physiologic cause, in the context of their social determinants.",
