            "text": "Since September, 2012, WHO has been notifi ed of 64 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. 1 This new disease has many features reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-eg, predominance of respiratory symptoms, airborne transmission, high case-fatality ratio, and caused by a virus of the Betacoronavirus genus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses. [2] [3] [4] [5] The SARS-CoV pandemic had been preceded by outbreaks in southeast China between November, 2002, and January, 2003. 6, 7 During this period, the virus is thought to have been repeatedly introduced into human populations from its intermediate hosts (eg, the masked palm civet) before adapting to interhuman transmission. 8, 9 The molecular events leading to the mutation that enabled the SARS-CoV spike protein to bind with the human ACE2 receptor have been particularly well described. 10 The same sequence of events might be occurring with MERS-CoV, which has been repeatedly introduced into the human population for more than a year (from an unknown animal host) and might have human pandemic potential. One useful indicator of virus transmissibility is the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which represents the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population. When R 0 is above 1, epidemic potential has been reached. We aimed to adapt a recently published method of estimating R 0 11 to the MERS-CoV outbreaks and compare the results with similar fi ndings obtained for prepandemic SARS.",

We took into account 55 of the 64 laboratory-confi rmed cases. We excluded the nine cases notifi ed in the 2 weeks preceding June 21, 2013, because the incubation period of MERS-CoV could be up to 14 days, so these cases might belong to current transmission clusters. 16 For improved modelling consistency, we also took into account seven probable cases: (1) one case, a patient who travelled from Saudi Arabia to Tunisia where two of his children, who had subsequent contact with him, tested positive; (2) the fourth case of the family cluster detected in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in October, 2012 (a patient aged 16 years who was symptomatic but was not tested for MERS-CoV); 14 (3) cases A and C, reported as probable in the investigation of the Al-Hasa cluster; 15 and (4) three cases in the Jordanian cluster. The large number of unconfi rmed cases (11 of 13) in the Jordanian cluster called for caution. On the basis of a 38% case-fatality ratio in individuals younger than 60 years (see summary statistics in the Results section), and considering that the patients with the two confi rmed cases in the Jordanian cluster died, we estimated that the expected cluster size could be 2/0\u00b738, which is roughly 5. Hence, we considered three additionally probable cases next to the two confi rmed ones in the Jordanian cluster. We also did a sensitivity analysis of our results, varying the size of the Jordanian cluster between two and 13 (appendix).",

First, we used published epidemiological investigations of MERS-CoV See Online for appendix clusters (ie, the Jordanian, 12 UK, 4 French, 13 Al-Hasa, 15 and Riyadh 14 clusters) to provide information about their tree structure. Second, we regarded the MERS-CoV clusters detected outside the Middle East as trees generated by the patient travelling outside the Middle East. Third, we made assumptions on the occurrence of transmission events on the basis of epidemiological links between cases to investigate the clusters that remained otherwise unresolved. We regarded cases as epidemiologically linked if the patients were either close family members or had documented contact and, furthermore, if the dates of onset were separated by the minimum incubation period (ie, 2 days 15 ). Hence, we did not consider infectious ness outside the symptomatic period, since no data support it at present, and all transmission data available so far are compatible with transmission during the symptomatic phase. 15 This feature was also true for SARS-CoV. 2 We investigated two diff erent scenarios for partitioning the remaining clusters. Our fi rst scenario assumes a large number of index patients per cluster, each generating a small tree, which results in a high introduction rate of the virus into the human population and a moderate transmissibility. The two cluster par tition ing rules of the fi rst scenario are that a report of an epidemiological link between two infected individuals certifi es that trans mission occurred between these individuals, and that all unlinked individuals are sporadic cases. However, we note that two epidemio logically linked cases might have become infected after common MERS-CoV exposure. Hence, the fi rst rule is a modelling choice that can be refi ned as further data become available. According to scenario 1, we regarded two Saudi Arabian clusters of two and four cases (the cluster of four cases located in Riyadh 14 ) as single trees since they consisted of family members. The cluster of fi ve reported in Dammam was partitioned into three sporadic cases and one tree of two cases, since two of the patients shared a hospital room. We split the Jordanian cluster into three sporadic cases and a tree of two cases (patient 3 and his brother, patient 8). 12 Our second scenario assumes a small number of large trees, which results in a low introduction rate and raised transmissibility of the virus. In this case, we grouped the individuals in one cluster to obtain the maximum tree sizes compatible with the epidemiological investigations. Hence, in the second scenario the Dammam and Jordanian clusters were regarded as transmission trees each containing fi ve cases. The distribution of tree sizes obtained for both scenarios is given in the table.",

If R 0 is less than 1, then all transmission trees terminateotherwise transmission trees might be infi nite and the disease becomes an epidemic. Assuming a Poisson distribution of the number of secondary cases, we inferred the R 0 of MERS-CoV using Bayesian analysis (appendix). We also did two sensitivity analyses of our R 0 results. First, we varied the size of the Jordanian cluster between two (the number of confi rmed cases) and 13 (the total number of confi rmed and probable cases). Second, we investigated the consequences of the outstanding event of six secondary cases caused by patient C of the Al-Hasa cluster in the dialysis ward (appendix).",

The number of transmission trees for each scenario provided the number of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population during the period of data acquisition. Hence, we obtained yearly introduction rates of 22\u00b73 (95% CI 13\u00b70-31\u00b75) and 17\u00b71 (9\u00b70-25\u00b73) for scenario 1 and 2, respectively. We also obtained an R 0 of 0\u00b780 (0\u00b754-1\u00b713) for prepandemic SARS. Repeating the analyses assuming the size of the Jordanian cluster to be between two and 13 or excluding the outstanding event of six secondary cases caused by patient C of the Al-Hasa cluster in the dialysis ward 15 showed the robustness of our results (appendix). As shown in fi gure 2A, the average tree size is very sensitive to the value of R 0 , particularly when R 0 is close to 1. We further studied the expected yearly incidence of MERS-CoV infections, calculated by multiplying the intro duction rate into the human population by the average tree size, 1 / (1 -R 0 ). 11 Figure 2B shows a contour map of the yearly incidence versus the introduction rate and R 0 . Non-linear dependence qualifi es R 0 as the key parameter, particularly for values close to 1. On the same fi gure 2B, we plotted the parameters corresponding to our scenarios 1 and 2 and showed the region in the parameter space most likely to include the true parameters of MERS-CoV. This plot suggests that the possibility of MERS-CoV having an R 0 above 1 or less than 0\u00b74, or a yearly introduction rate above 35, is very small. To assess the potential eff ect of future MERS-CoV outbreaks on our R 0 estimation, we analysed the change in the probability that R 0 exceeds 1 versus the tree size that would be observed next (fi gure 2C). In scenario 2, a tree larger than 98 cases would imply that the probability of having a pandemic MERS-CoV strain exceeds 5%. In scenario 1, reaching the 5% threshold would need the next observed tree to consist of 200 cases.",

Despite phylogenetic similarities, the two viruses have distinct biology, such as the use of diff erent human receptors. 10,17 SARS-CoV adaptation to human beings took just several months, whereas MERS-CoV has already been circulating for more than a year in human populations without mutating into a pandemic form. However, the speed of adaptation depends on several variables, some of which might widely diff er between China and the Middle East (eg, animal and human density, baseline preventive measures, and, most importantly, the prepandemic R 0 ). 18 Because of the very small number of MERS-CoV sequences available, nonsynonymous mutations suggesting viral adaptation could not be yet established. Hence, comparison between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should remain cautious. Figure 2B displays the yearly number of cases as a function of two variables, the yearly introduction rate and R 0 .

When done eff ectively, active contact tracing could reduce the number of cases to the number of MERS-CoV introductions (ie, index patients) and the secondary cases they might cause before isolation. 22 We note that R 0 might also increase with the population density and is aff ected by the community age and contact structure.

Retrospective analysis of sera of contacts of SARS-CoV patients showed a very small (0\u00b72%) proportion of asymptomatic infections. 24 Of note, serum samples of 2400 control patients at the Dr Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where the fi rst patient was diagnosed, did not detect MERS-CoV in an immunofl uorescence assay that was strongly positive with the serum of the patient, suggesting that MERS-CoV was not circulating undetected in the general population during the previous 2 years. 3 The main issue for now is how to interpret the data on the size of future outbreaks that surveillance systems will detect.
