            "text": "Airborne transmission of infectious respiratory diseases in indoor environments has drawn our attention for decades, and this issue is revitalized with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). One of the concerns is that there may be multiple transmission routes across households in high-rise residential buildings, one of which is the natural ventilative airflow through open windows between flats, caused by buoyancy effects. Our early on-site measurement using tracer gases confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively that the re-entry of the exhaust-polluted air from the window of the lower floor into the adjacent upper floor is a fact. This study presents the modeling of this cascade effect using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique. It is found that the presence of the pollutants generated in the lower floor is generally lower in the immediate upper floor by two orders of magnitude, but the risk of infection calculated by the Wells-Riley equation is only around one order of magnitude lower. It is found that, with single-side openwindow conditions, wind blowing perpendicularly to the building may either reinforce or suppress the upward transport, depending on the wind speed. High-speed winds can restrain the convective transfer of heat and mass between flats, functioning like an air curtain. Despite the complexities of the air flow involved, it is clear that this transmission route should be taken into account in infection control. r",

            "text": "Airborne transmission is known to be the route of infection for a number of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Beggs's study in hospital buildings concluded that the contribution of airborne micro-organisms to the spread of infection is likely to be underestimated currently although contact-spread is the principal route of transmission for most infections [1] . Airborne transmission is deemed as long-range aerosol transmission, which refers to the situation that agents can be carried long distances (within a room or between rooms, generally greater than 1 m) by air flows [2] . With the lessons from SARS outbreak in 2003 and the threats from a possible approaching avian influenza pandemic, our concern about aerosol-transmitted infections in hospitals buildings, residential buildings, and even in transportation vehicles has been refreshed. Li et al. [3] reviewed over 40 studies on the relationship between the transmission of infection and ventilation systems in hospitals, offices, aircraft cabins, etc. This interdisciplinary review found that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate the association between ventilation, indoor air movements and the transmission of infection diseases. In a hospital environment, on the basis of the principle of diluting contaminated air using fresh air, a ventilation rate of at least 12 air changes per hour is recommended for new isolation rooms (constructed since 2001) equipped with mechanical ventilation systems [4] . To restrict virus transmission between wards, negative pressure ventilation systems are used. However, Escombe median ventilation of 28 air changes per hour (ACH), more than double that of mechanically ventilated rooms [5] . The airborne infection probability for 24 h exposure to tuberculosis predicted by the Wells-Riley model was reduced from 39% in mechanically ventilated rooms to 33% in naturally ventilated rooms. They suggested that in resource-limited settings where negative-pressure isolation rooms were difficult to implement, natural ventilation may be a low-cost alternative.",

In addition, the SARS virus was found within the deposits on the windowsill and floors on two other upper floors, where residents on floors immediately beneath had been infected with SARS. Prompt investigations upon the occurrences ruled out the possibilities of the spread via unsealed U-traps of the drainage systems in the building. These blocks have rectangular plan layouts and have common corridors separating the two sides, each of which has a flat-facade with operable windows. With doors closed, the flats become single-sided naturally ventilated, and the open windows function as both inlet and outlet of air. Room exhaust air, which is typically not centralized and not stacked, is left to drift freely around the building. Therefore, the exhaust air of one flat may become the intake of the adjacent upper flat. Under normal circumstances, one can detect from the smell of the air what one's neighbor is cooking. This fact arouses our concern about the vertical upward transport of contaminants between flats in high-rise residential buildings with natural ventilation, i.e., there may be a cascade effect, which has been over-looked so far in both building design and infection control.",

However, in densely occupied urban environments, there may be only one external fac -ade for small cellular rooms. The design of buildings thus often adopts single-sided natural ventilation. In this configuration, wind turbulence and temperature differences between indoor and outdoor areas are the main driving forces. Although the uncertainty of these driving forces makes natural ventilation not as controllable as mechanical ventilation, a well-designed natural ventilation system is not only energy efficient compared with mechanical ventilation systems, but also able to provide a comfortable and healthy indoor environment. Temperature-driven single-sided natural ventilation through large openings has been fully studied in regard to air change rate [7] and the resulting indoor air quality and comfort level [8] by experimental works [9] , theoretical predictions [10] , and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations [11] . However, less consideration has been given to the fate of the exhaust air so far, and on whether it will re-enter the upper floor with the same mechanism. Allocca et al. [12] simulated pure buoyancy-driven single-sided natural ventilation through a lower and upper opening in a three-storey building. They found that although the flats were physically and thermally isolated from one another, the indoor temperature level in each flat increased slightly with height, which they attributed to the outside thermal plume from the openings underneath. In their configurations, the distance between upper openings of one space and lower openings of the above space was small. Unfortunately, this cascade effect of energy is not elaborated in detail in their study, nor the transport of contaminants. From the point of view of infection control, this cascade air flow is undesirable. Earlier special onsite investigations after the SARS outbreak revealed that the room immediately upstairs could contain up to 7% of the exhaust air from the lower floor [13] . Our previous simulations also exhibited this cascade effect in windless cases [14] . This study applies the CFD method to investigate the combined effect of wind and buoyancy on the upward contaminant transport. The investigation is focused on the passive tracer gas concentration field and infection risks. Some of the results are compared with the earlier on-site measurements [13] . Considering that the sizes of human-generated aerosols typically range from 5 to 100 mm, using a tracer gas to represent their aerodynamic behaviors by neglecting the gravity effect on the aerosols can reasonably give meaningful results, especially for those fine droplets. The aerosols' movement modeling, which can more accurately capture the dispersion characteristics of sneezed/coughed virus-containing droplets, will be studied and reported in a separate paper.",

The prediction of mean velocity agrees well with the experiment, whereas the temperature profile is higher than the experimental data. Heat loss due to imperfect insulation at the top and bottom walls in the experiment reduces the core temperature at any level [18] . The linear vertical gradient of the dimensionless temperature is represented well by RNG k-e model, and the relaminarization effect at the bottom of the hot wall and the top of the cold wall is clearly captured in this simulation. The value of convective heat transfer coefficient based on the wall-to-cavity-center temperature difference is 3.51 W/m 2 K. It is very close to the simulation by Chen et al.

The mean air velocity and its fluctuation along 10 vertical lines were measured by a laser Doppler anemometer. The mean air velocities at four of these lines, ranging from 25 to 500 mm in height, are selected for comparisons with the current simulation (Fig. 4b ). In the isothermal simulation, the computational domain have a downstream length of 8H, an upstream of 4H, a lateral length of 4W on both sides, and a height of 4H. The domain inlet velocity profile in the x direction follows a logarithmic law (U\u00f0y\u00de \u00bc \u00f0U 0 =k\u00de ln\u00f0y=y 0 \u00de), and the velocity components in y and z directions are zero. The velocity vector at the middle section is illustrated in Fig. 5 , and mean velocity distributions at different height levels are shown in Fig. 6 . It is well known that the flowfield around a surface-mounted cube involves impinge-ment, separation, and vortex shedding, etc. The use of isotropic k-e models and wall functions has revealed deficiencies in this situation, with Reynolds-stress model performing better and large eddy simulation being the best. In Fig. 5 , the recirculation zones before and after the cubic are reproduced by the RNG model. However, the small reverse flow above the cubic is not captured. Murakami et al. [24] attributed this error to the over-prediction of turbulent kinetic energy in the stagnant impingement region, which consequently produced large eddy viscosity and the reverse flow on the cubic roof was negated by this large viscosity. The simulated velocity agrees well with the measurement except at the line H/2 above the cubic and line 2H behind the cubic (Fig. 6 ). The negative simulated velocity at the lower part of the line 2H means the RNG model predicts a larger separation region. In its wake the vortex-shedding effects, which promote momentum exchange and thereby shorten the separation region, are ignored by the steady-state k-e models. Despite the inaccuracies of k-e models in the calculation of flow around a bluff body, the simulation of flow field inside the building and at the windward close to the opening is satisfactory. It justifies our application of the RNG model in the study of the cascade effect on a moderate day without wind or with a gentle breeze.",

The ventilation rate can be calculated by several methods, including the use of empirical models, integration of the velocity across the opening, and tracer gas concentration decay calculation. We adopted the tracer gas step-down method, i.e., the tracer gas decay method, by monitoring the transient evolution of the volume-averaged concentration indoors. This method is believed to be more rational than integration of air velocities because the outdoor air seems to form a short circuit at the opening and the effective depth of fresh air is very limited. Table 1 summarizes the ventilation rates. Because turbulent fluctuation contributes mainly to the air exchange in the wind-driven single-sided natural ventilation, Jiang and Chen [26] concluded that the time-averaged velocity field from k-e model significantly cancels out the instantaneous air exchange between the indoor and outdoor flows. Therefore, the mean ventilation rate is much smaller than the average of instantaneous values from large eddy simulation. In Table 1 , the ventilation rate from large eddy simulation is the highest. However, the result from the tracer gas decay method based on the airflow field predicted by the RNG model agrees with the empirical values. It cannot be judged which method is the best since no credible experimental data are available here.",

It is influenced by window thickness, window height, aspect ratio, room depth and width, and indoor-to-outdoor temperature difference, etc. Generally speaking, a value of 0.6 is a proper approximation. The temporal evolution of air change rate per hour (ACH) and tracer gas decay is compared in Fig. 8(a) and (b) , respectively. The air change rate is derived from two approaches: integrating the normal air velocity across the window and calculation from Eq. (3). The predicted average concentration is in line with the experimental value, both of which accord with the exponential decay law. The air change rate reduces as the indoor-outdoor temperature difference decreases. In both approaches, the ACH is under-predicted. It is suspected that the temperature on the surface of the floor heater is still higher than 33 1C in experiments after electrical heating is turned off so causing a higher indoor air temperature and consequently a higher ACH. It is observed, in both the current simulations (Fig. 9 ) and the flow visualization in the experiments that the cold outdoor air pours into the room and spreads over the floor, behaving like the airflow from a low-velocity diffuser in displacement ventilation. The room air is displaced from the bottom to the top, with a vertical temperature gradient. Compared with upper and lower openings on one fac -ade, single openings normally generate low ventilation rates, and the effective depth of fresh air is not as far into the space [8] .

In principle, the thermal plume above a heat source is not stable because it may laterally oscillate at a certain frequency. In our investigation of the cascade effect, two-dimensional simulations are also performed, and it was found that if there is a wind outside the window blowing vertically upward, alternating indoor air flow patterns were observed at certain critical points of the iterations where aiding force and counter-aiding force are equivalent. The multiple numerical solutions of unstable airflows are not taken into account due to the limited computation resources. Large eddy simulation and transient simulation using two equation models are expected to perform better in these situations. However, they are much more time-consuming.

            "text": "Tracer gas decaying as a function of time is plotted in Fig. 11 . At time \u00bc 0 s, the room is uniformly filled with tracer gas. Then the air exchange through the window is permitted and the normalized volume-average concentration is monitored. Given the previous discussion on pure buoyancy-driven natural ventilation in the validation section, here the emphasis is to explore the combined effect of weak wind and buoyancy on the ACH. As seen from Fig. 11 , a gentle wind up to 1.0 m/s normal to the window has little or no influence on the ACH. However, if the normal wind speed increases to 2.0 and 4.0 m/s, the ACH is remarkably lowered. This finding is supported by the experiment by Wilson and Kiel [29] . In their measurements, at small temperature differences less than 10 1C, a wind speed of 20 km/h measured 10 m above the ground produced flow rates through a sheltered doorway that were about 25% smaller than calm conditions. Based on our present simulations and previous studies, we find that the effects of weak wind are multiple and complicated. Firstly, as explained by Wilson and Kiel [29] , wind increases the intensity of outdoor turbulence, and further increases the interfacial mixing at the middle height of the opening between incoming and outgoing airstreams (Fig. 12) . This mixing lowers the net flow rate. It is the re-entrainment by interfacial mixing that produces the gradual profile of velocity and temperature along the height of the opening. The effect of wind could be evaluated by the Froude number, Fr \u00bc U=\u00f0g 0 h\u00de 1=2 . Davies and Linden's [30] measurement showed that the ACH decreased with increasing Fr. In current cases, Froude number at 3-4 would produce significant reduction on the ACH. Secondly, approaching wind speed profile may attenuate the net pressure difference across the opening (Fig. 13 ). Wind and stack forces counteract each other. The combined effect of opposing wind and buoyancy forces is widely studied in cross ventilation. Nevertheless, there are few reports of single-sided ventilation. Thirdly, turbulent fluctuations in wind contain high frequency energy, which could strengthen the air exchange through the opening [6] . The frequency of turbulence energy for wind-driven flow is one order of magnitude higher than that for buoyancy-driven flow [11, 14] . In buoyancy-driven cases, mean pressure differences across the opening impels airflow while, on the other hand, pressure fluctuation plays an important role in winddriven natural ventilation. In Fig. 11 , the ACH is higher on the second floor than on the third floor at a wind speed of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 m/s. This discrepancy was observed in our field study as well. One possible explanation is that the wind speed at the height of the upper window is higher than at the lower window.",

The wind assists in the cascade effect. If the wind speed increases further to 4.0 m/s, the development of the warm plume from the lower window is confined.

The concentration level is generally 2 orders of magnitude lower in the adjacent upper room than in the lower source room, but the risk of infection is only 1 order of magnitude lower and is still significantly high when it is assessed using the Wells-Riley TB infection model. One of the parameters is the long time that residents would spend at their own homes. The effect of wind blowing perpendicularly to the window is rather complicated. It may reinforce or prevent the upward transport, depending on the wind speed. A gentle-wind forces the warm polluted plume to enter into the upper window by its horizontal momentum. But high-speed winds may function like an air curtain, suppressing the convective spread of pollutants between flats. In spite of these complexities, the vertical spread risks should not be overlooked from the perspective of infection control, especially when an emerging infectious disease is dealt with. Present simulations using the RNG k-e model are not able to reveal the turbulent fluctuations and instantaneous air exchanges through the opening, especially in winddriven single-sided natural ventilation, although we find the value of ACH from the RNG k-e model is acceptable. The symmetrical boundary conditions imposed on the pollutant concentration equations in the horizontal directions may have overestimated the vertical transmission, but the effects are expected to be small, and will be examined in our further studies.",
