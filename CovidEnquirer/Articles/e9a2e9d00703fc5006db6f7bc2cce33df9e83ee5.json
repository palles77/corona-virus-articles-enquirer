This paper studies the benefit of explicitly modeling jumps in this class of models for value at risk (VaR) prediction. Several popular realized volatility models are compared in terms of their VaR forecasting performances through a Monte Carlo study and an analysis based on empirical data of eight Chinese stocks. The results suggest that careful modeling of jumps in realized volatility models can largely improve VaR prediction, especially for emerging markets where jumps play a stronger role than those in developed markets.",

By assuming that market dynamics are completely determined by the behavior of the participants, current realized volatility and the expectations of volatility over longer horizons can effectively form volatility expectations for the next period.

This model decomposes the total daily return variability into the continuous sample path variance, the variation arising from discontinuous jumps and the overnight return variance, and then model and forecast each component respectively. The HAR-CJN model is actually composed of four separate models, including the HAR-C model for the continuous sample path, the ACH model for the probability of jump occurrence, the HAR-J model for the squared jump size and the GARCH-t model for overnight returns. My current study only focusses on the first three models, and leaves modeling of the overnight returns for further research. Like realized volatility models, the HAR-CJN model is able to effectively incorporate intraday data into a reduced form for daily returns. Meanwhile, the HAR-CJN model can approximate long memory well by simply adding together volatility components for different time horizons. Innovatively, the HAR-CJN model attempts to capture the predictability of jumps and the dynamic persistence of jump intensity and jump size by combining the Autoregressive Conditional Hazard (ACH) model and a log-linear model with GARCH errors.",

Since log(0) is undefined, we use log(J t ' + 1) to ensure a well-defined measure that equals zero, when jumps are zero.

ACH model and HAR-J model for jump variation The models for jump variation are composed of two parts: a model for the probability of jumps coupled with a model for the squared jump sizes. The Autoregressive Conditional Duration (ACD) model proposed by Engle and Russell (1998) is a standard way to model the dynamics of variables that are observed at irregular times. Jumps arrive at irregularly spaced time intervals, and their duration is ideally suited to be modeled by an ACD model. However, the ACD model only updates the conditional expected durations on days when jumps arrive. From a forecasting perspective, it is desirable to continuously incorporate new information as it becomes available. The Autoregressive Conditional Hazard (ACH) model of Hamilton and Jorda (2002) was explicitly designed for this purpose. 6 Consider a counting process N(t) representing the number of jump days that have occurred up until day t, with the hazard rate of jump occurrence naturally defined as",

Violation clustering and associated extreme losses incurred in consecutive periods may cause bankruptcy or at least serious financial problems for institutions or individuals.

Under the null hypothesis, the number of violations is not only statistically equal to the desired coverage rate, but also a violation today has no influence on the probability of a violation tomorrow.

This specification nests many of the popular asset price models including Eq. (1) When \u03bb y \u2260 0 but \u03bb v =0, the above equation reduces to Bates' (1996) stochastic volatility model with random jumps occurring in the prices (SVJ). Jump sizes are assumed to be normally distributed as \u03be y \u223c N(\u03bc y ,\u03c3 y 2 ). Essentially, the jump component adds mass to the tail of the return distribution. Increasing \u03c3 y adds tail mass to both tails, while a positive \u03bc y implies relatively less mass in the left tail and vice versa; Eq. (2). When volatility is also allowed to jump, but jumps to prices and volatility are arrived independently, that is, \u03bb y and \u03bb v are two independent Poisson processes, and neither of them are zero, the above equation represents a stochastic volatility independent jumps (SVIJ) model with jump sizes in the price that are normally distributed as \u03be y \u223c N(\u03bc y ,\u03c3 y 2 ) and jump sizes in the volatility are from an exponential distribution \u03be v \u223c exp(\u03bc y ). Eq. (3) When jumps in return and volatility are driven by the same Poisson process, N t y =N t v = N t , and jump sizes in return and volatility are correlated as \u03be v \u223c exp(\u03bc v ) and \u03be y |\u03be v \u223c N(\u03bc y + \u03c1 J \u03be v , \u03c3 y 2 ), the above equation is referred to as stochastic volatility with correlated jump (SVCJ) model. In SVJ model, large price moves stemming from jumps that have no impact on volatility, while the SVCJ specification corrects this shortcoming to allow that price jumps will simultaneously influence both prices and volatility. The added volatility jump component typically adds right skewness in the distribution of volatility, and hence, overall fatten the tails of the return distribution.",

To investigate jump behavior in Chinese market, I report estimation results for the ACH model in Table 7 and estimation results for the HAR-J model in Table 8 for the eight Chinese stocks to analyze their jump intensities and jump sizes. The ACH model presented here only includes the significant explanatory variables and all the insignificant covariates are deleted. I originally experimented with augmenting the ACH (1,1) model by past actual duration and expected duration along with five categories of exogenous variables. The five variables that were added include the logarithm of the number of days until the next news announcements of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the model, which turns out to be the most important macroeconomic variable to influence the stock market in this emerging market. 11 CPI announcement dates were collected from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. We also included the logarithm of the number of days until the next announcement of the firm's earnings report, which is released quarterly and collected from the Shanghai Stock Exchange official website. Unscheduled announcements are included in our analysis as well since insiders may know what and when information will be released, and this can have a potentially high effect on stock prices. In order to accommodate day-of-week effects in the jump occurrences, four weekday dummies for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday were generated and the estimated coefficients in front of them represent the extra probability of jump occurrence relative to Friday. With respect to the specific industry the three individual stocks that belong to, the outbreak of epidemic disease should have an influence on the medicine manufacturing industry. It is well known that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) affected China at the end of 2002 and lasted until the middle of 2003. Therefore, I generate a dummy variable, which equals 1 from January 2, 2003 to July 31, 2003, to observe its effect in jump occurrence. Finally, Nowak (2008) suggested that the length of time since the latest jump could be an additional information component to predict the chance that the jump will show up in the next period, I incorporate this innovative idea in the ACH model and use a step function to measure the no-jump duration L t ,",

The estimated results of the ACH model presented in Table 7 confirm the strong dynamic persistence in jump durations or equivalently the hazard rate of jump occurrence, as the previous literature suggests. The corresponding coefficients of past actual duration and expected duration are both positive and significant. One exciting but not surprising result is that the no-jump duration since the latest jump has a statistically significant positive relationship with the hazard rate of jump occurrence. This suggests that the more no-jump time has passed since the last jump, the more likely that jumps will appear in the next period. However, in contrast to the U.S. fixed-income market in which Andersen et al. (2011) found a statistically significant negative relationship between the hazard rate of jump occurrence and the number of days until the release of macroeconomic announcements, there is no evidence from the estimated results that fundamental information such as released CPI and firm specific news affect the jump hazard rate in these Chinese stocks. Meanwhile, I cannot find a statistically significant day-of-week effect in these three stocks. Table 8 shows the estimated results for the HAR-J model. These clearly indicate a strong persistence in jump size, which is in contrast to findings in previous literature. Early studies in the stochastic volatility literature assume that jump size is identically and independently distributed with no evidence of predictability, and Andersen et al. (2011) found that jump size is statistically influenced by the past one-month continuous sample path variation, but has no significant own persistence. It is not clear yet what drives this difference in the Chinese stocks.",

I assume that the return has a Student-t distribution, 12 since this type of distribution can model the fat tail better than the normal distribution by using a shape parameter \u03bd. Smaller values of \u03bd indicate fatter tail behavior. It is clear that the return equation with realized volatility provided by HAR-CJ and HAR-CJN models in all stocks have relatively large values of \u03bd than other models, which is an evidence that modeling of jumps is able to better describe the tail behavior of returns. In terms of the conditional mean in 11 Andersen et al (2007) suggest that CPI and employment reports, representing the nominal side and real side of the economy respectively, are the two most important macroeconomic news announcements related to financial markets. However, employment reports in emerging markets are unreliable indicators of the real economy because they do not account for selfemployment and underground jobs. 12 The skewed Student-t distribution is popular in the recent literature for VaR forecasting due to its ability to capture both kurtosis and skewness, and to distinguish between the long position and short position VaR risk once the distribution is asymmetric (see Giot and Laurent, 2004) . However, as we have mentioned in Section 2.4, short selling is not permitted in the Chinese stock market. Therefore, our analysis only needs to focus on long position VaR risk, and the Student-t distribution should be adequate in this case. ",

The percentage of return violations above the VaR forecasts provided by all the models for each stock, and P-values of the three tests on the sequence of violations are presented in Tables 10-13. In terms of the unconditional coverage property, it is clear overall that the HAR-CJ model and the HAR-CJN model are fairly well, while the ARMA model and the HAR model are a bit flawed as the p-values of the unconditional coverage test on the VaR forecasts provided by these two models are below 5% significance level for some stocks. The percentage of VaR violations implies that the ARMA model and the HAR model tend to underestimate the extreme point of the return distribution in these flawed cases. As all the realized volatility models do account for volatility clustering, most of them are able to produce i.i.d VaR violations, causing me to not reject independence of the hitting sequences and the accuracy of the conditional coverage for all the models that survive from the unconditional coverage test. 13 Based on the loss functions introduced in Section 3.2.2, Table 14 reports the MSE and MAE for all the realized volatility models with respect to one-step-ahead and five-step-ahead VaR predictions at the 1st and 5th percentile. The noticeable feature of these results is that the HAR-CJN model provides VaR forecasts with the lowest MSE and MAE for all the eight stocks. I use Diebold and Mariano (1995) tests (conducted at the 5% level of significance) to examine two specific questions of interest. First, I want to know whether the explicitly modeling jumps in the realized volatility models lead to VaR forecasts that are statistically superior to those obtained from the models which do not separately consider jumps. I 13 I do not proceed the independence test and conditional coverage test on the models which do not pass the unconditional test. compare the MSE and MAE from the HAR-CJ model and the HAR-CJN model with those from the ARMA model and the HAR model, and find evidence for this in all the eight stocks studied here. These are indicated by superscript (a) if the HAR-CJ model outperforms the ARMA model and the HAR model, and superscript (b) if the HAR-CJN model outperforms the ARMA model and the HAR model in Table 10 . Next, I want to determine whether separate treatment of jump intensities and jump sizes leads to VaR forecasts that are superior to forecasts derived from the model which treats jumps as a single variable. I compare the MSE and MAE from the HAR-CJN model with those that are produced by the HAR-CJ model, and find that the separate treatment of jump intensities and jump size leads to improvement in VaR forecast performance in five out of eight cases. These cases are indicated by superscript (c) in Table 10 . ",

Some previous studies (Andersen et al., 2007a (Andersen et al., ,b,c, 2011 Liao et al., 2010) reveal that decomposing realized volatility into continuous sample path variation and jumps, and separately modeling each component, outperformed the realized volatility models which treat realized volatility as a single variable with respect to out-of-sample realized volatility forecasting. However, some realized volatility models, particularly the ones which do not account for jumps, may be able to provide good mean point forecast, but fail in tail point forecasting. My analysis here explores the ability of four realized volatility models to predict the tail quantiles of the return distribution. In addition, this paper uses Diebold and Mariano (1995) tests of the null that VaR forecasts are equal is rejected at the 5% level of significance. The alternatives are: a) HAR-CJ model provides superior forecasts than ARMA model and HAR model; b) HAR-CJN model provides superior forecasts than ARMA model and HAR model; c) HAR-CJN model superior forecasts than HAR-CJ model. intraday data covering a recent five-year period of eight individual stocks from four different industries in China as an empirical analysis. This provides a good opportunity to examine different jump patterns and how they impact the risk predictive ability of the realized volatility models in an emerging stock market. From the results of the Monte Carlo simulation and the out-of-sample forecasting results in the real-data studies, I find that in some cases, the ARMA model and the HAR model of realized volatility suffer from excessive VaR violations, implying an underestimation of market risk. Most notably, the other two realized volatility models, HAR-CJ model and HAR-CJN model, in which the jump component is explicitly considered, can produce more accurate VaR forecasts. This finding regarding the importance of the jumps is interesting, because it implies that separately modeling jumps and continuous component in realized volatility do indeed improve the description of the tail behavior in asset return distribution.",

Therefore, modeling jumps in realized volatility plays a more important role in risk prediction of this market.
