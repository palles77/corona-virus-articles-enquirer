            "text": "Genetic change was a prerequisite for the early life forms to be generated and maintained (Chapter 1), and it is also a requirement for the evolution of present-day life. We may willingly or inadvertently modify selective pressures, but genetic change is rooted in all replication machineries. The results of genetic modifications, regarding relative dominances of variant forms, are guided by selective pressures and random events. The replicative machinery itself has probably been influenced by natural selection; as an example, polymerases devoid of a capacity to generate variants should have endured a long-term selective disadvantage. However, once the replicative machinery was established, the mechanisms of variation acted independently of the selective pressures applied or to come. Viruses use the same molecular mechanisms of genetic variation than other forms of life: mutation (that encompasses point mutations and insertions-deletions of different lengths), hypermutation, several types of recombination, and genome segment reassortment. Mutation is observed in all viruses, with no known exceptions. Recombination is also widespread, but its role in the generation of diversity appears to vary among viruses. Its occurrence was soon accepted for DNA viruses, but it was considered uncertain for the RNA viruses. Pioneering studies of poliovirus (PV) by P. D. Cooper, V. I. Agol and colleagues, and of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) by A.M. King and colleagues provided the first evidence of recombination in RNA. The present perception is that recombination is more widespread than thought only a few decades ago and that its frequency and the types of genomic forms it generates are varied among viruses. For example, it appears that positivestrand RNA viruses recombine more easily than negative-strand RNA viruses to give rise to mosaic genomes of standard length. Several negative-strand RNA viruses, however, can yield defective genomes through recombination, frequently characterized by deletions in their RNA. A connection between the structure of replication complexesdas viewed by X-ray diffraction or high-resolution cryo-electron microscopydand the propensity to produce defective genomes has not been established. Defective genomes are increasingly perceived not only as unavoidable side-products of blind replicative imperfections but as classes of genome subpopulations that perform relevant biological roles for the standard, infectious viruses. Genome segment reassortment, a type of variation close to chromosomal exchanges in sexual reproduction, is an adaptive asset of segmented viral genomes, as continuously evidenced by the ongoing evolution of the influenza viruses. The three modes of virus genome variation are not incompatible, and reassortantrecombinant-mutant genomes are continuously arising in present-day viruses. The potential for genetic variation of RNA and DNA viral genomes is remarkable, and it is the ultimate molecular mechanism that lies at the origin of the virus diversity delineated in Chapter 1.",

One of the types of electronic redistribution leads to tautomeric changes, such as the keto-enol and amino-imino transitions, which modify the hydrogen-bonding properties of the base; tautomeric imino and enol forms of the standard bases can produce non-Watson-Crick pairs. The proportion of the alternative tautomeric forms can be influenced by modifications in the purine and pyrimidine rings, which, in turn, can favor either the syn or anti conformation of a nucleoside, which is defined by the torsion angle of the bond between the 1 0 carbon of the ribose and either N1 in pyrimidines or N9 in purines ( Fig. 2.1) . The anti-conformation is usually the most stable in standard nucleotides and polynucleotides.

            "text": "Base-base interactions are not only responsible for part of the mutations that occur during genome replication, but also for the formation of double-stranded nucleic acids, either within the same polynucleotide chain or between two different chains. Transitions from a coil-like into an organized double-stranded (or other) structure are functionally relevant for both RNA and DNA. In the case of RNA, doublestranded regions in the adequate alternation with single-stranded regions, determine key catalytic or macromolecule-attracting abilities, as for example, ribozyme activities (Chapter 1), the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of several viral and cellular mRNAs, or multitudes of functional RNA-protein interactions (Denny and Greenleaf, 2018) . Adjacent base stacking due to electronic interactions (rather than hydrophobic bonds as once thought), contribute also to the stability of double-helical regions in nucleic acid molecules. Structural transitions due to alternative stacking conformations, particularly within polypurine or polypyrimidine tracts, can affect nucleic acidprotein interactions. In turn, replication machineries (typically including viral and host proteins gathered in membrane structures) may also be affected by nucleic acid conformations; such effects are important in virology regarding consequences for mutant generation in a given template sequence context. These considerations on structural transitions are relevant to the nonneutral character of silent (also termed synonymous) mutations (those in open-reading frames that do not result in an amino acid substitution), a point to be addressed in the next section. Transitions from a single-stranded into a doublestranded nucleic acid structure and the relative stability of the two forms depend on multiple factors that include the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid, its being a ribo-or a deoxyribosepolynucleotide, temperature, ionic environment, and ionic strength. Positively charged counterions neutralize negatively charged phosphates, and favor duplex stability [as an overview of FIGURE 2.2 Examples of a class of non-Watson-Crick base pairs termed wobble base pairs. The drawing is similar to that of Fig. 2 .1, except that the sugar residues and phosphodiester bonds have been omitted.

The terms quasi-neutral or nearly-neutral may seem ambiguous to molecular biologists. However, in the formulation of the neutral theory they had a precise meaning of the selection coefficient (a parameter that measures fitness differences) being lower than the inverse of the effective population size, with minor variations in the equations of some formulations (Kimura, 1983) . Despite random drift of genomes playing an important role in molecular evolution, evidence gathered over the last decades renders untenable the assumption that synonymous mutations are neutral. Evidence to the contrary has been obtained with viruses and cells, including mutations in the human genome that may affect enhancer functions (Hirsch and Birnbaum, 2015) , mRNA folding (Faure et al., 2017; Mittal et al., 2018) , and microRNA targeting (Brest et al., 2011) , among other processes (Novella, 2004; Novella et al., 2004; Parmley et al., 2006; Hamano et al., 2007; Resch et al., 2007; Lafforgue et al., 2011; Nevot et al., 2011 Nevot et al., , 2018 Supek, 2016) . There are several mechanisms by which synonymous mutations can affect virus behavior: alteration of cis-acting regulatory elements in viral genomes, decrease of the stability of duplex structures within the RNA genome or between viral sequences and miRNAs or siRNAs, or changes of viral gene expression [splicing precision or translation fidelity through the modification of RNA-RNA or RNA-protein interactions; reviewed in (Mart\u00ednez et al., 2016) ].",

Thus, the rate of protein synthesis, an important phenotypic trait for cells and viruses, can be affected by the frequency of alternative synonymous codons present in mRNAs (Richmond, 1970; Akashi, 2001) . Not only codon bias, but also specific codons or codon combinations may affect ribosome speed to regulate the folding of nascent proteins during translation (Makhoul and Trifonov, 2002; Rocha, 2004; Aragones et al., 2010; Brule and Grayhack, 2017) . As a consequence, generation of rare codons by mutation of abundant codons (or vice versa) can modify viral fitness (Chapter 5). Rare codons may also limit the fidelity of amino acid incorporation when the frequency of the required aminoacyl-tRNAS is low (Ling et al., 2009; Zaher and Green, 2009; Czech et al., 2010) . The frequency of codon pairs in RNA genomes is also a fitness determinant relevant to the preparation of attenuated viral vaccines.",

The effect of evolutionary distance on the transition to transversion ratio was observed in the FMDV genome sequence comparisons carried out in our laboratory over several decades, that ranged from analyses of mutant spectra relative to their corresponding consensus sequence to independent viral isolates from disease outbreaks separated by several decades [review of the work on FMDV evolution in (Domingo et al., 1990 (Domingo et al., , 2003 ].

(ii) In the course of evolution, important but transient events of positive selection (termed episodic positive selection) due to one or a few amino acid substitutions may be accompanied by a larger number of synonymous, tolerated mutations. In this situation, u computes as u < 1, thus indicative of purifying selection despite a critical role of positive selection triggered by one or few nonsynonymous mutations in the evolutionary outcome (Crandall et al., 1999) . (iii) In a striking proof of the above arguments, statistically significant mutational biases led to a value of u indicative of positive selection in an in vitro evolution experiment simulating pseudogene evolution in which positive selection was not possible (Vartanian et al., 2001) ; this study represents a warning which is rarely mentioned when discussing the limitations of conclusions based on the value of u. (iv) A synonymous change may permit the mutant codon to acquire a relevant nonsynonymous change through a point mutation. The term quasisynonymous has been used to describe codons that encode the same amino acid, but that has a different evolutionary potential regarding the amino acids that they can access through a point mutation. Alternative codons for a given amino acid approximate a replicative system to points of sequence space from which a phenotypically relevant change has a different probability (Chapters 3 and 4).",

A mutation rate for a genomic site measures a biochemical event dictated by the replication machinery and environmental parameters that affect the catalytic properties of the polymerase. In contrast, a mutant (or mutation) frequency describes the proportion of a mutant (or a set of mutants) in a genome population. The frequency of a mutant will depend on the rate at which it is generated (given by the mutation rate) and on its replication capacity relative to other genomes in the population (Drake and Holland, 1999) (Fig. 2 .5). A specific mutation may be produced at a modest rate, but then be found at high frequency because the mutation is advantageous for genome replication in that environment. The converse situation may also occur. Some mutational hot spots (in the sense of genomic sites where mutations tend to occur with high probability) may never be reflected among the repertoire of mutations found in a 2.5 Mutation rates and frequencies for DNA and RNA genomes genome population because of the selective disadvantage they inflict upon the genome harboring them.",

The homopolymeric tract constitutes a hot spot for variation due to polymerase slippage ( Fig. 2 .4B). The elongation of the internal oligoadenylate was dramatic because it sextuplicated the number of adenylate residues present at that site; it was only observed when FMDV was subjected to repeated plaque-to-plaque (bottleneck) transfers, not large population passages. In fact, this drastic genetic modification has not been recorded among natural isolates of the virus. The molecular instruction to elongate the oligoadenylate was very strong because it was observed in many independent biological clones subjected to bottleneck transfers (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1996) . Despite qualifying as a hot spot for variation, the first event in fitness recovery when the clones were subjected to large population passages was the reversion of the elongated tract to its original size (Escarm\u00eds et al., 1999) . The interpretation of these findings, to be further analyzed in Chapter 6, is that during plaque-to-plaque transfers the negative selection to eliminate unfit genomes is less intense than during large, highly competitive population passages. Again, a clear molecular instruction to elongate a homopolymeric track may not be reflected in a high frequency of the affected genomes. Therefore, although mutation rates and frequencies for viruses bear some relationship, rates cannot be inferred from frequencies and vice versa ( Fig. 2 .5).",

Drake, who pursued comparative measurements that have generally supported a difference between mutation rates for DNA and RNA viruses. The rates estimated for bacteriophages l and T4 were about 100 times higher than those of their host E. coli. An approximately constant rate of 0.003 mutations per genome per replication round was calculated for a number of DNA-based microbes (Drake, 1991) , an observation sometimes referred to as \"Drake's rule.\" This rather surprising constancy suggests that different DNA organisms have accommodated the template-copying fidelity of their replication machineries to achieve a narrow window in the mutational load measured as mutations fixed per genome, a remarkable fitting of biochemistry with evolutionary needs. The basal mutation rate in mammalian cells has been estimated at about 10 \u00c010 substitutions per nucleotide and cell generation [reviewed in (Naegeli, 1997; Domingo et al., 2001; Friedberg et al., 2006) ] (Table 2 .1).",

The latter value is in agreement with a rate of 3 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 to 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c010 substitutions per base pair and generation based on wholegenome deep sequencing of an experimentally evolved lineage of Myxococcus xanthus (Velicer et al., 2006) . There are biological phyla for which no mutation rates have been calculated. From current knowledge, we can assume that mutation rates in cells and viruses depend on the replicative machinery (generally a multiprotein complex that includes the relevant viral polymerase with additional viral and host proteins and membrane structures) and on multiple environmental parameters (template nucleotide sequence context, ionic environment, temperature, metabolites in interaction with components of the replication apparatus, etc.). Whether bacteria are in the exponential or stationary phase of growth can affect intracellular metabolites and proton exchange rates which, in turn, may alter the proportion of tautomeric forms in nucleotides and misincorporation tendencies (Friedberg et al., 2006) . The sequence context of the template nucleic acids (presence of repeated sequences that can induce misalignment mutagenesis or G-C vs. A-T rich regions in relation to relative nucleotide substrate abundances, etc.) may impel or attenuate mutability. Insertion elements may enhance mutation rates at neighboring sites in a bacterial genome (Miller and Day, 2004) . Despite these influences, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) displayed comparable mutation rates in several host cells (Combe and Sanjuan, 2014) suggesting that there is a limited range of average error rates needed for a virus to maintain fitness (Chapters 5 and 9).",

Even the extremely complex human genome shows genetic instability at specific loci, some associated with genetic disease (Domingo et al., 2001; Alberts et al., 2002; Bushman, 2002) . Genome size is a parameter pertinent to biological behavior, not only because it imposes a commensurate copying fidelity, but also because it affects the impact of genetic heterogeneity within infected organisms and upon the invasion of new hosts (Chapter 3). Mutation frequencies measured by subjecting virus to a specific selective agent (e.g., mutants that escape the neutralizing activity of a monoclonal antibody or mutants that escape inhibition by a drug) span a broad range of values (10 \u00c0 3 to 10 \u00c0 8 ) for DNA and RNA viruses (Smith and Inglis, 1987; Sarisky et al., 2000; Domingo et al., 2001) (Table 2 .1). The technical details of any procedure used to calculate a mutation frequency should be carefully evaluated to translate its meaning to the genome level. Important variables are the efficacy of the antibody or drug (which will be concentration-dependent) or the possibility of phenotypic hiding-mixing in the escape mutants to be quantified (Holland et al., 1989; Valcarcel and Ortin, 1989) . Unexpected low levels of escape mutants (that would imply < 10 \u00c06 substitutions per nucleotide) for an RNA virus can mean either a general or sitespecific high polymerase fidelity, a selective disadvantage of the genome that harbors the mutation or, when a phenotypic alteration is measured, the requirement of two or more mutations to produce the alteration. Conversely, a high mutation frequency for a DNA virus whose replication is catalyzed by a high-fidelity DNA polymerase may mean that either repair activities were not functional or that the mutant displayed a selective advantage and overgrew the wild type prior to the measurement of its frequency. Mathematical treatments that take into account reversion of a low fitness mutant and its competition with wild-type virus have been used to calculate mutation rates (Batschelet et al., 1976; Coffin, 1990) .",

It is used to mean mutation frequency, rate of evolution, and sometimes to mean mutation rate in its real sense (as explained in Section 2.5). A particularly risky habit is to use mutation rate when what is measured is a mutation frequency. Some studies have claimed that they have a replication system devoid of selection, and therefore, the number of mutations counted corresponds to the true mutation rate of the system. This is incorrect. There is no replicative system devoid of selection because at least selection to maintain replication is in continuous operation. Furthermore, as taught by quasispecies dynamics (Stadler, 2016) , supported by mutational waves in hepatitis C virus upon prolonged replication in a constant cellular environment (Moreno et al., 2017) , the mutant spectrum per se is part of the environment. Since the mutant spectrum is constantly changing, so is the environment in which replication takes place. Unfortunately, some studies have proposed the existence of mutational cold spots (sites at which mutations as a biochemical event occur at a very low frequency) ignoring that negative selection might have eliminated newly arising mutations. These false conclusions imply the existence of genomic regions particularly suitable as drug or antibody targets because they cannot mutate. These are the types of studies and incorrect conclusions that keep perpetuating the problem of control of viral diseases by encouraging antiviral and vaccine designs doomed to failure (Chapters 8 and 9).",

The change in fidelity can reach almost one order of magnitude, but virus viability is not compromised. Thus, error rates themselves can be subjected to selection, as supported by theoretical studies on evolvability (Earl and Deem, 2004) . Early studies documented heterogeneity in the mutation rates among individual plaque isolates of influenza A virus (Suarez et al., 1992) . It is not clear whether mutation rates of viruses have evolved to procure a balance between adaptability and genetic stability, or whether other selective constraints have imposed the observed values. It has been suggested that because of the generally deleterious nature of most mutations, the adaptive value of the high mutation rates for RNA viruses is debatable and that there might have been a trade-off between replication rate and copying fidelity (Elena and Sanjuan, 2005) . Mutation rates would be a consequence of rapid RNA replication, and an increase in copying fidelity would come at a 2.6 Evolutionary origins, evolvability, and consequences of high mutation rates: fidelity mutants cost, resulting in a lower replication rate. A connection between elongation and error rate has been suggested by results with some viral and cellular polymerases [review (Kunkel and Erie, 2005) ]. In an early study with the poliovirus RdRp in vitro, an increase in the error frequency was observed when the pH and Mg 2\u00fe ion conditions were modified, and the decreased fidelity correlated with increased RNA elongation rate (Ward et al., 1988) . A possible connection between elongation rate and copying fidelity cannot be ruled out, but current evidence points to template-copying fidelity as being the result of multiple factors, not necessarily linked to the rate of genome replication (Vignuzzi and Andino, 2010; Campagnola et al., 2015; Domingo and Perales, 2019) .",

A poliovirus mutant, whose RdRp displayed a three-to fivefold higher fidelity than the wild-type enzyme, replicated at a slightly lower rate than wild-type virus in cell culture but displayed a strong selective disadvantage regarding the invasion of the brain of susceptible mice (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006) . The impediment to cause neuropathology was due at least partly to the limited complexity of the mutant spectrum since its broadening through mutagenesis restored the capacity to produce neuropathology. These and other studies have provided evidence that mutant spectrum complexity, by virtue of its impact on fitness, can be a virulence determinant. The work by M. Vignuzzi, J. Pfeiffer, R. Andino, C. Cameron, K. Kirkegaard, and their colleagues on poliovirus fidelity mutants opened a much-needed branch of research in virus evolution and quasispecies implications. As proof of this statement, the field of fidelity mutants is rapidly expanding (Border\u00eda et al., 2016) , and references to the information they provide will be made in several chapters.",

The coronaviruses have the largest genomes among the known RNA viruses, with 30e33 kb. This is about 10-fold more genetic information than encoded in the simple RNA bacteriophages, such as MS2 or Qb. Coronaviruses are replicated by complex RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which include a domain that corresponds to a 3 0 e5 0 exonuclease, proofreading-repair activity. The protein displays exonuclease activity in vitro, and its inactivation affects viral RNA synthesis (Minskaia et al., 2006) , and results in increases of about 15-fold in the average mutation frequency (Eckerle et al., 2007 (Eckerle et al., , 2010 . A coronavirus mutant devoid of this repair function is more susceptible to lethal mutagenesis than the corresponding, nonmutated virus , as expected from a connection between replication accuracy and proximity to an error threshold for the maintenance of genetic information (Chapter 9). Thus, it is likely that a proofreading activity evolved (or was captured from a cellular counterpart) in RNA genomes, whose genomic complexity was in the limit compatible with the fidelity achievable by standard RNA replicases. It would be interesting to discover new RNA viruses with a single RNA molecule longer than 30 Kb as a genome to analyze whether they have evolved more accurate core polymerases or exhibit a proofreading-repair function during replication. Toward the other end of the RNA size scale, viroid RNAs display a mutation rate higher than (or close to the highest) recorded for RNA viruses, consistent with the correlation between genome size and template-copying accuracy (Gago et al., 2009) .",

It has been estimated that during E. coli DNA replication the error rate would be 10 \u00c01 to 10 \u00c02 mutations per nucleotide copied if accuracy relied only upon the strength of interactions provided by base pairing (Section 2.2). The error rate would decrease to 10 \u00c05 to 10 \u00c06 with base selection and proofreading-repair, to about 10 \u00c07 with the contribution of additional proteins present in the replication complex, and to about 10 \u00c010 misincorporations per nucleotide with the participation of postreplicative mismatch correction mechanisms (Naegeli, 1997; Kunkel and Erie, 2005; Friedberg et al., 2006) . Reduction of bacterial genome size results in the increase of mutation frequency (Nishimura et al., 2017) . The error rate of the bacteriophage f29 DNA polymerase is about 10 \u00c06 without the proofreading exonuclease activity, and it decreases to 10 \u00c08 with the correcting activity [(de Vega et al., 2010) and references therein]. Postreplicative repair pathways act on double-stranded DNA, but not (or very inefficiently) on RNA or DNA-RNA hybrids. Therefore, the known postreplicative repair systems that operate in cellular DNA do not make a significant contribution to error correction in RNA viruses (Steinhauer et al., 1992) .",

Exceptions to the absence of repair activities in simple genetic elements have been described. A satellite RNA of the plant virus turnip crinkle carmovirus evolved a 3 0 -end RNA repair mechanism. It implicates the synthesis of short oligoribonucleotides by the viral replicase using the 3 0 -end of the viral genome as a template. The mechanism consists probably of template-independent priming at the 3 0 -end of the damaged RNA to generate wild type, negative strand, and satellite RNA (Nagy and Simon, 1997) . A reversible, NTP-dependent excision of the 3 0 residue of the nascent nucleic acid product has been described in some retroviruses and hepatitis C virus (Meyer et al., 1998; Jin et al., 2013) . This activity is important for drug resistance, and it may also modulate the overall fidelity of some polymerases. It cannot be excluded that some type of point mutation correction may operate in RNA genetic elements of less than 30 Kb. Such putative mechanisms may even diminish mutation rates that would otherwise be prohibitively deleterious, and they do not overshadow high mutation rates as a feature of RNA and some DNA genomes (Table 2 .1).",

Three-dimensional structures of viral RdRps and RTs indicate that interactions between the incoming nucleotide or residues of the template-primer with amino acids of the polymerase must permit displacement of the growing polymerase chain along 2.6 Evolutionary origins, evolvability, and consequences of high mutation rates: fidelity mutants On the left, the Klenow fragment is represented with colored fingers, palm and thumb domains, next to an open right hand.

The left panel is a front view of the complex, depicting the polymerase chain as a yellow ribbon, the RNA in dark blue (template) and cyan (primer). The incoming UTP and the pyrophosphate product are shown in atom type, and 2 Mg 2 \u00fe ions as magenta balls. The right panel is the same complex in a top-down orientation. (Figure courtesy of C. Ferrer-Orta and N. Verdaguer). (C) Scheme of the minimum number of steps involved in nucleotide incorporation. The first step consists of the binding of polymerase 0 E to the template-primer R n (elongated up to nucleotide n) to form a complex 0 ER n . Formation of the activated complex ER n is governed by the rate of constant k assembly (k a ). The activated ER n complex binds a nucleotide NTP with an apparent binding affinity given by K d,app to form the ER n NTP complex. Catalysis to covalently incorporate the NTP to the growing primer chain to yield ER n\u00fe1 and pyrophosphate (PP i ) is governed by the rate constant k pol . Other constants depicted in the scheme are the inactivation rate constant (k inact ) of 0 E, and dissociation of E from RNA (k off, ER n and k off , ER n\u00fe1 ).

One of the several steps involved in nucleotide incorporation is the formation of a ternary complex (polymerase with templateprimer and the incoming nucleotide) that undergoes a conformational change (reorientation of the divalent ion-complexed triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide). This conformational change activates the complex for phosphoryl transfer, to link the nucleosidemonophosphate to the 3 0 -terminus of the primer (or growing chain). Steps involved in the nucleotide incorporation are represented in Fig. 2 .6C. Both the conformational change and the relative rate of phosphoryl transfer for an incorrect nucleotide versus the correct nucleotide influence the error rate at each site of the growing chain. Critical kinetic constants in Fig. 2 .6C that are determined experimentally to quantify relative nucleotide incorporations and misincorporations are K d,app (expressed as mM), k pol (expressed as s \u00c01 ), and the ratio k pol /K d,app (mM \u00c01 s \u00c01 ) termed the catalytic efficiency. The ratio of k pol /K d,app for the incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide to k pol /K d,app for a correct nucleotide gives the frequency of that particular misincorporation, and an assessment of polymerase fidelity [ (Castro et al., 2005) and references therein]. Modifications of polymerase residues by site-directed mutagenesis, combined with comparisons of the relevant structures, have identified critical amino acid residues involved in template-copying fidelity.",

Structural modifications of viral polymerases that lead to high fidelity have inspired the design of mutant viral polymerases displaying either an increase or decrease of copying fidelity achieved through a single amino acid substitution (Wainberg et al., 1996; Men endez-Arias, 2002; Mansky et al., 2003; Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003; Arnold et al., 2005; Domingo, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006; Coffey et al., 2011; Gnadig et al., 2012; Meng and Kwang, 2014; Rozen-Gagnon et al., 2014; Borderia et al., 2016) .

Biased hypermutation was first observed in some defective interfering (DI) RNAs of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Holland et al., 1982) , and in variant forms of measles virus, associated with postmeasles neurological disease, such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Cattaneo and Billeter, 1992) . Hypermutation is mainly due to the activity of cellular deaminases, such as the apolipoprotein B mRNA and the editing complex (APOBEC), or the adenosine deaminase acting on doublestranded RNA (ADAR) families, that are involved in cellular editing and regulatory functions (Sheehy et al., 2002; Santiago and Greene, 2008; Nishikura, 2010; Stavrou et al., 2014; Pfaller et al., 2018; Venkatesan et al., 2018) . In the event of a viral infection, such cellular functions can become part of an innate defense mechanism against the invading virus. Viral proteins (i.e., Vif in HIV-1) bind some APOBEC proteins, thus inhibiting mutagenesis and permitting virus survival (Sheehy et al., 2002) . In oncoretroviruses, retroviruses, and hepatitis B virus (HBV), the APOBEC-3 cytidine deaminase acts on singlestranded DNA and results mainly in G / A and C / U hypermutation, that may affect 40% e100% of the G residues. The preferred sequence context for G hypermutation in HIV-1 observed in vivo is GpA > GpG > GpT z GpC. The specific dinucleotide context of the hypermutated sites provides a means to distinguish genomes that have undergone hypermutation by cellular activities from those that are heavily mutated by other mechanisms, such as the action of mutagenic agents (Chapter 9). APOBEC 3 proteins play a role in cancer through cytidine deaminase mutagenesis and generation of double-strand breaks in chromosomal DNA (Wang et al., 2016) . APOBEC 3 levels in the cell may be regulated by cellular and viral proteins, for example, human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein E that stabilizes APOBEC 3A in human keratinocytes that may promote cervical cancer (Westrich et al., 2018) .",

Molecular basis of genetic variation of viruses: error-prone replication virus mutants obtained by molecular cloning of a biological sample, or constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. A transition mutation that causes a strong fitness decrease but that still allows residual RNA genome replication will most likely revert following infection or transfection of cells with the mutant construct and subsequent viral replication. Double or triple mutants (preferentially including transversions) should be engineered (when possible according to the genetic code) to study the behavior of a viral mutant with an amino acid replacement of interest that may produce a fitness decrease. As an example, a C / U transition found in an open reading frame of an RNA virus may convert a Pro into a Ser (CCG / UCG). Since Ser will revert to Pro through a U / C transition in the triplet (a common type of misincorporation by most polymerases), Ser should be engineered to be encoded by AGU; in the course of replication, reversion to Pro would require at least two transversions since the codons for Pro are CCU, CCC, CCA, or CCG. Thus, if effects derived from the difference in the primary sequence of the RNA or codon bias do not intervene in the behavior of the viral genome, codons with a high genetic barrier to reversion should be engineered for studies involving viral replication.",

High mutation rates also imply that infection or transfection with debilitated mutant viruses may result in progeny with sequences that differ from the input. V. I. Agol and colleagues have coined the term quasi-infectious to refer to mutant viruses that are capable of yielding progeny, but the progeny differs from the initial genome (pseudorevertants) (Gmyl et al., 1993; Agol and Gmyl, 2018) . The difference between the input mutant and the rescued progeny virus will depend on the type of genetic lesion in the input virus and its consequences for virus multiplication. A single point mutation that decreases replication is likely to evolve to yield a true revertant (return to the original sequence) upon replication. If the same reversion depends on two or more mutations, a true revertant will require extended replication for exploration of sequence space (Chapter 3), and selection of compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome (sometimes referred to as second site revertants) becomes an alternative for fitness gain. The term compensatory applies to mutations that compensate for the deleteriousness of other mutations. A typical example is a mutation that decreases the stability of a stem in an RNA stem-loop that functions as a cis-acting element. A compensatory mutation restores a stable stem needed for the activity. Transfection of cells by an engineered virus with some preselected genetic modification (produced either from cDNA copies of a viral genome or by chemical synthesis) may yield progeny genomes, which differ from the parent. If a substantial loss of replicative capacity is produced by a drastic genetic change (an indel, loss of a stem-loop structure, etc.) selection of a true revertant becomes extremely unlikely. The compensatory generation of alternative structures (or constellations of point mutations) that restores replication (partially or completely) becomes an interesting and informative possibility.",

This is because, while some constellations of mutations may be compatible with infectivity, others may not, or may allow limited, suboptimal replication, thus favoring the selection of additional mutations or reversions. The same applies to a synthetic genome based on one of the multiple genomic sequences from a viral 2.8 Error-prone replication and maintenance of genetic information: instability of laboratory viral constructs isolate. Individual mutations may be detrimental either per se, or by the combined presence of other mutations. The joint effect of different mutations in the same genome is often referred to as epistasis. Mutations that reinforce each other with regard to a viral function are said to produce positive epistasis, and those that interfere with each other produce negative epistasis (also mentioned in Section 2.3). Epistasis in RNA viruses may be blurred by the weight of mutant spectra in determining viral behavior through intergenomic interactions (Chapter 3).",

Engineered f29 DNA polymerases provide a powerful amplification tool in genomics (de Vega et al., 2010) .

It implicates multiple viral gene products (DNA polymerase, single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, processivity factors, helicase-primase, eukaryotic topoisomerase I, etc.), and a succession of protein-catalyzed steps (Czarnecki and Traktman, 2017) . In the copy choice (or template switching) mechanism, the nascent DNA switches from one template molecule to another, resulting in the synthesis of recombinant, daughter DNAs. In its basic form, recombination by breakage and rejoining starts with the introduction of a nick at one of the strands of each parental DNA, strand invasion of one parental DNA by the other, branch migration, ligation at the nicks (linking DNA strands from the two parents), and further isomerization and cleavage reactions. DNA recombination is responsible for the endonuclease-mediated isomerization of herpesvirus genomes [four isomers defined by the orientation of the long (L) and short (S) regions of the viral genome]. During the late phase of herpes simplex virus-1 replication, the frequency of recombination has been estimated at 0.6% per Kb of the genome . Integration or excision of proviral DNA or temperate bacteriophage DNA, are examples of site-specific recombination that involves specific enzyme activities (i.e., retroviral integrases), and requires a short stretch of nucleotide sequence identity.",

An RNA polymerase molecule with its nascent RNA product jumps into the corresponding position of another template molecule, to complete synthesis of the RNA product ( Fig. 2.7) . Given the large numbers of viral genomes often present in replication complexes (also termed replication factories) in each infected cell, it is not surprising that this mechanism may give rise to frequent recombinant progeny genomes. Formation of mosaic genomes has long been recognized as an essential feature of the genetics of some retroviruses and plant RNA viruses. For HIV-1 and some plant RNA viruses recombination frequencies have been estimated at 2%e10% of progeny per 100 nucleotides; for picornaviruses and coronaviruses the number of recombinants amounts to 10%e20% of the progeny (King, 1988; Lai, 1992; Nagy and Simon, 1997; Levy et al., 2004; Urbanowicz et al., 2005; Sztuba-Solinska et al., 2011) . Using a phylogenetic approach the average recombination rate of HIV-1 in vivo was estimated in 1.4 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 recombination events/site/generation, which is about fivefold greater than the average point mutation rate (Shriner et al., 2004) . A ten-fold lower value of 1.4 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 recombination events/site/ 2.9 Recombination in DNA and RNA viruses generation was estimated from the changes in the genetic composition of HIV-1 within single patients (Neher and Leitner, 2010) . Recombination is required for HIV-1 replication and genome integrity (Rawson et al., 2018) . In negative-strand RNA viruses recombination may be inefficient or absent, but some of them can display homologous recombination (Plyusnin et al., 2002) , and a high rate of generation of DI RNAs and other types of defective genomes (Roux et al., 1991; Rezelj et al., 2018) .",

A decrease of intracellular nucleotide levels as a result of treatment of cells with hydroxyurea may favor template switching reflected in an increase of intra and intermolecular recombination (Pfeiffer et al., 1999; Svarovskaia et al., 2000) . Homologous RNA recombination can also be influenced by amino acid substitutions in the polymerase, the primary sequence in the RNA (i.e., high frequency of template switching in AU-rich regions), the sequence identity between the nascent strand and acceptor template, and secondary structures at or around the crossover sites, among other influences (Nagy and Simon, 1997; Agol, 2010; Agol and Gmyl, 2018) . Since recombination necessitates coinfections of the same cell by at least two parental genomes, the persistence of a viral genome in a cell increases the likelihood of sequential coinfections, unless some reinfection or superinfection exclusion mechanism operates [(Webster et al., 2013) and references therein]. Without such restrictions, persistently infected cells may be an environment with a higher probability of recombination than transiently infected cells, assuming comparable genome loads at the sites of replication.",

A commonly used procedure measures similarity values between sequences using a sliding-window scanning method. The recombination crossover point (where the two parental sequences meet) is identified by the point (or region) where the similarity plot crosses from one sequence into another (Salemi and Vandamme, 2004; Martin et al., 2005; Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006 , Perez-Losada et al., 2015 . Crossover points along a viral genome are not distributed at random, either because polymerase detachment from the template is sequence-dependent or because many of the recombination events do not lead to viable progeny. Absence of recombinant viability introduces a parallel with the distinction between mutation rate and mutation frequency (Section 2.5); that is, a difference between what does occur at the biochemical level during replication and what is subsequently observed upon analysis of the replication products. Newly arising recombinants may be subjected to negative selection, and only a viable subset might be detectable in the progeny virus (King, 1988; Lai, 1992 ). An elegant study by D. J. Evans and colleagues documented \"imprecise\" enterovirus recombinant intermediates that were lost upon serial virus passage (Lowry et al., 2014) . Recombination is viewed as a biphasic process consisting of initial imprecise events followed by a stage of resolution in favor of fit recombinants.",

In the case of the nanovirus Faba bean necrotic stunt virus, its eight segments vary in frequency in a hostdependent manner (Sicard et al., 2013) . This observation led the authors to propose a \"setpoint genome formula,\" which may reflect the control of segment (gene) copy number that may provide some still unrecognized benefit to the multipartite phenotype (see next Section 2.11). In principle, replication of multipartite viruses requires that each cell be coinfected by at least one of each type of particle harboring a different genome type, which in fact represents a remarkable cost for replicative efficiency. The fact that unsegmented and segmented RNA viruses are well represented in our biosphere suggests that neither of the two organizations confers a definitive and general advantage for long-term survival.",

            "text": "An experimental system of genome segmentation is available with the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Its single-stranded RNA genome underwent a modification akin to genome segmentation when the standard virus was subjected to 260 passages in BHK-21 cells at high multiplicity of infection. The experiment was originally intended to investigate the limits of fitness gain following prolonged multiplication in a defined environment, in this case, BHK-21 cells in culture. The starting FMDV had not been well adapted to the BHK-21 cell culture environment since it derived from a diseased swine during a disease outbreak, and it was minimally propagated in BHK-21 cells to obtain a biological clone by plaque isolation. Upon extensive replication of the clone in BHK-21 cells, the virus evolved toward a bipartite genome (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004) . Each of the two pieces of RNA that composed the bipartite (or segmented) genome version contained in-frame deletions affecting trans-acting proteins ( Fig. 2.8) . Each segment in isolation could not infect cells productively, but, when present together, they were infectious by complementation, and killed cells in the absence of standard FMDV. A low multiplicity of infection rapidly selected the full-length genome as a result of recombination of the two parental, defective segments (Garc\u00eda-Arriaza et al., 2004) . The particles containing the shortened RNA were thermally more stable than the standard particles (Ojosnegros et al., 2011) , but this difference did not explain the initial trigger of the segmentation event. The solution to this question came with the demonstration that the transition toward genome segmentation was possible because of an extensive exploration of the mutational sequence space by the standard virus. Indeed, the mutations that accumulated during serial passages enhanced the fitness of the segmented genome version to a much higher extent than the fitness of the standard genome (Moreno et al., 2014) (Fig. 2.8) . Thus, gradual evolution (drift in sequence space) was a requirement for the major transition toward segmentation, thus adding reassortment to mutation and recombination as potential mechanisms of genetic variation of this laboratory-adapted picornavirus. Cooperation and complementation are discussed in Section 3.8 of Chapter 3.",

A mutation is a universal form of genetic change. It underlies numerous adaptive responses and critical biological transitions in viruses, and it is a prerequisite for recombination and reassortment to have a biological impact. If mutations were not present in different template molecules during replication, recombinants with the crossover point at equivalent positions of the parental genomes would be \"silent,\" and display the same behavior as the parental genomes.

Intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants play a key role in current HIV-1 diversification, with around 100 circulating recombinant forms (and the number is growing) displaying complex mosaic structures (multiple crossover sites) (Thomson et al., 2002; Gerhardt et al., 2005) . In addition, other HIV-1 recombinants have been characterized that are not established epidemiologically. Fewer HCV recombinants have been identified, but the number is likely to increase as the virus diversifies in nature. Positive selection of HIV-1 recombinants that unite different drug-resistant mutations in the same genome offers an example of the conservative force of recombination to rescue fit viruses in the face of a strong selective constraint (Men endez- Arias, 2002) . Recombination is expected to play an increasing role in the spread of drug resistance among viruses for which new antiviral agents are in use, such as HBV and HCV.",

Detailed genetic and biochemical analyses by A. Huang, J.J. Holland and their colleagues on the generation of VSV DI's and their interplay with the standard, infectious VSV contributed to unveil a continuous dynamics of genetic variation, competition, and selection, observable within short time intervals, a hallmark of RNA genetics (Palma and Huang, 1974; Holland et al., 1982) , fully confirmed by application of new sequencing techniques. DI particles and defective genomes are present in populations of positive-and negative-strand RNA viruses as they multiply in their natural hosts (N\u20ac uesch et al., 1989; Drolet et al., 1995; Li et al., 2011; Saira et al., 2013; Ke et al., 2013; Rezelj et al., 2018) . Their widespread presence in vivo may mean that they are an unavoidable side-product of the replication machineries (i.e., instruction to recombine) or that selection might have favored their generation. Both possibilities are compatible. An instruction whose result is a means to modulate replication of the corresponding standard viruses or the antiviral immune response will be selected as a consequence of its biological effects.",

            "text": "There is an ongoing controversy regarding clonality versus nonclonality in biological evolution, particularly concerning the evolution of cellular parasites (Heitman, 2010; Tibayrenc 2.12 Mutation, recombination, and reassortment as individual and combined evolutionary forces and Ayala, 2012, 2014; Ramirez and Llewellyn, 2014; Hauser and Cushion, 2018) . Clonality means asexual progeny from a single ancestor. In the case of viruses, clonal evolution emphasizes reproduction without the exchange of genetic material among two or more parental genomes. Sexual reproduction necessarily involves the exchange of genetic material. The question for viruses is interesting because we would be inclined to propose clonal evolution despite considerable promiscuity of recombination and reassortment. A tentative solution was offered based on one assumption and some experimental observations. The assumption is that recombination is not a requirement for viruses to complete their infection cycles. Despite the possibility that recombination might be imprinted in the replication apparatuses (rendering it inherent to replication), its occurrence is not a necessity. The experimental observations are of two sorts. One is that historically recombination and reassortment have been at the origin of the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens [western equine encephalitis virus, pandemic influenza viruses, emergent circulating poliovirus, HIV-1 and HCV recombinants, etc. (Section 2.12)]. The second observation is that recombination-based genome segmentation can occur given the adequate population dynamics and competitive environment, as documented with FMDV (Section 2.11). In consequence, the distinction was made between mechanistically unavoidable but biologically irrelevant, and meaningful recombination (Perales et al., 2015) . The latter form of recombination requires prior diversification of parental genomes by mutation and a number of cellular and epidemiological conditions. Despite its relevance to evolutionary transitions and viral emergence, it is not a requirement for virus survival, propagation, and evolution. This marks a contrast with the genomic exchanges associated with sexual reproduction. The proposal is that viruses evolve clonally at widely different time scales (intrahost or within-host evolution vs. long-term evolution at the epidemiological level). Similar arguments apply to mutation. This point will be addressed again in the closing Chapter 10, concerning implications of clonality.",

Absence of regulation is not incompatible with long-term evolution having shaped the molecular interactions that yield a level of mutagenesis compatible with survival and adaptability.

The same forces that drive general evolution have produced the dominant virus forms we see in nature, with all their nuances in the interaction with cell components. The adaptation of viruses to participate in intracellular processes with cells dictates that genetic variation of viruses has its limits to prevent deleteriousness. This is currently exemplified by the effects of amino acid substitutions in viral polymerases that either increase or decrease templatecopying fidelity.

Mutations are due mainly to changes in the electronic distributions of the standard nucleotides, to damage of nucleotides by external influences, and by alignment alterations of the template relative to product polynucleotide chains. The effect of a mutation can range from being well-tolerated to highly detrimental or lethal. \u2022 Mutation frequencies are only an indirect consequence of mutation rates. Their values for viruses whose replication is catalyzed by polymerases devoid of proofreading-repair activity are 10 5 -to 10 6 -fold higher than those displayed by replicative cellular DNA polymerases. Error-prone replication is a hallmark of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses. The larger the amount of genetic information encoded in a viral genome, the lower the mutation rate must be to maintain the genetic message. \u2022 Several mechanisms of genetic recombination have been described for DNA and RNA viruses. The best characterized is homologous recombination whose frequency of occurrence is dependent on the replicative machinery, in particular, polymerase processivity. Genome segment reassortment is operative in segmented genomes, and it gives rise to biologically relevant changes, such as an antigenic shift in the influenza type A viruses. \u2022 Studies with foot-and-mouth disease virus have shown that extensive evolution of an unsegmented RNA genome has the potential to undergo a recombination-mediated transition akin to genome segmentation. Therefore, segmented and unsegmented forms of RNA viruses need not be considered as completely unrelated classes of genome organization. \u2022 Recombination and genome segment reassortment have been viewed as conservative forces to rescue viable genomes from a damaged pool, and also as a means to explore new genomic compositions that deviate from their parents. All forms of genetic variation give rise to repertoires of variant genomes on which selection and random drift act to produce the viral forms that we isolate and study.",
