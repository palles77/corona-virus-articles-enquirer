It is estimated that in the United States alone, over 1,700,000 passengers board aircraft every day [3] . Beyond the hassles of an occasional late arrival or lost luggage, most travelers experience neither inconvenience nor adverse health consequence related to air travel. There are, however, some health risks to air travelers. Using real-life cases, concerns, and situations, this article discusses those risks and how savvy travelers can minimize air travel-associated health problems.",

Respiratory pathogens can spread by large droplets (which quickly fall down to the ground if they fail to reach the mucous membranes) or by tiny droplet nuclei (\\10 lm in diameter), which disperse widely and remain airborne for hours (measles, influenza, tuberculosis, and SARS spread by these droplet nuclei) [5, 6] . Close proximity onboard commercial aircrafts can help spread these infections to fellow passengers [2] . Approximately 26% of international travelers report respiratory illness associated with their travel [7] , but it is not known how much of this is caused by exposure on planes as opposed to during activities on the ground.",

Rapid global spread of SARS-corona virus in 2003 was facilitated by international travel as illustrated by initial dissemination of the SARS outbreak from Hong Kong [13] . Although concern of transmission to fellow passengers on aircraft was raised from early on, the first documented transmission of SARS-corona virus on airplane was reported in December of 2003 [10] . In their study, three flights that carried passengers with laboratoryconfirmed SARS-corona virus infection were investigated. There was strong evidence to suggest transmission of SARS-corona virus to 22 fellow passengers and crew members in one flight from Hong Kong to Beijing, which carried a symptomatic passenger. Travelers who became infected were sitting in the same row as the index case or within three rows directly in front of him (suggesting spread by aerosol and small droplets). None of the passengers in other sections of the plane acquired infection pointing against the possibility of transmission by the aircraft ventilation system. There was no evidence of transmission on flights that carried SARS-corona virus-infected passengers who were asymptomatic at the time of travel. These data suggest that the primary preventive strategy to minimize risk of in-flight transmission of SARS is to prevent symptomatic SARS patients from traveling [13] .",

Patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis may travel on commercial aircrafts without being aware of their diagnosis.

At this altitude, the partial pressure of inspired oxygen (PiO 2 ) drops from 150 mm Hg (sea level) to 109 mm Hg [20] . This fall in PiO 2 results in a drop of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ). In one study of healthy flight-crew members during 22 scheduled flights, mean nadir SaO 2 fell from 97% (preflight) to 88.6% at cruising altitude [21] . Most healthy travelers can compensate for this level of hypoxemia. Patients with pre-existing cardiac and respiratory conditions, however, who are hypoxemic at sea level, can develop respiratory distress with such a drop in SaO 2 at high altitude. Up to 10% of radio calls to ground medical staff for in-flight medical emergencies is related to respiratory problems [22] . To ensure a safe and comfortable flight for these patients, they should be evaluated for need of in-flight oxygen therapy. Recommended tests for this evaluation are summarized in Box 1. Travelers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the best studied group for flight-related problems. They are susceptible to significant in-flight hypoxemia depending on baseline PaO 2. Measurement of preflight forced expiratory volume in first second improves prediction of PaO 2 at altitude in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [26] . Most patients with interstitial lung disease (sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) generally well tolerate air travel. Travel guidelines for patients with specific respiratory conditions are summarized in Table 1 [1, 24, 27] .",

Individuals with acute myocardial infarction may need to delay their travel plan (Table 2 ) [2, 25] . Previously, a delay of several weeks was recommended for patients who suffered an acute myocardial infarction. In a review of 196 adults carried on commercial aircrafts post-myocardial infarction, however, 95% were transported without incident when traveling at least 2 weeks after the event [29] . A symptom-limited treadmill test at 10 to 14 days after myocardial infarction is a better way to assess fitness for flying than arbitrary travel restrictions [30] . Patients with an old myocardial infarction should not have any problem during air travel. Patients should be evaluated for need of in-flight oxygen. Unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia, Eisenmenger's syndrome, and severe symptomatic valvular heart disease are considered contraindications to travel by commercial air flights [1] . Postoperative patients are another group who may need to delay their travel plans after surgery. General anesthesia itself is not a contraindication for flying because cardiac depressant effects and changes in vascular systems secondary to anesthesia are rapidly reversible. Surgical procedures that result in entrapment of air in various body cavities (abdominal, chest, head, eye) can result in problems associated with expansion of gases at reduced cabin pressure at altitude (gases expand 25% at an altitude of 8000 ft). Recommended travel delay for specific surgical conditions is listed in Table 2 [1, 2, 29, [31] [32] [33] .",

Almost 1000 lives are lost annually from cardiac arrest in commercial aircrafts and airline terminals in International Airlines Transport Association carriers [37] . Most of the victims do not have prior history of heart disease. Ventricular fibrillation is the most common rhythm recorded in victims of sudden cardiac arrest [38, 39] . Early defibrillation is the most important predictor of success and long-term survival [40] . Chances of survival decrease by 10% for each minute defibrillation is delayed. Previously, the common practice of airlines was to continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation and divert the plane to the nearest airport. This may take 20 minutes or longer, however, even in best of circumstances. This is an unacceptable delay in view of current standards of care for sudden cardiac arrest [41] . A more logical approach is to place automated external defibrillators on board and train flight crew in their use [42] . Onboard automated external defibrillators improve chances of survival in cardiac arrest and avoid unnecessary and futile diversions for idioventricular rhythm and asystole [6, 43, 44] .",

Most travelers are at low risk and only need to follow nonpharmacologic measures listed in Box 2 [1, 2, 33, 51, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . Patients with additional risk factors should seek medical advice before traveling. Physicians may recommend delaying travel plans after orthopedic surgery or trauma to lower extremities. The role of pharmacologic measures (aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin) is controversial and their use should be limited to individuals at highest risk (malignancy, personal history of venous thromboembolism, recent major orthopedic surgery) [22, 65] . Single dose of low-molecular-weight heparin 2 to 4 hours before long-haul flights ([10 hours) was associated with a significant reduction in risk of traveler's thrombosis in a randomized case-control study of 300 subjects [51, 67] . Although aspirin prophylaxis has been shown to be helpful in reducing incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in high-risk medical and surgical patients, its role in reducing travel-related deep venous thrombosis has not yet been evaluated in prospective studies [68, 69] . Travelers should be cautioned against indiscriminate use of aspirin because of potential side effects of allergic reactions and gastrointestinal bleeding [2, 65] .",

Oxygen saturations were variable (85%-100%) but of lower mean (93%) in 15% oxygen as compared with 98% in room air. In low oxygen environments, irregular breathing (with respiratory pauses of less than 20 seconds) was more common.",

First, there is no proof that international travel causes sudden infant death syndrome, and any association noted is only anecdotal and likely coincidental at this point. Second, hypoxic environments similar to those of commercial aircraft do stimulate infants to have lower oxygen saturations and irregular breathing. The studied infants did not drop to dangerously low oxygen levels or have true apnea, and neither the decreased oxygenation nor the respiratory irregularity were associated with any sign of clinical compromise. There has been concern about prolonged air travel for infants, and there are physiologic changes associated with air travel-like environments, but there is no clear evidence of prolonged air travel being dangerous for infants.",

Scopolamine is also available in a patch form to be applied 6 to 8 hours before beginning a prolonged period of motion sickness risk (1.5 mg, gradual release over 72 hours). Transdermal scopolamine, however, is not approved in young children and carries a potential risk of adverse central nervous system effects including hallucinations and seizures.

Wear properly fitted graduated-compression stockings especially designed for air travel. Stockings are available over-the-counter and are reusable. Wear these correctly to avoid compression in popliteal area. Stockings are contraindicated in patients with peripheral arterial disease because these may provoke ischemia in this patient population. 3. Avoid constrictive clothing. 4. Take periodic walks during the flight. 5. Simple, frequent, isometric calf exercises, such as flexion and extension of foot and ankle rotation exercises. 6. Change positions periodically while seated. 7. Avoid leg crossing. 8. Maintain adequate hydration. 9. Avoid excess alcohol and caffeine-containing drinks because they may cause dehydration. 10. Do not place hand-luggage where it may restrict movement of legs and feet. 11. Get off plane and walk around in air terminal at refueling stops. Pharmacologic (may be considered for high-risk individuals) 1. Aspirin: caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease or history of gastrointestinal bleeding. 2. Low-molecular-weight heparin.
