However, ATF3 overexpression does not affect viral protein production, but rather promotes virus progeny release; 134 via interaction with a cis-regulatory site on the IFN-gamma gene, ATF3 reduces NK cell activity against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), with a resultant increase in viral pathology. Correspondingly, ATF3null mice show exhibit decreased hepatic viral load and reduced liver histopathology upon challenge with MCMV; 135 ATF3 is one of a small set of genes upregulated by adenovirus infection prior to commencement of viral gene expression; 136,137 ATF3 is required for the interferon-induced serine/threonine protein kinase (PKR) to induce apoptosis of virally infected cells; 138 ATF3 is also functionally important in mediating the pro-apoptotic effects of the proinflammatory p38 MAPK signaling pathway; 139 ATF3 production is stimulated by IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-alpha. Conflicting data suggest ATF3 may enhance or repress the development of a Th1 cytokine profile in CD+ T cells; 140,141 Blocking ATF3 reduces IL-6 production in response to TLR stimulation; 142 .ATF3 is induced by, and induces TGF-beta and is essential for activation of TGF-beta target genes; 143 ATF3 induces STAT1; 144 ATF3 enhances inflammatory responses to grafted islet cells promoting rejection; 145 ATF3 is required for mast cell maturation and function; 132 with heat shock transcription factor-1, ATF3 is necessary for ability of febrile temperatures to suppress IL-6 production; 146 ATF3acts as a transcriptional repressor of TLR4 signaling, 147 leading to transcriptional repression of TNF-alpha production in macrophages; 148 LPS-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases in human monocytes is suppressed by IFN-gamma via superinduction of ATF-3; 149 in a mouse model of human asthma, ATF3-deficiency significantly increases airway hyperresponsiveness, pulmonary eosinophilia, and enhances chemokine and Th2 cytokine responses in lung tissue and in lung-derived CD4(+) lymphocytes; 150 ATF is increased by COX-2 activity; 151",

These pathways enhance protection in internal organs, such as the nervous system, and in the barrier tissues--the mucosa and skin. Memory T cells that reside at these surfaces provide a first line of defense against subsequent infection, and defining the factors that regulate their development is critical to understanding organ-based immunity. 175 EIF3F eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit F EIF3F is a protein synthesis initiation factor that potently inhibits HIV-1 replication; 176,177 EIF3F is a component of the nuclear interactome of the HIV-1 encoded regulatory protein Tat, which is essential for HIV-1 replication and primarily orchestrates HIV-1 provirus transcriptional regulation; 5 EIF3F is required for initiation of HCV RNA translation in host cells and its induction is essential for the ability of iron to increase HCV expression; 178-181 In cells infected with poliovirus, cellular mRNA fails to bind to ribosomes, and synthesis of the majority of cellular proteins ceases, a pathological process dependent upon viral 2Apro cleavage of EIF3F; 182,183 EIF3F-induced deubiquitination essential for activation of Notch signaling pathway. 184 The Notch pathway has numerous effects relevant to inflammation/host-pathogen defense, 185 [204] [205] [206] [207] ITGB1 contributes to host defense against S. pneumonia by allowing leukocytes direct access to lung bronchioles early in the infectious process; 208 blockade of integrin beta-1 significantly reduces TNF-alpha production by monocytes, peritoneal and alveolar macrophages in response to heat-killed S. aureus; 209 integrin beta-1contributes to development of non-T cell-dependent extrafollicular antigen-specific splenic plasmablasts important for protection against intracellular bacteria such as l pathogens such as Ehrlichia muris; 210 human CMV infection may increase risk of cardiovascular disease by increasing endothelial cell proliferation, motility, and capillary tube formation in dependence upon binding to and signaling through the beta(1) and beta(3) integrins and the epidermal growth factor receptor, via their ability to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways; 211 human CMV ability to activate IFN-alpha signaling is partially dependent on viral interactions with integrin beta-1, whereas HCMV induced proinflammatory cytokine production is TLR2, but not ITGB1-dependent; 211 binding interactions of bacteria intimin with epithelial integrin beta-1 are essential for infection of human colonic epithelium by Shiga toxin-producing Enterohemorrhagic E. coli; 212 anopheline antiplatelet protein (AAPP) isolated from the saliva of Anopheles stephensi, a human malaria vector mosquito, exhibites a strong and specific inhibitory activity toward collagen-induced platelet aggregation (allowing blood feeding to proceed effectively) that depends in part upon integrin beta-1; 213 integrin beta-1 required for long-term retention of memory CD4+ T cells in bone marrow following L. monocytogenes infection, although integrin beta-1 is not required for maintenance of long-term pathogenspecific memory CD+ T cells; 214 stimulation of the TLR4 by LPS activates PI3K/AKT signaling and promotes downstream beta-1 integrin function, which has been implicated in increased cancer cell adhesiveness and metastatic potential; 215 GRM8 glutamate receptor, metabotropic 8 GRM8 (a type III mGlu) has been identified as a vulnerability gene for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's) in more than one population sample, 216 suggesting a link between GRM8 and inflammatory functioning; GRM8 activation reduces hyperalgesia in response to inflammatory stimulation in animal models; 217 in response to inflammatory signaling, polymorphonuclear leukocytes release glutamate that decreases human brain endothelial barrier function via reductions in phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, 218 suggesting that type III mGlu signaling is involved in PMN migration in response to infection; type III mGlu stimulation mediates the excitotoxic effects of the proinflammatory mediators homocysteine and homocysteic acid; 219 type III mGlu stimulation blocks TLR4-activated microglia inhibition of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (which is driven by microglia TNFalpha/IL-6 production); 220",

Am J Psychiatry 2010; 167: alpha binds and interacts with the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein, which play key functions at almost all stages of the viral life cycle. This interaction impairs in vitro viral RNA, a result consistent with a previously proposed model in which inhibition of translation by the accumulation of Gag serves to enhance viral spread by releasing viral RNA from polysomes, permitting the RNA to be packaged into nascent virions; 117 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pathogenicity arises in part from the interaction off the viral C terminus (amino acids 251 to 422) of the N protein with human EF1-alpha which induces aggregation of EF1alpha, inhibiting protein translation and cytokinesis by blocking F-actin bundling; 118 EF1-alpha contributes to apoptosis during viral infection, and in response to LPS and IL-1-beta, via interaction with interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats-1(IFIT1), which is rapidly synthesized in response to viral infection, functions as an inhibitor of translation by binding to the eukaryotic initiation factor-3, and consequently enhances resistance activity against viral invasion to cells; 119 TNF-alpha down-regulates gene expression of EF1-alpha in endothelial cells; 120 VCAN versican In context of cervical cancer, versican reduces number of infiltrating CD8+ T cells; 121 versican important for hyaluronan-dependent binding of moncytes to the extracellular matrix of lunch fibroblasts stimulated by the viral mimetic agent, polyinosine-polycytidylic acid. These findings implicate versican in ability of viral infections to exacerbate asthma and other lung disorders; 122 Stimulation of mononuclear cells with GM-CSF increases the expression of versican mRNA as well as cytokine induction in these cells; 123NLGN1neuroligin 1 NLGN1 reported to modulate immune functioning in CNS following trauma via interactions with ERK1/2 and neurexin-",
