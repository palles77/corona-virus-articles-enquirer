Existing methods used to block translation lack the spatiotemporal precision to investigate cell-49 specific contributions to consolidation of long-term memories. Here, we have developed a novel chemogenetic 50 mouse resource for cell type-specific and drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition (ciPSI) that utilizes an 51 engineered version of the catalytic kinase domain of dsRNA-activated protein (PKR). ciPSI allows rapid and 52 reversible phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 causing a block on general translation by 50% in vivo. Using this resource, 53 we discovered that temporally structured pan-neuronal protein synthesis is required for consolidation of long-54 term auditory threat memory. Targeted protein synthesis inhibition in CamK2\u03b1 expressing glutamatergic 55 neurons in lateral amygdala (LA) impaired long-term memory, which was recovered with artificial chemogenetic 56 reactivation at the cost of stimulus generalization. Conversely, genetically reducing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in 57 CamK2\u03b1 positive neurons in LA enhanced memory strength, but was accompanied with reduced memory 58 fidelity and behavior inflexibility. Our findings provide evidence for a finely tuned translation program during 59 consolidation of long-term threat memories.",

Aversive life-threatening events often lead to long-84 term associative memories between the environment in which those events were experienced in and the 85 threat, such that a salient cue from the event when presented again can elicit species-specific defensive 86 behaviors. Pavlovian cued threat conditioning is a useful experimental paradigm for understanding the 87 biological substrates of an associative threat memory, in which a neutral cue (e.g. light or tone) co-presented 88 with an innately aversive stimulus (e.g. air puff or footshock) elicits a defensive response such as freezing by a 89 repeat presentation by itself 1 . Cued threat conditioning is particularly amenable to studying memory 90 consolidation process because one-trial training is sufficient to form a persistent long-term memory and a 91 unimodal cue can be used for memory retrieval. Long-term aversive memories are thought to recruit a 92 distributed network of neurons across the brain, including subnuclei within amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, 93 as well as the neocortex, depending on the brain state, cue complexity, and the sensory pathways engaged 2, 3 .",

For instance, an extensively 100 used PSI, anisomycin, causes unwanted side effects that include superinduction of immediate early genes, 101 activation of stress signaling pathways, and catecholamine release 11, 12 . Pharmacological PSIs also do not 102 discriminate between molecularly heterogeneous cell populations and thus, do not allow manipulation of cell 103 autonomous protein synthesis. Genetic approaches to alter the translation machinery at the initiation step 104 provide less ambiguous evidence for the role of protein synthesis in memory processes 13, 14 .

Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 stops the recycling of the ternary 114 complex and inhibits general translation 16 . However, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 also leads to a paradoxical 115 increase in gene-specific translation of transcripts harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) by 116 overcoming the inhibitory effects of uORFs on reinitiation at the putative start codon as ternary complexes 117 decline 17 .

We virally delivered CamK2\u03b1.Cre.EGFP into the bilateral LA of iPKR mice 234 and control mice (Fig. 4a) . Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 was increased specifically in CamK2\u03b1.iPKR neurons 235 compared to wild-type mice and non-EGFP positive neurons in the same animals ( Fig. 4b) with a 236 corresponding decrease in de novo translation (Fig. 4c ) upon ASV administration.

It is possible that because 358 these investigators injected the drug inducer of fPKR (AP20187) 2h before radioisotope S35 methionine 359 injection i.p., the sensitive time window for protein synthesis disruption was missed during labeling. Compared 360 to fPKR, PKR kinase domain (PKRk) is more effective in suppressing translation because it not only directly 361 phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, but it also interacts with and phosphorylates endogenous full-length PKR, further 362 boosting eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation 48 . In our system, central infusion of ASV resulted in 2-fold increase in 363 phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, which resulted in a robust 50% decrease of general translation as assessed with in vivo 364 SUnSET that involved local infusion of puromycin directly into lateral amygdala. Our convergent data from a365 parallel strategy of cell autonomous protein synthesis inhibition in LA CamK2\u03b1+ neurons using a synthetic 366 micro-RNA against eIF4E provides further support for the requirement of de novo protein synthesis in long-367 term memory consolidation. Nonetheless, we also observed an increase in ATF4 levels following 368 phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and cannot exclude the possibility that the memory deficit in the iPKR transgenic 369 mice is in part due to upregulated translation of transcripts containing uORFs, such as ATF4 and the ensuing 370 repression of CREB-regulated genes. 371 372 Memory generalization and behavioral inflexibility as a result of dysregulated translation 373 Several studies have used IEG-based engram cell targeting approaches to interrogate the nature of 374 memory formation and recall. Artificial reactivation of conditioned threat engram cells in LA using optogenetics 375 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a generalization. We propose that learning-induced somatic and synaptic protein synthesis functions to stabilize 381 the connections between the pathway-specific afferents from conditioned tone processing brain regions 382 (auditory cortex and auditory thalamus) to amygdalar engram cells in such a way that the conditioned tone can 383 access and activate the downstream neuronal network in the LA during recall. This natural cue-elicited 384 neuronal reactivation is incompletely recapitulated by artificial reactivation of LA neurons, such that there is 385 imprecise restoration of the memory, perhaps due to a lack of reinstatement of synapse specificity of the 386 original memory trace. Phospho-mutant eIF2\u03b1 mice, with a rigid increase in translation in LA principal neurons, 387 also exhibit stimulus generalization and behavioral inflexibility at tone offset. Taken together, our data indicate 388 that a finely tuned translation program in the amygdala is required to coordinate the stability and precision of 389 the long-term memory trace. 390 391 Model of protein synthesis regulation during long-term memory consolidation 392 Based on our data, we propose the following cellular/molecular model of protein synthesis regulation in 393 lateral amygdala during long-term consolidation. Cued threat conditioning leads to a coordinated increase in 394 protein synthesis in CamK2\u03b1+ neurons in the soma and in local subcellular compartments, such as dendritic 395 spines and axons. This results in robust memory strength and precision (Fig. 7a). Chemogenetic inhibition of 396 protein synthesis using iPKR blocks general translation in LA CamK2\u03b1+ neurons resulting in memory loss (Fig. 397 7b). Expression of biallelic phosphomutant eIF2\u03b1 in LA CamK2\u03b1+ neurons, although insensitive to iPKR-398 mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, results in an aberrant increase in basal translation. This leads to robust399 memory strength, but low memory precision.(Fig. 7c). Artificial chemogenetic reactivation of CamK2\u03b1+ 400 neurons following inhibition of protein synthesis leads to an increase in protein synthesis, but does not 401 recapitulate learning-induced local translation, thus causing memory generalization. This is manifested as 402 normalized memory strength and low memory precision(Fig. 7d).",
