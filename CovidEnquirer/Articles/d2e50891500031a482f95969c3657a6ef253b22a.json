Specific sociodemographic groups of persons were more likely to be less informed and more worried about contracting the diseases. P ublic reaction to emerging infectious diseases is a critical factor in controlling the diseases. Informed behavior change may be needed to control disease transmission. Negative public reactions, such as stigmatizing persons at risk for the disease, may greatly hamper prevention and treatment efforts (1, 2) . The current public health strategy to control emerging infectious diseases includes timely and complete public reporting (3) . Providing timely and complete information, however, cannot determine public reaction to the information.",

AIDS may be considered the prototype of an emerging infectious disease. While AIDS has received considerable public attention since the early 1980s, the strong emotions associated with it create the possibility of nonrational information processing. The stigmatization of persons with or at risk for AIDS has persisted despite public information about the disease (4). In contrast, SARS emerged quite abruptly in 2002-2003 and received intense public media attention, but the disease was declared contained by the World Health Organization in 2003 (5); little public media attention has been paid to SARS since then.",

In this analysis, we compared characteristics of respondents who reported knowing \"nothing\" or \"not much\" and \"some\" or \"a lot\" about the diseases. We considered respondents who reported knowing \"nothing\" or \"not much\" to be poorly informed. Five percent of the respondents reported being poorly informed about AIDS, and 21% reported being poorly informed about SARS. Table 2 presents the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents and shows their relationship to worry about contracting AIDS or SARS. In this analysis, we examined characteristics of respondents who reported that they were \"very worried\" about contracting AIDS or SARS. There were no meaningful difference in the percentage of subjects who reported being \"very informed\" about each disease or \"very worried\" about contracting each disease.",
