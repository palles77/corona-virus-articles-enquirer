Yet the report's language is far from a call to arms. Its buzzword slogans about \"more research for better health\" trade in mood rather than critical thinking. Colourful but indistinct, the use of \"mood\" is a way of engineering consent, of selling ideas; a method of getting the audience to feel rather than understand. Furthermore, \"mood\" is powerfully addictive; those who trade in the word find it irresistible that you never need to define what you mean. We believe that making health policy and systems more evidence-based requires more than mood.",

We learned how Hong Kong used the police department's information system to control severe acute respiratory syndrome, how the Tanzania Essential Health Intervention Project influenced resource allocation at district level, how WHO's Health InterNetwork Access to Research Information initiative bridges the digital divide, how the Meningitis Vaccine Project aims to transfer technology to developing countries, and much more. Casestudy boxes are normally used to fill space. In this report, they are apposite and fascinating, bringing application of health research to life. Unfortunately, the report does not offer a convincing discussion on how these practical examples of links between research and health-systems develop-ment could be scaled up. The question remains: what happened to the charcoal?",

Over 25 years ago, the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma Ata recommended that \"single-purpose programmes should be integrated into primary health care activities as quickly and smoothly as possible.\" 3 This did not happen, of course, and the discussion of vertical versus horizontal programming has never stopped. 10 years ago, the World Bank published a ground-breaking but under-promoted book entitled Better health in Africa. 4 Couched in diplomatic language, the book summarised the significant shortcomings of vertical immunisation, nutrition, and diarrhoea-control programmes in several African countries.",

It is now a \"major priority [to conduct] research on how to better integrate single-disease programmes within the broader health system\" (p 54). The chutzpah of this recommendation is astonishing. Why should we burden researchers in developing countries with finding ways to integrate vertical programmes, when we have 25 years of documented evidence about the devastating effect of these programmes on national health systems? No level of evidence appears to have cured the addiction of international agencies to silver bullets-just keep bringing the charcoal.",

In an effort to explain the origin of the association between transfusion and mortality, van de Watering and colleagues did two subsequent randomised trials, 3, 4 in which they investigated the hypothesis that allogeneic blood transfusions containing white cells could predispose patients to multiple-organ failure, which might in turn increase mortality. However, they could not show such an association in either trial. All previous studies of these adverse effects of allogeneic transfusion noted the effects of transfusion of red blood cells, and raised the possibility that transfusion of other blood components might have similar effects. Recently, Bruce Spiess and colleagues 5 focused on the effects of platelet transfusion in a re-analysis of patients who had coronary-artery-bypass grafting. The researchers reanalysed data from six randomised trials, done between 1990 and 1995, in which patients were allocated randomly to receive aprotinin or control. These trials were not designed to investigate the adverse effects of platelet transfusion, and the enrolled patients were not allocated randomly to receive platelet transfusion or control. In the re-analysis, the investigators found an association between platelet transfusion and adverse outcomes that included postoperative infection, stroke, and death. The frequency of such adverse outcomes was calculated for patients who had received platelets and for those who had not. Patients receiving (and, to a lesser extent, patients not receiving) platelets had often received red blood cells or plasma, or both, as well.",

For example, platelet recipients had longer hospital stays, longer operating time, more bleeding, and more frequent re-operation for bleeding. The investigators used multivariate statistical analysis to control for the effects of confounding factors associated with both platelet transfusion and the targeted outcomes. They acknowledged, however, that no observational study can completely adjust for the effects of all confounders, because not all confounders of a particular association are known or can be measured. 1 Spiess and co-workers' ability to adjust for the effects of confounders was further compromised because they could only enter variables into statistical models if data for those variables had been collected in previous randomised trials. Finally, they built their statistical models by the stepwise method, which does not ensure adjustment for the effects of all measured confounders. 1 For these reasons, Spiess and colleagues 5 appropriately concluded that platelet transfusion might have been a surrogate marker for illness severity. Alternatively, platelet transfusion could cause the adverse outcomes, and this *Josef Decosas, Simon Heap",
