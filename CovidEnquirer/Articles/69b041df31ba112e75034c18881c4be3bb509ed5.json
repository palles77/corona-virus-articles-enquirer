In our recent studies, MT-4/17-3-6, a strain of HIV-1, showed the strong resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors compared with other strains such as MT-4/LAI, L-2 and CU98-26, and had a distinctive L 565 M mutation in the central region of NHR. To investigate the relationship between the mutation and resistance, we performed a molecular modeling of the coiled-coil of MT-4/17-3-6 by using energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation based on the MT-4/LAI X-ray structure. As a result, we found that H 564 in the NHR was pushed to the outer side by this mutation, and three hydrogen bond bridges of Y 638 -H 564 -E 560 -Q 650 could be formed, enclosing the coiled-coil. The binding of peptide inhibitors would be disturbed by the structural stabilization of these bridges in MT-4/17-3-6.",

Studies by electron microscopy [2] [3] [4] demonstrated that the spike protein of HIV-1 formed a trimer complex in fusion process. In addition, molecular structure analyses [5] [6] [7] revealed that NHR and CHR had similar helical conformations packed in an anti-parallel manner, and that the three pairs of NHR and CHR in a trimer gp41 were arranged tightly in a trimeric coiled-coil. Three NHR regions were coiled in the inner side and the three CHR regions covered the NHR coil on the outer side. This coiled-coil complex could be constructed by conformational changes of glycoprotein 120 interacting with CD4 and CXCR4 coreceptor [8, 9] . Formation of the coiled-coil causes the viral envelope to approach the target cell membrane via tight binding, and allows membrane fusion associated with rapid entry of the viron core into the target cell [1, 10, 11] . Thus, the NHR-CHR interactions are very important for investigating the fusion mechanism of the virus entry process and for designing the inhibitors against the cell fusion.",

            "text": "A possible structure of the MT-4/17-3-6 NHR-CHR complex predicted from energy minimization is shown in Fig. 1A . We found three sets of hydrogen bond bridges which seemed to fix the complex effectively. The bridge consisted of three hydrogen bonds of Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 , H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 and E 560 O d2 -Q 650 N e2 , and three of the bridges enclosed the complex on its surface. The alignment of functional groups in the bridge was seemed to be similar to the charge relay system of serine protease active sites. In the structure of the MT-4/LAI NHR-CHR complex, shown in Fig. 1B , only E 560 O d2 -Q 650 N e2 was formed and Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 and H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 were not formed. Especially, the phenyl ring of Y 638 and the imidazole ring of H 564 existed side by side, but O g and N d1 or N e2 were not placed where they could form a hydrogen bond. The sidechain of H 564 in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex shifted slightly to the outer side of the complex compared with the MT-4/LAI complex, and it was thought that the formation of hydrogen bonds of Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 and H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 was enable by this shift. The total interaction energy between NHR and CHR was \u00c04.52 \u00b7 10 2 kcal/mol in MT-4/17-3-6 and \u00c04.05 \u00b7 10 2 kcal/mol in MT-4/LAI; thus, the NHR and CHR of MT-4/17-3-6 were combined more strongly than these of MT-4/LAI. The statistical analyses of the formation of these hydrogen bonds during the later iterations of the molecular dynamics simulations are summarized in Table 2 , and a superimposed stereo view of the most stable structure in the simulations is shown in Fig. 2 . In the MT-4/ 17-3-6 complex, hydrogen bonds were formed in the conformation with probabilities of 82.3% and 59.7% for Y 638 O g -H 564 N d1 and H 564 N e2 -E 560 O d1 respectively, which are very high probabilities compared with these for MT-4/LAI. Just beside H 564 , the L 565 M mutation was found in MT-4/17-3-6 compared with MT-4/LAI. In the MT-4/LAI complex, as shown by dark blue and green sticks in Fig. 2 , the L 565 sidechain contacted CHR sidechains of I 635 and I 642 by hydrophobic interaction, and this interaction was fixed tightly by the existence of a hydrogen bond between Q 567 and T 639 . On the other hand, in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex, as shown by orange and yellow sticks, a longer hydrophobic sidechain of M 565 existed instead of the shorter sidechain of leucine. Two isoleucines, glutamine and threonine in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex remained at the same positions in the MT-4/LAI complex and fixed the sidechain of methionine. In addition, the I 635 residue, especially its sidechain, was close to the sidechain of M 565 because of loss of the branched structure in the sidechain L 565 .",

As shown in detail in Fig. 2 , the structural difference from the MT-4/LAI complex in this region was that the M 565 mainchain and the H 564 of NHR were pushed to the outer side (from dark blue to orange) and the neighboring Y 638 and T 639 of CHR were shifted to the opposite direction (from green to yellow). As a result, the imidazole ring of H 564 in the MT-4/17-3-6 complex was placed in the position and direction where it could be stabilized by hydrogen bonds with both Y 638 in the CHR region and E 560 in the same NHR region.",

As shown in Table 1, E 630 Q, S 641 G, and N 651 I mutations were found distinctively in the CHR region of MT-4/17-3-6, but all of these residues were placed on the outer side, which had no direct interaction with the inner NHR coils. S 641 G and N 651 I were adjacent to Y 638 and Q 650 . It seemed that these mutations might contribute to the formation of hydrogen bond bridges by increasing the flexibilities of the neighboring mainchain of Y 638 and decreasing the hydrogen bonding to the Q 650 sidechain via water molecules, respectively. Therefore, it was thought that the L 565 M mutation would be a major factor affecting the coiled-coil stabilization by these bridges, and the binding of peptide fusion inhibitors might be distinctively disturbed by this stabilization in MT-4/17-3-6. The parallel stacking of two rings of H 564 and Y 638 was also found in the X-ray structure [7] , but no hydrogen bond between these sidechains was shown in the structure, because the two rings were placed too closely, as was also true in the MT-4/LAI model. We think that the hydrogen bond between H 564 and Y 638 fixes the sidechain of H 564 in the position that makes it easy to form the next hydrogen bond with E 560 , and that the positional relationship of the two rings is very important for the total formation of the hydrogen bond bridges shown in the model for MT-4/17-3-6.",

            "text": "Coiled-coil trimeric structures are commonly found in the spike proteins of not only HIV but also other corona viruses, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, and SARS virus [28] . In these coiled-coil structures, it seemed that HIV had the most tightly combined complex of NHR and CHR, and therefore the mode of interaction between NHR and CHR of HIV may be most effective for the trimeric formation at the time of virus attack. We found in our previous research that the differences of gp41 resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors were larger for intra-subtype comparisons, such as MT-4/LAI and MT-4/17-3-6, than for inter-subtype comparisons, such as MT-4/LAI and CU98-26 (subtypes are shown in Table 1 ) [23] . These large intra-subtype differences can be explained by our model, which showed that the L 565 M mutation could stabilize the coiled-coil without affecting the structure of the protein widely. We previously reported that the resistance to peptide fusion inhibitors differed markedly between MT-4/LAI and L-2 in spite of the fact that they had the same sequences of NHR and CHR (Table 1) . It is not thought that all of the differences between these virus strains could be explained in here clearly, because the interactions between the NHR-CHR complex and the other regions of the spike protein were not considered in our analyses. However, by the focusing on the L 565 M mutation in the inner and central moiety, which would be not affected by the other regions, we found that this mutation might be an important factor for the resistance of MT-4/17-3-6 to peptide inhibitors with respect to coiled-coil formation and cell fusion. shown by orange and yellow sticks, and these of MT-4/LAI by dark blue and green sticks, respectively. Oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are colored by red, light blue, and white.
