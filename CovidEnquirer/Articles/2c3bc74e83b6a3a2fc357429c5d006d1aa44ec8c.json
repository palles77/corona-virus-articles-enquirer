The emergence of a new disease that spreads easily between people and jumps from region to region has an objective narrative, but each of us experiences our own private outbreak. Many people working in public health and clinical medicine know where they were when the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic became real to them. I was in the Emergency Operations Center of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",

By late April, I had already done press briefings and several individual interviews, where I shared what little information we had at the time, and tried to place that in context. One evening, after successfully finishing what was expected to be a very difficult live television interview, I was feeling much relief and delight. I returned to our crowded emergency operations center to reconnect with my colleagues. I found them huddled around a speaker phone, looking ashen. They had just conferred with a state's public health officials about a pregnant woman who was critically ill with what was likely to be the new virus. She was not expected to make it. The 2009 H1N1 virus was not a practice exercise. Real people were going to get very ill and people who were not supposed to die that year were going toeven if we all did everything we could, even if all the parts of the public health and health care delivery systems rose to the occasion, and even if we had much good fortune. That is what a new influenza virus does. At this point, we could not say how large the problem would get or how many lives were threatened. But we knew that for this woman, and her family and caregivers, the reality was overwhelming.",

Greatest development of modern life? The ice cube. Memories about prohibition? The town tippler asleep on the doorstep of the family's general store, after overdoing it with a case of lemon extract.

A few years earlier, my grandparents had been living in Baltimore, MD, and things had been different for my grandmother's first delivery. She described being in the hospital when a nurse told her \"Don't worry, we won't let what happened to your sister happen to you.\" My grandmother had not been told yet, but her beloved sister Bessie, who lived in another state down south, had recently died during childbirth. There had been some sort of collusion to keep that information from her, but the nurse had not been in on the full plan. My grandmother said on hearing the nurse's words, she immediately realized what must have happened, and she fainted. When she came to, her own healthy baby girl was there. They named their daughter Betsy, in memory of the aunt she would never meet. And Grandma said for each of her next 3 deliveries, she just passed out-reliving the shock she had experienced at learning of her sister's death, and miraculously being spared the pains of childbirth.",

They fed me regularly and provided a sounding board as I recounted the dramas of internship and residency-stories of the torrent of terribly ill people whose care was being entrusted to me.

I got news of her passing a few days later, and was unable to get to her funeral or grieve together with our family. Instead, I was immersed in the public health emergency in China, where the SARS pandemic was centered. My public health counterparts in Beijing had the difficult task of triaging the scarce intensive care unit beds spread across the city. They had convened each evening to sort out who was about to die, how many more beds would thus open up, and which patients would get them. There were doctors, nurses, and medical professors in some of those intensive care unit beds. My counterparts had to manage the epidemic while some of their longtime colleagues and friends were dying from it. The Chinese professionals rose to the occasion-the government built a new 1000-bed facility in record time-but you knew that this pandemic was personal for them.",

They organized the gathering of new knowledge, such as the articles that appear in this special issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
