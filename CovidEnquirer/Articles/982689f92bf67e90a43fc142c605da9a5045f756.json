We collected the detailed dates of COVID-19 cases reported on the websites of the National Health Commissions of China and Provincial Health Commissions of China. The death time was calculated on the basis of the diagnosis dates and death dates of 134 dead patients. The mean death time of COVID-19 was 9.2\u00b16.7 days, the median death time was 8 days, and the quartile spacing was 9.2 days. According to the diagnosis dates, and discharge dates of 536 cured cases with COVID-19, the cure time from diagnosis dates to discharge dates was calculated. The cure time curve of the patients displayed a left skewed distribution with a skewness of 0.85. The mean cure time was 13.6\u00b15.6 days, the median cure time of was 12 days, and a 95% confidence interval was from 7.4 to 21.7 (figure 5).",

Huang CL et al reported clinical features of 41 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China. As of Jan 22, 2020, 28 of 41 patients had been discharged and 6 patients (the mortality 15%) died. 11 Wang D et al reported clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirusinfected pneumonia in Wuhan, China. 12 47 patients were discharged and 6 died (4.3%). The remaining 85 patients were still hospitalized. The mortality was reported as 4.3%. Zhang YP extracted a total of 72314 cases with COVID-19 reported China' Infectious Disease information System through Feb.11, 2020. 13 Thereof a total of 1023 deaths occurred among 44672 confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. However, he ignored a fact that there were 4740 discharged cases and 38909 hospitalized cases in confirmed cases. At present, in official websites the case fatality rates were calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. These data are neither case fatality rate, nor mortality, and might be off by orders of magnitude. 8 The confirmed cases included deaths, cured, and hospitalized patients. Some of the hospitalized patients may end up dead in future and their data would not participate in the calculation of the case fatality. In addition, diagnosis of viral infection will precede death or recovery by days to weeks. The number of deaths should be compared to the past confirmed case numbersaccounting for this delay increasing the estimate of the case fatality rate.",
