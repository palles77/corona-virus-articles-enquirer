A nosocomial infection in a premature newborn child could become very serious. 4, 5 Human bocavirus (HBoV), was firstly detected in 2005 from samples obtained in Swedish children and infants with lower respiratory tract infection. 6 Soon after, new series were published around the world describing different incidence of infection by HBoV. 7e13 In the majority of these series, HBoV is found as a frequent virus in patients between 6 months and 4 years of age with upper or lower respiratory tract infection.",

The patient developed chronic pulmonary disease, requiring continuous oxygen therapy and several cycles of systemic corticoids. At day 107, her respiratory condition worsened, and it was necessary to start again with mechanical ventilation due to an increase in respiratory difficulty, a requirement for 100% oxygen, and the presence of radiological infiltrates. Disseminated wheezing and rales were detected. Fever was not present. Nosocomial sepsis was suspected, and the patient was treated with wide spectrum i.v. antibiotic therapy, although blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine samples proved to be negative. Inhaled bronchodilator and Pulmozyme (dornase alpha) were administered. A sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and HBoV was the only respiratory virus detected.

Weissbrich et al. 10 also assumed nosocomial infection by HBoV, since they presented three patients who developed respiratory symptoms during their stay at the hospital after admission for other reasons. Finally, Kesebir et al. 8 published a set of patients who, similar to ours, were hospitalised since birth after developing respiratory pathology. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 months, and in all these cases there was a clear nosocomial transmission of HBoV.",

In general, during this period of life it is very difficult to identify any infection, especially in the case of new infectious agents, if a specific investigation is not carried out. In our hospital we are performing a prospective study of respiratory infections in hospitalised children for more than 10 years, and this may be helpful in assigning an etiologic role and define a viral infection in our both individual patients. However, these two patients did not show any specific clinical symptoms of infection by HBoV or any analytical data that could set them apart from other pre-term newborns with respiratory complications. The first patient required increased oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation and had a radiological image compatible with atelectasis. The second patient had symptoms of a worsening basal condition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia that was later diagnosed as a nosocomial infection. The respiratory pathology in this second patient was increasing in severity over time, ultimately causing her death. To determine the extent to which infection by HBoV played a role in the clinical outcome of these two children is not possible, although the absence of other microrganisms supports the possible association of HBoV presence with illness. On the other hand, could be considered the possibility that these infants may have acquired the virus from their mothers, either before or during the delivery process. Since it is not known any data considering the maternalefetal transmission of the HBoV, this possibility could not be ruled out.",

We have also conducted a study in healthy children, aiming to get a better knowledge of the prevalence of HBoV by isolation in nasopharyngeal aspirate. The prevalence in this study, not associated to pathology, is bellow 5% of the studied population. 16 HBoV might cause banal infections in adults, which could be the origin of the nosocomial infection, as has already been demonstrated for other virus such as coronavirus. 3 Unfortunately, we did not get samples from the mothers or other personal in the intensive care unit which, if positive, could explain the origin of the infection. We do not have urine, stool or CSF samples of the babies. Nevertheles, our group, Pozo et al. 13 as well as other authors as Vicente et al. 17 have published patients with positive urine and stool samples and that could be explained by a systemic infection.",
