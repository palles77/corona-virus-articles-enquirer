            "text": "Despite their relatively low frequency (0.2-0.8%) in the general PBMC population, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) represent an important component of the innate immune system (Liu, 2005; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al., 2008) . Within a few hours after encountering a pathogen, individual cells can release type I IFN in the range of 3-10 pg-a quantity that is 100-1000-fold more than the amount produced by any other type of blood cell (Siegal et al., 1999) . This prodigious response is partly due to their rather unique expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 9 that interact with single-stranded RNA molecules with a high percentage of guanosine or uridine residues or singlestranded DNA strands having unmethylated CpG motifs, respectively (Gilliet et al., 2008) . Foreign entities such as viruses are endocytosed into pDC endosomes where engagement of ligands in their genomes with the appropriate TLR triggers a MyD88-dependent pathway leading to ubiquitination and phosphorylation of interferon Plausible representatives of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in pigs have been characterized as being CD4 hi CD172 lo . Due to their paucity in blood, we utilized novel fluorescent-activated cell sorting procedures to isolate them from PBMC. The resultant subset was greater than 98% homogeneous in regards to the selected phenotype and contained the preponderance of individuals secreting IFN-a after exposure to a known stimulant, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In addition to being a potent source of IFN-a, other properties of these porcine CD4 hi CD172 lo cells including their morphological transition from a plasma cell-like shape during quiescence to one resembling a dendritic cell (DC) after activation by TGEV and their relatively strong constitutive expression of interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) conformed to the expectations of genuine pDCs. While a substantial IFN-a response was also elicited from the porcine pDCs by pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV), and TLR7 and 9 agonists, there was an agent-dependent induction of varying amounts of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-g, and TNF-a. Notably, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) failed to provoke the pDCs to secrete any of the measured cytokines except IL-2. Moreover, whereas pDCs exposed to TGEV or the TLR9 agonist rapidly increased IRF-7 production and morphed into DCs with enhanced CD80/86 expression, similar alterations were not observed during incubation with PRRSV. This atypical response of pDCs to PRRSV may contribute to its pathogenesis, which unlike that associated with PrV, SIV or TGEV includes persistent infection and limited development of protective immunity.",

            "text": "regulatory factor (IRF)-7. The modified IRF-7 then translocates to the nucleus where it is involved in autocrine regulation of gene expression and transcription of the IFN genes (Kawai et al., 2004; Honda et al., 2005) . Although other cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6 are also produced by stimulated pDCs (Liu, 2005) , their rapid secretion of copious amounts of type I IFNs such as IFN-a (Cella et al., 1999; Siegal et al., 1999) helps establish an antiviral state (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007) . Moreover, activated pDCs influence the development of adaptive immunity by inducing the differentiation of B cells (Jego et al., 2003; Poeck et al., 2004) and effector T cells and also by promoting the generation of regulatory T cells (Cella et al., 2000; McKenna et al., 2005; Ito et al., 2007) . Phenotypically, human pDCs have been characterized as being CD4 + but lacking lineage markers common to B (CD19, B cell receptor), myeloid (CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD14, CD33), NK (CD16, CD56), and T (CD3, gd T cell receptor) cells (Perussia et al., 1985; Cella et al., 1999; Liu, 2005) . Quiescent pDCs constitutively express IRF-7 and the immediate availability of this factor is essential for their ability to promptly react to the presence of viruses (Coccia et al., 2004; Dai et al., 2004) . Upon activation, pDCs undergo a morphological transition from their hallmark plasmacytoid shape into a form associated with mature dendritic cells (DCs) (Grouard et al., 1997; Soumelis and Liu, 2006) . Moreover, their expression of MHC class II proteins as well as the co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86, is increased (Perussia et al., 1985; Svensson et al., 1996; Cella et al., 2000; Bauer et al., 2001) .",

Their low frequency in the blood (maximum of 40-110 cells per 10 5 PBMC) was shown to vary and be influenced by the pig's age, genetics, and physiological status . Moreover, they were found to migrate into the lymphoid tissue of virus-infected animals (Riffault et al., 1997 (Riffault et al., , 2001 . TGEV-responsive NIPCs were later defined as being in the CD1 \u00c0 CD4 + CD14 \u00c0 CD172 lo subset of PBMC based on magnetic separation or flow cytometric analyses of mAb-treated blood mononuclear cells (Summerfield et al., 2003) . A similar phenotype was also noted for those PBMC activated by certain oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG motifs to produce IFN-a (Domeika et al., 2004; Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004) . In addition to TGEV and some ODNs, porcine NIPCs can be stimulated by classic swine fever virus (Balmelli et al., 2005) , foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) complexed with FMDV-specific Igs (Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2006) , pseudorabies virus (PrV) (Domeika et al., 2004) , and swine influenza virus (SIV) (Summerfield and McCullough, 2009) .",

This protocol was later improved by using anti-CD3, anti-CD8 and anti-CD45RA mAbs for depletion of B, NK and T cells prior to separation of CD14 + cells from the CD14 \u00c0 NIPCs with a MACS system (Summerfield et al., 2003) or by just utilizing mAbs recognizing CD172 and either CD4 or CD14 in conjunction with magnetic sorting (Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004) . However, greater consistency, ease of preparation, and a decreased potential for procedural-generated artifacts should be obtainable by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) purification of NIPCs. In this regard, as described here, we have successfully used this approach, first with a traditional device in combination with prior depletion of B and T cells, and later by just two rounds of sorting with a newer, more sophisticated instrument. In either case, the selected CD4 hi CD172 lo subset could be purified to approximately 98% homogeneity with retention of the ability to express IFN-a after exposure to TGEV. They were defined as being pDCs based on their plasmacytoid morphology, greatest constitutive expression of IRF-7 among phenotypically distinct PBMC subsets, and unique responsiveness to virus stimulation characterized by profuse secretion of IFN-a and physical conversion into a DC appearance with an accompanying enhanced synthesis of CD80/86. Moreover, depending on the type of virus or TLR agonist used, a combination of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-g, and TNF-a were released by the cells. In contrast, the purified pDCs appeared to be nearly unresponsive to the arterivirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), in that virus-exposed cells did not mature into DCs, increase IRF-7 expression or synthesize IFN-a but did secrete IL-2.",

Likewise, in preliminary studies we had also associated the combination of these two cell-surface markers with the IFN-a responsiveness of some lymphocytes to viruses and accordingly intended to exploit this phenotype for developing a purification scheme. In this regard, when mAbtreated PBMC were subjected to two-color immunofluor-escent analysis (Fig. 1A , PBMC panel), a low frequency (approximately 0.5%), CD4 hi CD172 lo subset was not only revealed but also appeared to be sufficiently, spatially distinct so as to be amendable to isolation by using a FACS procedure. However, at this time due to the limited efficiency of the available instrument, an initial step whereby cells expressing B and T cell lineage markers were depleted from freshly isolated PBMC samples was instituted. This procedure routinely enabled an approximately four-fold enrichment of CD4 hi CD172 lo cells (Fig. 1A , Lineage depleted panel) with the remainder being mostly CD172 + cells, which are monocytes. Afterwards, a single electronic sorting regularly resulted in the selection of a relatively homogeneous grouping (approximately 98% purity) of CD4 hi CD172 lo cells (Fig. 1A, purity-sorted panel) . Overall, a nearly 200-fold enrichment of this minor PBMC component was achieved by using this process.",

In fact, only a very limited quantity of IFN-a was secreted by the fractions comprised primarily of CD172 + monocytes (<0.4 ng/10 5 cells) or cells of B or T lineage (3.2 ng/10 5 cells). Similarly, the combined number of TGEV-responsive cells in these two groups was approximately 80-fold lower than the frequency observed for the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset.

To determine if the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset of porcine PBMC acted in a similar manner and to thoroughly evaluate their surface phenotype, three-color immunofluorescence flow cytometric analyses of these cells stained for CD4, CD172, and a third variable protein were conducted (Fig. 2) . Examination of the resultant histograms revealed a unimodal distribution Fig. 1 . TGEV-mediated induction of IFN-a production by phenotypically distinct porcine PBMC. After depletion of lineage positive (CD2 + , CD3 + , and/or CD21 + ) cells by using MACS, the remaining porcine PBMC were separated into CD4 hi CD172 lo or predominately CD4 \u00c0 CD172 hi subsets by using a MoFlo 1 cell sorter.

Bars represent the mean AE SEM of a representative experiment (n = 3). Fig. 2 . Expression of surface markers by the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset of porcine PBMC. A portion of a porcine PBMC sample was stained for only CD4 and CD172 and used to prepare the top panel histogram in which the location of the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset is circled. Electronic gating on this demarcated region in similar histograms generated with other PBMC aliquots that were stained specifically for the indicated surface markers with the respective anti-CD mAb (clear areas) or non-specifically with a corresponding, anti-Ig isotype-matched mAb (shaded areas) prior to treatment with anti-CD4 and CD172 mAbs provided the resultant fluorescence distribution data shown in the lower graphs. Bars define the limits of fluorescent intensity representing a positive signal. Representative histograms (n = 3) are shown. of CD1a, CD11a, CD18, CD29, and CD44 among members of the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset and a fairly constant per cell amount of these proteins as evidenced by a low (<30) RCV in regards to the fluorescence intensity of the stained cells. A more variable level of expression of the CD16 was noted as reflected by larger variation in the fluorescence intensity (RCV = 48). Interestingly, while CD1 and CD16 were clearly present in this sampled population, their previous status was classified as being inconsistent (+/\u00c0) (Summerfield and McCullough, 2009 ). Overall, the relative level of expression of MHC class II molecules on individual CD4 hi CD172 lo cells was the most variable (RCV = 70). This phenomenon has been attributed to the CD4 hi CD172 lo cells being in different stages of maturation (Summerfield et al., 2003; Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004) . As previously reported Summerfield et al., 2003; Domeika et al., 2004; Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004) , the myeloid cell marker CD14, the NK and T cell markers, CD2, CD3, CD8a, the B cell marker CD21 as well as the CD45 isoform CD45RA were not detected (data not shown). In addition, the myeloid cell markers CD11c, previously reported as being present (Summerfield et al., 2003) , and CD11b, the CD45 isoform CD45RC, the NK cell adhesion molecule CD56, and the scavenger molecule CD163 seemed to be absent (Fig. 2) . Thus, with the exception of CD16 that is found on the surface of macrophages, monocytes, NK cells, and neutrophils, the porcine CD4 hi C-D172 lo subset does not express lymphoid or myeloid lineage cell markers.",

This abundance is considered to be essential for promoting the rapid production of IFN-a by pDCs in response to interaction with a virus (Coccia et al., 2004; Dai et al., 2004) . Consequently, porcine CD4 hi CD172 lo cells should be the prominent producer of IRF-7 among the pig's blood cells if they are pDCs. Indeed, a comparison of the IRF-7 distribution among various, gated porcine PBMC fractions previously stained for this transcription factor indicated that IRF-7 expression was greatest in the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset ( Fig. 4A and B) . Moreover, this subset was more homogeneous with respect to per cell amounts of IRF-7 as compared to that of the other examined groups, comprised of CD4 \u00c0 CD172 \u00c0 cells, monocytes (CD4 \u00c0 CD172 hi ) or CD4 + lymphocytes (CD4 + CD172 \u00c0 ). In this regard, while the RCV in relation to the individual fluorescence intensity of their stained members of these three groups were 45, 38, and 44, respectively, a lower value of 23 was determined for the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset. Therefore, based on their established status as the primary IFN-a producer, external and internal physical appearances as well as strong constitutive expression of IRF-7, the CD4 hi CD172 lo cells can be considered to be the porcine counterpart of human pDCs.",

With this improvement, a single, enrichment sort resulted in an increased frequency of porcine pDCs of nearly 200fold, from approximately 0.5% to 49% (Fig. 5A) . Moreover, the subsequent purity sort rendered a population that was >98% homogeneous and comparable to that achieved with the first protocol. Furthermore, a similar degree of cell viability (!95%) was retained with either method (data not shown).",

Of the six assayed proteins, IL-6 and TNF-a were the only two to be detected in significant amounts after exposure of the cells to any of the IFN-a inducing entities. Although IL-2 production was not elicited by imiquimod, all of the other agents, including PRRSV, were able to stimulate a low but detectable production of this cytokine. In contrast, both PrV and PRRSV failed to induce detectable IL-8 expression, while the other stimulants elicited a trace amount of this cytokine. Only the two TLR agonists provoked the secretion of a low (<200 pg/ml) amount of IL-12, as previously observed for porcine pDCs responding to similar types of ligands (Vincent et al., 2007) , as well as a modest release of IFN-g. IL-1, IL-4 and IL-10 were not detected in the medium of any of the treated pDCs (data not shown). 3.6. Differential effect of swine viruses and a TLR9 agonist on IRF-7 expression by purified porcine pDCs After a 6 or 9 h incubation period of human pDCs with external stimuli such as herpes simplex virus or IFN-a, the extent of IRF-7 expression was found to be greater than the already strong constitutive level (Izaguirre et al., 2003) . To determine if a similar phenomenon occurred in activated porcine pDCs, the relative amounts of IRF-7 in DCs at 3 and 5 h post-exposure to ODN D19, PRRSV, and TGEV were compared to that in mock-treated cells. As seen in the histograms derived from the analysis of pDCs stained for the presence of intracellular IRF-7, an increase in fluorescent intensity was apparent at either both measurements or just at the earlier time for the TGEV-and ODN D19-treated cells, respectively (Fig. 7A) . These visible changes were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.05) when the MFIs of these samples were compared to that of the respective, non-stimulated, temporal control (Fig. 7B) . In contrast to the demonstrated positive impact of TGEV and ODN D19 on porcine pDC IRF-7 production, no alteration of this protein's quantity was noted in cells incubated with PRRSV.",

When porcine pDCs stimulated for 24 h were examined for these changes, the majority of the ODN D19-and TGEV-treated cells were found to be of a more irregular shape and to have developed dendritic processes ( Fig. 8A and C) . In contrast, a morphological alteration of the pDCs left untreated was not noted while only a minor percentage of those incubated with PRRSV had transitioned. Similarly, the frequency of CD80/86 cells was greater in the ODN D19activated (approximately 2-fold) and TGEV-activated (approximately 5-fold) samples as compared to the mock-treated example ( Fig. 8B and D) . In this case, detectable expression of these two surface proteins by individual pDCs was reduced when PRRSV was present and the resultant value was somewhat intermediate between the approximately 13% and 1% determined for cultured (Fig. 8D ) and freshly purified cells (data not shown), respectively. It should be noted that up-regulation of CD80/86 expression in pDCs just maintained in medium is not unique to porcine cells as their human counterparts act in a similar manner (Ghanekar et al., 1996) .",

For instance, our analysis of electro-nically gated pig CD4 hi CD172 lo cells revealed that, with the exception of CD16, their cell-surface phenotype was similar to that of human and murine pDCs (Liu, 2005) in that no B cell, monocyte, NK cell, or T cell lineage-specific markers were detected. Moreover, in comparison to three other gated PBMC subsets, members of this group were found to constitutively produce the greatest amounts of IRF-7 with the least degree of individual variation as previously observed for human (Izaguirre et al., 2003; Dai et al., 2004) and macaque (Chung et al., 2005) pDCs. Fig. 6 . Porcine virus-or TLR agonist-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokine production by purified porcine pDCs. Puritysorted porcine pDCs were cultured alone (Mock) or with imiquimod, ODN D19, PrV, PRRSV, SIV, or TGEV for 24 h and then the quantities of secreted IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-a, and IFN-g were determined by using the Searchlight chemiluminescent assay. Dotted lines indicate the level of detection (pg/ml) for each cytokine. Significant differences between this value and the quantity of respective cytokine released by virus-or TLR agonist-exposed pDCs are indicated by an (*p 0.05) or (**p 0.01). Bars represent the mean AE SEM of a representative experiment (n = 3). Finally, by focusing on the FACS-purified porcine CD4 hi C-D172 lo cells, we were able to demonstrate associated properties that were reminiscent of those ascribed to human pDCs (Grouard et al., 1997; Siegal et al., 1999; Cella et al., 2000; Liu, 2005; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al., 2008) . These included: their prodigious ability to secrete IFN-a, their plasmacytoid appearance when quiescent, and their morphological conversion to DC-like shapes after exposure to viruses or TLR agonists with an accompanying transient or extended increase in IRF-7 and CD80/86 expression, respectively. Thus, based on these traits, we consider porcine CD4 hi CD172 lo cells to represent pDCs.",

In the pig, CD18 can interact with pDC-expressed CD11a to produce lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1. The resultant heterodimer can bind to the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expressed by activated endothelium at inflammatory sites (Dustin and Springer, 1988) . Likewise, CD29 can form heterodimers, in this case with CD49d, to create the very late activation antigen (VLA)-4 that associates with CD44, also made by porcine pDCs, to enable leukocyte extravasation (Nandi et al., 2004) and trafficking of activated T cells to inflammatory regions (Steeber et al., 2005) . In this regard, migration of TGEV-stimulated, pig NIPCs to lymphoid tissue (Riffault et al., 1997 (Riffault et al., , 2001 Pascale et al., 2008) and of non-activated cells to afferent lymph (Pascale et al., 2008) have been described.",

For example, after exposure of human PBMC to the imidazoquinoline, resquimod, or to herpes simplex virus (HSV), only 31-36% (Gibson et al., 2002) or 25-60% (Feldman et al., 2001; , respectively, of the ''gated'' pDC cell subset contained detectable amounts of intracellular IFN-a. Although a wider variation in the frequencies of human and macaque pDCs responding to HSV was later reported, the maximum percentage did not exceed 80% or 82% for the two respective species (Chung et al., 2005) . Similarly, 10-25% of porcine NIPCs (CD4 + CD172 lo PBMC subset) were identified as reacting to TGEV (Summerfield et al., 2003) . Likewise, in the present study where an ELISPOT analysis was used in lieu of the previous multicolor immunofluorescence flow cytometry-based ones, 7-10% of the sorted porcine pDCs were found to have secreted IFN-a in response to TGEV stimulation. This lower frequency of responsive cells was probably not due to the isolation procedure negatively impacting functionality since concurrent exposure of the purified pDCs to TGEV and ODN D19 resulted in a cumulative increase in the number of IFN-a synthesizing cells (data not shown). Moreover, the majority (>70%) could still morph into DC after exposure to either TGEV or the TLR-9 agonist. Rather, this disparity may reflect differences in the spectrum of pDC function due to their relative proportions in the various stages of maturation (Duramad et al., 2003) , the greater sensitivity of cytokine flow cytometry versus ELISPOT in detecting IFN-a production at the single cell level (Karlsson et al., 2003) , and/or variance in the frequency of a pig's peripheral blood pDCs due to the animal's age and genetic factors .",

In this regard, a FACS step was required to remove otherwise contaminating, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) from the human pDC subset before resolving their questionable, functional plasticity in regards to IFN-a and IL-12 production (Ito et al., 2006) . Thus, our employment of novel sorting protocols for purifying members of the CD4 hi CD172 lo subset has circumvented a potentially similar problem regarding the characterization of activated and resting porcine pDCs.",

Consequently, as observed, the majority of the ODN D19-and TGEV-treated cells underwent differentiation as indicated by morphological changes and the increased presence of cell-surface CD80/86 while the PRRSV-exposed cells remained relatively inert. Likewise, as with human pDCs, only the activated pDCs also secreted IL-6 which in conjunction with type I IFNs induces B cells to differentiate into Ab-secreting plasma cells (Jego et al., 2003; Poeck et al., 2004) . Interestingly, the porcine pDCs universally responded to all of the viruses, including PRRSV, and both TLR agonists with secretion of IL-2. Although T cells primarily synthesize this cytokine, stimulated human pDCs can act in a similar manner and in doing so induce B, NK, and T cells to proliferate (Feau et al., 2005; Naranjo-Gomez et al., 2007) . In contrast, synthesis of other cytokines appeared to be dependent on the type of eliciting agent. For instance, IL-8, a chemokine also produced by activated human pDCs and involved in the attraction of neutrophils to sites of inflammation (Penna et al., 2002; Bendriss-Vermare et al., 2005) , was preferentially made by cells exposed to TGEV. Low quantities of IL-12 and IFN-g were only secreted after induction by the TLR-7 and 9 ligands. IL-12 is also generated by human pDCs but only in very low amounts (Liu, 2005; Ito et al., 2006) . Murine pDCs produce greater amounts of this cytokine (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001) and an early developmental stage of these cells, the Ly6C-Ly49Q-subtype, secretes moderate amounts of IFN-g (Vremec et al., 2007) . Therefore, the observed cytokine response profiles of highly purified populations of porcine pDCs are consistent with those reported for other mammalian pDCs.",

In this regard, it should be noted that both commercial vaccines and some swine farm-endemic viruses used for ''controlled exposure'' of na\u00efve pigs have also been found to be incapable of eliciting IFN-a secretion by porcine pDCs (unpublished results). We have postulated (Meier et al., 2004; Royaee et al., 2004 ) that the absence of this innate immune response to infection or vaccination with PRRSV could be at least partly responsible for the belated production of specific virus-neutralizing antibodies (Lopez and Osorio, 2004) and the delayed onset and protracted development of a cell-mediated immune response of pigs against this virus (Meier et al., 2003) . Accordingly, while type I cytokines are needed to incite the generation of virus-specific IFN-g secreting T cells (Cella et al., 2000; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly et al., 2008) , the quantity of this cytokine in the blood of PRRSV-infected pigs was conspicuously lower than that reported for animals receiving PrV or TGEV (Artursson et al., 1995; Albina et al., 1998b) . Moreover, at the primary site of PRRSV replication, the lungs, IFN-a was either undetected or at a reduced amount in PRRSV-infected animals as compared to ones inoculated with porcine respiratory coronavirus, SIV, or TGEV (Albina et al., 1998b; VanReeth et al., 1999) . Though at this location macrophages are the virus's primary target and as such would be considered to be a source of type I IFNs due to intracellular triggering by double-stranded, virus replicative intermediates, such cells exposed to PRRSV in vitro secreted undetectable or minor quantities of IFN-a (Albina et al., 1998a; Lee et al., 2004) .",

Other viruses have previously been shown to achieve the same outcome by not only suppressing the IFN-a response to themselves but also to other known stimulants. For instance, porcine circovirus type 2 can reduce porcine NIPC activity via interaction with its DNA genome (Vincent et al., 2007) . A similar type of inhibition is directed to human pDCs by the V protein of measles virus (Pfaller and Conzelmann, 2008) and presumably the NS proteins of clinical isolates of respiratory syncytial virus (Schlender et al., 2005) . Although a European strain of PRRSV did not exhibit such a repressive nature towards TGEV-activated NIPCs (Albina et al., 1998a) , we have observed suppression of TGEV-and TLR9 agonist-induced production of IFN-a by purified porcine pDCs in the presence of either attenuated or virulent, North American PRRSV isolates (unpublished results). Therefore, like these other pathogens, PRRSV may render an afflicted host more susceptible to secondary infections due to blockage of the innate immune response provided by pDCs.",

(B) Histograms of CD80/86 stained pDCs that were either freshly purified (shaded areas) or previously incubated in the absence or presence of a virus or TLR9 agonist (solid line, clear areas). Horizontal bars define the limits of fluorescent intensity representing a positive signal. (C) Frequencies of pDCs exhibiting a DC morphology after incubation in the absence or presence of a virus or TLR9 agonist. Diff-Quick 1 stained pDCs having an irregular cell surface and dendrites were scored as having matured into DCs. (D) Frequencies of pDCs expressing CD80/86 after incubation in the absence or presence of a virus or TLR9 agonist. Values represent percentages of clear areas designated as being within the positive signal range in histograms of CD80/86 stained pDCs (B). A representative experiment (n = 3) is shown.",
