Current clinical observation suggest that people's age and gender are two risk factors in the susceptibility to COVID-19 1 . Older people and men are more susceptible to infection and development of more severe disease. However, no biological markers have been identified to predict the susceptibility to COVID-19 so far. Landsteiner's ABO blood types are carbohydrate epitopes that are present on the surface of human cells. The antigenic determinants of A and B blood groups are trisaccharide moieties GalNAc\u03b11-3-(Fuc\u03b11,2)-Gal\u03b2-and Gal\u03b11-3-(Fuc\u03b11,2)-Gal\u03b2-, while O blood group antigen is Fuc\u03b11,2-Gal\u03b2-. While blood types are genetically inherited, the environment factors can potentially influence which blood types in a population will be passed on more frequently to the next generation. Susceptibility of viral infection has been found to be related to ABO blood group. For example, Norwalk virus and Hepatitis B have clear blood group susceptibility 2,3 . It was also reported that blood group O individuals were less likely to become infected by SARS coronavirus 4 . Here, we investigated the relationship between the ABO blood type and the susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China to test if the former may function as a biomarker for the latter.",

A similar distribution pattern of high-risk blood group A and low-risk blood group O was observed in the dead patients. Specifically, the proportions of blood groups A, B, AB and O in the 206 dead patients were 41.26%, 24.27%, 9.22% and 25.24%, respectively. Blood group O was associated with a lower risk of death compared with non-O groups, with an OR of 0.660 (95% CI 0.479~0.911, P = 0.014,",
