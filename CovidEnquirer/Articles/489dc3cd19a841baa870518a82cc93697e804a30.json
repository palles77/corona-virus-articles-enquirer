Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were health care workers. At admission, 50 patients (74.6%) had abnormal chest radiographs, and all patients developed pulmonary infiltrates during the following week. During hospitalization, lymphopenia was found in 57 patients (85.1%); and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; n = 55; 83.3%), C-reactive protein (n = 55; 83.3%), aminotransferases (n = 44; 65.7%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 20.9%) were also noted. ARDS developed in 33 patients (49.3%), who were generally older than the patients in whom ARDS did not develop, male, non-health care workers, and who generally had dyspnea at the time of diagnosis, and a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension or cerebrovascular accident. Patients with, versus those without, ARDS also tended to present with more severe lymphopenia and leukocytosis, and with higher levels of LDH and aspartate aminotransferase. The overall mortality rate was 31.3% (21/67), whereas the rate for patients who developed ARDS was 63.6% (21/33). Multivariate analyses showed that age greater than 65 years (odds ratio, OR, 10.6; 95% confidence interval, CI, 2.1-54.1), pre-existing diabetes mellitus (OR, 13.7; 95% CI, 1.3-146.9), and elevated levels of LDH (OR, 8.4; 95% CI, 1.9-36.9) at admission, were independent predictors of ARDS.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious pulmonary disease that appears to have originated in southern China in the fall of 2002. The disease then spread to other parts of Asia, Europe and North America, with more than 8,000 cases now reported worldwide. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The first two SARS cases in Taiwan were diagnosed in a couple on March 14, 2003;  6 the man had traveled to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong in February 2003. The couple was treated successfully in an intensive care unit (ICU) at medical center A. Subsequently, most SARS patients were treated at that medical center, until two clusters of cases were noted in late April, 2003, in Taipei. The origin of the outbreak was a laundry worker, aged 42 years, with diabetes mellitus, who was employed at hospital B. 7 As the index patient had been symptomatic for 6 days before SARS was diagnosed, the number of potentially exposed persons was estimated to be 10,000 patients and visitors, and 930 staff. Within less than 2 weeks, another outbreak of SARS clusters occurred in hospital C, which is near hospital B. Taipei Veterans General Hospital undertook the care of critically ill SARS patients, who were mainly transferred from hospital B and hospital C. The cause of SARS is a novel coronavirus. [8] [9] [10] [11] Natural clinical histories have ranged from febrile respiratory symptoms, without hypoxemia, to respiratory distress requiring intubation and, occasionally, resulting in death. [3] [4] Worldwide, the substantial mortality associated with SARS has varied markedly from 15-27%. 5 This paper provides a retrospective review of predictive factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with SARS treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital.",

To date, however, no large, formal analysis of the data from Taiwan can Since our hospital was responsible for the management of critical cases in northern Taiwan, the outcomes shown were more severe than in other medical settings. Initial clinical presentations and laboratory features were similar to those in other series. Symptoms of acute respiratory distress developed in about half of the patients (33/67; 49.3%); 21 of these patients (63.6%) died and the other 12 were discharged from hospital. The risk factors for ARDS were age more than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and elevated LDH level. Other researchers have also documented independent predictors associated with poor outcomes, e.g. acute illness leading to death; the need for mechanical ventilation; and ICU admission. 2 The diagnosis of SARS was based on a comprehensive contact history and precise laboratory tests. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SARS have a reported sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 96%, 14 whereas the sensitivity of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV is less than 80%. 15 Since contact history has not been reliable after SARS cluster cases were noted in some community groups, one needed to be highly suspicious of any transmission of pneumonia. Our inclusion criteria added a component of transmission of pneumonia, and a high degree of clinical diagnostic accuracy was confirmed by laboratory tests. Hematologic abnormalities, especially lymphopenia, were common in our cohort, probably because of ribavirin therapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given when more severe hematologic abnormalities occurred. Pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis were noted in 2 patients without ARDS. This pheno-menon has been noted in other viral infections, and the outcome was fair after supportive treatment. 16, 17 In our cohort, elevation of AST was more obvious than that of ALT in the ARDS group.

The location of pulmonary infiltration in SARS patients has been reported to be the peripheral lungs. 18, 19 In our cohort, initial infiltrative lesions were mainly located in the central and peripheral lungs. The best explanation for this is that anterior and posterior peripheral lesions would be projected to a central location on posteroanterior chest radiograph. The efficacy of treatment was difficult to evaluate because patients usually received a combination of medications, including antiviral, broad-spectrum antibacterial and corticosteroid drugs, in addition to supportive therapy. Initially, because the cause of SARS was thought to be an atypical pathogen, 55 patients (82.1%) received empiric antibacterial therapy with a fluoroquinolone. Levofloxacin was the drug of choice in 49 patients (73.1%) because of its broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic and aerobic Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria. In patients who developed ARDS, stronger antibiotics such as fourth-generation cephalosporins, teicoplanin and carbapenems were more often used. There is no proven effective treatment for SARS; hence, there was no difference in the proportion of patients per group who received the antiviral ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or moderate amounts of corticosteroids. However, pulse corticosteroid therapy was more often used for ARDS than non-ARDS patients.",
