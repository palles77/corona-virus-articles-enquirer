            "text": "The ductus arteriosus carries blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta in the fetus. Within hours of the birth the ductus normally closes in response to an increase in the oxygen tension of the blood; failure of closure allows continual shunting of blood between the left and right sides of the heart. After birth, the blood pressure in the pulmonary artery reduces and the systemic blood pressure increases. Typically this pressure differential is such that blood shunts continuously through the cardiac cycle, from the higher pressure aorta to the lower pressure pulmonary artery (i.e., left to right shunting) if the ductus remains patent. The secondary changes that occur with increased blood flowing in the pulmonary artery are pulmonary over-circulation, left atrial dilatation, left ventricular dilatation with eccentric hypertrophy, dilatation of the aortic arch to the level of the origin of the PDA, and dilatation of the pulmonary trunk. As a consequence of the left to right shunting and left-sided volume overload, left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) commonly develops. The size of the shunt will determine volume of blood shunting, which in turn determines the onset and severity of secondary consequences. As a sequel to the increased blood flow in the pulmonary vessels, resistance to blood flow and pulmonary hypertension can develop. If the pulmonary arterial pressure is greater than the aortic pressure for some or all of the cardiac cycle, blood flow through the PDA will reverse. Blood will then flow from the pulmonary artery into the aorta (i.e., right to left shunting). Right to left shunting can also occur from birth, and usually occurs when the ductus is large and tubular without narrowing at the pulmonary ostium, and this may reflect retention of fetal pulmonary vasculature. Right to left shunting, termed Eisenmenger's physiology, is rarely reported in cats, 2,3 although it is suggested that it is more likely to develop over time in cats than dogs. 4 Surgical treatment of the PDA is contraindicated in patients with right to left shunting.",

However, in an abstract reporting 21 cases of PDAs in cats approximately two-thirds had a continuous murmur but the remainder were described to have systolic murmurs and approximately only one-third of the cats in the study were asymptomatic at presentation. Their presenting complaints included abnormal respiration, exercise intolerance/lethargy, stunted growth, and poor weight gain. 7 The murmur is well described in dogs; it may be accompanied by a thrill felt at the heart base, and by hyperkinetic pulses. The point of maximal intensity of the murmur lies over the main pulmonary artery at the dorsocranial heart base and may radiate cranially to the thoracic inlet and to the right heart base. It is suggested that in cats the continuous murmur of a PDA may be best heard slightly more ventrally than this typical location in dogs. Femoral pulses may be more difficult to assess in cats; 8 hyperkinetic pulses may be noted.",

Left ventricular systolic function may become impaired.

This condition is rarely diagnosed in cats, but it has been reported in a cat with dilated cardiomyopathy. 20 It is uncommon in dogs; underlying causes have included IPHE, intrapericardial foreign body, chronic septic pericarditis, and traumatic pericardial hemorrhage. Diagnosis can be difficult, and is easier if a small volume of PE is present. Thoracic radiographs may show mild to moderate cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and distension of the caudal vena cava. Echocardiography may demonstrate suggestive changes such as flattening of the left ventricular free wall in diastole and abnormal septal motion. Invasive hemodynamic studies to measure central venous pressure changes may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.",

The cat may be positioned in lateral or sternal recumbency, depending on clinician preference and the tolerance of the patient. Pericardiocentesis can be performed through a right or left lateral approach. ECG monitoring should be performed throughout the procedure. The landmark for pericardiocentesis is found by palpation of the point of maximal intensity of the heart beat; this is typically the ventral 6 th -7 th intercostal space and is confirmed using ultrasonography. The area is clipped and prepared for surgery and local anesthetic can be instilled into the skin, subcutaneous tissues, intercostal muscles, and pleura at the site of proposed catheter entry through the chest wall. Pericardiocentesis is performed as a sterile procedure using aseptic technique. A tiny stab incision is made in the skin at the point of catheter insertion and a 16-18G 2.5 inch over the needle catheter is introduced through the chest wall in a direction aimed towards the opposite scapula. Extra holes can be cut in the catheter near the tip to increase the efficiency of drainage. The catheter is slowly introduced through the chest wall and through the pericardium. If the tip of the catheter can be felt touching the surface of the heart and/or the patient develops arrhythmias, the catheter should be withdrawn several millimeters before being redirected. Once sanguinous fluid is seen in the hub of the catheter, or the catheter is identified within the pericardial sac if performing the entire procedure under ultrasonographic guidance, the needle is removed and the catheter is connected to a piece of extension tubing and a 20-50 mL syringe. The catheter is advanced several more millimeters into the pericardial sac and fluid is aspirated. To confirm that the fluid is not being withdrawn from a blood vessel or the heart, the fluid can be observed for one to two minutes for the presence of clotting. PE will not clot, whilst blood collected from the heart or a blood vessel will clot. Once the catheter is within the pericardial sac the pericardial fluid is drained. Ultrasonography should be performed to confirm removal of the effusion. At the completion of pericardiocentesis the catheter can be withdrawn.",

In these circumstances the pericardium is subject to the same environment and is also likely to become thickened and less compliant and there may be a consequential increase in venous pressures. Even a modest increase could cause the formation of extra lymphatics in the cranial thorax; these lymphatics may then leak. Thus a thickened, noncompliant pericardium may contribute to the development of chylothorax, and conversely chylothorax may cause pericardial thickening or fibrosing pericarditis. The actual role that the pericardium has in the development of and progression of chylothorax is unknown but pericardectomy, in combination with thoracic duct ligation with or without thoracic omentalization, has been shown in several small case series to achieve a successful resolution of the disease in approximately 75-80% cats. 18, 19 Subtotal pericardectomy (see Box 48-4) has been successful in some cats as the sole treatment of chylothorax. It has also been suggested that it may be used to treat and/or prevent the serosanguinous effusions that occasionally occur in some patients after thoracic duct ligation. 18 Further studies are required to investigate these apparent benefits of pericardectomy. Section Thorax | 6 | suspected, or has been identified involving both sides of the heart base, a median sternotomy may be the preferred approach. 26 A median sternotomy gives good access to both the left and right sides of the heart and allows easier identification of both phrenic nerves at surgery. Thus, pericardectomy may be technically easier via median sternotomy. A median sternotomy also reduces the requirement for manipulation of the heart during surgery, and thus reduces the likelihood of associated intraoperative arrhythmias and it allows exploration of both the right and left sides of the heart base if required.",

The phrenic nerves are identified as they cross the pericardium. They are preserved by very careful dissection to free them from the pericardium; fine ophthalmic surgical scissors may be helpful to perform this delicate dissection. The apex of the heart is gently shifted to the right side of the thorax to aid access to the left heart base using the surgeon's or surgical assistant's fingers, or a malleable retractor wrapped in a saline-moistened surgical sponge, and likewise the apex is gently shifted to the left to improve access to the right side. The apex of the heart is gently moved in a cranial direction to access the caudal heart base. The anesthetist should be warned prior to these manipulations as they can result in a reduction in cardiac output or arrhythmias. Dissection should be temporarily halted to allow recovery (and adjustment of retraction if necessary) in the event of reduced cardiac output and/or arrhythmias. Saline-moistened umbilical tape is placed around the phrenic nerves once they have been freed from the pericardium, so they can gently be retracted away from the heart. The pericardium is incised/entered towards the apex of the heart and any PE is removed by suction. The pericardium is then incised towards the heart base. Once nearing the base of the heart, stay sutures are placed in the pericardium on either side of the incision to allow retraction and aid exposure so that the great vessels can clearly be identified and avoided. The pericardium is then dissected circumferentially around the heart base, close to the great vessels 26 leaving a small remaining 'rim' of pericardium (approximately 5 mm).

Small tears to these vessels may be managed by the immediate application of digital pressure, but continued dissection may result in further hemorrhage as the tear in the damaged vessel may enlarge. A decision must be made whether to continue with surgery, or abandon the procedure on",
