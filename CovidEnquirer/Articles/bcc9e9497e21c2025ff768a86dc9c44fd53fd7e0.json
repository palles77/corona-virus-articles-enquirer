None of the Group 0 patients showed seroconversion, while the seroconversion rate gradually increased with increasing disease severity (0.0%, 60.0%, 93.8%, and 100% in Group 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively; P = 0.001). Group 3 patients showed delayed increment of antibody titers during the fourth week, while Group 2 patients showed robust increment of antibody titer during the third week. Among patients having pneumonia, 75% of deceased patients did not show seroconversion by the third week, while 100% of the survived patients were seroconverted (P = 0.003).",

To understand this fatal respiratory viral infection, several serologic investigations have been conducted (Corman et al., 2016; Min et al., 2016; Park et al., 2015; Payne et al., 2016) . However, practical analysis of serodiagnostic parameters for clinical usage was limited in previous studies, due to insufficient sample size or clinical information. We managed 45 MERS-CoV-infected patients, which is the largest number of patients as a single center during the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak (total 186 patients identified) Kim et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016) , and reported that MERS-CoV-infected patients experienced 4 distinct clinical courses, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation . Based on these findings, we evaluated serologic response of 42 MERS-CoV-infected patients according to the disease severity to investigate potential role of serodiagnostic parameters as prognostic markers.",

Epidemiologic investigation data and electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain exact exposure date, symptom onset, clinical course, and outcome data for the patients. One or 2 residual serum samples per week of illness were used for serologic testing during hospitalization periods. Follow-up serum samples obtained at outpatient clinics were also tested up to 6 months from symptom onset. The institutional review board of Samsung Medical Center approved the present study.",

Only 25% of deceased patients showed seroconversion by the end of the third week of illness, while 100% of survived patients seroconverted (P = 0.003, Table 2 ). This difference also could be discriminated by ELISA IgG (with OD ratio cutoff value of 0.4, P = 0.003) and ELISA IgA (with OD ratio cutoff value of 0.2, P = 0.010). IFA IgM response was not significantly different between survivors and non-survivors (with intensity cutoff value of weakly positive, P = 0.135). In a Kaplan-Meier analysis comparing seroconverted patients and non-converted patients by the third week of illness, seroconverted patients showed significantly higher survival probability compared to patients with negative seroconversion (Fig. 2 , P b 0.001 by log-rank test). Negative seroconversion in pneumonia patients by the third week of illness showed a hazard ratio of 27.83 (95% CI 2.76-280.21, P = 0.005, by the Cox proportional hazard model) in predicting 6-week mortality.",

In that study, a robust increment of ELISA IgG titer with a 3-fold increase in OD ratio was exclusively observed among patients with severe pneumonia, while mild infections exhibited a modest increment in OD ratio, if any. Likewise, we noted that asymptomatic MERS-CoV-infected cases did not show serologic response including PRNT within 6 months, and the seroconversion rate increased with the disease severity. Although the number of asymptomatic patients was limited to 3 in the present analysis, it is less likely that asymptomatic patients will experience seroconversion considering that even Group 1 patients with obvious MERS-related symptoms showed low seroconversion rate of 60%. This finding correlates with another serologic study that evaluated 11 rRT-PCR-confirmed MERS patients (Choe et al., 2017) . In that study, antibody titers in 4 of 6 patients with mild illness were undetectable. In addition, most contact surveys of MERS-CoV could not detect additional rRT-PCR-negative PRNTpositive MERS-CoV infections (Breakwell et al., 2015; Buchholz et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2016; . These findings imply that serologic surveys to detect subclinical infections among asymptomatic individuals would not be effective.",

Delayed commencement of serologic response in severe disease was also suggested by previous report by Park et al. (Park et al., 2015) . Although seroconversion timing was not statistically significantly delayed in Group 3 patients in the present study, delayed increment of IgG, IgA, and IgM titers after the third week was demonstrated in Group 3.

Impaired serologic response in deceased patient was also noted in the paper of Corman et al., but insufficient clinical information, especially day of symptom onset, hampered more detailed analysis in association with timeline (Corman et al., 2016) . In this study, we could obtain exact clinical information including day of symptom onset, and figured it out that seroconversion status by the third week of illness (by 21 dpoi) can serve as a prognostic marker. Another important point is that MERS-CoV-infected patients in the present analysis died later than previous reports, probably owing to antiviral therapy or aggressive critical care including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The median interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in the present study, which is much longer than 11.5 days in previous reports (Zumla et al., 2015) . Although rapidly deteriorating MERS cases would die before the third week of illness, there certainly is a population that benefit from prognosis prediction by serologic response. Aggressive managements including ECMO should be considered for pneumonia patients without seroconversion by the third week of illness. Although seroconversion status can be confirmed by neutralization tests, it cannot be readily performed worldwide (Corman et al., Table 1 Seroconversion status of MERS-CoV-infected patients according to the disease severity group.",

In the present analysis, seroconversion status of the third week assessed by ELISA IgG and IgA was similar with that by PRNT. These ELISA tests can be practically used for predicting poor prognosis of MERS pneumonia in the field of patient management. As a retrospective study, serum samples of each patient could not be collected with same interval. However, we applied strict criteria for seroconversion, excluding patients who did not have follow-up samples after the third week of illness as indeterminate response. In the previous report with the same patient population, we also suggest predictive factors for disease progression using clinical variables within 3 days from symptom onset . Together with the present paper, these factors could be used complementarily in managing MERS-CoV-infected patients. In addition, although we identified that seroconversion status by the third week was associated with fatal outcomes of MERS pneumonia, we could not perform multivariate analysis due to limited sample size. This finding need to be further evaluated with enough patient numbers of MERS pneumonia.",
