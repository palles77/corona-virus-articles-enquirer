            "text": "Rapid methods for the detection and clinical treatment of human norovirus (HuNoV) are needed to control foodborne disease outbreaks, but reliable techniques that are fast and sensitive enough to detect small amounts of HuNoV in food and aquatic environments are not yet available. We explore the interactions between HuNoV and concanavalin A (Con A), which could facilitate the development of a sensitive detection tool for HuNoV. Biophysical studies including hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that when the metal coordinated region of Con A, which spans Asp16 to His24, is converted to nine alanine residues (mCon A MCR ), the affinity for HuNoV (GII.4) diminishes, demonstrating that this Ca 2\u00fe and Mn 2\u00fe coordinated region is responsible for the observed virus-protein interaction. The mutated carbohydrate binding region of Con A (mCon A CBR ) does not affect binding affinity significantly, indicating that MCR of Con A is a major region of interaction to HuNoV (GII.4). The results further contribute to the development of a HuNoV concentration tool, Con A-immobilized polyacrylate beads (Con A-PAB), for rapid detection of genotypes from genogroups I and II (GI and GII). This method offers many advantages over currently available methods, including a short concentration time. HuNov (GI and GII) can be detected in just 15 min with 90% recovery through Con A-PAB application. In addition, this method can be used over a wide range of pH values (pH 3.0 e 10.0). Overall, this rapid and sensitive detection of HuNoV (GI and GII) will aid in the prevention of virus transmission pathways, and the method developed here may have applicability for other foodborne viral infections.",

HuNoV is responsible for more than 90% of viral gastroenteritis and more than 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks; this virus causes acute diarrhea and vomiting, which typically resolve within 2 or 3 days, but can result in lifethreatening dehydration in children and the elderly [7, 11] .",

Hence, electron microscopy, immunological tests, electrochemical sensing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular assays have been adopted to detect NoV [14] . Despite the fact that electrochemical biosensing, using NoV-specific aptamers, is rapid, sensitive and accurate, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) are the gold standards for NoV detection due to their wide applicability. However, sample preparation for these methods to detect viral contamination in food and water is complicated by factors such as large sample volumes, low viral titers, and compounds that interfere with nucleic acid amplification [15] . Methods available for NoV concentration, such as swab sampling, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, ultracentrifugation, cationic separation, immune concentration, and organic flocculation, have limitations due to their narrow pH ranges, time requirements, and difficulties in handling multiple samples at a time [16, 17] . Therefore, an alternative method is necessary to overcome the limitations of such methods.",

The interaction between HuNoV (GII.4) and Con A was also characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biolayer interferometry (BLI) through mutational studies. Furthermore, a rapid technique for use with PCR assay using specific primers for the detection of HuNoV was developed to concentrate specific HuNoV via Con A immobilization on polyacrylate beads (Con A-PAB). This application was evaluated by measuring the recovery of different genotypes of GI and GII HuNoV from different food matrices at broad pH ranges. Overall, this rapid and sensitive detection of HuNoV will aid in the prevention of virus transmission pathways, and the method developed here may have applicability for other foodborne viral infections, especially HuNoV (GI and GII).",

Interactions between HuNoV (GII.4) and Con A Interactions between Con A and the purified P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4) were characterized by HDX studies in order to identify putative interaction regions ( Fig. 1A and Supporting Figs. 1e3), since the GII.4 strain of HuNoV is a major cause of viral infections. Time-dependent HDX showed that the metal coordinated region (MCR), including Ile17, Gly18, and Asp19 of Con A ( Fig. 1B and C) , interacts with the P-domain of HuNoV (GII.4) as indicated by significant deuterium exchange alterations in this region from the Con A only and Con A-P-domain conjugated experiment. The structural analysis based on preliminary reports proposed that MCR is positioned on the outer region of Con A, and that it coordinated with metal ions including Mn 2\u00fe and Ca 2\u00fe . The HDX results from Con A alone support that amino acids from Thr15 to Asp16 show high deuterium exchange rates, and Ile17 and Gly18 show to be rapidly changed starting from 5 s exposure ( Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) . These results suggested that MCR may generate a complex between HuNoV (GII.4) and Con A. Con A have shown that hetero-metal ions are essential for the proper orientation of the key residues that mediate the carbohydrate specific interactions with hydrogen bonds, but coordination is required to control the directions of the side and main chains in Con A. Our mutational studies of MCR and CBR confirmed that metal coordination is crucial for HuNoV (GII.4) interactions (shown below). In addition to these amino acid regions, the dimerization region (DR), which is involved in dimer formation in Con A, is slow to deuterium exchange as shown in Fig. 1D [33] . The results from time-dependent HDX suggested that Con A interacts with the Pdomain of HuNoV (GII.4) primarily through the MCR, because the carbohydrate binding region (CBR) of Con A, including L99, Y100, does not show significant changes in deuterium exchange rate. The HDX results provide valuable information for the understanding of interactions between Con A and HuNoV (GII.4).",

The dissociation constant (K D ) value indicates the interaction kinetics of an analyte and ligand; the K D values for the interaction of native Con A, mCon A CBR , and mCon A MCR with HuNoV (GII.4) were These values indicate that the interaction kinetics of mCon A MCR with HuNoV (GII.4) was greatly reduced compared to native Con A and mCon A CBR , suggesting that the MCR (residues 16e24) participates in the interaction with HuNoV (GII.4), whereas the CBR does not show significant changes in dissociation constant. A previous study reported that HuNoV interacts with carbohydrates [34] , which suggests its binding to multiple monosaccharide moieties present in food materials. For example, glycan, a milk oligosaccharide, was reported to interact with HuNoV capsids [35] . Hydroxyl moieties in carbohydrates cause non-specific hydrogen bonding with the main and side chains of lectins [36] , but the MCR of Con A was proposed as a major binding region of HuNoV (GII.4) through mutational studies. The mCon A MCR lost its binding affinity due to structural disruption of the MCR. The mutated residues of MCR and CBR in Con A (PDB accession: 3NWK) are depicted in mesh ( Fig. 2B and C) [37] . In addition, apo-Con A (metal-free Con A) also showed decreased binding affinity when compared to metal-bound Con A (Fig. 3) . This result indicates that chelating Ca 2\u00fe and Mn 2\u00fe ions with EDTA could affect the secondary structures required for specific interactions with HuNoV, which supports the involvement of the MCR in binding to HuNoV. The subtle differences in structure between metal coordinated-and apo-Con A were observed around the MCR in a superimposed image (Fig. 3B) . These results proposed that metal ions coordinated through residues in the MCR were positioned properly to interact with HuNoV (GII.4), since the superimposed structures of the MCR proved that atoms from the side and main chains have different directions.",

The inability of SBA to interact with the HuNoV (GII.4) could be due to low sequence identity, despite almost identical structures. Furthermore, the MCR of Con A does not show sequence similarity to SBA.

Thus, the application of Con A to concentrate HuNoV for the rapid detection of the virus in food was tested. The conventional PEG concentration method is both time consuming and has a low sampling number, which makes it a stumbling block for the rapid analysis of HuNoV. Instead, Con A-immobilized polyacrylate beads (Con A-PAB) were developed, as explained in the methods section (Fig. 5A) , to be used in our new concentration method. The ability and stability of Con A to detect HuNoV (GII.4) was tested over pH ranges from 3 to 10 as HuNoV is usually found in contaminated foods of varying pHs (Fig. 5B) . The percentage of viral recovery was not significantly affected by changes in pH, demonstrating an advantage of using Con A-PAB as a concentration tool over some of the currently available methods. This attribute is an improvement over other HuNoV detection methods that are limited to a narrow range of pH [17] . HuNoV was detected up to 10 1 RT-PCR units/mL, which meets the standard PCR detection level. This method was successful in recovering HuNoV (GII.4), with a virus recovery (%) of more than 77% when samples were spiked with virus concentrations ranging from 10 3 to 10 6 RT-PCR units/mL as determined by PCR (Fig. 5C) . Moreover, using Con A-PAB containing 3.0 g of Con A immobilized beads, the capacity of HuNoV (GII.4) capture was up to 10 4 copy numbers. However, the performance of the Con A-PAB could be enhanced by increasing the amount of Con A and the surface areas of the concentration tool. Using Con A-PAB, HuNoV recovery reached more than 90% in 15 min at an eluent flow rate of 13.5 mL/ min (Fig. 5D ). From these initial results, we found that the stability of Con A is great for detection, and it maintains interaction with HuNoV (GII.4) in a broad range of pHs and flow-rates, suggesting that the Con A-PAB could serve as a novel concentration tool with high recovery of HuNoV (GII.4). Besides this, Con A-PAB, a method based on solid phase extraction, has other advantages, such as ease of handling several samples concurrently and speed for concentration of the virus.",

Among seven HuNoV genogroups (GI -GVII), GI and GII, consisting of 9 and 19 genotypes, respectively, are the most common cause of human infections. The binding specificity of Con A-PAB with these genotypes was analyzed in seven samples, comprising two and five different genotypes of the GI and GII genogroups, respectively. These genotypes had varying recoveries ranging from 41.8% to 90.6% (Fig. 6A, Supporting table 1 ). Among them, GII.4, which has been associated with the majority of global epidemics in the past decade [41] , was recovered at the highest level (90.6%), followed by GII.2, GII.8, GII.17 and GII.6 (85.2%, 77.8%, 61.4 and 41.8% recovery, respectively). Among tested genotypes, GII.4, GII.2 and GII.6 are responsible for the majority (77.5%) of total HuNoV outbreaks in the US from 2009 to 2013 [42] . However, genotypes of GI including GI.3 and GI.8 were recovered at only 68.5% and 56.2% levels, respectively. The variability between GI and GII could be due to subtle differences in amino acid sequences between these subtypes. For example, the VP1 domains of HuNoV strains from the same genogroups have 70e90% P-domain sequence similarity; however, different genogroups have less than 50% sequence similarity [42, 43] . Superimposed structures of the P-domain of GI.8 and GII.4 show high structural similarity (r.m.s. \u00bc 1.15, C a alignment), which may explain the ability of Con A to bind to the Pdomain of both subtypes despite sequence differences (Fig. 6B) . HuNoV from genogroup I shows different sequences from genogroup II, but GI.3 and GI.8 have greater than 50% recovery. The percentages of virus recovery of HuNoV from GII.2 and GII.4 were greater than 80% with the Con A-PAB when the virus copy number was higher than 10 3 , which is sufficient to amplify the viral RNA in order to confirm HuNoV contamination in food samples. These results demonstrate that Con A-PAB can be successfully applied for the detection of HuNov (GII.2, GII.4, and GII.8) and other genotypes (GI.3, GI.8, GII.6, and GII.17).",

Different food samples (200 mL) were spiked with 4.7 \u00c2 10 4 copies of HuNoV (GII.4). Tris-glycine beef extract buffer was used as an elution buffer for recovery of GII.4 from food samples [44] . The ability of Con A-PAB to concentrate the virus from different foods, such as lettuce, strawberries, and milk, was evaluated. Con A-PAB exhibited significantly higher viral recovery from lettuce compared to that of the PEG precipitation (p \u00bc 0.035). Both methods showed similar recovery from strawberries (Table 2) . Interestingly, Con A-PAB was successful in recovering GII.4 from milk with 60.8% recovery, whereas the PEG method was not successful for this application. These results suggest that the performance of Con A-PAB is less affected by food types than PEG precipitation. Using Con A-PAB, the maximum level of HuNoV was recovered in 15 min, whereas PEG required more than 4e6 h. These results demonstrate that the use of Con A-PAB exhibits comparable viral recovery to the conventional PEG method, and enables faster concentration.",

The mutational studies of MCR and CBR proved that interaction between Con A and HuNoV are dependent on metal coordination and sequence around the MCR because SBA and apo-Con A did not show specific intractions to HuNov. These results proved that the orientations of side and main chains are critical for the generation of specific interactions with HuNoV (GII.4). A HuNoV concentration tool, Con A-PAB, was developed by adapting the simple operation principle of solidphase extraction, which made it possible to handle multiple samples simultaneously. The tool was also capable of concentrating different GI and GII genotypes, although the viral recoveries showed variation due to their subtle differences in sequence and structure. The compatibility of the tool with PCR was demonstrated by 15 min concentration and detection of HuNoV from contaminated food samples (200 mL) using qRT-PCR.
