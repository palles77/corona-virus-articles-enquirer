The PRNT 50 end point was considered confirmation of positivity by rELISA because this end point was found to be most sensitive and still specific during investigations of antibody responses in reverse transcription PCR-confirmed MERS-CoV-positive samples from patients in South Korea (14) . (Figure 1) . The 2 samples positive by PRNT were from a woman (26 years of age) and a man (58 years of age) from Tana River County. The woman kept goats, sheep, cattle, and donkeys; the man kept goats and donkeys. Both persons had low antibody titers, and neither reported any recent clinical symptoms, indicating that their MERS-CoV infections probably occurred well before the time of sampling and that the infections may have been mild or subclinical. Because data about persistence of MERS-CoV antibodies after asymptomatic infection are not available, it can only be speculated when and where these infections were acquired. Neither the 2 MERS-CoV antibody-positive persons nor most of the other tested persons owned dromedaries. Nevertheless, camels roam in both counties (7), and humans have regular contact with camels and are likely to consume camel products.",

Our study provides evidence for unrecorded human MERS-CoV infections in Kenya. The proportion of seropositive specimens that we found is comparable to previously reported proportions of unrecorded infections in the general population in Saudia Arabia (1.52% vs. 1.43% positivity by rELISA and 0.15% vs. 0.18% positivity by PRNT for Kenya vs. Saudi Arabia, respectively) (6). Because of an apparently low infection rate and a bias toward reporting severe cases, the discovery of unreported MERS cases requires testing of large sample sizes with well-validated serologic methods (6) . Although the number of samples we tested was approximately only one tenth of the number of samples tested during the Saudi Arabia study, the proportion of seropositive specimens may be similar in Kenya and Saudi Arabia. The lack of a well-developed public health system in parts of Africa could lead to underdiagnosis of clinical cases and would therefore prevent case notification. Moreover, less accessible hospital care might preclude large nosocomial outbreaks as have been observed in countries on the Arabian Peninsula and in South Korea. Other possible explanations for the absence of confirmed and reported clinical cases of MERS-CoV infection in Africa include lesser virulence of strains from Africa and cultural differences that might cause persons of different age ranges to be exposed to the virus.",

It is paramount to characterize MERS-CoVs from humans, camels, or tentative other animal hosts in Africa. For increased understanding of any possible differences in pathogenicity and transmission potential, these MERS-CoV strains should be compared with isolates from the Middle East. Sample no. 976 showed >50% plaque reduction up to a titer of 1:20, and sample no. 126 showed >90% plaque reduction up to a titer of 1:40. No serum was added to the control wells. Note that the image cannot represent the morphology and the contrast of plaques that was visible with direct inspection of cell culture plates with an appropriate light source, as was done for these experiments.",
