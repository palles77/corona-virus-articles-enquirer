This paper investigated changes in HKIA's passenger network for the period of 2001e2012 and used the gravity model to examine the key factors explaining its passenger traffic flows. The findings suggested that HKIA's passenger network has changed significantly and expanded to many new different destinations. Two regions (East Asia and Southeast Asia) were the most important markets for HKIA, and most key destinations connected by Hong Kong showed healthy growth. Nine factors could explain passenger traffic flows between Hong Kong and its key destinations: Hong Kong GDP per capita, GDP per capita of destinations connected by HKIA, distance, airport hub status of the destination airport, tourist destinations connected by HKIA, numbers of passenger airlines in service, bilateral trade flows, speaking a common language and having strong cultural/colonial links with Hong Kong, and the route presence of Cathay Pacific.",

Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has maintained steady growth since its opening in July 1998, except for the periods covering the Asian economic crisis, the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States (US), the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and the global economic downturn (McKercher and Hui, 2004; Sadi and Henderson, 2000; Siu and Wong, 2004; Tsui et al., 2014; Tsui and Fung, 2015) . These exogenous shocks caused significant declines in passenger traffic travelling through HKIA. In addition, HKIA faces fierce competition from nearby airports in the region, including sub-national competition from the other A5 Group airports in the Pearl-River Delta (PRD) Region, 1 national competition from three major Chinese international hub airports (Beijing, Shanghai/Pudong, and Guangzhou Airports), and regional competition from the major Asian international gateway hub airports (Bangkok, Seoul/Incheon, Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo/Narita, Singapore, and Taipei/Taoyuan Airports) (Williams, 2006; Zhang, 2003; Zhang et al., 2004) .",

The decline suggests that HKIA's flight network has expanded to new destinations recently, as HKIA's passenger throughput also maintained healthy growth during the study period. Again, this indicates that the relative importance of the top 45 routes towards the growth of HKIA's passenger throughput is diminishing. With regard to the total passenger numbers of HKIA's top 45 routes, there was a 74% increase during the study period, equalling approximately 6% growth per annum.

In this region, Taipei/Taoyuan was the busiest route for HKIA over the years but showed a decline after 2005: passenger numbers fell from 6.56 million in 2005 to 6.06 million in 2012. This was as the result of the establishment of direct air links across the Taiwan Straits (Chang et al., 2011; Lau et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2004; Tsui and Fung, 2015) . In addition, HKIA's connectivity to the two key Chinese hubs (Shanghai/Pudong and Beijing) remained robust. Shanghai/Pudong became the second busiest route for HKIA after 2005, but showed a 6% fall in passenger numbers between 2010 and 2012 due to the competition of Shanghai/Hongiao. Another key Chinese hub airport (Guangzhou) exited the top 45 list in 2012. Fewer Chinese cities appear in the liste12 in 2001 and decreasing to seven Chinese routes in 2012.",

            "text": "HKG's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita: this represents Hong Kong's domestic economic activity. There is a strong mutual relationship between GDP per capita and the level of air passenger demand of an airport. More importantly, it is also considered to be the best variable to explain this particular relationship (Cline et al., 1998; Doganis, 2002; Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, 2013; Matsumoto, 2004 Matsumoto, , 2007 Tsui et al., 2014) . GDP per capita of the destination: this denotes GDP per capita of a city or destination connected to Hong Kong in which an airport is located. Distance: this represents the Great Circle distance between Hong Kong and a city or destination. In distance decay theory, the distance between two cities should have an inverse relationship with air passenger numbers between them (Matsumoto, 2004 (Matsumoto, , 2007 McKercher and Lew, 2003; Piermartini and Rousov a, 2008; Zhang and Findlay, 2014; Zhang and Zhen, 2013) . Fuel prices: fuel prices affect air travel demand as air travellers appear to be very sensitive to increasing airfares. In general, fuel prices are negatively linked to air traffic flows, suggesting that higher aviation fuel prices would lead to higher airfare levels and have a negative impact on air traffic volumes (Tsui et al., 2014; Zhang and Zhen, 2013) . Airport hub status of the destination: this dummy variable takes the value of 1 when an airport that connects to Hong Kong is an international hub airport, or it is a city that is a political centre or a major commercial city; 0 otherwise. An international hub airport can capture and transport larger amounts of airport traffic, as it possesses size and strategic location advantages; likewise, a political centre or a major commercial centre of an economy may also generate and concentrate a high level of air passenger travel with its strong political, economic and social status (Fung et al., 2008; Gillen and Lall, 1997; Williams, 2006; Zhang and Findlay, 2014) . Tourist city: tourism has a close relationship with the aviation industry. This dummy variable takes the value of 1 when a city connected to Hong Kong is a tourist destination, which may attract a significant amount of leisure travellers, and 0 otherwise (Chi-Lok and Zhang, 2009 ). Numbers of passenger airlines in service: 6 if there are more passenger airlines providing scheduled flight services at an airport, to a large extent, this may lead to higher airport passenger throughput due to the airport's extensive flight network and connectivity to different destinations. Low-cost carriers in operation: Low-cost carriers (LCCs) can attract and transport a significant amount of leisure travellers (price-sensitive travellers) across borders, and they have been a major driver for the growth of airport demand in different countries worldwide (Barrett, 2004; Homsombat et al., 2011; Zhang and Findlay, 2014; Zhang and Zhen, 2013) . Therefore, the effect of LCCs upon passenger traffic flows between Hong Kong and its main destinations was considered in this study. This dummy variable takes the value of 1 when LCCs provide nofrills services to and from Hong Kong, and 0 otherwise. Bilateral trade flows: it is difficult to gather information on bilateral trade in goods between Hong Kong and its key trading markets by means of air transport. Therefore, air cargo volumes are used as the proxy to represent bilateral trade flows between Hong Kong and its trading partners.

This finding supports the notion of the distance decay theory in the gravity model (Grosso and Shepherd, 2011; Matsumoto, 2004 Matsumoto, , 2007 McKercher and Lew, 2003; Piermartini and Rousov a, 2008; Zhang and Findlay, 2014) , which claims that increasing bilateral travel distance between two destinations should have an inverse relationship with air passenger traffic and/or international travel flows. Unlike prior literature, the variable 'fuel prices' was not found to have a negative sign in the model and was statistically insignificant, which might suggest that fuel prices was not an important factor that adversely affected HKIA's passenger traffic flows during the analysis period, while compared to the fuel price surge in 2008. 7 Furthermore, the variable 'travel visa' was reported to have a negative but statistically insignificant coefficient in affecting HKIA's passenger traffic flows. To a certain extent, this finding was in line with prior studies (Neumayer, 2010 (Neumayer, , 2011 Prideaux, 2005) , which suggested that when governments impose travel visas and/or permits (acting as a travel barrier) for travelling by air for Hong Kong citizens and foreign nationals, this may jeopardise Hong Kong's outbound and inbound tourism. Importantly, this particular situation pinpoints that continuous efforts are required from the Hong Kong government and policy makers to negotiate and increase numbers of visa-free entry agreements with foreign countries/territories. 8 The ease or removal of visa control is believed to promote international tourism demand and flows between Hong Kong and its key tourist market sources (Han et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2010; Whyte, 2008) . For example, the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) between Hong Kong and cities in Guangdong (Mainland China) was initially signed in July 2003. This scheme seeks to simplify travel application for Chinese citizens visiting Hong Kong independently. Within the current 49 approved Chinese IVS cities, there are around 270 million Chinese residents who can apply for permission to travel to Hong Kong (Hong Kong Tourism Commission, 2014) . Also, the total number of IVS visitors by air transport to Hong Kong increased from 0.92 million to 1.3 million between 2010 and 2012 (Hong Kong Tourism Board, 2012b).",

The coefficient suggested that if an airport connected by Hong Kong was an international aviation hub, or a political or commercial centre, passenger numbers would be increased by 72% on average. Also, as expected, the variable 'tourist city' was found to be another significant factor in explaining HKIA's passenger traffic flows, implying that more leisure travellers flew between Hong Kong and tourist destinations during the study period. For example, the popular tourist destinations of Denpasar, Phuket, and Taichung recorded 1.02%, 1.01%, and 1.50% of HKIA's total passenger volumes in 2012, respectively. On average, the tourist destinations or cities served by Hong Kong would lead to an increase in HKIA's passenger traffic volumes of 20%. It is worth noting that an increasing level of airport passenger demand or a rapid expansion of tourism (leisure travel) might be associated with both higher income levels and lower air transport costs (Chi-Lok and Zhang, 2009; Profillidis, 2000; Tsui et al., 2014) .",

For example, the routes of Bangkok-Hong Kong and Singapore-Hong Kong had more than ten and six scheduled airlines in service, respectively, and both routes were often ranked among the top six of HKIA's top 45 routes across the study years (see Table 1 ). In general, if more airlines serve a particular route, this may improve flight frequencies and offer more airline choices to air travellers and generate more seats, which may also reduce airfares and thus stimulate air travel demand for that city-pair. Additionally, the variable 'low-cost carriers in operation' was reported to be statistically insignificant, but was in line with Zhang and Findlay (2014) , suggesting that LCCs did not have a significant impact on passenger traffic volumes between Hong Kong and its top 45 destinations during the study period. This is mainly due to LCC operations having only a small market share of HKIA's top 45 routes. 9 LCCs operating to and from Hong Kong just transported approximately 0.36 million (2002) and 3.51 million (2012) of air travellers between Hong Kong and its key Southeast Asian destinations such as Bangkok, Cebu, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. However, their potential impact on Hong Kong airport's passenger traffic volumes and tourism sector (particularly that of price-sensitive tourists) should not be underestimated, particularly given the recent fast-paced growth of LCCs in the Hong Kong tourist market (in particular, Hong Kong Express Airways relaunched itself as a Hong Kong-based LCC in late 2013) and around the Asia-Pacific region, together with more Asian LCCs (e.g. AirAsia, Jeju Air, Jetstar Asia, Jin Air, Spring Airlines, and Tiger Airways) offering international services between Hong Kong and Asian destinations, as well as their ability to affect airfares charged by incumbent airlines (Fu et al., 2015; Zhang and Zhen, 2013) . This could be important: the share of LCCs in HKIA's passenger throughput has risen from 0.03% in 2001 to 6.31% in 2012 (Airport Authority Hong Kong, 2013) .",

The variable 'language and cultural/colonial links' was also found to be a statistically significant factor at the 0.01 significance level that affected HKIA's passenger traffic flows. The coefficient implies that, on average, speaking a common language and having strong cultural and colonial links with Hong Kong (specifically Mainland China and the United Kingdom (UK)) 11 stimulated the growth in HKIA's passenger numbers. Note that there are millions of Chinese and UK visitors flying to and from Hong Kong every year for visiting family and relatives (VFR) and for work and business purposes (Endo, 2007; Hwang and Shiao, 2011; Khadaroo and Seetanah, 2008; Piermartini and Rousov a, 2008; Zhang and Findlay, 2014; Tsui and Fung, 2015) .

It should be noted that Cathay Pacific dominated 23 routes among HKIA's top 45 routes in 2012 and took at least a 29% of HKIA's passenger throughput between 2001 and 2012 (see Section 2.1).",

HKIA's top 45 routes took at least 85% of HKIA's total passenger traffic, but showed a declining trend during the study period. The passenger flight network of HKIA has changed significantly, and has rapidly expanded to many new destinations worldwide. East Asia and Southeast Asia were the two most important regions for HKIA, having at least 31% and 22% of HKIA's passenger throughput over the years. The top three busiest destinations of HKIA were Taipei/Taoyuan, Shanghai/Pudong, and Singapore during the study period. As of 2012, most destinations connected to HKIA showed growth, with the exceptions of Auckland, Delhi, Guangzhou, Johannesburg, London/Heathrow, Mumbai, Tokyo/Narita, Shanghai/Pudong, and Taipei/Taoyuan. dominance by Hong Kong-based carriers is extremely important for HKIA in maintaining its status as one of the key aviation hubs in the Asia-Pacific region and the primary passenger gateway to Mainland China. However, four trunk routes (Bangkok, Dubai, Seoul/Incheon, and Singapore) have never been controlled by Hong Kong-based carriers. Among the four Hong Kong-based carriers, Cathay Pacific has played the most important role in supporting the growth of HKIA's passenger throughput, with at least 30% of HKIA's total passenger traffic the years, followed by Dragonair (8%). As of 2012, the importance of two smaller local airlines (Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express Airways) has been noticeable. Nine significant factors were found to account for HKIA's passenger traffic flows: (1) the increase in GDP per capita of Hong Kong had a positive impact; (2) GDP per capita of a destination connected to Hong Kong also had a positive impact; (3) longer travel distance between Hong Kong and a destination had a negative impact on HKIA's passenger numbers; (4) an airport or a city connected by Hong Kong is an international hub airport or a major political/ commercial centre is likely to generate more passenger traffic; (5) a tourist city or destination connected by Hong Kong is likely to generate more leisure travellers passing through HKIA; (6) more passenger airlines offering scheduled flight services at HKIA are likely to increase air passenger traffic via Hong Kong; (7) bilateral trade flows undertaken between Hong Kong and its key trading markets will generate more international business travel; (8) speaking a common language and having strong cultural/colonial links with Hong Kong (Mainland China and the UK) might strongly relate to a significant amount of vacation and VFR travellers passing through HKIA; and (9) the presence of Cathay Pacific among HKIA's top 45 routes will have a significant impact on HKIA's passenger traffic flows.",

            "text": "To our best knowledge, this is the first empirical study to investigate HKIA's passenger traffic flows (using direct connectivity available at HKIA) based on detailed passenger numbers from HKIA's top 45 routes. More importantly, this study also made two significant contributions to the literature on HKIA. Firstly, the findings of this study help shed some light on the commonly held belief that the hub dominance by Cathay Pacific (along with its subsidiary -Dragonair) has a significant impact on the growth of HKIA's passenger throughput. The analysis and evaluation of Cathay Pacific's contribution towards HKIA's passenger throughput allow us to understand whether Hong Kong may maintain itself as one of the leading aviation hubs in the AsiaePacific region and the primary gateway to Mainland China. In practice, it highlights that more vigilant efforts need to be undertaken by the Hong Kong government and policy makers to protect the economic benefits and financial viability of the Hong Kong-based carriers when negotiating aviation policies (e.g. bilateral air service agreements) and air access with foreign countries, particularly when dealing with more liberalised aviation regimes in the AsiaePacific region. Secondly, the study highlighted the increasing presence of LCCs in the Hong Kong's aviation market and, more importantly, suggested that their aggressive expansion plans will seriously affect the prospects of Hong Kong-based carriers. Looking at this critical issue for Hong Kong's aviation industry, further research could look at the likely effect of LCCs upon the future operations and performance of Hong Kong-based carriers (e.g. their ability to compete with LCCs on a particular route in areas such as airfares) and their impact on HKIA's future growth.",

            "text": "Regarding the limitations of this study, it should be noted that only annual observations of passenger traffic flows between HKIA and its top destinations were analysed. As an extension of this study, it may be meaningful to include more periods of data (e.g. the monthly passenger traffic flows when available) that may allow better understanding of the significant factors to affect HKIA's passenger traffic flows with the dynamic panel data model. In addition, the changes in indirect connectivity (onward connections from HKIA's direct destinations) and hub connectivity via HKIA have not been investigated in detail to show its entire flight network structure. A clear understanding of the growth rates of direct, indirect, and hub connectivity of HKIA may enhance our understanding of whether HKIA is still considered the main transfer airport in the Asia-Pacific region for international visitors (especially China's international inbound and outbound travellers). For example, many Chinese outbound tourists will take advantage of HKIA's extensive flight networks and choose Hong Kong as a stopover to travel to their overseas destinations (e.g. Phuket). With increasing amounts of outbound Chinese tourists, it is imperative to examine its impact on HKIA's passenger throughput growth in future research.",

The effects of global strategic airline alliance activities (e.g. Cathay Pacific is the member of Star Alliance) upon HKIA's passenger network and traffic flows were not discussed in this study. This issue is meaningful for future investigations as global strategic airline alliance networks will bring different types of international passenger traffic via HKIA to their destinations. Furthermore, the reasons why passenger numbers for Dubai and London/Heathrow declined were not explained. In other words, the study has not considered the effect of airport competition upon HKIA's passenger traffic volumes as HKIA always faces intense competition from other key international hubs in Asia and the Middle East to handle transfer traffic in the same catchment area. A route-based analysis for HKIA's trunk routes would be meaningful to understand the causes of variations in passenger traffic volumes.",
