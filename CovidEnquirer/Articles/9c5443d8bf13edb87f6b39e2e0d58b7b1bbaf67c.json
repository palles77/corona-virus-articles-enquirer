In this study, MF59 formulated with a C-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (YW002) was tested for its Th1 adjuvant activity to induce immune responses to HSP65-MUC1, a recombinant fusion protein incorporating a mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP65) and mucin 1, cell surface associated (MUC1) derived peptide. Combination of YW002 with MF59 (MF59-YW002) could confer a potent Th1 biasing property to the adjuvant, which enhanced the immunogenicity of HSP65-MUC1 to induce significantly higher levels of specific IgG2c, increased IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in splenocytes and the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in mice. When prophylactically applied, MF59-YW002 adjuvant containing HSP65-MUC1 inhibited the growth of MUC1 + B16 melanoma and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. In contrast, adjuvant containing MF59 with HSP65-MUC1 in the absence of YW002, promoted the growth of MUC1 + B16 melanoma in mice. These results suggest that MF59 plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotide might be developed as an efficient adjuvant for tumor vaccines against melanoma, and possibly other tumors.",

However, as \"self molecules\", tumor antigens in cancer vaccines are poorly immunogenic and therefore require the use of adjuvant to enhance their ability to elicit strong cellular immune responses. In general, an adjuvant serves to enhance the magnitude, breadth, quality and longevity of specific immune responses to antigens, and is composed of a vehicle and immune-stimulant [2] . The vehicle, such as mineral salts, emulsions and liposomes, functions to control the release and delivery of antigens. In the last decade, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) have been identified as innate immune stimulators, capable of activating antigen presenting cells, especially dendritic cells (DC) to process and present antigens, produce cytokines and chemokines, and up-regulate co-stimulatory molecules more efficiently. This has allowed the combination of PAMPs or their mimics with vehicle compounds such as emulsions to develop efficient adjuvants.",

MF59 is prepared with 4.3% w/w of squalene as an oil phase. Squalene, a biodegradable oil, is extracted from shark liver and occurs in higher organisms including humans as an intermediate in the cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis pathway [6] . In addition to its emulsion properties, MF59 enhances antigen uptake by activating DCs and facilitates Th2-biased immune responses to antigen [7] . Currently, MF59 is being evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials as an adjuvant for microbial antigens from hepatitis B virus (HBV) [8] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [9] , cytomegalovirus (CMV) [10] , human papillomavirus (HPV) [11] , SARS coronavirus [12] , serogroup B meningococcus [13] , human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) [14] and herpes simplex virus [15] .

            "text": "Recently, CpG ODNs have been investigated as adjuvants for tumor vaccines due to their ability to induce and enhance both innate and adaptive immune responses, and consequently are being evaluated in clinical trials [18] [19] [20] . Based on functional characteristics, CpG ODNs are divided into A, B and C subtypes. A-type CpG ODNs induce plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) to secrete large amounts of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1). B-type CpG ODNs stimulate the proliferation and antibody production of B cells. C-type CpG ODNs share properties of A-type and B-type CpG ODNs [21] . In clinical trials, CpG ODNs, especially B-type CpG ODNs, have been evaluated for their efficacy as adjuvants in cancer vaccines [22] . In melanoma patients, CpG 7909, a B-type CpG ODN, formulated with incomplete Freund's adjuvant and melanoma antigen A, induced a vigorous cellular immune response that generated high numbers of melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [23] . CpG 7909 mixed with synthetic NY-ESO-1 peptide and incomplete Freund's adjuvant led to the early induction of specific integrated CD4 + Th cells and the development of NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific CD8 + immune responses in nine patients with NY-ESO-1 expressing tumors. Six of the nine patients survived for an average of 39 months, significantly longer than their predicted survival of 4 months [24, 25] . In addition, vaccination with peptide epitopes LY6K-177 and TTK-567 derived from novel cancer-testis antigens in combination with CpG 7909 successfully elicited antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses and enhanced innate immunity of patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [26] .",

After preparation and identification by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and western blotting (Fig. 1B) , HSP65-MUC1 alone, MF59/HSP65-MUC1, or combination of MF59 with a C-type CpG ODN (YW002) termed MF59-YW002/HSP65-MUC1 was subcutaneously (s.c.) immunized into C57BL/6 mice (n = 10) on both sides of the inguinal lymph node area four times in a 7 day interval ( Fig. 2A) . On day 3 after the last immunization, MUC1 + B16 melanoma cells (1.2 \u00d7 10 5 per mouse) were inoculated into mice (Fig. 1C) . The tumor volumes of mice were measured every other day and survival of the mice was calculated. The results showed that MF59-YW002 could significantly boost the immunogenicity of HSP65-MUC1 to induce anti-MUC1 + melanoma immunity (p = 0.007 compared with the PBS group). Vaccination of HSP65-MUC1 alone displayed a very limited role in inhibiting tumor growth. Using either MF59 or YW002 alone as an adjuvant for HSP65-MUC1 failed to inhibit tumor growth. Surprisingly, when MF59 was used as the sole adjuvant with HSP65-MUC1 it promoted significant growth of MUC1 + B16 melanoma (p = 0.038) (Fig. 2B) . Importantly, mice vaccinated with MF59-YW002/HSP65-MUC1 had a significantly prolonged survival rate, and on day 75 post-tumor challenge, 50% of vaccinated mice were alive. In contrast, only 11.1%, 20% and 20% of the mice survived in the PBS, HSP65-MUC1 alone or YW002/HSP65-MUC1 groups, respectively. In the group vaccinated with MF59/HSP65-MUC1, all mice died at an early stage (Fig. 2C) , consistent with the fast tumor growth. Tumor incidence was the highest (100%) in this group, compared with the PBS, HSP65-MUC1 alone or YW002/HSP65-MUC1 groups, where tumor incidence was 88.9%, 60% or 70%, respectively. In comparison, vaccination with MF59-YW002/HSP65-MUC1 significantly decreased tumor incidence to 30% (Fig. 2D) . Taken together, MF59-CpG ODN may be a promising adjuvant to promote immunogenicity of HSP65-MUC1 to prophylactically inhibit MUC1 + tumors.",

Comparatively, adjuvant containing MF59 alone with HSP-MUC1 failed to induce protective immune responses in mice transplanted with MUC1-expressing melanoma cells. As reported, MF59 has been used as an adjuvant for microbial antigens, such as inactivated influenza virus or herpes simplex virus [31, 32] , to induce neutralizing antibodies against the viruses, with elevated serum Th2 cytokine levels including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 [32] . The inability of MF59/HSP65-MUC1 to induce efficient immunity against MUC1 + tumors could be attributed to its Th2 immune response-biasing properties. Consistent with this, we showed that MF59/HSP65-MUC1 induced significantly elevated levels of HSP65-MUC1-specific IgG1, resulting in a lower IgG2c/IgG1 ratio. It has been shown that MF59 induces Th2 cells to secrete Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10) that can induce isotype switching in B cells to produce IgG1 antibodies [31, 32] .",

However, it is not considered a suitable adjuvant for tumor antigens to induce protective Th1 cellular immune responses against tumor cells. Furthermore, the unsuitability of MF59 for protective immune responses against cancer is demonstrated by the data from this study where immunization with MF59/HSP65-MUC1 promoted the growth of MUC1 + B16 melanoma. This phenomenon may arise from tumor growth promotion caused by Th2 immune responses and antibody mediated tumor invasion.

Thus, the presence of Th2 cytokines would be unfavorable for beneficial Th1-mediated tumor responses. Indeed, Lewis lung carcinoma cells grew more aggressively in IL-10 transgenic mice where an inefficient APC capacity to induce MHC alloreactivity and impaired CTL responses were observed [35] . Additionally, endogenous IL-4 could up-regulate anti-apoptotic gene expression in fibrosarcoma cells, therefore reducing apoptosis of tumor cells [36] . Thus, in a Th2 cytokine milieu, tumor antigen-induced specific antibodies could promote tumor growth. This may be supported by our observation that MF59/HSP65-MUC1 promoted B16 melanoma growth, possibly due to the specific antibodies induced by HSP65-MUC1 under Th2-baised settings created by MF59. This may be partly confirmed by the evidence that antisera or purified IgG derived from recombinant GRP78 (a tumor antigen expressed on melanoma cells)-immunized mice promoted the proliferation of murine melanoma cells in vitro, and that the antibody could cause accelerated B16F1 melanoma growth in GRP78-immunized mice [37] .

            "text": "Currently, B-type CpG ODNs are commonly used as adjuvants for tumor antigens in preclinical studies and clinical trials. In the present study, YW002, a C-type CpG ODN, when formulated with MF59, could enhance HSP65-MUC1-specific Th1-baised immune responses in mice, although the mechanism involved is unclear. However, the 7 . Immunological memory is induced by immunization with MF59-YW002/ HSP65-MUC1 in mice. Mice (n = 5) from the group receiving prophylactic immunization with MF59-YW002/HSP65-MUC1 followed by transfer of MUC1 + B16 melanoma cells were rechallenged sub-cutaneously (s.c.) with 1.2 \u00d7 10 5 MUC1 + B16 melanoma cells. Na\u00efve mice (n = 5) were inoculated s.c. with 1.2 \u00d7 10 5 MUC1 + B16 melanoma cells as controls. Survival of mice was recorded after re-challenge. *p b 0.05 compared with na\u00efve mice. combination of YW002 and MF59 might aid cross-presentation of exogenous HSP65-MUC1 by B cells to generate MUC1-specific CTLs. As reported, upon CpG ODN stimulation, na\u00efve B cells could acquire the ability to present soluble antigens through MHC class I pathway to generate CD8 + T cells [39, 40] . As shown in the present study, HSP65-MUC1 combined with MF59-YW002 induced MUC1 + -specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. Second, the combination of YW002 and MF59 may induce HSP65-MUC1-specific Th1-biased immune responses against MUC1 + B16 melanoma by inducing high levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 from pDCs. In addition, CpG ODN induced IFN-\u03b1 could stimulate DCs to produce IL-12 and CD4 + T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3, consequently promoting the differentiation of Th1 cells [41, 42] . Similarly, our data demonstrated that MF59-YW002/HSP65-MUC1 induced high levels of antigen-specific IgG2c in mice and up-regulated the expression of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in murine splenocytes in vitro. Noticeably, YW002 requires MF59 to induce a Th1-type adjuvant activity for HSP65-MUC1 as HSP65-MUC1 combined with YW002 alone was insufficient to inhibit MUC1 + B16 melanoma growth in mice. This may be explained by the promotion of DC maturation and antigen uptake by MF59, enhancing DC migration to lymph nodes [43] , and providing a potent synergy with YW002 to induce cell-mediated immune responses more effectively. Overall, C-type CpG ODN might be more suitable to work with MF59 on inducing Th1-biased immune response to HSP65-MUC1. The assumption could be supported by our unpublished data that YW002, when formulated with MF59, facilitated HSP65-MUC1 to induce higher level of specific IgG2c and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in mice than 2216, an A-type CpG ODN [44] or 2006, a Btype CpG ODN [45] .",
