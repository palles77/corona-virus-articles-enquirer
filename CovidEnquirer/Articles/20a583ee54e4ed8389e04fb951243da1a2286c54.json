These features are related to herd immunity, quality-of-life losses in young children, parental care and work loss, time preference, uncertainty, eradication, macroeconomics, and tiered pricing. Advisory committees on public funding for vaccines, or for pharmaceuticals in general, should be knowledgable about these special features. We discuss key issues and diffi culties in decision making for vaccines against rotavirus, human papillomavirus, varicella-zoster virus, infl uenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We argue that guidelines for economic evaluation should be reconsidered generally to recommend (1) modelling options for the assessment of interventions against infectious diseases; (2) a wider perspective to account for impacts on third parties, if relevant; (3) a wider scope of costs than health-care system costs alone, if appropriate; and (4) alternative discounting techniques to explore social time preference over long periods.",

Such routine drug assessment processes consider evidence on quality, safety, effi cacy, and cost-eff ectiveness. Because of the increase in the number of diff erent vaccines available and advances in the science behind decision making, we have drawn on existing literature and practices to develop the arguments around potential disparities with other pharmaceuticals when assessing vaccines for public funding. These arguments revolve around vaccine-specifi c features of herd immunity and eradication, which are not evident in pharmaceuticals, and features for which the eff ects of quality-of-life losses in very young children, parental care and work loss, time preference, macroeconomics, and uncertainty substantially infl uence cost-eff ectiveness estimates. Vaccines may increasingly be judged as unacceptable if these features are not acknowledged. We also illustrate these points for fi ve specifi c vaccines that are currently under consideration for widespread use in high-income countries. We use the term \"cost-eff ectiveness\" in a broad sense throughout this article, encompassing cost-utility and cost-benefi t analysis, although there are technical diff erences. 1 ",

The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefi ts Advisory Committee is a rigorous and well-run system for evaluating drugs for acute care, chronic disease, palliation, and more recently vaccines. Many other countries have adopted a similar philosophy towards cost-eff ectiveness considerations for funding pharmaceuticals (eg, Belgium, Finland, Norway, Canada [Ontario] , Portugal, Sweden, Netherlands, UK, and USA [some organisations]), but they deal with preventive public-health measures, such as mass vaccination, in diff erent ways. Some countries have specifi c advisory groups to make funding recommendations on vaccinations (eg, UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices). Often, cost-eff ectiveness evidence for vaccines is assessed in the same manner as for any drug. Nevertheless, as we discuss below, vaccination has special features that make it particularly challenging to assess. Furthermore, vaccination constitutes one of the largest preventive health programmes around the world, and increasing pressures on health-care budgets are as much a challenge for the use of vaccines as for other drugs.",

In fact, the clinical endpoints might not show clinical effi cacy at the time of trial reporting because the numbers required can be extremely large. Clinical endpoints of mortality or hospital admissions might require follow-up of thousands to millions of participants over as long as several decades. As such, some vaccines have been funded on the basis of immunogenicity data or intermediate endpoints alone (eg, meningococcal C conjugate vaccine 4 and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccine in several countries). 5, 6 Vaccination not only protects vaccine recipients, but reduces exposure of unvaccinated people to infection through herd immunity. 7 Herd immunity, in addition to lowering the incidence of infection in the unvaccinated, is well known to lead to an increased average age at infection. 7 Vaccination is therefore not always entirely benefi cial to public health because some childhood infections are more severe if contracted in adolescence or adulthood. Furthermore, vaccination itself may modify vaccine eff ectiveness over time because of factors such as strain replacement and cross reactivity. Some of these indirect eff ects improve the cost-eff ectiveness (eg, non-exposure of most of the unvaccinated, cross reactivity), whereas others may reduce the costeff ectiveness (eg, shift in the average age of infection, serotype replacement). For most vaccination programmes, the sum of these eff ects substantially improves cost-eff ectiveness, but sometimes the reverse may be true. 8, 9 Convincing evidence for the extent of herd immunity, and the duration of immunity, may only come from widespread use in another country, not from clinical trials. For example, the population impact of vaccinations against VZV and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the USA are of major interest to other countries. 10 Appropriately parameterised dynamic transmission models could also provide credible estimates of herd-immunity eff ects. Lieu and colleagues 11 were the fi rst to estimate the costeff ectiveness of a vaccine based on dynamic model simulations. 12 Such models, which take into account the above indirect eff ects, are gradually becoming more widespread, but are not yet part of the traditional toolbox of epidemiologists or health economists. All these features add to the uncertainty under which vaccine funding decisions are made, as opposed to those of other drugs.",

The risk perceptions driving this trade-off are distorted as a result of imperfect information. Reductions in vaccine-preventable disease make people believe that their child's risk of disease has decreased. However, their risk is highly dependent on historical and future rates of exposure and vaccination in the rest of the population and can quickly rebound when uptake declines. 13, 14 Therefore, government intervention in the form of subsidies or public funding is required to ensure that vaccine uptake remains high enough to guarantee benefi cial herd immunity. 15 The UK's recent struggle with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine uptake illustrates this point. 16 For other pharmaceuticals, this kind of trade-off is not even conceivable.",

            "text": "Potential global eradication is another feature that sets some vaccines apart. For example, polio has been eliminated in high-income and middle-income countries. The risk of acquiring paralytic polio from the live oral polio vaccine is thus particularly sensitive to public scrutiny. However, replacing the oral vaccine with the risk-free inactivated polio vaccine is far more expensive, and would be judged unacceptable if cost-eff ectiveness were the only criterion under consideration. 17 Nevertheless, until polio is eradicated globally, vaccination must continue or polio will again become endemic, as shown by occasional outbreaks in unvaccinated communities. 18 Although not usually quantifi ed in cost-eff ectiveness analysis, 14, 19 the prospect of eradication and concerns over the public's perception about the entire vaccination programme has led to the replacement of oral vaccine by inactivated vaccine in nearly all highincome countries. 20 Some infections have the capacity to aff ect not only patients and their direct contacts (ie, their family, health-care provider, employer) in terms of economic costs and medical eff ects, but they may also aff ect health-care use, and expectations and behaviour of consumers and investors. For instance, pandemic infl uenza is likely to lead to capacity problems within the health-care system, aff ecting the timely treatment of patients with infl uenza in addition to those with unrelated illnesses. Additionally, it would have a macroeconomic impact that goes beyond lost productivity to employers of sick patients, because virtually everyone-employers, con sumers, and investors-would adapt their intentions under its perceived threat. 21, 22 The latter was also shown in countries aff ected by the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. 23 Finally, affl uent countries pay much higher prices than poorer countries. 24 This system of tiered pricing is not unique to vaccines, but might be most relevant for new vaccines (eg, rotavirus, pneumococcal, and HPV) and medications (eg, highly active antiretroviral therapy) with great lifesaving potential in poor countries. Some economists argue that market prices set for high-income countries need to be much higher to suffi ciently stimulate Personal View innovation through market mechanisms, rather than rely on publicly funded research. 25 Conversely, if a vaccine is added to a low-income country's national programme, it is likely to become cheaper for high-income countries through price discrimination mechanisms. 26 Clearly, decision making becomes more complex if such moral or opportunistic considerations are thought to be important.",

            "text": "There are some methodological aspects to which the cost-eff ectiveness of vaccines is particularly sensitive. First, the defi nition of the analytical viewpoint is crucial. Guidelines for economic evaluation, as used by most advisory committees, generally focus on direct health-care costs and do not consider indirect costs to society (eg, the value of lost productive and leisure time from illness or caregiving). These indirect costs can be very large for infectious diseases that aff ect virtually the entire population, even for generally benign illness. For example, the cost-eff ectiveness of childhood VZV vaccination is unlikely to be thought acceptable from the health-care budget perspective, but is possibly cost-saving from a societal perspective. 8, 11, 27 Second, the use of quality-adjusted life-years is widely advocated as the best measure currently available for valuing health states. However, standardised quality-oflife estimates for short-term diseases in young children are virtually non-existent, and the appropriate methods to measure them are subject to debate. [28] [29] [30] Additionally, the impact of a child's illness on the quality of life of caregivers can be substantial, just as it is for lifethreatening and severe chronic diseases in adults (eg, cancer). 31 However, such indirect quality-of-life losses are typically not accounted for. These impacts have the potential to change decisions, for instance on rotavirus vaccine. 32 Finally, the peace of mind off ered through the reassurance of vaccine protection is a quality-of-life improvement of prevention programmes that is routinely ignored in economic evaluation. 33 A third issue is the impact that discounting has in accounting for time preference. Discounting is a technique that aims to put costs and benefi ts occurring at diff erent timepoints on the same basis of comparison. Discounting scales down future events, such that, the further into the future they occur or the higher the discount rate, the less important they are to a decision maker in the present. In health economics, there is continued debate about whether the discount rate for health outcomes should be lower than or equal to that for costs. 34, 35 For curative therapies, most benefi ts accrue immediately or shortly after the intervention is initiated, and the cost-eff ectiveness of these interventions is therefore largely independent of these methodological disagreements on discounting. Conversely, the costeff ectiveness of most prevention programmes is highly sensitive to discounting because of the long time spans over which benefi ts accrue. A slight decrease in discount rate-eg, from 5% to 3%-could change the costeff ectiveness of vaccination from unacceptable to attractive. Country-specifi c recommend ations on discount rates vary to the extent that a vaccine could be deemed cost eff ective in one country and cost-ineff ective in another for this reason alone (table 1).",

            "text": "In the standard discount procedure, as recommended in all guidelines known to us, the discount rate is constant, implying that preferences between outcomes are held constant through time and depend only on the length of the time interval between them. One can argue that discounting at a constant rate exaggerates the importance we give for the present over the future. [46] [47] [48] This assertion is backed by psychological empirical evidence, which suggests that the diff erence between equidistant outcomes is thought less important the further into the future the outcomes occur. 47 So-called \"slow\" discounting procedures could be used for cases in which the discount rate decreases and falls close to zero for the more distant future (eg, 3\u00b75% for years 0-10, 1\u00b75% for years 11-20, 0% thereafter), thus yielding a higher present value of benefi ts. 49, 50 Additionally, time preference may exist only to the time until risk exposure, and not the time until health consequences from risk exposure arise (eg, cervical cancer is the health consequence of a much earlier exposure to HPV). 51 Adjustment of the discount procedure to account for these aspects is not current practice, but would substantially improve the estimated cost-eff ectiveness of prevention versus cure. 49, 50 Currently, policy makers are presented with very wide cost-eff ectiveness ranges for preventive public-health actions when sensitivity to discounting is illustrated to them. In 1968, Baumol 52 noted the \"sorry spectacle\" that economists provided through their diverging understandings on this subject, and his assertion that \"little help is provided to the decision maker who is confronted with such an enormous range of Finally, the equity impact of vaccination is far less predictable than for most drugs. Generally, the less healthy or less wealthy are those least likely to be vaccinated, and thus more likely to experience the eff ect of herd immunity from other people receiving vaccination. As shown for measles in Bangladesh, 53 this eff ect is often equitable, but the reverse may also occur for poorly executed vaccination programmes. 54 The redistribution eff ects on health and wealth are thus less straightforward in the prediction of decisions on vaccination compared with those used for therapeutic medicines.",

In high-income countries, the main benefi t of rotavirus vaccines is the prevention of parental care and productivity losses in virtually all households with infants or toddlers.

Given the current price setting (\u20ac80-120 per fully vaccinated child) and the recommended schedule for these vaccines (two doses Rotarix [GlaxoSmithKline]; three doses Rotateq [Merck]), they are unlikely to be judged as cost eff ective unless these so-called \"soft\" benefi ts are also included. 32, [56] [57] [58] But if they are, why should they not also be considered for all other health-care interventions, thus potentially reshuffl ing the comparison between all health-care programmes (including the other vaccines discussed here)?

The static models that have been published so far have tended to be favourable. 59, 60, 62 Policy makers could therefore quickly decide about vaccinating a limited number of cohorts before their sexual debut, and have reasonably confi dent cost-eff ectiveness evidence to support this decision.

Since chickenpox infects virtually all children by age 12 years, the accumulated societal savings, including avoided parental care and productivity losses, are likely to be greater than the costs of vaccination at a price of \u20ac15-50 per fully vaccinated person. However, childhood VZV vaccination increases the occurrence of shingles in adults and this may be such that it counteracts these societal savings and leads to adverse health eff ects. 63 A further complication is that with single-dose infant vaccination many teenage breakthrough cases can still be expected, but the addition of a second dose to prevent this would make it a much less cost-eff ective programme. Modifi ed VZV vaccine in adults was recently shown to prevent shingles, and was shown by static models to be cost eff ective. 64, 65 Finally, vaccination of susceptible pre-adolescents is an alternative strategy that has consistently been shown to be cost eff ective to the health-care budget, and is thus independent of the wider societal perspective. 66 However, it is not advocated by public-health specialists, because it would only prevent a small part of all chickenpox disease, albeit the most severe proportion. 8, 11, 27 Clearly, the simultaneous modelling of all these strategies and considerations requires complex models and data from various sources to establish eff ectiveness. Empirical studies alone cannot answer all these questions.",

Therefore, guidelines should also be adapted in general terms to allow for (1) a wider perspective to account for eff ects on third parties, if these are aff ected substantially by specifi c interventions (eg, parents experiencing a quality-of-life impact through the illness of their child); (2) a wider scope of costs to be included, if appropriate, than health-care system costs alone (eg, irrecoverable losses caused by modifi ed behaviour when faced with a large public-health threat); and (3) alternative discounting techniques to deal with social time preference over long time periods.",
