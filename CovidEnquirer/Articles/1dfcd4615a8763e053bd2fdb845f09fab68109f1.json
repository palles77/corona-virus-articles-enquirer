One example is the importance of the free-living survival stage of certain pathogens, and especially is cases where they are transmitted indirectly between hosts through an environmental reservoir intermediate. In this study, we develop an integrated, broadly applicable mathematical method to examine diseases fitting this description-the waterborne, abiotic and other indirectly transmitted (W.A.I.T.) infection framework. To demonstrate its utility, we construct realistic models of two very different epidemic scenarios: cholera in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water and hepatitis C virus in an urban setting of injection-drug users. Using these two exemplars, we find that the W.A.I.T. model fortifies the centrality of reservoir dynamics in the \"sit and wait\" infection strategy, and provides a way to simulate a diverse set of intervention strategies.",

Much of this research has concentrated on fomite, aerosol and airborne-transmitted viruses [10] , [11] , [13] , [14] , [16] , [19] , [22] and waterborne infections [12] , [17] , [23] , [26] , [29] - [33] . Other studies have focused on systems where pathogens are growing in the environment [18] , or have explored indirectly-transmitted infections in theoretical terms [21] , [24] . One framework for studying indirect, environmental transmission-the environmental infection transmission systems (E.I.T.S)-is engineered with explicit constraints that render its application necessarily narrow [15] . We offer that these prior treatments are individual examples of a general phenomenon that would benefit from a mathematical treatment that is both more rigorous and more broadly applicable. This new formalism should accommodate a widerrange of pathogens than have been previously considered and should emphasize how the environment can comprise multiple discrete dynamic entities (not unlike how host populations are often modeled).",

As the WAIT perspective specifically focuses on the peculiar dynamics of environmental compartments, we argue that it is imbued with more features and applies to a broader set of examples than prior treatments. To demonstrate its novelty and range of application, we fully examine its common relevance to two otherwise disparate modern diseases: cholera and hepatitis C virus. The study proceeds in stages: (1) we first introduce a purely theoretical iteration of WAIT using a standard epidemiological model, explaining how to conceptualize an infection in terms of the WAIT framework, and deriving the reproductive number (R 0 ) using analytical methods. (2) We apply the WAIT perspective to a waterborne disease that has been the object of several modeling exercises: the transmission of Vibrio cholerae in a densely populated setting with limited access to clean drinking water. (3) We then apply the WAIT perspective to a completely different, less-explored disease case: an HCV epidemic among injection drug users (IDU) in a modern urban setting. These constitute different epidemics in terms of pathogen type (Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium, HCV a single-stranded RNA virus) and setting. Nonetheless, we conceptualize and model each epidemic scenario, highlighting mathematical features that are unique to the WAIT framework. We discuss how this lens provides new perspective on cholera outbreaks and especially the modern HCV epidemic.",

While this is analogous to prior methods used to discuss indirect or environmental transmission [17] , a full appreciation of both cases discussed in this study (cholera and HCV) would benefit from a full, transparent explanation of the WAIT model-building process. The method is defined by modeling changes in a population of susceptible hosts (\"S\"), infected hosts (\"I\") and recovered (\"R\"). Classically, flow through the system is defined by contact between susceptible and infected individuals, often driven by a \u03b2 factor, or transmission coefficient.",

Figure 3 shows various iterations of the simulation, tracking the sum of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the standard model (Figure 3a) , with various different interventions implemented (3c, 3d). In Figure 3c , we observe how the effect of daily vaccine administration manifests most clearly in the longer term (>100 days) behavior of the dynamics, where it can eventually exceed the effects of reduction in contaminated water consumption (if vaccine effectiveness is sufficiently high). We can also see the large impact of instantaneously reducing contaminated water consumption on the number of infected individuals (in terms of both number of infected individuals, and the rate at which that impact manifests). For example, increasing antibiotic, and vaccine administration two-fold has less immediate impact on disease dynamics than decreasing contaminated water consumption even by a quarter. Together, the cholera WAIT model offers the hypothesis that ideal interventions might include a combination of long-term (e.g. vaccination) and short-term (e.g. water purification) interventions to limit the number of infected cases.",

Needle-exchange programs are an example of \"harm reduction\" public health strategies that aim to reduce harm stemming from behaviors that put the affected individuals or communities at risk [65] . These policies are controversial, but have been demonstrated to be effective interventions for HIV and HCV in certain settings [66] . With respect to the HCV WAIT model, some of these programs (especially ones targeting injection equipment, like safe injection sites) can increase the discard rate of infected needles by providing a safe location to use and discard needles, while also providing uninfected needles to IDU. In our model, parameters like the needle discard rate, k i and k u , and \u03c0 N are affected by needle exchange programs. Figure  6 demonstrates how R 0 is affected by these parameters. One can see that R 0 can be reduced by increasing k i -the infected needle discard rate-along a fixed value of \u03c0 Nthe birthrate of uninfected needles-and that increasing \u03c0 N along a fixed value of k i has the same effect. It is also evident that R 0 can be reduced more rapidly by increasing k i and \u03c0 N simultaneously, as expected. In this way, the proportion of infected needles is reduced because of an increase in clean needles and a reduction of infected ones, lowering R 0 .",

The opposite effect is observed when increasing k u along fixed values of k i . That is, removing infected needles at an increased rate may decrease infection risk in a population of IDU, while doing the opposite can increase the risk. One can also see that increasing k u and k i simultaneously along the dashed linewhere k u = k i -will increase R 0 . This indicates that if a distinction between infected and uninfected needles cannot be established in a given setting, then it may be more helpful to add a higher proportion of uninfected needles than it would be to remove a higher proportion of all needles.",

We use it to explore two very different modern epidemics of significant public health consequence: cholera and hepatitis C virus. We first establish it through a simple form, an elementary adapted SIR formulation, and highlight how it modifies fundamental properties of epidemics such as the basic reproductive number (R 0 ). We then build mathematical models to explore cholera and HCV disease dynamics. We demonstrate how the integrated framework highlights potentially overlooked properties of these systems, and highlights potential avenues for intervention. The model is compatible with existing canon in epidemiology, and can accommodate theory in the ecology and evolution of infectious disease. For example, the \"curse of the pharaoh hypothesis,\" which predicts that pathogens with high free-living survival can be more virulent [78] , can be modeled on a population scale using the WAIT framework. In addition, its careful treatment of environmental dynamics makes it amenable to questions regarding how changes in climate, social policy, or behavior may influence the spread of disease.",
