Similar approaches may lead to improved vaccines against influenza virus and measles virus. For influenza viruses, and now for rabies virus, these negative-strand RNA viruses have been shown to be able to express additional protein sequences or transcriptional units. Thus, these viruses may act as vectors to express foreign proteins, which may broaden their use as vaccines for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. Finally, these transfectant viruses may be useful in gene therapy. Transient expression of genes may be helpful in therapy of, for example, cystic fibrosis or cancer, and targeting cells using an RNA virus may have advantages over that using viruses with a DNA phase.",

            "text": "The Yersinia PTPase domain consists of an eight-stranded p sheet surrounded by seven cc helices that form a prominent substrate-binding cleft'. At the base of the cleft lies a phosphate-binding loop (the P loop) that is composed of amino acids 403-410 (CRAGVGRT). The P loop provides a framework of hydrogen bonds that initially stabilize the negatively charged thiolate of the catalytic Cys403 residue. On binding substrate, the hydrogenbonding array subsequently positions the bound anion for nucleophilic attack by the thiol group. PTPlB and the low-molecular-mass mammalian PTPase have similar active-site clefts and P-loop structures, although their topologies differ significantly outside this central core2,4. The specificity of the PTPase anion-binding and transfer reaction may be controlled by the depth of the substrate-binding cleft, which appears to be inaccessible to the shorter side chains of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine.",

            "text": "A substrate-induced conformational change may be an essential step in the catalysis reaction. By analyzing crystals of the protein complexed with the phosphate analog tungstate, Stuckey et al. l showed that a second loop of amino acids (residues 350-360) shifts towards the catalytic cleft, effectively trapping the bound anion (Fig. 1) . The conserved Asp356, an important catalytic residue, moves approximately 6 A into the active site. This conformational change would place the side chain of the aspartic acid in an ideal position for proton transfer during hydrolysis, assuming that a similar movement occurs when phosphotyrosine binds. In unpublished work, the same conformational change has been observed in crystals of the inactive Cys403+Ser Yersinia PTPase domain complexed with sulfate'. Thus, this movement may prove to be a general mode of PTPase action as the structures of further PTPasesubstrate complexes are resolved. Several observations showing that PTPase substrates are tightly associated with inactive Cys+Ser or Cys+Ala PTPase mutants support the occurrence of this substrateinduced conformational changelo-i2.",

Stuckey et al. l have found that the P-loop motif is conserved in rhodanese, a mitochondrial sulfur transferase (Fig. 2) .

As N. commune is free living, IphP probably evolved directly from prokaryotic ancestry. In addition, a potential target for IphP has been found in N. commune, a rare example of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in a prokaryote. These results raise the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation and its associated enzyme functions arose in evolution before the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As eukaryotic organisms evolved and began to use protein tyrosine phosphorylation as a major mechanism to activate cellular responses in the immune system, microorganisms such as Yersinia seem to have acquired new genetic traits to subvert this process.",
