NiV infection is an emerging zoonosis that is transmissible to humans and is associated with high mortality rates. In this study, explored the application of computational drug repositioning and chemogenomic enrichment analyses using host transcriptome data to match drugs that could reverse the virus-induced gene signature. We performed analyses using two gene signatures: i) A previously published gene signature (n=34), and ii) a gene signature generated using the characteristic direction method (n= 5,533). Our predictive framework suggests that several drugs including FDA approved therapies like beclometasone, trihexyphenidyl, S-propranolol etc. could modulate the NiV infection induced gene signatures in endothelial cells. A target specific analysis of CXCL10 also suggests the potential application of Eldelumab, an investigative therapy for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, as a putative candidate for drug repositioning. To conclude, we also discuss challenges and opportunities in clinical trials (n-of-1 and adaptive trials) for repositioned drugs. Further follow-up studies including biochemical assays and clinical trials are required to identify effective therapies for clinical use. Our proof-of-concept study highlights that translational bioinformatics methods including gene expression analyses and computational drug repositioning could augment epidemiological investigations in the context of an emerging disease with no effective treatment.",

            "text": "Nipah Virus (NiV) is a member of Paramyxoviridae family of enveloped, Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. NiV is a member of Henipavirus genus -other Henipaviruses include Cedar henipavirus, Ghanaian bat henipavirus, Hendra henipavirus and Mojiang henipavirus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . NiV infection is considered as an emerging infectious disease threat by the World Health Organization (WHO) (See: http, //www.who.int/csr/disease/nipah/en/) [10, 11] . NiV infection was first reported and the virus was isolated during an outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore in the late 1990s [12] [13] [14] . NiV infection reemerged in 2018 in Kozhikode, a coastal city in Kerala, India. The Kerala reemergence is associated with high mortality rate (above 80% of identified cases, personal communication) (See: http, //www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44193145). At present there are no approved therapies or vaccines against NiV. In this study, we explore the application of translational bioinformatics databases, tools and methods like computational drug repositioning to predict potential FDA-approved, therapies using publicly available datasets. Follow-up studies, including experimental assays and clinical trials are required before using repositioned candidate drugs for clinical use.",

Notably, vaccine candidates like human monoclonal antibody m102.4 has found to be effective in pre-clinical studies [71] . Pre-clinical immunotherapy studies demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies might be beneficial (anti-G and anti-F MAbs) as agents against NiV infection. Small molecules that activate IRF3 and modulate RIG-I-like receptors pathways [56] were also investigated as potential strategies to target NiV infection [54] .",

If a positive effect of the drug is observed, withdrawal may not be possible on ethical grounds, and washout periods without any treatments may also harm patient safety. Given these scenarios, other forms of singlesubject designs that do not require treatment withdrawal (such as multiple baseline designs), or a baseline phase (such as alternating treatment designs) could be considered.",

HUVEC cells may reflect differential gene expression from an affected tissue in a disease of interest. In the absence of patient derived genomic or transcriptomic data sets, the drug lists are less reliable for human testing without any additional experimental evidences. We have very low sample size and the gene signature may fluctuate to a higher or lower number of genes based on the sample size, statistical tests, and multiple testing correction methods. The sample size does not meet the biological replication criteria of a minimum of three samples. Our drug repositioning algorithms are predictive in nature and do not endorse immediate clinical use without further pre-clinical and clinical studies. Offlabel prescription and recommendations would need additional comparative effectiveness trials for these drugs. Also, as a research study, the list of drugs compiled in the results section needs further evaluation in preclinical validation models and needs to be tested in patient cohorts using different clinical trial modalities including comparative effectiveness trials. Various factors drive the success of statistical validity of the predictive frameworks including availability and quality of data, choice of analytical algorithm, orthogonal evidence, and statistical methods that accounts for a large number of data points. We restrict the results, interpretation and discussions on drugs that are in DrugBank; however, other compounds may have superior anti-NiV activity. These compounds would need All rights reserved.

Specifically, we performed computational drug matching searches to find drugs that can reverse the virus induced gene signature on an endothelial cell line in the setting of NiV infection. Briefly, translational bioinformatics approaches with epidemiology efforts may help to accelerate the discovery of affordable therapeutic options for public health crises including emergence of infectious diseases.

However, clinical trial designs are evolving. Several new clinical trial design methods have been introduced over the last few decades (adaptive trial and n-of-1 trial)[171, 172]. These trials were primarily designed to augment RCT methods to develop evidence for personalized clinical modalities and interventions in the setting of precision medicine. An adaptive trial is a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a medical device or intervention by observing patient outcomes within a pre-defined schedule; the trial could be \"adapted\" to the observations from the intermediate endpoints. For example, given three therapies (A, B, and C) and a placebo (P), an adaptive trial can be designed with two intermediate endpoints (EP1 and EP2) and the end stage of a phase III trial. Therapies that meet EP1 (B and C) will proceed to EP2. If only one therapy is effective at EP2; only this therapy and placebo will proceed to the final phase of the trial. Adaptive trials are currently being evaluated as a trial design for various infectious diseases including HIV and Ebola [173-177].",

Despite their benefits and alignment with personalized medicine approaches, N-of-1s present challenges in the context of NiV infection.

These symptoms often appear as a singular presentation, and present in patients in different combinations; this makes it difficult to capture end points in the continuous fashion required by N-of-1 approaches. Delineating the clinical symptoms as endpoints would be key to developing a trial design strategy. A trial design that can accommodate features like survival analyses with time-to-event as an",

Also, the cell lines are a simplified representation of complex human disease physiology, where many patients could have several comorbidities and perturbed multiple factors including medications, environment, diet etc. These factors are not considered in the context of our study. Further, an ideal gene signature could be derived by comparing transcriptome extracted from whole blood of patients with NiV infection and age, gender-matched controls with no infection [183]. For example, we have performed similar analyses in diseases like peripheral arterial diseases and later used for drug repositioning investigations [106].

Multiple reports on computational, pre-clinical, off-validation, and other mode-ofsuccess for drug repositioning are available in biomedical literature. But there was no comprehensive, integrative analysis of reported repositioned drugs, their indications, repositioned drug targets, or chemical properties of repositioned drugs. Recently, we compiled drug repositioning investigations from literature and other public data repositories and developed, the first comprehensive resource of drug repurposing (See RepurposeDB: A reference database of drug repositioning investigations -http, //repurposedb.dudleylab.org/). By integrating large-scale data on drugs, indication, side effects, and mechanism of actions, the computational drug repositioning process can be automated. Predictive data can be used for prioritizing candidate drugs for downstream studies including biochemical validation and clinical trials. Thus, computational drug repositioning offers a predictive framework for accelerated therapeutic recommendation in scenarios that requires immediate therapeutic stratification [106-114].",

Pathology studies indicate that the endothelium of central nervous system was susceptible to NiV infection and may thus represent a representative model system to study NiV infection using molecular level data [119]. Downregulated genes: n=2869. Eight upregulated genes were shared across both signatures (IFIT1, IFI44L, OASL, CXCL10, IFIT2, OAS2, OAS1, IFI44) and one gene was common across down regulated genes (TAF4B). Both gene lists were used independently to perform drug matching using CGEA approach using a library of drugs were annotated in conjunction with RepurposeDB. In the interpretation step, we primarily focus on the approved subset of compounds to extent the feasibility of launching immediate clinical trials. Briefly the gene set-drug matching data was compiled and annotated using data from the Connectivity Map, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System, PubChem, SIDER, Offsides and Drug Bank. Results compiled from CGEA consist of compound information including chemoinformatics signatures, drug target information, indications, mechanism of action and side effects.

Our current study provides, a hypothesis generating, proof-of-concept study to leverage such molecular profile drug stratification approach as an aid to augment in the setting of a global public health crises, namely infectious diseases. Pharmaceutical companies have limited interest in budgeting drug discovery for niche markets and therapies with limited market value. Computational drug repositioning with modern clinical trial designs offer a comprehensive approach to address such challenges. In this work, we applied open access biomedical data, bioinformatics tools and methods to compile and interpret complex data to prioritize potential targets and recommend therapies for NiV, an emerging infectious disease. While we identified several indications, these drugs are not ready for immediate clinical use for NiV and need further experimental and clinical studies before use. In addition to pharmacological and biochemical annotations based filtering, the drugs can be filtered for approval status, availability, and cost as drug distribution varies across global markets. However, such filtering has not been considered in the study and drugs approved and available in the United States of America may or may not available with an approval in other countries or vice versa. In this study, we have only explored computational drug repositioning; other strategies including target-driven drug discovery is another strategy that may help to find a therapy for NiV infection. Several, well characterized host-pathogen interaction suggests targets including STAT1, Ephrins and ANP32B could be suitable for structure-based drug discovery and need further studies. Designing RNA interference molecules[105, 127]  or peptide drugs to target these interactions may be useful to develop anti-NiV therapies[28, 32,52,78,81,82,84, 89, 97,. rights reserved.
