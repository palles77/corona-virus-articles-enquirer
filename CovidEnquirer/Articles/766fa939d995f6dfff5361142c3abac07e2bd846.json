            "text": "Molecular technology has given us a greater insight into the aetiology of disease, the functioning of the immune system and the mode of action of veterinary pathogens. The knowledge gained has been used to develop new vaccines with specific, reactive antigens which elicit protective immune mediated responses (humoral and/or cell mediated) in the host. These vaccines should not burden the immune system by initiating responses against non-essential antigens. However, the efficacy of these vaccines is only as good as the delivery technology or route used to present them to the immune system. Some vaccines, traditionally given by the parenteral route, are now given by the natural route; either orally or intranasally. Two major advantages, often interrelated, are the rapid onset of immunity and stimulation of the local, mucosal immunity. These new technologies are now making an impact on current vaccine development. The balance has to be found between what is technologically feasible and what will provide at least as good a protective immunity as current, conventional vaccines. As new and emerging diseases appear globally, new opportunities arise for molecular and conventional technologies to be applied to both the development and delivery of novel vaccines, as well as the improvement of vaccines in current use. #",

Although vaccine preparations bear no resemblance to the crude scab homogenates of 200 years ago, his concept of vaccination is still the basis of vaccine development today, i.e. that immunization with attenuated or killed pathogens will elicit protective responses against homologous or closely related (heterologous) pathogens. A better understanding of the immune system has been gained over the last 50 years and this deeper knowledge of innate and acquired immunity is being used for the optimal targeting of vaccines.",

Antibodies produced by plasma cells derived from B cells recognize free antigens (viral, bacterial, para-www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 117 (2006) [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] sitic) in body fluids, and subsequently bind and inactivate them. Viruses with many identical binding sites for antibodies due to their structural symmetry, can form large aggregates when they are bound by immunoglobulins, which are taken up by phagocytes (opsonisation) and destroyed (Levine, 1992) . The function of the vaccine is to aid this process by priming the animal before the pathogen invades, creating memory in the B cells and stimulating cell mediated immunity.",

In some countries where rabies is endemic or a significant threat, vaccination against this disease is also mandatory.

This heterologous, broad protection is an interesting finding as different clades occur from continent to continent, and even within the US, from state to state, so that FIV vaccines need not contain all Clade types but rely on synergistic cross protection of a few.

Vaccines against leishmaniasis usually consist of whole freeze-dried organisms of L. infantum and have varied in their efficacy. A new adjuvanted vaccine is now being trialled, prepared using only antigen proteins excreted by L. infantum. Initial results are promising, demonstrating immunity over a 2-year period in 100% of the vaccinated dogs.

Wildfowl are carriers of this virus, spreading it over considerable distances. Kuiken et al.

Signs in animals vary but virulent strains may cause death within a few days after an incubation period of 3-5 days. (Kuiken et al., 2004) . This situation will have to be closely monitored as society is sensitive to the spread of disease from small animals ever since the source of the SARS outbreak was associated with civets (Tu et al., 2004) .",

The application of molecular technology for the prevention of disease was highlighted in the extensive wild life vaccination programme of 1989-1995 against sylvatic fox rabies in which the use of a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing rabies glycoprotein (VRG vaccine) resulted in many European countries now being rabies free (Pastoret and Brochier, 1999) . Since then much research has been invested into producing safe and efficacious vaccines using this technology in a more economical and efficient way. Safety of vaccines is enhanced as reversion to virulence is no longer a risk and excretion of vaccinal virus post vaccination is eliminated. Vaccines containing sub-unit fractions of pathogens, rather than the whole organism, should also be less immune-stressful to the host as the immune system is only directed against specific antigens and not a spectrum of non-essential cell structures.",

They may be concentrated and purified before being adjuvanted to enhance the immune response.

            "text": "Recombinant vaccines are produced by inserting genes coding for essential immunogens of pathogens into a vector, usually viral, which then are incorporated into the viral genetic code. When the vector is inoculated into the animal, it infects target cells and upon replication, expresses the foreign gene proteins as well as its own. The infected cell then releases these proteins which are detected by the immune system and a humoral and/or cell mediated immune response is initiated. In this way, protective neutralising antibodies are raised against the epitope(s) of the pathogen without the presence of the whole organism. Choice of an appropriate vector is often made by using ones that are not found naturally in the target species. For example, although canine adenoviruses and feline herpesviruses have been shown to be efficient vectors, inoculation into the respective host species may not be viable due to circulating antibodies present through vaccination or disease. Some of the most successful viral vectors for small animals have been found in the poxviruses-Modified Vaccinia Ankora (Drexler et al., 2004) , canarypox (Paoletti, 1996) and myxoma (McCabe et al., 2002) as cats and dogs are not naturally infected by these viruses. DNA vaccines could be described as the purest of vaccines as the animal is not injected with the antigen but with the DNA encoding the antigen. These vaccines can be injected into the muscle or intradermally by needle injection for optimal uptake. The DNA, encoding epitopes or complete antigen, is integrated into a plasmid, along with a promoter which is selected for optimal transcription, yielding high expression levels of the encoded protein. Although these vaccines elicit both cell mediated and humoral immune responses in the target species, the immune responses induced by some DNA vaccines may be lower than those elicited by conventional vaccines (Oyaski and Hildegunds, 2000) . Experimental DNA vaccines have been shown to protect against a variety of diseases but two concerns are the production of sufficient quantities of DNA to make vaccination economical, and transfection efficiency. Immune responses can be enhanced significantly by the use of gene guns and electroporation which increase transfection but these technologies have not yet advanced to the stage of routine use, especially in companion animals which require user-friendly procedures. Gene guns have been available for the past few years but a practical disadvantage is the noise they produce when the gun is triggered and the pressurised gas in the chamber expels the DNA-coated gold particles into the epidermis. This sudden shock could well make the animal nervous on subsequent visits to the veterinary surgery. A second disadvantage is in deciding where to inoculate an animal whose body is covered with fur. A significant amount of work is now being undertaken to improve the efficacy of DNA delivery.",

The DNA of a vaccine virus can be manipulated to delete a specific gene so the animal does not produce antibodies to the coded protein which is present in the pathogen. Differential diagnostic tests (e.g. ELISA) are then developed to detect that particular protein absent in the vaccine. Serum from vaccinated animals would test negative while that from infected animals would test positive. The first vaccine to be used in this way was an Aujeszky disease vaccine for pigs in which both the glycoprotein (gE) and thymidine kinase (TK) genes were deleted in the vaccinal virus (Pasick, 2004) . Presently, vaccine manufacturers are not required by EU directives to differentiate their vaccines from field pathogens before submitting them for registration, but as this may become a reality, sequence analysis, deleted genes and markers are fast becoming routine technology within vaccine R&D laboratories. The use of reverse genetics also enables the manipulation of RNA viruses.",

Convention for many years meant that vaccines were delivered by the subcutaneous (s/c), or in some cases, intramuscular (i/ m) route. For diseases such as parvovirus and distemper, systemic antibody response correlates with protection. Vaccines given by s/c or i/m routes have been shown to produce and maintain significant protective antibody levels for many years which has resulted in major vaccine companies recommending at least bi-annual and tri-annual boosts with certain vaccine components, such as parvovirus, distemper and adenovirus, instead of the annual booster prescribed since vaccination regimes were instigated. However, circulating maternal antibodies in young animals may inhibit the take of certain vaccines when given at a young age. In some instances, as with canine distemper and parvovirus, this can be overcome to a certain degree by increasing the titre of the vaccinal virus (Chalmers and Baxendale, 1994) , otherwise a second or even third vaccination has to be given when the MDA levels have decreased sufficiently to ensure vaccine take.",

The organisms associated with the KC syndrome, namely Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parainfluenza and canine adenovirus, included in mono-, bi-, or tri-valent vaccines, are usually given prior to kennelling when a rapid onset of immunity (OOI) is required, usually within 48-72 h post inoculation. Those which offer a duration of immunity (DOI) of 12 months can then be used to vaccinate dogs in the intermediate years between immunization with the core vaccines (CDV, CPV, CAV2) with a 3-year DOI.

However, the prime objective of any immunisation programme, regardless of the technology, is to protect the animal as quickly as possible and to maintain that immunity for as long as possible, against prevalent disease. Some vaccine companies have addressed these issues and have taken the ethical view on 'over vaccination' by reducing or eliminating non essential antigenic components and achieving DOIs of at least 2 years for the major components. Veterinary vaccines include a wide range of viral and bacterial antigens but it is now time to for parasitic vaccine development to catch up. These vaccines are the most problematic due to their composition, but because of the increasing incidence of exotic parasitic diseases appearing in new regions, it is imperative that these are part of the future vaccine armoury giving a broad protection against new and emerging diseases.",
