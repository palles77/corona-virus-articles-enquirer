A docking study involving binding between the initial lead compound 1 and the SARS-CoV 3CL pro motivated the replacement of a thiazole with a benzothiazole unit as a warhead moiety at the P1 0 site. This modification led to the identification of more potent derivatives, including 2i, 2k, 2m, 2o, and 2p, with IC 50 or K i values in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. In particular, compounds 2i and 2p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activities, with K i values of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively. The peptidomimetic compounds identified through this process are attractive leads for the development of potential therapeutic agents against SARS. The structural requirements of the peptidomimetics with potent inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV 3CL pro may be summarized as follows: (i) the presence of a benzothiazole warhead at the S1 0 -position; (ii) hydrogen bonding capabilities at the cyclic lactam of the S1-site; (iii) appropriate stereochemistry and hydrophobic moiety size at the S2-site and (iv) a unique folding conformation assumed by the phenoxyacetyl moiety at the S4-site.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a typical form of pneumonia, was first reported in southern China in November 2002. SARS rapidly spread to 32 countries, creating panic among the public and in the World Health Organization (WHO). [1] [2] [3] The initial outbreak of SARS included more than 8000 individuals diagnosed with the disease. Of these, 774 lives were claimed. 4 SARS is characterized by a high fever (>38\u00b0C), malaise, headache, rigor and a non-productive cough. 5 The causative agent of SARS has been identified as a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 6 that encodes several viral proteases that proteolyze polyproteins to yield functional proteins. One such highly conserved cysteine protease is the main protease (M pro ), also known as the dimeric chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ). 7-9 3CL pro mediates the majority of proteolytic processes involved in producing two large viral polyproteins, replicases pb1a and pb1b. [7] [8] [9] The active site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro contains Cys145 and His41, which together constitute a catalytic dyad in which the cysteine moiety functions as a common nucleophile in the proteolytic process. 9, 10 Since SARS-CoV 3CL pro plays an important role in the virus life cycle, it has been recognized as a key target for the discovery of anti-SARS agents. Numerous SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors have been identified through chemical library screenings [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] or rational design approaches based on the active site properties. [17] [18] [19] [20] These protease inhibitors include C2-symmetric peptidomimetics, 11 3-quinolinecarboxylic acid derivatives, 12 bifunctional arylboronic acids, 13 keto-glutamine derivatives, 14 isatin derivatives, 15 thiophene-2-carboxylates, 16 zinc conjugated compounds, 17 cinanserin, 18 calmodulin, 19 benzotriazoles, 20 a,b-unsaturated acids, 21 anilide, 22 and glutamic acid and glutamine peptides possessing a trifluoromethyl ketone group. 23, 24 In our ongoing effort to develop anti-SARS agents, we previously identified a series of Z-Val-Leu-Ala(pyrrolidone-3-yl)-2-thiazoles as SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. 25 Among these compounds, compound 1 (Fig. 1 ) was identified as a potent lead compound with a K i value of 2.20 lM. 25 Primary structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of 1 have revealed that the presence of a rigid cyclic amide (P1-site) and the electron-withdrawing chemical warhead thiazolyl-2-ketone (P1 0 -moiety) are very important for the inhibitory activity. In the present study, we performed a molecular modeling study involving 1 and the 3CL pro . The study revealed the presence of a space in the Table 2 . The imidazole-type compounds 4 were prepared as indicated in Scheme 3. Another key imidazole thiazole 17 was prepared from the commercially available Boc-His(Tos)-OH 14 using the same reactions and conditions as indicated for the preparation of the c-lactam thiazoles 13. The tosyl-protected 17 was successfully converted to the imidazole-type analogs 4 via deprotection and coupling chemistry, as described for the preparation of 2, 3 and 5.",

Determining the kinetic parameters at a constant substrate concentration and different inhibitor concentrations assessed K i values. The initial rate measurements were determined as previously described using a fluorescence-based peptide cleavage assay with a fluorogenic substrate, Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans. 24, 30 The rate of substrate cleavage was detected by the increase in fluorescent over time (see Section 6.7).

These results strongly suggested that an electron-donating substituent on the phenyl ring of the P4-moiety was important and favorable to enhance inhibitory activity against 3CL pro . Isosteric replacement around the P4-scaffold in the context of 2j yielded notable differences from the inhibitory activities of 2j. Replacement of phenoxy (2j) with pyridinyloxy (2s) did not hamper the inhibitory potency. Interestingly, the potency was recovered upon phenylamino substitution (2t: IC 50 = 1.5 lM). The chain length between the P4-carbonyl and the phenyl group contributed significantly to the inhibitor potency, as indicated by a decreased in the activity of the analog 2u (IC 50 = 7.5 lM).",

Compound 3a, in which L-leucine was replaced with D-leucine, dramatically reduced the inhibitory activity. Replacement with bulky hydrophobic side chains, such as cyclohexylmethyl (3b) and benzyl (3c) resulted in solubility issue in the enzyme assay, and replacement with polar glutamic acid (3d) did not increase the inhibitory potency. L-leucine, therefore, appeared to provide a suitable stereochemistry and appropriate size for the P2-moiety to fit into the S2-pocket. This result also well correlated with the docking study.",

A docking study of the initial lead compound 1 bound to the SARS-CoV 3CL pro provided a better understanding of the inhibitor-active site structure and interactions. These studies led to the development of several potent inhibitors, including 2i, 2k, 2m, 2o, and 2p with IC 50 or K i values in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Compounds 2i and 2p exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity, with K i values of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively. These results clearly indicated that the peptidomimetics were promising inhibitors for the development of potential therapeutic agents against SARS. The structural requirements of the peptidomimetics displaying potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL pro could be summarized as follows: (i) a benzothiazole unit was effectively accommodated as a chemical warhead by the S1 0pocket; (ii) hydrogen-bonding capabilities at the cyclic lactam at the S1-position; (iii) appropriate stereochemistry and a size-appropriate L-leucine moiety in the S2-hydrophobic pocket and (iv) a unique folding conformation assumed by the phenoxyacetyl moiety at the S4-site.",

The resin was filtered, washed with DMF and CH 2 Cl 2 and dried under vacuum to yield 6. After removal of the Fmoc-group using 20% piperidine in DMF over 20 min, the next appropriate amino acid was coupled to the resin using the coupling agents DIC (3 equiv) and HOBt (3 equiv) by solid-phase synthesis techniques. The resulting intermediate 7 was then treated with 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 min to remove the Fmocgroup and subsequently reacted with the corresponding carboxylic acid (3 equiv) by the DIC-HOBt method or acid chloride (3 equiv) in the presence of Et 3 N to produce 8. Finally, the resin was treated with TFA/H 2 O (10:1, 2 mL), and the mixture was filtered after 1 h.
