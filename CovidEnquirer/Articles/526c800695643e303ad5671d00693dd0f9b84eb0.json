This allows the user for custom filtering of the acquired poly(A) measurements. Optionally, tailfindr allows the user to generate read-specific plots displaying the raw data and all signal derivatives generated in the process to estimate poly(A) tail length ( While this study was in progress, another tool estimating poly(A) tail lengths from ONT RNA data has been developed [32] . Instead of estimating poly(A) tails from basecalled data directly, this tool requires read alignment information for the definition of the poly(A) tail segment. To compare whether our algorithm results in similar performance, we measured poly(A) tail lengths from Nanopolish and tailfindr on different barcoded eGFP molecules. Our analysis shows that both tools match in precision and length estimation, as exemplified in Figure 1E for 40 and 100 nt poly(A) tail length.",

Therefore, cDNA sequencing approaches that retain the full-length poly(A) tail would enable studies where material is scarce as well as increase statistical power of poly(A) tail estimates. We thus aimed to expand tailfindr to operate on ONT DNA sequencing approaches as well. Since standard cDNA approaches result in double-stranded DNA, both poly(A) as well as poly(T) stretches are present in ONT sequencing reads. During cDNA sequencing both of these strands are threaded through the pore separately from 5' to 3' (Fig. 2A) . Indeed we observe homogenous stretches of raw signal both at the beginning (poly(T) tail) as well as at the end (poly(A) tail) of individual raw read sequences (example for poly(T)-containing read in Figure S3B ).",

Most significantly, we account for the double-stranded nature of DNA and define the read type (poly(A)-or poly(T)-containing) by making use of known sequence motifs in Nanopore Adapters (details in Material and Methods). As for RNA sequencing, tailfindr provides the user with a tabular output of tail length measurements (including the read type) as well as optional raw data plots ( Figure S3 ). We tested the performance of the DNA-specific tailfindr algorithm on PCR products of eGFP coding sequence with known poly(A)/(T) length in two replicates, similar to the spike-ins generated for native RNA sequencing. As shown in Figure 2C Next we compared poly(A)-length estimates from PCR-DNA and native RNA sequencing. We observed that DNA sequencing results in significantly more precise estimation of poly(A) tail length, mainly due to fewer outliers towards longer poly(A) tail lengths (Fig. 2D ). Especially the shortest poly(A) tail length (10 nt) could be estimated more correctly in DNA sequencing (mode of poly(A) length estimation 10 in DNA vs 22 in RNA sequencing). On other poly(A) lengths the mode of poly(A) estimation does not differ dramatically, but the precision of measurement is significantly higher in DNA sequencing approaches (coefficient of variation 50% in native RNA sequencing vs 30% in DNA sequencing). In summary, tailfindr is able to estimate poly(A) and poly(T) tail size from ONT DNA sequencing with significantly higher precision compared to ONT RNA sequencing estimation.",

Flip-flop model basecalling screens the raw signal by comparing probabilities to either stay in the same nucleotide state or change to a new state. Additionally, the raw data is read by averaging over two sample points, as opposed to averaging over five sample points in standard model basecalling. These improvements have been shown to result in higher quality basecalling, and more importantly to increase the basecall fidelity over homopolymer sequences [35] .

We show that tailfindr is able to detect the poly(A) tail boundaries of in vitro transcribed eGFP RNA molecules and estimate their lengths based on read-specific raw data normalisation. For molecules with known poly(A) tails from 30 nt up to 150 nt the estimates match well with the expected lengths (Fig. 1D) , however the shortest poly(A) tail (10 nt) was estimated to have longer tails than expected. We believe that this bias can be explained by sample contamination of this RNA molecule during preparations, or by inefficient oligo-dT sequencing adapter ligation to poly(A) tail stretches at or below 10 nt. Consistent with the latter explanation we observed that the barcoded 10 nt RNA molecule was underrepresented in the RNA sequencing libraries compared to input quantities (data not shown). Overall, tailfindr correctly estimates poly(A) tail lengths of in vitro transcribed RNAs over a wide range of lengths.",

While poly(A) tail boundaries in raw signal are found to be essentially the same with the two different approaches (Fig. S2C,D) , the final calculated poly(A) tail lengths differ (Fig. S2A) . Specifically, tailfindr estimates short poly(A) stretches slightly longer than Nanopolish, while long poly(A) stretches result in shorter estimates in tailfindr. These differences can be explained by different calculation of the average nucleotide translocation rate ( Fig. S2B) which is used to normalise raw poly(A) tail measurements. Nanopolish normalises by calculating the readspecific median of the samples per nucleotide after removing 5% of the translocation rate outliers.

This allows for poly(A) tail studies independent of any other tool than the essential basecaller, which would allow for an integration of the tailfindr algorithm into the basecalling procedure. This in turn makes it possible to assign poly(A) tail lengths to individual reads in parallel to the sequencing procedure, making live poly(A) tail analysis feasible.",

Short-read sequencing approaches promise poly(A) measurements with just a few bases of deviation due to cyclic incorporation of nucleotides and integration of the fluorescence signal of multiple molecules towards one single basecall [20, [25] [26] [27] [28] . In contrast, ONT long-read sequencing measures individual single-stranded molecules, and single nucleotide changes are detected based on subtle changes in measured current levels. More importantly, the raw signal for ONT sequencing does not change over a homopolymeric region, making single-event detection almost impossible. Thus, ONT poly(A) length estimation relies on normalisation rather variable data taken from single-molecule measurements. Most of the variation observed in tailfindr poly(A) estimation thus comes from the sequencing process. However, the sequencing chemistry as well as the properties of the motor protein are under constant development. It is thus conceivable that in the near future an increase in speed and robustness of translocation rates can be observed, which will have a positive impact on poly(A) tail estimation [35] .",

Third, since the native molecule is sequenced as it comes from the specimen, additional features of the RNA can measured directly, as was shown for RNA modifications [32, 40] . Fourth, and most importantly, long-read sequencing allows direct assignment of transcript isoforms to single molecules without bioinformatics post-processing, making truly isoform-specific measurements of poly(A) tail lengths possible. Additionally, ONT sequencing allows to study features of 5'-end and 3'-end events of the same molecule in conjunction with the poly(A) tail length.

This is mainly explained by a faster and more robust translocation rate with less likelihood for stochastic stalling during sequencing. Interestingly, poly(T) stretches are commonly estimated slightly longer than poly(A) stretches from the same sample (Fig. 2C) .

To determine the read orientation, the Nanopore-specific Front and End Primer sequences (sequences in Table 2 ) are aligned against the first 100 bases extracted from FAST5 files. A read is considered poly(T)-containing, if the normalised alignment score of End Primer sequence is greater than that of the Front Primer sequence, and above the threshold of 0.6. Conversely, a read is considered poly(A)-containing if the normalised alignment score of Front Primer sequence is greater than that of the End Primer sequence, and above the threshold of 0.6. To ensure that the full poly(A) tail is present in raw data, signal is generated by applying a sliding window (window size 10; stride 10) to the processed raw signal. Next, the slope of this mean signal is calculated between every two consecutive points. The precise start of the respective tail is considered to be the first location after the rough start site where the calculated slope is between -0.2 and 0.2, and the mean signal is between 0 to 0.3. To identify the precise tail end, the slope and the mean signals downstream of the precise tail start site are tested for violating their respective thresholds (see above). Since short non-tail-like signal spikes can randomly occur, we test the signal downstream of this tentative tail end for tail-like signal within thresholds until we either reach the end of the search window of 3000 sample points, or find another stretch of tail-like signal of at least 60 sample points in length. In the latter case, the tentative tail end is updated to the downstream tail end to account for the spike signal. The maximum allowable signal length exceeding the threshold that is located between two tail-like signal has been to set to 120 nt (e.g. 120x read-specific nucleotide translocation rate).",

Furthermore, the translocation speed can be influenced by RNA or DNA modifications, which however should not affect RNA sequencing from in vitro transcribed molecules, or DNA sequencing PCR-amplified molecules. Importantly, the motor protein for RNA and DNA differs, leading to dramatically different average translocation speed (70 nt for RNA in ONT Kits SQK-RNA001 vs. 450 nt for DNA in ONT Kits SQK-LSK108).

In basecalled ONT sequence data, a 'move' in raw data describes a single-nucleotide translocation through the pore. To calculate the average read-specific nucleotide translocation rate, we first extract a vector containing the number of sample points per move from the FAST5 events table of each individual read. If a move of 2 is detected (does not occur in basecalling with Flip-flop models), we divide the number of sample points by 2, as we reason that a preceding nucleotide translocation was not detected by the basecaller. From the resulting distribution of sample points per move, we then compute the geometric mean. This strategy results in robust estimation of poly(A) tail length for both ONT RNA and DNA sequencing approaches with standard model basecalling ( Fig. 1D; Fig. 2C ). In our experience, this approach is resulting in more robust normalisation compared to normalisation by the median of single-nucleotide translocation rates, which is used in Nanopolish ( Fig. S2B ; [32] ).",

In this approach, the raw current level data is decoded by averaging 2 sample points instead of 5, resulting in higher-resolution basecalling. Additionally, we could not observe moves of 2, which in most cases represent missed nucleotide translocations. When we calculate the readspecific nucleotide translocation rate from reads basecalled with standard and Flip-flop models, we routinely observe lower average values for Flip-flop model basecalling. The calculated geometric mean of moves is often below 8. The geometric mean calculated from standard model basecalling routinely results in translocation rates between 8 and 9, which agrees with average translocation rates communicated by ONT (unpublished communications). Compared to standard model basecalling it is possible that Flip-flop model basecalling over-segments the raw data, resulting in too low average nucleotide translocation rates when calculated by the geometric mean. This is exemplified by the observation that the most frequently observed nucleotide translocation rate is 2 samples, the lowest possible value considering the resolution of 2 sample points. Instead of calculating the average rate by geometric mean, we used the arithmetic mean after discarding the 5% highest outliers as an approximation of the right normaliser, based on comparisons to results obtained by standard model basecalling on the same PCR-DNA molecules.",

            "text": "Fig. S1B). To test the performance of our algorithm, we pooled six barcoded in vitro transcribed eGFP RNA samples with different poly(A) tail lengths (10 nt; 30 nt; 40 nt; 60 nt; 100 nt; 150 nt) and sequenced the pooled samples with ONT's native RNA sequencing kit in two replicates. Only reads that cover the full RNA molecule were considered for the analysis. After barcode demultiplexing, the estimated poly(A) tail length match in general with the expected value, with the exception of eGFP with poly(A) tail length of 10 nt (Fig. 1D). While the molecule with expected 10 nt poly(A) length was measured with a mode of 22, the mode of all other barcoded RNA molecules matches well with the expected poly(A) length values (30 nt: 34; 40 nt: 41; 60 nt: 59; 100 nt: 93; 150 nt: 141). However, even though the majority of sequences show the expected poly(A) tail length, the standard deviation of poly(A) tail measurements is rather high (coefficient of variation of around 50%). Thus, while the precision of poly(A) estimation is limited mainly due to outliers towards longer poly(A) lengths (Fig. 1D), the length of most barcoded molecules can be successfully estimated by the use of tailfindr on ONT RNA sequencing.",

For all poly(A)/(T) tail lengths bigger than 10 nt, a small subpopulation of reads with shorter estimated tails could be observed, possibly due to incorrectly assigned barcodes. While poly(A) and poly(T) estimates show very similar density distributions for length estimates, poly(T) lengths are routinely slightly longer than estimates for poly(A) lengths.",

            "text": "We implement changes in tailfindr to account for the updates in Flip-flop model raw data output. As expected, Flipflop model basecalling detects more nucleotide translocations (called 'moves') over poly(A) stretches when compared to standard model basecalling(Fig. 3A, yellow highlights). To test whether the detected moves agree with expected poly(A)/(T) length, we plotted the moves from either standard model basecalling(Fig. 3B) or Flip-flop model basecalling (Fig. 3C) on eGFP-PCR products with 30 nt or 100 nt poly(A)/(T) tail length. While Flip-flop model basecalling resulted in significantly more moves over poly(A)/(T) tail sections compared to standard model basecalling, the detected number of moves still severely underestimate the existing poly(A)/(T) lengths. Thus even with improved homopolymer basecalling fidelity, external tools are needed to correctly measure poly(A) tail lengths. We used tailfindr to compare poly(A) and poly(T) tail measurements from the same sequencing reads basecalled either with Flip-flop or standard models, and could show that the estimated poly(A)/(T) tail length is highly correlated between the two basecalling approaches (R = 0.93 for poly(A); R = 0.97 for poly(T); Fig. 3D,E). We thus conclude that tailfindr operates on both standard and the most recent Flip-flop model basecalling, and provides accurate poly(A)/(T) length estimates for ONT DNA sequencing approaches.",
