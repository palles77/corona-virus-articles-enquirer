The cause of the primary demyelination is a direct cytocidal effect of the virus on infected oligodendroglia (Weiner, 1973; Lampert et al. 1973) . Oligodendrocytes are the neural cells responsible for the synthesis and maintenance of the myelin sheath that surrounds axons. This myelin sheath permits the efficient conduction of electrical impulses along the axon. The mechanism(s) of the virus' cytocidal effect is not known at present. Remyelination of the denuded axon is accomplished in animals surviving the primary demyelination by proliferation of noninfected oligodendrocytes and resheathing of the denuded axons by the proliferated oligodendrocytes (Herndon et al., 1977) . Occasional animals have recurrent bouts of demyelination and remyelination, but little is known about the pathogenesis of this recurrent demyelination.",

Virus stocks were grown at 33\" using an m.0.i. of 10-4. Virus adsorption was at a cell concentration of 5 x 10Yml of DEBB.

Although the virus stocks have defective particles present, these defective particles seem to have little \"interfering\" potential because there is no reduction in the number of progeny-infectious virus during 40 serial undiluted passages of these viruses in the 1'7CL-16 cells (Robb, unpublished observation) . The mechanism of the multiplicitydependent burst size is currently not known. The data in Table 1 also show that the maximum yield of virus occurs within 12 hpi at 38.5\" and then has a multiplicitydependent decrease with time. of progeny virus production occurred by the recruitment of uninfected cells into infected syncytia, then the burst size of infected cells in sparse culture, where syncytial formation is markedly inhibited due to the distance between cells, should be proportionately smaller than the maximal yield from infected cells in dense culture. To test this prediction, a pool of 17CL-16 cells was infected with a low multiplicity and then diluted into replicate 32-mm petri dishes. The subsequent burst size was then determined as shown in Table 2 . These data clearly show that recruitment of uninfected cells into syncytia does not amplify the number of progeny virus producing a larger burst size. In addition, we have isolated temperature-sensitive mutants that do not form syncytia at 38.5\", and that have no reduction in the virus yield at 38.5\" as compared to the yield at 33\" . All of these observations demonstrate that syncytia formation is not necessary for the production of progeny virus and, moreover, that the progeny virus are probably primarily produced in the cell that is initially infected. The reason for the reduced burst size of JHMV-infected cells during sparse and dense culture, but not during infection in the intermediate cell concentrations, has yet to be determined.",
