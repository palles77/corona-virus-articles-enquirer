We find American Airlines having just reported the largest financial loss in US airline history, while Delta and Northwest Airlines along with smaller carriers like Alaska, America West and several regional carriers are restructuring and employing cost reduction strategies. We also find Continental Airlines surviving after having been in and out of Chapter 11 in recent years, while Southwest Airlines continues to be profitable. In Canada, we find Air Canada in Companies Creditors Arrangement Act (CCA) bankruptcy protection (the Canadian version of Chapter 11), after reporting losses of over $500 million for the year 2002 and in March 2003. Meanwhile WestJet, like Southwest continues to show profitability, while two new carriers, Jetsgo and CanJet (reborn), have entered the market.",

Until recently, Asian air travel markets were performing somewhat better than in North America, however the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic had a severe negative effect on many Asian airlines. 2 Clearly, the current environment is linked to several independent negative demand shocks that have hit the industry hard. 3 slowdown was already underway in 2001, prior to the 9-11 tragedy, which gave rise to the 'war on terrorism' followed by the recent military action in Iraq. Finally, the SARS virus has not only severely diminished the demand for travel to areas where SARS has broken out and led to fatalities, but it has also helped to create yet another reason for travellers to avoid visiting airports or travelling on aircraft, based on a perceived risk of infection. All of these factors have created an environment where limited demand and price competition has favoured the survival of airlines with a low-cost, lowprice focus.",

Delta Airlines, for example, had organized its network into a hub at Atlanta with multiple spokes. Other carriers had evolved more linear networks with generally full connectivity and were reluctant to shift to hub-and-spoke for two reasons. First, regulations required permission to exit markets and such exit requests would likely lead to another carrier entering to serve 'public need'. Secondly, under regulation it was not easy to achieve the demand side benefits associated with networks because of regulatory barriers to entry. In the era of economic regulation the choice of frequency and ancillary service competition were a direct result of being constrained in fare and market entry competition. With deregulation, airlines gained the freedom to adapt their strategies to meet market demand and to reorganize themselves spatially. Consequently, huband-spoke became the dominant choice of network structure.",

They also created travel products with high convenience and service levels-reduced likelihood of lost luggage, in-flight meals and bar service for example. The FSA business model thus favoured high service levels which helped to build the market the market at a time when air travel was an unusual or infrequent activity for many individuals.

It can locate assembly in low-cost countries and this was enhanced under new trade liberalization with the WTO. 4 Canada's deregulation was not formalised under the National Transportation Act until 1987. Australia and New Zealand signed an open skies agreement in 2000, which created a single Australia-New Zealand air market, including the right of cabotage. Canada and the US signed an open skies agreement well in 1996 but not nearly so liberal as the Australian-New Zealand one. 5 In contrast to deregulation within domestic borders, international aviation has been slower to introduce unilateral liberalization. Consequently the degree of regulation varies across routes, fares, capacity, entry points (airports) and other aspects of airline operations depending upon the countries involved. The US-UK, German, Netherlands and Korea bilaterals are quite liberal, for example. In some cases, however, most notably in Australasia and Europe, there have been regional air trade pacts, which have deregulated markets between and within countries.

If the causal impetus of the current crisis was limited to cyclical macro factors combined with independent demand shocks, then one would expect the institutions that were previously dominant to re-emerge once demand rebounds. If this seems unlikely it is because the underlying market environment has evolved into a new market structure, one in which old business models and practices are no longer viable or desirable. The evolution of business strategies and markets, like biological evolution is subject to the forces of selection. Airlines who cannot or do not adapt their business model to long-lasting changes in the environment will disappear, to be replaced by those companies whose strategies better fit the evolved market structure.

In our simple example, of a flight from A to C via hub H the carrier has to consider how pricing of the AH link might affect the demand for service on the HB link. If the service were offered by separate companies, the company serving AH will take no consideration of how the fare it charged would influence the demand on the HB link since it has no right to the revenue on that link. The FSA business model thus creates complexity as the network grows, making the system work effectively requires additional features most notably, yield management and product distribution. In the period following deregulation, technological progress provided the means to manage this complexity, with large information systems and in particular computer reservation systems. Computer reservation systems make possible sophisticated flight revenue management, the development of loyalty programs, effective product distribution, revenue accounting and load dispatch. They also drive aircraft capacity, frequency and scheduling decisions. As a consequence, the FSA business model places relative importance on managing complex schedules and pricing systems with a focus on profitability of the network as a whole rather than individual links. The FSA business model favours a high level of service and the creation of a large service bundle (inflight entertainment, meals, drinks, large numbers of ticketing counters at the hub, etc.) which serves to maximize the revenue yields from business and longhaul travel. An important part of the business service bundle is the convenience that is created through fully flexible tickets and high flight frequencies. High frequencies can be developed on spoke routes using smaller feed aircraft, and the use of a hub with feed traffic from spokes allows more flights for a given traffic density and cost level. More flights reduce total trip time, with increased flexibility. Thus, the hub-and-spoke system leads to the development of feed arrangements along spokes. Indeed these domestic feeds contributed to the development of international alliances in which one airline would feed another utilizing the capacity of both to increase service and pricing.",

In all cases the structure of the network is a key factor in the success of VBAs even in the current economic and demand downturn. VBAs tend to exhibit common product and process design characteristics that enable them to operate at a much lower cost per unit of output. 9 On the demand side, VBAs have created a unique value proposition through product and process design that enables them to eliminate, or ''unbundle'' certain service features in exchange for a lower fare. These service feature trade-offs are typically: less frequency, no meals, no free, or any, alcoholic beverages, more passengers per flight attendant, no lounge, no interlining or code-sharing, electronic tickets, no pre-assigned seating, and less leg room. Most importantly the VBA does not attempt to connect its network although their may be connecting nodes. It also has people use their own time to access or feed the airport. 10 There are several key areas in process design (the way in which the product is delivered to the consumer) for a VBA that result in significant savings over a full service carrier. One of the primary forms of process design savings is in the planning of point-to-point city pair flights, focusing on the local origin and destination market rather than developing hub systems. In practice, this means that flights are scheduled without connections and stops in other cities. This could also be considered product design, as the passenger notices the benefit of travelling directly to their desired destination rather than through a hub. Rather than having a bank of flights arrive at airports at the same time, low-cost carriers spread out the staffing, ground handling, maintenance, food services, bridge and gate requirements at each airport to achieve savings.",

Many low-cost start-ups have attempted to replicate that model as closely as possible; however, the hardest area to replicate has proved to be the organization design and culture. 11 Extending the ''look and feel'' to the aircraft, there is a noticeable strategy for low-cost airlines. Successful VBAs focus on a homogeneous fleet type (mostly the Boeing 737 but this is changing; e.g. Jet Blue with A320 fleet). The advantages of a 'common fleet' are numerous. Purchasing power is one-with the obvious exception of the aircraft itself, heavy maintenance, parts, supplies; even safety cards are purchased in one model for the entire fleet. Training costs are reduced-with only one type of fleet, not only do employees focus on one aircraft and become specialists, but economies of density can be achieved in training.",

Further, secondary airports are less congested, allowing for faster turn times and more efficient use of staff and the aircraft.

The entrenched FSA carriers' focuses on developing hub and spoke networks while new entrants seem intent on creating low-cost, point-to-point structures. The hub and spoke system places a very high value on the feed traffic brought to the hub by the spokes, especially the business traffic therein, thereby creating a complex, marketing intense business where revenue is the key and where production costs are high. Inventory (of seats) is also kept high in order to meet the service demands of business travellers. The FSA strategy is a high cost strategy because the hub-and-spoke network structure means both reduced productivity for capital (aircraft) and labour (pilots, cabin crew, airport personnel) and increased costs due to self-induced congestion from closely spaced banks of aircraft. 13 The FSA business strategy is sustainable as long as no subgroup of passengers can defect from the coalition of all passenger groups, and recognizing this, competition between FSAs included loyalty programs designed to protect each airline's coalition of passenger groupsfrequent travellers in particular. The resulting market structure of competition between FSAs was thus a cozy oligopoly in which airlines competed on prices for some economy fares, but practiced complex price discrimination that allowed high yields on business travel. However, the vulnerability of the FSA business model was eventually revealed through the VBA strategy which (a) picked and chose only those origin-destination links that were profitable and (b) targeted price sensitive consumers. 14 The potential therefore was not for business travellers to defect from FSAs (loyalty programs helped to maintain this segment of demand) but for leisure travellers and other infrequent flyers to be lured away by lower fares (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Where the model runs into difficulties is in explaining the emergence of limited point-to-point networks and the VBA model. It is the symmetric structure of the model that renders it unable to capture some important elements of the environment in which VBAs have been able to thrive. In particular, three elements of asymmetry are missing. First, the model does not allow for asymmetric demand growth between nodes in the network. With market growth, returns to density can increase on a subset of links that would have been feeder spokes in the hub-and-spoke system when the market was less developed. These links may still be infeasible for FSAs but become feasible and profitable as independent point-to-point operations, providing an airline has low enough costs. Second, the model does not distinguish between market demand segments and therefore cannot capture the gradual commoditization of air travel, as more consumers become frequent flyers. To many consumers today, air travel is no longer an exotic product with an air of mystery and an association with wealth and luxury. There has been an evolution of preferences that reflects the perception that air travel is just another means of getting from A to B. As the perceived nature of the product becomes more commodity-like, consumers become more price sensitive and are willing to trade off elements of service for lower prices. 15 VBAs use their low fares to grow the market by competing with other activities. Their low cost structure permits such a strategy. FSAs cannot do this to any degree because of their choice of bundled product and higher costs. Third, the model does not capture important asymmetries in the costs of FSAs and VBAs, such that VBAs have significantly lower marginal and fixed costs. Notice that the dominance of the hub-and-spoke structure over the FC network relies in part on the cost disadvantage of a fixed cost per link, which becomes prohibitive in the FC network as the number of nodes (n) gets large. VBAs do not suffer from this disadvantage because they can pick and choose only those nodes that are profitable. Furthermore, FSAs variable costs are higher because of the higher fixed costs associated with their choice of hub-and-spoke network.",

We know that a structural shift in the composition (i.e., more low-cost airlines) of the industry is occurring and travel substitutes are pushing down fares and traffic. We also observe that heightened security has increased the time and transacting costs of trips and these are driving away business, particularly short haul business trips.

V is an index of travel convenience, related to flight frequency and P is the delivered price of travel. This reduces each consumer's choice problem to consumption of a composite commodity priced at $1, and the possibility of taking at most one trip per period. Utility is increasing in V and decreasing in P, thus travellers are willing to tradeoff convenience for a lower delivered price. Diversity in the willingness to trade off convenience for would be represented by distribution for Y, g; and V over some range of parameter values. Thus the growth of value-based demand for air travel would be represented by an increase in the density of consumers with relatively low value of these parameters. 16 The empty core theory is often applied to industries that exhibit significant economies of scale, airlines are thought generally to have limited if any scale economies but they do exhibit significant density economies. These density economies are viewed as providing conditions for an empty core.

This will depend in part upon natural (technological) and strategic barriers to entry, and on the response that can be expected if entry occurs. Thus entry only occurs if the expected profits exceed the sunk costs of entry. While natural variation in demand conditions may induce firms to make errors in their predictions, resulting in entry and exit decisions, this is not the same thing as an 'empty core '. 17 In the air travel industry, incumbent firms (especially FSAs) spend considerable resources to protect their market shares from internal and external competition.

            "text": "What about the threat of entry or the expansion of operations by VBAs? Could this lead to exit by FSAs? There may be legitimate concern from FSAs concerning the sustainability of the full-service business model when faced with low-cost competition. In particular, the use of frequency as an attribute of service quality by FSAs generates revenues from high-value business travellers, but these revenues only translate into profits when there are enough economy travellers to satisfy load factors. So, to the extent that VBAs steal away market share from FSAs they put pressure on the viability of this aspect of the FSA business model. The greatest threat to the FSA from a VBA is that a lower the fare structure offered to a subset of passengers may induce the FSA to expand the proportion of seats offered to lower fares within the yield management system. This will occur with those VBAs like Southwest, Virgin Blue in Australia and easyjet that do attempt to attract the business traveller from small and medium size firms. However, carriers like Ryanair and Westjet have a lower impact on overall fare structure since their frequencies are lower and the FSA can target the VBAs flights. 18 While FSAs may find themselves engaged in price and/or quality competition, the economics of price competition with differentiated products suggests that such markets can sustain oligopoly structures in which firms earn positive profits. This occurs because the prices of competing firms become strategic complements. That is, when one firm increases its price, the profit maximizing response of competitors is to raise price also and there are many dimensions on which airlines can product differentiate within the FSA business model. 19 There is no question FSAs have higher seat mile costs than VBAs. The problem comes about when FSAs view their costs as being predominately fixed and hence marginal costs as being very low. This 'myopic' view ignores the need to cover the long run cost of capital. This in conjunction with the argument that network revenue contribution justifies most all routes, leads to excessive network size and severe price discounting. 20 However, when economies are buoyant, high yield traffic provides sufficient revenues to cover costs and provide substantial profit. In their assessment of the US airline industry, Morrison and Winston (1995) argue that the vast majority of losses incurred by FSAs up to that point were due to their own fare, and fare war, strategies. It must be remembered that FSAs co-exist with Southwest in large numbers of markets in the US.",

In Germany, both Lufthansa and Deutsche BA have been charged with predatory pricing. In Australia, Qantas also faces predatory pricing charges. Gillen and Morrison (2003) points out three important dimensions of predatory pricing in air travel markets. First, demand complementarities in hub-andspoke networks lead FSAs to focus on 'beyond revenues'-the revenue generated by a series of flights in an itinerary rather than the revenues generated by any one leg of the trip. FSAs therefore justify aggressive price competition with a VBA as a means of using the fare on that link (from an origin node to the hub node for example) as a way of maximizing the beyond revenues created when passengers purchase travel on additional links (from the hub to other nodes in the network). The problem with this argument is that promotional pricing is implicitly a bundling argument, where the airline bundles links in the network to maximize revenue. However when FSAs compete fiercely on price against VBAs, the price on that link is not limited to those customers who demand beyond travel. Therefore, whether or not there is an intent to engage in predatory pricing, the effect is predatory as it deprives the VBA of customers who do not demand beyond travel.",

In standard limit output models of entry deterrence, an investment in capacity is not a credible threat to of price competition if the entrant conjectures that the incumbent will not use that capacity once entry occurs. Such models utilize the notion that a capacity investment is an irreversible commitment and that valuable reputation effects cannot be generated by the incumbent engaging in 'irrational' price competition. However in a hub-and-spoke network, an FSA can make a credible threat to transfer capacity to a particular link in the network in support of aggressive price competition, with the knowledge that the capacity can be redeployed elsewhere in the network when the competitive threat is over. This creates a positive barrier to entry with reputation effects occurring in those instances where entry occurs. Such was the case when CanJet and WestJet met with aggressive price competition from Air Canada on flights from Monkton NB to Toronto (Air Canada and CanJet) and Hamilton (WestJet). The FSA defense against such charges is that aircraft do not constitute an avoidable cost and should not be included in any price-cost test of predation. Yet while aircraft are not avoidable with respect to the network, they are avoidable to the extent they can be redeployed around the network. If aircraft costs become included in measures of predation under competition laws, this will limit the success of price competition as a competitive response by an FSAs responding to VBA entry.",

The higher yield passengers have not disappeared the market has only become somewhat smaller and certainly more fare sensitive, on average.",

            "text": "FSAs have responded to VBAs by trying to copy elements of their business strategy including reduced inflight service, low cost [fighting] brands, and more pointto-point service. However, the ability of FSA to co-exist with VBA and hence hub-and-spoke networks with linear networks is to redesign their products and provide incentives for passengers to allow a reduction in product, process and organizational complexity. This is a difficult challenge since they face complex demands, resulting in the design of a complex product and delivered in a complex network, which is a characteristic of the product. For example, no-shows are a large cost for FSA and they have to design their systems in such a way as to accommodate the no-shows. This includes over-booking and the introduction of demand variability. This uncertain demand arises because airlines have induced it with service to their high-yield passengers. Putting in place a set of incentives to reduce noshows would lower costs because the complexity would be reduced or eliminated. One should have complexity only when it adds value. Another costly feature of serving business travel is to maintain sufficient inventory of seats in markets to meet the time sensitive demands of business travellers.",

            "text": "The hub-and-spoke structure is complex, the business processes are complex and these create costs. A huband-spoke network lowers productivity and increases variable and fixed costs, but these are not characteristics inherent in the hub-and-spoke design. They are inherent in the way FSA use the hub-and-spoke network to deliver and add value to their product. This is because the processes are complex even though the complexity is needed for a smaller, more demanding, higher yield set of customers. The redesigning of business processes moves the FSA between cost functions and not simply down their existing cost function but they will not duplicate the cost advantage of VBAs. The network structure drives pricing, fleet and service strategies and the network structure is ultimately conditional on the size and preferences in the market.",

            "text": "American has also reduced its turn around at spoke cities from 2.5 h previously to approximately 42 min. 22 As a result of smoother traffic flows, American has been operating at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport with nine fewer mainline aircraft and two fewer regional aircraft. At Chicago, the improved efficiency has allowed American to take five aircraft off the schedule, three large jets and two American Eagle aircraft. American estimates savings of $100 million a year from reduced costs for fuel, facilities and personnel, part of the $2 billion in permanent costs it has trimmed from its expense sheet. The new flight schedule has brought unexpected cost relief at the hubs but also at the many ''spoke'' cities served from these major airports. Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 2, 2002 and February 18, 2003. 23 Interestingly, from an airport perspective the passenger may not spend more total elapsed time but simply more time in the terminal and less time in the airplane. This may provide opportunities for nonaviation revenue strategies. with their networks are continuously evolving. What took place in the US 10 years ago is now occurring in Europe. A 'modern' feature of networks is the strategic alliance. Alliances between airlines allow them to extend their network, improve their product and service choice but at a cost. Alliances are a feature associated with FSAs not VBAs. It may be that as FSAs reposition themselves they will make greater use of alliances. VBAs on the other hand will rely more on interlining to extend their market reach. Interlining is made more cost effective with modern technologies but also with airports having an incentive to offer such services rather than have the airlines provide them. Airports as modern businesses will have a more active role in shaping airline networks in the future.",
