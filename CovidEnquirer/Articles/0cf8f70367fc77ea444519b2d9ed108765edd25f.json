However, it has a distinct overall histological pattern, characterized by intra-alveolar fibrin associated with OP in a patchy distribution. Since Beasley' s initial description, 14 individual case reports of AFOP have been published in English research papers. Although the histopathological features are well described, the clinical manifestations, course, and treatment of AFOP are not characterized. We report a case of a male with bilateral patchy lower lobes consolidation, in which lung biopsy revealed the classical histopathological features seen in AFOP.",

The most common symptoms reported were dyspnea in 11 patients, fever in 6 patients, and cough in 3 patients. Bilateral basilar infiltrates were the most common radiographic pattern. Seven of the 17 patients were treated with corticosteroids. Fourteen individual case reports of AFOP have been published in English, 2-15 after Beasley' s initial description. All patients had symptoms for less than 2 months, with cough and dyspnea as the most common. Radiographic abnormalities included bilateral basilar infiltrates in 11 patients, 2,3,5,7-15 while unilateral complete lung consolidation solitary nodule, 4 miliary nodules, and patchy consolidations 6 were noted in the remaining 3 patients. Identified exposures or associated conditions included medications (abacavir and decitabine), 5,10 connective tissue disease, 8, 11 hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 13 HIV, 7 juvenile dermatomyositis, 3 and Whipple disease. 15 No underlying cause or association were identified in 5 cases. 2, 4, 9, 12, 14 Patients were treated with medications including corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine. Among the 14 case reports, 3 patients required mechanical ventilation, 3, 5, 9 and 2 patients died. 3, 6 In addition to these individual case reports, Hwang et al 16 reported autopsy finding from the lungs of 20 patients who died from severe acute respiratory syndrome. The histological findings of these 20 patients were AFOP pattern in 6 cases, DAD in 8 cases, and both patterns in the remaining cases. In conclusion, AFOP is a newly recognized clinicopathological entity that is still underdiagnosed and underreported. Although the histopathological features are well described, identification of precipitating factors, clinical course, and elements affecting prognosis and treatment need to be fully established.",
