Plasma samples six months on average after the outbreak were tested for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies by SARS ELISA (Genelabs Diagnostics Pty Ltd, Singapore) from all participants [12] . DNAbased HLA typing was performed by Luminex Multi-Analyte Profiling system (xMAP) with WAKFlow HLA typing kit (Wakunaga, Hiroshima, Japan) as described elsewhere [13] . Briefly, highly polymorphic exons 2 and 3 of HLA-A, -B, and -C genes and exon 2 of HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 genes were amplified using primer pairs attached to the kit. Each PCR product was hybridized with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, complementary to the allele-specific sequences. Reproducibility was checked between two independent measurements of randomly chosen samples and the level of agreement was more than 99% (183/184 alleles). Samples showing ambiguous patterns were subjected to sequencebased typing by using AlleleSEQR HLA typing kit (Abbott JAPAN, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed on an ABI3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).",

Our finding that association of the above HLA class II alleles was stronger between Cases and Contacts than between Infected and Uninfected might also support its role in progress of the disease after infection, rather than in transmission of the virus to the host. Future investigation of the host-pathogen interaction is awaited. Our report and the above-mentioned articles [4, 5] did not support the findings of the remaining previous reports [2, 3] . The first one showed an association of HLA-B*46 and B*54 with development or severity of SARS in Taiwan [2] . The investigators analyzed 33 probable SARS patients, but this association was not significant when multiple testing was taken into consideration in their study. Further subgroup analysis of six severe or deceased cases should be carefully interpreted in general. Also, results from our study and three other studies could not reproduce the report from Hong Kong [3] . HLA-B*0703 showing positive association but not commonly observed in Asian populations including Hong Kong Chinese. Instead, B*0702 or B*0705 are known to be major alleles of the HLA-B7 serotype in Asia [24] . HLA-DRB1*0301 allele negatively associated with SARS in their study, is not so frequently seen in the Asian populations either [25] , but observed more commonly in European or African descent.

Although our conclusion here derives from the most rational deduction based on accumulated results of each small study, different associations in other studies could also be interpreted in other ways, for instance, by the interaction with other environmental or pathogenic factors such as possible difference of mutation in SARS-CoV. Alternatively, it is also possible that the HLA-genes are merely markers of the disease susceptibility and that other immune-related genes in the HLA regions may be more deeply involved in the risk of disease. Genetic contribution of non-HLA immune molecules has also been studied extensively even now [6 -8] . We should collect all information and prepare for the threat of a future outbreak of emerging diseases such as H5N1 infection that causes lethal acute lung injury presumably through a similar immune mechanism. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that an HLA class II allele, HLA-DRB1*1202 is a new candidate allele involved in the progress of SARS, which enabled us to evaluate previous HLA studies on the basis of alleles and haplotypes common to the Asian populations. Accumulation of these studies would also help when planning a future effective vaccination strategy.",
