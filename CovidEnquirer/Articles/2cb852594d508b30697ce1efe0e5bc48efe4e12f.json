Methods: Agendas in Committees A/B of the WHA were classified as Administrative or Technical and Health Matters. Agenda items of Health Matters were sorted into five categories by the WHO reform in the 65th WHA. The agenda items in each category and sub-category were counted. Results: There were 1647 agenda items including 423 Health Matters, which were sorted into five categories: communicable diseases (107, 25.3%), health systems (81, 19.1%), noncommunicable diseases (59, 13.9%), preparedness surveillance and response (58, 13.7%), and health through the life course (36, 8.5%). Among the sub-categories, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases in general, health for all, millennium development goals, influenza, and international health regulations, were discussed frequently and appeared associated with the public health milestones, but maternal and child health were discussed three times. The number of the agenda items differed for each Director-General's term of office. Conclusions: The WHA agendas cover a variety of items, but not always reflect international health issues in terms of disease burden. The Member States of WHO should take their responsive roles in proposing more balanced agenda items.",

Two data sources were used: agenda items from 2004 (57th WHA) to 2012 (65th WHA) were extracted from the WHO internet site [10] For all Health Matters, categories and sub-categories were created in order to analyse Health Matters further. Categories and sub-categories are set out in Table 1 . Categories were drawn from one of the 65th WHA agendas entitled \"WHO reform\" [11] . The five categories are (1) communicable diseases, (2) noncommunicable diseases, (3) health through the life course, (4) health systems, and (5) preparedness, surveillance and response. We added another category, (6) others, for agenda items which did not fit in these five categories. The sub-categories were developed with reference to the Handbook of Resolutions and Decisions of the World Health Assembly and Executive Board, Volumes I, II, and III [12] [13] [14] , and also in light of the functions of the WHO according to its Constitution, Article 2 [1] . In this labelling system, the health systems category includes items related to health policies, such as PHC, health for all by 2000, and MDGs, since health systems are strongly connected to the health policies. The sub-category 'Strengthening health systems' was defined according to the concept provided by the WHO in the Everybody's Business: Strengthening health systems to Improve Health Outcomes, WHO's Framework of Action [15] . The noncommunicable diseases category consists of 10 subcategories. One of them that includes the agendas entitled \"prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases\" or similar titles, was named as \"noncommunicable diseases in general\" to avoid any confusion between category and subcategory. Health issue milestones in the each category were selected from several publications and web sites [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

Second, among the five categories of the WHO reform, communicable diseases was the most discussed at 25.3%, followed by health systems at 19.1%, but health through the life course accounted for 8.5%, which was relatively small compared with the other categories. Third, among the sub-categories, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases in general, health for all, MDGs, influenza, and IHR discussed over nine times and appeared associated with the public health milestones, but MCH including newborn health was discussed only three times.

The period of low numbers of Health Matters corresponded with the period of a high number of agenda items for health for all in Fig. 2 . Even when there were no Health Matters in the WHA in 1985, WHO documentation mentioned that Technical Discussions entitled Collaboration with Non-Governmental Organizations in Implementing the Global Strategy for health for all seemed to have taken place separately from the Agenda in the WHA (WHA38/1985/REC/2). Having many debates between selective and comprehensive PHC as well as considerable obstacles to progress towards health for all [20] [21] [22] , the WHA in 1995 stressed the continued validity of health for all as a timeless aspirational goal and agreed that a new global health policy should be elaborated [23] . Thus, the Alma-Ata Declaration provided the revolutionary principles of health throughout the world in 1978 [24] , and WHA adopted the Global Strategy for Health for All by the year 2000 in 1981 [25] , which seemed to affect the number of WHA agenda items from the 1980s to mid-1990s. In short, the period from 1980 to the early 1990s can be summarized as a period of concentration on PHC.",

In this sub-category, the WHO has mainly focused on the breast milk issue, which led to the International Code on Marketing of Breast Milk Substitute (hereafter referred to as the Code) adopted in 1981. The objective of the Code was to restrict advertising of formula milk aiming to eliminate the negative impact on babies of formula milk, especially in the developing world. Within three years of its adoption, 130 countries had taken action by passing legislation or formulating policies to restrict advertising [28] . However, the formula milk industry continued to undermine the Code [29] [30] [31] . As Forsyth pointed out, it was not uncommon that a formula-milk company located in one country may violate the Code regulations in another country [32] . This must be a challenge for future WHA resolutions. Although MCH including newborn health is tremendously important [33, 34] , there were only three Health Matters related to MCH, including newborn health, in 1979, 1992 and 2007. It seems to be imbalanced agenda setting compared with the burdens of mortality and illness of infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases [35] [36] [37] .",

After the year 2007, the number of \"noncommunicable diseases in general\" as sub-category has increased mainly due to the agenda item named \"Prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases\". This ties up with the recent attentions on the diseases and leads to the United Nations High Level Meeting on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases [40] . It indicates that the WHA discussed the important agenda item which has great disease burden before any other major health organization may decide to do so. Regarding the IHR, WHA had frequently discussed and revised it as IHR (2005), which could respond timely the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and health risks and emergencies [41, 42] .",

Recognizing that the numbers of the agenda items do not directly reflect the weight of health issues, we selected a simple and clear way to compare the number of the agenda items in this analysis. Second, we did not focus on the resolutions, but on the agenda items of the WHA. Since a resolution was not always adopted from each agenda item, we decided to use the agenda items to analyse the trends and characteristics of international health issues. Third, we did not analyse WHO budgetary allocations relating to the WHA agenda items in this study. Stuckler et al. [43] noted that WHO biennial budget allocations from 1994-1995 to 2008-2009 were heavily skewed towards infectious diseases. Our data indicated that the WHA agenda items for the Communicable diseases from 1994 to 2009 accounted for 61 out of 196 Health Matters (31.1%) . Further studies about the resolutions and budgetary allocations would be our future challenge. Finally, we utilized the five categories from the WHO reform in the 65th WHA. Since the new categories are created for the WHO's priority setting and programmes, each category in our study includes a limited number of health issues based on that priority [11] . Thus, 82 agenda items were classified into others in our analysis. However, we believe that our analysis will help to consider the WHO reform and which agenda items should be discussed in the future WHA.",

Among the five categories of the WHO reform, communicable diseases was the most discussed, followed by health systems, but health through the life course was relatively small compared with the other categories. Among the sub-categories, HIV/AIDS, noncommunicable diseases in general, health for all, MDGs, influenza, and IHR discussed frequently and appeared associated with the public health milestones. The fact that the number of noncommunicable diseases in general as subcategory increased after 2007 deserves attention. However, the agenda items of the WHA do not always reflect international health issues in terms of burdens of mortality and illness, such as MCH including newborn health. Most of the WHA agenda items are decided by the Executive Board meeting every January. Therefore, reflecting from the number and the trend of the WHA agenda items, Member States and Associate Members of WHO should take more respective and responsive roles in setting agenda items to attain the highest possible level of health for all.",

The Plenary decides on certain important items such as adoption of the agenda and allocation of items to the Committees A and B. Since the Plenary is not a place to discuss technical and health issues, agenda items in the Plenary were excluded in our analysis. Then each agenda item in Committees A and B was considered as data for analysis.All agenda items in Committees A and B were labelled as Administrative Matters or Technical & Health Matters. We labelled the agenda items about financial, staffing, and legal matters, collaboration within the United Nations system, health conditions of the occupied Palestinian territory, and WHO organizational issues as Administrative Matters, regardless of whether they were in Committee A or B. Administrative Matters were analysed only quantitatively in this study. Other agenda items besides Administrative Matters were labelled as Technical & Health Matters. Then, we classified Technical & Health Matters into two groups: Health Matters and Progress Reports. Here, Progress Reports are follow-ups of the previous WHA agenda items, usually responding to the requests of previous resolutions adopted by the WHA in the past.
