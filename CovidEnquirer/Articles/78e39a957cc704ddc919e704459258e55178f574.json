It was not until 1957 that the epidemiology and viral aetiology were first described. 3 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main virus to cause bronchiolitis and is associated with over 75% of cases where a pathogen has been isolated. 4 Other viruses, including",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinoviruses are the commonest pathogens associated with these illnesses. Why some infants are severely affected, requiring admission to hospital, whilst others experience a simple cold is not fully understood: research has suggested that the innate immune response to these viruses is important. The innate immune system has many components and activation or deficiency in one or many areas may explain the different clinical presentations and disease severities that can occur in these infants. This review will summarize the recent evidence highlighting how RSV and rhinoviruses may modulate the innate immune response in both bronchiolitis and PSRW, and discuss how these illnesses affect the long-term development of the infant lung and the possible susceptibility to persistent airway disease. \u00df 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The classification of PSRW into different phenotypes has arisen as a result of studies investigating the relationship between PSRW and the development of asthma in later life. Four main phenotypes were determined in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study group. 18 This was a population-based cohort of >1000 infants enrolled at birth between 1980 and 1984 and followed-up by respiratory-based questionnaires for 18-20 years (at 2, 3, 6, 11, 13, 16 and 18 years), plus a review at 6 years to determine the markers of atopy, i.e. the presence of eczema, allergic rhinitis and allergy sensitization using skin prick testing.

Late-onset wheezers -infants who did not wheeze during the first 3 years but wheezed in the previous 12 months at age 6 years. 3. Persistent wheezers -infants who wheezed during the first 3 years and continued to wheeze in the previous 12 months at age 6 years. 19 4. Never wheezed -infants who had never wheezed in the first 6 years of life. Stein et al., in 1997 , investigated the differences between the Tucson-defined wheezing phenotypes and concentrations of circulating IgE at ages 6 and 11 years: for transient wheezers or late-onset wheezers there was no association between concentrations of circulating IgE at ages 6 and 11 years and later development of atopy, but there was an association for the persistent wheezers. 20 Recently the classification of wheezing phenotypes has been adapted. The ALSPAC group (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) has shown that the development of wheeze, especially in the first 3 years, is not as well defined as in the Tucson phenotypes. 21 The ALSPAC study 22 prospec-tively followed 14 541 infants who had an expected date of delivery between 01/04/1991 and 31/12/1992. Questionnaires on wheezing were sent to all parents regarding their children at 6, 18, 30, 42 and 81 months after birth. Each mother was asked whether their child had had any wheezing with whistling during the study periods 0-6, 6-18, 18-30, 30-42 and 69-81 months. Skin prick tests were performed at 7 years and lung function testing was performed at 8 years. Six wheezing phenotypes were determined (Fig. 1b These wheezing phenotypes have been used in several longitudinal birth cohorts to help determine the pathophysiology of PSRW.",

Wheeze rarely occurs in isolation in children and cough AE shortness of breath are also commonly found. A Danish study 24 investigated approximately 3000 children aged 5 years using a parental questionnaire addressing respiratory symptoms in the previous 12 months. It reported that during this time 19.4% had one episode of wheeze, 14.4% had more than one episode of wheeze and, of those with recurrent wheeze, 25.7% also had recurrent cough.

Viral-induced wheezing may require admission to hospital, but generally the illness is mild and symptoms resolve with age, so obtaining accurate information regarding the viral aetiology is difficult. In an Australian community-based cohort study, 25 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were taken from recruited infants (aged under 1 year) within 48 h of respiratory symptoms to investigate the viral aetiology of all acute respiratory infections identified over 1 year. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were subdivided into upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), and these were further subdivided into wheezing (wLRTIs) and non-wheezing phenotypes. NPAs were analysed using a panel of 17 respiratory viruses which included rhinovirus, picornoviruses (enterovirus, echovirus, coxsackie virus), coronavirus 229E and OC43, RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. There were 984 episodes of ARI in 263 recruited children; 5.9% of all children had no ARI but most infants had between two and five episodes (median 4, range 0-11 episodes). One-third (329 of 984; 33.4%) of the ARIs were LRTIs, with 95 of 329 LRTIs (28.9%) associated with wheeze. A virus was identified in 673 of the 984 episodes (69%), with 473 (48.5%) due to rhinovirus and 106 (10.9%) due to RSV. The other viruses each caused <55 episodes of ARI. Dual infections were identified in 101 of 673 (10.3%) and three viruses in six of 673 (0.6%). Rhinoviruses were the most commonly detected virus type in wLRTIs (45.3%) compared to 16.8% for RSV. The other viruses each contributed < 5% of the total wLRTIs. Only 17 of the 984 episodes required admission to hospital: in five of these 17 the pathogen was RSV and in three rhinovirus. This study demonstrates that in infants aged under 2 years, rhinovirus is an important cause of mild recurrent wheeze whereas RSV, while being less common, may account for more severe disease. Rhinovirus is also important in older ",

It enrolled 289 newborns with at least one parent with respiratory allergies and/or a history of asthma from November 1998 to May 2000 and followed them for 1-3 years. All infants had nasopharyngeal mucus samples collected during clinic visits at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months and during times of acute respiratory illness. These were analysed for RSV, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-4, adenovirus and picornavirus. In the third year of life, there were 180 wheezy illness episodes among 76 infants, with a virus identified in 62%. The rates of detection of the individual viruses were comparable to other studies, with most illness episodes due to rhinovirus (76 of 180; 42%) and each of the other viruses contributing significantly fewer (RSV 8.5%, parainfluenza 8%, adenovirus 1%, influenza 1%, rhinovirus 1%, picornavirus 0.5%). Wheezing due to rhinovirus during the first year was the strongest single predictor of subsequent third-year wheezing, with 63% of infants with wheezing due to rhinovirus infection in the first year continuing to wheeze in years 1-3 compared to 20% with wheezing in the first year due to other viruses (OR 6.6). 27 For all viral aetiologies there was a direct association between severity of respiratory illness in the first year (especially if associated with wheezing) and subsequent year 3 wheezing. However, frequency of respiratory illnesses in the first year did not predict wheezing at 3 years. This suggests that the strongest predictor of PSRW is a severe wheezing illness with rhinovirus in the first year of life. Other risk factors for recurrent wheezing in infants include prematurity, birthweight <2nd or >99th centile, family history of atopy, male gender, overcrowding, older siblings, attending day care, maternal smoking (especially during pregnancy) and reduced lung function at 2 weeks of age.",

Data from the Tucson Birth Cohort 38 have shown that lung function in early adulthood, measured at a mean of 10.9 years, 16.8 years and 21.7 years, could be predicted by maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (Vmax FRC ) in infancy (mean 2.3 months). Infants in the lowest percentile quarter for Vmax FRC had lower FEV 1 / FVC ratio, FEF and FEV 1 up to the age of 22 years, even after adjustment for height, weight, age and sex, than those in the upper three quartiles. Over the following years the rate of decline in FEV 1 to early adulthood was greater for those infants who had had viral-induced wheeze than for those with wheeze suggestive of asthma or those without any respiratory symptoms. 39 These observations may be accounted for in a number of ways. It may be that both early and later symptom complexes (including asthma) are manifestations of the same airways abnormality or disease. Early onset may either be a result of environmental factors or predisposition due to inherent susceptibility. This is slightly different from the hypothesis that, although the airways disorder/disease is the same at all ages, viral infections at this age in high-risk individuals present as wheezing disorders, i.e. RSV infection in a predisposed infant will cause bronchiolitis but in a lower risk infant will cause an upper respiratory tract infection alone. A very different explanation for these findings is that the events associated with early-onset illness cause either airway damage and remodelling of the lung and/or modulate the immune response to viruses and that these changes lead to later airway disease. Unravelling these mechanisms is currently the focus of a number of research groups worldwide.",

In vitro and animal models suggest that viral infections have to occur in a critical time period in a susceptible infant to increase their risk of developing asthma in early childhood. Although the association between bronchiolitis, PSRW, asthma and chronic respiratory disease is still not fully elucidated, respiratory viruses appear to play a key role. We will now consider what part the innate immune response to these viruses, as the host's first line of defence to these pathogens in the lung, plays in these diseases.",

Research has shown that an over-exuberant response or deficiency in these areas due either to a constitutive abnormality or as a result of the infecting virus itself, may explain the development of severe respiratory disease in some. It may also explain why many of these infants subsequently develop recurrent wheezing and obstructive lung disease/asthma in later life.

RSV prevents AEC from apoptosis by downregulating the tumour suppressor gene p53, which normally inhibits cell regulation. This causes prolonged survival of airway epithelial cells (AECs) and allows continuing viral replication. 44 AECs are also thought to be the site of primary infection for rhinoviruses and studies have shown that rhinovirus can induce increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules.

They also have an immune suppressor effect in both the innate and adaptive immune responses to dampen down excess inflammation. Once macrophages are recruited into the lung in bronchiolitis, there is activation of the NF-kb 48 pathway, resulting in the production of proinflammatory mediators -tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, CXCL-6 and CXCL-12. In mice depleted of alveolar macrophages and then exposed to RSV there was significantly less release of inflammatory mediators and activation and recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells into the airways. However, there was little change in adaptive immune responses or long-term outcome. 49 Alveolar macrophage effects are specifically caused when the RSV F protein binds to macrophages via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). 50 TLR-4, as part of the universal pattern recognition system, is found on all mammalian cells, although the exact interaction between RSV and TLRs has not been clarified for all cell types. RSV infection also upregulates the expression of TLR-3 in macrophages and causes them to produce chemokines such as CCL-5. 51 In vitro work has shown that rhinovirus can infect macrophages. 52 Although only a small proportion of macrophages supported viral replication, infection-induced TNF-a release had a time-and dose-dependent effect. This effect in macrophages, like for RSV, was dependent on activation of the NF-kb pathway.",

This shows that, although DCs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both bronchiolitis and PSRW, their response is virus specific. 55 The plasmocytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a specialized subset of DCs found in the circulating blood and peripheral lymph tissue. They are the major source of interferon (IFN)-a and -b production upon stimulation by virus or bacteria. IFNs play a pivotal role in inhibiting viral replication. RSV infection of pDCs has been shown to inhibit host IFN production and decrease the capacity of pDCs to activate na\u00efve T cells, resulting in low levels of Tcell proliferation and impaired cytokine production. 56 Compared to other viruses, RSV is a poor inducer of IFN-a/-b and is thus more resistant to antiviral effects. These effects are mediated via the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 of RSV which antagonize these antiviral IFNinduced responses. 57",

When RSV-infected mice were depleted of NK cells, they had prolonged shedding of the virus, showing that NK cells are important in viral clearance. 60 The response to RSV was evaluated in older mice who showed diminished NK cell activity and cytotoxic T-cell response, demonstrating that age-related or acquired immune dysfunction in the NK pathway leads to a more severe response to infection. 58 Clinical studies of NK cells are difficult due to the problems in isolating them.

In a mouse study 73 comparing wild-type and IFN-g-deficient mice, IFN-g production in the former during initial infection prevented re-infection with RSV and subsequent development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, unlike in the IFN-gdeficient mice. 73 The COAST study 74 looked at the innate immune system at birth and followed the infant cohort through to 3 years of age to see if any abnormalities were predictive of subsequent respiratory disease. There was an inverse relationship between neonatal cord blood phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced IFN-g responses and the number of moderate and severe viral infections per year. Vigorous secretion of IFN-g in the cord blood was associated with fewer viral infections in the first three years of life. There was no association with other PHA-induced responses, including CXCL-5, CXCL-10 and CXCL-13.

At 6 years of age they found an association between having had detectable concentrations of CXCL-4 and IFN-a at birth in cord blood and lower risk of physician-diagnosed asthma (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.37-0.99) and current wheeze (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.93). In this cohort, lower production of CXCL-4 and IFN-a in the fetoplacental unit increased the susceptibility to PSRW/asthma.",

In 11 of the 13 studies where cases were hospitalized, i.e. moderate to severe bronchiolitis, they found a strong association between bronchiolitis in infancy and subsequent development of wheezing. Semple and Smyth 29 reviewed the literature in 2006 and found five additional studies published since the Bont review, again showing the same association. In 2007, a systematic review by Perez-Yarza et al.30 investigated whether RSV respiratory infections in the first 36 months of life were associated with the development of episodes of recurrent wheezing/asthma.
