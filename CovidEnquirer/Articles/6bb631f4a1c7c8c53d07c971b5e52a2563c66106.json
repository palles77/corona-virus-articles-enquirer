Immunohistochemical staining identified C. pecorum positive reactions in the jejunal villi. C. pecorum, designated 24-100, was isolated from the feces of a calf with diarrhea in another farm in Yamaguchi Prefecture in 2012. A significant increase in neutralizing antibody titers against C. pecorum was confirmed in paired sera. Nucleotide sequence identities of omp1 genes of the 2 isolates were 100%. The isolates were genetically and antigenically more closely related to C. pecorum Bo/Yokohama strain isolated from cattle with enteritis in Japan than to the other prototype strains, Bo/Maeda isolated from cattle with pneumonia and Ov/ IPA isolated from sheep with polyarthritis. These results indicate that C. pecorum strains similar to 22-58 and 24-100 might be endemic in Yamaguchi Prefecture and cause enteric disease in cattle.",

            "text": "Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular bacteria that have a unique developmental cycle which includes morphological changes. They cause a wide range of diseases in animals and humans [20, 21] . The most important mode of transmission is thought to be fecal shedding by carrier animals. Chlamydiae may be shed in vaginal, ocular and nasal discharges, uterine fluid, placental tissue, urine and semen. Chlamydial infection can be acquired by direct contact between animals or by indirect transmission, such as the fecal-oral route or via inhalation of contaminated air [18] . Clarkson et al. [4] reported that Chlamydia was isolated from lamb's feces on 26 farms in England and Wales, and the prevalence of infection varied from 5-50% on individual farms. Isolates were identified as enteric type rather than abortion type and thus were classified as Chlamydia pecorum rather than Chlamydia psittaci. In cattle, C. pecorum is known to cause encephalomyelitis, pneumonia and enteritis, but subclinical and persistent infections are more common [8] . DeGraves et al. [5] reported that low-level of C. psittaci and C. pecorum genital infections was detected in 53% of virgin heifers by quantitative PCR, suggesting predominantly extra-genital transmission of Chlamydia in cattle. Reinhold et al. [17] reported that natural infections with Chlamydia spp. in calves were associated with subclinical chronic effects on animal health. Recently, it was reported that asymptomatic endemic C. pecorum infections reduced growth rates in calves by up to 48% [16] . However, the pathogenesis of C. pecorum is still unclear. In Japan, there are only a few reports of C. pecorum strains isolated from affected cattle [6] [7] [8] .",

After centrifugation of the 10% homogenate, the supernatant was filtered through a 450 nm membrane (Merck Millipore Ltd., Carrigtwohill, Ireland), and 0.15 ml of the supernatants were inoculated onto hamster lung (HmLu-1) cells, Mardin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, bovine testicular (BT) cells, human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18) cells and Vero cells in 24-well plates. After adsorption for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, the cells were washed with MEM, and then, 0.5 ml of MEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Bovogen Biologicals, Williams Avenue, Australia) was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, and cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed. After incubation for 10 days, cells were frozen and thawed once and then centrifuged. Subsequent passages were carried out at least twice in the same manner with 0.15 ml of the supernatant. Gimenez stain was used to identify CPE. DHL Agar, Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood and GAM agar with 5% yolk and 0.1% cysteine were used for bacterial isolation.

On the other hand, it is thought that C. pecorum causes asymptomatic infections [8] . Recently, Poudel et al. [16] reported that asymptomatic endemic C. pecorum infections reduce growth rates in calves by up to 48%. They considered that the mechanism of growth suppression by subclinical chlamydial infection was malabsorption of nutrients due to a local inflammatory response to intestinal mucosal infection. Additionally, despite the absence of clinical signs, chla- mydial infection was associated with reduced serum iron concentrations and lower hematocrit values, and infected calves were leukopenic [17] . Mohamad and Rodolakis [15] reported that the persistence of C. pecorum strains in the intestines and vaginal mucus of ruminants could cause longterm sub-clinical infection which may affect the animal's health. This may explain the poor weight gain observed in case 2 after recovery from diarrhea. Further studies on the pathogenesis of C. pecorum infections are required.",
