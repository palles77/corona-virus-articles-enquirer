Annual epidemics of hPIV-3 infection are responsible for considerable economic losses as a result of hospitalization, medication costs, work and school absence, and mortality. However, PIV infections have been less well studied compared to RSV and influenza viral infections. In the present study, PIV was associated with 10.00% of all the RTI hospitalizations and 15.00% of the RTI in outpatient children. A study in the USA found PIV infections to be associated with 11.50% of all pediatric RTI hospitalizations. 32 Human bocavirus (HBoV) was first reported by Allander et al. in 2005. 33 Subsequently, HBoV was reported in respiratory specimens collected from different countries and regions worldwide, [34] [35] [36] and detected in 1.50% to 8.30% of respiratory specimens from individuals with acute RTI, especially young children and infants. In the present study, HBoV was detected in 3.85% of all children <2 years old, who provided 78.33% of all the HBoV-positive specimens. HBoV infection has recently attracted attention worldwide. However, the incidence and clinical presentation of this infection varies widely, often involving co-infection with other potential pathogens. 37 Such characteristics have led to debate over the role of HBoV as a true pathogen. In the present study, among the 180 HBoV-positive specimens, there were 66 (36.67%) co-infections with at least one other respiratory virus. Elderly people have also been reported to be susceptible to HBoV. A single lineage of HBoV was detected among a wide age distribution of patients with acute RTI. In this study, a total of 18 adult specimens were positive for HBoV. The virus has also been found in stool specimens from patients with gastrointestinal illness. 38, 39 Therefore, additional evidence and studies are needed throughout the world to gain a better understanding of this virus.",

The effect may depend upon which viruses co-infect. 44 In the present study, 3.39% of specimens had multiple or dual infections, with a predominance of Flu compared to the other co-viruses. However, in the positive specimens, the co-infection rates for HCoV and HBoV were higher than those of other respiratory viruses.

The symptoms included fever (39.5 8C), cough, runny nose, and expectoration, with a diagnosis of bronchopneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were also detected. Co-infection viruses included Flu, RSV, HCoV, and HBoV, at rates of 52.17% (252/483), 50.52% (244/483), 39.03% (137/351), and 36.67% (66/180), respectively. Flu and RSV were frequently detected as co-infection viruses among the 483 co-infection specimens, accounting for 52.17% (252/483) and 50.52% (244/483), respectively. However, HCoV and HBoV were the pathogens preferring to co-infect with other respiratory viruses; 39.03% (137/351) of HCoV-positive samples and 36.67% (66/180) of HBoV-positive samples were found to contain other respiratory viruses. Most co-infected patients were male (66.05%, 319/483), inpatients (69.15%, 334/483), children <4 years old (67.07%, 324/483), and younger adults aged 20-35 years (12.84%, 62/483).

The rate of co-infection detection was 3.76% (319/8490) in male patients and 2.85% (164/5747) in female patients (Chi-square = 8.540, p = 0.003), and 2.03% (149/7323) in outpatients and 4.83% (334/6914) in inpatients (Chi-square = 84.833, p < 0.0001).",
