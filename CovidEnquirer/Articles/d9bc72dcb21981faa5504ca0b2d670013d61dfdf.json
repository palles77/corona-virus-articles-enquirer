Baseline characteristics, including pain scores, were similar in the 2 groups. Both treatment groups had a similar decrease in pain score in the ED. The mean rate of decrease in pain score with activity for indomethacin was \u03ea1.7\u03ee1.6 (SD) mm per day and for prednisolone was \u03ea2.9\u03ee2.0 (SD) mm per day (mean difference 1.2 mm/day; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.0 mm/day; P\u03ed.0026). Although these differences were statistically significant, at no time was the difference in mean pain score greater than 13 mm. Therefore, it is unclear whether these differences are clinically significant. The mean total dose of acetaminophen consumed by the prednisolone group was significantly more than in the indomethacin group (mean 10.3 g, range 1 to 21 g versus mean 6.4 g, range 1 to 21 g). Twenty-nine patients in the indomethacin group and 12 patients in the prednisolone group experienced adverse effects (P\u03fd.05). The commonest adverse effects in the indomethacin group were nausea, indigestion, epigastric pain, dizziness, and gastrointestinal bleeding (N\u03ed5; 11%). None of the patients in the prednisolone group developed gastrointestinal bleeding. The relapse rate for both groups was similar.",

It is the commonest cause of inflammatory joint disease in men older than 40 years. 1 It has been estimated that the overall prevalence in the United Kingdom is 10 per 1,000, with men affected more commonly than women. 2 The diagnosis of acute gout is typically made clinically by the presence of rapid onset of severe pain, swelling, and erythema of an affected joint and definitively by demonstrating the presence of negatively birefringent uric acid crystals in aspirated joint fluid. The diagnosis is often made in the absence of joint aspiration because this procedure is painful, poorly tolerated by some patients, and declined by others and is sometimes difficult or inconvenient to perform in a busy emergency department (ED). The treatment of such patients is inconsistent, and evidencebased guidelines to support clinical management are lacking. Gout is an increasingly prevalent condition worldwide and creates a heavy economic burden. 1, 3 Importance",

[13] [14] [15] Intraarticular corticosteroids may also be administered for monoarticular disease and intramuscular corticosteroids for podagra. 4 A few small controlled studies have compared oral NSAIDs with intraarticular or intramuscular steroids and suggest that NSAIDs are as effective as steroids in the treatment of acute gout. [16] [17] [18] However, NSAIDs have a significant rate of adverse effects, including gastric irritation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and renal failure. 4 Although steroids cause severe adverse events if taken at high doses for long periods, there appear to be few adverse effects if they are taken in low to moderate doses for short periods. 19 The gastrointestinal adverse effects also appear to be less severe than those of NSAIDs. 5 Long-term effects, such as osteoporosis and muscle wasting, are not relevant to acute gout treatment. Oral NSAIDs have not been compared to oral steroids in the management of acute gout.",

            "text": "Although NSAIDs have been recommended as the first-line therapy for acute gouty arthritis, 25 there have been some studies on the role of steroid in the treatment of the condition. In a small preliminary study, it was suggested that a short course of oral corticosteroid therapy could be used effectively for acute gout when NSAIDs are contraindicated. 16 Subsequently, in another small study of 27 patients, single intramuscular injections of betamethasone, intravenous methylprednisolone, or oral diclofenac resulted in prompt and equal improvement. 26 Glucocorticoid therapy was well tolerated. The sample size was small, adverse effects were not reported, and oral corticosteroids were not used. In another small study (27 patients) , the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular triamcinolone in the treatment of acute gout were also noted. 27 A review article by Kim et al 1 reported that therapies available for managing acute gout, which included corticotropin, corticosteroids, colchicines, and NSAIDs, were associated with significant adverse events. However, in our study, we found that there were no cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the group treated with prednisolone, whereas 5 (11%) patients in the indomethacin group developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although none of the patients died because of the adverse effects, the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in the elderly, is a cause of significant morbidity. [9] [10] [11] [12] The pain score at rest and during activity followed a similar pattern and trend of improvement in both the prednisolone and indomethacin groups. However, patients in the prednisolone group used slightly more acetaminophen, suggesting that prednisolone alone may not be enough to relieve the pain associated with the disease. Studies that compared cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors with NSAIDs found that the former had a similar comparable efficacy but better tolerability. [28] [29] [30] However, COX-2 inhibitors are expensive and are less accessible to the general population. Even more important is the concern about the cardiovascular safety of COX-2 inhibitors. 28, 31, 32 The use of corticosteroids in the treatment of acute gout has also been known to be effective. Corticosteroids have been used clinically in the treatment of a large variety of conditions, ranging from allergic or ectopic diseases, asthma, and connective tissue diseases to other inflammatory conditions.",

Physicians have more experience with NSAIDs in the treatment of gout. In addition, corticosteroids have received bad publicity in terms of their numerous long-term adverse effects such as Cushing syndrome, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The recent report of avascular necrosis after use of high-dose methylprednisolone in the treatment severe acute respiratory syndrome is another vivid example. 33 Our results are in line with epidemiologic reports that acute gouty arthritis most commonly affects elderly patients and that the risk of serious gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDs is higher in this age group. 8 According to the findings in our study, we recommend that moderate doses of oral prednisolone supplemented with oral acetaminophen be considered as first-line therapy in the treatment of acute gout.",
