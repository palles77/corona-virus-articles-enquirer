Both scenarios could endanger life and safety of the buildings occupants. Equipping buildings with appropriate chemical sensors can alert the building occupants about the contaminant release. The readings of these sensors can be employed to trace the location of release, and help to take the appropriate actions to minimize the casualties. However, only a limited number of them can be installed due to their initial and operating cost. Moreover, there is no information about the source strength, release time and possible source location. This paper reports the development of a methodology to identify the source location using sensors reading from limited locations. The methodology uses the artificial neural network (ANN) as a statistical analysis integrated with a multi-zone airborne contaminant transport model, CONTAM. To evaluate the applicability of this method, the contaminant dispersion within a building was modeled and the results were integrated to an ANN for the source identification. The prediction made by the trained ANN was then evaluated by predicting the source of the contaminant in 40 extra cases, which had not been seen by the network during the training session. The model was able to predict the source location in more than 90% of the cases when the building was monitored by three or more sensors. The results show that the method can be used to help building designers decide the optimum configuration of the sensors required for a space based on the accuracy level of the source detection.",

Spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing in 2003, and the release of nerve agent Sarin in Tokyo metro station in 1995 were such incidents caused by a sudden release of a chemical or biological agent inside an enclosed space. Superstructures, shopping centers or high-rise buildings, with a total floor space of over hundred thousand are becoming part of new cities' landscapes. These buildings are normally accommodating several thousand occupants. Sudden intentional or accidental release of a chemical agent inside such buildings endangers the lives of its occupants. To mitigate the casualty caused by these scenarios, the protection level of the buildings needs to be increased. There are a number of options which building owners and managers have in order to increase the protection level inside the enclosed environment [14] . Equipping buildings with appropriate sensors is a logical approach to enhance the safety and security of building occupants. A sensor or a combination of them can be used to monitor the concentration level of a contaminant and warn the air quality deterioration. Moreover, the information obtained by these sensors can be applied to locate the source of the contaminant in case of an incident. Having the knowledge of the source location is required to take an appropriate action such as evacuating the building, shutting down the ventilation system, or moving the occupants to a designated shelter when the building is contaminated with a toxic gas. However, these sensors are very expensive and bulky, which limits the number of them that could be employed in a building to measure the contaminant concentration level in the entire enclosed space. Thus, the main challenge is to locate the source of a contaminant within a building using a limited number of sensors, while these readings may vary when the unknown source is located rather near or far away from the sensor. Meanwhile, the unknown source released time and source strength create an uncertainty in understanding the actual source location.",

A number of airflow models such as the computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the zonal model and the multi-zone model were developed to study the distribution of a contaminant concentration and other airflow parameters inside a space. To characterize contaminant dispersion inside a building, each airflow model requires initial and boundary conditions as input parameters. Thus, in the case where there is a source of a contaminant inside the indoor environment, the source location, as well as its release time and strength, are needed to be specified in the forward simulation to have the complete information about contaminant distribution. In source identification problems, however, the contaminant concentrations measured by the sensors are known as the consequence of an unknown causal. Herein, the distribution of contaminant concentration needs to be integrated with an inverse analysis yield to source location identification.",

Furthermore, the outdoor weather conditions, such as wind speed and direction, and the building ventilation operation influence the contaminant distribution within the building. Thus, the mentioned parameters are understood as the effective factors on the distribution profile of a contaminant and consequently, on the mounted sensors' readings. Although changing these parameters may result in a different contaminant distribution pattern, it is possible to have the same concentration distributions which could result from different combination of these factors. For instance, a contaminant source releases M 1 (kg) of a contaminant in t 1 (s) earlier in a location could have the same contaminant distribution profile as another source releases M 2 (kg) of the same contaminant in t 2 (s) earlier in another location. Therefore, there is an uncertainty in identifying (tracking back) the source location from the sensors' readings. This uncertainty is the main problem in the inverse analysis. To overcome this problem, a number of methods have been developed.",

Here, they used quasi-reversibility (QR) method which solves the specie mass conservation equation with reversed time-step. In addition to reversing the time-step, the diffusion term in the governing equation was replaced by a fourth-order stabilization term accompanied with a stabilization coefficient. Indeed, the governing equation is not understood as a mass conservation equation anymore. Zhang and Chen [21] applied QR method to find the source of a contaminant in an aircraft cabin and an office building. They showed that the method could be used to locate the source in the aircraft with a good accuracy, while the result was more dispersive and less accurate in the case of the office building. They inferred that the replacement of the diffusion term had a negative effect in locating the source in office building with low Reynolds number.",

Herein, the reverse simulation needs to be conducted from the time that the sensor is detecting the contaminant back to the time that the contaminant was released. However, the release time of the contaminant is unknown in practice and depends on the type of the contaminant, its threshold limit to activate the alarm, the source location and its strength. Moreover, the accurate knowledge of the boundary conditions and their changes during the time is important to identify the amount of the contaminant, which left the domain after release. Therefore, the method needs a prior knowledge of the source activation time or the contaminant transport time to predict the source location. In addition, they used contaminant concentration distribution in the entire geometry as the initial condition for their model, which hardly can be achieved in a real scenario due to the limited number of sensors. To overcome this drawback, they studied the source characterization by single sensor [22] . For this purpose, they employed the QR method and added a nominal source term in the sensor's location. The nominal source was used to find the distribution of backward location probability density function. Therefore, the location with the highest probability depicts the source location. They examined the proposed method in an aircraft with a single source of a contaminant. Moreover, they compared the QR method with another inverse model called pseudo-reversibility (PR) method. In PR method, the time is kept as forward, but the flow direction, instead, is reversed and the diffusion term is eliminated from the governing equation. As an input to their model, they used the peakconcentration measured by the sensor and the time required for the concentration to reach its peak value. Indeed, they assumed that the sensor continuously monitors the air, and it can provide the peak-concentration and the concentration profile. However, the peak-concentration is a function of the source location and its strength which are unknown. Thus, the method needs a prior knowledge of one of the source parameters to find the source location.",

In addition, they developed a probabilistic method to locate the source indoors. The method was adopted based on the adjoint probability method initially introduced by Neupauer and Wilson [12, 13] to track a source of a contaminant in a groundwater. Liu and Zhai [7] modified and implemented the adjoint probability method for both CFD and multi-zone models to identify the contaminant source location inside an enclosed environment. The application of the CFD-based adjoint backward location probability was tested for two cases; an office building, 2-D, and an aircraft cabin, 3-D [8] . The inverse modeling was conducted with a known contaminant release time. The model showed an acceptable accuracy in predicting the contaminant source location. However, the work needs to be improved to identify the contaminant sources with both unknown location and release time. In addition, running a CFD program cannot give a fast real-time result, which is vital in an emergency situation. Hence, Liu and Zhai [9] developed the multi-zone-based adjoint probability method. The method was implemented to locate a source of a contaminant with either a single or multiple sensors and with either alarm only sensor or concentration reading sensor. Nevertheless, the method requires the knowledge of exact source activation time, which is not available in real life scenario.",

The proposed framework has two stages; pre-event stage and present stage. In the pre-event stage, all plausible source parameters are considered to conduct the airflow and contaminant dispersion simulation in a building. These simulations can be carried out by an airflow model, and the results are stored in a library. Each simulation corresponds to a ventilation system status, contaminant source status, contaminant species and overall, a contaminant release scenario. This stage is performed before the event. During an emergency incident, the second stage (present stage) is carried out to interpret the data obtained by the sensors and identifying the nearest matched simulation results with the measurements. For this purpose, they used Bayesian probabilistic method to compare each simulation result in the library with the measured data and assess the likelihood described by pre-simulated data. The simulation with the highest likelihood is accepted as the possible scenario for the investigated system. Thus, the inputs (source parameters) for that specific simulation are realized as the causal for the measured concentrations in sensors' locations. This approach shows a fast real-time identification of a pollutant source without considering any prior knowledge of some source's parameters. However, the main problem is the huge number of the required forward presimulations. To prepare a complete library of simulations, all plausible combinations of the causal parameters are required to be considered. The variety of these parameters depends on the degree of complexity of the system. As the character of the transport phenomena in an enclosed space is inherently complicated, this inverse technique demands lots of pre-simulations, which may fail to consider some possible combinations of causal parameters yet.",

[2] applied ANN to predict hourly SO 2 concentration in a polluted area in Slovenia. Hasham et al. [6] established an ANN to predict hourly concentration of NO x in Edmonton, Canada. They studied the effect of meteorological data, traffic, and industrial emission on the concentration of this component. The result shows a good forecasting ability of ANN. The application of ANN was not only limited to the outdoor environment. In indoor application, the airflow models were replaced by ANN which was integrated with an optimization algorithm to optimize the energy consumption inside the office buildings [23, 24, 10] . Vukovic and Srebric [18] applied ANN to find a source of a contaminant in a building by training a separate neural network (NN) for each separate zone of the building. Each zone was monitored by a sensor which measured transient concentration of the contaminant as the inputs of the NN assigned to that zone. To identify the source location, the distance between the NN's prediction and the zone which that particular NN was assigned to was calculated, and then the zone which had the NN with the smallest error was recognized as the source location. Although they introduced an effective approach in source identification procedure, monitoring all building zones with sensors was not realistic. In addition, by having knowledge of the transient concentration of a contaminant in all zones the source would be clearly in the zone with the sudden change in concentration occurs and there is no need for additional analysis. Vukovic et al. [19] improved their work to detect the source location using limited number of sensors. They replaced the transient concentration of the contaminant in each zone with an exponential equation accompanied by three coefficients. Three consecutive readings of the sensor were used to calculate the coefficients of the equation, which were used as the NN inputs instead of the sensor's readings. While the method could find the source of contaminant with unknown source parameters, the detection is only limited to the cases in which the source is not located in sensors' zones. Their suggested equation cannot present the trend of the transient concentration in source location, and consequently the coefficient of the equation of the released zone cannot be calculated. In other words, they assumed that the source is not located in the zones which are monitored by a sensor.",

Generally, an ANN consists of a number of layers, which include a number of neurons. The first layer and the last one are called input and output layers, respectively. In addition, there can be one or multi-layer between the first and last layers which are known as hidden layers. In an ANN with feed forward structure, the neurons of each layer are connected to the neurons in adjacent layers. The connection between these neurons is called weight, and the magnitude of the weights represents the strength of the connection. Based on the architecture of ANN, the inputs of neurons in the current layer are transferred to the connected neurons in the next layer. For this purpose, the input of each neuron is multiplied by the weight of the connection and summed with the other neurons in the same layer. Then, the summation is passed to the transfer function to calculate the output which is recognized as the input of the neuron in the next layer. This procedure is explained mathematically as follows:",

Two facades of this flat are guarded by two climatic chambers (Fig. 1) to have a controlled environment. The temperature in these two chambers can be varied between \u00c010 C and 30 C while the relative humidity may be set from 30% to 80%. Moreover, the pressure drop between these two fa\u00e7ades can reach up to 200 Pa, which is equivalent to a wind velocity of 70 km/h [1] . The other facades are kept in the same conditions as indoors. Haghighat and Li [5] simulated the inter-zonal airflow inside OPTIBAT and validated their simulation with measured data. The measurement was done with fan pressurization test, and for both summer and winter conditions, which were imposed by the climatic chambers. This study adopts their simulation for summer conditions as the validated baseline to create the required database to train the ANN for source identification purpose.

As discussed before, the input of each neuron is multiplied by the weight which provides the connection between two neurons and then summed with the output of the other neurons on the same layer. This summation has to be transferred to the neuron on the next layer by utilizing a transfer function.

This procedure effectively trains the network to predict the results when it is faced with new input data of interest. \"Back-propagation\" is a well known supervised training algorithm consisting of two steps [15] . In the first step, the inputs are propagated forward to calculate the outputs and error of the network. Weights, biases and transfer functions perform the major roll in this forward section. In the second step, the error is propagated backward to change the weights and biases yield to appropriate magnitudes of the weights to achieve the least error. Gradient descent is the approach adopted to get to the least error in back-propagation learning technique [3] . Essentially, the trained network must have generalization capability to foresee the results of unseen inputs and avoid the over-fitting problem. \"Early stopping\" is a common generalization method adopted in training procedure [11] . Herein, the early stopping training is implemented in conjunction with a LevenbergeMarquardt back-propagation training function in MATLAB. It is a method to check the generalization of the network. In this technique, the training database is categorized in three subsets; training subset, validation subset and testing subset [11] . While the primary subset is used to determining the best weights and biases, the validation subset is monitored by training algorithm to avoid over-fitting problem. When the error associated with this subset is increasing continuously the training is stopped and the weights and biases of the minimum validation error are re-adopted [11] . The error associated with the testing subset is monitored for further check on the generalization capability of the network. However, this error does not have any impact on the training procedure. In this study 70% of the available data is randomly assigned to the training subset. Validation and testing subsets consist of 20% and 10% of the rest of the data, respectively.",

Although the locations of the sensors are crucial in fast detection of a contaminant, this study does not plan to find the optimum location of the sensors. Its aim is to develop a method to find the source of release without knowing its parameters (location, time and strength) and validate the applicability of this procedure. Therefore, it was assumed that the building is monitored by three sensors located in zone-1, zone-4 and zone-6, respectively. Indeed, the selection of the sensors' locations is reasonable regarding the airflow movement in this building. The air is infiltrated through the first three zones, moves to zone-4 and finally ex-filtrated from the last two zones. Thus, the selected configuration of the sensors' network has the ability to provide information about the contaminant concentration. Following the training procedure presented in Fig. 3 , the contaminant concentrations in sensors' locations were determined and set as the inputs to the ANN while the corresponding source location was set as the output of the network for training purpose. The convergence of the training algorithm was checked based on two criteria. The first one is the training performance evaluated by the mean square error (MSE) associated with the prediction of the network for the data categorized as the training subset. When the MSE stabilized over Fig. 4 . Training performance graph for three sensors. certain iterations (epochs), the algorithm was considered to reach its convergence. The second criterion was imposed by the training function to satisfy the generalization of the trained network. As mentioned earlier, the \"early stopping\" was adopted in this study and it was obliged by the algorithm when the MSE of the validation subset did not reduce over 100 epochs. Fig. 4 shows the MSE graph of three subsets utilized for training the ANN with three sensors inside the building. The MSE of the training subset dropped less than 0.04 and the MSE of the validation subset did not reduce than 0.08 over 100 epochs. Also, the validation and testing curves were very similar which one can conclude that there was no possibility of over fitting. The training process converged in 248 epochs and it took one minute on a dual-processor Pentium IV workstation (Dell Precision 380) with CPU 3.4 GHz.",

Therefore, the accuracy of the prediction of those extra cases implies the functionality of the method in real applications. These 40 extra cases are considered as the possible incidents occurred inside the building. In those incidents, the source parameters are assumed to be unknown and the only available information is the sensors' readings when one of them is alarming the situation with over threshold limit concentration. However, these source parameters are given to the CONTAM model to determine the sensors' readings in those incidents. The released masses and the corresponding release time and source-zone are selected randomly for those extra scenarios, and the contaminant concentrations in the sensor zones are calculated at the corresponding release time. Afterward, these concentrations are given to the trained ANN and the prediction of the network is compared with the actual source location. Fig. 5 presents the ANN prediction of the extra cases. Also, the source parameters and the relative error of the prediction for those cases are tabulated in Table 1 .",

            "text": "During the training and testing procedure, the source-zone was introduced to the network as the nominal source number AE 0.5. Indeed, the multi-zone model assumes that the air is fully mixed and the whole zone has a uniform concentration. Therefore, the area of each zone was normalized as one unit and the range of AE0.5 was considered for each zone to cover total area of the zone containing the contaminant source. Regarding this definition, the trained ANN could detect the source of contaminant in 90% of the unseen cases (36 out of 40). Moreover, the mean average error of the prediction was 8.49%, the median of the errors was 2.82% and the first and third quartiles were 0.90% and 8.83%, respectively. Obviously, the trained network had a significant accuracy in predicting the source location without knowing the source parameters and the history of contaminant concentration from the release time. The main deviation from the accurate source detection was seen for the cases with low released mass magnitude. Cases 5, 15, 19 had source strength less than 15 unit and the network could not correctly predict the source-zone. This failing attributes to the inaccuracy associated with ANN to predict the target which its inputs have magnitude near the constraints of their range. ANN can only be used for interpolation and its accuracy is negatively affected when the magnitude of the inputs is near the lower bound of its range. Generating contaminant with low strength results in a low concentration level in sensors' locations and may create a significant discrepancy in interpolating to the target value. Nevertheless, the sources located in zone-5 were all identified correctly even with low released mass (case 28 and case 34). The contaminant generated by the sources located in this zone can only be seen by the sensor located in zone-6 and the first two sensors show zero Table 2 The effect of the number of sensors on the source detection. concentration. Therefore, the network learns when the magnitude of the first two inputs is zero, the source may be in zone-5 or zone-6 and the system has less complexity to be mapped. Overall, the method could find the source location with a good accuracy and regardless of its location whether it was located in sensors' zone or in adjacent zones. Furthermore, the effect of the number of sensors was evaluated on the accuracy of the ANN prediction. Indeed, the number of sensors is equal to the number of inputs to the ANN and the higher number of the sensors results in more input information to the ANN. However, these sensors are very bulky and expensive and utilizing the minimum number of them would highly be desired, while the occupants' safety should not be sacrificed. Therefore, to quantify the effect of sensor's number on the prediction, the ANN was trained and evaluated for five situations which consider the building monitored with two to six sensors. Moreover, the trained ANN was evaluated for source identification for the same 40 extra cases presented in Table 1 . Table 2 shows those five situations with their mean average error of source prediction and the number of cases in which the source was located correctly. It was observed that the mean average error was reduced as more sensors were installed. Moreover, similar to the case with three sensors, the source in case 15 could not be identified in other situations which attributes to the inaccuracy associated with ANN to predict the target which its inputs have magnitude near the lower bound of its range.",

Thus, the application of ANN was proposed to map this relation and its capability to find the contaminant source was evaluated for a simple scenario which deals with an incidental release of a contaminant in a one-story building. CONTAM multi-zone model was employed to analyze the airflow profile and contaminant dispersion inside that building.
