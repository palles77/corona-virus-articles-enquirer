Using transcriptomics, important advances were 57 also possible in the field of RNA biology 3,4 that shaped our understanding of the transcriptional 58 landscape 5,6 and RNA-mediated regulatory processes in prokaryotes 7 .

            "text": "highly accurate yet short sequencing reads (commonly 100-300 bp). Hence, sequence information 62 is only available in a fragmented form, making full-length transcript-or isoform-detection a 63 challenging task 9,10 . Sequencing platforms developed by Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) and Oxford 64 Nanopore Technologies (ONT) solved this issue. Both sequencing methods are bona fide single-65 molecule sequencing techniques that allow sequencing of long DNAs or RNAs 11,12 . However, the 66 base detection differs significantly between the two methods. PacBio-sequencers rely on 67 fluorescence-based single-molecule detection that identifies bases based on the unique fluorescent 68 signal of each nucleotide during DNA synthesis by a dedicated polymerase 11 . In contrast, in an ONT 69 sequencer, the DNA or RNA molecule is pushed through a membrane-bound biological pore with 70 the aid of a motor protein that is attached to the pore protein called a nanopore (Fig. 1a) . A change 71 in current is caused by the translocation of the DNA or RNA strand through this nanopore, which 72 serves as a readout signal for the sequencing process. Due to the length of the nanopore (version 73 R9.4), a stretch of approximately five bases contributes to the current signal. Notably, only ONT 74 transcriptomes 19,21-23 and to detect RNA isoforms in eukaryotes 24, 25 . However, prokaryotic 82 transcriptomes have not been characterized on the genome-wide level by native RNA-seq 83 approaches so far as prokaryotic RNAs lack a poly(A) tail which is required to capture the RNA and 84 feed it into the nanopore. 85",

Therefore, we assume that not Nanopore sequencing but library preparation 467 causes this problem. Based on this information, we developed a strategy that first collapses all 468 overlapping reads and then splits them according to a significant coverage drop on the 3\u00b4 ends 469 (annotation of TUs based on this strategy in Supplementary Table 5) . We compared the results to 470 database annotations and found that most of the differences are either caused by the low 471 sequencing depth or by single-unit operons that have been collapsed and are now two-unit 472 operons in the ONT data sets (see Supplementary Fig. 10a,b) 29,50 . Even though limited read 473 availability is a concern in all data sets, many large operons were detected for all organisms (see 474 Supplementary Fig. 10c ). In case of limited bioinformatical resources, TUs can be explored visually 475 in a genome browser, which is mostly not possible for Illumina reads (Fig. 3 , see Supplementary 476 Fig. 11,12) . It further allows a quantitative analysis of individual transcripts in relation to other 477 elements of the TU and performs much better than pure bioinformatical prediction or molecular 478 biology methods (RT-PCR) as shown for the archaellum operon in P. furiosus (Fig. 3) seq data, the analysis shows that this operon is split into two transcription units. This shows that 484 the ONT native RNA sequencing method provides the opportunity to correctly annotate 485 transcriptional units thereby outperforming the bioinformatics-only prediction as well as the 486 visual inspection of Illumina coverage (see Supplementary Fig. 11) . Besides, we confirmed the 487 complex transcription pattern of the major ribosomal protein gene cluster in E. coli that stretches 488 over more than 10 kB, including the accurate determination of TSS and TTS and a putative cleavage 489 site in the secY gene (see Supplementary Fig. 12) 63 . 490 the author/funder.

The analysis further revealed a reduced signal variability at non-modified 589 positions between the two samples in comparison to the theoretical distribution, which leads to 590 less false positives in the statistical analysis. As the de novo model has a higher error rate 591 compared to the sample-compare model, we generated two read sets by sorting full-length 16S 592 rRNA transcripts according to their 5\u00b4 leading length to mature (n: 2744) and pre-rRNAs (n: 102) 593 in the Haloferax wildtype data set (Fig. 6c) . The calculated base modification probabilities and 594 electric current signal distributions for this model are very similar to the wildtype/\u2206ksgA set, 595",

This 613 is for example seen when analysing the Pyrococcus data set, as the quality score is also based on 614 the comparison of detected to theoretical read signal (compare Supplementary Fig. 3c) . To look at 615 this observation in more detail, we compared the results from the raw squiggle Tombo approach 616 that is not dependent on mapping of the reads to the mapping properties of the reads. This 617 methodology is based on an approach that was recently used to identify m 6 A RNA modifications 618 from native RNA reads with an accuracy of ~90% 14 . After mapping, the frequency for the 619 respective nucleotide at every position in the 16S rRNA to be correct, wrong or deleted was 620 calculated. Homopolymer stretches in the RNA increase the likelihood that the correct number of 621 nucleotides is not correctly identified and this, in turn, leads to an increased number of deleted 622 nucleotides, which is also visible in the Haloferax data sets at the G-stretch adjacent to the m 6 2A 623 modifications ( Supplementary Fig, 16a,b) . The overall frequency of wrongly assigned and deleted 624 nucleotides was much higher in P. furiosus (16.4%) than in E. coli (10.7%) and H. volcanii (10.4%) 625 ( Supplementary Fig. 16c ).

A putative candidate is archaeal CPSF1 (aCPSF1), a recently 666 described archaeal termination factor 96 that is widespread in archaea. aCPSF1 acts as ribonuclease 667 that cleaves transcripts after a poly(U) stretch to trim transcripts and facilitates transcription 668 termination in Methanococcus maripaludis.

The control showed a 354 uniform length distribution (median lengths between 1212 and 1306 nucleotides) and a very good 355 read quality (median quality between 10.8 and 12.2) in all samples, therefore, excluding any bias 356 (seeSupplementary Fig. 2b,c, Supplementary",

Sources for bias could emerge (i) from 381 the poly(A)-tailing efficiency that might differ between transcripts and (ii) from the loss of certain 382 transcripts during library preparation or sequencing problems. Comparing the initial amount of 383 RNA with the reverse transcribed DNA, we observed that the enzymatic addition of a 3\u00b4 poly(A)-384 tail is not very efficient (~10%). In general, the addition of poly(A)20 (length of the reverse 385 transcription adapter) is sufficient to allow for the annealing of the poly(T)-adapter required for 386 reverse transcription and sequencing. This goes in line with the shortest median length we 387 observed for the 5S rRNA (see E. coli TEX sample) (seeSupplementary Fig. 4). For most of the 388 transcripts, a tail with 50 to 100 nt was detected. The overall correlation of transcript abundances 389 calculated from sequencing data using Nanopore or Illumina technology was very high given that 390 only mixed conditions could be compared in the case of H. volcanii and P. furiosus (see 391Supplementary Fig. 5a,b,c, transcript abundance data for TEX samples inSupplementary Table 2). 392 393 Mapping of transcriptional boundaries 394 Transcription start sites 395 Transcription start site (TSS) and transcription termination site (TTS) detection was based on the 396 determination of transcriptional units (TU) (compare material and methods section) 29 .

We observed 437 that homopolymer sequences are removed during trimming of the reads, which leads to TTS 438 positions that are positioned upstream of the poly(U) signal. Analysing individual transcripts in H. 439 volcanii and P. furiosus, we found that a single transcript can exhibit diverse 3' ends. This is true 440 for the Pilin transcript in H. volcanii and the Alba transcript in P. furiosus, respectively 441 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Both genes are highly expressed and some transcripts carry extended 3' 442 UTRs. While the majority of transcripts are terminating at the first poly(U) stretch, a subset of 443 transcripts is substantially longer and terminates at a second poly(U) termination signal 444 (Supplementary Figure 8). Interestingly, homogeneous short poly(U) signals are found both at the 445 canonical termination site and the termination site of the elongated 3'UTR in the case of the Pilin 446 transcript in H. volcanii. In contrast, the Alba gene transcripts in P. furiosus are terminated at both 447 sites via long consecutive poly(U) stretches. Surveying the heterogeneity of the transcripts with an 448 extended 3'UTR, we found a heterogeneous distribution in the length of the transcripts, which 449 possibly indicates a step-wise trimming of the 3'UTR to yield the mature RNAs. 450",

Among the 712 identified pre-rRNA intermediates, precursor (4) observed in P. furiosus, which include ligation at 713 the bhb motif of the upstream region of the 16S leader and downstream region of the 16S trailer 714 sequences continuous to the downstream tRNA/23S sequences is of particular interest. The 715 presence of this intermediate suggests that the 16S rRNA bulge-helix-bulge processing occurs 716 prior to internal tRNA and 23S rRNA maturation. This observation is also in agreement with our 717 recent cis-acting element analysis performed in H. volcanii 73,76,79 . In fact, based on this analysis we 718 have proposed a model by which 16S rRNA maturation proceeds and is required for the 719 downstream maturation of the internal tRNA and 23S rRNA. Moreover, we have hypothesized that 720 ligation of the 16S rRNA leader/trailer resulting from the 16S rRNA bulge-helix-bulge maturation 721 process generates a putative new pre-rRNA intermediate which we could observe for the first time 722 in Pyrococcus using native RNA sequencing. In addition, the presence of intermediates (1) and (relevance of the additionally identified intermediates for rRNA maturation is yet 727 unclear and will need to be appraised in the light of additional functional analysis. In conclusion, 728 despite some intrinsic limitations, direct RNA sequencing can be a useful tool to approach 729 intricated maturation pathway like rRNA maturation, and expand our understanding of RNA 730 maturation in prokaryotes. 731 732 Towards the mapping of rRNA modification patterns 733 RNA modifications have been described already in the 50-60s, and has gained significant attention 734 over the last years, under the generic term of epitranscriptome 100-102 . The high-throughput 735 analysis of these post-transcriptional modifications remains challenging and mostly relies on 736 indirect methods, like primer extension stops analysis or chemical recoding/derivation 737 strategies 103,104 . Native RNA sequencing may fill an important gap to systematically analyse RNA 738 modifications on a genome-wide scale. However, global strategies enabling the faithful 739 determination of RNA modification identity and position needs to be developed. Several recent 740 focused analyses have explored different strategies to evaluate the capacity of ONT to accurately 741 detect RNA modifications (e.g. m6A) 14,15,55,105,106 . In this study, we focused on the 16S rRNA which 742 is known to carry different types of RNA modifications which are introduced at different positions 743 and different stages of the small ribosomal subunit maturation 73,107 . Our study provides evidence 744 that RNA modification detection benefits of the use of unmodified/hypo-modified references (in 745 agreement with recent studies 15,106 ). In this study, we have used a sample-compare approach 746 analysing pre-rRNAs, which are expected to contain incomplete modification patterns, in 747 comparison to mature rRNAs, which are expected to harbor a completed modification pattern. To 748 validate our approach we have first focus on the almost universally conserved KsgA-dependent 749 dimethylations of the 16S rRNA 15,82,85 . Using our sample-compare strategy and KsgA deletion 750 strain we could unambiguously provide in vivo evidence that the archaeal KsgA-dependent 751 methylations of the 16S rRNA are completed at a late stage of the small ribosomal subunit 752 biogenesis. This result is in agreement with previous studies done in yeast and bacteria 84-86 . 753 the hyperthermophile P. furiosus, and a decrease amount of predicted rRNA 755 modifications in halophile H. volcanii in comparison to E. coli. These differential modification 756 patterns across archaea are in good agreement with previous studies and may reflect adaptation 757 to the environmental conditions that these extremophilic archaea encounter 49,87,88 . Unfortunately, 758 the exact nature of these modifications can not be unveiled yet. To facilitate their high-throughput 759 identification, future studies will require to develop and train algorithms improving the 760 identification confidence of diverse RNA modifications. 761 762 Benefits and limitations of Nanopore-based native RNA sequencing 763 Taken together, a key advantage of the native RNA-seq approach is that multiple features can be 764 addressed at once distinguishing the technique from the Illumina sequencing technology or 765 biochemical assays. ONT sequencing does not require large scale equipment and is a fast method. 766 Moreover, the method does not necessitate a reverse transcription step or PCR amplification 767 thereby avoiding biases introduced by these enzymes. Due to the limitations of the sequencing 768 read analysis platform, ONT sequencing does not accurately detect small RNAs yet. Additional 769 limitations of the native RNA-seq technique are currently (i) the high amount of input RNA 770 required (2-5 \u00b5g) to reach good coverage of the transcriptome without rRNA depletion, (ii) the 3' 771 bias during RNA sequencing (iii) limited throughput and (iv) limited possibilities for multiplexing. 772Although ONT sequencing has a comparably low sequencing accuracy, this did not pose a limitation 773 for our analysis. Due to the extraordinary read length and the sensitivity to base modifications, 774ONT-based native RNA-seq can provide valuable insights into (r)RNA processing, (r)RNA 775 modifications patterns and the transcription of large operons. Strikingly, ONT-based sequencing 776 is a bona fide single-molecule method and hence molecular heterogeneity in the transcriptome can 777 be analysed so that even minor RNA populations can be detected that are inevitably lost",
