The study indicated no increased risk of PRRS seropositivity for herds using artificial insemination with semen from PRRS seropositive AI-stations. Also the herd-size was non-related to the risk of PRRS seropositivity, indicating that air-borne spread of PRRS may not have been a predominant feature in Denmark. Introduction of replacement breeding animals from seropositive breeding-and multiplying herds significantly increased the risk of a herd being PRRS seropositive, as did introduction of 25 kg pigs for feeding. PRRS seropositivity was in the farmers' opinions associated with abortions in sows, early farrowing, high postweaning mortality and low weight gain in fattening pigs. However, the reported frequencies of problems were relatively low. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

We noted that the first 20-30 index clinical cases were about twice the size of other herds on the island, and also found a high frequency of closed herds with a good zoosanitary status among these. In the summers of 1994 and 1995 we conducted serological screenings based on slaughterhouse blood sampling of slaughterpigs. We found an increasing sero-prevalence in fattening pig producing herds from 16% in I994 to 27% in 1995. Danish artificial insemination (AI) stations have been detected serologically positive since late 1993, and at the summer of 1994 all 8 cooperatively owned AI-stations were PRRS seropositive. A screening of 340 breeding and multiplying herds (20 serum samples/month) has been carried out since May 1994, and in these herds we have detected an annual incidence of sero-conversion at 47~. The primary objective of the present epidemiological study was to evaluate potential herd-level risk factors for association to herd-level PRRS seropositivity. The secondary objective was to assess farmers' opinions concerning the implications of PRRS on herd health.",

Danish studies have been able, on an empirical basis, to support this view (e.g. Christensen et al., 1990 and Flori et al., 1995) . But in the present study the log herd-size was not (even marginally) significantly related to PRRS seropositivity, despite of great variability of herd-sizes in the sample. 3; years after the introduction of PRRS to Denmark (only) about 27% of the slaughterswine producing herds have become seropositive, which also does not indicate widespread airborne transmission.",

Also the time of onset of reported disease problems among case herds were concentrated around the winter of 1993-1994, whereas reported disease problems among control herds appeared more scattered (data not shown). However, the results were brought about by re-arranging the original case-control sample of PRRS seropositive and -negative herds into case-control samples of herds with and without given health problems, with subsequent statistical analysis.",
