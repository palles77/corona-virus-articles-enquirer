IM2 and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius DSM 639). The results indicated that the synonymous codon usage in A. pernix K1 was less biased, which was highly correlated with the GC 3S value. The codon usage patterns were phylogenetically conserved among these Crenarchaeota microorganisms. Comparatively, it is the species function rather than the gene function that determines their gene codon usage patterns. A. pernix K1, P. aerophilum str. IM2, and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 live in differently extreme conditions. It is presumed that the living environment played an important role in determining the codon usage pattern of these microorganisms. Besides, there was no strain-specific codon usage among these microorganisms. The extent of codon bias in A. pernix K1 and S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 were highly correlated with the gene expression level, but no such association was detected in P. aerophilum str. IM2 genomes.",

Several factors, such as compositional constraints [8, 9, 10] , translational selection [11] [12] [13] , and the mutational bias [14] , influence the pattern of gene codon usage bias. Furthermore, it is reported that the codon usage variations are also corrected with the protein secondary structure [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , cellular location of gene products [21] , and the gene function [22] [23] [24] .",

Two important codon usage indices, ENC and GC 3S , have been widely used to study the codon usage variation among different genes. The distributions of ENC and GC 3S values in A. pernix K1 are shown in Fig.1 It was reported that a plot of ENC against GC 3S can be effectively used to explore the heterogeneity of codon usage among genes [27] . If the codon usage pattern of the genes has certain influence other than the GC content, the comparison of the actual distribution of genes with the expected distribution under no selection could be indicative. In other words, if GC 3S is the only determinant factor shaping the codon usage pattern, the values of ENC would fall on a continuous curve, which represents random codon usage [29] . Fig.2 shows the distribution plot of ENC against GC 3S for A. pernix K1. The points in the plot were quite spread out and the bulk of genes did not appear to follow the theoretical curve, which suggests that there are other factors that contributed to the codon usage pattern in A. pernix K1 besides the genomic composition. To further investigate the correlation between synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide composi-tion, the linear regression analysis was implemented. The R 2 value and the significance level of these re-gression analyses are listed in Table 3 . There was a significant correlation between GC 3S content and the first two main PCA axes of RSCU in A.pernix K1 and other two Crenarchaeota microorganisms. Therefore, it is unquestionable that base compositional constraints are the major source determining the codon usage in the whole genome of these microorganisms. ",

All genes in the A. pernix K1 were plotted in red, all genes in P. aerophilum str. IM2 were plotted in green, and the genes in S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 were plotted in blue. Although this graph is a little complex with certain overlaps among the genes from different genomes, it is clear that A.pernix K1 genes are mainly located on the top right corner of the plot, while most of the P. aerophilum str.
