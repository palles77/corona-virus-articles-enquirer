Treatment with type-I IFNs is however associated with significant toxic side effects due to the ubiquitous expression of type-I IFN receptors. Type-III IFNs elicit similar cellular responses as type-I IFNs, but restricted expression of type-III receptors may limit potential side effects of treatment with type-III IFNs. A number of studies are now exploring the use of type-III IFNs, specifically IFN-k3, as anticancer agents. IFN-k4 is a newly discovered type-III IFN that is genetically regulated and produced in a subset of individuals. Previously, we showed that IFN-k4 inhibits proliferation in a hepatoma cell line, however its anticancer potential has not been explored in comparison to other type-III IFNs.",

Further, we found that hepatic macrophages, known as Kupffer cells, are a major source of liver IL-1b. Typically, IL-1b production is a tightly regulated pathway requiring a priming step to trigger IL-1b transcription and an activating signal to promote mature IL-1b processing and release. We found that the HCV virion is efficiently phagocytosed by the Kupffer cell and human THP1 macrophage cell line to drive signaling through TLR7/MyD88 and NLRP3 inflammasome. This process triggers IL-1b expression and mature IL-1b protein release, respectively. We have now identified the specific HCV-virion component, HCV core protein, as a driver of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. HCV core protein modulates many cellular events such as reactive oxygen species production and calcium signaling, all of which have been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. We found patient-derived core protein, isolated from patients with HCV infection, can stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and trigger the release of IL-1b.",

            "text": "Introduction: Chemokine receptors and their ligands are expressed on several tumour and cancer cells. Their expression has been correlated with migration and metastasis of cancer/tumour cells. CCR2 is expressed under varied immune conditions in T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, basophils, and dendritic cells. Furthermore, CCR2 is expressed in cancer tissues and upregulation correlates with advanced cancer/tumour, metastasis and relapse. CCR2 is regulated at the genomic level by several transcription factors which upon binding to the promoter of the gene, leads to either an upregulation or downregulation of the gene. One of the several proteins and pathways is the JAK-STAT3/5 pathway. The JAK-STAT3/5 pathways play a crucial role in cell differentiation, proliferation and thus has a critical role in cancers/tumours. The JAK-STAT3/5 pathway is regulated by cytokines including IL-2, IL-15 and IL-6 amongst several others. IL-2 has been well studied in cancer immunotherapy trials and current immunotherapy trials are also taking place with IL-15 in man. However, the precise mechanism of action and the cascade of proteins and events involved are not completely understood. This study, aims to investigate the regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway by IL-2 and IL-15 and its role in CCR2 mediated cancer metastasis in prostate cancer.",

[3] Introduction: Despite significant research efforts, breast cancer is still the most common malignancy in women and the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. A major challenge in breast cancer treatment is disease heterogeneity that is contributed by many factors including intrinsic cell factors, microenvironment, angiogenesis and tumor-specific immune responses. Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a transcription factor that controls inflammatory and immune responses. Analysis of over 3000 human breast cancer tissues revealed that high expression of IRF5 correlates with increased survival and lower incidence of metastasis, whereas the lower quartile of IRF5 expression is a significant marker of poor prognosis for recurrence-free survival. These data support a tumor suppressor role for IRF5. The main purpose of this study was to generate a murine model of spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis in order to determine whether loss of IRF5, as found in human breast tumor tissue, contributes to disease onset and/or progression.",

We further found that N-and O-glycosylation was dispensable for signaling of the IL-6R, as an IL-6R variant completely devoid of glycans was still transported to the cell surface and was biologically active.

Introduction: Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease whose progression from atypical ductal hyperplasia to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is regulated by the aberrant expression of multiple mediators produced by the mammary tumor itself and the adjacent reactive stroma. We previously found that expression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) was down-regulated in different stages of human DCIS and IDC, with loss of IRF5 expression correlating with metastasis. IRF5 is a critical mediator of the host immune response to pathogens and cellular response to DNA damage. It has recently been shown to play a role in macrophage polarization, with high levels expressed in M1 (proinflammatory) macrophages and low levels in M2 (anti-inflammatory). We also found that restoring IRF5 expression in the metastatic human mammary epithelial cell line MDA-MB-231 led to the recruitment of CXCR5(+) B and T cells to the tumor. These findings support a role for IRF5 in regulating tumor immunity. In order to directly address the in vivo function of IRF5 in the mammary tumor versus its function in the immune system, we generated syngeneic models of mammary tumorigenesis. Specifically, Irf5 +/+ and Irf5 -/-4T1 murine mammary tumor cells were generated and injected into mammary fat pads of Irf5 +/+ and Irf5 -/-BALB/c littermate mice. Kinetics of tumor formation, immune response and metastasis were monitored.",

Together, these data indicate that IRF5 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer through intrinsic control of tumor cell migration/invasion and extrinsic regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Thus, determining the pathways and mechanisms by which IRF5 influences tumor progression and tumor immunity will lead to the discovery of new biomarkers for prognosis and molecular targets for the treatment of breast cancer. nervous system neoplasms.

Introduction: PD-1/PD-L1 signaling is critical for the negative regulation of the immune response to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but little is known about the process by which these proteins are expressed aberrantly in the tumor microenvironment [1] . Moreover, conventional RNAi screening conducted in twodimensional (2D) monoculture methods are lacking in physiological relevance; a limitation that may be improved by recapitulating the tumor microenvironment in three-dimensional (3D) assay systems containing multiple cell types found in vivo [2] . Therefore, we hypothesized that RNAi screening for genes that are responsible for the negative regulation of the immune response would yield different results when the tumor microenvironment is recapitulated (3D) versus in monolayer culture (2D). These results could drastically impact the process of target identification and drug discovery by improving the reliability of hit selection.",

We have pioneered an oncolytic poliovirus therapy, PVSRIPO, which selectively targets and eliminates malignant cells. PVSRIPO is a recombinant polio:rhinovirus chimera, engineered to eliminate neuronal competence and is devoid of neuropathogenicity after intracerebral inoculation in non-human primates and in humans. PVSRIPO has cancer tropism due to widespread ectopic expression of the poliovirus receptor, CD155, in solid cancers. PVSRIPO is highly cytotoxic against malignant cells and is effective despite pre-existing neutralizing antibodies and viral cell killing proceeds in the presence of an active innate antiviral response. A first-in-human Phase-1 study with PVSRIPO at Duke University has shown remarkable promise in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), a uniformly lethal disease. PVSRIPO tumor cell killing is associated with the induction of danger-and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs) via antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) and simultaneous non-lethal infection of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) via CD155. Type I IFNs are known to inhibit tumor proliferation, activate innate immune cells and bridge innate and adaptive immunity among other functions.",

Introduction: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major global health problem affecting tens of millions of people [1] . It is a chronic irreversible lung disease characterized by abnormal enlargement of airspaces (emphysema), obstruction of the airways and chronic bronchitis, and persistent macrophage-rich inflammation. Progressive and permanent destruction of the lung parenchyma and airway thickening leads to unremitting breathlessness and disability. The presence of disease comorbidities, including infection susceptibility, metabolic syndrome, muscle wasting and osteoporosis, further reduce quality of life [2] . Alveolar macrophages are believed to play a key role by secreting factors that exacerbate inflammation and cause irreversible tissue damage. Treatment of COPD involves the use of bronchodilators and potent immunosuppressive drugs, which are only partially effective at managing symptoms and is not curative, thus there is a significant unmet clinical need to develop novel treatments [3] . Cytokine inhibition is an attractive target in COPD, as a multitude of cytokines have been linked to disease severity.",

This defect correlated with low levels of IFNa, a cytokine critical for immunity. Lower pDC numbers with impaired IFNa production was due to the decreased expression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (Flt3) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), respectively.

CCL5 and CCR5 are overexpressed in basal and HER-2+ breast cancer subtypes, with CCL5 expression associated with cancer progression and metastasis.

Moreover, the TORC1 complex in the mTOR pathway functions to integrate different signals beyond mRNA translation, including those associated with nutrient sensing.

Concomitant with enhanced proliferation we show CCL5 increases cell surface expression of the glucose transporter, GLUT1, and increases glucose uptake and ATP production by these cells. Blocking CCL5-inducible glucose uptake abrogates the enhanced proliferation induced by CCL5. We provide evidence that increased glucose uptake is associated with enhanced glycolysis. Moreover, CCL5 enhances the invasive capacity of these breast cancer cells. Using metabolomic profiling we show the metabolic signature of CCL5-treated primary mouse mammary tumor cells reflects increased levels of intermediates in multiple anabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, amino acid synthesis and lipid metabolism. This accumulation of metabolites suggests the potential for diversion of intermediates into alternate pathways for macromolecule synthesis, a metabolic signature consistent with requirements for cell proliferation and invasion. In mouse studies we show that there is a delay in tumor onset and smaller tumor volume for breast tumors that lack CCR5, associated with reduced glucose uptake, reduced GLUT1 expression and diminished metabolic activity. Using FTMS tissue imaging of mammary tumors we provide evidence that CCL5-CCR5 interactions enhance glycolysis, amino acid synthesis and lipid metabolism.",

IFN-beta-1a, IFN-beta-1b and IFN-lamda-1 inhibited BrdU incorporation of primary cultures of HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner, but IFN-lamda-1 showed a less inhibitory effect than IFN-beta-1a. However, both IFN-alpha-2a and 2b at the same doses to other IFNs did not inhibit growth of HUVECs. IFN-beta and IFN-lamda-1 also reduced cell survival of HUVECs evidenced by dramatic reduction of metabolic activity of viable cells, but this was not apparent with IFNalpha. Both types I and III IFNs had little effects on cell apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Furthermore, we evaluated the ability of IFNs to interfere with VEGF endothelial function as this growth factor is essential for endothelial cell survival, differentiation and angiogenesis. We found that IFN-beta treatment strongly inhibited VEGF-induced capillary development in an in-vitro model of angiogenesis in a manner comparable to bevacizumab antagonism of VEGF-induced angiogenesis. IFN-alpha also decreased VEGFinduced angiogenesis, but to a lesser extent. Interestingly, IFNlamda-1 had little impact on VEGF-induced angiogenesis.

Introduction: Since its discovery more than twenty years ago, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) has been tied to a diverse set of physiological and pathological functions. The pleotropic actions of STAT3 as a nuclear transcription factor activated by tyrosine phosphorylation have been thoroughly characterized. In addition to regulating nuclear transcription, a small pool of STAT3 resides in the mitochondria where it serves as a sensor and signaling hub for a number of metabolic stressors including reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial-localized STAT3 (mitoSTAT3) largely exerts its effects through direct or indirect regulation of the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC). In contrast to cytokine-induced import of STAT3 into the nucleus, it has been assumed that levels of STAT3 in the mitochondria are static.",

We examined the differential STAT1 and STAT3 binding profiles of na\u00efve and effector memory CD4 + T-cells to identify potential genetic markers of IL-6 driven disease. In na\u00efve CD4 T cells ChIP-seq analysis identified 224 peaks induced by IL-6 for STAT1 and 162 peaks for STAT3 where 29.4% and 43.2% respectively are in the promotor region. Bioinformatic analysis of these datasets using the MEME-ChIP web service mapped the enrichment of defined consensus motifs. Three DNA consensus motifs were associated with STAT1 involvement -corresponding to Interferon-regulatory factors response element, the GAS motif and a third not centrally enriched motif. Conversely, STAT3 ChIP-seq peaks mapped predominantly to the GAS motif, a C2H2 zinc finger factor binding site and a consensus sequence associated with the binding of ETS transcription factors. Thus, indicating potential associations and interactions with other transcriptional complexes. Relative enrichment for STAT1 and STAT3 control genes was reduced in the effector memory samples. Introduction: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)-associated factor-1 (XAF1) is a cytokine-regulated, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor (TRAF) domain-containing protein that has a poorly defined cellular function [1] . It was originally implicated as a tumor suppressor due to the putative inhibitory effects toward XIAP [2] . Here we report a possible role of XAF1 in the TNFa/TNF receptor (TNFR)-mediated signal transduction.",

Introduction: TNFR1, upon binding TNF-a, can induce activation of either NF-kB pathway or apoptosis by forming signalosome complex 1 and complex 2, respectively. Besides, TNF is known to activate ERK, p38, JNK and Akt pathways [1] . Although TNF mediated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling have been extensively studied, the signalosome responsible for activation of ERK, p38, JNK and Akt pathways has not characterized yet.

Introduction: HCC is the fifth most common and the third deadliest cancer worldwide. There is an urgent need to find sensitive markers for early diagnosis and to monitor postoperative recurrence in order to provide treatment for HCC. Cytokines play an important role in liver physiology, i.e., IL-6-type cytokines as mediators of the acute phase response. In addition, they contribute to cancer development and progression. Thus, HCC-associated cytokines as well as miRNAs are candidates for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of HCC. Results: In a first step, we analyzed and correlated the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in HCC and NASH patients, being at high risk to develop HCC. Herein, serum levels of IL-6 and of HGF were higher in HCC patients than in healthy controls and in advanced NASH patients, as confirmed by Bio-Plex cytokine immunoassays. Next, we wanted to study a possible correlation between cytokine levels and the presence of the PNPLA3 p.148M risk variant in patients with NASH, thereby contributing to biomarker research in liver diseases.",

Surprisingly, IL-6 caused thousands of mRNAs to be differentially regulated in HepG2 and HuH-7 hepatoma cell lines, whereas levels of only few miRNAs were significantly changed (FDR < 0.05, logFC 0.5). In contrast to HCC cell lines, a stronger response of the miRNome following IL-6 stimulation was observed in primary hepatocytes (68 and 27 differentially expressed miRNAs in two samples, respectively). To further address this possible cell type and tissue specificity, we tested the effect of STAT-1 or STAT-3-activating cytokines (IL-27, IFN-k, OSM and H-IL-6) on both the miRNome and the mRNA transcriptome of healthy and cancerous cell lines, derived from human liver, colon and skin cells. Moreover, the regulation and roles of selected IL-6/Jak/STAT3-related miRNAs with possible relevance for HCC are currently further analyzed. Introduction: Interleukin-17A (IL-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine essential in host defense against extracellular pathogens but also promotes inflammation in many autoimmune disease settings. IL-17 induces inflammatory signaling through de novo transcription and post-transcriptional regulation of downstream genes. One major mechanism of IL-17-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation occurs through alterations in mRNA stability of target gene transcripts. Here, we report a new mechanism by which IL-17 increases the mRNA half-life of downstream target genes through the RNA binding protein known Arid5a (AT-rich interactive domaincontaining protein 5A). Arid5a was previously shown to stabilize Il6 (Interleukin-6) and Stat3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) transcripts by direct binding to the 3'UTR, thus counteracting the destabilizing effect of the endoribonuclease MCPIP1 (also known as Regnase-1).",

Introduction: Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) is an inflammatory cytokine regulating proliferation and/or apoptosis in a wide variety of cells. TNFa elicits its biological effects by binding to its cognate Type I (TNFR1) and Type II (TNFR2) receptors. Although pathways activated by TNFR1 have been extensively studied, factors or pathways regulating TNFR1 signaling remain elusive. cAMP has been previously implicated in regulation of TNFR1 signaling [1] , however the mechanism of this regulation is not documented. TNFR1 death domain bears two threonine residues (T411 and T417), which lie within putative PKA consensus motif (RxxT/S). Thus, we hypothesized that TNFR1 might be targeted by PKA, as a possible regulation mechanism.",

IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3 also differentially alter the cooperative actions between IL-22 and IL-17, which are commonly co-expressed in autoimmune settings. In addition, we demonstrate that IL-22BPi1 is inactive because it is not secreted.

In the central nervous system (CNS), chronic production of IFN-a is the cause of a number of neurological diseases, collectively termed ''cerebral type I interferonopathies\". They include chronic viral infections of the CNS, systemic lupus erythematosus-associated neurologic manifestations and genetic disorders exemplified by Acardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. However, the effector cells in the CNS and the molecular mechanisms underlying IFN-a mediated CNS disease are unknown.",

Introduction: Macrophages are important players in host defence responses against pathogens and produce protective proinflammatory cytokines along with interleukin (IL)-10 in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligation. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and IL-1b are essential for resistance against infection but, if produced at high levels, may contribute to immunopathology. In contrast, IL-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine, which dampens these responses, but can also lead to defective pathogen clearance.

Next, we demonstrated that ULK1 expression is required for activation of downstream IFNk signaling pathways. Moreover, IFNk-induced transcriptional activation via GAS elements as well as the transcription of several ISGs was significantly reduced in the absence of ULK1/2 expression. In subsequent studies, we observed that ULK1/2 DKO cells are less responsive to the antiviral effects of IFNk compared to WT cells.

The pathogenesis of SS involves many components, including deregulated salivary glandular epithelial cells (SGECs) that present antigen presenting cell (APC)-like phenotype and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines.

RNA-sequencing of liver gene expression revealed that differentially expressed genes in female ARE-Del-/-mice are consistent with stronger Type I and II interferon signaling and T helper cell-mediated immune responses in female mice that serves as the basis of the sex bias observed in this disease. Female ARE-Del-/-mice have significantly increased CD4 T cells but decreased CD8 T cells compared to control littermates, resulting in an elevated CD4/CD8 T cell ratio. Consequently, transfer of CD4+ T cells from ARE-Del-/mice to B6/Rag1 -/mice induced moderate portal and parenchymal inflammation, whereas CD8+ T cell transfer did not induce any pathological phenotypes. Moreover, profiles of autoantigen reactivities using peptide arrays indicated that female ARE-Del-/-mice had a high induction of IgM reactive autoantigens associated with autoimmune diseases as compared to male mice, while the levels of IgG reactive autoantigens were not significantly different in females vs. males. To further assess the role of Type 1 interferon in the disease process ARE-DEL/IFNa/b receptor double knockout mice were generated.

In response, the government built communities of fully subsidized temporary houses of less than 30 m 2 per family. While most reports focus on radiation effects in Fukushima residents, this report looks at the physical and psychological health of residents in temporary housing many of whom are afflicted with adverse health issues not derived from radiation-effects. As an initiative to provide health support to evacuees, doctors at Minami-soma Municipal General Hospital holds health forums in each of nine temporary housing communities once every two months. As a part of this program, evacuees underwent medical and other tests so doctors could get a clearer understanding of the health status and risks of temporary housing residents at July, 2015.",

Methods: Our studies make use of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model of persistent viral infection, wherein the viral variant Clone 13 elicits a persistent infection by quickly outcompeting the immune response and inducing immunosuppression. Naive transgenic LCMV-specific CD4 T cells were transferred into mice at the onset or in the midst of persistent viral infection demonstrating a severe inhibition of de novo Th1 cell priming in the midst of persistent viral infection. In vivo antibody blockades of various immunosuppressive factors prior to CD4 T cell priming, as well as various sorting and in vitro culture strategies tease out the mechanisms, molecules and cell types driving inhibition of CD4 Th1 priming. Further, by in vitro polarizing LCMV-specific Th1 cells and introducing them into mice with established persistent viral infection we can reconstitute the lost Th1 responses and assess the outcome of this on virus-specific CD8 T cell responses and ultimately viral control.",

Introduction: Type I and II interferons (IFNs) divergently impact host resistance to bacteria. Type II IFN (g) activates macrophages to promote effective anti-bacterial immunity, while type I IFNs (ab) suppress macrophage responsiveness to IFNk and increase susceptibility to several bacterial infections. The suppressive effects of type I IFNs correlate with suppression of macrophage cell surface IFNk receptor (IFNGR). Here, we show this suppression is independent of canonical signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein-dependent signaling and instead requires activity of the CK2 kinase.",

While M2-like M-CSF cultured BMDMs exhibit lower cytokine production that can be markedly increased by coincident cell stress, GM-CSF treated M1like cell populations exhibit strong cytokine production with very limited stress sensitivity. Resident tissue macrophages in the liver exhibit M2-like low cytokine expression while monocytes infiltrating the liver following acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury show an M1 phenotype that transitions from M1 to M2 phenotype over 48-72 h. Exposure to cell stress (by ip injection of Tunicamycin) dramatically elevates LPS-induced cytokine production in resident liver macrophages and restores M1 phenotype to infiltrating cells that have transitioned to M2 status at late times following injury. Introduction: West Nile virus (WNV) infection in humans leads to a range of disease outcomes, varying from no clinical signs of disease through severe meningitis, encephalitis, and death. The inbred mouse models used for most WNV disease studies fail to capture the breadth of human disease outcomes, limiting the conclusions which can be made in terms of the genetic and transcriptomic underpinnings of viral susceptibility and disease progression. The Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse model has been developed as a recombinant inbred population which encompasses >90% of the diversity within the mouse genome. The CC mouse model effectively presents the full spectrum of disease associated with human WNV infection. Here, we apply the CC model toward understanding the transcriptional response to WNV over a range of disease outcomes to reveal the immune and inflammatory responses to WNV infection.",

Children younger than 2 years old and individuals older than 65 years are the most vulnerable for invasive disease. Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is a secreted cytokine produced mainly by cells of the lymphoid lineage and innate lymphoid cells. Ligation of IL-22 to IL-22RA1 and IL-10R2 results in activation of JAK1/TYK2 kinases and downstream phosphorylation of STAT proteins, in particular STAT3. IL-22RA1 is characteristically expressed in epithelial cells, and its activation by IL-22 is involved in the pathogenesis of extracellular organisms including Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection. IL-22 signaling is related to maintaining barrier integrity, mediating recruitment of leukocytes, and induction of antimicrobial peptides.

Administration of recombinant IL-22 systemically to infected wild type mice decreased bacterial burden in lung and liver at 24 h post infection.

Importantly, we found that hetIL-15 treatment led to preferential enrichment of Pmel-1 cells in the tumor sites in an antigen-dependent manner. hetIL-15 treatment also increased proliferation and cytotoxic ability of tumorinfiltrating Pmel-1 cells, while reducing their PD-1 level and resulting in improved tumor control and survival benefit. Introduction: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by a progressive immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic b-cells and associated metabolic dysfunction caused mostly by the loss of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Recent studies have shown deficiencies in both the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor and its signaling pathway. In fact, decreased responsiveness to IL-2 measured by STAT5 phosphorylation (pSTAT5) is observed in T1D patients. Originally, IL-2 was developed as an immune stimulator, able to enhance effector T cell (Teff) and natural killer (NK) cell function. It is now well known that another function of IL-2 is the generation and survival of Tregs. Several studies in both mouse and human have demonstrated that IL-2 therapy can suppress autoimmunity. The major goal for immunotherapies would be to develop IL-2 that would selectively activate and boost the tolerogenic immune response.",

Introduction: Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a cytokine that plays a key role in several inflammatory diseases, including asthma and atopic dermatitis. It is released by damaged cells and stimulates proinflammatory signaling pathways in various cell types such as T cells, innate lymphoid cells, mast cells and macrophages. IL-33 signals through a receptor complex at the cell membrane consisting of the IL-33 receptor (ST2) and the co-receptor IL-1RAcP. Blocking the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis with the soluble (extracellular) form of the IL-33 receptor (sST2) has been shown to be beneficial in experimental models of asthma. However, the effect is rather weak due to the low ligand binding affinity of sST2, implicating a need for better and stronger antagonists. We show here that a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of mouse ST2 and IL-1RAcP, further referred to as IL-33trap, is much more potent than sST2 in inhibiting mouse IL-33 activity in vitro and in vivo.",

While these agents are effective, they are associated with significant dose-limiting toxicities that prevent their use at levels sufficient to promote optimal therapeutic benefit. The toxicity of therapeutic cytokines is likely mediated via cognate receptor activation on cells other than those that mediate their therapeutic effects. For example, IFNa, which is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), has a narrow therapeutic index.

The detail and the proof-of-concept demonstration of our technology can be seen in our recent publication (Nata et al. 2015). BNZ132-1 is a novel inhibitor of IL-2 and IL-15 that blocks the actions of each cytokine efficiently in vivo. We next switched our focus on blocking the interplay between IL-15 and IL-21, another gcfamily cytokine, because these two are now being implicated in the pathogenesis of Celiac disease.

This can have positive effects, such as in the maintenance of epithelial barriers in the gastrointestinal tract, but also negative effects, such as contributing to colorectal tumorigenesis. As IL-22 can be dualnatured, we hypothesized that its biological activity should be tightly regulated in order to limit IL-22 expression to the sites of inflammation.

SLE patients are characterized by increased levels of auto-reactive B cells and autoantibodies, and Irf5 -/mice were previously shown to have drastically reduced numbers of antibody secreting cells. Conclusions made from these mice, however, were compromised by the discovery of a secondary mutation in DOCK2. Important, multiple murine models of lupus show Irf5 -/mice are protected from pathogenic autoantibodies. To determine if IRF5 has similar function(s) in human primary B cells, we sought to characterize the role of IRF5 in plasmablast differentiation, antibody secretion, and B cell activation.",

Introduction: Genetic variants of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). IRF5 regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs) believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. The IRF5 risk genotype has been shown to associate with elevated IRF5 expression, high serum IFN-a activity and autoantibody production in SLE patients. However, elevated IRF5 expression may have been a result of disease-associated factors, such as elevated type I IFNs, rather than genotype. Furthermore, previous data from our lab has shown that IRF5 is constitutively activated in SLE immune cells. To avoid interference from the disease, we took advantage of the Genotype And Phenotype (GAP) Registry at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research and examined IRF5 expression and function in healthy donors carrying the homozygous risk or non-risk IRF5 genotype, and intermediate haplotypes. The aim of this study was to identify the functional contribution of the IRF5 risk genotype to SLE onset.",

Introduction: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a potent immunoregulatory enzyme which catalytic and non-catalytic effects are involved in the regulation of immunity and autoimmune diseases. Cytokines are important modulator of the expression of IDO1: interferon-c upregulates IDO1 in dendritic cells while interleukin 6 (IL-6) promotes proteasomal degradation of the enzyme. Current data show that approximately 25% of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) exhibit a post-translational (and not genetic) defect of IDO1 in a subset of PBMC which is characterized by a IDO1 high IDO1 low IL-6 high phenotype. Interestingly, this phenotype can be completely corrected by co-incubation of PBMCs with tocilizumab, a licensed IL-6 receptor blocker. Therefore, data indicate the existence of a subset of individuals with T1D who may gain clinical benefit in restoring IDO1 immunoregulatory mechanisms by treatment with tocilizumab.",

Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is often thought of as a disease driven by molecular pathways related to autoreactive B cells and anti-nuclear antibodies. However, therapeutics targeting of B cells, including BAFF blockade, have been only partially effective in SLE. NF-jB Inducing Kinase (NIK) mediates BAFF signaling and also noncanonical NF-jB signaling downstream of non-BAFF/BR3 TNFR family members.

As predicted, NIK inhibition recapitulated the pharmacological effects of BAFF blockade.

Introduction: IL-17A drives the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease but promotes immunity to fungal infections. To date, the IL-17 signaling pathway is still not well understood. IL-17A binding to the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) initiates recruitment of adaptor proteins such Act1 and TRAF6, leading to activation of the NF-jB and MAPK pathways. These pathways are negatively regulated by the A20/ TNFAIP3 ubiquitin editing protein. The TNIP1 gene is associated with autoimmune diseases in GWAS studies. Its gene product, ABIN1, is an A20-associated factor. Accordingly, we hypothesized that ABIN1 might function as an inhibitor in the IL-17 signaling pathway.",

IL-38 was N-terminally processed in apoptotic cells to generate a mature cytokine with distinct properties. Both full-length and truncated IL-38 bound to X-linked interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1). However, we show higher affinity binding of mature IL-38.

The most surprising finding of this study is a selective defect in Fas-mediated apoptosis in HAM. First, ex vivo and in vitro Fas surface expression correlated negatively to in vitro apoptosis (p = 0.012, r = -0.63). Second, by fluorescence microscopy we document that Fas lo but not Fas hi cells preferentially undergo apoptosis in vitro. Conversely, in vitro treatment of PBMCs with agonist anti-Fas mAb, but not antagonist anti-Fas mAb, was able to trigger apoptosis and restore the selective defect in HAM patients, indicating that the receptor is functional but skewed towards other biological pathways, e.g. proliferation. Indeed, Fas expression was positively correlated (p = 0.018, r = 0.62) to lymphoproliferation upon in vitro culture, but not to proviral load or viral protein levels.

It does not only control the amount of the receptors on the cell surface, but also creates soluble receptors with distinct biological functions. Interleukin (IL)-11 is a member of the IL-6 family which has been initially described to have anti-inflammatory properties. However, recent studies revealed that overshooting IL-11 activity is involved in inflammation and the progression of epithelial cancers. IL-11 binds to the membrane-bound IL-11 receptor (IL-11R), and this complex can then recruit two molecules of the b-receptor glycoprotein (gp)130, which predominantly leads to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway.

Key factors contributing to early stages of CVDs include the pro-inflammatory cytokines: Interferon (IFN)a, IFNk, Interleukin (IL)-6 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) stimuli. Together, they trigger activation of members of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) and Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) families. In particular STAT1, 2, 3, IRF1 and IRF8 have recently been recognized as prominent modulators of inflammation, especially in immune and vascular cells during atherosclerosis. Using RNAseq, we identified a specific set of STAT-and IRF-dependent pro-atherogenic genes that were synergistically affected by interactions between IFNk and LPS in primary aortic VSMCs, namely: multiple chemokines, adhesion molecules, antiviral and antibacterial response genes. Based on this, STATs and IRFs represent interesting therapeutic targets and their targeted inhibition could be a promising novel treatment strategy in CVDs.",

Introduction: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by many cell types and can promote inflammation, immune response, differentiation, and proliferation. A principal signaling pathway of the IL-6/gp130 receptor activates Janus kinases and the STAT3 transcription factor. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of IL-6 on cellular survival and tumor development in MYCdriven tumorigenesis. We used the E\u00ec-myc transgenic mouse, a model of Burkitt's B cell lymphoma, in which elevated levels of c-MYC are expressed in the B cell lineage.",

Introduction: Basophilia is a frequently observed hematological abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but its pathophysiological roles are undefined. We previously demonstrated that an inflammatory chemokine, CCL3, preferentially acts on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and crucially contributes to the maintenance of leukemia initiating cells (LICs) in bone marrow (BM) during the initiation process of CML. However, the major cellular source of CCL3 in BM and the precise mechanism of CCL3-mediated maintenance of LICs remain to be investigated. To delineate the cellular process facilitating this CCL3-mediated crosstalk between normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, we precisely examined CCL3-expressing cells and their functions in both normal hematopoiesis and CML leukemogenesis.",

Introduction: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling is a key component of inflammatory responses. The complex recruits two molecules of the signal transducing subunit glycoprotein130 (gp130), which is ubiquitously expressed whereas IL-6R expression is restricted to hepatocytes and some leukocyte populations. Besides the membrane-bound form a soluble form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is found, which binds IL-6 with the same affinity. This trans-signaling mechanism greatly expands the target cell spectrum of IL-6. It has been shown that this mechanism mediates most of the proinflammatory actions of IL-6 and is also involved in the recruitment of mononuclear cells during acute inflammation. We aimed to find the protease contributing to circulating sIL-6R in the blood and analyzed whether the sIL-6R is generated at the site of inflammation by proteolytic cleavage from infiltrating leukocytes.",

However, some patients who have received TKIs have started to exhibit resistant CML [5] . One of the resistance mechanisms is a BCR-ABL mutation in the kinase domain, which is effectively managed by newly developed TKIs.

Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) has been cloned as a negative regulator of various cytokine signaling including JAK/STAT pathway.

Antibody-mediated blockade of IL-18 reduced human GC cell growth in vitro. Elevated IL-18 protein and ASC mRNA levels were observed in human GC tumour biopsies.",

The proliferation of cocultured and single cultured MDA-MB-231 cells was tested using Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK-8) method. FSP-1 expression in the breast cancer tissue of tumor-burdened nude mice was analyzed using immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscope, and the effect of FSP-1 on tumor growth of tumor-burdened nude mice was examined.

Introduction: Similar to Type I IFNs (IFN-a/b), Type III IFNs (IFN-k1,2,3,4) exert antiviral and antiproliferative effects through a JAK-STAT mediated pathway that activates ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9) and consequently induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN-ks signal through a receptor complex distinct from that of IFNa/b, composed of IL-10R2 and IFN-kR, which appears to be preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. This suggests that IFN-k's primary role is to provide antiviral protection to mucosal compartments. IFN-kR-deficient mice have been developed, but due to the overlapping activities of type III and type I IFNs, a unique role for IFN-k in antiviral immunity has yet to be elucidated. Most viral infections induce the expression of both type I and type III IFNs, but it is unclear which cells are responsible for IFN-k production in vivo, and whether IFN-k production is induced by the same mechanisms which trigger type I IFN synthesis.",

Introduction: Interferons (IFNs) are classified into three different types, type I, type II and type III (or k) IFNs, based on their structure, receptor complexes and biological activities. In humans, type III IFNs (IFN-ks) are represented by IFN-k1, IFN-k2, IFN-k3 and a recently identified IFN-k4, which shares only a limited homology with other IFN-ks. There is a frequently occurring frame shift mutation in the Ifnl4 gene that can be used as a prediction marker for the responsiveness of patients chronically infected with HCV to IFN-abased therapies. Paradoxically, the presence of the intact Ifnl4 gene is associated with poor response to anti-HCV treatments, suggesting a unique function for IFN-k4. Studies of IFN-k4 have been tempered by difficulties in generating biologically active IFN-k4 protein, particularly from mammalian cells, due to its poor secretion from human cells.",

Introduction: Interferon lambdas (IFNLs) are potent antiviral cytokines that are widely implicated in many chronic inflammatory diseases [1] .

Numerous tissues have reported IFNL expression, but there remains controversy over which blood cell subsets are responsive to IFNL and thus contribute to inflammatory activity in chronic diseases.",

In the absence of type I IFN signaling, Ly6C lo monocytes/macrophages become phenotypically and functionally more pro-inflammatory than Ly6C hi cells, revealing an unanticipated function of the Ly6C lo mononuclear cell subset in tissue inflammation.

TRIF enhanced STING dimerization and membrane mobilization: dimeric STING was undetectable in TRIF -/cells after ligand treatment and distinct clustering of STING was observed upon ligand stimulation of Wt cells, but not TRIF -/cells. HSV1 infection triggers STING signaling to induce IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) which inhibit virus replication.

Others have observed association of specific TRIF mutations with Herpes Simplex Encephalitis in patients; we could attribute this association to defective STING signaling causing enhanced virus replication. For example, the mutant, TRIF P625L, is associated with Herpes Simplex Encephalitis; although it can mediate TLR3 signaling, we showed that it was defective in STING signaling because of its inability to bind STING.

Our studies indicate that IRF5 plays a critical role in effective immune response to West Nile virus (WNV).

Expression of other inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to WNV infection is also dependent on IRF5. These observations suggest that the effector function of IRF5 target genes is an essential component of anti-WNV immunity.

Introduction: The human myxovirus resistance proteins MxA and MxB are expressed upon stimulation with type I and type III interferons (IFNs) induced by viral infection. While MxA is wellknown to elicit potent antiviral effects against a multitude of RNA and DNA viruses, MxB has long been unrecognized to serve any antiviral function. In 2013, three independent research groups provided first clear evidence for a potent antiviral effect of MxB against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other primate lentiviruses. Subsequent evolutionary analyses however concluded that the amino acid motifs associated with lentiviral restriction were not subject to positive selection in primates. In addition, the residues that are associated with MxB GTPase function are highly conserved among mammals, but the capacity to bind and/ or hydrolyze GTP is not required to inhibit HIV-1 replication. Altogether, this indicates that MxB has additional antiviral (but non-lentiviral functions) that are yet to be uncovered.",

Despite the importance of these ISGs in cellular immunity, the functions of most ISGs are unknown. In recent screening efforts, we found multiple ISGs to be inhibitory to the infection of a panel of viruses. Interestingly, a small number of ISGs were found to enhance infection of multiple viruses. One of the more robustly enhancing ISGs was mucolipin-2 (MCOLN2), which promoted infection by a diverse set of viruses.

In the present study we find that selective IFNab receptor deficiency is sufficient for systemic CW3 persistence in spite of functional B and T cell responses. CW3 has a cellular tropism for macrophages and dendritic cells; we find that deletion of the IFNab receptor on CD11c-or LysM-expressing myeloid cells but not on Villin-expressing intestinal epithelial cells results in increased early viral titers and systemic persistence without persistent fecal shedding. Persistence in this setting is correlated with increased cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses that control but do not clear CW3 infection. Furthermore, increased early replication and persistence are also observed in mixed bone marrow chimeras where 50% of the CD11c-positive DCs are unable to respond to IFNab demonstrating that a cell-intrinsic IFNab response is required for control and clearance of systemic norovirus infection.",

Our results identified differential regulation of a subset of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) following infection.

Introduction: In obesity and metabolic syndrome, manifestation of a latent adipose tissue inflammation and, consequently, systemic inflammation is closely related to disturbance of insulin signaling resulting in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Insulin-dependent glucose uptake via Glut-4 activation is mediated by PI3K/Akt pathway, with phosphorylation of Akt kinase on Thr-308 which is governed by insulin directly and phosphorylation of Ser-473 which mostly depends on mTORC2 activity and also on insulin action. The distortion of this signal in inflammatory conditions could be reduced or abolished by the agents skewing inflammatory M1 macrophages (Mph) to acquire alternative, antiinflammatory M2 phenotype. In our work we studied the influence of activation of SIRT1 in M1 Mph on insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation in adipocytes.",

Introduction: Inflammation is a biological response that protects organisms from harmful stimuli. During the occurrence of inflammation, activated immune cells secrete many inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokine, which promote inflammatory responses.

Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition, defined by an array of affective and attentional disturbances, that can result from the experience or witnessing of traumatic or life-threatening events, such as combat exposure. Emerging evidence suggests PTSD and its psychobiological manifestations are linked to a systemic low-grade inflammatory state characterized by increased circulating pro-inflammatory mediators, as well as decreased anti-inflammatory mediators. Few studies, however, have investigated potential alterations in inflammatory biomarker indices in military PTSD and have yielded mixed results. The aim of this study was to compare levels of key pro-and antiinflammatory markers in combat veterans with PTSD vs. healthy trauma-exposed and non-deployed soldiers.",

EGF expression in breast cancer tissue of tumor-burdened nude mice was marked by fluorescent antibody and observed using laser confocal microscopy.

Introduction: Both type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are now well recognized for their non-redundant importance in limiting viral infection; however their roles as inflammatory mediators are less well characterized. Both IFN types signal through the common Jak/ STAT pathway, each type through their distinct receptor complex. While there is functional redundancy between type I and type III IFNs, the restriction of the type III IFN receptor expression primarily to epithelial cells suggests an important role for the type III IFNs at mucosal surfaces. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, involves perturbation of the complex interactions between the mucosal immune system and the commensal bacteria of the gut, with cytokines acting as important cross-regulators of these multi-layered interactions.",

We now demonstrate that the negative feedback is mediated in part via IL-19, a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines. IL-19 is strongly induced by IL-17-stimulated keratinocytes and appears to function at least in part via an autocrine/paracrine mechanism to suppress recruitment of IL-17-producing cdT cells, thereby dampening IL-17 production. This stands in contrast to IL-17 cytokines/CIKS-mediated signaling into non-keratinocytes, particularly dermal fibroblasts during the early phase of the inflammation, which promoted cellular infiltration and enhanced accumulation of IL-17-producing cdT cells in skin, comprising an initial positive feedforward mechanism.",

Introduction: BATF3 has been shown to be a critical transcription factor for the development of a distinct subset of dendritic cells (DCs) characterized by the expression of CD24 and CD103 in the periphery and CD8a in lymphoid tissues. Using mice deficient for BATF3, these DCs have been shown in multiple models to be the required antigen presenting cells (APCs) for priming of CD8+ T cells, and are a critical source of the IL-12 needed to generate a protective T cell response during infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Protection from infection by T. gondii is dependent on a T cell response that can be generated by immunization the non-replicating CPS strain of T. gondii. Despite this low dose of parasite antigen, CPS immunization results in a T cell response with the same magnitude as that during active infection. It is not well understood what cells and cytokine signals are required for CPS to generate this T cell response. Surprisingly, it is shown here that BATF3-/-mice generate neither a CD8+ nor CD4+ T cell response to CPS immunization despite a previously undescribed role for BATF3 dependent DCs (BATF3 DCs) in priming CD4+ T cells. The aim of these studies is to determine what role BATF3 DCs play in priming CD4+ T cells during CPS immunization.",

To track the interactions of CPS with host immune cells in these tissues, Ai6 reporter mice were immunized with CPS-Cre-mCherry parasites and analyzed on 1 and 2 dpi. It is shown that resident peritoneal macrophages are the cells that primarily interact with the parasite, while BATF3 DCs do not directly interact with CPS.

Introduction: The immune system generates innate and adaptive responses to ensure clearance of pathogens. Both are essential for host protection, but to develop sustained immunity, antigen-specific memory responses are needed. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key players as they bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. They activate and polarise T cells into effector cells which are crucial for adaptive immunity. The induction of immune responses is crucial to fight infections, but it can be also detrimental to the host and tight regulation is needed. Ubiquitination is an important mechanism of regulating immune responses. There are multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases, which have been studied in context of immunity, but the role of Pellino proteins is just emerging. Significant progress has been made on delineating the role of Pellino1 and Pellino3 but the physiological roles of Pellino2 are poorly understood. The current study aimed to use Pellino2-deficient mice to explore Pellino2 function in immune responses.",

Moreover, levels of IL-39 in circulation rise in response to inflammation induced by thioglycollate injection into the peritoneal cavity. In order to elucidate the function of IL-39, we have produced an IL-39 -/mouse. Although IL-39 deficient mice have comparable numbers of major immune cell populations in their immune organs, the effector functions of some of these cells are altered. For example, activated splenocytes from IL-39 -/mice produce abnormal levels of cytokines when compared to splenocytes isolated from their WT littermates.To elucidate the role of IL-39 in innate and/or adaptive immune responses, we tested the IL-39 -/mice in a model of acute T. gondii infection. We found that levels of IL-39 in serum and peritoneal cavity significantly increase in response to infection. Surprisingly, IL-39 deficient mice were more resistant to the T. gondii infection as indicated by reduced pathogen load and increased survival. Analysis of various cytokines and chemokines in serum from infected WT and IL-39 deficient mice revealed that IL-39 -/mice had lower levels of several proinflammatory mediators including CXCL1 and CCL2. High levels of these chemokines have strong correlation with increased mortality suggesting that with sublethal doses of T. gondii infection, mice die from sepsis rather than from the infection itself.",

However, despite this regulation of innate immune defense in the hepatocyte, the HCV-infected liver is most typically in a state of persistent innate immune activation. This outcome suggests a role for immune crosstalk in which signaling-competent liver cells direct the hepatic response to infection. Importantly, we have found that HCV produced during chronic infection is phagocytosed by liver macrophages, called Kupffer cells, wherein the internalized virion triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome. HCV does not productively infect Kupffer cells but induces potent IL-1b production and release to drive hepatic inflammation that underlies liver disease.

However, an understanding of the mechanisms via which IL-6 mediates central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and injury is unclear. A transgenic mouse (termed GFAP-IL6 mice) model with CNS-restricted production of IL-6 replicates many of the key neuropathological and behavioural changes found in human neuroinflammatory disease [1] . Microglia, the tissue-resident macrophages of the CNS, may be a major target of IL-6 and effector cells in IL-6-mediated neuroinflammation. Therefore the objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the nature of the microglial response to IL-6 in the CNS.",

Introduction: Pathogenesis of allergic diseases including asthma is strongly associated with robust responses of Th2 cells, which produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that is expressed upon epithelial infection or dysfunction and is implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders. Although the functions of TSLP in stimulating dendritic cells and promoting Th2 differentiation are well appreciated, direct mechanisms of action of TSLP on the Th2 effector state remain to be elucidated. Previously, TSLP was shown to increase responsiveness of human CD4 T cells to IL-2 and enhance survival of murine CD4 cells by inducing JAK1/JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway [1, 2] . Now we sought to determine the role of TSLP in Th2 cell differentiation and gain insight into its molecular mechanism of action during TCR activation.",

Introduction: Th17 cells drive autoimmune inflammation through production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-17, GM-CSF and IFNk. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has physiological roles in central nervous system (CNS) development including myelination, but is best known for its role in promoting amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 is also thought to contribute to neurodegenerative processes triggered by CNS injury, and is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli. On the other hand, BACE1 deficiency causes impaired myelination of the CNS and has been reported to reduce repair following peripheral nerve injury. We therefore sought to investigate the role of BACE1 in Th17-induced neuroinflammation in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).",

They cause chronic infections that are associated with type-2 and regulatory immune responses. Helminths not only suppress the anti-parasite immune response but can also combat pathological inflammation, including autoimmunity. Indeed, regions with a high prevalence of helminth infections have a low incidence of autoimmune disease. Consequently, helminths are being trialled as potential therapies for autoimmune diseases. However, the use of live helminths as a treatment raises many regulatory and practical concerns. This has led for the search to identify specific helminth immunoregulatory molecules. Our lab has demonstrated that Fasciola hepatica excretory-secretory products (FHES) can attenuate the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, by suppressing the infiltration of diseasemediating Th1 and Th17 cells into the CNS. Protection was mediated by the type-2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-33.",

Positive fractions were screened by mass spectrometry. Several candidate proteins were identified, cloned, transformed into yeast, expressed, and purified. Macrophages were treated in vitro with these proteins to assay their ability to promote alternative activation. To assay the effects of candidate proteins on autoimmunity, we injected mice with EAE with the candidate proteins, beginning on day -1 and continuing throughout the disease course. Parallel to this, we isolated small extracellular vesicles (exosomes) from FHES by various centrifugation steps and tested their efficacy to promote type-2 responses in vivo.",

Virology, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany Introduction: Type I interferon (IFN-I) responses that are induced early after virus infection confer protection until adaptive immunity is initiated. Upon vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection Toll-like receptor (TLR) and RIG-I-like helicase (RLH) signaling platforms are indispensable for the induction of protective IFN-I. Hence, TLR-and RLH-ablated TLR/RLH -/mice challenged with VSV do not mount IFN-I responses and are inevitably susceptible to lethal infection.",

The mouse and human Il22 and IL22 promoters have a conserved putative hypoxia response element (HRE). Hypoxiainduced upregulation of IL-22 was dependent on the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a). Conclusion: In CD4 T cells, IL-22 is upregulated in low oxygen in a HIF-1a-dependent manner.

Rao 1 1 Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India; 2 CIRBSc, Jamia Millia Islamia New Delhi India, New Delhi, India Introduction: Background: The clinical forms of leprosy consist of a spectrum that reflects the host's immune response to the M. leprae; it provides an ideal model to study the host pathogen interaction and immunological dysregulation in humans. IL-10 and TGF-b producing Tregs are high in leprosy patients and responsible for immune suppression and M. leprae specific T cells anergy. In leprosy, involvement of IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs remains unstudied. Objectives: This is the first study in case of leprosy describing the role of IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs in the disease progression. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from leprosy patients were isolated and stimulated with M. leprae antigen (MLCwA) for 48h. Expression of PD-1 on CD4 + CD25 + Tregs, CD19 + cells and its ligand (PD-L1) on B cells, CD11c cells were evaluated by flow cytometry (FACS). Intracellular cytokine IL-35 was evaluated in CD4 + CD25 + Tregs, CD19 + cells by FACS. Serum IL-35 level was estimated by ELISA.Results: The frequency of IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs cells were found to be high in leprosy patients (p < 0.0001) as compared to healthy controls. These cells produced suppressive cytokine IL-35 which showed positive correlation with bacteriological index (BI) and TGF-b producing Tregs, indicating its suppressive nature. We showed higher expression of PD-1 on Tregs, B cell and its ligand (PD-L1) on antigen presenting cells in leprosy patients.Conclusion: This study point out a shift in our understanding of the immunological features that mediate and regulate the immune suppression and T cell anergy in leprosy patients with a new paradigm (IL-35 producing Tregs and Bregs) that is beyond TGF-b and IL-10 producing Treg cells.Disclosure of Interest: None declared.

Jones Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom Introduction: Class-I MHC-restricted T-cell associated molecule (CRTAM) is an activation-induced surface receptor that regulates T-cell development and proliferation. CRTAM + CD4 + T-cells secrete IFN-k and express cytotoxic T-cell-related genes. Currently, the mechanism of CRTAM regulation remains unknown. Here, using an unbiased transcriptomic approach, we investigated the role of IL-6 and IL-27 on CRTAM expression in CD4 + T-cells and examined the impact of CRTAM + CD4 + T-cells in inflammatory arthritis. Methods: Na\u00efve CD4 T-cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence or absence of IL-6 or IL-27. Changes in CRTAM together with markers of T-cell activation, cytokine release and proliferation/survival were analysed by flow cytometry, qPCR and ELISA. The in vivo regulation of CRTAM was monitored by immunohistochemistry of joint sections from antigeninduced-arthritis treated mice. Results: Activation of na\u00efve CD4 T-cells caused a temporal increase in CRTAM surface expression. Maximal expression was observed 18 h post-stimulation. Treatment with IL-6 and IL-27 significantly impaired CRTAM expression (50-60%). Here, regulation of CRTAM by IL-6 and IL-27 was associated with an upregulation of Zeb1, a transcriptional repressor of CRTAM. Data will be presented showing the in vivo regulation of CRTAM in synovitis from IL6r -/and IL27r -/mice. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the regulatory effects of IL-6 and IL-27 on CRTAM expression in na\u00efve CD4 T-cells and provide the first evidence of CRTAM + CD4 + T-cells within the inflamed synovium.

Wani Bone research laboratory, National Centre For Cell Science, PUNE, IndiaIntroduction: Interleukin-3 (IL-3), a cytokine secreted by mast cells and activated T helper (Th) cells, functions as a link between immune and hematopoietic system. Cross talk between immune and bone cells have been shown to play a crucial role in the regulation of bone homeostasis. Studies from our group showed that IL-3 is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoblast differentiation from human mesenchymal stem cells. Additionally, IL-3 reduced proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-17A, TNF-a, and IL-1) levels, and restored regulatory T cells (Tregs) percentage in thymus and in secondary lymphoid organs of collagen-induced arthritic mice(Srivastava et al., 2011). Tregs and Th17 cells share common lineage, but their developmental pathways are reciprocally regulated; and the balance between these two cell types is critically required for maintaining immune homeostasis. The present study highlights the effect of IL-3 on the differentiation of induced Tregs and Th17 cells.Methods: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized venous blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation. To determine the effect of IL-3 on induced Tregs and Th17 cells; naive (CD4 + CD25 -CD45RA + ), memory (CD4 + CD25 -CD45RA -) Th cells were cultured in induced Tregs (rhTGFb1 and rhIL-2) and Th17 cells polarizing condition (rhIL-1b, rhIL-23, rhIL-6, and rhTGF-b1) in the presence or absence of IL-3. Natural Tregs were expanded in the presence of rhIL-2 with or without IL-3. Expression of IL-3Ra, FoxP3 and immunosuppressive molecules like TGF-b1 and CTLA-4 was analysed by flow cytometry. Statistical significance was calculated by one way ANOVA with subsequent post hoc Tukey's test for multiple comparisons.",

P101 THE MECHANISM OF PATHOGENICITY OF IL-17 IN CNS AUTO-IMMUNITY A. McGinley * , K. Mills School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland Introduction: IL-17 and IL-17-producing CD4 + T cells (Th17 cells) and cd T cells are emerging as central players in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. Targeting the inflammatory IL-23/IL-17 axis has shown remarkable effectiveness in the treatment of psoriasis, and promising initial results in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have also been reported. MS is a demyelinating inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), involving autoreactive T cell responses to myelin antigens.Methods: The murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), was used in this study to examine the role of IL-17A in the development of CNS inflammation. Active EAE was induced in WT and IL-17A -/mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on day 0, with pertussis toxin administered on days 0 and 2 post-immunization. EAE was also induced by the adoptive transfer of IL-1b and IL-23-stimulated T cells from MOGimmunized donor mice into recipient mice. Disease severity was assessed according to the EAE clinical scores as follows: 0 -no clinical signs, 1 -limp tail, 2 -ataxic gait, 3 -hind limb weakness, 4 -hind limb paralysis, 5 -tetra paralysis/moribund.Results: Compared to WT control mice, IL-17A -/mice had significantly less severe EAE, with a delayed onset and reduced clinical severity, showing that IL-17A has a pathogenic role in this disease. Consistent with this, there were significantly fewer CD4 and cd T cells secreting GM-CSF, IL-17A, IL-17F or IFN-k in the lymph nodes of IL-17A -/mice compared with WT mice during the induction phase of EAE, and in the CNS during the acute phase of disease. Furthermore, WT mice treated with a neutralizing",

Up-regulation of FSP-1 could promote the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. The proliferation of the co-cultured MDA-MB-231cells was significantly greater than the single cultured MDA-MB-231 cells (P < 0.05). We observed that FSP-1, a fibroblast-specific protein, was expressed in the co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but FSP-1 was not detected in the single cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, which suggested that phenotype transformation happened to MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, an epithelial tumor type. The phenotype transformation is a malignant signal of breast cancer. Expression of FSP-1 were significantly up-regulated in the breast cancer tissue of the co-growth of MDA-MB-231 cells with ESF cells of tumorburdened nude mice compared with the single growth of MDA-MB-231 cells (P < 0.05). The high expression of FSP-1 significantly accelerated breast cancer growth in the co-growth group of tumorburdened nude mice, compared with the single growth group (P < 0.05).Conclusion: The up-regulation of FSP-1 in the co-culture or cogrowth fibroblasts with breast cancer cells promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro and the growth of breast cancer in tumor-burdened nude mice.

Artis 2 1 Microbiology & Immunology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; 2 Joan and Sanford I. Weill Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University, New York, United States Introduction: The transcription factor Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-1 (STAT1) is a critical component of the host innate immune response to pathogen invasion. Following viral infection of host cells, STAT1 activation by type 1 and 3 interferon (IFN) rapidly induces expression of IFN-stimulated response elements and IFN-stimulated genes. Coordination of these signaling pathways protects the host from viral-induced tissue damage and contributes to activation of adaptive immune responses. Methods: We use a combination of in vivo and in vitro infection with the intestinal pathogen Murine Norovirus (MNV) to interrogate the consequence of STAT1-deficiency on the initiation and resolution of enteric antiviral immunity.",

Their molecular regulation, however, is not fully understood. Here we investigated the role of Src Family Kinases (SFKs), a group of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, in pDC responses to toll like receptor (TLR) stimulation.Methods:We assessed the SFK mRNA expression in FACS-purified pDCs and in a human pDC cell line (CAL-1) by quantitative real-time PCR. To uncover the SFK role in IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine production following TLR7/9 stimulation or in vivo murine cytomegalovirus infection in both murine and human pDCs, we used a combination of experimental approaches consisting of genetic ablation of selected SFKs and chemical inhibition with either a pan-SFKs inhibitor or a selective dual BCR-ABL/LYN inhibitor (i.e. bafetinib, currently in phase II clinical trial). IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine production were assessed by ELISA, IFN-I bioassay and flow cytometry, while the effects of SFK activity inhibition on the signaling elements downstream TLR activation were assessed by flow cytometry and western blot.",

Prior treatment of IFIT1 depleted cells with recombinant IFN-b reversed the enhanced replication of B. cenocepacia, indicating a role for autocrine IFN-b in controlling B. cenocepacia infection and the requirement for IFIT1 in interferon induction in response to bacterial infection. Although the role of IFIT1 in restricting viral replication in mammalian cells has been previously established, a direct requirement for IFIT1 in the induction of IFNb1 expression has not been reported. In addition, we show for the first time the restriction of replication of B. cenocepacia in IFIT1-depleted macrophages. Conclusion: IFIT1 modulates the proinflammatory and antiviral gene programs in differentiated macrophage cells. Disclosure of Interest: S.

DCs are comprised of multiple functionally different DC subsets with skin-draining LN containing both migratory DCs (Langerhans cells, dermal DCs and CD103 + DCs) and lymph node-resident DCs. Despite advanced knowledge about their origin and transcriptional requirements, their relative roles in T cell priming particularly in the context of a peripheral infection remain poorly defined.Methods:We utilized a mouse model of localised epidermal HSV-1 infection, in which the virus gains access to the innervating sensory nerve endings and eventually returns to the skin to cause a zosteriform lesion at the flank. Using in vivo mouse models with complete or conditional depletion of various DC subsets (eg. Irf8 -/and Langerin-DTR), cytokine receptors (Ifnar2 -/-), and mice expressing diphtheria toxin under the control of the ROSA26 locus (RDTA), the role of direct infection of DCs and cross-presentation was examined.",

Fitzgerald-Bocarsly 1 1 Pathology, United States; 2 Medicine, United States; 3 Pediatrics, Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark, United StatesIntroduction: Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs) are potent producers of type-1 interferons (IFN) and are vital to a successful antiviral immune response. Recent studies have shown pDCs also play an important role in antifungal immunity. Here, we demon-strate the ability of human pDCs to uptake and kill fungal spores, and characterize expression of the C-type Lectin Receptor (CLR) Dectin-1, which we have identified as a likely receptor used to recognize fungal antigen. We also compare Dectin-1 expression between chronic HIV-infected patients and healthy controls, due to the observation that HIV patients experience chronic immune activation and pDC dysregulation that may compromise pDC antifungal capability.Methods: Aspergillus fumigatus spores were labeled with Fluorescent Aspergillus Reporter (FLARE), a tracking system composed of intracellular DSRed and extracellular AF633 signal. When spores are killed, only DSRed signal is quenched, allowing the user to track the presence and viability of spores using flow cytometry. FLARElabeled Aspergillus spores were incubated with healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in either physiologic (37\u00b0C) or cold (4\u00b0C) conditions. After 6 h, pDCs were evaluated for acquisition of FLARE signal. To investigate pDC Dectin-1 expression, we used flow cytometry to measure Dectin-1 protein levels on the pDC cell surface at baseline and in response to HSV, HIV MN , and AT2-HIV MN stimulation. To evaluate Dectin-1 functionality, we stimulated pDCs with curdlan, a specific Dectin-1 agonist, and measured the upregulation of costimulatory markers, Dectin-1, and cytokine production. Finally, we compared pDCs of individuals with chronic HIV to those of healthy controls for the expression and regulation of Dectin-1 at baseline or after stimulation with curdlan, HSV, HIV MN , or AT2-HIV MN .",

Thirty eight interleukins have been described. Recently, we reported the identification of a novel cytokine, Meteorin-like (Metrnl), for which we have proposed the name IL-39 to reflect its association with the immune system. Methods: Macrophages: Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages (BMDM) were stimulated with TNFa, IL-4, IL-17a, IL-12, IL-6, IL-10, IFN? or TGF\u00df (50 ng/mL, BioLegend) for 24 h prior to analysis of Metrnl levels in supernatant samples by ELISA.",

Interestingly, IL-17A deficient R161H T cells polarized under Th17 conditions produced elevated amounts of other Th17related cytokines, i.e. IL-17F, GM-CSF and IL-22. Conversely, supplementing Th17 polarization cultures of IL-17A deficient T cells with recombinant IL-17A, reduced the elevated production of those cytokines. RNA-Seq analysis identified a novel candidate regulatory mediator involved in control of the IL-17 cytokine program by IL-17. Conclusion: These data suggest that: (a) IL-17A itself is not necessary for the pathogenicity of uveitogenic Th17 cells in this model and (b) that IL-17A exerts feedback inhibition on Th17 cells to control their expression of other Th17-related cytokines.

In contrast, TNF displays only an early LPS transient followed by complete late LPS tolerance. PMA induces only decreased late continuous IL1B expression, with negligible induction of TNF.Methods: IL1B and TNF gene mRNA kinetics.Results: The use of specific transcription factor inhibitors reveals that the early LPS IL1B mRNA transient is dependent on both NF-jB and C/EBPb. In contrast, late continuous IL1B expression is independent of NF-jB, but requires HIF-1a and C/EBPb. The delayed PMA IL1B response recapitulates only the late LPS continuous response, except that NF-jB is required in addition to HIF-1a and C/EBPb. This contrasts with early LPS induction of TNF, which is almost exclusively dependent on NF-jB.Conclusion:Our results suggest that succinate-dependent HIF-1a replaces NF-jB during LPS sustained late induction of IL1B. Unlike LPS IL1B induction, the observation that the PMA late phase requires NF-jB suggests that this factor may play a role in early priming of the LPS IL1B late phase. LPS re-stimulation 24 h after the first treatment generates an IL1B mRNA kinetic similar to that of the initial LPS challenge, i.e., an early transient followed by decreased late expression, while TNF continues to exhibit LPS tolerance. Extracellular succinate appears to play a role in the 24-h LPS restimulation of IL1B, likely via HIF-1a, suggesting a macrophage quorum response during innate immune memory.",

We are studying the role of MAM in coordinating RLR signaling.Methods: We are using confocal and high-resolution microscopy as well as biochemical analysis to study MAM composition. CRISPR Cas9 mediated knockout of factors either involved in MAM integrity or directly involved in signaling and measurement of IFN stimulated gene (ISG) induction upon virus infection will clarify their specific role in antiviral innate immunity.Results: Upon RNA virus infection and binding to PAMP RNA, RIG-I forms a translocation complex, translocates from the cytosol to MAM, and binds to the mitochondria antiviral signaling (MAVS) adaptor protein to induce immune activation. Further observations supportive of a central role of MAM for innate immune signaling, include modulation of MAM morphology altering antiviral immunity and virus-evolved strategies counteracting innate immune signaling from this compartment like the Hepatitis C Virus NS3/4A protease which specifically targets MAM-MAVS for cleavage. Here, we reveal the dynamics of RIG-I and MDA5 MAM interaction upon PAMP sensing during acute virus infection. We show that while signaling by each RLR induces the expression of an overlapping set of genes in the infected cell, each RLR also directs the expression of unique gene sets. Our analysis will be enlarged to clarify the role of LGP2 in these processes.Conclusion: Thus, the MAM is a platform for RLR signaling that directs differential gene expression from RIG-I versus MDA5/MAVS interaction. Modifying MAM structural integrity alters RLR signaling.Defining events taking place at the MAM and initiating productive immune responses may open new possibilities for therapeutic targets.

Lindqvist, J. Vince * The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, AustraliaIntroduction: Caspase-1 is activated by inflammasome protein complexes in response to the detection of pathogen molecules, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or cellular stressors. Activated caspase-1 subsequently cleaves and thereby activates precursor IL-1b and induces it secretion. At the same time, active caspase-1 can induce a lytic cell death program, termed pyroptosis. Whether the act of cell death is necessary for IL-1b release remains controversial. Similarly, how other cell death signaling pathways, such as mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)-dependent necroptotic cell death, lead to inflammasome and IL-1b activation remains unclear. Here we explore, at the single cell level, (i) whether cell death is required for bioactive IL-1b secretion and (ii) the mechanism by which the necroptotic effector molecule, MLKL, activates inflammasome complexes in a cell intrinsic manner.",

Specifically, we define a novel pathway by which the necroptotic cell death effector molecule, mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), can signal inflammasome and IL-1b activation independent of necroptotic-induced damageassociated molecular pattern (DAMP) release.Conclusion: Although caspase-1 induced cell death and IL-1b release are often observed at the same time, the act of cell death is not requisite for IL-1b secretion. On the other hand, cell death signaling pathways, including MLKL-mediated necroptosis, can activate inflammasome protein complexes to drive IL-1b responses in a cell intrinsic manner. of Interest: None declared.MODIFICATION OF ACUTE INFLAMMATION ASA CONSEQUENCE OF RECURRENT INFLAMMATORY CHALLENGE J.

Eitson, J.W. Schoggins Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, United StatesIntroduction: The type I interferon (IFN) response is the primary cellular defense mechanism against viruses. IFN protects against viral infection by activating expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which have potent antiviral effector activity. Our recent screening efforts to identify novel antiviral ISGs unexpectedly uncovered a small subset of genes that enhanced viral infectivity. The goals of this project are to characterize the mechanism of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E), an ISG that enhanced unrelated viruses from multiple families.Methods: We used common genetic approaches (ectopic expression and CRISPR/Cas9) in cell culture to study the impact of LY6E gain or loss of expression on viral infection. Viral readouts included flow cytometry-based detection of viral reporters or viral antigen, and plaque assays to monitor virus production. To study LY6E mechanism of action in the context of the viral life cycle, we used qRT-PCR to monitor viral binding, a subgenomic viral replicon to assess viral replication, and pharmacological inhibitors or ImageStream analysis to study viral entry.Results: Here we show that ectopic expression of LY6E enhances cellular infection by a subset of enveloped RNA viruses from diverse families, including Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Togaviridae. The enhancement phenotype is dependent on cell lineage, with the strongest effects seen in fibroblast and monocytic cell lines. Ablation of endogenous LY6E by CRISPR/Cas9 reduces but does not abrogate viral infectivity, indicating that LY6E is important for optimal infection. Loss of LY6E does not alter antiviral protection by IFN, suggesting that the enhancing effects may be direct. Mechanistic studies reveal that LY6E enhances infectivity at an early step in the viral life cycle, after viral binding but prior to establishment of replication. Visualization of single cell infections by ImageStream confirms that LY6E enhances viral entry. Further analysis of entry assays indicate that LY6E expression dually enhances the percentage of cells infected and the rate at which virus enters individual cells.Conclusion: We conclude that LY6E enhances viral uptake at the population level, which may be important for initiation of the cellmediated antiviral immune response. Understanding the mechanism and significance of LY6E to the antiviral interferon response may aid in the development of novel antiviral therapeutics.Results: sIL-15 complexes were increased in serum of WT mice as early as 12 h post treatment STING treatment and remained elavated at 24 h. This STING-mediated induction of sIL-15 complexes was completely abrogated in IFNAR-/-mice. STING agonists acted directly on dendritic cells as sIL-15 complexes were induced in BM-derived DCs. In vivo, induction of sIL-15 complexes in response to STING agonist was impaired in mice conditionally deleted of IL-15Ra by CD11c+ cells or LysM+ cells suggesting DCs and macrophages are major sources of sIL-15 complexes in response to STING stimulation. In response to Ab-mediated T cell depletion or total body irradiation, optimal induction of sIL-15 complexes in response to Ab-mediated T cell depletion or total body irradiation was dependent on the STING pathway suggesting products of cell death induce sIL-15 complexes in response to lymphodepletion.Conclusion: Altogether, these results demonstrate that the stimulation of the STING pathway is one inflammatory event that leads to the generation of soluble IL-15 complexes, which acts during lymphodepletion and other situations associated with enhanced cellular death. Since the sIL-15 complexes produced are likely contributing to enhanced CD8 T cell and NK cell responses, these findings have revealed a new mechanim by which the STING pathway can enhance immune responses.Disclosure of Interest: None declared.MACROPHAGES AREA CENTRAL HUB OF INNATE IMMUNITY AND INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING PROGRAMS INDUCED BY HCV INFEC-TION L.D.

Our previous studies have shown that sIL-15 complexes are induced by various inflammatory stimuli, such as type I IFNs. Since activation of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is important for regulating type I Interferons (IFN), we set out to determine if sIL-15 complexes are regulated by STING signaling. Since production of sIL-15 complexes is also induced upon total body irradiation and is partially dependent on type I interferons (IFN), we also investigated the role of STING in inducing sIL-15 complexes after lymphodepletion. 1 University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; 2 NIH, Bethesda, United States; 3 Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec City, Canada; 4 USDA, Beltsville, United States Introduction: Survival of the host relies on the establishment of a functional barrier immune defense that must be maintained in fluctuating states of food availability. Innate lymphoid cells (ILC) are an important component of tissue immunity involved in the maintenance and repair of tissue barriers such as the lung, skin and intestine but how their function is metabolically controlled is unknown.Methods: To test the metabolic regulation of ILC2 we used fluorescently labeled fatty acids or glucose together with pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid uptake, fatty acid metabolism and glycolysis in models of helminth infection and malnutrition (vitamin A deficiency). In addition we analyzed the cytokine levels and cellular source by ELISA and flow cytometry and performed extracellular flux analysis and quantitative PCR to reveal the metabolic regulation on a cellular level.Results: We found that ILC2 take up high amounts of fatty acid from the environment and predominantly depend on fatty acid metabolism during helminth infection. Ablation of fatty acid metabolism or dietary fat adsorption impairs the ILC2 mediated immune response and expulsion of tissue dwelling parasites. Furthermore, in situations where an essential nutrient, such as vitamin A, is limited, ILC2 increase in numbers, sustain their function and selectively maintain IL-13 production via increased acquisition and utilization of fatty acid. This metabolic adaptation of ILC2 is regulated on a cellular level by an increase in genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and a corresponding decrease in genes regulating glycolysis.Conclusion: Together, these results reveal that ILC2 depend on fatty acid metabolism to mediate barrier immunity in the context of helminth infection and malnutrition. Thus we identified an important mechanism that allows the host through metabolic adaptation to maintain barrier immunity and to promote host survival in the face of limited nutritional availability.",

ILCs are classified into three groups based of their cytokine expression patterns. Among ILCs, group 2 ILC (ILC2) including natural helper (NH) cells, nuocytes and innate helper type 2 (Ih2) cells produce type 2 cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13 in response to IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) that are produced by epithelial cells. We have focused on the regulatory mechanisms of ILC2 functions in helminth infection and allergic inflammation.Methods: We employed a parasitic infection model with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and an allergic infllamation model with Alternaria alternata to examine the activation mechanisms of NH cells or ILC2.Results: We found that the corticosteroid-resistance observed as a result of airway inflammation triggered by sensitization and exposure to allergen is induced via the IL-33/ILC2 axis. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) synthesized during airway inflammation plays a pivotal role in the induction of ILC2 corticosteroid resistance in vitro and in vivo, by controlling phosphorylation of Stat5. Blockade of TSLP/Stat5 signaling pathway restores corticosteroid sensitivity. We also examined the regulatory mechanisms of ILC2 functions and demonstrate here that tissue-resident ILC2 proliferate in situ without migration during inflammatory responses. Both type I and type II IFNs, and interleukin-27 (IL-27) strongly suppressed proliferation and function of ILC2 in a Stat1-dependent manner. ILC2-mediated lung inflammation was enhanced in the absence of IFN-k receptor on ILC2 in vivo, demonstrating the importance of endogenous IFN-k in the termination of ILC2-mediated inflammation. IFN-k effectively suppressed the function of ILC2 but not inflammatory ILC2 induced by IL-25, and IL-27 suppressed ILC2 but not T H 2 in Alternaria-induced lung inflammation.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that TSLP is a Stat5-dependent activator for ILC2 and Stat1-dependent suppression by IFN and IL-27-is a negative feedback mechanism for ILC2 function in vivo.Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Identifying patients at risk of adverse outcomes is crucial in acute medicine. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a wellestablished biomarker widely used in clinical routine as a marker of infection and inflammation, while soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a novel inflammatory biomarker associated with immune activation, disease severity, and mortality. Here, we aimed to compare suPAR and CRP and their association to mortality in acute medical patients.Methods: This study included 17,312 unselected patients who were admitted to the acute medical department between November 18th 2013 and September 30th 2015 at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Denmark. CRP and suPAR were measured as a part of the standard admission blood test panel. Follow-up information, including diagnoses and vital status, was extracted from national Danish registries after 30 days. Statistical analysis was performed using correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and Cox regression analysis. Results are presented as medians with interquartile range (IQR), Kendall's tau b correlation coefficients, and hazard ratios (HRs) or area under the curves (AUCs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Median CRP was 5.0 mg/l (IQR 1.0-31.0, n = 16,817) and median suPAR was 2.8 ng/ml (IQR 1.9-4.3, n = 17,312). CRP and suPAR were positively correlated (tau b 0.36, P < 0.0001), but 1155 patients (6.9%) had low CRP (<10 mg/l) and high suPAR (=4.5 ng/ml).CRP and suPAR were both negatively correlated with lymphocyte count (tau b -0.22 and -0.20, respectively) and eosinophils (-0.17 and -0.11), and positively correlated with total leukocyte count (0.27 and 0.14), monocytes (0.28 and 0.16), and neutrophils (0.32 and 0.18) (All P < 0.0001).Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Many immunosuppressive therapeutics for autoimmune diseases can have the side effect of inhibiting immune responses that control infection and tumors. Induction of autoantigen-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells has the capacity to specifically suppress immune responses to self-antigens without affecting response to foreign antigens and has been dubbed the 'holy grail' of autoimmune disease therapy. However the induction of autoantigen-specific Treg cells is not straightforward.",

Methods: CD14 + + CD16classical monocytes (CLs) and CD14 dim CD16 + non-classical monocytes (NCLs) from SLE patients were purified by magnetic separation. The Fluidigm single cell capture and Rt-PCR system was used to quantify expression of 87 monocyte-related genes.Results: NCL monocytes had higher IFN scores than CL monocytes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the entire data set demonstrated two unique clusters found only in SLE patients, one related to high disease activity and one related to prednisone use. Independent clusters in the SLE patients were related to disease activity (SLEDAI",
