This was documented by visualization of the 70 nm agent in 42% of 143 children from whom a stool or rectal swab was available and by demonstration of a fourfold or greater rise in complement fixing antibody to the HRVLA and/or NCDV in 44% of 117 children with appropriate sera. Sixty-one percent of 118 children studied from the months of November through May were infected whereas none of 34 studied from June through October had evidence of infection. Only 8% of 76 control patients studied during the two study periods were found to be infected; one of these, who also shed the HRVLA, had diarrhea at the time of admission. Among the patients with gastroenteritis, 13% of the 72 who had infection with HRVLA also had some other potential intestinal pathogen, whereas 55% of the 80 who did not have HRVLA infection had a potential intestinal pathogen (Table II) . None of 275 stool bacterial isolates from 29 patients admitted with diarrhea during the cooler months (November through April) and from three patients admitted during the warmer months produced heat labile toxin? The greater frequency of Shigella and Salmonella isolates in the children with no HRVLA infection is probably indicative of a true etiologic role for these agents. Since We were not studying anal swabs from hospitalized controls by conventional virologic techniques, we cannot say what the incidence of adenovirus or enterovirus recovery would have been in controls. However, serum samples were available from controls and we compared the serologic response to an adenovirus type 2 group CF antigen in paired sera of controls with those of the study patients. Three (3.6%) of 83 patients with gastroenteritis and two (2.7%) of 75 control patients had a fourfold or greater rise in adenovirus CF antibody.",
