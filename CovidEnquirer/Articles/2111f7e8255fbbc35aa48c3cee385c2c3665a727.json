On June 11, 2009 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a phase-6 pandemic alert, indicating a global pandemic. The earliest virus isolates were sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) zanamivir and oseltamivir, but resistant to M2 inhibitors, such as amantadine and rimantadine (1, [3] [4] [5] . Thus, the NAIs have been used globally for treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infl ection.",

The OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses have a specifi c NA mutation, a histidine-to-tyrosine substitution at amino acid position 275 (N1 numbering, H275Y), that confers resistance to oseltamivir. In a report of 39 OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases (as of October 22, 2009) , 16 were associated with treatment, 13 were associated with postexposure prophylaxis, 3 were in NAIuntreated patients, and 7 were of unknown association (8) . Preliminary global NAI surveillance showed 190 OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections among >15,000 clinical specimens; thus, the global frequency of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was <1.5% (as of January 8, 2010) (9) . These reports indicated that human-to-human transmission of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was limited but that oseltamivir treatment and prophylaxis could lead to emergence of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.",

Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Thus, Japan is a high-risk environment for the development of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus because of drug use pressure. The emergence of such resistance is alarming, because OR seasonal infl uenza A (H1N1) viruses can rapidly spread worldwide once they acquire the capacity for human-to-human transmission (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Additionally, in the 2009-10 season in Japan, almost all cases of infl uenza were caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses ( Figure 1 ). Thus, close surveillance must be maintained to detect pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and changes in its transmissibility and genetic and antigenic characteristics. We monitored and characterized 4,307 clinical specimens collected in Japan during May 2009-February 2010 from patients with OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 by NA sequencing, NAI assay, or both. Of them, we found 61 OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses with the H275Y mutation.",

Other sporadic and some shared amino acid change(s) were observed in the NA protein of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, but these changes apparently did not restore viral fi tness, because no effi ciently transmissible OR pandemic (H1N1) virus was found.

However, the frequency of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in each day of treatment with oseltamivir could not be calculated because of a lack of treatment history data. This timing is consistent with that for OR seasonal infl uenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses, which typically emerge 3-6 days after oseltamivir treatment (36) (37) (38) . Additionally, we also observed the rapid emergence of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus within 48 hours of oseltamivir exposure (39) . Nontheless, 6 cases occurred in untreated patients. Indeed, the OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the Oita case may likely be a natural occurrence. We are aware of only 2 other reports, one from Vietnam and one from Hong Kong, of naturally occurring OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in untreated patients (7, 40) .",

In both, the immune systems of all patients were severely compromised or suppressed, indicating that these patients had an increased risk for not only the emergence of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, but also OR seasonal infl uenza (H1N1) virus (31, 32) . In contrast, particular attention should be paid to the Vietnamese case because a naturally occurring OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus caused a cluster of 7 cases in immunocompetent patients with no history of oseltamivir use (40) .",

Additionally, as fi rst priority for prophylaxis of both OR and OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection should be vaccination, but not antiviral agents. Conversely, a preclinical animal model showed that OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had high potential to acquire transmissibility without losing viral fi tness (24) (25) (26) . Whether and how OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 may acquire effi cient transmissibility among humans are not known. Thus, vigilant monitoring of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection and alterations in its transmissibility and antigenic and genetic characteristics is essential.",

The sampling month of each isolate is listed following the strain name. The phylogenetic tree of NA and HA genes was constructed by using the neighbor-joining method. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site.infl uenza symptoms developed on July 15. OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was detected in a sample taken on July 16, before oseltamivir use. However, symptoms had developed in the index patient's son on July 11; the boy received zanamivir on July 12 (OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was not detected from a sample taken that day). No reports have indicated that zanamivir can induce OR virus with the H275Y mutation. The OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus may have thus emerged naturally, with no selective pressure. However, the index patient may have been exposed to an oseltamivir-treated person outside of her household who harbored OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.Genetic AnalysisPhylogenetic analyses of the HA and NA genes showed that most shared amino acid changes: S203T in HA and V106I and N248D in NA(Figure 3). In both trees, OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolates were genetically scattered and possessed several sporadic amino acid changes, but each OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was genetically close to OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (Figure 3). Several OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolates from Japan were also closely related to OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolates from other countries.Analysis of the genomes of representative OR (n = 20) and OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (n = 138) provided further insight into their similarities.
