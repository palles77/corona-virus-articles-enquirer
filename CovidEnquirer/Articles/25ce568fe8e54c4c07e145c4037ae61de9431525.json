Although the C-terminal part of US11 was responsible for its nucleolar localization, the precise nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) of US11 and its nuclear import and export mechanisms are still elusive. In this study, fluorescence microscopy was employed to investigate the subcellular localization of US11 and characterize its transport mechanism in living cells. By constructing a series of deletion mutants fused with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), three novel NoLSs of US11 were for the first time mapped to amino acids 84-125, 126-152, and 89-146, respectively. Additionally, the NES was identified to locate between amino acids 89 and 119. Furthermore, the US11 protein was demonstrated to target to the cytoplasm through the NES by chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-independent pathway, and to the nucleolus through Ran and importin \u2424-dependent mechanism that does not require importin \u24235.",

During productive infection, the 152-kb double-stranded HSV-1 genome is rapidly translocated to the nucleus and encodes approximately 80 genes in a coordinately activated cascade that consists of the sequential expression of immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L) genes. It has been shown that approximately half of these genes are not essential for replication of the virus in cell culture (Roizman et al., 2007) . These dispensable gene products are, however, thought to be important for virus growth and spread in the natural host.",

Additionally, US11 is a RNA-binding protein, which can bind a limited number of cellular and viral RNAs in a sequence-and conformation-specific manner (Diaz et al., 1996; Roizman, 1990, 1991) . Structurefunction analysis has demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal half of US11 is required to bind RNA, localize to nucleolus, associate with ribosomes (Roller et al., 1996) and interact with protein kinase R (PKR) and the PKR activator PACT (Cassady and Gross, 2002) . Furthermore, several cellular factors have been identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen to interact with the US11 protein, such as kinesin light-chain-related protein PAT1 (Benboudjema et al., 2003) and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase HIPK2 (Giraud et al., 2004) . It was shown recently that US11expression enhanced the recovery of cellular protein synthesis, increased cell survival in response to thermal stress and also protected against staurosporine induced apoptosis (Javouhey et al., 2008) . Therefore, it is clear that US11 is a multifunctional protein involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and in biological processes related to the survival of cells following environmental stress.",

A cluster of basic amino acids is responsible for targeting proteins to the nucleus or nucleolus (Kaffman and O'Shea, 1999) . Active nuclear import of proteins is mediated by NLSs, which are then recognized by proteins of the importin super-family (importin \u2423 and \u2424) that mediate the transport across the nuclear envelope using Ran-GTP (Bednenko et al., 2003) . Similar to nuclear import, export of a protein from nucleus depends on the presence of a specific nuclear export signal (Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996) . Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of protein and RNA molecules plays an important role in eukaryotic cell function (Ullman et al., 1997) . A related family of shuttling transport factors, importins and exportins, recognizes NLS or NES containing proteins and coordinates trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1; exportin 1) has been identified as an export receptor that recognizes NES sequences directly and is responsible for the export of NES containing proteins (Ullman et al., 1997) . The pharmacological compound leptomycin B (LMB) directly interacts with CRM1 and blocks NES-mediated protein export (Fornerod et al., 1997) . Therefore, the proteins can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm with their NLSs and NESs.",

            "text": "It was reported previously that the unique XPR repeats of US11 were responsible for its nucleolar retention and nuclear export, which were identified by microinjection and cell fixation (Catez et al., 2002) . However, such in vitro techniques may alter the localization of proteins, resulting in misleading conclusions in the analysis of the intracellular distribution of a specific protein. Additionally, the precise NoLS and NES of US11 and its nuclear import and export mechanism are still elusive. Therefore, we have attempted to charaterize these signals, and the molecular mechanism responsible for its nucleolar targeting. In this report, living cells fluorescence microscopy, which is widely applied (Day and Schaufele, 2008) and developed in our group (Guo et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2004 Zheng et al., , 2005 , was employed to characterize the exact nucleolar transport mechanism of US11. By sequence analysis and constructing mutants, the precise nucleolar retentionsequences and nuclear export signal (NES) of US11 were identified, and the molecular mechanism of nucleolar transport was also elucidated.",

Immediately after transfection with pECFP-L23, Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The cells were fixed 16 h post-infection and analyzed by an immunofluorescence assay using rabbit polyclonal antibody against US11. US11 staining exhibited predominant nucleolus and cytoplasm localization ( Fig. 2A) , which is consistent with the previous report (Roller et al., 1996) . Fluorescence microscopy clearly showed the co-localization of US11 and ECFP-L23 in the nucleolus ( Fig. 2A) .

To investigate whether US11 plays a role in transporting a heterogenous protein to the nucleolus, ORF of US11 was inserted into pEYFP-N1 to generate US11-EYFP. US11 fusions with EYFP dimer (dEYFP) or trimer (tEYFP) were also constructed as shown in Fig. 2B . The subcellular localization of US11-EYFP fusion protein was imaged in live cells. Low level expression of US11-EYFP was observed in the nucleolus and cytoplasm right after removing the transfection mixtures (about 4 h after transfection), and the localization of US11-EYFP does not change after 48 h transfection (data not shown). This also confirmed that the nucleolar localization was not an artifact of high expression levels. Fig. 2C showed micrographs of COS-7 cells 24 h after transfection with plasmids encoding US11 and EYFP fusion proteins. US11 fused with one, two or three copies of EYFP showed similar patterns of localization. The fluorescence was predominantly restricted to the nucleolus and cytoplasm by US11 (Fig. 2C) . On the contrary, the fluorescence was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolar structures in cells transfected with plasmids encoding monomer EYFP (Fig. 2C) . In order to investigate whether the orientation of US11 affects its localization in cells, DNA construct was also made to express US11 fused to the C-terminus of EYFP (EYFP-US11) (Fig. 2C) . The fluorescence microscopy demonstrated identical subcellular distribution patterns of US11-EYFP and EYFP-US11, thus the following experiments were performed only for EYFP fusion to C-terminus of US11. Taken together, these results indicated that US11 was responsible for driving EYFP into the nucleolus. ",

Since US11 fusions with EYFP monomer, dimer or trimer showed similar nucleolus localization patterns, the following experiments were performed with monomer EYFP fusion. It was reported that the XPR repeats of US11 were important for its nucleolar association (Roller et al., 1996) , and the XPR motif of US11 herein started from the 84th amino acid (Fig. 1B) . So, two deletion mutants encompassing amino acids 1-83 and 84-152 in frame with EYFP (Fig. 3A) were firstly constructed to investigate their subcellular localization. US11(1-83)-EYFP showed similar subcellular distribution as EYFP, with fluorescence diffuse in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, but excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 3B) . The subcellular distribution of US11(84-152)-EYFP was identical to that of US11-EYFP (Fig. 2C) , with the fluorescence enriched to both nucleoli and cytoplasm (Fig. 3B) , indicating that the amino acids 84-152 were responsible for the nucleolar localization of US11, which is consistent with the previous report (Roller et al., 1996) .",

However, our result revealed that the fluorescence of US11(88-125)-EYFP distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and nuclear, without nucleolar enrichment (Fig. 3C) , which is not consistent with their result. These evidence demonstrated that either US11(84-125) or US11(126-152) targeted to the nucleolus with weaker enrichment, while full length XPR repeat of US11(84-152) localized to the nucleolus with stronger enrichment.

Most studies pertaining to nuclear export have implicated the CRM-1 protein in facilitating the export of NES-containing proteins. An antibiotic compound, LMB, has been found to specifically inhibit CRM-1-mediated nuclear export (Fornerod et al., 1997; Ullman et al., 1997) . To investigate the nuclear export mechanism of US11, LMB treatment was performed after transfection of US11- The results showed that the nuclear export activities of US11 and its NES were not affected by a treatment with LMB at 20 ng ml \u22121 after transfection (Fig. 6) . In contrast, the LMB treatment could completely abolished the nuclear export of pRev-NES-EGFP containing Leucine-rich NES (Williams et al., 2008) . The evidence indicated that the export of US11 from the nucleolous to the cytoplasm is CRM-1 independent.",

            "text": "As a multifunctional viral protein, the US11 protein is well conserved between HSV-1 and -2 (63% homology), with the greater variation at the N terminus. There are no US11 homologues in other neurotropic herpesviruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV), bovine herpesvirus (BoHV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV). The US11 protein is among the most-abundant viral proteins present in cells late in infection and is packaged in the tegument of the native virions to be delivered into cells after infection (Roller et al., 1996) . Soon after infection, the US11 protein is found in the cytoplasm, either as heterogeneous oligomers or associated with ribosomes or both (Diaz et al., 1993; Roller and Roizman, 1992) . Later during infection, the US11 protein accumulates into nucleoli and is also found in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fibrils as well as in clusters of interchromatin granules (Giraud et al., 2004) . It was reported that HSV-1 infection affected the nucleolus, a prominent nuclear sub-structure implicated in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), cell cycle regulation and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (Besse and Puvion-Dutilleul, 1996; Boisvert et al., 2007) . Nucleoli become elongated following infection, and the synthesis of mature rRNA is reduced (Besse and Puvion-Dutilleul, 1996) . Apart from US11, several other HSV-1 proteins have also been shown to localize to, or associate with, the nucleolus (Emmott and Hiscox, 2009) . The viral protein VP22 associates with the nucleolus and with dispersed nucleolin in HSV-1 infected cells (Lopez et al., 2008) , and RL1 (ICP34.5), ICP0, ICP27 and UL24 have also been shown to localize to nucleoli (Bertrand et al., 2009; Mears et al., 1995; Morency et al., 2005; Salsman et al., 2008) . Additionally, bovine infected cell protein 27 (BICP27) was, to date, the first viral protein of bovine herpesvirus type I identified to localize in the nucleoli (Guo et al., 2009) .",

Such in vitro techniques relying on analysis of exogenously expressed/purified protein and cytoplasmic factors have been previously used to characterize the different NLS-dependent nuclear import pathways, and determine basic parameters of nuclear import kinetics (Hu et al., 2005; Jans and Jans, 1994; Seydel and Jans, 1996) . However, these methods are restricted to semi-intact or damaged cell systems that use high concentrations of nuclear localizing substrates and importins. In addition, the MT network, which has been implicated in facilitating the nuclear import of several proteins (Giannakakou et al., 2000; Lam et al., 2002; Roth et al., 2007) , is either lacking or damaged in semi-intact cells in such an approach. In this study, however, the living cells fluorescence microscopy was employed for investigating the subcellular localization and nuclear import and export mechanisms of US11 protein. It is well known that living cells fluorescence microscopy has an advantage over conventional in vitro nuclear transport assays in that cells are not physically damaged by microinjection, detergent, or mechanical perforation, this means that cellular components important for trafficking, such as nuclear import and export receptors, the MT network, are intact (Dohner et al., 2002; Giannakakou et al., 2000) .",

It localized to both the nucleoli and cytoplasm in infected and transfected cells, and its C-terminal 84-152 peptide containing the XPR repeats showed identical subcellular localization to the wild-type US11. These results are in accordance with the previous reports (Diaz-Latoud et al., 1997; Diaz et al., 1996; MacLean et al., 1987) . Catez et al. reported that the nucleolar retention signal (NoLS) of US11 located between amino acids 88 and 125, which was described as a new type of bipartite, while 89-97aa and 110-118aa were deduced to be the critical parts of the NoLS (Catez et al., 2002) . However, our results showed that US11(88-125)-EYFP, US11(89-106)-EYFP and US11(110-118)-EYFP did not display any nucleolar enrichment, which are all inconsistent with their results (Catez et al., 2002) . On the contrary, US11(84-125)-EYFP and US11(126-152)-EYFP showed identical subcellular localization to US11, while US11(84-88) or US11(120-125) deletion abolished the nucleolar retention of US11(84-125), and US11(126-134) or US11(147-152) deletion destroy completely the nucleolar retention of US11(126-152), these results indicate that these short stretch aa were critical for their nucleolar localization of US11(84-125) or US11(126-152), respectively, the discrepancy between our and previous results may result from the different experimental assay as mentioned above.",

In addition, it was reported that phosphorylation of Ser 129 stimulated the NES activity of GST-US11 (Catez et al., 2002) . Interestingly, there is a site mutation in position 132 of HSV-1 strain F US11, from Ser (S) to Pro (P) (Fig. 1C) . So, the mutation of Ser into Pro may be responsible for the nucleolar localization of US11(126-152) and US11(89-146). Taken together, US11(84-125), US11(126-152) or US11(89-146), alone or in combination, contribute to the nucleolar localization of US11. These results suggested that the XPR repeat number might determine its ability to target to the nucleolus.",

Here, we mapped the NES of US11 to amino acids 89-119. In addition, the NES identified here did not display similarities with any classical leucine-rich NES. To our knowledge, the proline-rich NoLS and NES identified herein are to date novel and unique to US11 protein of HSV-1, and they may carry out their function with the conformation exhibited by unique XPR repeats. As reported previously (Diaz et al., 1996; Schaerer-Uthurralt et al., 1998) , this region may form a poly-L-proline type II helix due to the proline residue present at every third position. This putative secondary structure, a right-handed single helix characterized by three residues per turn (Williamson, 1994) , has a strong electrostatic polarity. Based on this, it is speculated that the formed helix may exhibited a special conformation for nucleolar retention and nuclear export.",

Rather, these proteins continuously shuttle between the nuclear and the cytoplasmic compartments. To date, the receptors for nuclear import and export of US11 protein are still not understood. Our results showed that the nuclear transport of the US11-EYFP fusion protein was inhibited by the Ran-GTP Q69L mutant, indicating that the US11 protein is a Ran dependent protein and is transported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm through classic nuclear transport machinery. Furthermore, cotransfection of dominant negative importins demonstrated that US11 import is mediated by an importin \u2424-dependent mechanism that does not require importin \u24235. Additionally, chemical LMB did not inhibit the exports of US 11 and its NES (89-119aa) from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm, indicating the export of US11 protein do not achieved through its direct interaction with the nuclear export receptor CRM1.",
