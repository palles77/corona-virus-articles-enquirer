Several prevalent murine pathogens cause alterations of the respiratory system that can confuse the assessment of chemically induced airway ixjury. In some instances the pathogenesis ofinfection with these agents has been relatively well studied in the lower respiratory tract. However, there are few well-controlled studies that have examined the upper respiratory region, which result in interpretive problems for toxicologic pathologists. The conduct and interpretation ofboth short-term and chronic rodent bioassays can be compromised by both the clinical and subclinical manifestations of infectious diseases. This paper reviews several important infectious diseases of the upper airway of rats and mice and discusses the potential influence of these conditions on the results of toxicology studies.",

Many factors, such as inhalation caging; cage rotation schemes; inhalation chamber microenvironments; food and water deprivation during exposures; and stresses from crowding, frequent handling, and servicing of animals, all play important roles in the interplay between pathogen and chemical exposure.",

All three agents cause significant rodent respiratory disease, with lesions in the upper airways, including the nasal passages. In addition to being a common site for microbial-induced disease, the upper respiratory tract is a target organ of chemically induced injury. This paper will review the respiratory pathology of several important murine pathogens and discuss their importance in toxicology and carcinogenicity studies.",

Respiratory tract lesions are generally confined to the upper airway and usually precede the inflammatory changes that occur in the exocrine tissues of the head (6). Gross lesions consisting of edematous and/or inflammatory changes are sometimes noted in extrarespiratory tissue in mixed or serous salivary glands, exorbital lacrimal glands, Harderian glands, periglandular connective tissue, cervical lymph nodes, or the thymus. EVERI1T AND RICHTER Microscopic lesions in experimental SDAV infection begin in the nasal respiratory epithelium approximately 48 hr postinfection. Initial respiratory epithelial necrosis accompanied by congestion and edema is rapidly followed by a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria. Necrosis primarily occurs in the respiratory epithelium lining the ventral turbinates and lateral wall of the nasal cavity but usually spares the olfactory mucosa. The nasal meatuses may be filled with exudate composed of necrotic epithelial cells admixed with inflammatory cells and mucus. Serous mucosal glands of the nasopharynx generally sustain relatively mild injury (6) , although necrosis of ducts and acini does occur. Lesions similar to those in the nasopharynx, but milder and less uniform, are found in the trachea. The rhinotracheitis of SDAV is usually self-limiting and it is resolved by the end of the second week of infection (6) . Although not as prevalent or as severe as upper respiratory tract lesions, microscopic changes do occur in the lower respiratory tract in experimental infections of rats (7), consisting of focal nonsuppurative bronchiolitis and peribronchial lymphocytic infiltration.",

In this study, a low number of male rats exposed to the two highest doses of the chemical had an increased incidence of sarcomas in the ventral neck region. The relevance and toxicological significance of these neoplasms was questionable because the species and sex specificity of the response was inconsistent with the body of knowledge on the toxicity of the chemical. It was postulated that the tumor response may have been due to a combination of viral infection and exposure to high concentrations of methylene chloride. This case exemplifies the problems that may occur in toxicologic studies when unusual and unexpected lesions are found in animals that had infectious processes within the target organ of toxicity.",

Inhalation of the important industrial compound hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) can cause a synergistic enhancement of the progression and severity of MRM (21, 22) . In HMPA toxicity studies, nasal tumors, rhinitis, nasal epithelial degeneration, metaplasia, and dysplasia were noted in cornunction with an enhanced mortality from chronic pneumonia in infected rats. The increased mortality was possibly due to a chemically induced destruction of the mucociliary apparatus in the upper airway, which may have contributed to fatal lower respiratory infections. A chronic inhalation bioassay of propylene oxide revealed dose-dependent nasal epithelial proliferative lesions and two nasal adenomas in rats with intercurrent MRM (23) . The significance of the proliferative nasal lesions, which appeared to be treatment related, was difficult to interpret, since their development may have been influenced by intercurrent infectious inflammatory disease.",
