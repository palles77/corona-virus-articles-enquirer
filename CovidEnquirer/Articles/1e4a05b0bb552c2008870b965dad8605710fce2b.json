            "text": "This study aimed to identify optimal high-temperature indices to predict risks of all-cause mortality and outpatient visits for subtropical islanders in warm seasons (May to October). Eight high-temperature indices, including three single measurements (average, maximum and minimum temperature) and five composite indices (heat index, humidex, temperature humidity index, apparent temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature), and their standardized Z scores, were used in distributed lag non-linear models. Cumulative 8-day (lag zero to seven days) relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated, 1 and 2 standardized deviations above the medium (i.e., at 84.1th and 97.7th percentile, respectively), by comparing with Z scores for the lowest risks of mortality and outpatient visits as references. Analyses were performed for Taipei in north, Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan. Results showed that standardized Z-values of hightemperature indices associated with the lowest health risk were approximately 0 in Taipei and Central Taiwan, and \u2212 1 in Southern Taiwan. As the apparent temperature was at Z = 2, the cumulative 8-day mortality risk increased significantly, by 23% in Taipei and 28% in Southern Taiwan, but not in Central Taiwan. The maximum temperature displayed consistently a high correlation with all-cause outpatient visits at Z = 1; with the cumulative 8-day RRs for outpatient visits increased by 7%, 3%, and 4% in the three corresponding areas. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated methods to compare multiple high-temperature indices associated with all-cause mortality and outpatient visits for population residing in a subtropical island. Apparent temperature is an optimal indicator for predicting all-cause mortality risk, and maximum temperature is recommended to associate with outpatient visits. The impact of heat varied with study areas, evaluated health outcomes, and high-temperature indices. The increased extreme heat is associated with stronger risk for all-cause mortality than for outpatient visits.",

Anderson et al. have indicated that, after adjusting for humidity, the temperature-mortality associations are not significantly different among using average, maximum and apparent temperature metrics (Anderson and Bell, 2009 ). Barnett et al. (2010) suggested that no temperature index can be considered optimal because all indices are highly correlated with temperature measurements. The applied temperature measurement should be chosen according to practical concerns, i.e. the measure may provide comprehensive information (Barnett et al., 2010) .

The humidex developed by Environment Canada was used as the measure of subjectively perceived temperature and humidity (Masterton and Richardson, 1979) . To assess the temperature perception in study population (Rosenberg et al., 1983) , we used the Taiwan CWB adopted THI index. It is similar to the thermal discomfort index developed by the U.S. Weather Bureau, widely used in Europe as well to assess heat discomfort (Pantavou et al., 2011) . The AT was used as an alternative measure of perceived temperature, which combines several environmental and physiological variables, including temperature, clothing cover, physical activity, WS and WVP (Steadman, 1984) .

Basically, the standardized score for the lowest health risk was inspected from each plot of standardized high-temperature index-health association. This method was similar to estimate relative risks of various temperature indices at the 95th, 96th, 97th, 98th, 99th, and 99.5th percentiles, which had been used previously in the Australian study (Vaneckova et al., 2011) . Data management and all statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Statistical Environment R 2.12. Table 2 depicts the descriptive statistics for climatic factors, hightemperature indices and air pollutants in the three study areas during May-October in 2000-2008. Both the highest and lowest average temperatures appeared in Taipei. Average RH ranged from 53% to 98%, and average WS ranged from 0.60 to 12.0 m/s in study areas. Air pollutant concentrations were similar among areas except that average PM 10 and O 3 concentrations were higher in Southern Taiwan. The correlation coefficients between each pairs of the eight hightemperature indices ranged from 0.61 to 0.99, the lowest correlation was between maximum and minimum temperature, and the higher correlations were among the composite high-temperature (r 2 = 0.89 to 0.99) (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the association between high-temperature indices (lag 0 day) and daily all-cause deaths measured using LOESS. The high-temperature indices varied among areas, with wider ranges for original high-temperature indices in Taipei. After standardization for these indices, the regression lines showed a similar pattern of association for Z scores ranged within \u00b12 standard deviation. A U-shaped temperature-mortality association was observed in Taipei. An observed positive linear relationship between mortality and high temperatures was identified in Southern Taiwan. No significant association with high temperature was detected in Central Taiwan. Fig. 3 shows the association between high-temperature indices and outpatient visits on lag 0 day measured using LOESS. There were larger variations at Z scores lower than \u22122 (i.e., extremely low percentiles in warm seasons).

Vaneckova et al. also found that average temperature and composite high-temperature indices perform similarly in estimating mortality risk (Vaneckova et al., 2011) . Likewise, all high-temperature indices are significantly associated with mortality in this study because temperature indices are highly correlated with each other. The cumulative mortality risks associated with the composite indices are also relatively similar. In subtropical regions, the consistent high temperature and humidity, and other weather characteristics such as WS and WVP result in a relatively smaller effect on perceived temperature. Barnett et al. (2010) have concluded that no high-temperature index can be considered superior to others, because an optimal high-temperature index is also associated with age groups, seasons, and areas analyzed.

The corresponding RRs of outpatient visits are more fluctuated and inconsistent . These findings support the study in England that high temperatures have a larger effect on mortality than on morbidity (Kovats et al., 2004) . We found the mortality risk increased dramatically as standardized high-temperature indices increased from Z = 1 to 2. Nonetheless, the standardized high-temperature indices have higher RRs at Z = 1 than at Z = 2 for all-cause outpatient visits. A possible explanation is that people who have mild illness may take immediate action in response to remit the symptoms. They may stay in air conditioned environment or drink more fluids against the outdoor high temperature.",

Therefore, the health risks associated with these high-temperature indices are evaluated only for the population residing in the area-specific environment. Studies with similar methodologies are thus suggested for populations located in different climates. In addition, this study also found that the risks associated with heat are significant in Taipei and Southern Taiwan rather than in Central Taiwan. Compared with the other two areas, Central Taiwan has lower income and higher portion of the elders (Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan), 2012). However, due to limited detail information for social economics, this study may not conclude any effects related with these factors. Interactions among these variables are recommended to assess in future study. Moreover, this ecological study focused only on all-cause mortality and outpatient visits. Further studies of temperature effects on human physical responses, clinical symptoms of heat exposure, and identification of the most vulnerable groups are needed to establish a comprehensive heat wave warning system in the future.",
