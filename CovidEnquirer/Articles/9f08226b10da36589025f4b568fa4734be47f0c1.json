Public health and research have placed major focus on understanding the pathogenicity of different infl uenza virus strains and characterizing new infl uenza vaccines. Nonhuman primates (NHPs), including macaques, have become popular experimental models for studying the pathogenesis and immunology of seasonal and emerging infl uenza viruses. NHPs readily seroconvert after experimental inoculation with seasonal infl uenza virus and have been used to test candidate vaccines for strains of human and avian origin. Like humans, macaques infected with infl uenza virus exhibit fever, malaise, nasal discharge, and nonproductive cough; virus replication can be detected in the nasal passages and respiratory tract (1, 2) . However, whether NHPs are infected with infl uenza viruses in nature remains unknown.",

Commonly trapped in the wild, these monkeys might be sold at wet markets, the putative source of several zoonotic outbreaks (3), where they might be caged next to any number of animal species (Figure 1 , panel A) (4). Pet and performing monkeys are likely conduits for cross-species transmission of respiratory pathogens like infl uenza viruses because of their close and long-term contact with their owners, audiences, domestic animals, wild animals, and birds ( Figure 1, panel B) (5) . However, the breadth and diversity of this interface presents a challenge for monitoring the emergence of infectious diseases. We have approached this challenge by conducting longitudinal studies at several sites and collecting biological samples and behavioral data representing various contexts of human-NHP contact (4-7). We used these historical and newly acquired samples, representing various countries and contexts of human-macaque contact, to determine whether NHPs are infected with infl uenza viruses in nature.",

ELISA results indicated nucleocapsid protein antibodies against infl uenza in samples from macaques from Cambodia (29.2%), Singapore (16.7%), Sulawesi (16.1%), Bangladesh (13.3%), and Java (6.0%) ( Table 1) . Antibodies were detected in animals 1-10 years of age at the time of sampling. No infl uenza virusspecifi c antibodies were detected from the 73 total samples from Gibraltar, perhaps because persons with infl uenza virus infection infrequently travel to the Upper Rock Reserve (healthy-visitor effect) (10) or perhaps because monkeys from Gibraltar are less susceptible to infection. Seroprevalence of antibodies against infl uenza A virus, by site and collection year, human and NHP population densities, and prevalence of avian infl uenza viruses are shown in Figure 2 .",

Although not all ELISA-positive serum samples could be subtyped, antibodies against seasonal subtype H1N1 and H3N2 infl uenza A strains were detected from macaques in Bangladesh, Singapore, Java, and Sulawesi (Table 2) . Of the performing macaques in Bangladesh, 2 had antibodies against A/chicken/Bangladesh/5473/2010, a strain of G1 clade subtype H9N2 avian infl uenza virus. Subtype H9N2 infl uenza viruses are prevalent in poultry in Bangladesh (14) and have been detected in humans (12) . We did not detect antibodies against highly pathogenic avian infl uenza subtype H5 viruses, which might not be surprising given our relatively small sample size (Table 2) .

            "text": "Our results indicate that NHPs that have contact with humans can be naturally infected with seasonal endemic human infl uenza viruses and with emerging pandemicrisk avian infl uenza viruses. We found serologic evidence of infection in several countries, contexts, and macaque species. Preliminary real-time reverse transcription PCR results also pointed to the presence of virus in a buccal swab from an adult macaque from Cambodia, indicating active infection at the time of sampling. On the basis of results from this study, it seems that pet, performing, and free-ranging macaques are susceptible to infl uenza virus infection. Given the close relationship between humans and NHPs in areas of the world where avian and human infl uenza viruses cocirculate, further surveillance of these populations is warranted. The ability to detect and eventually isolate strains of infl uenza virus currently infecting NHPs and humans at the animal-human interface is paramount to understanding how NHP-human interactions can affect the genetics, transmission, and public health risk for infection with infl uenza A viruses.",
