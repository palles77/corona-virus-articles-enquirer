            "text": "Infectious diseases remain one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Despite remarkable advances in vaccine development over the last century, the ease of world travel and increased global interdependence have added complexity to the fight against these diseases. With the aim of providing a forum to discuss the challenges facing vaccine development, Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology, in cooperation with the International Alliance for Biological Standardization, organize an annual conference ''New Technologies, New Vaccines\", dating back to 2006. This conference addresses new substrates and methodologies for the production and assessment of vaccines, and new approaches to overcome hurdles in vaccine research and development. The manuscripts collected in this special issue reflect advances in the field of vaccinology that were presented at the eleventh conference in this series, held at the Hotel du Pont Conference Center in Wilmington, Delaware from March 20th to 23rd, 2016. The conference attracted over 120 attendees working on various aspects of vaccine development and regulation, including representatives from governmental research laboratories, regulatory agencies, academia and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Topics addressed included emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, mosquito transmitted infectious diseases, antibody vaccines, systems biology approaches to vaccines, lead candidate identification, ex vivo systems for vaccine assessment, potency assays, novel vaccines and technologies, formulations and vaccine delivery, adjuvants, and regulatory issues.",

This assay, that does not require infectious virus, should expedite the assessment of vaccine candidates. Dauner and colleagues [8] of Sanofi Pasteur presented work on the application of the human cell-based MIMIC \u00d2 platform to assess age-related immunological responses to influenza vaccination. The use of modified DNA aptamers as an alternative to antibodies in vaccine potency assays is described in a manuscript by Trausch and colleagues [9] of Merck.
