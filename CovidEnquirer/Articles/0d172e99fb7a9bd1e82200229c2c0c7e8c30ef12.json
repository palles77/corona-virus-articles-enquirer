The emergence of a new infectious agent in the population, the new recognition of a previously undetected circulating agent, or the realization that a noncommunicable disease is actually caused by infection contribute to this group of microbial threats, unrelated to any possible intentional release of biologic agents or bioterrorism (1) . As with the scope of the larger body of all infections and infectious diseases, the capacity of emerging infections to affect the cardiovascular system varies from none to limited or increased risk. However, this task force report will focus on the possible cardiovascular implications of emerging infectious diseases and infection with select agents designated to have potential for intentional release.",

Gastrointestinal anthrax: Gastrointestinal anthrax is characterized by acute inflammation of the intestinal tract.

Salmonella endocarditis usually occurs in patients with pre-existing heart problems and often causes severe valvular destruction, with a case fatality rate of 70% (54) . About one-fourth of Salmonella endocarditic cases are nonvalvular (mural); and one-fourth of Salmonella endocarditic patients have associated lumbar osteomyelitis; however, their survival rates have not been reported (54) . Salmonella pericarditis often presents with cardiac or pulmonary symptoms, but typical signs of pericardial disease (pulsus paradoxus, friction rub) or characteristic electrocardiograph changes (low voltage, elevated ST-segments) are uncommon. Salmonella may also infect the peripheral or visceral arteries, but the abdominal aorta is the most frequent site of vascular infection (55) . Most of these patients are men over the age of 50 years with pre-existing atherosclerosis of the aorta who do not have a previous history of gastroenteritis and no survival with medical therapy alone has been reported. Salmonellae may also cause rare cases of myocarditis, but the pathogenesis is unclear (56, 57) .",

            "text": "Bioterrorist events can produce a variety of secondary cardiovascular effects. For example, mass vaccination campaigns to combat such potential bioterrorist agents as smallpox can lead to cardiovascular symptoms in some of those who receive the vaccine. The acute and posttraumatic psychological stress experienced by those affected (directly or indirectly) by the bioterrorist event may trigger acute cardiovascular events (such as heart attacks, sudden deaths, strokes) or exacerbate existing cardiovascular symptoms. In addition, a large-scale terrorist event could overwhelm the emergency medical and health care system, straining a community's ability to provide timely care for patients with the more conventional but time-dependent medical and surgical cardiovascular emergencies.In this report, we describe the secondary or indirect cardiovascular effects of the agents and diseases that are most likely to be used for bioterrorism. These include the impact of the stress produced by bioterrorism on cardiovascular health and the cardiovascular complications of smallpox vaccine. We then describe the pathophysiological processes through which bioterrorist attacks could trigger cardiovascular events, followed by suggestions for how to prevent or treat cardiovascular events during terrorist attacks and the implications for health care policy and future research. 1389 JACC Vol. 49, No. 12, 2007 Ornato et al.
