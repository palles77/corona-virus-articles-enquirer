An outbreak occurred in a small-scale dog kennel that contained 18 adult dogs in Suphanburi, central Thailand. Clinical signs in bitches and puppies were fever, acute watery diarrhea, and mild dehydration (Appendix Figure 1 , https:// wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/26/2/19-1151-App1. pdf). Information for the outbreak investigation indicated that 2 weeks earlier (July 18), 2 children (8 months and 2 years of age) who lived on the kennel premises were hospitalized because of vomiting and watery diarrhea. These children recovered within 1 week. During hospitalization, human cases were diagnosed and confirmed as norovirus infection by using a rapid test kit (RIDA QUICK Norovirus, https:// clinical.r-biopharm.com). Five adults, 2 children, and 18 adult dogs were living on the premises. All dogs were housed in the kennel; only 2 apparently pregnant dogs (CU21939 and CU21952) were moved into the house of the owner. The 2 apparently pregnant dogs were kept in close contact with children.",

We detected norovirus by using a reverse transcription PCR specific for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene as described (11, 12) (Appendix). We detected norovirus in samples from children (4/4), adult dogs (2/53), and puppies (10/18) (Appendix Table  1 ). All human samples were positive for norovirus at the first (July 27) and third (August 25) visits. The 2 bitches with clinical signs were positive for norovirus at the first visit (July 27). Their puppies (5/6) were positive at the second (August 18) and third (August 25) visits. Our findings are consistent with a previous report that animals can shed noroviruses for a long period (4) . All samples were also tested for canine parvovirus type 2, rotavirus A, canine coronavirus, and canine distemper virus to rule out other canine enteric diseases; all showed negative results (Appendix Table 1 ).",

Dogs showed mild clinical signs of acute watery diarrhea, similar to that for human norovirus infection, and low levels of illness and death. Similar observations have also been reported in other studies (8, 13) . In this study, children had been hospitalized 2 weeks before the investigation. Disease developed in dogs and puppies after they shared the same premises and possible direct contact with the children. This observation suggests potential human-to-dog transmission of human noroviruses. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that whole genomes of canine and human noroviruses were closely related to human norovirus GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney, suggesting that a common strain is circulating in Thailand and worldwide (14, 15) . However, in our study, it is not clear how and when the viruses were introduced to children and dogs. In summary, we demonstrated evidence of norovirus GII.Pe-GII.4 infection in humans and dogs in Thailand. Dog owners and veterinarians should pay more attention to norovirus infection as a potential zoonotic and reverse zoonotic disease in households, animal hospitals, and shelters. Expanded surveillance for norovirus is needed to determine its status and distribution in human and dog populations.",
