The detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and interference were evaluated as measures of analytical performance. For the comparison study, 100 HBV-positive blood samples and 100 HBV-negative samples from Korean Blood Bank Serum were used, and the results of the ExiStation HBV system showed good correlation with those obtained using the Cobas TaqMan (r 2 = 0.9931) and Abbott real-time PCR systems (r 2 = 0.9894). The lower limit of detection was measured as 9.55 IU/mL using WHO standards and the dynamic range was linear from 6.68 to 6.68 \u00d7 10 9 IU/mL using cloned plasmids. The within-run coefficient of variation (CV) was 9.4%, 2.1%, and 1.1%, and the total CV was 11.8%, 3.6%, and 1.7% at a concentration of 1.92 log 10 IU/mL, 3.88 log 10 IU/mL, and 6.84 log 10 IU/mL, respectively. No cross-reactivity or interference was detected. The ExiStation HBV diagnostic system showed satisfactory analytical sensitivity, excellent reproducibility, no cross-reactivity, no interference, and high agreement with the Cobas TaqMan and Abbott real-time PCR systems, and is therefore a useful tool for the detection and monitoring of HBV infection.",
