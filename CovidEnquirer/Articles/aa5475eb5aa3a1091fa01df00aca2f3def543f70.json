We aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of confinement to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Interpretation Our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epidemiologically. We especially need to support people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results also highlight that physically active people, as indicated by more hours of exercise, might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues due to the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.",

Yet, the implications of the unusually prolonged state of not working and exercising on individuals' health and wellbeing remain unknown. It is important to understand not only the implications of the restrictions on COVID-19 disease prevalence rates but also the implications of such unprecedented disruptions on the health and wellbeing of the community. 3 To control the COVID-19 outbreak, China has enacted restrictive measures \"unprecedented in public health history\" as stated by WHO. 5 On January 23, 2020, China locked down Wuhan, a metropolitan area of 12 million people. 6 The lockdown in Wuhan soon triggered similar measures in all 15 other cities in Hubei province with a total of 57 million people. Other prefectures (the administrative areas of a city) in China subsequently implemented varying levels of restrictive measures. For instance, the prefecture of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province restricted its citizens in such a way that only one person per household could leave home once every two days.",

An article in Lancet COVID-19 series specifically highlighted that people who had been in quarantine reported a high prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress and disorder and some of these symptoms seem to stay long after the quarantine. 2 Relatedly, another Lancet article argued we need to pay attention to the psychological issues of children who are not able to go to school. 9 This issue is important not only for children or suspected cases under quarantine but also for other people, as over one billion people in China who did not carry the virus epidemiologically but had their work and life disrupted to varying degrees.",

The number of cases per 10,000 people (i.e. infected rate) varied from 42\u00b745 (Wuhan) to 0\u00b701 on February 21. 16 Because COVID-19 is more dangerous for people with comorbidity, 17 it is likely that people who have ongoing medical issues would suffer more during the outbreak and therefore we asked whether the participants had any chronic disease. On the contrary, people who lead a healthy lifestyle and exercise often would be expected to fare better during the outbreak.

The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, and the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, people's lives have been severely disrupted. One third (33%) of the participants had not left their home at all during the previous one month due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. Of the sample, 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse health conditions by SF12 as well as distress (K6). The severity of COVID-19 in an individual's home city predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by individuals' existing chronic health issues and their hours of exercise.",
