In this study we evaluated the influence of commensal bacterial [two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. reuteri] colonization and rotavirus infection on distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and conventional DCs (cDCs) in ileum, spleen and blood. Gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with LAB and virulent Wa strain human rotavirus (HRV) (LAB+HRV+), HRV only (LAB\u00c0HRV+), LAB only (LAB+HRV\u00c0) or mock (LAB\u00c0HRV\u00c0). The cDCs were characterized as SWC3 + CD11R1 + , whereas monocytes/macrophages were identified as SWC3 + CD11R1 \u00c0 by flow cytometry in the gnotobiotic pigs at 10 days of age. Infection with HRV alone activated/recruited significantly more monocytes/macrophages to the intestine than LAB colonization and 56% versus 28% of these cells expressed CD14. Colonization with LAB alone also significantly increased the frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the CD14 expression on monocytes/macrophages in ileum and spleen compared to the controls. LAB colonization plus HRV infection significantly reduced macrophage and cDC frequencies in spleen compared to LAB colonization or HRV infection alone, suggesting that LAB colonization down-regulated HRV\u00c0 infection-induced monocyte/macrophage activation/recruitment at the systemic lymphoid tissue. These results illustrated the distribution of porcine monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the frequencies of CD14 expression on these cells in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues in the early stage of immune responses to intestinal colonization by LAB versus infection by an enteric pathogen HRV and will facilitate further in vivo studies on functional characterization of these immune cells in neonates. #",

They express class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) gene products, typically process and present antigen to T cells, and stimulate T cell activation. The principal function of DCs is activation of na\u00efve T cells and initiation of primary T cell responses (Cavanagh and Von Andrian, 2002) . DCs can also activate B cells directly. Immature DCs capture microbial antigens and migrate to secondary lymphoid tissues. During this process, DCs mature to become efficient at presenting antigens and stimulating na\u00efve T cells (Paillot et al., 2001; Randolph et al., 2005) . The DCs also influence the balance between Th1 and Th2 type immunity, as well as oral tolerance (Dudda et al., 2005; Kalinski et al., 1999; Kronin et al., 2000) .",

Intestinal macrophages in lamina propria are derived from blood monocytes and they play a unique role as effector cells of the innate immune system. In the normal intestine, resident lamina propria macrophages are non-inflammatory but retain avid scavenger and host defense functions . In rotavirus infections, macrophages may play a role in extraintestinal infection. Rotavirus proteins were detected in macrophages in both intestinal and extraintestinal lymphoid tissues (Brown and Offit, 1998) . Recent studies suggest that the rotavirus non-structural protein (NSP) 1 induces interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 7 degradation, which may allow rotavirus to move across the gut barrier by enabling the virus to replicate in specialized trafficking cells (DCs and macrophages) that constitutively express IRF7 (Barro and Patton, 2007) . Rotavirus replication was confirmed in DC and potentially in macrophages and B cells of mice (Fenaux et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "The objectives of this study were to elucidate the influence of rotavirus infection, commensal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) colonization, and the combined effect of rotavirus and LAB on the early postnatal ontogeny of innate immune responses in gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs by determining the distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and CD14 expression on these cells in the intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues. The neonatal Gn pig model represents a unique model to study the effects of colonization by commensals and infection by rotavirus on development of the innate immune system because gnotobiotic status of the animals avoids confounding factors from extraneous enteric bacteria and viruses. Gnotobiotic pigs are devoid of maternal antibodies thus Gn pigs represent an ''immunologically virgin '' model (Tlaskalova-Hogenova et al., 2004) . Gnotobiotic pig model of human rotavirus (HRV) infection and disease has been used extensively in studies of rotavirus pathogenesis, immunity and vaccines (Yuan and Saif, 2002) . However, induction and development of innate immune responses to HRV in pigs have not been elucidated. LAB is major components of the commensal microbial flora in the gut of humans and pigs and is commonly used as probiotics (Ahrne et al., 1998) . They have been shown to significantly stimulate gut epithelial cell proliferation (Ichikawa et al., 1999) and enhance non-specific and specific immunity in children or young lab animals (Fukushima et al., 1998; Herias et al., 1999; Yasui et al., 1999) . Several strains of LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. reuteri have been shown to reduce the risk, severity or duration of rotavirus diarrhea (Van Niel et al., 2002) ; however the mechanisms are undefined. Our hypothesis is that neonatal Gn pigs with or without LAB colonization and infected with HRV develop different monocyte/macrophage and cDC responses in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues. In addition, LAB colonization and/or HRV infection influences expression of CD14 on these cells differently.",

            "text": "In pigs, although monocytes/macrophages and DCs in various tissues have been studied, no single specific markers are known that allow definitive identification. The most frequently detected marker on porcine monocytes/macrophages and DCs is SWC3 (CD172a) (Bautista et al., 2002; Bimczok et al., 2006 Bimczok et al., , 2005 Carrasco et al., 2001; Chamorro et al., 2005; Domenech et al., 2003; Haverson et al., 1994 Haverson et al., , 2000 Jamin et al., 2006; McCullough et al., 1997; Rehakova et al., 1998; Salmon et al., 2000; Summerfield et al., 2003) . It is a member of the signal regulatory protein family and associates with protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (Alvarez et al., 2000) . In addition to SWC3, CD11b (CD11R1) is a marker specifically and differentially expressed on porcine DCs, but not on monocytes/macrophages (Bimczok et al., 2006 (Bimczok et al., , 2005 Haverson et al., 2000; Jamin et al., 2006) . Several subsets of DCs have been reported in pigs (Bimczok et al., 2005; Jamin et al., 2006) . In pig intestinal lymphoid tissues, four subsets were identified as SWC3 + CD11b + , SWC3 \u00c0 CD11b + , SWC3 + CD11b \u00c0 , and SWC3 \u00c0 CD11b \u00c0 , but all DCs emigrating from the intestine via lymphatic vessels in pigs are CD11b positive (SWC3 + CD11b + and SWC3 \u00c0 CD11b + ) (Bimczok et al., 2005) . Two major subsets of DCs, cDCs (SWC3 + CD4 \u00c0 ) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (SWC3 + CD4 + ) were identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) of pigs (Summerfield et al., 2003) . Jamin et al studied the phenotypic characteristics of cDCs and pDCs in tonsil, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and blood MNC of pigs and identified cDCs as SWC3 + CD11R1 + and pDCs as SWC3 + CD4 + (Jamin et al., 2006) . In a resent study, the pDCs are more clearly defined as SWC3 low CD4 + (Gonzales et al., 2007) . Besides monocytes/macrophages and DCs, the pan-myeloid marker SWC3 is also expressed on granulocytes. However, selective gating on forward scatter/side scatter (FSC/SSC) can separate most SWC3 + granulocytes from monocytes/macrophages . In this study, we used SWC3 and CD11R1 to define cDCs as SWC3 + CD11R1 + and monocytes/macrophages as SWC3 + CD11R1 \u00c0 .",

            "text": "The CD14 is a specific receptor that is expressed on subsets of monocytes and macrophages and to a lesser extent on neutrophils (Antal-Szalmas et al., 1997) . The CD14 is also expressed on monocytes-derived DCs (Carrasco et al., 2001) . Study of differentiation of porcine myeloid bone marrow haematopoietic cell populations suggests that CD14 is a maturation-dependent antigen and study of CD14 expression may be useful for assessment of cell maturity . It has been shown that CD14 plays an essential role in uptake of substrates by cells and interacts with ligands, including bacterial (i.e. LPS, peptidoglycan and phosphatidylinositol) and non-bacterial products (i.e. PolyI:C) to enhance ligand-mediated cell activation (Dunzendorfer et al., 2004; Dziarski et al., 2000; Wang and Munford, 1999) . Porcine respiratory coronavirus infection induced marked increase of CD14 + monocytes/ macrophages in the lung tissues of Gn pigs (Van Gucht et al., 2006 . Recent findings showed that CD14 directly interacts with intracellular TLR3 and enhances dsRNA-mediated TLR3 activation by aiding uptake of dsRNA into cells. The CD14 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited impaired responses to PolyI:C and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines (Lee et al., 2006) . These suggest that CD14 may play a role in initiation of innate immune responses to dsRNA, such as PolyI:C and dsRNAviruses, including rotavirus. Increased CD14 expression may indicate maturation and/or increased activity (e.g. TLR activation and antigen presentation) of innate immune cells. Thus we choose to study CD14 expression as a functional marker of innate immunity. Little is known about the expression of CD14 on DCs and monocytes/ macrophages in neonatal pigs after rotavirus infection and how commensal/probiotic bacterial colonization influences the expression pattern of CD14.",

The SWC3/CD11R1 dot plot was performed within R1 area to define SWC3 + CD11R1 + cDCs within R2 [(cell count in R2/cell count in R1) \u00c2 100% = frequencies of cDCs] and SWC3 + CD11R1 \u00c0 monocytes/macrophages within R3 (R3/R1 \u00c2 100% = frequencies of monocytes/macrophages) (Fig. 1B) . For analysis of expression of CD14 among SWC3 + cells, SWC3/SSC dot plot was performed (within R1) to define SWC3 + cells within R4 area (Fig. 1C) . Frequencies of SWC3 + CD14 + CD11R1 \u00c0 and SWC3 + CD14 + CD11R1 + subsets were the percentages of cell counts in the quadrants (CD14 + CD11R1 \u00c0 or CD14 + CD11R1 + ) over total counts of SWC3 + cells (R4) (Fig. 1D) . Besides monocytes/macrophages and cDCs, the pan-myeloid marker SWC3 is also expressed on granulocytes. However, gating on R1 (Fig. 1 ) avoided the detection of most SWC3 + granulocytes. Therefore, the MNC stained as SWC3 + CD11R1 \u00c0 are mainly monocytes/macrophages and SWC3 + CD11R1 + are mainly cDCs.

The mechanism for the decreased monocyte/macrophage frequencies of the LAB+HRV+ group is undefined. Considering also the significantly decreased frequencies of CD14 + monocytes/macrophages in ileum of these pigs, it is attempting to postulate that LAB down-regulated the recruitment of HRV\u00c0 activated monocytes/macrophages to the systemic site (spleen) and the recruitment/maturation of these cells in ileum thereby limiting the inflammation induced by HRV infection. However this hypothesis will need to be tested in future studies. It was reported that monocyte-derived macrophages did not express CD14 in the normal mucosa of human intestines (Smith et al., 1997 (Smith et al., , 2001 Smythies et al., 2005) . In our study we observed the lowest frequencies of ileal CD14 + monocytes/macrophages in the control group and lower frequencies in the pigs colonized with LAB. Several other studies have shown that a high proportion of the macrophages in the inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease expressed CD14 . Thus CD14 expression by intestinal monocytes/macrophages is associated with inflammatory responses in the gut and the LAB (mixed L. acidophilus and L. reuteri) exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the CD14 + monocyte/ macrophage frequencies in pigs.",

The HRV infection alone induced the highest frequencies of CD14 + monocytes/ macrophages in the ileum (56%) and the lowest in the blood (29%). Significantly reduced frequencies of CD14 + monocytes/macrophages in blood of the LAB\u00c0HRV+ pigs coincided with the significantly increased frequencies of CD14 + monocytes/macrophages in ileum and spleen of these pigs compared to the controls. The similarity between the pattern of monocyte/macrophage frequencies and the pattern of CD14 expression on these cells in ileum and blood of the four treatment groups suggests that CD14 expression is closely related to the activation/maturation of monocytes/macrophages at these sites. In naive germfree pigs (LAB\u00c0HRV\u00c0), the frequencies of CD14 + monocytes/macrophages in ileum and spleen were significantly lower than the other three groups. However, the majority (59.38%) of blood monocytes expressed CD14 in the na\u00efve pigs. Unlike HRV infection, the frequencies of CD14 + monocytes in blood were not significantly influenced by LAB colonization.",

In addition, frequencies of cDCs and CD14 + cDCs in ileum and blood of the LAB\u00c0HRV+ pigs did not differ from the germ-free pigs (LAB\u00c0HRV\u00c0). An explanation for this observation is that ileal and blood cDCs are not strongly involved in immune responses to rotavirus infection. This explanation concurs with the findings from an in vitro study on the interaction of rotavirus and monocytederived blood DCs (Narvaez et al., 2005) . It was shown that rotavirus had limited effect on activation/maturation of the DCs. The rotavirus did not induce cell death of immature or mature DCs or inhibit the maturation of DCs, but also did not strongly stimulate maturation of DCs.",

Thus, LAB colonization and HRV infection significantly reduced the total frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cDCs in spleen of Gn pigs; but among those cells, a higher percent of them expressed CD14 compared to LAB only pigs. Therefore, there was an antagonistic effect between LAB colonization and HRV infection on the frequencies of monocytes/ macrophages and cDCs and a synergistic effect on CD14 expression on these cells in the systemic lymphoid tissue. The mechanism and implication of the antagonistic/synergistic effects require further study.",

The different experimental condition, in vivo versus in vitro, and different DC subset may partially explain the discrepancies among these studies.

Thus LAB colonization alone had a significant impact on early postnatal development of innate immune system in both the intestinal and systemic sites. The impact of HRV infection alone was similar to that of LAB colonization alone (except for cDC frequencies in ileum) but at a greater magnitude. Therefore either intestinal commensal bacterial colonization or pathogenic enteric viral infection effectively promoted the development of innate immune system in neonatal pigs. In conclusion, this study illustrated the distribution and frequencies of porcine monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and CD14 expression on these cells in the early stage of immune responses to intestinal colonization by LAB versus infection by an enteric pathogenic virus on an ''immunologically virgin'' background. These results will facilitate further in vivo studies on functional characterization of these immune cells in neonatal pigs.",
