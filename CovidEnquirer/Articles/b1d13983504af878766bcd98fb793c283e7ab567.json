However, EChT is not established and mechanisms are not completely understood. In vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the toxic changes and effectiveness of EChT on an animal tumour model. Methods: Tumours were induced by injecting cells from the R3230AC rat mammary tumour cell line clone D subcutaneously, in 28 female Fischer 344 rats. EChT was conducted by inserting a platinum electrode into the tumours. The positive and negative control groups were subjected to the same conditions but without current. The rats were kept for 0, 7 or 14 days post-treatment. Three hours prior to euthanasia an i.p. injection of Bromodioxyuridine (BrdU) was given. The rats were euthanized, the lesions extirpated and samples were collected for histopathological, and immunohistochemical examination. Results: Significant changes in cell proliferation rate were seen both in the cathode and anode regions. Apoptosis were induced in the anodic treated area outside the primary necrosis, detected with the TUNEL method. Discussion: The results suggest that secondary cell destruction was caused by necrosis with cathodic EChT and apoptosis or necrosis with anodic EChT. D",

            "text": "Electrolysis is a simple technique using a direct current passed through a conductive medium between a pair of electrodes, measured in Coulombs (1 C = 1 A \u00c2 1 s). At the cathode (negative electrode) sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas are liberated, whereas at the anode (positive electrode), hydrochloric acid, oxygen, and chlorine gas are produced [8, 9] . The resulting pH change, the anode becomes acidic relative to the basic environment surrounding the cathode, causes a localised parenchymal necrosis [10, 11] . The electric field causes a flux of interstitial water, electro-osmosis, from the anode towards the cathode, since the water molecules act like a dipole. Consequently, the tissue surrounding the anode dehydrates while oedema is obtained around the cathode [9, 12] . Charged substances, dissolved or suspended in tissue, migrate in the electric field and accumulation of ions and charged tissue constituents are obtained at certain and different locations in the electric field. The electric field influences the ion exchange across the cell membranes. Hence, the transmembrane potential is altered and thereby the conditions, e.g. for many essential enzyme-regulated reactions [9, 13] . There is a negligible thermal effect [14] .",

In 1983 Professor Nordenstr\u00f6m reported results from the treatment of 26 lung tumours in 20 patients [9] . Many of these patients were, for various reasons, unsuitable for surgical, radiotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic treatment. Regression was obtained in 12 out of 26 tumours and no signs of re-growth were detected after a 2 -5 year follow-up period. Among the side effects, Nordenstr\u00f6m noticed slight fevers and local pain during the treatment. From the early 1990s until today more than 15 000 patients have been treated with EChT in China [15] . The results have been presented in a number of publications and at several conferences and have been thoroughly reviewed, for example by Nilsson et al. [16] . Despite the vast experiences from China and recent clinical experimental studies in Australia [17] EChT is still not established and obviously endorse the need for further investigation concerning e.g. destructive mechanisms.",

As we believe that the pH alterations during EChT is the major reason for tissue destruction we have recently presented a paper where the R3230AC Rat mammary tumour clone D was investigated in vitro [19] . In this study tumour cells were exposed to a pH gradient similar to that of EChT and after a variable period of recovering in normal medium investigations were carried out concerning viability (MTTtest), morphological observation in phase contrast microscope and light microscope, nucleotide analogue incorporation (BrdU), caspase-3 activity measurement and detection of DNA fragmentation by an agarose gel electrophoresis. In this study cell proliferation was significantly impaired, both in acidic and alkaline milieu. More interesting however was the fact that apoptosis was induced only in strong acidic environment and that the cell morphology distinctly resembles the features seen in in vivo experiments with EChT.",

Interestingly the cell proliferation rate was reduced significantly in the whole tumour, both for the anodic and cathodic treatment, suggesting that secondary mechanisms such as the inflammatory response, tumour ischemic anoxia and radical formations also impair the tumour progression after EChT. Hence, the treatment had a significant effect on tumour cells proliferation far from the evidently destroyed area.",

Low pH e results in low pH i because of increased H + entry. Intracellular acidification correlates well with DNA digestion, and acidic cells show apoptotic morphology [26] . It has also been shown that acid endonuclease can be responsible for the DNA cleavage seen in apoptotic neutrophils [27] .

It is also described that EChT causes micro thrombi that eventually lead to ischemic injury [9, 17] . It is however not clear if there is any difference between electrode polarities, considering micro thrombi formation and hypoxic lesions, although some reports claim a slightly stronger impact at the anode [31, 32] . Apoptosis is triggered by a hypoxic environment [33, 34] . Thus, it is easy to assume that the apoptosis found in this study is due to ischemic injury. However, it is hard to explain why there is such a difference between the anodic and cathodic treatments. Furthermore, the results in the previous described in vitro study support the hypothesis that low pH induces apoptosis, whereas high pH induce necrosis [19] . Taking these two studies together they indicate that the EChT of R3220AC cells and exposition of low pH in vitro exhibit several features of apoptosis including chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, TUNEL labelling and activation of caspases.",
