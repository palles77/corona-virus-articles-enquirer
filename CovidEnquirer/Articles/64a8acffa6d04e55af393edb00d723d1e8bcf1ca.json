            "text": "Domestic rabbits are descended from the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus. The ancestral form probably evolved in the Iberian Peninsula and spread to other parts of the Mediterranean (Fox, 1974) . Fossil records show that the European rabbit was confined to the Iberian peninsula and southern France following the Pleistocene era. While rabbits have been associated with man since Roman times, they have only been truly domesticated for around 200 years. The geographical range of the rabbit has been altered significantly by man, who from Roman times onwards placed rabbits on islands on various shipping routes, to allow them to breed and form a ready source of food. Thus their European range significantly altered, and rabbits proved very successful where the climate and geographical conditions were suitable. More recently rabbits were introduced in Victoria, Australia, where their success, due to rapid breeding and a lack of suitable predators, rapidly became a plague that cost the Australian Government millions of dollars and led to the implementation of myxomatosis virus for biological control. Although European rabbits have been released in North America, the presence of suitable predators, an unsuitable climate and other species filling their ecological niche proved insurmountable. In North America the native wild rabbit is either Sylvilagus floridanus (cottontail) or Sylvilagus bachmani (brush rabbit). The North American jackrabbit, Lepus californicus, is from the hare genus.",

The main surface entrances are usually indicated by mounds of earth but there are numerous other small openings that lack these mounds.

Male rabbits within the group will establish a dominance hierarchy, with the older heavier males at the top. Aged males that have been usurped by younger, fitter rabbits are driven from the group to become solitary satellite males (Lockley, 1978) . Young male rabbits are also often driven from the group when they reach puberty either to join another warren or to lead solitary lives in the hedgerows. The females tend to remain within the original group. Female rabbits are less aggressive towards each other than males, but will defend a chosen nesting site ferociously. Territories are scent marked with pheromones from the scent glands on the chin and genital area or by urine marking. Dominant males will continually scent mark their territory by rubbing their chins on branches and bushes and leaving piles of strategically placed faeces. They also mark territory by spraying urine, sometimes on to other individuals.",

Initially, they graze grass and vegetation, raising their heads at intervals to survey the surroundings, perhaps chewing through a long stalk or blade of grass at the same time. After half an hour or so, they will start to look around for other palatable plants to nibble. They are constantly on the lookout for danger and will readily bolt back to their burrow. Hard faecal pellets are always voided above ground, never in the burrow and soft caecotrophs are usually consumed during periods of rest underground, although occasionally rabbits exhibit this behaviour above ground (Lockley, 1978) . The only vocal sounds that are made are a loud high-pitched scream of terror or a range of growls and hums that denote pleasure or defence. Apprehensive or frightened rabbits will thump the ground with their hind feet. The loud thumping sounds acts as an alarm signal to other rabbits in the vicinity.",

Domestication has resulted in rabbits that are far tamer than their wild counterparts and easy to handle.

Conversely, wild rabbits seldom become tame in captivity, although the occasional individual will overcome its fear of humans. Handreared orphans usually grow into fearful adults. Even rabbits that are born as a result of egg transfer from a wild rabbit to a domesticated tame host retain their shy nature (Adams, 1987) .",

The fur breeds include rex, Angoras and satin rabbits with their beautiful coat textures. Fancy breeds include the Belgian hare, and lop and dwarf rabbits with their varying physical characteristics. Most pet rabbits belong to the smaller breeds such as dwarf lops, Dutch or English. Pedigree rabbit breeders often sell surplus stock to the pet trade and occasionally one of the more obscure breeds may turn up as a pet. Pedigree stock is identified by aluminium rings slipped over the hock when the rabbit is 8-10 weeks old. The rings are supplied by the British Rabbit Council in a range of sizes. Each ring has the year of birth and a unique number from which the rabbit can be identified. Many pet rabbits are the result of interbreeding between pets and are cross-breeds. As with other domestic animals, there are breed predispositions to disease. For example, dwarf rabbits are Textbook of Rabbit Medicine prone to congenital incisor malocclusion (Fox and Crary, 1971) . Dutch, Havana and tan rabbits have a high incidence of uterine neoplasia (Greene, 1941) .",

After defleecing, woollen jackets can be worn for 2-3 weeks to reduce heat loss or a strip of fleece can be left along the back (Lebas et al., 1998) . Commercial Angoras are not provided with bedding but are kept on wire mesh floors and hay is provided in a rack. The long fine coat is a definite disadvantage for the pet animal as it difficult to keep the rabbit free from knots and mats. It is not surprising that a high number of Angoras arrive at rescue shelters for rehoming. The breed is prone to intestinal obstruction by felts of ingested hair.",

In the late afternoon wild rabbits emerge from their burrows to feed, explore, socialize and mate. Grazing resumes during the early morning before the rabbit returns to the warren. Hard faecal pellets are voided during these periods above ground. During the day, caecotrophy (see Section 1.3.1) takes place while the rabbit is resting in the burrow, typically between 08.00 and 17.00 h. Female rabbits give birth in the morning and feed their young at night (McBride, 1988) . Domesticated rabbits also follow a natural daily rhythm. Laboratory rabbits that are fed ad lib consume little food between 06.00 h and midday and increase their intake between 17.00 h and midnight, eating most food during the night. Caecotrophs are expelled during periods of minimal feed intake in the morning and sometimes during the evening. If food is restricted, caecotrophs are excreted approximately 5 h after a meal. If a collar is fitted to prevent the ingestion of caecotrophs, feeding still ceases during caecotroph excretion, suggesting that cessation of food intake is not associated with gastric filling (H\u00f6 rnicke et al., 1984) .",

Ingestion of food is associated with increased caecal motility and the excretion of hard faeces. Caecotrophy is associated with a decline in caecal contractions, so caecal contractions are at a maximum when the animal is feeding. If food is withheld completely, the circadian rhythm of caecal contractions is maintained, but at a lower frequency that does not correlate with soft or hard faeces production (H\u00f6rnicke et al., 1984) . Absorption of volatile fatty acids and their metabolism in the liver shows a circadian rhythm parallel to the activity of the adrenal gland. Volatile fatty acid absorption into the portal circulation is greatest during the hard faeces phase of digestion, although arterial levels remain remarkably constant (Vernay, 1987) . Bile acid production shows a circadian rhythm (Fekete, 1989) . There is a diurnal variation in haematological values (Fox and Laird, 1970) , with lowest total white blood cell and lymphocyte counts occurring in the late afternoon and evening in association with increased neutrophil counts. Eosinophil counts peak during the afternoon, with the lowest values occurring in the morning. Blood urea nitrogen shows a diurnal variation that is linked with feeding patterns.

            "text": "In recent years, conditions have improved for many laboratory rabbits. They can be kept in social groups of four to eight animals with no detriment to their health (Turner et al., 1997) . It has been proven that rabbits prefer to be in proximity with each other as they are a social species with a defined hierarchy. They also 'interact with enrichment objects' such as wooden sticks, parrot toys or balls designed for cats (Huls et al., 1991) . Keeping rabbits in this way not only benefits the rabbits but also the people looking after them. Love (1994) described the response of animal technicians to group housing by saying they 'found it more agreeable to work with rabbits that came to the front of the cage when they heard the sounds of people, rather than cowering away' and 'it was a pleasure to see the rabbits interact with each other'. Stauffacher (1992) describes in detail many ways in which housing for rabbits can be constructed to permit natural behaviour patterns. Despite these advances, most breeding and exhibition rabbits still live their entire life confined to small cages. Some breeders still insist that rabbits should be kept singly in small cages and that large hutches and runs lead to aggression and behaviour problems (Sandford, 1996) . At last, the pet-owning fraternity is becoming aware of the rabbit's social nature and need for exercise. There has been a steady increase in the number of house rabbits and the status of the rabbit has shifted from the child's pet to a member of the family. A rabbit can be a satisfactory companion for adults that are out at work all day and find the needs of a dog or cat too demanding. Hopefully the days of keeping pet rabbits in solitary confinement in a barren hutch at the bottom of the garden are now coming to an end. There is legislation governing the welfare of rabbits that is summarized in Box 1.1.",

This space should be available in both the dark, covered portion of the hutch and the open living space. This space Textbook of Rabbit Medicine requirement should not include the outdoor run. The RSPCA spatial requirements are somewhat greater, the minimum being 1 m (3 ft) wide \u00c2 2 m (6 ft) long \u00c2 1 m (3 ft) high for both the enclosed and open portions of the living area. In any case where two adult rabbits live together, the space must be increased proportionally and suitable hide areas provided so that each rabbit can get away from the other if they want. The optimum temperature range for rabbits is 15-20 C, which can be checked with a maximum and minimum thermometer. Above this temperature rabbits can suffer from heat stress. Poor ventilation and ammonia build-up predispose to conjunctivitis and respiratory tract infections. It is preferable to situate the hutch against a sheltered wall outside, rather than in an enclosed garage with potential exposure to toxic car fumes. Placing the hutch in a large airy shed can be a good option as shelter is provided with the option of protected exercise space. Many rabbit owners are now using a whole garden shed as a kind of 'super-hutch' for housing two or more rabbits, providing ample indoor space. These sheds are then often attached to large aviary type runs to allow outside access (See Figure 1.1) . Rabbits are tolerant of cold conditions and can withstand winter weather provided they have shelter and plenty of bedding material. Thin rabbits with no body fat are more susceptible to the effects of cold and need extra Box 1.1 Legislation governing the welfare of rabbits There is legislation governing the welfare of farmed rabbits in the UK.

These conditions are potentially fatal as rabbits cannot sweat or pant effectively, and are far more damaging than cold conditions. The ability to get out of direct sunlight is of paramount importance, and needs to be considered when providing rabbit accommodation. Rabbits are far more capable of coping with cold and even wet conditions, as long as they have the opportunity to shelter and access to enough food and bedding. When planning rabbit accommodation, allowing the rabbit a choice of positions and therefore ambient temperatures, access to sunlight and shelter is a major benefit. Rabbits produce copious quantities of urine and faeces, which are usually deposited in one part of the hutch that should be cleaned once or twice daily. Bedding that is not fouled and remains clean and dry can be left in the hutch; however, with any deep litter system, a full clean should be done at least weekly, or more often if the bedding is wet or smells. Many types of material can be used as bedding. Any bedding material should be non-toxic, free from dust, comfortable to lie on and good insulation. Garden peat has been recommended to neutralize ammonia and reduce irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract (Malley, 1995) . An economical bedding material is a layer of newspaper covered in hay. This can be rolled up for disposal. The hay provides ad lib high fibre food in addition to a soft bed that is kind to the hocks. Other options include straw of various types. The advantage to straw is that it is cheap, easily available and very good at allowing fluid to drain away from the surface of the bedding, reducing potential contact with rabbit skin. Straw can be fairly sharp, depending on what type of crop it is made from, and can in some circumstances cause skin and ocular irritation. Rabbits will sometimes eat straw, which can cause oral trauma if it is sharp. Oat straw is an ideal option as it is soft as well as encouraging fluid drainage. Commercial forms of bedding are also available. These are often recycled paper products, and are well accepted by rabbits, although they are not the most economical bedding. Woodshavings and chips are not recommended because of the potential for dust to cause ocular and respiratory irritation and the possibility of sharp edges causing skin/mouth/eye wounds. Wood products containing aromatic oils may cause respiratory irritation and have been reported to cause hepatotoxicity.",

The opportunity to explore is mentally beneficial. All methods of providing exercise should be escape proof, although escapees instinctively remain close to their home territory and can usually be found providing they have not been carried off by a predator or are in search of a receptive mate. Any outside exercise area should be as large as possible and allow the rabbit sufficient space to run rather than just hop. Grass and natural vegetation is the ideal diet for rabbits. Access to a garden, enclosure or pen outside provides nutrition as well as environmental enrichment. Natural daylight is the best way of providing the correct amount of vitamin D for the animal's needs. Rabbits enjoy basking in the sun. However, their destructive and burrowing instincts, along with a taste for bedding plants, means free access to the garden should be supervised. Free rabbits are also prey to neighbours' Textbook of Rabbit Medicine dogs, cats and other animals such as foxes, so supervision or a well-fenced area or mesh pen is required. Ideally this should be a permanent structure that allows the rabbit to establish a familiar territory and feel secure. An area of approximately 3 m 2 (10 sq. ft) is sufficient, although larger areas are preferable. Branches, drainpipes, boxes and other enrichment objects can be placed in the enclosure to provide cover and recreation. Planting of suitable weeds/plants inside the enclosure is also a good idea.",

Alternatively, portable wire mesh runs can be used, the familiar territory being sacrificed for the ability to provide a fresh area of forage regularly. There are many designs, some of which can be moved around the lawn, allowing the rabbits to keep the grass down. Enclosed yards are an acceptable alternative to a garden.

Pregnant or pseudopregnant does exhibit marked burrowing behaviour, although it can still be exhibited by spayed females.

They spend time grooming each other and there are many benefits to mutual grooming, such as reducing parasite numbers in the fur and cleaning inaccessible places such as the face or back of the neck. Occasionally, a dominant rabbit will barber the fur of its companion. Neutering rabbits that are kept together is necessary to prevent fighting and unwanted pregnancies. Guinea pigs are sometimes kept as companions for rabbits, although this arrangement is not as satisfactory as two rabbits together. There is a small risk of the guinea pig contracting Bordetella bronchiseptica, which is asymptomatic in rabbits but can cause pneumonia in guinea pigs. Neutering is required to prevent bullying and constant sexual harassment of the guinea pig. Regardless, some rabbits will still bully their guinea pig companion, and hide boxes small enough to allow the pig in but exclude the rabbit should be provided. If the bullying is severe the welfare of the guinea pig is better served by breaking up the pair.

It is not possible to predict accurately whether newly introduced rabbits will form an instant rapport or attack each other. Neutered rabbits of the opposite sex are most likely to bond, although it is possible to keep same sex pairs together. Pairs of male rabbits need to be castrated to prevent fighting. Ideally, rabbits should be introduced on neutral territory with plenty of room for escape and hiding places to retreat into. If this is not possible, introducing the female to the male on his territory is more likely to be successful than the reverse. When they are first introduced, most rabbits spend a period chasing each other around and pulling some hair out, but will settle down eventually. A rabbit that has spent its entire life confined to a hutch may not realize that it can run around and is daunted by both the great outdoors and its new companion. It is not unusual for such rabbits to remain quiet and immobile for several days before they gain confidence and start to explore. If possible, a period of separated proximity is advisable to allow rabbits to become accustomed to each other's presence before they are introduced. Adjacent pens separated by wire mesh allow rabbits to sniff each other; also change around the bedding to get the rabbits used to the scent of the proposed companion in their own territory. It is a promising sign when the two are found lying side by side on either side of the mesh. Some rabbits never bond; others accept any new companion readily.",

As a result, many rabbits do not come out of their hutch for 6 months of the year because owners fear their pet will 'catch a chill'. It is important to provide exercise during the winter as well as the summer. Free-range rabbits that are kept outside all year round often choose to sit in the rain and snow despite having a hutch full of warm bedding to go into if required. They seem impervious to cold and as long as they have access to shelter, plenty of food and protection from predators, rabbits can be kept outside during the winter. Thin or ill rabbits or those that have not been acclimatized should not be kept in this fashion and need to be given extra protection indoors or in a hutch or shed during inclement weather. They can be allowed outside if the weather is good. If rabbits are not exposed to natural daylight during the winter months, vitamin D deficiency can occur. Undetectable vitamin D levels have been found in blood samples taken in spring from pet rabbits housed in hutches over winter (see Figure 1 .5) (Fairham and Harcourt-Brown, 1999 ). Stauffacher (1992) described the behaviour of rabbits under 'near-to-nature' or free-range conditions. The rabbits were kept in an open-air turfed enclosure with several trees and bushes. They were kept in groups of up to 30 animals and their daily activities followed a double diurnal rhythm with periods of rest alternating with periods of activity around dusk and dawn. During periods of rest, the rabbits sought out places with a good overview of the enclosure under bushes or near trees where they would huddle together and engage in mutual grooming. This method of husbandry permits natural behaviour patterns, encourages grazing and normal caecotrophy and allows animals to groom themselves and each other thoroughly, thereby removing skin debris, dead hair and parasites from the coat. In a study by Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001) blood samples from rabbits kept under freerange conditions had higher red cell and lymphocyte counts than rabbits kept in hutches, suggesting that they were healthier (see Figure 2 .1).",

The main thermoregulatory mechanism is by heat exchange in the ears, which have a large arteriovenous anastomotic system. In the nose, the nasal glands moisten inspired air, which also has a role in thermoregulation. Rabbits are unable to tolerate high ambient temperatures, which can prove fatal. The alimentary tract of the rabbit is adapted for the digestion of large quantities of fibrous food (Figure 1.3) . Rabbits have developed a strategy of high feed intake and rapid food transit through the gut to meet their nutritional needs from a nutrient dilute diet. Rabbits are hindgut fermenters and rely on microbial fermentation of food within the caecum to provide nutrients. In the stomach and small intestine, digestion and absorption of nutrients is similar to monogastric mammals. The end-products of the digestive processes are separated in the colon into indigestible material and substances that can be metabolized by caecal micro-organisms. Separation of the ingesta depends on particle size. The proximal colon of the rabbit is specially adapted for the separation of large particles of indigestible fibre from smaller particles that can be degraded and used as a substrate for bacterial fermentation in the caecum. The two components are simultaneously sent in opposite directions. Indigestible fibre passes down the colon to be rapidly eliminated as hard, dry faecal pellets. Smaller particles and fluids pass into the caecum where bacterial fermentation releases volatile fatty acids and synthesizes proteins and vitamins. Pellets of soft caecal contents (caecotrophs) are periodically expelled from the anus and re-ingested as a source of nutrients. This digestive strategy utilizes bacterial fermentation to synthesize nutrients and avoids the need to store large volumes of food in the digestive tract. Vegetation can be efficiently digested below ground without the need to spend long periods grazing and exposed to predators.",

Faeces are defined as 'body waste discharged from the intestine' and so, strictly speaking, faecal material is not the substance that is ingested by rabbits as it is not waste material but nutritionally rich caecal contents. The terms soft faeces and night faeces are sometimes used to describe the capsules of caecal material known as caecotrophs. The term night faeces is misleading. Caecotrophs are produced during the day in wild rabbits. They are produced 4 to 8 h after feeding during a quiet undisturbed period, which is during the day for a wild rabbit in its burrow but can be during the night or early morning for a domestic or laboratory rabbit in its cage or hutch.",

It has a well-developed cardiac sphincter that prevents vomiting, and a muscular pyloric area, although in general the muscular layer of the stomach is weaker than in other species. There is always food material in the stomach. Together, the caecum and the stomach contain over 80% of the digesta (Lang, 1981a) and the amount of material in them is dependent on age, breed, diet and time of day. Water and large quantities of acid are secreted into the stomach. The postprandial pH can fall to 1-2, which effectively sterilizes ingesta before it passes into the small intestine. The stomach pH of suckling rabbits is higher at approximately 5-6.5, which permits the passage of bacteria through the stomach to the hindgut to colonize the caecum. During the digestion of caecotrophs the stomach pH rises to 3.0 . Transit time of food through the stomach is approximately 3-6 h (Caraba\u00f1 o and Piquer, 1998). The alimentary tract of the rabbit is adapted for the digestion of large quantities of fibrous food. The teeth continually grow and wear against each other to maintain their shape. The incisors are worn to a fine cutting edge that can be used to slice through vegetation or gnaw hard substances such as bark or wood. The occlusal surfaces of the cheek teeth are worn to an effective grinding surface that is used to reduce food particles to a small enough size to be swallowed. There are a number of well-developed salivary glands. The cardia and pyloric sphincter are muscular and well-developed. The relatively voluminous stomach is simple in type and always contains food. The stomach contents comprise approximately 15% of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract. (B) The duodenum forms a loop with descending, transverse and ascending parts. It has an extensive mesentery. The duodenum begins with a slight enlargement approximately 1 cm from the pylorus that receives the bile duct. The right lobe of the pancreas is widely dispersed in the mesoduodenum as many isolated lobules. The main body and left lobe of the pancreas run in the mesentery that attaches the transverse colon to the stomach and spleen (see Figure 8 .2). A single accessory pancreatic duct opens into the junction between the descending and transverse duodenum. (C) The jejunum is long, convoluted and relatively free of attachments. It occupies the dorsal half of the left flank and the caudal half of the abdomen (see ). The ileum is closely associated with the mesentery that connects part of the ascending colon to the caecum to form the ileocaecocolic complex (see E). The end of the ileum is expanded into a thick-walled sacculus rotundus. (D) The caecum and appendix are shown as a straight tube, but are in fact a coiled spiral (see E). The thin-walled caecum is a large organ that ends in an appendix that is heavily endowed with lymphoid tissue. The ascending colon of the rabbit can be divided into four sections. The first section is approximately 10 cm long and has three longitudinal flat bands of muscular tissue or taeniae that separate rows of haustra or sacculations. Small protrusions, 'warzen' (warts), approximately 0.5 mm in diameter, can be seen on the mucosa in this section of colon. The second section of ascending colon is approximately 20 cm in length and has a single taenia and fewer, smaller haustra. The third portion of the ascending colon is termed the fusus coli and is a muscular area about 4 cm long. The fusus coli opens into the fourth section of ascending colon that is histologically indistinguishable from the transverse and descending colon. Because the fusus coli forms such a natural division between two morphologically and functionally distinct sections of the rabbit colon, the terms 'proximal' and 'distal' colon are sometimes used instead of ascending, transverse and descending colon (Snipes et al., 1982) . The proximal colon includes the three taeniae section, the single taenia section and the fusus coli. The distal colon is 80-100 cm long and runs from the fusus coli to the rectum. (E) A ventral view of the ileocaecocolic complex, which occupies more than half of abdomen, mainly on the right side (see Figures 1.13-1.15 ). The complex has been slightly unrolled in order to illustrate its component parts. There are mesenteric attachments between the caecum, appendix, proximal colon, ileum, distal colon and descending duodenum. These organs form a complex three-dimensional structure in rabbits. The term 'ileocaecocolic complex' is used to describe the structure in this text. The body of the caecum has a spiral form consisting of one and a half turns, ending in an appendix that extends to the right flank. The axis of the spiral is the base of the caecum that receives the end of the ileum in the form of the sacculus rotundus. The ileum lies between the concavity of the body of the caecum and the convexity of the upper ascending colon and is attached to these two structures by peritoneal folds. Because of their peritoneal attachments to the spiral caecum, the ileum and upper ascending colon are also arranged in a spiral, and are integral components of the ileocaecocolic complex. The upper ascending colon begins as a smooth oval dilation, the ampulla coli, that forms the junction with the sacculus rotundus and the caecum. Parts of the descending colon and descending duodenum are attached to the distal end of the caecum by peritoneal folds. The left lobe of the pancreas lies in the peritoneal fold between the descending duodenum and descending colon.",

A single pancreatic duct opens at the junction of the transverse and ascending loops of the duodenum (see Figure 1 .3B). This is the accessory pancreatic duct. The terminal part of the main pancreatic duct disappears during embryonic development. The accessory pancreatic duct communicates with both pancreatic lobes. The jejunum is long and convoluted. The end of the ileum is expanded into a spherical thick-walled enlargement known as the sacculus rotundus that forms the junction between the ileum, caecum and proximal colon. The sacculus rotundus is unique to the rabbit and has abundant aggregations of lymphoid tissue and macrophages in the lamina propria and submucosa. An ileocolic valve controls movement of digesta from the ileum into the sacculus rotundus and also prevents reverse flow into the small intestine. Motilin, a polypeptide hormone secreted by enterochromaffin cells of the duodenum and jejunum, stimulates gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Fat stimulates and carbohydrate inhibits its release. In the small intestine, motilin activity is decreased aborally. It disappears in the caecum and reappears in the colon and rectum .",

They are encapsulated in a gelatinous mucous coating that protects them from the acidity of the stomach. Some fermentation takes place within the caecotrophs as they lie in the gastric fundus for 6-8 hours before being digested. Lysozyme is secreted by the colon and incorporated into the caecotroph during its passage through the large intestine (Camara and Prieur, 1984) . The bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme enables microbial protein to be degraded and absorbed from the small intestine in addition to the amino acids and vitamins present in the caecotrophs. Amylase is produced by bacteria within the caecotroph that converts glucose into carbon dioxide and lactic acid, which is absorbed from the stomach and small intestine (Fekete, 1989) .",

Proteolytic enzymes and chymotrypsin can be found in the intestinal lumen within a few weeks of the operation. It is thought that small pancreatic ducts that connect directly with the duodenum are the source of the enzymes. Bicarbonate is secreted into the duodenum and neutralizes the acidic digesta as it leaves the stomach. In the jejunum bicarbonate is absorbed rather than secreted.

Small protrusions, approximately 0.5 mm in diameter, can be seen on the mucosa in this section of colon. These cauliflower-like protrusions have been termed warzen (warts) and are believed to be unique to lagomorphs. They represent an increase in the surface area of the colon that would favour increased absorption. The The motility and function of the hindgut can change depending on the type of faeces formed within the colon. The formation of hard faeces is known as the hard faeces phase and the expulsion of caecotrophs is known as the soft faeces phase. The phases of excretion follow a marked circadian rhythm. The hard faeces phase is shown in black. The soft faeces phase is shown in green. Exchange of water, electrolytes and nutrients across the intestinal epithelium alter with the phase of faeces excretion. The direction of water and electrolyte exchange is indicated by arrows. The proximal part of the ascending colon is able to separate digesta into two fractions that are simultaneously sent in opposite directions. During the hard faeces phase, water is secreted into the proximal colon and the intestinal contents are thoroughly mixed by contractions of the caecum and colon. Large indigestible particles (> 0.5 mm) tend to accumulate in the lumen of the proximal part of the ascending colon and are moved distally, whereas smaller particles accumulate at the circumference in the sac-like haustra. Haustrum is the Latin term for a pump. Haustral activity sends the small particles and fluid proximally into the caecum where bacterial fermentation takes place. The indigestible fraction, composed of large particles, is moved rapidly through the proximal colon to the fusus coli and distal colon where it is formed into hard, round, dry pellets that are excreted from the anus.

Haustral activity ceases and the caecum contracts, sending caecal material swiftly along the large intestine. In the fusus coli the material is formed into soft pellets that become encapsulated in mucus (see Figure 1 .5). This is the soft faeces phase of excretion when caecotrophs pass through the colon to be expelled from the anus. Expulsion of caecotrophs coincides with a decrease in rhythmic motility of the caecum and proximal colon, and increase in motility of the distal colon. Soft faeces or caecotrophs are expelled once or twice daily, at least 4 h after feeding, usually during periods of rest. The transit time for soft faeces through the colon is 1.5-2.5 times faster than that for hard faeces. Motility in the upper gastrointestinal tract remains the same during the hard and soft faeces phases. The differences in colonic motility during the hard and soft faeces phase of excretion are most pronounced in the second section of proximal colon that has a single row of haustra. The fusus coli is a specially adapted area of the colon that acts as a differential pacemaker for the initiation of peristaltic waves in the proximal and distal colon that alter with the phase of faeces excretion. The fusus coli is highly innervated and is influenced by hormones such as aldosterone and prostaglandins. During the hard faeces phase, the intestinal contents lose considerable quantities of water, potassium and sodium during their passage through the fusus coli. Water is mechanically squeezed out of the fibrous material before it passes to the distal colon where absorption of water, volatile fatty acids and electrolytes continues, leaving the residue of dry, indigestible matter that is expelled as hard faecal pellets.",

            "text": "The motility and function of the hindgut can change, depending on the type of faeces formed within the colon. The formation of hard faeces is known as the hard faeces phase and coincides with feeding activity. The expulsion of caecotrophs is known as the soft faeces phase. The phases of excretion follow a marked circadian rhythm. In caged rabbits with ad lib access to food, feed intake increases from 15.00 to 18.00 h and remains high until midnight. Intake then reduces until 02.00, when a new phase starts, with a maximum at 06.00, ending at 08.00 when the soft faeces phase begins. This natural pattern of feeding behaviour and faecal excretion can be seen in pet rabbits, although it may be altered by type and availability of food, age, pregnancy and lactation (Caraba\u00f1 o and Piquer, 1998) . During the hard faeces phase, water is secreted into the proximal colon, which aids the process of mixture and separation. Intestinal contents are thoroughly mixed by contractions of the caecum and colon that separate the digesta into large indigestible particles, and small particles including bacteria and water-soluble components. The indigestible fraction is moved rapidly through the proximal colon to the fusus coli and distal colon before being excreted from the anus. The fermentable fraction is moved in a retrograde direction back into the caecum. The large indigestible particles (> 0.5 mm) tend to accumulate in the lumen of the proximal part of the ascending colon and are moved distally, whereas smaller fermentable particles accumulate at the circumference in the sac-like haustra. Haustral activity sends the Figure 1 .5 Fusus coli. The fusus coli is a highly innervated, vascular, muscular section of the ascending colon (see Section 1.3.5). The fusus coli acts as a pacemaker for colonic motility that alters with the type of faeces that are passing through the colon. It is influenced by the autonomic nervous system and hormones such as aldosterone and prostaglandins. The mucosa of the fusus coli is deeply folded and contains many goblet cells. This plate shows the fusus coli of a rabbit that died during the morning when the colon was in the soft faeces phase. Pasty caecal material is passing into the fusus coli from the proximal colon (left). In the fusus coli, the intestinal contents are squeezed into pellets that become encapsulated in mucus before being excreted as soft caecotrophs. small particles proximally into the caecum. Caecal contractility is greatest during the hard faeces phase when the liquid intestinal contents are mixed and separated in the proximal colon. Periodically, the motility of the caecum and proximal colon alters completely. Haustral activity ceases and caecal material is moved swiftly along the large colon. In the fusus coli the material is then separated into pellets that become encapsulated in mucus. This is the soft faeces phase of excretion. Soft faeces or caecotrophs are expelled at least 4 h after feeding, usually during periods of rest.",

The third type of contraction of the proximal colon is a monophasic progressive wave of peristaltic contractions. These peristaltic contractions last about 5 seconds during the hard faeces phase and 1.5 seconds during the soft faeces phase (Ehrlein et al., 1982) .

Small particles are propelled into the caecum, which acts as a huge bacterial fermentation chamber to which nutrients and water are continually added. Studies of the enzymatic activities of the caecal microflora indicate that ammonia use, ureolysis, proteolysis and cellulysis take place in that order. Xylanolysis and pectinolysis also occur (Caraba\u00f1 o and Piquer, 1998) . The intestinal contents that reach the hindgut are composed of undigested food, excretion products and substances produced by the digestive tract itself. Small particles of complex carbohydrates such as oligosaccharides, cellulose, hemicellulose and pectins that are not digested in the small intestine reach the caecum for bacterial degradation. Plant proteins that are bound to cell wall constituents are also degraded in the caecum to form ammonia that is metabolized to amino acids by the caecal microflora. Products of intestinal cellular desquamation and digestive enzymes act as a nitrogen source for protein synthesis (Fraga, 1998) . Soluble ions such as urea are osmotically transferred across the caecal wall to be Rabbit Basic Science 1 metabolized. High protein diets increase blood urea levels and increase caecal ammonia levels (Fraga, 1998) . During periods of protein deprivation, urea from catabolism passes into the caecum to provide a nitrogen source for bacterial amino acid synthesis (Fekete, 1989) . Mucopolysaccharides secreted from goblet cells in the mucosa serve as a significant carbohydrate source for caecal fermentation. Bacteroides spp. ferment mucopolysaccharides (Cheeke, 1987) .",

The proportion and type of volatile fatty acids produced depend on the substrate metabolized and the species of bacteria present. In ruminants, the predominant volatile fatty acid is propionate, which is produced by Lactobacillus spp. present in the rumen but absent from the rabbit caecal microflora (Cheeke, 1987) . In rabbits, acetates predominate, followed by butyrate and propionate with small quantities of isobutyrate, isovalerate and valerate. Increased amounts of fibre in the diet increase the proportion of acetate that is produced. Lactate is produced by bacterial fermentation within the caecotroph in the stomach and is subsequently absorbed during digestion of the caecotroph in the small intestine. Considerable energy is required by the hindgut for the metabolism and absorption of volatile fatty Rabbit Basic Science acids, electrolytes and other nutrients. This energy is mainly supplied by butyrate produced by Bacteroides spp. that predominate in the caecal microflora. Rabbit caecal-colonic epithelial tissue metabolizes butyrate without the production of ketone bodies. Volatile fatty acids absorbed from intestinal tract provide a regular energy source for the rabbit. Lactate enters the portal circulation from the stomach and small intestine while volatile fatty acids originate from the hindgut. Net absorption from the digestive tract is greatest during the hard faeces phase, which is matched by increased hepatic metabolism and the removal of propionate and butyrate from the circulation, leaving acetate and lactate available for extrahepatic tissue metabolism (Caraba\u00f1 o and Piquer, 1998) . Due to alterations in hepatic metabolism, arterial concentrations of volatile fatty acids remain constant during both hard and soft phases of excretion, although their absorption and metabolism follow a circadian rhythm parallel to the activity of the adrenal gland (Vernay, 1987 ).",

In the colon, absorption or secretion of water varies in each section of the colon and depends on whether hard or soft faeces are being formed. During the soft faeces phase, caecal contents pass through the colon with relatively little change in composition. During the hard faeces phase water is secreted into the proximal colon and mixed with intestinal contents.

Their calcium metabolism has been studied extensively. Interestingly, blood phosphorus levels in the rabbit are tightly controlled and maintained at levels very similar to those of other species. This is a situation similar to that found in horses, who also have higher and more variable serum calcium levels than predicted while maintaining serum phosphorus levels analogous to those of other species and rigidly controlled. The relationship between calcium and phosphorus is well recognized, and it is difficult to look at calcium metabolism without considering that of phosphorus. Rabbits have evolved to live on pastures where calcium and phosphorus levels can vary widely over the year. In certain seasons rabbits must deal with high dietary calcium (typically during the summer) while over the winter, both calcium and phosphorus levels are very low. At times when dietary calcium is very low, rabbits rely on active calcium transport (vitamin D-dependent) in order to derive enough from the diet. When dietary phosphorus and hence blood levels are low, rabbits undergo significant calciuria as a mechanism for retaining phosphorus (Bourdeau et al., 1990; DePalo et al., 1988) . In wild rabbits, dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus vary annually, and levels of both these nutrients are low in late winter/early spring, prior to the rapid pasture growth (Table 1 .1).",

Reciprocal elevations in PTH or calcitonin in response to EDTA or calcium gluconate infusion indicates that these hormones regulate serum calcium concentrations in rabbits as in other species (Bourdeau et al., 1986; Warren et al., 1989) . However, rabbits appear to differ from humans in the level at which serum ionized calcium is set to initiate a parathyroid hormone (PTH) response (Warren et al., 1989) . This tends to maintain serum calcium at higher levels. The effect of this on serum phosphorus is that renal phosphorus Textbook of Rabbit Medicine excretion is initiated at higher calcium levels. The advantage of this is unknown; however, it is suggested that it is a mechanism for the rabbit to successfully cope with wide variations in dietary calcium and phosphorus. An analogy has been made with the syndrome of benign familial hypercalcaemia in humans, which is a genetic condition characterized by hypercalcaemia without changes in renal function, blood pressure or any other potential sequels to chronic hypercalcaemia such as soft tissue mineralization. Not only do rabbits have higher total serum calcium concentrations than other species but also they are different in the way calcium is absorbed from the gut and excreted by the kidney. Calcium can be absorbed from the intestinal tract either by passive diffusion or by active transport across the mucosa. In other mammals the amount of calcium taken up by the body is strictly controlled; however, in rabbits calcium uptake is directly proportional to the amount found in the diet, and any excess is excreted through the kidney. Active transportation involves a carrier protein that is synthesized in the intestinal mucosa in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , the active metabolite of vitamin D. A drop in serum calcium concentration stimulates PTH release, which, in turn, stimulates the conversion of biologically inert 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 in the kidney, thereby indirectly increasing the absorption of calcium from the intestine (Chapin and Smith, 1967a) .",

Briefly, indigestible fibre is separated from fermentable components in the proximal colon and is rapidly eliminated in hard faecal pellets. The fermentable components, which consist of small particles and fluid, are moved back into the caecum where bacterial fermentation takes place to release volatile fatty acids that are absorbed as an energy source. Caecal contents are expelled periodically as mucusencapsulated caecotrophs that are re-ingested and digested as a source of amino acids and vitamins. This strategy permits the digestion of large volumes of fibrous foods without storage in the gastrointestinal tract. Digestion can take place when the rabbit is below ground and not vulnerable to predation. Since their domestication, rabbits have been fed on a variety of diets. During the Second World War in the UK, when food was scarce, backyard rabbits were kept as a source of protein that could survive on weeds, household scraps and foods that the producer could grow himself. This still occurs in many developing countries where rabbits are fed on a range of forage materials. Large-scale rabbit production has led to the development of pelleted foods of known analysis suitable for commercial rabbits.",

Nutritional disease is common in rabbits kept as pets. For owners, providing food that is eaten readily and enjoyed is one of the most rewarding aspects of keeping a rabbit. The visual appearance of food influences the owner when choosing a product, so pelleted diets became unpopular and a wide range of visually attractive, highly coloured cereal mixes evolved as 'rabbit food' in the UK. These diets are cheap to produce and many are put together by food compounders that normally make rations for farm animals. The choice of ingredients is based on general nutritional principles combined with cost and availability of ingredients. Scientific, long-term feeding trials are not carried out. The nutrient value, vitamin and mineral content of a diet is calculated by extrapolating figures taken from data tables of ingredients rather than analysing the food itself. In recent years, however, several companies have started to produce scientifically formulated mono-component pelleted and extruded feeds. These have been based on research and feeding trials and are nutritionally superior to many of the 'muesli'-type mixes. The advantage of these types of premium feeds are a reduction in the likelihood of nutrient deficiency; the disadvantage is the way that many of these pellets need to be chewed (a more vertical chewing motion, compared with the more lateral movement seen when a rabbit chews hay or vegetation) that can lead to dental problems. A good compromise is to feed ad lib hay and a small amount of good-quality pellets and to offer a selection of fresh vegetables daily. The Rabbit Welfare Association and the RSPCA support this recommendation. A hay and fresh food-only diet, which is as close to the natural diet as possible, should be viewed as the optimum; however, many owners can't or won't comply with this.",

Starch is found in plants as granules that are insoluble in cold water, but when a suspension of starch in water is heated, the granules swell and eventually gelatinize. Gelatinized starches can form complexes with proteins that reduce the digestibility of both starch and protein (Cheeke, 1987) . Feed manufacturing processes and exogenous enzyme supplements also affect starch digestibility . Pancreatic amylase is the most important enzyme, and as dietary levels of starch increase, more amylase is secreted. Most starch is broken down into glucose and directly absorbed.

Excess starch reaching the caecum or 'carbohydrate overload' is thought to be a predisposing factor in the development of enterotoxaemia in young rabbits. Clostridium spiroforme requires glucose as a substrate for iota toxin production and glucose is yielded during bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate (Cheeke, 1987) . In commercial units, enterotoxaemia is seen in young rabbits in association with high carbohydrate, low fibre diets. However, the situation is different in the adult pet rabbit where the sensitivity to high starch diets is controversial (Lowe, 1998) . Recent work has indicated that there is a difference in starch digestibility between young and adult rabbits. Adult rabbits appear to digest starch more efficiently than young ones. Very small amounts of starch reach the caecocolic segment of adults. Even in lactating rabbits that consume high quantities of carbohydrate, almost all the starch is hydrolysed before it reaches the caecum . Therefore the role of starch as a predisposing factor for imbalances of the caecal microflora and the development of enteric disorders remains unclear. Experimental work has given conflicting results Cheeke, 1987) . However, the general consensus of opinion is that overload of rapidly fermentable carbohydrates in the large intestine increases the likelihood of digestive disorders, at least in susceptible, recently weaned rabbits. Dietary starch has no influence on the chemical composition of caecal contents or on the production or composition of soft and hard faeces (Caraba\u00f1 o et al., 1988 Dietary fibre is an important component of the diet for rabbits (see Box 1.2). Fibre is defined as 'that portion of ingested foodstuffs that cannot be broken down by intestinal enzymes and juices of monogastric animals and therefore passes through the small intestine and colon undigested' (Blood and Studdert, 1999) . This definition is confusing in ruminants and hindgut fermenters because the gut flora breaks down and 'digests' some fibre molecules by microbial fermentation. Therefore, in herbivores, fibre can be either 'digestible' or 'indigestible' and digestibility varies with species and their digestive physiology. The term 'fermentable' fibre can also be used to describe digestible fibre that is broken down by microbial fermentation. In rabbits, fibre is separated in the proximal colon into large and small particles. Particles larger than 0.5 mm do not enter the caecum and are swiftly expelled undigested. This is the indigestible fibre component of the diet. Particles smaller than 0.3 mm are moved into the caecum where they are digested by bacterial fermentation. This component of the diet is known as digestible or fermentable fibre. Within the caecum the digestibility of fibre depends on the chemical composition and size of the particle. The ease with which bacteria can degrade fibre particles depends on the molecular structure and chemical properties of the fibre and the surface area to which the bacteria can adhere.",

Some precaecal digestion of fibre takes place by enzymes in the stomach and small intestine. Fibre that reaches the hindgut is either degraded by caecal microflora or expelled undigested. The proximal colon is adapted to separate indigestible fibre from fibre that can be fermented in the caecum. Large undigestible fibre particles pass into the colon and are expelled rapidly. Small particles pass into the caecum to undergo bacterial fermentation. Indigestible fibre promotes gut motility but does not have any nutrient value. Digestible (fermentable) fibre provides nutrients but has no direct effect on gut motility. In rabbits, there is evidence that partial digestion of fibre can take place in the stomach and small intestine by the action of enzymes such as pectinases and xylanases . However, most digestion of fibre takes place by the microbial flora within the caecum. Digestibility within the caecum depends on the nature of the plant material and, to a lesser extent, processing procedures. Hemicelluloses and pectins are broken down more easily than cellulose, which requires degradation by cellulolytic bacteria and requires time for attachment of the bacteria to the cell wall before degradation starts. Degradation of cellulose takes longer than hemicellulose because of its linear polymer structure , so it is less fermentable than hemicellulose. Cellulose can be closely associated, both chemically and physically, with other compounds such as hemicellulose and pectin and affect their digestibility. It can also be combined with lignin. The digestibility of fibre within the caecum affects the rabbit's appetite and growth rate. Grinding down lignin so that it passes into the caecum depresses voluntary food intake in comparison with cellulose that is more fermentable (Chiou et al., 1998) . The chemical structure of fibre molecules gives them a buffering capacity that is dependent on the concentration of carboxyl, amino and hydroxyl groups . The type of fibre has an effect on caecal pH, which, in turn, can affect the balance of caecal microflora. For example, wheat straw tends to increase caecal pH, whereas beet pulp decreases it. Balanced sources of fibre such as alfalfa do not modify caecal pH .",

Digestibility of lignified material can be increased by alkali treatment to dissolve lignin and release cellulose and other compounds for microbial degradation. Grinding down lignin to small particles causes it to be retained in the caecum where it cannot be digested. The degree of grinding is an important consideration as it alters the way in which fibre is separated in the proximal colon. Grinding fibre to particles small enough to be moved into the caecum rather than colon detracts from the beneficial effect of indigestible fibre on intestinal motility. There is general agreement that screen sizes for production of complete compound feeds should be 2 mm. Screen sizes of 1 mm induce digestive upsets (Lowe, 1998) .",

A diet deficient in fibrous material has been implicated in cheek tooth overgrowth (Crossley, 1995) . Diets low in indigestible fibre predispose to gastrointestinal hypomotility and the retention of food and hair in the stomach, which forms trichobezoars (hairballs). Slow gut motility and increased food retention time in the hindgut can result in alterations in gut flora and the development of enterotoxaemia. The provision of a diet high in indigestible fibre to house rabbits reduces the ingestion of non-food items such as carpet fibres or plastic litter trays. Fur chewing and barbering is also linked to low fibre diets (Quesenberry, 1994) . Diets containing low dietary fibre depress voluntary food intake (Bellier and Gidenne, 1996) .",

Alfalfa is a source of fibre used in commercial rabbit diets in many countries. Alfalfa hay not only provides fibre but also has a high calcium content. Alfalfa hay is now commonly available in the UK. Meadow hay suitable for feeding to pet rabbits is available from most pet shops. Meadow hay is preferable to alfalfa for pet rabbits. Fresh grass is the ideal food and rabbits have evolved to live on it. Garden weeds are also a source of fibre and give variety to the diet.

A diet containing gluco-oligosaccharides that release glucose after hydrolysis in the caecum causes diarrhoea in young rabbits, whereas fructo-or galacto-oligosaccharides do not have the same effect (Lebas et al., 1998) . Currently, there is considerable interest in fructo-oligosaccharides because they are reputed to be beneficial in the human gastrointestinal tract by providing the correct substrate for the proliferation of desirable bacterial species such as bifidobacteria (Campbell et al., 1997) . Certain plants such as chicory, asparagus, bananas and artichokes contain fructo-oligosaccharides that stimulate the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. in the human colon: hence the term 'bifidogenesis', which may be used to describe this effect. Fructo-oligosaccharides have been called 'prebiotics', as the principle of their beneficial effects is similar to probiotics, i.e. to encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibit pathogenic species. Fructo-oligosaccharides are utilized by Bacteroides spp. that prevail in healthy caecal microflora of rabbits. Fructo-oligosaccharides increase calcium, magnesium and iron absorption from the colon and rectum of rats (Ohta et al., 1995a,b) and reduce serum triglyceridaemia in humans (Roberfroid, 1997) . In rabbits, a reduction in morbidity after the introduction of pathogenic E. coli has been reported in rabbits fed on a fructo-oligosaccharide-supplemented diet (Maertens and Villamide, 1998) .

Irradiated plant sterols with anti-rachitic potency occur in the dead leaves of plants or sun-cured hays rather than in the green During the spring, blood samples were taken from seven rabbits that lived in hutches and four rabbits that had been kept under free-range conditions with unlimited access to natural daylight through the winter months.

Variation in the vitamin D content of hay can occur with different methods of curing. Exposure to irradiation by sunlight for long periods causes a marked increase in anti-rachitic potency of cut fodder, whereas modern haymaking techniques with its emphasis on rapid curing tends to keep vitamin D levels at a minimum (Blood et al., 1979) . Rabbits enjoy eating dried vegetation such as fallen tree leaves in the autumn and will often eat them in preference to the grass available at that time. This is where they get oral vitamin D intake in the wild. There is also an interaction between vitamin A and vitamin D. Vitamin A appears to intensify the severity of rickets and inhibit the ability of vitamin D to cure the disease. Vitamin A administration to rats produced a decrease in total bone ash, increased the epiphyseal bone width and eliminated the ability of vitamin D to elevate serum calcium levels in a study by Rohde et al. (1999) . Commercial rabbit pellets are supplemented with vitamin D. In a study by Warren et al. (1989) rabbits from a breeding farm were found to have blood levels of 25-OH-D ten times higher than their laboratory counterparts despite comparable 1,25(OH 2 )D values. The diet of the farmed rabbits contained 2200 IU/kg of vitamin D; yet PTH and serum total and ionized calcium values were not statistically different from the laboratory rabbits. Vitamin D toxicity has caused soft tissue mineralization in rabbits that were erroneously fed excessive quantities of supplement (Zimmerman et al., 1990) . Dietary levels above 2300 IU/kg appear to be toxic (Cheeke, 1987) . A level of 800-1200 IU/kg is recommended for pet rabbits (Lowe, 1998) . In view of the risk of inducing vitamin D toxicity by dietary administration, it seems sensible to expose rabbits to sunlight so they can synthesize their own vitamin D rather than rely on dietary supplementation. Sunlight has many beneficial physiological and psychological effects.",

Vitamin E is a natural antioxidant that inactivates the peroxides that cause widespread tissue damage. Vitamin E is also involved in blood clotting, stability of membrane structure and maintenance of immunity. Vitamin E and/or selenium deficiency classically results in nutritional muscular dystrophy, which has been described in rabbits (see Section 10.6.1.4). Other effects of deficiency include myocardial damage, exudative diathesis, Results of owner questionnaire: food preference of pet rabbits. Ninety rabbit owners completed a questionnaire about the feeding habits of their pet. All the rabbits were fed on mixed rations purchased as 'rabbit food'. Hay was offered to all the rabbits in the survey although they did not always eat it. Some rabbits were given additional vegetables or allowed to graze in a run periodically through the summer months. In nearly every case, a bowl of 'rabbit food' was left with the rabbit permanently. Discarded food was thrown away and the bowl topped once or twice daily. This feeding practice allowed rabbits to select their favourite food items and eat nothing else. Some rabbits existed on one or two ingredients. The low calcium cereals and peas were the rabbits' favourite part of the ration. The pellets that contain a vitamin and mineral supplement were the least palatable part of the mixture. However, some rabbits would eat the entire mixture and a minority would select the pellets.

It is an important cation in intracellular and extracellular fluid and is essential for blood clotting, muscle contractions, nerve cell activity, hormone regulation and the maintenance and stability of cell membranes. Rabbits require a constant supply of calcium for their teeth that continually erupt at a rate of approximately 2 mm per week. Calcium metabolism and its unusual aspects in rabbits are discussed in Section 1.3.12 and Key Points 1.6. Briefly, rabbits absorb calcium readily from the diet and do not homeostatically maintain blood levels as closely as other species. Total serum calcium levels vary across a wide range and are higher than in other mammals. Increased dietary calcium levels bring about an increase in serum calcium (Chapin and Smith, 1967a) , which is excreted in the urine in the form of calcium carbonate, which gives the urine a thick creamy appearance (Cheeke and Amberg, 1973) . Urinary calcium levels are also related to dietary calcium intake (Kennedy, 1965) . Absorption of calcium across the intestinal mucosa is achieved by two parallel processes: active vitamin D-dependent transcellular transport (unidirectional) and passive paracellular diffusion across a concentration gradient, a bidirectional process (Breslau, 1996) . In the rabbit, the main mechanism of calcium absorption appears to be passive diffusion, although active transport is important if dietary levels are low. Passive diffusion is bidirectional and depends on the concentration gradient between the intestinal lumen and the blood. Calcium is absorbed primarily in its ionic form and compounds that bind with calcium to form Textbook of Rabbit Medicine insoluble complexes reduce its availability, e.g., oxalates (Breslau, 1996) . The solubility of minerals such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus in intestinal contents is affected by pH. For example, calcium absorption is increased in horses fed a high fibre diet due to lower stomach pH and increased saliva and pancreatic secretions that increase the solubility of calcium in the gut (Meyer et al., 1992) . It is not known whether an analogous situation exists in the rabbit. Phytates, oxalates and acetates form complexes with calcium and other minerals and can prevent absorption (Fowler, 1986) . Phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphoric) is present in high quantities in grains and beans. Oxalates are present in a number of plants including swede, spinach and alfalfa in which 20-30% of the calcium is in the form of calcium oxalate that reduces its availability. In a study by Cheeke et al. (1985) , 49% of the calcium in calcium oxalate was available to rabbits. Low oxalate, high calcium vegetables include kale, broccoli, turnip, collard and mustard greens (Breslau, 1996) . Calcium can also bind with long-chain unsaturated fatty acids in the intestine to form insoluble soaps.",

Calcium deficiency can be a contributory factor to poor tooth and bone quality and dental disease in pet rabbits. The selection of cereals and legumes from mixed rations results in a diet containing less in calcium than the amount required for bone calcification (Table 1. 3) (Harcourt- Brown, 1995 Brown, , 1996 .

Therefore, Samples of rabbit food were taken from batches of mixed rations bought from the same three pet shops on three different occasions. One pound (0.45 kg) of food was sent for analysis. The remainder of the batch was picked over to remove the whole grain and the pellets, which are the ingredients most likely to be rejected by pet rabbits (see Figure 1 .8). One pound (0.45 kg) of the remaining ration (without pellets and grain) was sent for analysis. Figures in bold denote an inverse calcium:phosphorus ratio. NB.

Rabbits have evolved to live on grass, which they find palatable and enjoyable. Ideally, pet rabbits should be given the opportunity to graze for several hours a day. If a predator-free enclosure cannot be provided, then fresh grass can be picked daily throughout the summer months to feed to pet rabbits. Clippings from the lawn mower are not suitable as they ferment rapidly. There is a small risk of transmitting parasites from wild rabbits, dogs and foxes through grass collected from contaminated pasture. Viral haemorrhagic disease vaccination is advisable. If fresh grass is unavailable, then hay can be provided as a substitute. Hay and grass can be offered together. Preserved grasses such as 'Readigrass' are a suitable addition to the diet. The calcium and fibre content is similar to hay, and it helps to wear the teeth down in a similar manner. Natural grasslands are made up of a number of grass species and include legumes and other wild plants. The chemical composition of the pasture alters throughout the year. Grass grows rapidly during warm, wet weather and dries out as the herbage matures, leaving a feed resource that is sometimes referred to as 'standing hay ' (McDonald et al., 1996) . The crude protein content of pasture grass can vary from 0.3% in mature herbage to 3% in young heavily fertilized grass. The fibre content tends to increase as the protein levels decrease. The water-soluble carbohydrates of grass include glucose, fructose and sucrose and vary with the species. The cellulose content is generally 20-30% and hemicelluloses vary from 10 to 30% (McDonald et al., 1996) . Lignin content increases with age and affects the availability of other nutrients except the water-soluble carbohydrates. The lipid composition is low and rarely exceeds 0.6%. The mineral content varies with species, stage of growth, soil type, cultivation conditions and fertilizer application. Green herbage is a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin E and many B vitamins, especially riboflavin. The vitamin D content increases as grass matures and is present in greater quantities in sun-dried hay than in young grass.",

The aim of haymaking is to reduce the moisture content of the green crop to a level low enough to inhibit the action of plant and microbial enzymes. Valuable nutrients are lost during the drying process due to the action of enzymes, oxidation, leaching and mechanical damage. The vitamin content of hay depends on the manner in which it was dried and the length of exposure to sunlight. Prolonged exposure to sunlight increases the vitamin D content, whereas rapid drying preserves the vitamin A content. Increased drying time allows bacterial fermentation to take place and rain on a partly dried crop leaches out minerals and encourages the growth of moulds (McDonald et al., 1996) .

In the USA, alfalfa is used for grazing and for artificial drying to make hay. In the UK, some alfalfa is grown and harvested for silage or for artificial drying to make hay. The drying process can affect the vitamin D content. Dried alfalfa is approximately 25% crude fibre and is also rich in protein, calcium and vitamin A. It is high in oxalate that binds with calcium in the gut and affects absorption. Alfalfa can easily be grown under dry conditions and has proven to be a useful feed for rabbits in many parts of the world. In the UK, alfalfa is recognized as a useful foodstuff for rabbits,and is increasingly used as a source of both fibre and calcium in many proprietary foods. In tandem with the increased interest in lower calcium manufactured Rabbit Basic Science foods, there has been a backlash against alfalfa within the rabbit community, making it less popular as an ingredient, due to its high calcium levels and many rabbit owners are now very aware that alfalfa hay is not an appropriate feedstuff. Some breeders use a high fibre horse food made from alfalfa to feed to rabbits. Alfalfa is retained in the digestive tract for longer than plain cellulose, suggesting that it is digested to some degree in the caecum (Chiou et al., 1998) .",

Disadvantages of pelleted diets are their low palatability in comparison with mixed cereal rations (often leading to the addition of simple sugars in order to improve this) and the owners' perception that they look boring.

However, most rabbits are able to separate and eat the kernel and leave the husk uneaten. Wheat has a tendency to be pasty (Lowe, 1998) and is usually extruded into a coloured biscuit that is included in mixed rations. Pellets are added to the mixture as a vehicle for a powdered vitamin and mineral supplement. Some brands now incorporate the supplement into the extruded wheat portion or spray the whole mixture with a supplemented coating. The advantages of mixed rations are that they are universally available, palatable, cheap, convenient and visually attractive to the owner. They are available from pet shops, supermarkets, agricultural suppliers, garages, garden centres and wholesalers under the universal name of 'rabbit food'. Apart from the general problems associated with feeding ad lib concentrated foods (obesity, insufficient dietary fibre, dental exercise and foraging), mixed cereal rations have the additional disadvantage of allowing rabbits to select out their favourite ingredients and leave the rest uneaten (see Figure 1 .8). Discarded food is generally taken away by the owner and replaced with a fresh bowlful for the rabbit to select from. Owners worry about their pets being bored or hungry and sometimes refill the bowl several times a day so the rabbit may exist on only one or two favourite ingredients. In order to be nutritionally balanced, this type of food must be fed full to empty bowl. The pellets, which contain the vitamin and mineral supplement, are often left uneaten. The most palatable portions of these diets are the flaked peas and flaked maize which are deficient in calcium and have a low calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. Selection of these ingredients results in a diet with calcium concentrations below the rabbit's known dietary requirement (Harcourt-Brown, 1996) . Demineralization of the bones and teeth results in dental problems (see Section 5.5.1.1). A balanced diet is especially important to juvenile rabbits that are growing rapidly and therefore susceptible to metabolic bone disease. Selection of low calcium cereals and legumes from mixed rations at this stage can have life-long detrimental effects on bones and teeth.",

Rabbits will eat almost anything, including plants known to be toxic to other species and so it is not easy to reassure Rabbit Basic Science owners that their pet will not suffer any adverse effects. Toxicity varies and depends on a number of factors, such as the amount ingested, the part of the plant that is eaten and the frequency of ingestion. Drying can cause an increase or decrease in toxicity or have no effect at all. Many plants that contain toxic compounds are acrid and unpalatable. Irritant compounds cause oral discomfort and are unlikely to be ingested in large quantities. Many plant poisons are not fatal and so the fact that a pet rabbit has eaten a known poisonous plant does not necessarily mean it will die. Conversely, plants that are considered safe can be toxic if ingested in large quantities or daily over a period of time. Examples in other species include apples or clover, both of which can cause digestive upsets in ruminants. In general, if no ill effects are observed within 6 h of the ingestion of a potentially poisonous plant, then it is unlikely that signs will develop (Veterinary Poisons Unit, personal communication).",

Hyperthermia, methaemoglobinaemia, jaundice and pulmonary oedema are among the clinical signs. Ingestion of hay grown from a monoculture sprayed with a selective herbicide such as a triazine can cause poisoning. Treated, triazineresistant weeds are dried and eaten in contaminated hay. Symptoms of poisoning in other species are non-specific and include anorexia, weight loss, depression, salivation, muscle atonia, weakness and paraplegia or hyperexcitability. Treatment is symptomatic and the prognosis generally good. Garden fungicides that are used to treat lawns also belong to the triazine group.

A high fibre, low calorie diet that would result in weight loss in humans and other animals may not have any effect in rabbits.

Quantities of cereal mixtures or pellets should be reduced or phased out over a couple of weeks. Eventually a diet of ad lib hay or grass with no concentrates can be given until the rabbit has lost weight. Small amounts of vegetables can be given as treat foods. As much exercise as possible is important. The weight loss must be maintained in the long term, and a return to old feeding habits avoided.

The rabbit kidney is adapted for the excretion of large amounts of calcium (see Section 1.3.12). Intestinal absorption is related to the calcium content of the diet and excess amounts are excreted by the kidney. Therefore the amount of calcium carbonate precipitate varies with the calcium content of the diet. The hydration status of the animal and pH of the urine also affect the amount of precipitate. The urine can be clear during periods of high calcium demand such as growth, pregnancy or lactation. A small amount of precipitate is a good sign as it reflects adequate calcium content in the diet. Excessive precipitate can form a thick sludge, especially in the bladder of rabbits that do not urinate frequently (see Section 12.4). High dietary calcium levels exacerbate the problem. Cystitis, urethritis and urinary incontinence can be the result. It can be difficult to differentiate between normal calcium carbonate deposits and abnormal amounts of sludge. Normal rabbit urine is often radiopaque. Calcium carbonate deposits in the urine of an otherwise healthy animal with no sign of urinary tract disease do not require treatment; however, it should be recognized that if the situation changes the calcium deposits may become clinically significant.

Very excitable or aggressive rabbits can be caught and removed from the carrier in a towel. Picking rabbits up by their ears is not acceptable and is no longer advocated, although it is recommended in some older texts. After being removed from the carrier, it is often useful to allow the rabbit to hop around the floor of the consulting room as long as this is safe. In this way the rabbit can become acquainted with a new environment, and important information about its general condition and mobility can be gained. Alternatively the rabbit can be held on the consulting table and observed while a clinical history is being obtained from the owner. To examine the perineum, the rabbit can be restrained in dorsal recumbency either by holding the scruff and lying the rabbit on its back or by cradling it like a baby in the arms of an assistant or the owner. Dorsal recumbency may evoke an immobility response but can be a source of stress, leading to kicking and struggling.

A large towel is placed on the table and the rabbit placed on top of it before being wrapped up so the whole body is enclosed with only the head exposed. An assistant, who may be the owner, is needed to hold the rabbit firmly against them or pressed gently on to the table. The front legs can be held. Jackson (1991) found that restraining laboratory rabbits by wrapping them securely in a towel not only reduced the stress of handling but also reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal stasis. It is important to remember that rabbits can still cause themselves harm whilst wrapped in a towel, and isometric contraction of the powerful lumbar muscles can result in spinal fracture. Attention to the behaviour of the rabbit being examined and modification of approach if struggling occurs is less likely to result in injury to either handler or patient.",

On one hand, some practitioners lie rabbits on their backs to perform a variety of procedures such as nail clipping, oral administration of medicines and even inserting mouth gags to examine or clip molars. On the other hand, there is a view that the immobility response occurs in stressful situations and that rabbits lying on their backs are terrified and waiting to be eaten.

The more highly a species is preyed upon, the easier it is to induce the response. The immobility response is a transitory and reversible state of profound motor inhibition. The phenomenon is characterized by lack of spontaneous movement and failure to respond to external stimuli for several minutes. In rabbits, there is hypotonia of flexor and extensor musculature, abolition of the righting reflex, depression of spinal reflexes, miosis and a drop in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate. An awareness of external stimuli is maintained, although there is a decreased response to noise and painful stimuli (Danneman et al., 1988) . This trance-like state is induced in the laboratory by placing the rabbit in dorsal recumbency, covering its eyes with its ears and flexing its chin against the neck. The hind legs are stretched out for a few minutes before releasing the legs and gently stroking the chest and abdomen. As long as the head is flexed, the rabbit remains immobile and restraining devices have been designed to maintain this position (Bivin, 1994) .",

Sudden noise or painful stimuli can interrupt the trance and there is considerable variation in individual susceptibility to the technique. In a study by Danneman et al. (1988) , the immobility response could not be evoked in 25% of rabbits. In the consulting room, some pet rabbits can be calmed and restrained by placing them in dorsal or lateral recumbency and gently stroking their stomach while quietly speaking to them.

In trials conducted at the University of Edinburgh, the rib area proved to be the most useful for assessing body fat, with the hips and spine only showing appreciable changes at extremes of body weight. The ribs are felt just behind the elbow and the amount of pressure required to feel the ribs is assessed. The greater the pressure required, the more fat is present (Table 1.8).",

The response to pain is to become quiet, immobile and oblivious of the surroundings. Visceral problems such as gut stasis or urolithiasis appear to be more distressing to rabbits than the abscesses or fractures. Occasionally, overt signs of pain such as tooth grinding can be evident. This is usually associated with visceral pain, especially impactive intestinal problems such as mucoid enteropathy (see Section 8.9). Intestinal obstruction is associated with severe depression and immobility, which gives a characteristic clinical presentation (see Box 1.8). The presence of spurs on the molars that traumatize the sensitive mucosa of the tongue is also very painful for rabbits. Intestinal obstruction in pet rabbits gives a characteristic clinical presentation. The most common cause of obstruction is a felt of hair that is groomed out of the coat, especially the hind feet, during moulting. Dried pulses, foreign objects, tumours and tapeworm cysts are among other causes of obstruction (see Chapter 8). If the condition is recognized early and surgery is performed promptly, there is a reasonable chance of success. If the condition is not recognized and treated, the rabbit will die unless the foreign body happens to pass into the colon.",

With the increased availability of good veterinary care many more rabbits are achieving a long life expectancy. It is difficult to age living rabbits with any degree of accuracy. The epiphyseal line in the tibia closes at approximately 9 months of age. The epiphyses of the lumbar vertebrae close much later. Counting the adhesion lines in the periosteal zone of the mandible by histopathological examination can be used to age mature rabbits accurately (Henderson and Bowen, 1979) but this is not possible during life. The deciduous teeth are shed at birth and so the only criteria to make an assessment of age during clinical examination are the size and appearance of the rabbit, both of which vary according to breed and state of health and experience. The claws of the rabbit do not project beyond the fur until the rabbit reaches maturity (Sandford, 1996) , but this age varies according to breed and size. Fanciers may be able to give an indication of age by feeling the ears, which are soft in young rabbits and become tougher with age (Sandford, 1996) . Pedigree rabbits may have rings over their hocks on which the year of birth will be recorded. Smaller breeds mature at 4-5 months of age and the larger breeds mature at 5-8 months (Donnelly, 1997) . Bucks reach puberty later than does, so immature females housed with their brothers are unlikely to conceive even though the buck may mount and appear to mate her. Obviously, the two sexes should be separated or neutered at this stage if pregnancy is to be prevented.",

There are many clinical conditions that can prevent a rabbit from licking and grooming properly (see Figure 1 .9), which are manifested by a dull coat full of dead hair and skin debris. Combing through the fur with a flea comb gives an idea of the amount of dead hair and debris and also reveals the presence of fleas, flea dirt or mites. Mites can just be seen with the naked eye, especially under good illumination. A magnifying glass can be used to examine the fur thoroughly. Microscopic examination of skin brushings or sellotape strips confirms their presence and gives an idea of numbers. Most rabbits have some degree of infestation, which is not always significant; however, extensive infestation can be a sign that something is causing stress to the animal or preventing grooming (see Section 7.14.2). The areas of skin between the shoulder blades and above the base of the tail are difficult for the rabbit to reach and groom, especially if it obese or has limited flexibility due to spondylosis (see Figure 1.19) . Cheyletiellosis often starts to become evident on the back of the neck and along the dorsum. During the summer, soiled fur at the base of the tail or the perineum must be examined closely for the presence of maggots. The area under the dewlap is prone to superficial pyoderma, predisposed by factors such as poor hygiene, dental disease or obesity. Some rabbits are unable to drink without immersing their dewlap in the water bowl, leading to wet macerated skin and dermatitis or myiasis. Excess salivation as a result of dental disease can result in a wet dewlap that is prone to bacterial infection. Fat rabbits with excessive skin folds and large dewlaps experience problems grooming and may lick the cranial surface of the dewlap obsessively as a type of displacement activity because they cannot groom other areas such as the underside of the dewlap or the perineum which is infected, inflamed and sore. Steatitis within the fat of the dewlap can also lead to chronic skin mutilation. This can be the result of previous trauma.",

Neurological deficits, abdominal pain or generalized weakness can also lead to urine scalding or perineal soiling. Skin inflammation in the perineal area may be caused by uneaten caecotrophs that have become adherent to the fur and caused superficial pyoderma of the skin beneath. Obesity, dental disease and arthritis prevent grooming around the perineum so the fur becomes matted, soiled and infected. This starts a vicious circle that can be broken by clipping and cleaning the perineal area and treating the painful dermatitis (see Figure 7 .1 and Section 7.7.3). Clippers can be used to remove most of the fur. A sharp pair of curved, pointed scissors is useful for teasing out and cutting matted hair around the genitalia and under the tail. Dead and matted hair can be combed out with a flea comb. It is very easy inadvertently to damage the delicate skin. Patience and the correct equipment are required. Sedation may be needed.

In some cases of gastric stasis, the stomach may be felt as a hard round mass just behind the ribs on the right-hand side.

Gas distension of the caecum can result from gastrointestinal hypomotility. In these cases, the caecum may not be differentiated from other organs or can be felt as a gas-filled structure that makes a sloshing sound when palpated. The bladder can be felt in the caudoventral abdomen. It should be palpated with care as it can rupture easily, especially if the urethra is partially obstructed by a urolith.

Rabbits do not mouth breathe or pant effectively. Respiratory rate varies between 32 and 60 breaths per minute. Increased respiratory rates are indicative of stress, pain, hyperthermia, infection or respiratory disease. Metabolic acidosis can also be manifested by an increased respiratory rate. On occasion some rabbits appear to have a very rapid respiratory rate without significant disease. This circumstance is known as 'paradoxical breathing' and is related to reduced vagal tone causing increased diaphragmatic activity and 'augmented' breaths (Whipp, 1987) . Upper respiratory tract disease is common in rabbits (see Section 11.2.3). Occlusion of the nasal passage results in increased respiratory effort and may be accompanied by various snuffles, squeaks and whistles. Some short-nosed breeds always make this type of noise. The differentiation between upper and lower airway disease can be made by observation and auscultation and examination of the nose. An increase in respiratory rate is brought about by an increase in diaphragmatic rather than intercostal movement and can give the impression of dyspnoea. Dyspnoea is manifested by cyanosis, mouth breathing, depression and distress and may be accompanied by an audible respiratory noise. Abnormal, absent or muffled lung sounds may be heard during thoracic auscultation of rabbits with lower respiratory disease. Chronic lung disease cannot be ruled out by auscultation of the chest, although use of a suitably sized paediatric stethoscope can be helpful as it allows more precise examination. Severe lung changes are a frequent incidental finding during post-mortem examination. Abnormal heart sounds can sometimes be detected, although cardiac disease is rare in rabbits in comparison with lung disease. The list of differential diagnoses of dyspnoea is similar to other species.",

The test paper is inserted into the lower conjunctival fold in the lateral third of the eyelid and is held in place for 1 minute. The amount of wetness is measured in millimetres. Topical anaesthesia is not used. Normal values range from 0 to 11.22 mm/min, with a mean of 5.30 \u00fe 2.96 having been determined. Low values are of doubtful significance (Abrams et al., 1990) , although absence of tear production can be a sign of dysautonomia. A low Schirmer tear test result indicates keratoconjunctivitis sicca in other species but this condition has not been reported to occur naturally in rabbits. Impaired tear drainage due to nasolacrimal duct disease can result in high Schirmer tear test results. Excessive tear production can also be associated with corneal irritation due to conjunctivitis, corneal abrasions, ulcerations or foreign bodies. Orbital pain may be due to uveitis, glaucoma or retrobulbar disease. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus and internal structures of the eye requires mydriasis. Rabbits produce atropine esterase, which can interfere with topical atropine eye drops in some individuals. One drop each of 1% atropine and 10% phenylephrine, three to four times during a 15-minute period, has been recommended for rabbits (Kern, 1995) or 0.5 or 1% tropicamide can be used. The optic disc lies above the horizontal midline of the eye and it is necessary to look upward into the eye with an ophthalmoscope to view the optic disc, which has a deep natural depression (see Section 9.3). The retina is merangiotic (partially vascularized).",

Puberty occurs at 4-9 months (or when 70-75% of mature bodyweight is reached) with smaller breeds maturing earlier than larger breeds. Like the cat and the ferret, rabbits are induced ovulators. Although they do not show a regular oestrus cycle, they do vary in receptivity and a cyclic rhythm exists. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates ovarian follicles to develop and produce oestrogens that cause the female to be receptive. Follicular development occurs in waves with 5 to 10 follicles on each ovary being at the same stage of development at any one time. When the follicles reach maturity they produce oestrogen for about 12-14 days. If ovulation has not occurred during this period, the follicles degenerate with a corresponding reduction in oestrogen level and sexual receptivity. After about 4 days a new wave of follicles begins to produce oestrogen and the doe becomes receptive again. Many factors influence this cyclic rhythm including nutrition, light, temperature, sexual stimulation and individual variation. In general, the receptive period lasts 14-16 days with a period of non-receptivity for 1-2 days (Patton, 1994) . This is slightly longer than the oestrogen dominant phase, and a good rule of thumb is that a doe will usually be receptive while the vulva is red and swollen. Mating stimulates ovulation approximately 10 hours post-coitus (Harkness, 1987) . Ovulation can also be induced by proximity of an entire male, mechanical stimulation of the vagina or by the act of being mounted by another female. Some indiviuduals will continue to be sexually receptive throughout pregnancy, although superfoetation (maintenance of two pregnancies at different stages) does not occur.",

Does are fertile immediately after kindling, especially during the summer months. Breeders usually take females to the buck for mating rather than vice versa as they can be territorial and attack the buck if he is put in her hutch. Sometimes the two are introduced on neutral territory. In general, females are mated for the first time at approximately 5 months old and are not bred from over the age of 3 years (Sandford, 1996) . Mating takes place within a few minutes and can be accompanied by a scream from either party, which is deemed to be normal. in late pregnancy. Radiographically, pregnancy can be detected after the 11th day. Real-time ultrasound can be used for early pregnancy diagnosis, being reliable from day 8 onwards (Ypsilantis and Saratsis, 1999) . Some does remain sexually receptive during pregnancy and will continue to be mated by a male companion; however, superfoetation does not occur. Does can be mated soon after giving birth and may be lactating and pregnant at the same time. Gestation is maintained by progesterone that is produced exclusively by the ovarian corpora lutea. In the absence of fetuses, pseudopregnancy can occur after ovulation and is maintained by corpora lutea that degrade after approximately 17 days (Fekete and Huszenicza, 1993) . In the wild, unfavourable winter conditions or lack of food suppress follicular activity. Gestation takes 31-32 days, with litter sizes on average being five to eight; larger breeds generally have larger litters (Sandford, 1996) . It is possible for a doe to have six litters in a year and produce 40 to 50 offspring. During late pregnancy the doe may be seen carrying bedding material into her chosen nesting site. The nest is built from hay, straw or other bedding material. The quality of the nest varies between individual does and has a strong influence on the survival of the young. The doe will defend her chosen nesting site against potential intruders, especially if she is pregnant or lactating and can become aggressive towards owners, other rabbits or pets. Hair is pulled from the hip, dewlap and mammary glands to line the nest. She may consume less food at this point and should be tempted to eat, as pregnancy toxaemia is a risk during this period. Otherwise, the doe should be left undisturbed.",

The young are altricial and born bald, blind and helpless. Most passive immunity is obtained before birth, although some antibodies are present in the colostrum . When the entire litter has been born, the doe pulls more fur from her body to cover the litter in its nest. Does are particularly susceptible to disturbance in the first few days after parturition and may cannibalize the young. Inexperienced does sometimes mutilate them. The legs or ears may be attacked or the skin stripped over the neck, thorax or abdomen. Cannibalization and mutilation are most likely to take place on the day of parturition and may be an extension of eating the placenta. Sometimes young rabbits are born outside the nest or the doe rejects them. These kits will die from hypothermia unless they are warmed up and returned to the nest. The doe will usually accept them and the chances of survival are far greater if the kit is reared by its natural mother rather than being hand-reared by a human. It is advisable to remove other rabbits from the hutch during late pregnancy. Female companions can cannibalize the young and entire males will mate the doe within hours of her giving birth.

It is possible for baby rabbits to survive for more than 24-h intervals between feeds, which explains why females can rear litters that exceed their number of nipples (Lang, 1981b) . Suckling normally takes place in the early morning and, if the doe does return to the nest to feed the young for a second time, then it is usually in the first few days after giving birth. The baby rabbits spend most of the day buried in the warmest part of the nest, tightly grouped together conserving heat and energy. After about 22 h, the whole group becomes active and makes its way to the surface (McBride, 1988) . When the mother arrives, she stands over the babies which suckle, changing nipples and position approximately every 30 seconds. After about 3 minutes, the doe leaves the nest and the babies urinate on the surface before digging themselves deep into the bedding to sleep for another 22 h. Young rabbits are totally dependent on milk until day 10. They are usually eating small amounts of solid food by day 15 (Kraus et al., 1984) and start to leave the nest and be weaned at about 25 days of age.",

Constant interference and 'checking to see if they are alright' increases the likelihood of the mother cannibalizing the young in the first few days. There is also a misconception that all baby animals must be fed every 2-3 h, even during the night. If owners are concerned, the nest can be checked once a day and if the babies are warm, asleep and unwrinkled then they are being fed. Baby rabbits that are not being fed will be restless and crawling around on the surface of the nest. They take on a wrinkled appearance due to dehydration. It is possible to cross-foster orphaned rabbits to another lactating doe. It is not necessary to use any method for destroying the scent of the natural mother or human hand. Females do not make any distinction of young, even if they are of different colours or sizes (Cheeke et al., 1982) . Ideally, older rabbits should be introduced to a younger litter. The fostered babies should be placed at the bottom of the nest with the natural kits on top.",

Baby rabbits can be fed on powdered cat milk replacers; however, these are often less calorie dense, and much higher in carbohydrate than rabbit milk. Johnson-Delaney (1996a) advocated the addition of egg yolk to milk replacer (in this instance Esbilac) in order to increase the fat and protein levels. They will drink 2-30 mL of milk per feed, depending on how old they are. Baby rabbits should be fed when they are restless. Milk replacers are a nutritional compromise and do not match the composition of rabbit milk. Therefore orphan rabbits may need feeding two to three times daily, but care should be taken not to overfeed or force-feed them. Holding newborn rabbits on their backs simulates the natural nursing position. Hypothermic or moribund rabbits can be given fluids or milk replacers by stomach tube to correct hypoglycaemia. The babies should be kept warm and dry in a quiet place with suitable bedding material in which to burrow. Shredded tissue paper or kitchen roll is satisfactory for making a nest that can be put in a hay-lined cardboard box and placed in a warm environment such as an airing cupboard.",

A syringe with a teat or a small amount of tubing cut from a giving set is a satisfactory method of feeding orphans. Healthy babies suck the milk out of the syringe. Squirting milk into the mouth carries a risk of choking the rabbit. Enteritis is a potentially lethal complication of hand-rearing. Rabbits are unusual among young animals in having very few microorganisms in the stomach and small intestine while Rabbit Basic Science suckling (Lang, 1981b ). An antimicrobial fatty acid or 'milk oil' is present in the suckling rabbit. It is produced by an enzymatic reaction in the doe's milk that takes place in the suckling rabbit's stomach (Brooks, 1997) . This milk oil controls the gastrointestinal microbial contents of suckling rabbits and protects them from enteric infection. Orphan rabbits that are fed on milk from other species do not develop this antimicrobial factor and are therefore more susceptible to bacterial infections introduced during feeding. It is important that boiled water and sterile syringes and feeding tubes are used to feed orphans and that each feed is made up just prior to being given. Overfeeding can cause digestive upsets. In general, it is preferable to underfeed than overfeed. Small babies can soon make up their weight once they are weaned and able to digest solid food.",

Increasing day-length can trigger social, sexual and even aggressive actions in neutered rabbits, although the behaviour is usually mild. In the spring, does may dig out a new burrow and males may have minor skirmishes. Copulatory actions can persist after neutering, as part of dominance or excitement behaviour. It is beneficial for rabbits to be neutered for similar reasons to the dog or cat. Neutering prevents unwanted pregnancies and pseudopregnancies and permits both sexes to be housed together. Male aggression is reduced or abolished, so fight and bite wounds are minimized. Neutering also modifies scent marking by spraying urine or depositing faeces. Female reproductive disorders such as uterine or mammary neoplasia and endometritis occur frequently in the middle-aged doe. Spaying is indicated to prevent these diseases. Aggressive behaviour towards owners can be modified by neutering, especially if it is hormone related. Male rabbits make better pets if they are castrated. Entire bucks can attempt to mate their owner's legs or mount toys, mats or other household objects. Although rabbits can be spayed or castrated at any age, approximately 5 months of age is the best time for both sexes. It is advisable to spay females after puberty but before maturity when large amounts of abdominal fat can complicate the surgery. Prepubescent females can be more difficult to spay because of their tiny uterus and ovaries that can be hard to locate; however, the surgical incision can be very small, and if haemoclips or a ligasure device are used for haemostasis then surgery is extremely rapid. The benefits of a quick surgery, a small incision and less tissue manipulation must be weighed against the difficulty in visualizing the uterus. On a cautionary note, insufficient research has been done to allow certainty that early neutering will not cause adrenal disease in rabbits as it does in ferrets. Males should be left until the testicles have descended. Motile spermatozoa appear in the ejaculate from about 4 months of age. After castration, the male can be considered sterile after a period of 5-6 weeks.",

Those rabbits that are kept in gardens visited by wild rabbits are most at risk. Myxomatosis is a member of the poxvirus family and is almost universally fatal in unvaccinated rabbits. Outbreaks of myxomatosis occur seasonally, reaching their peak in the late summer. Historically in the UK a live vaccine (Nobivac Myxo) prepared from attenuated Shope fibroma virus grown on cell line culture has been used. Shope fibroma virus naturally affects the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus that is native to North America. It is antigenically related to myxoma virus and cross-immunity occurs. Shope fibroma virus is transmissible to the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus in which it produces localized benign fibromas. The disadvantage of this vaccine is that it is less immunogenic than attenuated myxoma virus vaccines, and the duration of immunity is short. With the introduction of a novel combined myxomatosis/viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) vaccine, this stand-alone myxomatosis vaccine is likely to be withdrawn from sale.

It is caused by a host-specific calicivirus (see Section 14.6.2). VHD virus is spread by oral, nasal and parenteral transmission and is present in urine and faeces from infected rabbits. The virus can survive for long periods outside the host. It is thought that wild birds carried infection across the channel from Europe to wild rabbits in this country. Wild hares form the wildlife reservoir in this country, carrying the virus without clinical effect. VHD may be transmitted directly from contact with wild rabbits and hares or carried on footwear and clothing. Contaminated foods, such as grass or weeds picked from areas grazed by wild rabbits, can be a source of infection. Hutches and cages that have been occupied by an infected rabbit require thorough disinfection before a new rabbit is introduced. Ideally, only vaccinated animals should be brought in to infected premises. VHD virus can survive outside the host for 10-19 months at room temperature. Exposure to 2% potassium peroxymonosulphate (Virkon) for 2 h does not inactivate the virus, although a 4% solution is effective; 1% sodium hydroxide or 10% household bleach is also an effective disinfectant (Goodly, 2001; Gorski et al., 1994) .",

Recombinant technology has allowed insertion of a capsid protein gene from the VHD virus into a laboratory-attenuated strain of myxomatosis, giving dual immunity. This vaccine has not been associated with adverse side effects, nor has it been shown to exacerbate underlying conditions. It is considered safe for use in both young and intensively farmed animals. Occasionally small local skin reactions (plaques of thickened skin without scabs) are noted at the site of injection (1-2 cm in diameter, around 1 week post-injection); however, these resolve without treatment within a few days. There is evidence that rabbits who have been previously vaccinated with a myxoma virus-derived vaccine or who have survived myxomatosis may demonstrate a lack of response to the VHD component of this vaccine. In the UK these cases are likely to be rare as myxoma-derived vaccines are not used; however, rabbits imported from Europe may be affected.

People that smell of other rabbits or animals can be attacked as part of defensive territorial behaviour. In general it is preferable to approach nervous or aggressive rabbits from above. As in other species, pain can result in aggressive behaviour. A rabbit that is normally docile but starts to be aggressive should be examined carefully for a source of pain.

Conditions such as digestive or respiratory tract disorders require more intensive nursing than many owners are willing or able to provide at home. As rabbits are good at hiding, illness and significant alterations in condition may pass unnoticed without regular knowledgeable observation. Medication in the form of intravenous fluids, daily injections or Rabbit Basic Science nebulization may be necessary. Regular syringe feeding, clipping and bathing may be required. Observation of behaviour, appetite, faecal and urine output is easier if the rabbit is kept on its own under the careful eye of competent nursing staff. A stress-free environment is required. Accommodation needs to be away from barking dogs and the sight and smell of predators. Ideally rabbits would be housed in a separate quiet room, where the nursing staff are able to spend time observing their patients as well as performing tasks such as assist feeding and medicating. Hospitalized rabbits should be provided with a bed of goodquality hay to nibble and lie on. The familiar smell of hay gives them security. All rabbits should be provided with some kind of hide, such as a cardboard box or short length of plastic drainpipe. House rabbits can be very particular in their choice of litter material and may be reluctant to use a tray that does not contain the correct type of litter. Most owners are willing to bring in the correct type of material for their rabbit's litter tray. Fresh water needs to be provided in a drinking container that the rabbit is familiar with. Some rabbits will not use a sipper bottle. It is worth considering hospitalizing a bonded companion of a sick rabbit as rabbits can become stressed if they are separated. The decision should be based on the welfare of the well rabbit, as hospitalization must be less stressful than separation.",

The traditional approach of an intravenous overdose of barbiturate can be difficult to accomplish easily in rabbits. The marginal ear vein is accessible but many rabbits will jump up suddenly in response to venepuncture, which can be distressing for owner, vet and rabbit. The application of a transdermal local anaesthetic cream (EMLA) may be sufficient to allow intravenous injection in very sick animals. Sedation prior to intravenous barbiturate injection is preferable if the owner wishes to be present. The owner may wait with their rabbit until the sedative has taken effect. A combination of acepromazine and butorphanol (0.5 mg/kg acepromazine plus 0.1 mg/kg butorphanol) can be given by subcutaneous injection and has the advantage of vasodilation that facilitates venepuncture. Alternatively, fentanyl/fluanisone (0.3-0.5 mL/kg) (Hypnorm, Janssen) can be used but it is given by intramuscular injection, which is more distressing to patient and owner than a subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous (50 mg/kg) ketamine with or without other agents can be used. Medetomidine is an effective sedative but causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which can make the lethal intravenous barbiturate injection difficult.

The jugular vein can usually be visualized in the jugular furrow and is raised by occluding the vessel by a finger at the thoracic inlet. Up to 10 mL of blood can be safely collected from any sized rabbit from this site. Difficulties can arise with short-nosed breeds such as the Netherland dwarf or animals with upper respiratory tract problems that can become distressed or even cyanosed when the head is extended backwards. Alternative sites such as the cephalic or lateral saphenous veins can be used instead. The lateral saphenous vein is more easily accessible and is often a larger size than the cephalic vein. The vessel is very superficial and collapses easily if too much negative pressure is applied. Large haematomas can occur if adequate pressure is not applied after the blood sample has been taken. It is a good idea to make a blood film in addition to placing the blood in sample tubes.

The rabbit should be wrapped in a towel, placed on the edge of a table and held by an assistant. The head is raised and held back, either by the assistant or by the person collecting the blood. It is important to ensure that the head is held straight. The fur over the jugular furrow is clipped off. Usually, the vein is easily visualized and can be raised by placing a finger at the thoracic inlet. A good-quality sample of 5-10 mL of blood can be collected quickly from this site without either haemolysis or clotting. Intravenous fluid therapy. A simple method of venepuncture for intravenous fluid therapy is to use a 21-or 23-gauge butterfly catheter (see Section 1.10.4.2). One wing is removed before inserting the needle, bevel up, into the marginal ear vein (caudal auricular vein). The remaining wing is 'superglued' to the fur on the ear after the needle has been inserted into the vein. The wing provides a large surface area of contact with the ear. In sedated or moribund rabbits, no bandaging is necessary to keep the needle in place, although a piece of bandage tied around the rabbit's neck can be used to hold the giving set out of the way. An intravenous catheter may be used instead of the butterfly set, but is not as satisfactory because the wing does not have as large a surface area for the bonding agent. Alternative sites for intravenous fluid therapy are the cephalic and saphenous veins. Intraosseous fluid therapy. In all intraosseous sites, a spinal needle is preferable because the stylet prevents bone clogging the needle. A spinal needle is stronger and more able to penetrate the bone. Possible sites for intraosseous administration: 1. Proximal humerus: this is the easiest site for access to a medullary cavity. An imaginary straight line is made using the greater trochanter of the humerus and the elbow joint as landmarks. The needle is inserted through the greater trochanter and directed along the imaginary line to penetrate into the medullary cavity. 2. Tibial crest: an intraosseous catheter can be inserted just caudoproximal to the tibial crest. However, the lateral wall of the tibial cortex curves medially and the needle must be directed towards the medial aspect of the tibia in order to penetrate the medullary cavity. If the needle is mistakenly inserted along an imaginary straight line towards the hock joint, it will go into the cortex of the tibia and miss the medullary cavity. 3. Proximal femur: this is the least satisfactory site for intraosseous fluid therapy because of the well-developed trochanteric fossa. This can be seen on the caudal view of the femur. The path of an intraosseous catheter must pass through this fossa to gain access to the medullary cavity. Therefore, to gain access to the medullary cavity three layers of cortical bone must be penetrated. 4. Difficult-to-groom areas. The areas of skin that are difficult for a rabbit to reach and groom are shown as green shading. Obesity or other flexibility problems hinder grooming in these areas and allow dead hair, skin debris and parasites to accumulate. Signs of skin disease often begin at these sites. The area between the tail and the dorsum can become contaminated by urine, faeces and is often the site that flies choose to lay their eggs. These are the areas that owners should pay particular attention to when grooming their pet.",

            "text": "This route introduces fluids and drugs into the medullary cavity of long bones so they are absorbed into the venous circulation. Anything that can be administered intravenously can be given intraosseously. There are several advantages to this technique, which avoids the necessity of cannulating a small collapsed vein in moribund patients. The intraosseous route is often used for small exotic animal patients such as birds, reptiles, guinea pigs and pot-bellied pigs where it is difficult to find a peripheral vein. Most rabbits are large enough and have sufficient accessible veins to use the intravenous route but there are occasions when intraosseous administration of drugs and especially fluids can be life-saving. Some practitioners prefer this method of fluid administration and use it routinely. Disadvantages include the risk of introducing infection and causing osteomyelitis. The rate of administration can be slow. These problems can be overcome by using careful aseptic techniques and multiple sites. Immature bones with active growth plates and diseased or fractured bones are not suitable. A needle is used to bore a hole through a bony prominence into the marrow cavity. Direct penetration of the marrow cavity is easier in the tibia or humerus of the rabbit than the femur. The anatomy of the head of the femur requires penetration of the trochanteric fossa so the cortical bone is penetrated three times instead of once (see Figure 1 .19). The humerus is the preferred site. In conscious animals, local anaesthetic is infiltrated around the injection site, which is clipped and aseptically prepared prior to the introduction of the needle. A 20-to 22-gauge needle that is about half the length of the bone is required, i.e., 4-6 cm (1.5-2.5 in.). Spinal needles with a stylet that prevents a plug of bone clogging up the bore are most suitable but ordinary hypodermic needles can be used with a smaller gauge needle, catheter stylet or a length of wire acting as the stylet. The bone is penetrated by using the needle as a drill. The needle should be kept straight when boring the hole in the bone; this is easier to achieve if the needle is attached to a syringe that is then used as a handle. Moving the needle from side to side results in a larger hole than is required and leakage of fluid around the injection site. Penetration of the cortex can be felt as a sudden lack of resistance. The needle may need to be redirected slightly to push it down the medullary cavity. It is important to be certain that the tip of the needle is in the medullary cavity and not pushed against or penetrating the cortex. At this point the stylet is removed and a syringe attached to the needle to aspirate bone marrow which confirms correct placement of the needle. If there is any doubt, radiography is indicated. If the needle is not placed correctly, it should be withdrawn and a different bone selected to attempt the procedure again. Once the needle is placed it can be glued or sutured in place. Dressings and antiseptics can be used for protection and to reduce the likelihood of infection. Heparin should be introduced into the catheter every 4-6 h. The needle should not be left in place for longer than 72 h. When it is removed a light dressing and some antiseptic can be applied to the site (Anderson, 1995) .",

A readily available source of carbohydrate is required to provide glucose for absorption from the stomach and small intestine and prevent hypoglycaemia and the mobilization of the free fatty acids. In the long term, indigestible fibre and fermentable fibre are required to maintain gut motility and optimal conditions in the caecum for bacterial fermentation. Although fermentable fibre can be administered through a syringe, it is not possible to provide indigestible fibre in this way because it has to be ground down to a fine powder in order to pass through the nozzle. The beneficial effect of long indigestible fibre particles is lost by being ground down to a size smaller than 0.5 mm because particles below this size are moved back into the caecum to undergo bacterial fermentation rather than passing into the colon and stimulating gut motility.

This technique should be used as a last resort because nasogastric tubes stress rabbits and stress reduces gastrointestinal motility and impairs digestive function. An Elizabethan collar is required to prevent a rabbit removing a nasogastric tube and this is not only stress provoking but also prevents caecotrophy. In most cases, syringe feeding is satisfactory and nasogastric tubes can be avoided.",

In the conscious animal, local anaesthetic can be sprayed (Intubeze, Arnolds) or dropped (Opthaine, Ciba) into the nostril. Sufficient time (2-3 minutes) should be allowed to elapse for the anaesthetic to take effect before the tube is introduced. Paediatric tubes (4-8 French) are suitable for this purpose or customized veterinary products are available in varying sizes (Cook Veterinary Products). The tube is measured against the rabbit and marked to give an idea of the position of the tip as the tube is being placed: 3FR-4F urinary catheters can be used if a nasogastric tube is not available but holes need to be cut in the side and these can catch on the nasal mucosa as the tube is introduced. To place a nasogastric tube, the rabbit's head is grasped and elevated and the tube introduced into the ventral meatus and directed slightly ventrally (see Figure 1 .20). The head is then flexed as the tube passes through the nasopharynx into the oesophagus and down into the stomach. Occasionally resistance is encountered in the nasal passage due to an elongated tooth root. In this instance, the other nostril can be tried.",

If in doubt, a radiograph can be taken to check the tube's position. The nasal end is secured to the skin of the nose and between the ears using tape butterflies and sutures or superglue. Alternatively it can be secured to the Elizabethan collar, which is required to prevent the rabbit removing or damaging the tube. Nasogastric tubes can be left in place for several days.

A technique for placing a pharyngotomy tube has been described for laboratory rabbits (Rogers et al., 1988) . Under general anaesthesia a 1cm incision is made 5 mm from the midline just anterior to the larynx on the left-hand side. A tube is passed through the oral cavity into the oesophagus and down to the stomach. The tube is grasped with artery forceps through the mouth and pushed against the wall of the pharynx to cause a bulge under-theskin incision. The muscle overlying the bulge is carefully incised using the hard tip of the artery forceps in the pharynx as a guide. The pharyngeal wall is incised and the oral end of the stomach tube exteriorized through the incision. The tube is then anchored at the pharyngeal incision before being run through the subcutaneous tissues to emerge at the base of the ear where it is anchored with skin sutures. Pharyngotomy tubes placed in this manner have been left in laboratory rabbits for 6-12 months to ensure accurate doses of the drugs that were being tested. The catheters were well tolerated and the rabbits continued to eat and drink without losing weight. This technique could be applied to pet rabbits. Soft feeding tubes designed for oesophagostomy in cats (Cook Veterinary Products) would be suitable for this purpose.",

In order to have a good endoscopic view, the stomach should be empty, which is difficult to achieve in rabbits even if they are prevented from eating caecotrophs.

There are circumstances when collars need to be fitted to rabbits but there are serious disadvantages. Rabbits fitted with Elizabethan collars can become depressed or even anorexic. The collars are stressful and are most likely to be fitted at a time when it is important to minimize stress levels such as after surgery or during periods of anorexia. Significant elevations in plasma glucose levels have been found in rabbits fitted with collars (Knudtzon, 1988) . Elizabethan collars also prevent a rabbit from consuming caecotrophs. Caecotrophs are rich in amino acids and vitamins and necessary for optimum nutrition and wound healing. Collar edges also damage the external pinnae of all but the shortest-eared rabbits, and this can contribute to discomfort. Good surgical technique, buried subcuticular sutures and the correct choice of suture material reduces the need for Elizabethan collars postoperatively. If collars are deemed necessary, then padding the edges to avoid ear damage, having supervised periods without the collar to allow caecotrophy and considering the use of clear collars to maintain field of vision can be helpful. For some areas (for example, to dewlap or rostral third of the body) soft collars are suitable for preventing self-trauma.",
