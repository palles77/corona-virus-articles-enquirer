Other causes of acute cough, such as pneumonia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and allergy, should be considered. 3. The best available evidence suggests that antibiotics may reduce symptoms and illness duration slightly. Costs and side effects make the benefit-harm trade off tenuous at best. 4. Neither age nor smoking status has been linked to antibiotic effectiveness. 5. Only doxycycline, erythromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole have been tested in positively reported randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); hence, these are the only antibiotics that should be considered.",

She remembers feeling a scratchy throat, which progressed to sore throat, general malaise, and cough. The cough has been bothersome both during the day and at night. It has kept her awake and has awakened her out of sleep. During the past week, she has coughed up phlegm. At first, it was clear to white. Now it is green or brown. There has been no blood. She felt alternately \"slightly feverish\" and \"chilly\" during the first few days of this illness but denies high temperatures and has not felt feverish for the past several days. She denies nasal symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, and vomiting. She may have had some increased dyspnea on exertion, especially in the beginning of the illness. She denies sensations of maxillary pain or postnasal drip. Her sore throat has resolved. This acute illness has caused her to reduce smoking to \"a few cigarettes a day.\" She notes that \"I really should quit that stuff.\" She has been using an over-the-counter combination cold formula, which she believes has helped manage the cough, although it does make her \"a bit groggy.\"",

Her heartburn is now well controlled with lifestyle modifications and ranitidine (Zantac), 150 mg once or twice daily. Routine health screenings revealed tobacco use (one pack per day for 30 years) and hyperlipidemia, which is now well controlled on a statin. She also takes a daily aspirin for heart attack and stroke prevention. Her blood pressure has ranged from normal to borderline. Random blood glucose screening was normal. She has had two urinary tract infections since coming to you, both of which resolved with fluids and short courses of antibiotics. With motivational counseling, she reduced her cigarette consumption to less than half a pack per day, has improved her diet, and walks a brisk mile several days per week. Mammograms, Pap smears, and a screening sigmoidoscopy have all been negative. Jane received all recommended childhood immunizations but has declined influenza vaccination.

Side effects of antibiotics, such as nausea, diarrhea, vaginal candidiasis, and allergic reaction, occur frequently with most antibiotics. When using antibiotics for acute bronchitis, the number needed to treat (Walter, 2001) and the number needed to harm are similar and in the range of 10 to 20 (Anonymous, 1998 (Cantrell et al., 2002\u2022 B ; Walter, 2001; Stone et al., 2000 \u2022 B ) .

However, with the definite possibility of specific effectiveness (Parvez, 1998 \u2022 A ) and with evidence suggesting that the placebo effect for cough treatments is substantial (Eccles, 2002; Lee et al., 1992 \u2022 B ), the use of over-the-counter dextromethorphan-containing formulations and/or limited use of prescription codeine or hydrocodone may be reasonable. Although benzonatate (Tessalon) has been approved as a prescription cough medicine, there is virtually no evidence for or against its effectiveness. Furthermore, the number and quality of RCTs on beta agonist (e.g., albuterol inhaler) used in the setting of acute bronchitis are limited.",

However, evidence from trials for common cold and in the setting of chronic lung disease suggests possible benefits and little harm (Anonymous, 2002a \u2022 A ; Schroeder and Fahey, 2004\u2022 A ; Smith and Feldman, 1993 \u2022 A ). Neither antihistamines nor decongestants have been shown to be helpful for bronchitis, and both carry risks. Antihistamines can cause drowsiness, which may lead to a motor vehicle accident. Decongestants are contraindicated in the settings of hypertension and heart disease. For children, there is no evidence of any benefit of any over-the-counter medicine for colds or bronchitis and reasonable evidence of potential harm (Anonymous, 2002a\u2022 A ; Gunn et al., 2001; Schroeder and Fahey, 2004 \u2022 A ). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help if pain is present. However, the widespread use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is associated with major morbidity and mortality, with more than 10,000 Americans dying each year, mostly from gastrointestinal bleeding, but also from congestive heart failure and renal failure (Fries, 1991\u2022 B ; Heerdink et al., 1998\u2022 B ; Page and Henry, 2000; Wolfe et al., 1999 \u2022 B ) . Although the effectiveness of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs appears similar, risks vary, with ibuprofen being among the safest. Acetaminophen, not a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is even safer.",

The first job of the clinician is to rule out other causes, such as pneumonia, asthma, bacterial sinusitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Once the diagnosis of acute infectious bronchitis is reached, the clinician's task turns to supporting the patient, in terms of both reassurance and selection of therapy. In most cases, antibiotics should be avoided. Until and unless better evidence emerges, the use of over-the-counter and prescription antitussives can be cautiously supported in adults. Decongestants should be avoided, especially if hypertension or heart disease is present. Beta-agonist inhalers may help those with wheezing or a history of asthma. Supportive home treatments, such as fluids, rest, and avoidance of stressors, make good sense but are largely unsupported by evidence. Unless symptoms dramatically worsen, most patients with acute bronchitis do not need a return visit. ",
