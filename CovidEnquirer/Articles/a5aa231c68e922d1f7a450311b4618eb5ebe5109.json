            "text": "The objectives were to separate canine seminal plasma proteins (with SDS-PAGE) and to determine the correlation between specific proteins and semen characteristics. Three ejaculates from 20 mixed-breed dogs, of unknown fertility, were collected by digital manipulation. Ejaculate volume and color, sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa, and membrane integrity (hypoosmotic swelling test and fluorescent staining) were assessed. For each dog, seminal plasma was pooled from all three ejaculates and proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE, using polyacrylamide concentrations of 13% and 22% in the separation gels. After staining, gel images were digitized to estimate molecular weights (MW) and integrated optical density (IOD) of each lane and of individual bands. Total seminal plasma protein concentration was 2.19 AE 1.56 g/dL (mean AE SD; range 1.12-5.19 g/dL). A total of 37 protein bands were identified (although no dog had all 37 bands). In the 13% gel, molecular weights ranged from 100.6 to 17.1 kDa, with four bands (49.7, 33.2, 26.4, and 19.5 kDa) present in samples from all dogs. In the 22% gel, molecular weights ranged from 15.6 to 3.6 kDa, with nine bands (15.6, 13.5, 12.7, 11.7, 10.5, 8.7, 7.8, 5.6, and 4.9 kDa) present in samples from all dogs. Combined for both gels, the majority of bands (85%) had molecular weights <17 kDa, with B20 (15.6 kDa) in high concentrations in samples from all dogs. There were positive correlations (P 0.01) between two bands, B4 (67 kDa) and B5 (58.6 kDa), and sperm motility (r = 0.66 and r = 0.46), sperm vigor (r = 0.56 and r = 0.66), percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa (r = 0.55 and r = 0.59), the hypoosmotic swelling test (r = 0.76 and r = 0.68), and fluorescent staining (r = 0.56 and r = 0.59), respectively. In conclusion, 37 proteins were identified in seminal plasma; two were significantly correlated with semen characteristics. #",

            "text": "In recent years, many seminal plasma proteins have been identified and characterized [1] [2] [3] ; several have been associated with fertility in various species [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Four seminal plasma proteins associated with bull fertility were identified with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [5] . Two of these proteins, 26 kDa (pI 6.2) and 55 kDa (pI 4.5), were associated with high-fertility bulls, whereas the other two, 16 kDa (pI 4.1 and 6.7, respectively), were more frequent in low-fertility bulls. Based on the four fertility-associated proteins in seminal plasma, a regression model that provided the www.theriojournal.com Theriogenology 68 (2007) 100-106 best empirical prediction of fertility was developed. Estimated fertility values, based on four proteins, were compared to actual in vivo bull fertility; there was a positive association (r = 0.89), indicating that the predictive model was valid. In subsequent studies, the 55 kDa (pI 4.5) bovine seminal plasma protein was identified as an osteopontin [10] and the 26 kDa (pI 6.2) protein as a lipocalin-type prostaglandin-D synthase [11] . In another study, a seminal plasma ribonuclease (14 kDa) was present in higher concentrations in bulls with poor post-thaw semen quality [12] . In stallions, SP-1 (72 kDa, pI 5.6), a seminal plasma protein was positively correlated with fertility, whereas SP-2 (75 kDa, pI 6.0), SP-3 (18 kDa, pI 4.3), and SP-4 (16 kDa, pI 6.5) were negatively correlated with fertility. Based on Western blot analysis, there was a similarity between SP-1 and the bovine protein (55 kDa, pI 4.5) previously described [8] .",

Furthermore, canine arginine esterase has considerable homology to a family of heparin-binding proteins from equine seminal plasma (SSPs-7) [35] . We have investigated the affinity by [36] . The current data provided additional evidence that band B20 is a canine arginine esterase subunit; however, that requires confirmation with other methods. There was no significant correlation between total protein concentration and semen characteristics, in contrast with previous reports in other species [37] [38] [39] [40] . It is noteworthy that this is the first study in dogs to correlate protein band densitometry to semen characteristics. Sperm motility, as well as other semen characteristics, were correlated to the IOD of two bands (B4 and B5, 67 and 58.6 kDa). Similarly, in stallions, there was a linear correlation between motility of both fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa and the relative concentration of two protein bands (19.6 and 15.3 kDa) [41] . Furthermore, Killian et al. [5] reported that differences in nonreturn rates of reproductively normal bulls were correlated with the amounts of four proteins in seminal plasma. Moreover, in previous studies we showed the $58.6 kDa band to be a heparin-binding protein [36] . Thus, since motility and other seminal characteristics are correlated to in vitro and in vivo fertility in dogs [20, 42] , the proteins identified in the present study may be valuable markers for fertility.",

In addition, more sophisticated studies that allow higher-resolution separation of seminal plasma proteins and more detailed characterization of those proteins, as well as investigation of their physiological role, will further advance knowledge in this area.",
