Mandarin is also the official language in Taiwan. The Facebook post was then updated a day later to clarify that they welcome patrons from Taiwan, despite 16 Taiwanese people confirmed to have 2019-nCoV, as of Feb 8, 2020. 3 This anti-Chinese sentiment can be traced back to the general public's discontent with the Hong Kong Government's declining autonomy due to Beijing tightening up its control over the territory, and it was exacerbated by the government's delayed public health response, which fell behind Macau, the other SAR of China, in handling the 2019-nCoV crisis. 4 As a result, some of the public health precautionary strategies are selfinitiated by the community in attempts to influence the government's policies; for instance, health-care staff held a strike to press for a total border closure, which the government was reluctant to endorse. However, we should be cautious about the possibility that public health measures, however well intended, can be tainted by sentiment that is fuelled with prejudice against a certain group of people. If left unexamined, this sentiment could give rise to measures that do not target the real issue accurately and adequately, undermining the effectiveness of any interventions.",

Moreover, it can be argued that bias against a certain group of people on the basis of a limited set of probable confounded factors might lead to shame, stress, and stigma that prevent true carriers from reporting their condition to official bodies and receiving timely health-care attention. people has become widespread in Japan. #ChineseDon'tComeToJapan is trending on Twitter, and Chinese visitors have been tagged as dirty, insensitive, and even bioterrorists. 7 The magnitude of the 2019-nCoV outbreak remains unclear. Estimating the reproduction number and capturing the transmission dynamics are crucial to considering effective countermeasures. Considering that asymptomatic cases in Japan were detected among those who flew back from Wuhan by a Japanese chartered plane, 1 the risk of infection during the pre-symptomatic period needs to be investigated.",

One example is Kwong Wing Catering, a pro-movement restaurant chain, which in a Facebook announcement on Jan 28, 2020, said it would only serve English or Cantonesespeaking but not Mandarin-speaking customers as a public health measure. 2 The Facebook post garnered the third most supportive reactions and interactions since the Facebook page's inception in September, 2019. Although the three languages are officially recognised in the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, view of the current situation, to reduce cross-infection, many hospitals have cancelled outpatient appointments (except for emergency and fever clinics). This inevitably affects the diagnosis and treatment of patients with other diseases.",
