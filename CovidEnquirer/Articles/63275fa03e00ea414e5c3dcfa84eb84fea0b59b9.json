Within the framework of the national acute respiratory illness surveillance, the Ministry of Health in the Sultanate of Oman has announced two confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to date. The aim of this report is to describe the epidemiological aspects of these two cases and to highlight the importance of public health preparedness and response. The absence of secondary cases among contacts of the reported cases can be seen as evidence of the effectiveness of infection prevention and control precautions as an important pillar of the national preparedness and response plan applied in the health care institutions in Oman. strengthening five pillars of action, including public health surveillance and contact management, building laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control, case management, and risk communication. Algorithms were developed describing response actions in the event of a suspected MERS-CoV case. Checklists for the preparedness of health care facilities were developed and action plans were later developed to rectify the deficiencies. Field visits were conducted immediately after confirmation of cases by the regional and national rapid response teams from the Ministry of Health, and contact surveillance and monitoring was conducted for 14 days after the last exposure. Laboratory surveillance for MERS-CoV started by building laboratory diagnostic capacity with the availability of the primers for MERS-CoV testing, and with the training of laboratory personnel countrywide on the triple-packing and shipment of samples. Training on how to collect nasopharyngeal swabs for testing for MERS-CoV was conducted for emergency room physicians, internists, and intensivists in all district hospitals.",
