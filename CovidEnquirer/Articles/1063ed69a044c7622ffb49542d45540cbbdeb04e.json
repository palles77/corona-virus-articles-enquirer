Four twisted wind profiles with different magnitudes and directions of yaw angles were employed to investigate variations in wind speed with the properties of the twisted wind flows at the pedestrian level. An additional conventional wind profile with similar wind speeds and turbulence intensities to the twisted winds but with zero yaw angles was simulated for comparisons. The mean wind speeds at 77 locations including the perimeter, roadsides, and groups of highrise buildings were analysed for the conventional and the four twisted wind flows. The comparisons show a tendency of twisted winds to generate higher wind speeds at the pedestrian level than the conventional wind profile. The wind speeds of the twisted winds have a strong dependence on the magnitude and direction of the yaw angles, particularly at locations where the densities of buildings in the neighbourhood are low and hence local wind circulations are significantly modified by the twisted winds.",

            "text": "The properties of an approaching wind such as its wind speed, turbulence intensity, and direction are important for evaluating the pedestrian-level wind (PLW) field in an urban area. For example, when a wind flow with high ambient speed strikes a building, it tends to generate windy areas around it near the ground, causing discomfort to pedestrians [1] . Highly intense turbulence, on the other hand, has its advantages: for example, it increases the velocity of the horizontal wind component near the roof of a building, strengthening the street-canyon vortex, facilitating the removal of air pollutants from a street canyon [2] . Kastner-Klein and Plate [3] have demonstrated how pollutant concentration in a street canyon decreases with a change in wind direction from the perpendicular to the oblique and concluded that the effects of wind direction are of practical concern. Given that the properties of the approaching wind are important in assessing the wind environment in a built-up area, researchers have devoted significant time and effort on simulating the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind flows in a boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) [4] [5] [6] and on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Particularly in an urban area, the accuracy of empirical models becomes low because of the complex morphology. For instance, the shape of the power-law wind model can become distorted because of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect [11] and the development of an internal boundary layer [12] . Similarly, the assumption of the constant wind direction along the profiles' height is doubtful in the urban wind field [13, 14] . Compared to wind speed and turbulence, the variation in wind directions has not received much attention even though several researchers, such as Kikumoto et al. [14] have emphasised that the deviation in wind directions should be replicated accurately in both physical and numerical simulations to obtain precise results when studying urban wind fields.",

            "text": "The vertical variation in wind directions is a topic that has been insensitively studied in the field of yacht sail's aerodynamic [15] [16] [17] . Conversely, directional variations in a wind flow have not been systematically investigated in the field of wind engineering until very recent when Tse et al. [18] [19] [20] conducted a series of wind tunnel tests using twisted wind profiles. Tse et al. [18] first simulated twisted wind profiles, which have varying wind directions along the profile's height, in a BLWT and then used them for the wind tunnel tests to show the ways that twisted wind flows modify the PLW field near isolated buildings and arrays of buildings [19, 20] . Although these wind tunnel tests are indicative of the impact of twisted winds on the PLW field near generic buildings, it is not yet fully understood whether twisted wind profiles have similar importance in assessing the PLW field in an urban area. This uncertainty arises from the inherited characteristics of an urban area, including its inhomogeneous land use, irregular building arrangement, and non-uniform dimensions, shapes, and forms of buildings; all of them are vastly different from the generic buildings that were previously tested in twisted wind flows. Therefore, it is a timely need to conduct a comprehensive study on the urban PLW field under the influence of twisted winds to expand the existing knowledge. Moreover, such a study would be beneficial in fine-tuning the testing procedures of the urban PLW field such as the Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA) [21] .",

The vertical variation in flow directions is a result of the combined effects of Earth's rotation, friction between the wind and Earth's surface, and the pressure gradient force between high-and low-pressure zones [13] . The resulting wind profile is shaped like a spiral commonly known as the Ekman Spiral. The variation in wind direction within the Ekman Spiral is about 20\u00b0on average but can vary from 10\u00b0to 30\u00b0between the heights in the range of 1-1.5 km in the ABL [25] . However, deviations in wind direction observed in field measurement campaigns are larger than the average deviation in wind direction of the Ekman Spiral and are confined to the lower altitudes in the ABL (as opposed to all along its height). For example, Wind-Lidar measurements taken by Pe\u00f1a et al. [13] reveal 25\u00b0-45\u00b0deviations in wind direction under the neutral and stable atmospheric conditions while Kikumoto et al. [14] report about 70\u00b0of the deviations in wind direction for the heights in between 67.5 m and 500 m from SODAR-Lidar measurements.",

            "text": "There is no field measurement campaign ever conducted in Hong Kong to verify the existence of twisted wind profiles nevertheless almost every topographical wind tunnel tests conducted in Hong Kong affirm the twisted wind profiles' existence. Since the topographical wind tunnel tests reproduce the field conditions under neutral atmospheric stability, it is reasonable to assume that the twisted wind profiles very likely exist in Hong Kong. In fact, Tse et al. [18] confirmed the existence of twisted wind profiles in Hong Kong by analysing 256 wind profiles obtained from topographical wind tunnel tests. Their analysis reveals that the absolute difference in wind directions between the full-scale measurement heights of 25 m and 500 m can be as large as 40\u00b0i rrespective to wind speeds, in which the yaw angles were measured. Apparently, the wind directional deviations observed from the wind tunnel tests are smaller than those reported by Pe\u00f1a et al. [13] and Kikumoto et al. [14] . Nevertheless, the deviation can still be considered as significant when considering that its magnitude is larger than that of the Ekman Spiral and the deviation is confined to the lower 500 m of the ABL. Based on the results of the wind tunnel tests and CFD simulations carried out by Weerasuriya et al. [26] and Li et al. [27] , Tse et al. [18] conjecture that the hilly terrain of Hong Kong may generate large wind direction deviations in the lower part of the ABL. Consequently, the influence of the hilly terrain on the wind direction field should be included in the evaluation of the PLW field in Hong Kong for finding solutions for many wind-related issues, including outdoor thermal discomfort [28] , degradation of air quality [29] , increase of UHI effect [30] , and favourable conditions for spreading airborne pathogens such as the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus [31] . Although the twisted wind profiles observed in Hong Kong are dependent of the underlying hilly terrain, atmospheric stability conditions, in particular, the stable atmospheric stability, can alter the properties of topography-induced twisted wind profiles such as the magnitude of yaw angle [32] .",

The wind tunnel in the WWTF is a closed-return type BLWT, which has two test sections, referred to as the high-speed section (maximum operating wind speed is 25 m s \u22121 ) and the low-speed section (maximum operating wind speed is 10 m s \u22121 ) according to their operating wind speeds. The wind tunnel tests in this study were conducted in the low-speed section because of its large dimensions (5 m in width and 4 m in height) under its maximum operating wind speed of 10 m s \u22121 at 1 m height. The large dimensions of the test section are advantageous for simulating twisted wind profiles because flow reflections from the sidewalls of the wind tunnel are of a considerable concern. Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup arranged in the low-speed section of the wind tunnel. A wooden vane system, which had 5 individual vanes as shown in Fig. 2 , was installed 4 m upstream from the centre of the turntable to generate twisted wind flows. Each vane was 1.5 m tall and was fabricated using laminated wooden strips. The maximum guide angles of the vane systems were 15\u00b0and 30\u00b0, and strips were rotated in either clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b). In other words, there were four types of vanes employed to simulate twisted wind profiles in this study. The previous publications of the authors [18] [19] [20] provide more details of the vane system.",

At each point, mean wind speeds, turbulence intensities, and yaw angles were measured at 12 discrete heights from 10 mm to 1000 mm for a sampling period of 65 s. The sampling period is representative of over a 7-h field measurement period according to the linear scale of 1:400 and velocity scale of 1:1.

            "text": "The wind speed profiles were fairly consistent at the five test locations with an average difference in wind speeds of about 2%-5% at the lowest measurement height of 10 mm. The measured wind speed at downstream test point E in certain cases can be 6-15% higher than those measured at the centre of the turntable. The higher wind speeds may be related to low turbulence intensity recorded at the test point E, where the largest deviation in turbulence intensity was observed. Compared with wind speed and turbulence intensity, yaw angles present noticeable variations in both longitudinal and lateral directions; more specifically, the magnitude of yaw angle decreased by 20%-30% from the upstream test point C to the downstream test point E. The variation in yaw angles in the lateral direction was dependent on the direction of the approaching wind near ground, such that the test point D had larger yaw angles in clockwise twisted wind flows, while the test point B recorded larger yaw angles in counter-clockwise twisted winds. Similar results have been reported by Flay [15] and Tse et al. [18] and suggest that varying flow properties are an inherent characteristic of twisted wind profiles simulated in a BLWT. Fig. 4 (a) shows the profiles of mean wind speed and turbulence intensity in the four twisted wind profiles and the conventional wind profile (labelled as CWP) as measured at the centre of the turntable. The conventional wind profile, which was a common wind profile without any wind directional deviation, had wind speed and turbulence intensity similar to the twisted wind profiles and followed the power-law type wind profile model with an exponent of 0.11. All wind profiles had a wind speed of about 7.9 ms-1 and turbulence intensity about 5.7% at 600 mm height. As shown in Fig. 4(b) , both the vanes with clockwise and counter-clockwise maximum guide angles of 15\u00b0generated a maximum yaw angle of 13\u00b0, while the vanes with the maximum guide angle of 30\u00b0produced a maximum yaw angle of 22\u00b0at 10 mm height. Based on their respective maximum yaw angle and its direction, the four twisted wind profiles are hereafter referred to as TWP13-CW, TWP22-CW, TWP13-ACW, and TWP22-ACW, where the abbreviations CW and ACW stand for \"clockwise\" and \"counter-clockwise\", for the yaw angles.",

In each wind flow, the urban model was tested for 36 wind directions from 0\u00b0(north) to 350\u00b0a t an interval of 10\u00b0.

Two directions, 60\u00b0and 120\u00b0that are parallel to the two roads, are selected because of their significance in the evaluation of the PLW field. The mountain Tai Mo Shan located at 60\u00b0could be a source of twisted winds that are frequently found at the site and 120\u00b0is a prevailing wind direction with a high probability of occurrence of winds at the site according to the long-term measurements of wind speed in Hong Kong [38] .

The K values at the leeward end are 36-62% smaller, creating LWS condition, than their corresponding values at the windward end, which has acceptable wind conditions for all wind flows. Among the five wind flows, TWP13-CW and TWP22-CW have larger deficits in K values of 58.8% and 61.8% at the two ends of the road compared to the 41.3% deficit for CWP. The deficit of K value is a result of the loss of momentum of winds due to the friction between winds and rough surfaces along the road while the dissimilar deficits may be attributed to the differences in wind-structure interactions of the conventional and twisted wind flows along Yeung Uk Road.",

The difference in K value varies considerably with the yaw direction of the oncoming winds, for example, while TWP13-ACW and TWP22-ACW have larger differences of 136% and 244%, TWP13-CW and TWP22-CW only register 66% and 88% differences between the K values at the two ends.

Three test points 71, 73, and 8 are selected for the detailed analysis of three distinct wind conditions that are anticipated occurring upstream/downstream (depending on wind directions) of the buildings, in a passage between two high-rise buildings, and in a deep street canyon next to the buildings. The wind rose diagram in Fig. 11(a) shows two distinct peaks in K values at 0\u00b0and 190\u00b0. For these two directions, test point 71 can be considered as located either upstream or downstream of the group of high-rise buildings. When test point 71 is in the upstream direction, all wind flows record their maximum K values. For instance, CWP has its maximum K value of 0.32 at 190\u00b0and the four twisted winds record their maximum K values of 0.31-0.32 in directions ranging from 180\u00b0to 200\u00b0. These maximum K values of the wind flows at test point 71 may be attributed to the intense backflow generated by the high-rise buildings when the buildings are exposed to winds that approach from directions 180\u00b0to 200\u00b0. Then the variation of \u03c6 Kmax (i.e., the wind direction of the maximum K value) may be related to the modifications of upstream flow features by the twisted winds as discussed by Tse et al. [20] . The second peak in K value, which is marginally less than 0.3, is found at 0\u00b0, for which the location of test point 71 is downstream of the group of high-rise buildings. When test point 71 is in the downstream direction, it may be subjected to accelerated wind flows that move from the windward sides of the medium-rise buildings located next to the test point to the leeward sides of high-rise buildings. In contrast at 190\u00b0, the maximum K values of the wind flows do not show a strong dependence at 0\u00b0because of the local flow circulations govern the wind conditions at the test point than the undisturbed wind flow that approaches the site. The high K values in the directions between 180\u00b0to 200\u00b0indicate likely the existence of the acceptable wind conditions at test point 71 for these wind directions. Nevertheless, the overall wind condition at test point 71 can be categorised as low wind speed (LWS) for all wind flows as evinced by their average K values (i.e. = \u2211 =",

The K values of five winds are considerably different at 190\u00b0and 10\u00b0, for instance, the K values are within the range of 0.15-0.22 at 10\u00b0while the corresponding K values are 0.27-0.33 for the oncoming winds from 190\u00b0. This difference in K value is mainly resulted from the location of test point 73 with respect to an oncoming wind. More specifically, test point 73 has higher K values at 190\u00b0, where the test point is at the entrance of the passage than when the test point is at the exit for the oncoming wind from 10\u00b0.

This study confirms that twisted winds can affect the PLW field of an urban site even under low wind speeds thus may have significant impacts on engineering applications such as predicting air pollutant dispersion, assessing of pedestrian wind comfort, or estimating wind circulation at a site using the AVA. For example, The AVA, which requires accurate data on the PLW field at the site of interest to make unerring decisions, tends to make predictions that are different from the field conditions, if AVA does not employ twisted wind profiles for the evaluation. This hypothesis will be tested in a future study by integrating twisted wind profiles into the AVA.",

The individual maxima of the wind flows' K values recorded at test point 12 are different: for example, while CWP's maximum K value is 0.37, the maximum K values of the four twisted wind flows are 0.36 in TWP13-CW, 0.34 in TWP22-CW, 0.40 in TWP13-ACW, and 0.37 in TWP22-ACW. The maximum K values of the twisted winds with clockwise yaw angles are smaller than the maximum K value of CWP at test point 12 but with counter-clockwise yaw angles, the twisted winds' maximum K values are larger than those of CWP. The directions where maximum K values are recorded (\u03c6 Kmax ) are also slightly different between the twisted and conventional wind flows at test point 12. In fact, \u03c6 Kmax varies with the twisted wind flow's yaw angle. On the one hand, \u03c6 Kmax of TWP13-CW and TWP22-CW are 160\u00b0and 150\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0to 20\u00b0smaller than \u03c6 Kmax of CWP (170\u00b0); on the other hand, \u03c6 Kmax values are same or larger for TWP13-ACW (170\u00b0) and TWP22-ACW (180\u00b0) than for CWP. The minimum of CWP's K value at test point 12 is about 0.03 and happens at 290\u00b0resulting a difference in the maximum and minimum K values of CWP about 0.34 or an equivalent reduction of wind speed about",
