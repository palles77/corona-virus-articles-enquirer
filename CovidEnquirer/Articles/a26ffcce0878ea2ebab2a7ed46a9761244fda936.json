In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines available in Italy in preventing hospitalization for influenza and pneumonia, a matched case-control study was performed in elderly subjects during the 2010-2011 season in Genoa (Italy). cases and controls were matched in a 1:1 ratio according to gender, age, socio-economic status and type of influenza vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as IVe = [ x 100] and crude odds ratios were estimated through conditional logistic regression models. adjusted odds ratios were estimated through multivariable logistic models.",

The adjuvanted influenza vaccines (Fluad\u00ae considered together with Inflexal V\u00ae) were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization, their effectiveness being 94.8% (cI 77.1-98.8). adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 95.2% (cI 62.8-99.4) and 87.8 (cI 0.0-98.9) for Inflexal V\u00ae and Fluad\u00ae, respectively. Both adjuvanted vaccines proved effective, although the results displayed statistical significance only for Inflexal V\u00ae (p = 0.004), while for Fluad\u00ae statistical significance was not reached (p = 0.09). Our study is the first to provide information on the effectiveness of Inflexal V\u00ae in terms of reducing hospitalizations for influenza or pneumonia in the elderly, and demonstrates that this vaccine yields a high degree of protection and that its use would generate considerable saving for the National Health service.",

In Italy, influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for the elderly, and is offered free of charge at the vaccination facilities of Local Healthcare Units (LHUs) or by General Practitioners (GPs). For this reason, too, it is important to evaluate the performance of seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns. In this perspective, studies on the prevention of hospitalization appear to be very useful. Hospitalization of the elderly is the largest item of direct cost, at least during seasonal influenza epidemics in Italy. 14, 15 While traditional vaccines (not adjuvanted) and MF-59 \u00ae adjuvanted vaccines have been studied with regard to their effectiveness in reducing hospitalizations and mortality in the elderly, no such studies have been conducted on Inflexal V \u00ae . 11, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Studies on the effectiveness of Inflexal V \u00ae have been performed in terms of the prevention of Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILIs). 22, 23 In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines available in Italy in preventing hospitalization for influenza and pneumonia, a matched case-control study was performed in elderly subjects during the 2010-2011 season in Genoa, Italy.",

Furthermore, more cases than controls suffered from heart disease (p = 0.0002), respiratory disease (p < 0.0001) and renal disease (p = 0.0007). By contrast, controls were more often affected by rheumatologic disease (p = 0.0033). The high-risk medical conditions of hypertension, liver disease and cancer were similarly distributed among cases and controls. Pneumococcal vaccination was received by 9.1% risk of serious influenza complications. About 90% of excess mortality due to influenza and about 50% of excess hospitalizations occur among the elderly. 5, 6 Moreover, as underlined by the US. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the complications of influenza more often affect persons over 64 y of age, especially those aged over 75 y, as well as children and people of all ages with recognized risk conditions. 7, 8 It is acknowledged that the only really effective means of combating influenza and its possible complications is vaccination. 7, 8 Many studies support the hypothesis that influenza vaccination significantly reduces the risk of severe complications, e.g., hospitalizations for pneumonia and death among the elderly living in communities. 6, [9] [10] [11] In subjects over 64 y of age, vaccination against influenza seems to reduce hospitalizations by 50-60% and mortality by up to 80%. 7 However, these studies are open to potential bias, since several variables can influence evaluations of efficacy/effectiveness.",

This information is consistent with the results obtained by Pregliasco et al. and Consonni et al., 22, 23 although these authors considered another outcome, i.e., the efficacy of virosomal influenza vaccine in preventing Influenza-Like Illness in the elderly. In particular, Consonni et al. who performed their study during the 2002-2003 influenza season, found a 62% rate of protection against ILI. 23 Our analysis showed much greater effectiveness in reducing hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia than other studies. Indeed, practically no other previous research has registered similar levels of effectiveness. Only one study, conducted by Puig-Barber\u00e0 in 1994-96, found a vaccine efficacy of 79% with regard to radiologically confirmed pneumonia hospitalization, 26 and a case-control study performed by Herrera in 2003-04 showed 90% vaccine efficacy against influenza hospitalization, though that was in non-high-risk 50-64-y-old subjects. 27 It is important",

Indeed, their effectiveness in preventing hospitalization was 94.8% (CI 77.1-98.8%). (Fig. 2) . The co-circulation of other respiratory viruses was particular important in infants and children, 40 but could have had some importance in terms of information bias. However, it is well known that this kind of bias can lead to the underestimation of effectiveness. 35 We selected our cases in the two largest hospitals in Genoa; the GPs of these subjects were then identified. Starting from the GP's database, an appropriate control subject was matched to the case by age, sex, socio-economic level and type of vaccine. This procedure enabled us to minimise the variability within each case-control pair, and yielded cases and controls residing in the same neighborhood of the city. Information on hospital discharge diagnoses, underlying diseases, life style and risk conditions were obtained from medical records and, with regard to cases, also from hospital medical records.

The most important one is that these studies have usually been conducted independently of repeated yearly vaccinations, and of the type, dosage, timing or administration schedule of the various influenza vaccines. Furthermore, the authors have completely ignored the technological evolution of influenza vaccines during the study period (such as techniques for determining the antigen dose, introduction of national and international quality control, etc). In addition, when studies of different power and with different specific outcomes are combined and considered equally, the results are difficult to interpret and often inconclusive. 38, 39 In order to limit the multiple effects of the great number of variables which can influence the effectiveness of influenza vaccine, our study was designed to take into account possible selection, information bias and confounding bias. The study was performed during the period of maximum incidence of Service. However, the fact that influenza diagnoses were not confirmed in the laboratory suggests both that our results should be considered with caution and that other studies will be needed in order to confirm the excellent performance of Inflexal V \u00ae in preventing hospitalizations for influenza and pneumonia.",

For example, 52.6% of cases with heart disease and 46.5% of those with respiratory disease were not vaccinated. Although the Italian Ministry of Health has set the objective of vaccinating 75% of the elderly population during annual influenza vaccination campaigns, current coverage is about 58% in Italy as a whole, and 62% in Genoa (Data from Liguria Region -Influenza vaccination: 2010-2011 season). 44 For this reason, it is very important to raise awareness of the utility of influenza vaccination in the elderly; it is also advisable to implement training courses for GPs. Furthermore in occasion of annual influenza vaccination campaign, it is useful to vaccinate the elderly against pneumococcal infections. Indeed, the synergism between influenza infection and a greater susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae is well established. 45 With regard to this item, our results also demonstrate that vaccination against S. pneumoniae was significantly more frequent among controls than cases, although the pneumococcal vaccination status of many subjects, both cases and controls, could not be ascertained.",
