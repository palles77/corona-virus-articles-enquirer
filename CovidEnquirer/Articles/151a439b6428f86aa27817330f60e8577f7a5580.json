            "text": "Background: The potential role of respiratory viruses in the natural history of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults has not been well described since the advent of nucleic amplification tests (NATs). Methods: From 2004 to 2006, adults with CAP who were admitted to five hospitals were prospectively enrolled in the study, and clinical data, cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. NATs from swabs were tested for influenza, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1-4, coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), and adenovirus. Results: A total of 193 patients were included; the median age was 71 years, 51 % of patients were male, and 47% of patients had severe CAP. Overall, 75 patients (39%) had a pathogen identified. Of these pathogens, 29 were viruses (15%), 38 were bacteria (20%), 8 were mixed (4%), and the rest were \"unknown.\" Influenza (n =7), hMPV (n =7), and RSV (n =5) accounted for most viral infections; other infections included rhinovirus (n =4), parainfluenza (n =3), coronavirus (n = 4), and adenovirus (n = 2). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial infection (37%). Compared with bacterial infection, patients with viral infection were older (76 vs 64 years, respectively; p = 0.01), were more likely to have cardiac disease (66% vs 32%, respectively; p =0.006), and were more frail (eg, 48% with limited ambulation vs 21% of bacterial infections; p =0.02). There were few clinically meaningful differences in presentation and no differences in outcomes according to the presence or absence of viral infection. Conclusions: Viral infections are common in adults with pneumonia. Easily transmissible viruses such as influenza, hMPV, and RSV were the most common, raising concerns about infection control. Routine testing for respiratory viruses may be warranted for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia.",

Such tests are limited in the sample type to which they can be applied and are not suitable for a broad range of respiratory viruses. More recently, the introduction of highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) has dramatically improved our ability to detect multiple viral pathogens such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and adenovirus. Such tests can be undertaken using a small Single sample of respiratory secretions with results available with rapid turnaround times. 7 -12 In addition, these tests have allowed us to detect emerging respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and coronaviruses, viruses that are difficult to grow in cell culture.

Although the importance of S pneurrwniae and atypical bacterial pathogens is well understood in patients with CAP, in this prospective cohort study we have now demonstrated the significant potential contribution of respiratory viruses in patients presenting with pneumonia. Indeed, fully one sixth of all cases (15%) in this cohort of adults who were hospitalized with pneumonia had a respiratory virus identified; alternatively, more than one third of those",

Specifically, there were no differences in median length of hospital stay (patients with viral infection, 7 days [IQR, 6 to 10 days]; patients with bacterial infection, patients (39%) with a pathogen identified had a respiratory viral infection. Influenza, hMPV, and RSV comprised almost two thirds of all cases of viral infection and, in our study, were acquired during the influenza season. There were some differences in presentation between those patients with a viral infection and those without, including the following: older age; presence of cardiac disease (but in the near absence of chest pain on presentation); and greater frailty. Of note, patients with a viral infection were far more likely than patients with bacterial pneumonia to have a normal leukocyte count. Despite these apparent differences, given that the majority of our cohort never had a respiratory pathogen identified, it is obviously very difficult to distinguish the presence or absence of viral infection in patients with pneumonia. This is further borne out by the fact that outcomes were virtually identical irrespective of the pathogens involved.",

In our cohort, viral infection without evidence of bacterial coinfection was detected 15% of the time, which falls within the commonly reported range. 26 A study by Marcos et al.!? which used NATs, reported a similar prevalence of viral infection in Spain. However, the study by Marcos et al lO differed from ours in several noteworthy ways, as follows: they did not test for hMPV; and they included immunocompromised patients in their study. Our results also differ from those of Jennings et al,5 as follows: they documented a viral infection 29% of the time in their cohort of adults with CAP, but, surprisingly, more than a third of infections were attributed to rhinovirus, and almost one fifth were mixed infections. The impact of rhinoviruses in our study may be underestimated as data 27 have indicated that the picornavirus family of viruses is much more variable than originally thought. It is extremely difficult to design and validate assays to pick up all divergent rhinoviruses, and the original assay design that we utilized in this study would not identify all those that have been reported.F This is an inherent limitation in the type of study undertaken; as we identify more novel respiratory pathogens and variants, it is inevitable that some will have been missed.",

            "text": "The strengths of this study include its prospective nature and the thorough collection of data from a cohort of consecutive patients who had been admitted to the hospital with CAP. There are also several limitations to the study. First and foremost, despite our best efforts and a detailed study protocol, a number of bacterial investigations iie, blood culture, sputum culture, and convalescent serum specimens) www.chestjournal.org were missed, thereby potentially underestimating the number of cases of bacterial pneumonia and (potentially) underestimating the number of mixed infections. The number of missed bacterial investigations may be the reason for our 61% rate of unknown infections, although our rate of recovery is similar to other studies 22 ,3 1--34 that have reported 47 to 60% unknown infections, Second, we excluded patients without evaluable NP swabs from our analyses. Not obtaining specimens for conducting a NAT was a study protocol violation in 13% of patients (39 of 300 patients). We speculate that either NP swabs were not collected when patients transitioned from the emergency department to the wards, or that there was a miscommunication with the reference laboratory regarding when or where to send the study-related swabs, That said, there were few important clinical differences between patients with and without evaluable NP swabs, with two excep-CHEST/134/6/ DECEMBER, 2008 tions. Those patients without evaluable NP swabs were more likely to have lobar pneumonia, which, according to our data, would bias the results toward bacterial infection. Those patients without evaluable NP swabs were also more likely to be functionally impaired, which would bias the results toward viral infection. Third, there is potential for both falsepositive and false-negative NP results, although testing with NATs has been reported to have excellent sensitivity and speciflcity.P As noted above, sequence divergence for the rhinoviruses (and, potentially for the other virus groups) may also have led to some underestimation of the number of viral infections. Fourth, we detected viruses in the upper respiratory tract using NP specimens, which does not necessarily equate with the causation of pneumonia. However, the purpose of this study was to describe the potential role of respiratory viral infection in those patients with pneumonia; a study describing \"confirmed\" viral pneumonia would require lung tissue samples from all enrolled patients. Last, our overall sample size might be considered small by some, and our cohort was drawn from only one health region in Canada, which might limit the generalizability of the results to some degree.",

            "text": "In our study, patients with pneumonia and respiratory viral infection were older and more frail than 1146 those without evidence of viral infection. Differentiating between patients with viral infection and those without based on clinical findings and routine laboratory test results remains a challenge. Indeed, although we were unable to perform a multivariable logistic regression analysis due to the small sample size, it seems unlikely that any constellation of symptoms, signs, and routine laboratory findings will ever reliably differentiate between the presence or absence of a viruS. 3 , 1O,29 ,30 Current guidelines:] recommend empiric antibiotic therapy targeted against common bacterial pathogens for patients who are admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. How to manage patients with pneumonia and a respiratory viral infection, without a documented coexisting bacterial pathogen, is far less clear. Future research, similar to that found in the pediatrics literature, is needed to help answer whether empiric therapv with antibiotics can be discontinued in this clinic~1 seenario.F' Perhaps most importantly, the inability to identify patients with a respiratory virus without comprehensive respiratory viral testing is a concern from the perspective of infection control. The presence of a respiratory viral infection can result in nosocomial outbreaks. For instance, outbreaks due to influenza have been well documented.s\" and cases of RSV and hMPV nosocomial transmission are increasingly recognized. 21i , 36.37 The nosocomial spread of respiratory viruses among adults poses the biggest threat to immunocompromised patients, including frail elderly patients: 3 ,31i-40 The current infection control guidelines recommend placing patients with a suspected respiratory viral infection in private rooms or cohorting them with patients with the same viral infection as a way to prevent transmission.\" Given the 15% prevalence of viral infection in adults in our study, and the indistinguishable presentation from typical bacterial pneumonia, our results suggest routine isolation (with droplet and contact precautions) of all adults with pneumonia, from the time of hospital admission until respiratory viral infection is ruled out, should be considered to help prevent the nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses. This suggested approach should become logistically feasible when the turnaround time for NAT results is < 24 h and as the price of testing with NATs decreases over time. This will be facilitated by emerging commercial viral identification assays that are both accurate and relatively inexpensive.P CONCLUSION Infections with respiratory viruses are common in patients who are hospitalized with pneumonia, com-prising 39% of all identified pathogens and 15%of all patients in our study. Influenza, hMPV, and RSV were the most common respiratory viruses identified. In patients presenting with pneumonia, it remains difficult to differentiate patients with viral infection from those without viral infection. Our findings suggest that routine testing for common respiratory viruses may be warranted for all adults hospitalized with pneumonia.",
