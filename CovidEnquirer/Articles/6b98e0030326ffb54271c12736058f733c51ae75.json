Methods: This study was conducted from March to July, 2005, using semi-structured in-depth interviews to collect data. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze the transcribed data. Interviewees included media reporters, media supervisors, health and medical institution executives or spokespersons, and social observers. Results: Altogether, 35 interviewees were recruited for in-depth interviews, and the duration of the interview ranged from 1 hour to 2 hours. Results revealed that the most important characteristics of health/medical institutions spokespersons are professional competence and good interaction with the media. In contrast, the most important behaviors they should avoid are concealing the truth and misreporting the truth. Three major flaws of spokespersons' performance were identified: they included poor understanding of media needs and landscape; blaming the media to cover up a mistake they made in an announcement; and lack of sufficient participation in decision-making or of authorization from the head of organization.",

            "text": "Crisis and emergency risk communication has become an important issue in the public health sector in recent years, due to a series of health risks ranging from bioterrorist threats (e.g., anthrax attacks), 1 to newly emerging infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., Influenza A pandemic). 2 The challenge of providing timely and accurate health information dissemination is highlighted, 3e5 especially for public information officers/spokespersons in shaping the public response to health crises. 6, 7 The well-known Crisis Emergency and Risk Communication training module, which was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2002, is recognized as a communication model of public health in emergency situations and provides a theoretical framework for research and practice. 8e10 According to Crisis Emergency and Risk Communication, a spokesperson in an emergency is \"to communicate information the public wants or needs to know to reduce the incidence of illness and death.\" 11 The trustworthiness and credibility of the spokesperson were also emphasized during a crisis. 11 Given the evidence that people will search for information and take self-protective action when facing a health threat, 12 the importance of spokespersons in facilitating effective risk and health emergency communication is salient. 6,13e15 As indicated by Covello, 16 the six components of best practice in public health risk and crisis communication plan include having stakeholders as partners, listening to people's voices, being honest and open, collaborating with credible sources, meeting the media's needs, and communicating clearly. The selection of a credible spokesperson facilitates effective information dissemination as the public receive information from diverse sources during the uncertain and chaotic situation of a health crisis. A study of public perceptions of information sources concerning bioterrorism, before and after anthrax attacks, indicated the importance of national and regional health officials as spokespersons in this event. 17 In response to the anthrax attacks of 2001, selecting credible spokespersons was found to be one of the challenges for the CDC, 18 and the use of multiple spokespersons and poor message control were found to result in the loss of CDC credibility. 19 A recent study regarding public health officials as potential spokespeople revealed that news stories containing interviews with public health officials were 15.2 times more likely to report quality information, after controlling for station affiliate or geographic location. 20 The characteristics and performance of official spokespersons would influence the public's actions and their perception and trust during crisis communication. 7, 13 In 2003, the first serious newly emerging infectious disease of the 21st century, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), struck Taiwan and spread through the health care system. 21, 22 Taiwan was added to the travel alert list by the World Health Organization from May 21 to July 5 of that year. Taiwan's number of SARS cases was the third highest in the world, after China and Hong Kong. 23 An increase of international media coverage due to the uncertain nature and rapid spread of the SARS pandemic was observed. 24 The SARS pandemic had a major impact on Taiwan, with the Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital shutting down due to the occurrence of a mass infection, and largescale community quarantine. 21, 25, 26 The demand for news from the government was huge and the media scrutiny was strict. Influenced by media reporting, there was widespread fear and panic among the public. 26 The spokespersons' performance in front of a television camera and with reporters would have great impacts on delivering needed and correct information for disease prevention and control. 15 It is noted that, as a newly emerging infectious disease, the public understanding of the SARS pandemic was shaped in large part by the performance of public health officials as spokespersons for the national and local health departments as well as by the medical institutions through the daily press conference during the crisis period.",

We therefore provided a \"2003 Taiwan SARS news events list\" to help interviewees recall the SARS event. Despite these limitations, this study provided data on the perception of traits of spokespersons and criteria useful in selecting public health officials and hospital managers as spokespersons in SARS crisis communication. Possessing excellent media skills and understanding of the public and media expectations of spokespersons may help deal with possible emerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks in the future.",

            "text": "In conclusion, spokespersons of health and medical institutions play an important role in media relations during a large-scale health emergency, especially for a newly emerging infectious disease such as SARS. Therefore, it is recommended that the health departments strengthen the continuing education on the issues of crisis communication, media relations and emotional management. Crisis communication is an on-going process. Media relationships need to be developed at the precrisis stage, and the lead spokesperson needs to have sufficient authority and involvement in decision making. Future studies might focus on the challenge of new media in the dissemination of information and rumor control during a health crisis.",
