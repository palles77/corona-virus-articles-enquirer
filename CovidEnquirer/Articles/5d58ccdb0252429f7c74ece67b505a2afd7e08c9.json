We performed a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses using the patients' preserved BAL fluid. The final diagnosis was made by a multidisciplinary approach and after considering the PCR results. The diagnosis at discharge was compared to the final diagnosis. Results Among the 109 patients, 53 were diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia and other diseases showed some differences in symptoms and laboratory data; however, the differences were small or overlapped. Viral pneumonia was misdiagnosed on discharge as acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (AFOP/COP/CEP) (n=22), acute interstitial pneumonia (n=5), connective tissue disease-related ILDs (n=3), unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia (n=2), drug-induced ILD (n=1), and pneumonia (n=20). Conclusion Approximately half of the patients who underwent BAL had viral pneumonia. The most common ILD-related misdiagnoses were AFOP/COP/CEP. Differences in symptoms and laboratory findings between viral pneumonia and other diseases were small, and viral pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis when physicians encounter cases in which the abovementioned ILDs are suspected.",

All patients had been provided with a diagnosis on discharge. During the hospitalization period, respiratory physicians licensed by the Japanese Respiratory Society performed BAL according to conventional methods (2) on these patients for differential diagnosis. The obtained BALF was transported on dry ice, stored at -70\u00baC, and used for the detection of respiratory pathogens on a Rotor-Gene Q instrument (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a multiplex, realtime PCR (RT-PCR) using an FTD Resp 21 Kit (Fast Track Diagnostics, Silema, Malta). The kit detects the following respiratory pathogens: influenza A and B viruses; coronaviruses (CoV) NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus A/B (hMPV); rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B; adenovirus; enterovirus; human parechovirus (HPeV); bocavirus; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. An EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 was used for nucleic acid extraction (Quiagen).

The pathological findings were reviewed by a pathologist (Y. S). Then, in November 2018, a multidisciplinary diagnosis (final diagnosis) was established based on the laboratory, pathological and radiological findings, PCR results, and the clinical course by a review panel composed of pulmonary physicians (N. T and N. K), radiologists (T. K and N. T), and a pathologist (Y. S). A multidisciplinary diagnosis of viral pneumonia was made based on a positive virus PCR result, a compatible clinical course, and histological and radiological findings. In contrast, we considered that virus colonization had occurred if patients showed findings that were unlikely to indicate viral pneumonia, and an alternative diagnosis was made by a review panel. In the present study, patients with a diagnosis of AFOP, COP, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) were classified into the same category because of their overlapping histological patterns (3) . The diagnostic criteria of the established guidelines (3) (4) (5) were also considered in the multidisciplinary diagnosis. Causative microorganisms of pneumonia were defined using conventional methods that have been reported previously (6) .",

Our study compared viral pneumonia and other acute diseases and found that sore throat and fever were observed significantly more frequently in patients with viral pneumonia than in those with other diseases. Laboratory tests showed higher liver transaminase and CRP values, and lower numbers of eosinophils in the BALF of patients with viral pneumonia than in those with other diseases. Our study also showed that it was difficult to distinguish viral pneumonia from acute ILDs or pneumonia due to unknown etiology using procalcitonin alone, although procalcitonin is used as a marker for discriminating between viral and bacterial infections (11) . Conventional diagnostic tests for respiratory viral infection include culture, serology, and direct fluorescence antibody staining; however, these methods are limited by slow turnaround time or insufficient sensitivity. Although PCR techniques are more labor intensive and technically demanding and require specialized laboratory equipment, they have high sensitivity, and our study suggested their usefulness in the detection of viral infection. Nasopharyngeal RDTs in 10 patients with primary influenza viral pneumonia were all negative in our study, which was supported by the low sensitivity of nasopharyngeal RDTs in the 2009 pandemic (12) . We did not perform RDTs using BALF; however, PCR tests using BALF were useful and are recommended for the diagnosis of primary influenza viral pneumonia. Some of our study patients had positive PCR results that were considered to indicate colonization. In previous adult studies, viruses were detected in 0.4-4.2% of asymptomatic patients (13) (14) (15) (16) . Differentiating infection and colonization is still difficult using PCR methods; thus, physicians should not diagnose patients as having a viral infection based on PCR results alone.",

Various influenza-associated pneumonias that show similar CT patterns to COP, AFOP, and AIP have been reported (19) , and a previous report focusing on primary influenza suggested the (20) . Then CT findings in our patients with viral pneumonia were compatible with the diagnosis, but the spectrum of CT findings encountered in viral pneumonia (21-23) is non-specific and is also found in the above ILDs. Physicians should include viral pneumonia in the differential diagnosis of imaging patterns that are suggestive of these diseases. In addition, the histological findings in our patients with viral pneumonia, which were mostly obtained via TBLB, were also non-specific (24) , and it was difficult to suspect viral pneumonia on the basis of histological findings alone. In most patients with viral pneumonia, treatment is mainly supportive care. The efficacy of NIs is partially reported in influenza-associated pneumonia (25) , NIs were effective in some of our patients. It is recommended that NIs be administered within 48 hours from the onset of symptoms; however, NIs administered after this 48-h period were effective in some of our patients. Regarding the treatment of viral infections other than influenza virus, immunoglobulin therapy (pegylated interferon-alpha2A) for rhinovirus, the potential efficacy of palivizumab for RSV, ribavirin (a guanosine analogue) therapy for RSV and hMPV, and cidofovir (the nucleoside analogue of cytidine monophosphate) for adenovirus infection have been reported (26) . However, the efficacy of these treatments for primary viral pneumonia is unknown. Severe cases require aggressive treatment, including antiviral therapy; however, one problem we found was that viral pneumonia was not infrequently caused by multiple viruses. Similar results have been reported elsewhere (27) . It may be useful for physicians to test for multiple viruses simultaneously when considering antiviral therapy.",

Second, this study was carried out in a single center, and the results may not be applicable to other settings. It is noteworthy that our institution has about 10 specialist physicians licensed by the Japan Respiratory Society. These physicians judged the need for BAL, and thus, there was bias in terms of the patients who underwent BAL. In addition, the requirement for hospitalization was a major criterion for entry into this study. This could potentially induce a spectrum bias in which only the most severe cases were enrolled in the study. Third, there may be incorporation bias in that the review panel determined that the final diagnosis was more likely to classify cases as viral pneumonia when fever and sore throat were present. Fourth, we did not investigate antibody titers against viruses in the acute and convalescent phases; thus, the number of cases of viral pneumonia might have been underestimated (32) . Fifth, the multidisciplinary diagnoses were made without video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in most cases; thus, the pathological findings may not have been fully evaluated. Sixth, some viral infections may have been missed in this study because only a limited number of viruses were screened in the assay. Finally, the possibility of detecting viruses from the upper respiratory tracts cannot be denied when using the BAL technique. To avoid this concern, a well-designed, prospective study is needed in which samples are obtained only from the lower respiratory tract, for example, via intubation or with the use of a protected specimen brush.",

The diagnoses of the 109 patients on discharge included AIP (n=8), AFOP/COP/CEP (n=33), pneumonia (n=24), DILD (n=19), CTD-ILD (n=15), unclassifiable IP (n=4), AHP (n=3), AEP (n=2), and radiation-primed OP (n=1).
