Improvements of current commercial molecular assays to reduce hands-on-time rely on two strategies, a stepwise automation (semi-automation) and the complete automation of the whole procedure. Contributions to the former strategy have been the use of automated nucleic acids extractors, multiplex PCR, real-time PCR and/or DNA arrays for detection of amplicons. Commercial fully-automated molecular systems are now available for the detection of respiratory viruses. Some of them could convert in point-of-care methods substituting antigen tests for detection of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses. This article describes laboratory methods for detection of respiratory viruses. A cost-effective and rational diagnostic algorithm is proposed, considering technical aspects of the available assays, infrastructure possibilities of each laboratory and clinic-epidemiologic factors of the infection. \u00a9 P\u00e9rez-Ruiz et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.",

Besides classical respiratory viruses (RV), i.e. influenza viruses (Flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1-4, adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 and 229E [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , other \"new\" RV have currently been added to this list, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [10] , SARS-CoV [11] , HCoV NL63 and HKU1 [12, 13] , human bocavirus (hBoV) [14] and others. Most RV cause benign and self-limited infections in immunocompetent adults. However, clinical impact of ARI increases when they affect children, elderly, immunocompromised individuals and/or subjects with chronic underlying diseases, in whom RV constitute an important cause of hospitalisations, mainly during the cold months of the year [15, 16] . They involve important costs for health systems and constitute a frequent cause of school and work absenteeism. In certain circumstances, emerging RV cause a great impact in health systems worldwide, as occurred with SARS-CoV and Flu pandemics, the last one taking place in 2009. Aetiological diagnosis of viral ARI is crucial in order to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use, to establish the appropriate use of antiviral drugs and a comprehensive cohort of hospitalised patients that minimizes the risk of nosocomial transmission, and to provide epidemiological information for an early release of recommendations for the prevention and *Address correspondence to this author at the Servicio de Microbiolog\u00eda.

Thus, to detect the most prevalent RV, multiple cell lines must be used. The combination of shell-vial assay with the inclusion of different cell lines in the same vial has represented a subsequent step that has facilitated the recovery of RV isolates from cell cultures [19] [20] [21] . NAAT have recently contributed to increase the sensitivity of viral culture. PCR assays can be carried out on the cell culture supernatant to detect the isolates. This approach has demonstrated the highest sensitive reading procedure, and has allowed identifying viral isolates in cell monolayers with no cytopathic effect [22] . However, viral culture is not useful for detection of new RV, since they do not grow or grow poorly in cell culture. For this purpose, the best alternative is NAAT.",

This allows rapid detection and differentiation between viral and bacterial respiratory infections (Flu A, Flu B, RSV, hMPV, PIV 1, PIV2, PIV3, ADV and Streptococcus pneumoniae). The test is very simple to operate and handson-time is less than a minute per sample. Results for highly positive samples are obtained in 20 minutes whereas low positive and negative samples are reported in 2 hours. The mariPOC \u00ae system uses polystyrene microparticles as solid phase reaction carriers for the immunocomplex formation. Viral antigens are captured by specific antibodies fixed onto the microsphere and bind to a fluorescentlylabelled conjugate. The amount of immunocomplexes formed on the microsphere is proportional to the analyte concentration. Detection of the fluorescence signal is carried out by separation-free two-photon excitation fluorescence detection assay, the ArcDia TM TPX (TPX). In contrast to other antigen detection methods, TPX assay avoids the need for multiple washes, and readout is achieved by on-line monitoring of reaction kinetics [26] . Preliminary studies have reported a sensitivity and specificity of this method comparable to ultrasensitive fluorescent immunoassays (DELPHIA \u00ae method) [27, 28] and offers the advantage of automated result readout, allowing connections to laboratory information systems.",

Indeed, multiplex PCR extends the portfolio of virological diagnostic methods. Although advantages are strong enough to compensate for any disadvantage, multiplex PCR have intrinsic inconveniences: as the number of targets increase, the possibility of losing sensitivity and specificity increases as well, due to competition among primers and viral targets that consequently yields unspecific PCR products. Indeed, multiplex PCR has to be optimized to ensure the adequate amplification of each viral genome. Multiplex PCR assays have demonstrated that co-detections of RV in a sample are a common event [29] .

Common PCR parameters of 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00baC for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60\u00baC for 60 s, can be applied to any real-time assay [36] . This protocol is carried out in our laboratory for any RNA virus, including RV such as Flu, RSV, HRV, hMPV, hBoV and HCoV, by using the same instrument and the same protocol (personal communication). The technical disadvantage of real-time PCR is the limited number of fluorophores that can be included in a single assay, thus, limiting the multiplexing capabilities. In the best case, 3 targets can be detected in a single tube. A published protocol is able to detect 12 RV by a multiplex real-time PCR, including 4 tubes per sample and 3 viral targets per tube [37] .",

Moreover, specific antiviral therapy is recommended for treating certain risk groups with Flu and RSV infection. Neuraminidase inhibitors are recommended in patients with suspected or confirmed Flu who require hospitalisation and/or in high-risk groups. Early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors has demonstrated to decrease the risk of complications, to reduce the duration of the disease and to improve outcome [54] . Ribavirin is approved for the treatment of hospitalised infants, young children and immunocompromised adults with severe lower respiratory tract infections due to RSV, despite the limited evidence of benefit [58, 59] . New automated assays may improve point-of-care diagnosis of RV since they include a wider range of pathogens within the same kit. In future, automated NAAT may be the alternative of antigen detection methods if costs become comparable and a reduction of turnaround time is achieved.",

With this premise, NAAT for detection of RSV and Flu (at the type and subtype level) in patients with less severe ARI, that do not require admission at intensive care units (ICU), should be carried out first of all. Otherwise, other molecular multiplexed methods of low complexity could be performed in certain patients that included hMPV, HRV and PIV detection, depending on patient's age and/or the existence of underlying diseases. More complex NAAT that detect other less frequent RV should be reserved to certain situations such as more severe cases (ICU patients) in which previous NAAT for the most prevalent viruses have yielded negative results [60] [61] [62] . At this level, automated and semi-automated NAAT may provide higher throughput than in-house protocols.",
