In February 2007, mumps re-emerged in university students in Nova Scotia. Despite highly sensitive methods for mumps virus detection, only 14% (298/2082) of cases during the peak of the outbreak were laboratory confirmed. Objectives: Due to the low positivity rate, this study investigated whether infection with other viral pathogens caused mumps-like presentations during the outbreak. Study design: 148 buccal specimens from patients who presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis but had negative laboratory tests for mumps virus were tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) by quantitative PCR and 21 different viral markers using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP). Companion sera to each buccal specimen were available for EBV and CMV serology to differentiate acute infection from reactivation. Results: No correlation was observed since viral pathogens were detected in both the parotitis and nonparotitis groups. Conclusion: Although there was co-circulation of other viral pathogens during the mumps outbreak, no difference was observed in the prevalence between patients who presented with or without parotitis. The low positivity rate for specimens submitted for mumps diagnostics was likely the result of increased Public Health messaging and physician inexperience in recognizing mumps infection, suggesting the clinical acumen for mumps diagnosis based solely on clinical presentation is low.",

However, 15-20% of mumps infections can be asymptomatic and 50% are associated with non-specific or respiratory symptoms. 15 In February 2007, mumps re-emerged in university students in Nova Scotia. During the height of the outbreak (February to July, 2007), our laboratory performed over 3410 PCR tests for mumps virus on approximately 2082 patients. 6 Of these, 298 positive PCR results were obtained, yielding a positivity rate of 14.3% (298/2082). 6 The low positivity rate highlights the difficulty with diagnosing mumps infection based solely on clinical presentation. However, the possibility that infection with other circulating viruses could mimic mumps has yet to be explored. * Corresponding author at: Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology ",

To resolve whether the presence of EBV or CMV was due to reactivation rather than primary infection, companion sera submitted at the same time as the buccal specimen were tested for serologic evidence of acute infection. The study was approved by the Capital Health Research Ethics Board. All samples were collected previously and annonamized with no patient identifiers prior to testing.",

            "text": "In addition, some patients in this study could have truly had mumps but had falsely negative RT-PCR results. Although RT-PCR on buccal specimens is the best diagnostic test for mumps, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was only 79% during this outbreak. 6 It is also possible that specimens were collected too late after the onset of symptoms to yield a positive RT-PCR result. However, the majority of specimens were submitted during the first few days of symptoms when viral shedding should be maximal. 6 This is the first study that has used molecular methods to systematically identify other viral pathogens from patients who present with parotitis during a mumps outbreak. Although other viral pathogens were circulating during the mumps outbreak, we failed to show any correlation between parotitis and viral pathogens that could mimic the clinical presentation of mumps infection. The most likely explanation for the low positivity rate may simply be the result of increased Public Health messaging which in the UK has lead to increased rates of reporting by front line clinicians. 13 In addition, because the majority of the patients in the Nova Scotia outbreak had one dose of a mumps containing vaccine, this partial immunity likely modified the clinical presentation of mumps infection including minimally enlarged salivary glands and lower viral shedding making laboratory confirmation difficult. While we cannot conclusively say that physicians were inexperienced as we have not directly surveyed them regarding their experiences, the very low prevalence of disease in the decade preceding this outbreak suggests that many physicians would not have seen a case of mumps in their careers. This possible inexperience in combination with possible atypical presentations and increased public health messaging, led to increased specimen submission on patients with non-specific symptoms. This reflects the difficulty in diagnosing mumps in a partially immunized population, a challenge faced by front line clinicians during this outbreak.",
