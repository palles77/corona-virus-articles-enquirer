            "text": "A comprehensive proteomic profiling of nasal epithelium (NE) is described. This study relies on simple subcellular fractionation used to obtain soluble-and membrane-enriched fractions followed by 2-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) separation and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The cells were collected using a brushing technique applied on NE of clinically evaluated volunteers. Subsequently, the soluble-and the membrane-protein enriched fractions were prepared and analyzed in parallel using 2D-LC-MS/MS. In a set of 1482 identified proteins, 947 (63.9%) proteins were found to be associated to membrane fraction. Grand average hydropathy value index (GRAVY) analysis, the transmembrane protein mapping and annotations of primary location deposited in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) confirmed an enrichment of hydrophobic proteins on this dataset. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of soluble fraction revealed an enrichment of molecular and cellular functions associated with cell death, protein folding and drug metabolism while in membrane fraction showed an enrichment of functions associated with molecular transport, protein trafficking and cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. The IPA showed similar enrichment of functions associated with cellular growth and proliferation in both soluble and membrane subproteomes. This finding was in agreement with protein content analysis using exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI). A comparison of our data with previously published studies focusing on respiratory tract epithelium revealed similarities related to identification of proteins associated with physical barrier function and immunological defence. In summary, we extended the NE molecular profile by identifying and characterizing proteins associated to pivotal functions of a respiratory epithelium, including the control of fluid volume and ionic composition at the airways' surface, physical barrier maintenance, detoxification and immunological defence.

            "text": "As air passes through the nose, three distinct respiratory processes are taking place in the nasal cavities: air filtering, heating and humidifying. Altogether, these functions constitute the air conditioning within the upper respiratory airways [1] . In the vestibular region, these cavities are lined by a skinlike epithelium that gradually changes towards the nasal valves to the characteristic pseudo-stratified columnar ciliated lining termed the respiratory epithelium [2] . As part of the nose's functions, nasal epithelium (NE), along with mucous airway surface liquid (ASL), provides an important physicochemical and immunological barrier against different factors targeting lower airways [2] . These defence mechanisms depend on mucociliary clearance, its regenerative capacity and ability to participate in immune responses by secreting pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, among others [3] . In fact, all respiratory passages, from the nose to the terminal bronchioles share these features reflecting their common susceptibility to various agents such as irritants/occupational sensitizers, allergens and microorganisms [2] . In both upper and lower airways, physiological responses to these agents include: narrowing of the lumen, mucous secretion and inflammation [1, 2] . Given the anatomical and physiological similarities, the concept of united airways is being increasingly discussed in clinical medicine leading to the notion that reactions in the upper airways (i.e., nose) influence or reflect complications in lower airways (i.e., lungs) [4] [5] [6] [7] . Therefore, NE cells, harvested by a non-invasive brushing procedure, have been used to assess upper and lower airway diseases [8, 9] . In this way, extensive characterization of NE proteome would allow better understanding of signaling pathways and networks driving the physiology or pathophysiology of the respiratory system. To the best of our knowledge, only three studies aimed to investigate human NE proteome have been published using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), one by our own group to search proteins associated with cystic fibrosis disease [10, 11] . Min-Man et al. [12] investigated proteins associated with the pathogenesis of nasal polyps and chronic sinusitis while Lee et al. constructed a partial 2DE reference map of nasal mucosa proteins. However, 2DE-based proteomics deliver poor coverage of membrane proteins [13] . Herein, we present a deeper investigation on human normal NE proteome using subcellular fractionation combined with solution-based approach targeting membrane proteins that relies on strong cation exchange-reverse-phase liquid chromatography (SCX-RPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to profile NE soluble-and membrane-enriched subproteomes.",

Immediately after brushing, recovered cells (around 2 \u00d7 10 6 ) were washed with ice-cold PBS, pelleted and preserved at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. Before cell pelleting, an aliquot was fixed and saved at 4\u00b0C for cytological analysis. Cellular preparations were qualitatively evaluated using conventional light microscopy to confirm the collection of a sufficient number of intact cells and the absence of evident contamination by blood cells caused by occasional bleeding that might occur during sample collection.",

The 2D-LC-MS/MS experiments were conducted as previously described [15, 16] . The CID spectra were analyzed using SEQUEST\u2122 operating on a Beowulf 18-node parallel virtual machine cluster computer (ThermoElectron, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using a UniProt non-redundant human proteome database (http://www.expasy.org, 03/2008 release). Only peptides with conventional tryptic termini (allowing for up to two internal missed cleavages) possessing delta-correlation scores (\u0394Cn) > 0. 1 3+ were considered as legitimate identifications. A final list of the identified proteins with the corresponding number of unique peptides (UPCs; non-redundant) and total counts for those peptides (TPCs) observed in two consecutive runs was obtained. The obtained identifications are the sum of 70 and 80 SCX fractions for the soluble and membraneenriched fractions, respectively, each analyzed in duplicate. Results were further analyzed using in-house developed software for determination of unique peptides and proteins, considering only positive identifications when at least 2 UPs per protein were assigned. To increase identification confidence, only proteins identified in three independent experiments were considered positively identified. The false discovery rate (FDR %) (peptide level) was calculated by searching the data against a decoy database and was estimated to be between 4.2% and 4.5%. To aid the biological interpretation of the extensive proteins' lists, proteins were categorized according to their Gene Ontology (GO) annotations using ProteinOn, a web tool focused on calculating GO-based protein semantic similarity [17] , curated information deposited in Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (http://www. hprd.org, release 8, July 2009) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Ingenuity\u00ae Systems, www.ingenuity.com). Putative transmembrane domains (TMD) and grand average hydropath value index (GRAVY) [18] were calculated by freely available tools (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM and http:// www.geneinfinity.org/sms_proteingravy.html). Protein amount in the samples was estimated by exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) [19] , an index that compares the number of parent ions per protein observed with the number of predicted peptides for each protein. For emPAI calculations, only predicted tryptic peptides with more than 5 amino acids (TP > 5aa) were considered for index calculation as smaller peptides are hardly identified by MS and fall out of the range of the MS analysis (>300 m/z). Protein contents in molar percentages were calculated by emPAI normalization between experiments, as described by Ishihama et al. ",

The analysis revealed that 513 proteins contained one or more mapped TMDs. Of those, 497 proteins (96.8%) belong to NE membrane fraction, which corresponds to 52.5% of all proteins identified in membrane-enriched fraction (Fig. 3B ). Considering that 21% of proteins within the entire human proteome contain one or more putative TMDs [21] , our results represent a significant enrichment of this proteins' class. The majority of proteins with five or more predicted TMDs elicit positive GRAVY indexes (Fig. 3C ), constituting about 14% of membrane's proteome. There is, however, a significant percentage of proteins in membrane fraction with no predicted TMDs (46.7%, corresponding to 442 proteins). Observation of many structural constituents of ribosomes, components of vesicle traffic machinery and some catalytic subunits of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (e.g., ATP5C1, ATP5I) and vacuolar ATPase (e.g., ATP6V1E1, ATP6V1A), located in inner mitochondrial membranes and endosomes, respectively, seems to point for a significant contamination with soluble/cytosolic proteins entrapped within membrane vesicles during the lysis step. Other factors such as the presence of membrane-attached proteins via lipid/glycolipid anchors or a deficiency in the algorithm to correctly classify all potential TMDs could be also considered. The GRAVY index calculation, a global descriptor of protein's solubility (proteins exhibiting positive GRAVY values are recognized as hydrophobic while proteins exhibiting negative GRAVY values are recognized as hydrophilic) [18] , revealed that 284 proteins (out of 1482) showed GRAVY values ranging from 0.0 to +1.2 and were found mainly in the membrane fraction. In contrast, the majority of proteins identified on the soluble and overlapping fraction had negative GRAVY (Fig. 3A ). Searching our dataset against human proteome database (UniProt Human, release March 2008) showed that 95 of the NE identified proteins had only previously been observed at the transcript level; three proteins are annotated as uncertain and one as in-silico predicted (Table SD2 -UniProt).",

            "text": "The top molecular and cellular functions in membrane fraction found in NE using IPA analysis were molecular transport ( Fig. 4 and Table SD4b ). A large number of identified proteins are involved in ion, amino acid and lipid transportation. The identification of several ion channels is consistent with the role of the respiratory epithelium in controlling the ionic composition and fluid volume at the airways surface, which is critical for normal lung physiology [22, 23] (Fig. 5) . Indeed, we have identified the electrogenic Na + /K + -ATPase subunits (ATP1A1, ATP1B1, ATP1B3) components of a pump located at basolateral membrane that drive the absorption of Na + at the apical membrane through the epithelial sodium channel ENaC [24] . The transepithelial electrical potential difference generated by Na + absorption also drives a transepithelial Cl \u2212 absorption to maintain the electroneutrality of the ion transport process. The Cl \u2212 ion must first enter the cell through the basolateral membrane by means of the Na + -K + -Cl \u2212 co-transporter (NKCC2), which was also identified in this study, being secreted at the apical membrane, for example, via the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The electrical driving force for Cl \u2212 secretion is also supplied by basolateral K + channels [25] . Although we were able to show the presence of CFTR in human NE by immunocytochemistry [14, 26, 27] neither CFTR, ENaC nor basolateral K + channels were identified in this study by two unique peptides identified in three independent runs. However, by lowering this threshold to one peptide, the CFTR was identified in four independent experiments by a total of five unique peptides. The high degree of hydrophobicity, extensive glycosylation of CFTR protein [28] and low expression in NE [29] may explain our inability to identify this protein using stringent identification thresholds. Similarly, important basolateral K + channels such as KCNN1, KCNN4, KCNJ5, KCND1 and KCNAB1 were also identified using less stringent thresholds, suggesting the low abundance of these regulatory proteins. However, a subunit of the electrogenic H + /K + -ATPase (ATP12A) was identified using stringent criteria. This protein, along with Na + /K + -ATPase, is responsible for maintenance of osmotic balance and intracellular ionic composition. Absorption or secretion of water in NE is driven by osmosis and determined by transepithelial NaCl movement through the lipid layer via aquaporin family of proteins [30, 31] . Here, aquaporin 5 (AQP5) was identified as the only molecule involved in water movement across the nasal epithelium. Our data also revealed the presence of the Na + /H + exchanger NHE1 and the bicarbonate transporter NBC1, which are involved in the maintenance of epithelial acidbase balance. The countertransport of H + in an electroneutral manner (1Na + :H + stoichiometry) by NHE exchangers, propelled by the inward Na + gradient established by plasma membrane Na + /K + -ATPase pumps, allows extrusion of H + excess (acid equivalents) accumulated by cellular metabolism. Additionally, bicarbonate cotransporters allow extrusion of HCO 3 \u2212 (1 Na + :HCO 3 \u2212 stoichiometry), a cellular biological buffer that is important for the solubilization of ions and macromolecules such as mucins and digestive enzymes in secreted fluids. Thus, the activity of those proteins is crucial not only to fine control of intracellular pH but also for cell volume control, systemic electrolyte, acid-base fluid volume homeostasis and epithelia protection from injury [32, 33] . Other ATPases, namely calcium pumps, were also identified in this fraction. Three Ca 2+ -ATPases have been described in the cells of higher animals. They are located in the membranes of endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum, including the nuclear envelope (SERCA pump), the Golgi network (the SPCA pump) and plasma membrane (PMCA pump) [34] . Each pump is a product of a multigene family, the number of isoforms being further increased by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts. In this study, several components of those three Ca 2+ pumps were identified: ATP2A1, ATP2A2 and ATP2A3 belonging to the SERCA pump, ATP2C1 belonging to the SPCA pump and ATP2B1, ATP2B4 belonging to the PMCA [34] . Components of V-type H + -ATPase were also identified, namely two subunits belonging to the membrane-embedded V0 complex (ATP6V0A4, ATP6V0C) and two subunits belonging to the citoplasmic V1 complex (ATP6AP1, ATP6V1E1) Fisher exact test was used to calculate a P value determining the probability that each biological function assigned to that dataset is because of chance alone; IPA=Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Fig. 4 -Molecular and cellular functions that were most significantly different across the three data sets corresponding to proteins identified in soluble (blue), membrane (lighter blue) and both (darker blue) fractions according to Ingenuity software [25] in nasal epithelial cell. The bars represent the biological functions identified, the x-axis identifies it. The y-axis shows the \u2212log of the P value calculated based on Fisher's exact test. The dotted line represents the threshold above which there are statistically significantly more genes in a biological function than expected by chance. Fig. 5 -Schematic representation of the most important ion transport systems in the airway epithelium. The airway surface fluid (ASF) is the fluid in which cilia moves to enable mucociliary clearance. The correct depth of ASF is maintained by regulated absorption and secretion of ions and water. The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the Na + /K + ATPase membrane proteins are involved in Na + absorption. The TMEM16A (also known as anoctamin 1) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) on the apical membrane and the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC) on the basolateral membrane are involved in Ca 2+ -and cAMP-mediated Cl-secretion, respectively. The inward Na + gradient established by plasma membrane Na + /K + -ATPase pumps also propels the countertransport of H + by sodium/proton exchanger (NHE) which along with bicarbonate cotransporters extrude the excess of acid accumulated by cellular metabolism and by various H + (acid equivalents) leak pathways conducts to intracellular pH maintenance.",

In particular, ABCC1 (also known by MRP1, Multidrug Resistance Protein 1) is highly expressed mainly at the basolateral side of bronchial epithelial cells, namely ciliated and goblet cells. This is consistent with our data where a high number of unique peptides were detected for this protein (Table SD1 ). MRP1 confers resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents including vincristine, daunorubicin and methotrexate. Physiological substrates for MRP1 are e.g., leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and glutathione disulfide. Interestingly, these substrates play an important role in lung physiology with respect to inflammation and oxidative stress [37] . ABCC3 (or MRP3) gene is the closest MRP1 homologue. Its product is involved in resistance against the anti-cancer drugs etoposide, teniposide and at higher concentrations also to methotrexate. The physiological function is still unknown for ABCC4 (or MRP4). They may serve as an efflux pump of nucleosides cAMP and cGMP at low affinity, likely in a GSH-independent manner, having thus different substrate specificities. In summary, expression levels of these transporters at airway epithelium, in particular in NE, should be crucial for detoxification and might have implications in therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases.",

Two proteins, flotilin 1 and 2 (FLOT1 and FLOT2) known as structural molecules for caveolar support were also identified. Curiously, caveolin-1 (CAV1) was only observed after reducing previously described criteria. According to some evidences, flotilins are involved in an alternative noncaveolin-dependent mechanism for structural support of caveolae [44, 45] . Whether our observation reflects the predominance of flotilins over caveolin-1 in NE or it is the artifact of the sample preparation remains to be elucidated.",

Glutathione is one of the most powerful endogenous antioxidants, protecting molecules by conjugating with hydrogen peroxide to yield water and oxygen via glutathione peroxidase (GPX1). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is then regenerated to GSH by NADPH via glutathione reductase (GSR). NFR-2 [Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2] is a transcription factor that regulates the antioxidant response [54] [55] [56] by inducing expression of genes involved in combating oxidative stress and activating the body's own protective response. Examples of these are glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), a family of cytosolic, mitochondrial and microsomal enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of GSH with both endogenous and xenobiotic electrophiles which members GSTA1, GSTK1, GSTO1 and GSTP1 were identified here, along with the glutamatecysteine ligase (GCLC), an enzyme involved in the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of GSH. GST and GCLC are induced by NFR-2 activation and represent an important route to eliminate potentially harmful and toxic compounds while balancing redox state of a cell [57, 58] . This result is in agreement with higher proportion of identified proteins involved in drug and xenobiotics metabolism (ALDH5A1, ALDH7A1, ALDH9A1, CAT, CES1, CES2, GCLC, GSTA1, GSTO1, GSTP1, HSP90AB1, NQO1, PPP2R1A). All these proteins are involved in the maintenance of an adequate oxidant/antioxidant balance in NE cells, playing a decisive role in ameliorating the oxidative stress and protect the airways against hostility and injury promoted by the environment. Accumulation of ROS with concomitant attack to cellular membranes might compromise cellular structure maintenance and tissue integrity, therefore combating oxidative stress is a critical and vital function in this tissue. A slight enrichment of DNA replication, recombination and repair functions in soluble fraction was also observed (Table SD4b) , which in conjugation with oxidative stress response machinery, may orchestrate a particular proteinaceous environment propitious to cellular division in accordance with the rapid turnover and regeneration of NE.",

Proteins such as ACTN1, ACTR2, ACTR3, ARPC2, ARPC3 and ARPC4 but also CFL1, GSN, MSN, MYL6, MYL12A, PPP1CA, TMSB4X, VCL and ARHGDIA illustrate this result. Most of these cytoskeleton constituents are involved in cellular assembly, organization and Rho-dependent movement, biological processes also enriched in the soluble fraction subproteome. In fact, members of the Rho GTPase family have been shown to regulate many aspects of intracellular actin dynamics [62] , acting like molecular switches of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell polarity or vesicular trafficking. They also participate in the formation of the lamellipodia and filopodia, by encouraging actin retraction [63] , fundamental to cellular movement and wound healing. Corroborating this outcome was the identification of several subunits of the ARP2/3 complex (ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC4, ACTR2, ACTR3), proteins present at the microfilaments junctions that help to create the actin meshwork [64] . Observation of the mentioned proteins substantiates their part in the maintenance of an architectural structure that fits the function of the epithelium.",

Recently, the developed identification-based algorithms that include the emPAI have shown a high correlation with the actual protein amount in complex mixtures with a wide dynamic range [19] . Although the emPAI accuracy is inferior to absolute quantification using synthesized peptide standards, it is effective in providing the information of protein abundances within the proteome of interest. We used emPAI to estimate protein content in NE, expressed in molar percentages for each identified protein (% mol), highlighting here the top 100 most abundant proteins in both subproteomes (Table SD5a /b).",

Mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins are highly represented among the top 100 most abundant proteins, being more predominant in membrane fraction, as referred before. This observation is illustrated by the identification of several subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, involved in energy production and ATP metabolism, and also structural ribosomal constituents, namely several members of the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome. Components of cytoskeleton such as keratins, among others, also belong to the top 100 most abundant proteins in nasal epithelium cells. We observed on both NE fractions type II (KRT1, KRT5, KRT7, KRT8) and type I keratins (KRT10, KRT18, KRT19). High abundance of keratins is in agreement with their known importance as structural stabilizers of epithelial cells given their polimerization into keratin filaments. Intracellularly, they braid the nucleus, span through the cytoplasm and are attached to the cytoplasmic plaques of the desmosomes. Thus, it seems that they are inherent part of the continuum of stability from the single cell to the tissue formation [67] . Identification of tubulin isoforms (TUBB2A and TUBA1A) among the most abundant proteins (mNE), is in accordance with its role in airway epithelium as building blocks of cilia of tall columnar cells besides being important components of cytoskeleton microtubules [68] .",

By comparing that data (160 proteins in total) with our own (1482 proteins), we observed only 61 commonly proteins identified, confirming that 2D-PAGE is a complementary tool in proteomics although limitative (Fig. 6 ) [71] . Out of the studies describing the microenvironment of human nasal epithelium based on nasal lavage fluid analysis, a comprehensive investigation of this human sample was performed by Casado et al.(2005) , using capillary LC coupled to an ESI-Q-TOF MS equipment as an approach to produce a profile of proteins in NLF from healthy subjects [70] . From the 67 IPA mapped-proteins described in Casado's work, 43 proteins were highlighted in our own work (results not shown).

In the last study, Steiling and co-workers used bronchial epithelial cells harvested by brushing the mainstream bronchus to investigate molecular changes induced by tobacco exposure on a transcript and protein level. Data coming from protein profiling was extracted (859 proteins) for further comparison with NE proteome herein obtained (1482 proteins). IPA's comparison revealed that about 540 proteins are commonly expressed in both airway epithelia (Fig. SD4 , details available in Table SD7 ). Despite using a 1D-PAGE-LC-MS/MS strategy, which is compatible with membrane analysis, the nature of these overlapping proteins is mainly soluble and the major molecular function associated to this group of proteins is catalytic activity, including oxireductase and hydrolase activities. Among these, several proteins are annotated in HPRD as being expressed in respiratory system (e.g., nasal and bronchial epithelium, lungs and bronchoalveolar fluid) as is the case of PLUNC protein, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and aldehyde dehydrogenase 3B1, annotated as being expressed in bronchial epithelial cells, airway epithelia and lung, respectively.

This is also the case of two key proteins, previously described in cystic fibrosis mouse model by our group [78] , retinal dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) along with ADH7, which were found to be crucial enzymes in retinoic acid metabolism, a hormone known as important regulator of organ development and homeostasis, including the lung [79] . Expression of ALDH1A1 in airway epithelium has already been confirmed by in situhybridization of embryonic lung [80] . As recently referred by Bossi and Lehner [81] , these proteins might fall on the group of \"universally expressed housekeeping proteins\", which brings the clinical proteomics field to the future challenge of, not only completing characterization of each cell type that comprise airway epithelium, but also most importantly, defining particular interactions that can occur in that tissue that could be associated with the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases such as asthma, CF and COPD.",

Although nasal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum have been extensively used to assess airway physiology, they mainly provide secreted and tissue leakage molecules that may not effectively reflect tissue/cellular events. Here, we present the most complete proteome profiling of NE to date. We employed an improved subcellular fractionation method followed by a high sensitive multidimensional protein identification technology unraveling mechanisms and processes intimately correlated with normal and pathological lung function. Most of the identified NE proteome overlaps with the previously described ones for bronchial epithelia providing extra consistency related to the usefulness of these cells in lower airways epithelia research. The exhaustive NE proteome data achieved here might be useful for further studies aimed to better understanding of molecular features underlying chronic respiratory diseases using non-invasive and easily collectable specimens that are physiologically and molecularly similar to those on lower airways. Supplementary data associated with this work can be found in the online version. The list of proteins and corresponding peptides identified by the shotgun approach is available in Table SD1 . Annotation of proteins considered positively identified (proteins identified in three independent experiments, with more than one unique peptide) was performed independently using HPRD, IPA and UniProtKb and is available in Table SD2 . Table SD3 provides results of hydrophobicity analysis. Protein data analysis performed by IPA was exported to Table SD4 . Protein abundance analysis is available on Table SD5 . Comparison of our data, performed by IPA, with other proteomes, namely nasal epithelia and bronchial epithelium, is available in Table SD6 and SD7, respectively.",
