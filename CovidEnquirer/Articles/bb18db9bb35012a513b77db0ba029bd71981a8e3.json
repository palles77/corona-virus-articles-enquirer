Each spherical viral particle is approximately 70 nm in diameter and is comprised of a strand of genomic RNA, encapsidated by capsid (C) proteins, surrounded by a host cell-derived lipid bilayer spiked with heterodimers of envelope proteins E1 and E2. 4 The other two structural proteins, 6K and E3, are leader peptides for E1 and E2, respectively, and are not observed in abundance in the mature virion. 4",

Anti-CHIKV antibodies directed against the envelope protein that neutralize the virus in vitro also protect neonatal mice from lethal CHIKV infection in vivo, suggesting that these proteins may be important antigenic lethal targets for development of naturally acquired, or vaccine-elicited protection. [5] [6] [7] EPIDEMIOLOGY The earliest report of chikungunya fever described an outbreak of a dengue-like illness that occurred in 1952 to 1953, on the Makonde Plateau in the Southern Province of Tanganyika (present day Tanzania). 8 Residents of all ages experienced a febrile illness with rash and arthralgia. However, certain aspects of this outbreak distinguished it from previous reports of dengue fever outbreaks. Most striking was the severity of the arthralgia that \"would prevent the sufferer from changing position without help.\" 8 The local population began to call the disease chikungunya, which is a Makonde (Bantu) term that means \"that which bends up,\" referring to the contorted positions of those who were affected by the sudden and severe onset of arthralgia. Additionally, many individuals affected with the disease continued to experience intermittent joint pains that persisted for months after the acute illness. The attack rate also seemed to be unusually high, often affecting entire households. Between 1952 and 1953, an estimated 60% to 80% of the population in this region developed symptoms of fever, rash, and arthralgia. 8 Attempts to isolate the pathologic agent from symptomatic individuals during the outbreak also diverged from previous experience with dengue virus (DENV): Inoculation of infant mice with serum samples from symptomatic individuals resulted in death of the animals. In contrast, DENV infection is difficult to establish in mice. 9 These data suggested that the cause of the syndrome termed chikungunya indeed was distinct from the cause of dengue fever.",

The outbreaks occurred after periods of large rainfall and associated surges in the arboreal Aedes mosquito density. In contrast, CHIKV outbreaks in Southeast Asia occurred in larger cities where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were implicated as the primary transmission vector.

For example, an epidemic \"break-bone fever,\" which referred to modern-day dengue fever, erupted on the islands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz in the West Indies from 1827 to 1828. Stedman, who reported this \"anomalous disease\" called \"dandy fever\" by local residents, noted that the illness \"attacked almost every individual in the town,\" had \"extremely low mortality,\" and was associated with \"pains in the joints for weeks after recovery from the acute stage,\" which were key differences between the 1827 and 1828 West Indies epidemic and previous descriptions of a \"break-bone fever\" (referring to modern-day dengue fever). He concluded that \"the diseases, though somewhat alike in a few symptoms, are essentially different.\" 20 Thus, although the 2013 epidemic was the first CHIKV outbreak in the Americas to be confirmed using modern-day virologic methods, historical reports raise questions to whether this truly was the first introduction of CHIKV infection to the Americas. 21 ",

Lymphocytes and monocytes seem resistant, yet macrophages seem susceptible to CHIKV infection. 26 Investigations of disease pathogenesis during human CHIKV infection have been limited, in part, by the lack of relevant and/or accessible models of CHIKV disease. Development of nonhuman primate models of CHIKV infection has been helpful for use in evaluating potential CHIKV vaccines. Rhesus macaques immunized with an investigational CHIKV virus-like particle vaccine were protected against developing viremia after intravenous challenge with 10 10 PFU of CHIKV, whereas control monkeys that received the mock vaccine developed high levels of viremia after challenge. 29 In a separate study, cynomolgus macaques challenged with a much lower CHIKV inoculum, by either intravenous or intradermal injection, developed viremia, fever, and rash. Viral RNA remained detectable in synovial and muscle tissue for up to 1.5 months after infection, and in lymphoid tissue for up to 3 months. 30 Thus, this model may be useful for studying long-term sequelae of CHIKV infection, such as the prolonged arthralgia experienced by many CHIKV individuals.",

These mice developed viremia, and histologic examination revealed large mononuclear cell infiltrates in and around synovial membranes, and in muscle tissue.

Sudden onset of high fever is typically the initial symptom reported and can appear within 2 days of infection. A rash sometimes is observed and is typically maculopapular, although bullous rashes have been noted in some infants with CHIKV infection. 33 Both viral infections also are known to cause arthralgia and arthritis. However, the polyarthralgia caused by CHIKV frequently is characterized as debilitating and has been reported to continue well beyond the resolution of fever. For example, a third of travelers to the Caribbean who acquired CHIKV infection in 2014 while abroad reported persistent joint or muscle pain, or joint swelling at greater than or equal to 9 months after their acute infection. 34 The knees are the most commonly involved joints; however, other large or small joints may be affected. Of note, symmetric involvement of joints is frequently reported. 35 Additional symptoms reported include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and conjunctivitis. Conspicuously absent among those with CHIKV infection are reports of retro-orbital headache, which are characteristic of dengue fever. 8 Most symptoms resolve within 7 to 10 days; however, many infected individuals have reported protracted arthralgia that has lasted weeks, months, or even years. This long-term burden of disease can be devastating to local economies and represents a significant health cost: CHIKV was responsible for 1386 to 1,081,962 nondiscounted years of life lost in 2005. 36 These values are now significant underestimations of the true health cost burden, given its expanding distribution to the Americas since those estimates were made.",

This is especially important if conditions conducive to an epidemic are present, such as during the rainy season when the mosquito population is high, and with open housing conditions that enhance exposure of an immunologically naive population to infection. Diagnosis of a significant number of cases early on to establish cause of an epidemic and the characteristic symptoms enables reliable clinical diagnosis with decreased need for laboratory confirmation if an epidemic occurs. Public health departments may occasionally perform epidemiologic testing for evidence of past CHIKV infection in a community so that the immunologic history and state of susceptibility in a population are determined to better approximate risk for an outbreak.",

For diagnostic confirmation of current and recent infection, a molecular test (typically polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) for the virus and an assay for the presence of specific IgM antibody are required. The most frequently needed assay is the CHIKV IgM antibody assay. Molecular testing for the presence of the virus is required in the early stages of disease. Virus is present in the blood at the time symptoms appear and PCR testing provides reliable detection for 5 days thereafter (6 days total). During that time only a molecular test for the virus should be ordered. As IgM production rises, by Days 7 to 9, viremia falls to PCR undetectable levels. During Days 5 to 9 when the viral load is waning and IgM has not reached its peak, it is necessary to order a molecular test for the virus and the IgM antibody assay to maintain good diagnostic sensitivity. After that, only the IgM test is required. After 14 to 21 days both the IgM and IgG test are positive, and the IgM test wanes over several weeks or months, whereas IgG remains for years as a good marker of past infection and immunologic protection, and also as an epidemiologic tool to determine seroprevalence in a population.",

Although all 112 had classic symptoms, only 101 were found to be positive by at least one of these laboratory tests. In the 101 samples, IgM outperformed PCR: 92% were positive by IgM, 17% were positive by PCR, and 9% were positive by both.
