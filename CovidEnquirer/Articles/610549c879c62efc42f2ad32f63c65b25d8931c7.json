Hypertension (63 [26.5%]), diabetes (25 184 [10.5%]), and cardiovascular disease (24 [10.1%]) were the most common coexisting 185 disorders.

            "text": "217especially in the early stage of the disease, we tried to analyze the positive rates of218    ELISA and RT-PCR assays in the different stages of disease. To this end, each patient 219 was assigned to different days after initial onset of symptoms based on the time when 220 the pharyngeal swab specimen was detected to be positive or the last recoded 221 detection was still negative, or the blood was collected. The positive rates of viral222    RNA, IgM and/or IgG were compared in every day after initial onset of symptomsTable 2). Due to a small number of samples in each individual day, we pooled the 224 samples in which the positive rates were similar in consecutive days. Thus, the disease 225 process were divided into five phases of 0-5, 6-10,11-12, 13-15 days and more than 226 16 days after initial onset of symptoms(Table 3 &Fig.2). The data showed that 227 positive rates of IgM and/or IgG were very low in the first five days after initial onset 228 of symptoms because there was no antibody produced in most of patients in this early 229 stage, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. Day 11 after initial onset 230 of symptoms is a key time point because the positive rates of IgM and/or IgG jumped 231 to above 80% from less than 50% at this time point. The dynamic pattern is consistent 232 with SARS-CoV infection. 21 On the contrary, the real-time RT-PCR was rate of viral RNA detected by RT-PCR was maintained above 60% in the 235 first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased with the rapid 236 increase of positive rate of antibodies. These results demonstrated that ELISA-based 237 IgM and/or IgG detection should be used as a major viral diagnostic test for the 238 patients with symptoms for more than 10 days. Because about 50% 239 clinically-suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be 240 positive by ELISA-based IgM and/or IgG detection (Table 4), the combination of 241 ELISA and RT-PCR assays will greatly improve the detection efficacy, of the recently emerged novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a 246 challenge for public health laboratories, especially for clinical laboratories of the 247 hospitals in Wuhan, China. Although serological assay is a frequently used method for 248 viral infection screening and diagnosis, there are few reports about serological assay 249 in detection of SARS-CoV-2 up to now. In this study, we report the application of the 250 SARS-CoV-2 N protein-based ELISA for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in the 251 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The 252 results showed that the positive rates of IgM and IgG were significantly higher than 253 that of viral RNA detected by real-time RT-PCR on the pharyngeal swab specimens of 254 all enrolled patients. This result is further supported by the fact that the study, the serum samples were collected in a time period of 9 days from 259 the patients in different stages of disease. The positive rates of nucleic acid test and 260 serological assay in total populations cannot reflect their diagnostic value in 261 surveillance and control of the disease, because the production of antiviral antibodies 262 will decrease the positive rates of the nucleic acid test as the disease progresses. In 263 order to objectively determine the disease stage of the patients, we used the initial 264 onset of symptoms of the patients as the start time point. Based on the day when the 265 test sample was collected, all patients were defined to the different stages of disease. 266 The resulted dynamics patterns of positive rates of viral RNA and antiviral antibodies 267 proved the rationality of the disease stage definition. Our analysis identified the 11th 268 day after initial onset of symptoms as a key time point in the disease process when 269 most infected patients produce antiviral antibodies. After this time point, the diagnosis 270 for viral infection should majorly depend on serological assay. Before this time point, 271 nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of 272 serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. 273 According to the rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 274 SARS-CoV-2 currently implemented in China, 20 a confirmed case of COVID-19 275 patients exclusively depends on the positive result of nucleic acid test or virus gene 276 sequencing.
