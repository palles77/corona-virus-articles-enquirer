            "text": "Background: School preparedness for bioevents, such as emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and pandemics, is imperative, but historically has been low. Methods: The Missouri Association of School Nurses members were sent an online survey during the 2013-2014 school year to assess current bioevent readiness. There were 15 and 35 indicators of school disaster and bioevent preparedness, respectively. Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to delineate factors associated with higher school disaster and bioevent preparedness scores. Results: In total, 133 school nurses participated, with a 33.6% response rate. On average, schools had fewer than half of the disaster or bioevent indicators. Disaster and bioevent preparedness scores ranged from 1-12.5 (mean, 6.0) and 5-25 (mean, 13.8), respectively. The least frequently reported plan components included bioterrorism-specific psychological needs addressed (1.5%, n \u00bc 2), having a foodservice biosecurity plan (8.3%, n \u00bc 11), and having a liberal sick leave policy for bioevents (22.6%, n \u00bc 30). Determinants of better bioevent preparedness include perception that the school is well prepared for a pandemic (P \u00bc .001) or natural disaster (P < .05), nurse being on the disaster planning committee (P \u00bc .001), and school being a closed point of dispensing (P < .05). Conclusion: Schools are underprepared for biological events and are not on track to meet state and national biological preparedness goals.",

            "text": "The 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and subsequent importation of cases into other countries have revealed a lack of biological event preparedness in the United States. 1 Although much focus has been given to hospital and health care agency preparedness, biological preparedness in other sectors of society has been under-researched. K-12 schools in particular represent a large, vulnerable population and a common setting for the spread of communicable diseases. 2 Despite the U.S. Department of Education's mandate 3 and the National Association of School Nurses' 4 and American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation 5 that all schools have disaster and biological event preparedness plans, research indicates that many K-12 school nurses lack appropriate disaster training and preparedness, especially in relation to biological events. [6] [7] [8] A nationwide study of U.S. schools and academic institutions was conducted in 2011 to assess their preparedness for natural disasters and pandemics. 6 That study found that schools were poorly prepared for any type of disaster, but pandemic planning was particularly lacking; the average school reported having less than half of the possible pandemic planning components measured. 6 For example, about half of the participating schools reported having a school disaster plan that addresses pandemics, one-third did not provide any student training on infection prevention, and only 4% had conducted an exercise that involved an infectious disease scenario. 6 Since that study was conducted, 2 studies have examined K-12 schools and biological events. One study consisted of an international review of school closure policies and procedures related to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 9 and the other study examined differences across local health department implementation of school-based vaccination clinics. 10 No study has examined the extent to which schools are prepared for natural disasters or pandemics since the nationwide 2011 study. 6 In addition, the 2011 study only examined 17 indicators of pandemic planning, and issues specific to bioterrorism planning, such as having a foodservice biosecurity plan, were not measured in that study. This study's purpose is to conduct an updated, more thorough assessment of Missouri K-12 schools' readiness for disasters, particularly for large-scale biological events, including emerging infectious diseases, bioterrorism, and pandemics.",

The primary study examined only school nurses who completed both a pre-and postintervention survey (n \u00bc 47). The present study uses data from all participating school nurses, regardless of whether they completed only a preintervention survey, postintervention survey, or both (N \u00bc 133). If the nurse only completed 1 survey (pre-or postintervention), that survey was used for analysis (n \u00bc 86); for nurses who completed both a pre-and postintervention survey (n \u00bc 47), only their postintervention survey was included in analysis. This was done to create a cross-sectional dataset representing the 2013-2014 school year. The purpose of this study is to assess the current state of school readiness in follow-up to a 2011 survey that found that many areas of U.S. school disaster preparedness were lacking, especially in relation to pandemic planning. 6 An online survey was administered through Qualtrics (an online survey platform) to school nurses belonging to the Missouri Association of School Nurses (MASN) during the 2013-2014 school year. A recruitment e-mail was sent to MASN, who forwarded the link to members. Two follow-up recruitment e-mails were sent, 2 and 4 weeks after the initial e-mail, to maximize response rates. Nurses were asked to consult with the school disaster planner or administrator in charge of the school plan when completing the survey, if needed (ie, if they were not familiar with the plan). The Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board approved this study.",

Perfect attendance policies do not contribute to school preparedness because they could encourage ill individuals to go to school while contagious, which could contribute to disease spread. 16 Similar to previous research, 6 this study found that most K-12 schools are poorly prepared for biological events. On average, schools reported having less than half of the measured indicators of preparedness. This study greatly expanded on the single previous study 6 that measured school readiness for pandemics. In particular, this study assessed school readiness for bioterrorism and outbreaks of emerging pathogens in addition to focusing on pandemics and found a general lack of preparedness for biological events. It is vital that schools become better prepared for all types of biological events. Just in the last year, the United States has experienced multiple outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases that have occurred primarily among school-aged children and young adults, including measles 17 and mumps. 18 Other outbreaks and biological events during the last year, such as the importation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola, have also had a strong impact on the United States, although less so on schools than health care agencies and public health. Should an outbreak of an emerging pathogen take hold in the United States, especially if it is a respiratory spread disease, it is likely that school settings will aid in disease transmission because of the close proximity of students. 2, 19 It is vital that schools work toward better readiness for biological events.",

            "text": "School nurses' perceptions about schools being better prepared for natural disasters versus biological events reflect actual preparedness as measured by this study, in that schools are better prepared for natural disasters than events involving an infectious disease. Interestingly, nurses reported equal agreement in the importance of school preparedness for both natural disasters and biological events. These findings indicate that although nurses believe it is important for the school to prepare for biological events, they correctly perceive that little is being done in this area to improve readiness. A general comparison between the similar 2011 school pandemic preparedness study 6 and this study is useful because both compared 8 of the same biological event preparedness components. In both, schools were found to be lacking in all 8 categories at almost the same rate. For example, 56.3% of school nurses said they reported syndromic surveillance data to their local health department in the 2011 study, 6 whereas 49.6% of nurses in this study indicated that their school reports syndromic surveillance data. Almost half (47.8%) of the nurses in the 2011 study reported that the school plan addresses pandemics, 6 whereas 34.6% in the current study indicated that the school plan addresses all biological events, such as bioterrorism, pandemics, and emerging pathogens. These findings imply that Missouri schools do not appear to be making much progress for biological event preparedness. The exact reasons why schools continue to lag in biological preparedness are unclear. Almost all nurses in this study reported that they are interested in school preparedness, and almost threequarters indicated that they have time to receive this training. However, this study did not differentiate between nurses' interest in school preparedness for natural disasters versus biological events. It is possible that school nurses' interest in preparedness is only in the area of natural disasters or school-related violence and not biological events. One possible explanation is that nurses do not know how to better prepare their school for biological events or know where to obtain that information. Two past studies conducted in Missouri found that only 40% of nurses had received any bioterrorism training, 20 83% had not participated in any bioterrorism scenario drills or exercises, 20 and school nurses scored poorly on an objective assessment of bioterrorism-related knowledge. 21 It is not known if the Missouri nurses who participated in the past bioterrorism-related studies also participated in this current study, but it is unlikely that the Missouri school nurse participants in this current study are significantly different from those in the previous studies. Therefore, Missouri school nurses' general lack of bioterrorism knowledge or participation in bioterrorism-related exercises and receipt of little to no bioterrorism training likely have an impact on schools' lag in biological preparedness, especially as it relates to bioterrorism preparedness. Schools can partner with public health to receive training on biological event preparedness. It is also possible that Missouri schools are better prepared than is reported in this study if the nurse participant was unfamiliar with the school plan and did not consult with a planner or administrator when completing the questionnaire. Future school preparedness studies should consider incorporating school administrators' awareness, knowledge, and perceptions related to biological event preparedness because these individuals can have great influence over disaster planning for the institution.",

It is not known if nurses were unaware of the bioterrorism-specific needs for school disaster planning, if they do not know how to address these issues, or if the school disaster planning committee prioritizes other aspects of preparedness. Another possible explanation for the poor school biological event preparedness is that school administrators or school nurses may prioritize readiness for greater perceived threats, such as an active shooter, versus infectious diseases. Future studies need to examine this issue more closely to determine the reasons for the discrepancy between perceived importance for school biological disaster readiness and actual poor preparedness for these events. Studies using a qualitative methodology may be particularly useful to flesh out these issues.",

Numerous researchers have emphasized the important role schools will play in meeting student and staff psychological needs during and after disasters. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Bioterrorism, in particular, is believed to pose unique psychological challenges because of the nature of such an event: the uncertainty of contaminated areas or human exposures after a covert release and the potential for disease spread if a contagious agent is used. 23, 26 For example, mass panic was experienced in multiple schools in the weeks after the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism attack. 26 Children and adolescents are at increased risk for severe illness and posttraumatic stress disorder after a bioterrorism attack, and they spend >80% of their waking hours at school. 25 Researchers have also asserted that school nurses need to be able to identify students needing referral for treatment to address the psychological effects of a bioterrorism attack. 24 For all of theses reasons, it is essential that schools address the psychological needs of students and staff as part of disaster planning, especially as it relates to biological events. School disaster plans need to be coordinated with mental health professionals. This is likely to be most challenging for elementary schools that often do not have counseling staff on-site. It would be prudent for schools to partner with local public health agencies or mental health community-based organizations that can assist with development of plans to address students' psychological needs. Similar to a 2011 study, 6 approximately half of the school nurses in this study reported being members of their school disaster planning committee. Although this is higher than participation rates reported in a 2005 study, 24 it still means that half of the nurses in this study are not part of their school planning committee. Researchers 27 and the National Association of School Nurses 28 have asserted that it is vital that school nurses be involved in school disaster planning activities. School nurses are often key health care providers to children and adolescents during routine times and are expected to play a major role in pediatric health if a biological disaster should occur. 24 School nurses are also more likely than school administrators to have knowledge about how to prevent disease transmission in the school setting, a vital skill for biological event planning and response. Participation in the school disaster planning committee may also have benefits for the school nurse in the form of higher perceived readiness to respond to a biological event. A 2004 study reported that years of work experience were associated with higher school nurses' perceived readiness to respond to a biological event. 29 That association was not found in this study, but being a member of the disaster planning committee was associated with a higher perceived personal readiness to respond to a pandemic and a higher perceived school preparedness for natural disasters. The 2004 study did not assess participation in school planning committees; therefore, it is not known whether those nurses' work experience included being on a planning committee or not. Regardless, the current study's findings suggest school nurse involvement in school planning has personal and institutional benefits. Interestingly, there was no association between school nurse involvement in school planning and perceived interest in disaster planning or perceived importance of school readiness for natural disasters or biological events. This implies that there may be more opportunities for school nurses to be involved in school planning, something that would benefit the individual and the school. This study found an association between being a member of the school planning committee and perceived administrative support to be involved. Dedicated time for disaster planning would be essential for school nurses to be involved. A potential future intervention would be to increase awareness among school administrators regarding the need and benefits of involving school nurses in school disaster planning.",

            "text": "As with previous research, 6,30 this study found that although most schools offer seasonal influenza vaccine to the nurse, very few schools mandate that the nurse get vaccinated annually. Furthermore, even in the rare situation of a school having a mandatory vaccination policy, nurses are the only school staff to whom the policy applies. No other school staff are mandated to get vaccinated, and about half of all school volunteers are neither mandated nor encouraged to get vaccinated. These findings are not in line with the Healthy People 2020 goal of having 80% of nonhealth care professional adults and 90% of health care professionals receive the influenza vaccine annually. 31 Immunization of school staff against seasonal influenza and other vaccine preventable diseases should be a priority for school districts. This protects not only the school staff from disease, but also reduces sick leave 32 and minimizes disease spread even in nonhospital settings. 33 School administrators should consider implementing a mandatory vaccination policy for nurses and, at a minimum, encourage all other staff to get immunized. Research indicates that having a mandatory vaccination policy and encouraging workers to get vaccinated have a significant impact on vaccine uptake. 30, 34, 35 This would be a simple and cost-effective method of improving school preparedness for biological events. One option for increasing seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among school personnel would be to host a schoolbased immunization clinic. Past research 6 indicates that schools that are planned POD sites, which could include being a vaccine clinic, were more prepared for pandemics than non-POD school sites.",

A few limitations must also be noted. One limitation is that only schools in Missouri were assessed and only those whose nurse belongs to the MASN were invited to participate. Therefore, findings from this study may not be generalizable to all of Missouri or the United States. Only a small number of Missouri school nurses are MASN members, perhaps because of time and cost restrictions; therefore, the findings from this study may be biased toward better-funded schools that cover nurses' MASN membership costs or nurses who prioritize MASN membership who might not be representative of the state as a whole. Second, there may be some responder bias. Characteristics of the nonresponders could not be assessed, a common limitation in survey research. It is likely that nurse respondents were more interested or involved in disaster planning compared with those who chose not to participate. This means that the findings could overestimate school preparedness and affect reported attitudes toward disaster planning assessed in this study. In addition, results pertaining to interest in, and perceived importance of, disaster planning may be artificially inflated because of social desirability bias.",
