The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan was up to 0.943.

            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases are a major challenge in the 21st century. In recent years, worldwide outbreaks of Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused great health and economic losses. [1, 2] The ongoing new coronavirus pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) outbreak is becoming a global public health problem. The COVID-19 outbreak is highly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred in 2003; both outbreaks were caused by new coronaviruses during time periods overlapping with the Chinese Spring Festival. [3] On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee reported 27 cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and many cases were traced to the Wuhan Southern China Seafood Market, which was subsequently closed on January 1, 2020. [4] On January 7, 2020, laboratory tests showed that the pathogen causing the previously unexplained pneumonia was a new type of coronavirus; this pneumonia was then officially named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). [5, 6] The COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan and spread rapidly to other provinces and countries. [7, 8] As of January 30, 2020, a total of 34 provinces and regions in China had reported 9692 cases, and nearly all imported cases were derived from Wuhan in Hubei province. [9, 10] COVID-19 has been defined as a class B infectious disease but has been managed as a class A infectious disease by the Chinese government. Daily case reports are being released, and any omission or concealment is punishable by law. Currently, the number of cases is still increasing, and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak; however, the situation differs from province to province. Information on the temporal and spatial distributions of cases is important for developing targeted treatment and prevention strategies. Because the return peak of Spring Festival travel is approaching, information on the possible changes in the incidence of COVID-19 in different cities will help in better preparation for disease prevention and management. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the temporal and spatial distributions of the early COVID-19 epidemic to reveal the dynamic changes and trends in reported cases. These results will provide valuable information for disease prevention at both the individual and organization levels.",

            "text": "According to the Besag York and Molli\u00e8 (BYM) model, [14] a spatial structure effect is defined by a prior conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure. In this process, a spatial adjacency weight matrix needs to be defined. If adjacent, the weight w ij = 1; otherwise the weight w ij = 0, and the special w ij = 0. Similarly, b 1i is also assumed to follow BYM characteristics. For the time structure effect \u03c5 t , a conditional autoregressive process is used, and the adjacency weight matrix in time is defined. For the over-discrete parameter \u03b5 it , according to Gelman, the normal distribution with a mean value of 0 and a variance of \u03c3 2 \u03b5, is generally assumed and the variance of each parameter obeys Gamma (a, b). [15] Based on this model, through the spatial component s i and its posterior probability, high-or low-risk cities (identified based on the average risk [\u03b1] in the entire study area) can be identified. By calculating the probability that spatial relative risk exp (s i ) is greater than 1, regions can be divided into five categories: those with probability >0.8, 0.6-0.8, 0.4-0.6, 0.2-0.4, and <0.2 are defined as hot spots, secondary hot spots, warm-spots, sub-cold spots, and cold-spots, respectively. Similarly, based on the probability threshold, the differences in these regions can be identified considering the trend over time. Further, based on the probability that exp (b 1i ) is greater than 1, regions can be divided into five categories: cities with an incidence risk probability greater than 0.8 show a trend for a rapid change in risk relative to the overall change, and those with an incidence risk probability between 0.6 and 0.8 show a trend for a greater change in the incidence risk than the overall change. A value between 0.4 and 0.6 indicates that the change in the occurrence risk is the same as the overall risk change; 0.2 to 0.4, that the trend of change in disease risk is lower than the overall risk change; and less than 0.2, that the trend of change in disease risk is much lower than the overall risk.",

            "text": "To obtain a general profile of the case distribution, we first analyzed all the available cases during this COVID-19 outbreak. [16] As shown in Figure 1A , the number of cases remained stable from January 11 to January 15, 2020, and the number of new and cumulative cases increased rapidly after January 16. The first death was reported on January 10, and the number of deaths began to increase rapidly from January 17 onwards, with the cumulative number of deaths reaching 213 on January 30 [ Figure 1B ]. [6] After the nucleic acid assay became available, suspected cases waiting for laboratory confirmation could be diagnosed rapidly. [17] After January 19, the number of suspected cases increased rapidly, and about 40-50% of these suspected cases were then confirmed [ Figure 1C ]. Before January 19, the number of severe cases remained low, but they increased steadily from January 20 onwards [ Figure 1D ]. Because Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and the virus spread throughout the province quickly, we also analyzed the changes in number of cases in Hubei province. On January 9, 41 cases were first reported, and by January 30, 5806 cases had been reported, accounting for 59.91% (5806/9692) of the total cases in China [ Figure 1E ]. The cumulative number of deaths in Hubei province was 204, accounting for 95.77% (204/213) of the total deaths in China [ Figure 1F ]. These data indicated that both the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 disease were the highest in Hubei province. [18] Before January 16, cases were mainly reported in Hubei province. From January 17 onward, the outbreak spread to many provinces and the number of cases increased rapidly. Therefore, our spatial and temporal analyses used data from January 17 to January 30, 2020. The location of each case was extracted from official reports and mapped onto the national map at the city level using ArcGIS. Of the 362 cities, 307 (84.8%, 307/362) had reported cases. In general, the core outbreak area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities had the highest number of cases, followed by cities with a high population that are transportation hubs. Spatial distribution was then analyzed with a Bayesian model using WinBUGS. After nearly 100,000 iterations, the model converged successfully. After the model converged, it was iterated another 110,000 times to obtain parameter estimations. Generally, a ratio close to 1 indicates that the two chain iterative sequences are close, and that the model has a good convergence and is stable [ Figure 2A ]. Using the established model and parameters, hot and cold spots were identified. The results showed that Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan, and Taiwan were hot spots, and Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Chongqing, Hunan, and Guangxi were secondary hot spots.",

As of January 30, the number of cases has exceeded the total number of cases of the SARS-CoV outbreak. [20] Until February 15, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases was 70,533, nearly 10 times that noted during the SARS outbreak. Prevention and control of the outbreak has required concerted action from the whole population of China. Although all individuals have participated in the campaign against the outbreak, people in areas with a low number of cases assumed that they were safe from the disease. Therefore, awareness of high-risk regions is important for preparing individuals, particularly in regions with low incidence. Further, it must be noted that five million persons emigrated from Wuhan to all over the country [21] . We do not know exactly how many of them are virus carriers, and it is impossible to track and diagnose them all. Evidence from previous cases showed that asymptomatic patients in the incubation period are also infectious, making it a greater challenge to track virus carriers. Therefore, isolation at home and less contact with others is the most efficient measure to prevent infection and transmission. To reduce transmission, the Spring Festival holiday has been extended from January 31 to February 2. The opening time for all schools and universities has been delayed, and online teaching programs have been launched. Factories have been required to delay resumption or allow work from home.",

The increase in the number of cases in Jilin, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces also occurred relatively fast [Supplementary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A210].

The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Wuhan increased to 0.943, with the highest coefficient of 0.996 observed between Wuhan and other cities of Hubei provinces [Figure 4E and 4F; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A210]. These data strongly indicated that the number of cases was highly related to population emigration from Wuhan. Although we do not know the exact number of people emigrating from Wuhan, five million is an astonishing number, considering that each individual may be a potential virus carrier. If no control measures were implemented, the number of cases would exponentially increase. Of the five million emigrants, 74.22% emigrated to other cities of Hubei province [Supplementary Table 3, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A210]. Fortunately, 17 cities of Hubei province were under lockdown from January 23 to 26 [Supplementary Table 5, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A210]. After the lockdown of Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, outbreak bursts were prevented, and the number of cases increased steadily but did not show exponential growth. Because the outbreak duration overlaps with the Spring Festival transport waves, large-scale migration will be a strong determinant of the characteristics of this outbreak. We analyzed the migration in the three days before the Spring Festival. The top 50 cities from where emigration occurred before the Spring Festival were mainly located in the south and east of China, with Beijing, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Guangzhou showing the highest emigration, accounting for over 15% of the migration population [Supplymentary Figure 1, http://links.lww.com/CM9/A211].",
