To confuse matters further, we now have examples of nonliving agents that will produce transmissible disease in healthy animals (prions). This third postulate of Koch presumes that each occurrence of an infectious disease has a particular organism that is \"the cause\" of the disease. We must return here to our often-repeated theme that diseases do not have \"a cause,\" and infectious diseases are no exception to the rule that pathogenesis is a multistep process. We have already seen that myocardial infarction results from a multitude of conditions that occur through time. In some cases, the last event is infectious, wherein a focal bacterial endocarditis precipitates a thrombus that blocks a narrowed coronary artery. It would be folly to believe that the sequence of events that lead to a myocardial infarction can be precipitated simply by injecting an organism into an animal. Later in this chapter, we will see two examples of rare infections for which several conditions must prevail before a disease emerges [4, 5] .",

For example, Group A streptococcus infection is considered to be the underlying cause of rheumatic fever. The infection is long gone prior to the appearance of the valvular and endocardial lesions of rheumatic fever. As another example, several species of human papillomavirus are considered to be the underlying cause of nearly all cases of squamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Morphologic cytopathic effects are visible in the earliest precancers that precede the development of invasive carcinoma. The cancers, which may occur years following the early papillomavirus infections, may lack recoverable virus. Let's look at an example of an infectious disease that violates every one of Koch's postulates. Whipple disease, previously a disease of unknown etiology, is characterized by organ infiltration with foamy macrophages (i.e., specialized reticuloendothelial cells that \"eat\" bacteria and debris). The organ most often compromised in Whipple disease is the small intestine, where infiltration of infected macrophages in the lamina propria (i.e., a strip of loose connective tissue subjacent to the epithelial lining of the small intestine) causes malabsorption. Whipple disease is rare. It occurs most often in farmers and gardeners who work with soil.",

Based on molecular features of the ribosomal RNA molecule, the researchers assigned it to Class Cellulomonadacea, and named the species Tropheryma whipplei, after the man who first described the disease, George Hoyt Whipple. Particularly noteworthy, in the case of Whipple disease, is that Koch's postulates never came close to being satisfied. For the experimentalist, the most important of Koch's postulates require the extraction of the organism from a lesion (i.e., from diseased, infected tissue), the isolation and culture of the organism in the laboratory, and the consistent reproduction of the lesion in an animal injected with the organism. In the case of Whipple disease, none of these criteria were satisfied. The consistent identification in Whipple disease tissue of a particular molecule, characteristic of a particular species of bacteria, was deemed sufficient to establish the infectious origin of the disease.",

In susceptible individuals, the organisms multiply within macrophages. When organisms are released from dying macrophages, additional macrophages arrive to feed, but this only result in the local accumulation of macrophages bloated by bacteria. Whipple disease is a good example of a disease caused by an organism but dependent on a genetic predisposition, expressed as a defect in innate immunity; specifically, a reduction of macrophages expressing CD11b (also known as macrophage-1 antigen) [8] . Whipple disease cannot be consistently reproduced in humans or any other animals, because it can only infect and grow in a small portion of the human population.",

In the case of Whipple disease, the infected individual must be exposed to a soil organism, limiting the disease to farmers and gardeners. The organism, residing in the soil, must be ingested, perhaps by the inhalation of dust. The organism must evade degradation by gut macrophages, limiting disease to individuals with a specific type of defect in cell-mediated immunity, and the individual must have disease that is sufficiently active to produce clinical symptoms.

The cells of the body that are most vulnerable to prion-produced disease are the neurons of the brain. The reason for the particular sensitivity of neurons to prion disease relates to the limited ability of neurons to replicate (i.e., to replace damaged neurons with new neurons), and to repair damage occurring in their uniquely long cytoplasmic extensions (e.g., axons).",

Referring to the requirements, we have a large literature in which the transmissibility of prion extracts from human to nonhuman animal, and from nonhuman animal to nonhuman animal has been demonstrated [22, 23] . The prion agents have been extracted and studied. Prions can be examined in growing yeast cultures, and the propagation of prions can be observed in controlled, experimental settings [24] [25] [26] .

The clinical form of the prionopathy that would result from either of these hypothetical mechanisms would be somewhat dependent on how the disease spreads through the brain [31] .

In particular, it has been suggested that the disease known as multiple system atrophy (MSA) with parkinsonism may qualify. MSA is a CNS disorder that develops very slowly, and produces a progressive loss of autonomic nervous system function. In MSA, there is always an accumulating ball of sticky, misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, observed as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in glial cells. In 2015, it was shown that a neurodegenerative disease could be transmitted to transgenic mice expressing normal human alpha-synucleoprotein, after injection with a brain homogenate prepared from human MSA cases [34] . Hence, MSA can be considered a type of prionopathy produced by an altered protein other than PrP(Scr). If we accept that prion diseases can be produced by self-propagating proteins other than PrP(Scr), then what other diseases might we now investigate as potential prion diseases. Without diverting too far from the subject of this book, we can say that there seems to be a newly described class of diseases characterized by misfolded self-propagating and, under some circumstances, transmissible proteins, which may include the prionopathies, the tauopathies (including Alzheimer disease), and the amyloidoses [31, [35] [36] [37] .",

American health-care workers will not soon forget the first US case of Ebola. Thomas Duncan first arrived at the Emergency Room of the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, on the evening of September 25, 2014, complaining of fever, abdominal pain, dizziness, and nausea. After a few hours in the emergency room, Mr. Duncan was discharged with the diagnosis of sinusitis and a prescription of antibiotics. Mr. Duncan returned to the same emergency room 2 days later, much sicker. It turns out that Mr. Duncan had arrived in the United States just days previously, after having resided in Liberia, Africa. This time around, the correct diagnosis of Ebola virus infection was rendered. On October 8, Mr. Duncan died from Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever. Before his death, two health-care workers from the hospital were infected; they were the first to contract Ebola virus infection while on US soil.

Infectious diseases may closely mimic one another, leading the unwary physician to mistakenly apply a common diagnosis to an uncommon infection. For example, Neorickettsia sennetsu causes a rare disease that closely mimics infectious mononucleosis, a common disease caused by the Epstein Barr virus. As another example, patients with HIV/AIDS are susceptible to two different skin conditions that closely resemble one another: bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi sarcoma. Bacillary angiomatosis is an exaggerated overgrowth of small vessels of the skin, produced by infection with species of Bartonella (i.e., B. quintana and Bartonella henhenselae). Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer of vascular origin (i.e., a type of angioscarcoma) that is caused by Herpesvirus-8. Both bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi sarcoma look very similar by gross examination and by microscopic examination with standard histological stains (i.e., Hematoxylin and eosin stains). Both bacillary angiomatosis and Kaposi sarcoma occur in AIDS patients, but their respective prognoses and treatments are very different. The correct diagnosis requires an astute pathologist who understands and anticipates the rare and the common causes of vascular proliferative lesions in immunecompromised patients [Glossary Hematoxylin and eosin].",

Unexpectedly, a small epidemic of S. marcescens infections was reported among the exposed population. In all, 11 individuals required hospitalization and one individual died. No cases of S. marcescens infections had been previously reported in the hospital where the death occurred, and no clusters of S. marcescens infections had occurred following the epidemic that coincided with the navy's experiment. It seems that S. marcescens, though harmless to most individuals, was pathogenic to a tiny subpopulation of the population. Presumably, genetic susceptibility accounted for the shift from harmless organism to deadly pathogen, in at least one hapless victim. At the time, nobody understood why this mini-epidemic had hit San Francisco. It was not until 1976, when the navy experiment was declassified, that the truth came to light.",

Blastocystis hominis was a eukaryotic organism seen as an incidental finding, of no known significance, on stool examinations. For a long time, the proper taxonomic classification of this organism was undetermined, and it has been variously referred to as a yeast, a fungus, an amoeba, a flagellated single-celled eukaryote, or a sporozoan (former name for apicomplexan), at various times [40] . Today, Blastocystis is considered a genus belonging to the heterokonts, and is the only heterokont known to produce a human infection. Infection follows ingestion of the cyst through the fecal-oral route. Most infections do not result in any clinical symptoms, but sometimes, a syndrome mimicking irritable bowel syndrome may occur. Among individuals who have microscopic school examinations, for any reason, up to 25% of specimens contain Blastocystis [41] . Because Blastocystis is found in the stools of healthy individuals, the finding of the organism in the stool of a symptomatic patient does not necessarily establish a causal relationship. Treatment with metronidazole, an antibiotic effective against eukaryotes and prokaryotes, has its advocates [42, 43] , but can we do better? Blastocystis is the only heterokont known to cause disease in humans, and we know almost nothing about the heterokonts that would help us design a drug that would be effective against Blastocystis. Our experience with Blastocystis reminds us that as we may discover pathogens belonging to classes of organisms that were previously thought to be devoid of infectious agents. In such cases, we will need to find new, class-specific antibiotics. Let's look at another example wherein a taxonomic change requires us to develop a new approach to treatment.",

The bacterial organisms that invade via indwelling devices include species of Pseudomonadales, Bacillales, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Legionallales. Despite their taxonomic diversity, all these organisms seem to share an ability to secrete biofilms over surfaces, and to glide through the biofilms they create. Biofilms are invisible, slimy coatings, composed of polysaccharides and cellular debris that provide sanctuary from the antibacterial sprays and solutions used in hospitals. Bacterial species that can glide through a biofilm can track a catheter into the body. For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal organism that lives on human skin.

For example, Plasmodium knowlesi, a known cause of malaria in macaque monkeys, has emerged as a cause of human malaria in Southeast Asia, where it has grown in incidence to the point that it currently accounts for about two-thirds of malarial cases in this region. Malaria is commonly diagnosed with an antigen test developed against the common forms of human plasmodia (e.g., Plasmodium falciparum). Patients with P. knowlesi may have a negative reaction to the standard Plasmodium antigen test [53] . If this were to occur, a P. knowlesi infection may go undiagnosed, and the patient might not be provided with needed antimalarial medication. Careful examination of blood will usually indicate the presence of parasites in the cases of P. knowlesi malaria, and a specific diagnosis can be confirmed with advanced molecular tests.

If the diseases occur primarily in children, and if the disease runs in families, then we can say that, in all likelihood, a strong genetic influence is at work. If the disease causes fever and signs of inflammation and responds to anti-inflammatory medication, then we can infer that the condition involves a primary disorder of the inflammatory system, or a secondary disorder (such as the response to an infection). If the disease arises as an epidemic, then an infection or a newly introduced environmental toxin is likely to blame. Most importantly, if all of the medical research at our disposal is brought to bear on a disease, and no root cause is found, then it's a very safe bet that multiple conditions and events converge to produce the disease, and that a single cause will never be assigned.

This disease is often fatal, and thousands of deaths were reported in its peak incidence years . Knowing that the region with the highest incidence of disease corresponded to a region with selenium deficiency, Chinese authorities treated spring crops with sodium selenite. It worked. The incidence of Keshan disease dropped in the areas where the crops were sprayed [85] . In 1981, a report came out indicating that Keshan disease patients had high levels of antibodies against Coxsackie virus, a virus known to produce cardiomyopathy [85, 86] .

Although the origin of aggregates of misfolded protein in Alzheimer disease is unknown, we see such changes, to some degree, in the brains of virtually every individual who dies at an advanced age. We tend to credit such changes to long-term effects that accumulate in aging (i.e., nonrenewing or postmitotic) cells. Like many of the diseases of unknown origin, there seems to be a genetic component of indeterminate significance.

As a partial remedy for this situation, pathologists have discovered a wide range of subtle clues that may help them distinguish one fungus from another: width of hyphae, angle of hyphal branching, septation of hyphae, the presence or absence of pigment, the size of yeasts and the morphology of budding, the type of host response to the fungal organisms (e.g., granuloma, acute inflammation), the anatomic site of infection, and so on. Clever as they may be, the definitive diagnosis for fungal species is determined in the clinical mycology lab, whenever feasible.

It is possible for one mycologist to observe a fungus that reproduces exclusively asexually, while another mycologist, observing the same species in a culture dish or growing in the wild, may observe sexual reproduction (e.g., fruiting bodies). Depending on the phase of reproduction observed, and ignorant of the existence of an alternate morphologic form, taxonomists have assigned different names (sexual and asexual) to the same organism. Rather than harmonizing a dichotomous nomenclature under one preferred name, the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) had ruled, in the past, that it is acceptable to assign two different binomials to an organism: a sexual (also called teleomorphic, perfect, or meiotic form) and an asexual (also called anamorphic, imperfect, or mitotic form). For instance, two binomials legitimately apply to the same organism: Filobasidiella neoformans (the teleomorphic form) and Cryptococcus neoformans (the anamorphic form). Clinical mycologists typically use the asexual name, because it is the asexual form that grows in human tissues. The unbridled craziness of one species having several different names could not continue forever. The 18th International Botanical Congress assembled in 2011, in Melbourne, Australia decided that a fungus was not a plant, and renamed themselves \"The International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants.\" More importantly, the Congress abolished longstanding provisions permitting separate names for the different morphologic forms of a pleomorphic fungal species (i.e., names for anamorphs and teleomorphs) [92] . The \"One fungus = One name\" rule, as it has come to be known, faces many practical obstacles to its quick implementation. For example, many fungi have never exhibit sexual reproduction in culture. Many other fungi cannot be cultured. A special pseudoclass of fungi, deuteromyctetes (spelled with a lowercase \"d,\" signifying its questionable validity as a true biologic class) has been created to hold these indeterminate organisms until definitive classes can be assigned. Currently, there are several thousand such fungi, sitting in a taxonomic limbo, until they can be placed into a definitive taxonomic class [46] . Still, the \"one fungus = one name\" rule is a step in the right direction, and we can expect that nonmorphologic (e.g., genetic) identifiers of fungal species will eventually lead to a coherent and logical fungal taxonomy.",

Kingdom protozoa was a pseudoclass, consisting of all manner of organisms that were not closely related to one another, and which contained organisms that should have been assigned to separately named classes of single-celled eukaryotic organisms [94] . Many decades passed before taxonomists caught up with the blunder, and reassigned individuals in class protozoa to proper classes of their own. Nonetheless, biologists are unwilling to abandon long-cherished terminology. Taxonomists who should know better have pleaded to retain obsolete and misleading plesionyms, such as \"protist,\" \"protoctista,\" and \"protozoa\" on the grounds that doing so will enhance communication and facilitate teaching [95] .

If the Sauropsids (including future birds and reptiles), and synapsids (including future mammals) belong to Class Amniota, it would seem only fitting to presume that Class Amphibia, whose eggs lack an amnion, would be a subclass of Class Anamniota.

Hence, a sporadic disease has no known cause, and no discernible pattern of occurrence (e.g., neither genetic nor environmental, and without any particular geographic origin). The term \"sporadic\" is fraught with scientific ambiguity and should probably be abandoned altogether. To label a disease \"sporadic\" legitimizes and perpetuates the dubious notion that diseases can occur without cause (e.g., entirely by \"chance\"). Many of the diseases that were considered to be sporadic, decades ago, are now known to have specific causes. Would it not be more accurate to use the phrase \"undetermined pathogenesis\" in place of \"sporadic,\" for occurrences of a disease whose cause is currently unknown?",

With H&E staining, the nuclei of cells are blue, and the cytoplasm is pink. Without staining, cells are colorless (except for those cells that are pigmented, such as melanocytes), and the anatomic parts of the cell (nucleus, cell membrane, nucleolus, brush borders, etc.) cannot be easily distinguished. The development of histologic staining techniques in the 19th century was among the most important advances in medical science. Negative classifier A negative classifier is a feature whose absence is used to exclude an organism from a taxonomic class; it is the riskiest way to assign classes. A species may lack a particular feature because none of its ancestors ever had the feature, as might be the case in a valid lineage of organisms. An example is the Collembola, popularly known as springtails, a ubiquitous member of Class Hexapoda, and easily found under just about any rock. These organisms look like fleas (same size, same shape) and were formerly included among the true fleas (Class Siphonaptera). Like fleas, springtails are wingless, and it was assumed that springtails, like fleas, lost their wings somewhere in evolution's murky past. However, true fleas lost their wings when they became parasitic. Springtails never had wings, an important taxonomic distinction separating springtails from fleas. Today, springtails (Collembola) are not classed with fleas or with any member of Class Insecta. They belong to Class Entognatha, a separate subclass of Class Hexapoda. Alternately, taxonomists may be deceived by a feature whose absence is falsely conceived to be a fundamental property of a class of organisms. For example, Class Fungi was believed to have a characteristic absence of a flagellum. Based on the absence of a flagellum, the fungi were excluded from Class Opisthokonta and were put in Class Plantae, which they superficially resembled. However, the chytrids, recently shown to be a primitive member of Class Fungi, have a flagellum. This places fungi among the true descendants of Class Opisthokonta.

Optimally, the canonical concepts listed in the nomenclature are organized into a hierarchical classification [103, 104] . Problematica The term \"problematica\" is used by taxonomists to indicate a class of organism that defies robust classification [105] . The very existence of this term tells us that taxonomy is a delicate and tentative science. We must always be prepared to examine and test our current classification, and to make corrections wherever warranted. Proximate cause Synonymous with the immediate cause. The proximate cause of a biological event is the closest action that can be held responsible for the cause of the event. For example, the rupture of a blood vessel in the lung may be the proximate cause of death, while an invasive lung cancer may have been the underlying cause of death. The erosion of a vessel by tumor cells was one of the sequence of events leading from the underlying cause of death to the proximate cause of death. The underlying cause of death satisfies the \"but-for\" condition. But for the lung cancer, the vessel would not have eroded, and blood would not have flooded the lung tissue. The proximate cause of death need not be a necessary condition resulting from the underlying cause of death. Had the vessel not ruptured, the individual may have died from an alternate proximate cause (e.g., metastasis, pneumonia). Root cause The earliest event or condition that is known to set in motion a chain of additional events that can result in some specified result. The term \"root cause\" is preferable to another term \"underlying cause\" that is often applied to the same concept. Any of the events that precede a result could be construed as underlying causes. The term \"root cause\" conveys the idea of a first or earliest event in a multievent process. Of course, we can never be certain what the earliest event is in any process. For example, infections from Naegleria fowleri result from exposure to free-living organisms in their natural habitat (pond and river water). The organism travels from the nose to the brain, where it causes a meningoencephalitis. It seems self-evident that Naegleria fowleri is the root cause of Naeglerian meningoencephalitis. Maybe not.",

            "text": "Even in the simplest of cases, it is difficult to assign a root cause with any certainty. We never know if we've looked backwards far enough. Still, we do the best that we can, and we apply the term \"root cause\" with the understanding that we may need to modify our thinking, if evidence of an earlier event comes to light. Serotype Subtypes of a species of bacteria or virus that differ in their surface antigens. Serovar Same as serotype. Unclassifiable objects Classifications create an hierarchical collection of classes, and their taxonomies assign each and every named object to its correct class. This means that a classification is not permitted to contain unclassified objects; a condition that puts fussy taxonomists in an untenable position. Suppose you have an object, and you simply do not know enough about the object to confidently assign it to a class. Or, suppose you have an object that seems to fit more than one class, and you can't decide which class is the correct class. What do you do? Historically, scientists have resorted to creating a \"miscellaneous,\" \"problematica,\" or \"incertae sedis\" (uncertain placement) class into which otherwise unclassifiable objects are given a temporary home, until more suitable accommodations can be provided [105] . Historically, the promiscuous application of \"miscellaneous\" classes has proven to be a huge impediment to the advancement of the biological sciences. In the case of the classification of living organisms, the class of protozoans stands as a case in point. Ernst Haeckel, a leading biological taxonomist in his time, created the Kingdom Protista (i.e., protozoans), in 1866, to accommodate a wide variety of simple organisms with superficial commonalities. Haeckel himself understood that the protists were a blended class that included unrelated organisms, but he believed that further study would resolve the confusion. In a sense, he was right, but the process took much longer than he had anticipated; occupying generations of taxonomists over the following 150 years. Today, the former members of Kingdom Protista have been reassigned to positions among the animals, plants, and fungi. In the meantime, therapeutic opportunities for eradicating the so-called protozoal infections, using class-targeted agents, have no doubt been missed [3] . For practical reasons, textbooks still use the term \"protozoan,\" but strictly speaking, Kingdom Protista no longer exists [95] .",

            "text": "You may think that the creation of a class of living organisms, with no established scientific relation to the real world, was a rare and ancient event in the annals of biology, having little or no chance of being repeated. Not so. A special pseudoclass of fungi, deuteromycetes (spelled with a lowercase \"d,\" signifying its questionable validity as a true biologic class) has been created to hold fungi of indeterminate speciation. Currently, there are several thousand such fungi, sitting in a taxonomic limbo, waiting to be placed into a definitive taxonomic class [3, 46] . Underlying cause The event that initiated the sequence of events leading to some clinical outcome (e.g., disease). Death certificates require physicians to list the underlying cause of death. The World Health Organization, aware of the difficulties in choosing an underlying cause of death, and assigning a sequential list of the ensuing clinical consequences leading to the proximate cause of death, has issued reporting guidelines [106] . Instructions notwithstanding, death certificate data are notoriously inconsistent, giving rise to divergent methods of reporting the diseases that cause death [107] [108] [109] . Reluctantly, we must acknowledge that, in any biological system, we can seldom designate the underlying causes with any certitude. One event may lead to many other events, and events which we believe to be initiating may have their own predicative causes. Vector An organism that moves a disease-causing organism from one host to another. Diseases spread by vectors include malaria, plague, leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, relapsing fever, yellow fever, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus disease, West Nile encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and chikungunya. All arboviruses have arthropod vectors, and there are about 100 known arboviruses that cause human disease [52] . One vector can carry more than one type of infectious organism. For example, a single species of Anopheles mosquito can transmit Dirofilaria immitis, O'nyong'nyong fever virus, Wuchereria bancrofti, and Brugia malayi. Obversely, one disease organism can be spread by more than one vector. For example, orbiviruses are spread by mosquitoes, midges, gnats, sandflies, and ticks.",

Conidia are the propagules of fungi, which are swept into the air and water. It is estimated that humans inhale about 40 conidia, of diverse provenance, every hour. Most human encounters with conidia are inconsequential, but infections or allergic reactions may occur in susceptible individuals.
