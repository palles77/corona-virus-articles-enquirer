When comparing demographical data, recent data from Pernambuco, Brazil show similarities to what we report. Although the age group most frequently affected by ZIKAV-related GBS was patients in their fourth decade, the attack rate was higher in the patients over the age of 60 [5] . Flaviviruses, including dengue virus, have previously been shown to occasionally develop neurological complications [25] [26] [27] [28] . In our 10 patients confirmed with RT-PCR, the most common presentation was ascending weakness with hyporreflexia/arreflexia, consistent with the Brighton criteria for GBS [29] . The time between the appearance of symptoms to neurologic deterioration was 5 days and the neurologic Fig. 3 . Magnetic resonance brain of a confirmed patient (case 4) with diagnosed with encephalitis associated with Zika virus infection showing: hyperintense lesions in frontal and temporal regions bilaterally, additionally subcortical damage can be found predominantly in the right side. These findings are compatible with a diagnosis of encephalitis. nadir was reached in a median of 5 days, consistent with GBS reports of 12 h to 28 days [20, 30] . Nevertheless, the CSF analysis showed 4 patients with pleocytosis, and none with albumin-cytologic dissociation (an increase in CSF protein levels without a corresponding increase in cellular content characteristic of GBS). Previous reports on ZIKAV-GBS showed similar time between onset of viral symptoms and neurological deterioration (6 days). In spite of this, no patient with such presentation was still viraemic at admission, as established by RT-PCR [9, 10] . Whether we are looking at a subset of patients with a different presentation from GBS, is still far from settled [31] .",

This is higher than what has been previously reported both for ZIKAV and other types of GBS [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] .

The scarcity of resources and technological limitations in certain countries, especially during an epidemic, play a major role in determining diagnostic protocols. In addition, the workup for GBS was insufficient, undermining the certainty of diagnosis in some cases. Some data had to be collected retrospectively and even then, key elements may be missing due to the complexity of this nascent international collaboration. Participation in the study was voluntary and unfunded. As such, we do not claim to establish the regional burden of severe ZIKAV infection during the period reported.

In our series, ZIKAV was associated with a spectrum of neurological presentations: most commonly a GBS-like syndrome, but also encephalitis, suggesting more than one potential pathophysiological mechanism. This is important in clinical follow-up of patients suspected with ZIKAV, and when considering etiologies amongst patients presenting with neurologic symptoms. Larger population-based observational studies of patients with ZIKAV are needed to help identify risk factors for severe illness so that we may better counsel patients and prepare the health care system.",
