Visitors perform the Hajj over a period of five or six days, staying in a tent city outside of Mecca. The timing of the Hajj follows a lunar calendar, occurring 10 or 11 days earlier each year according to the Gregorian calendar. From 2011 to 2018, it has moved from early November to mid-August.

As can be seen in Fig. 2 , the mass gathering population is maximized approximately between day 15 and day 48 each year. Thus, the mass gathering event occurs during the height of the transmission season if \u03c4 \u2208 [15, 48].

We do this for four different values of \u03c4 corresponding to holding the mass gathering event when the contact rate is maximized, and with phase shifts of 3, 6 and 9 months. In each case, \u03f5 is varied from 0 (corresponding to no seasonality) to 0.4 (corresponding to minimums and maximums in the contact rate that are 40% lower and higher than the average value). We find that if the mass gathering occurs when the contact rate is maximized (red curve), then 0 increases linearly with \u03f5. On the other hand, if the mass gathering occurs when the contact rate is minimized (blue curve), then 0 decreases linearly with \u03f5. If the mass gathering occurs half-way between these times (green and black curves), then the effect on 0 of varying \u03f5 (even quite significantly) is negligible. This is likely due to the fact that the contact rate is near its mean during these periods, and so varying \u03f5 has very little impact on the contact rate until after the gathering has concluded. (We note that all four curves show the same value of 0 vs \u03c4. This demonstrates that 0 is a function of the difference \u03c4 between the time of the peak in disease transmissibility and the time that travel to the mass gathering begins, with the mass gathering occurring principally between days 15 and 48. Fig. 3 , that it is better to hold mass gatherings when the seasonal infectiousness is minimized. For a recurring mass gathering for which the timing is not easily adjusted, such as the Hajj, Fig. 3 suggests that preparation for disease outbreaks should be increased in years when the gathering takes place at a time of elevated seasonal infectiousness.",

In our simulations, the functions \u03d5 2 , \u03d5 3 and \u03d5 4 are identical, and differ from \u03d5 1 by a constant multiplicative factor. These functions give a short period during which individuals move to the mass gathering event, as shown in the figure. Integrating \u03d5 j gives the approximate total number of attendees from location j. (The number is approximate since infectives travel at a reduced rate, determined by the parameter k 0.4 i = .) This gives a total size for the mass gathering of slightly over 2 million individuals. The functions \u03b8 j are identical for j 1, 2, 3, 4 = and represent the per capita return rate to location j. Thus, the long period at which \u03b8 j is at its maximum corresponds to exponential decay in the number of attendees from location j. The functions \u03d5 j and \u03b8 j are taken to be periodic with a period of 365 days so that the mass gathering event is periodic.

Fig. 5 shows that it can be possible to avoid an outbreak (i.e. keep 0 less than 1) by dissuading individuals from travelling to the event, possibly by restricting travel. Fig. 6 (a) shows the effect of simultaneously varying\u00afj for j 1, 2, 3, 4, = from 0.1 to 0.6. (The other simulations used a value of 0.3.) We require that\u00afj be strictly greater than zero; otherwise, attendees from region j would never return home. Smaller values of\u00afj mean that the mass gathering attendees return home more slowly, extending the duration of the event. Thus, it is expected that 0 is a decreasing function of\u00af, j as is apparent in Fig. 6(a) . From the figure, for the parameters in Tables 1 and 2, it seems unlikely that 0 can be reduced below 1 simply by increasing\u00afj. It should be noted, though, that the function \u03b8(t) only becomes non-zero when t b 42 0 > = ; thus the effect of increasing\u00afj is to prevent attendees from lingering longer after the main event has concluded. In Fig. 6(b) , we see how 0 depends on the mass action coefficient mm S for disease transmission at the mass gathering. If disease transmissibility at the event is low, then 0 does not significantly depend on mm S as seen by the fact that the curve is quite flat. However, as mm S grows, we enter a region where there is apparent linear growth in the basic reproduction number. This suggests that it is prudent to implement policies that reduce transmission at the mass gathering, however, at some point further effort in reducing transmission at the mass gathering has minimal impact; at this point it is likely better to put resources elsewhere.",

            "text": "What about latency? Thus far, we have not discussed the impact that a period of latency (between the time of infection and the beginning of infectiousness) might have on our analysis. For many models, if the average life expectancy in the absence of disease is , \u00b5 1 then the inclusion of latency with an average duration of 1 reduces 0 by a factor of \u00b5 + . Since this duration of latency is typically much shorter than life expectancy, this fraction is typically quite close to one and so the effect on 0 is small. For our model, however, the result is quite different. Here, the value of 0 is highly dependent on transmission that takes place during the mass gathering. A period of latency can significantly cut into the duration of the mass gathering, resulting in a larger reduction in 0 . In Fig. 8 , we present the analog of Fig. 3 , showing how 0 varies with \u03c4 (the offset between the peak in transmissibility and the beginning of movement to the mass gathering) for a variant of our main model that includes a period of latency that lasts an average of two days. There seems to be an approximately 30% reduction in 0 when the mass gathering happens at peak transmissibility and an approximately 20% reduction in 0 when the mass gathering happens at the minimum transmissibility. The difference in reduction is likely due to the difference in how much of the next generation of infections occur at the mass gathering for the different values of \u03c4. This shows that future work should take full account of latency. ",
