This heat radiation from the body surface can be detected through the use of a thermal imaging camera. Ring et al. has presented in detail the physics behind infrared thermal imaging in Ref. [8] . Thermal infrared imaging works by capturing the infrared radiation emitted from various regions of the body as temperature readings spontaneously. Every part of the body has a specific thermal pattern associated with it based on the microcirculation near skin surface. Thus thermal imaging can be used to monitor the changes in the temperature profile of a particular region with respect to time.",

[11] . A typical diagnostic system using medical infrared thermography, image processing, and soft computing is shown in Fig. 4 . An IR thermal image captures the infrared energy radiated from the surface of the skin or any other object above absolute zero. The salient feature of thermography is its ability to image the thermovascular appearance of the skin and not the structure and anatomy of the human body which is done by many other medical imaging modalities. Jones and Plassman [12] details the journey of the improvements in thermal imagers, how an IR image is formed, processed, and analyzed for detective the changes in response to different stimuli like cool temperatures. Izhar in his thesis [13] describes the registration and analysis of thermal images in medicine. Oliver Faust et al. [14] have given a review of algorithms used for computer aided diagnosis systems using thermography. But most of these do not make use of soft computing techniques for the processing of the infrared thermal images. Herry and Frize in their work [15] present techniques to de-noise the infrared images, to remove the background from the infrared images to identify the regions of interest and statistical analysis of the ROIs to classify normal and abnormal temperatures.

Diabetic foot complications are a major cause of concern for diabetic patients as it affects mobility and quality of life. At present, any patient suffering from diabetes for five or more years in the case of type 1 diabetes and patients diagnosed with type 2 should undergo foot evaluation to prevent any foot complication such as ulcer or peripheral neuropathy. This requires the patient to visit the foot evaluation clinic in regular periods usually 3 months in the case of at risk patients, 6 months with patients involving other diabetic complications and peripheral arterial disease and 1 year for regular foot evaluation. This is cumbersome looking at the money and time involved. Many patients avoid or ignore the visit. This later converts to foot or toe amputation which can be avoided if computer aided diagnosis system is available at home as an app in mobile or for telemedicine purposes. For such a system, image processing has to be done automatically and abnormality has to be detected immediately that suggests treatment or visiting the clinic. This is where machine learning comes into play as image processing for the extraction of abnormal regions, grading the level of complication and for decision making to suggest further action such as suggesting the patient to visit the foot evaluation clinic and get the treatment done or later for telemedicine. Hence we studied the surface temperature distribution (STD) patterns in the plantar foot of both diabetic and healthy subjects to establish the differences in temperature capable to early diagnosis of the complication and we are looking forward to building a diagnostic system to detect and assess diabetic foot complications early to prevent amputation.",

            "text": "Bagavathiappan et al. [17] have studied the correlation between diabetic neuropathy and plantar foot temperature proving the capability of thermography in detecting diabetic neuropathy. Br\u00e5nemark et al. [18] observed the temperature distribution patterns of hands and feet for both nondiabetic and diabetic subjects. Bharara et al. [19] formed a healing wound index based on the thermal profile of foot wound of diabetic patients. This helps in studying the healing pattern of the diabetic foot complication to suggest treatment. Peregrina-Barreto et al. [20] studied the temperature pattern of diabetic patients and have analyzed the same using angiosome concept. They have divided the entire foot into four regions corresponding to four angiosomes, a concept derived by Nagase et al. Estimated temperature difference between the left and right foot was calculated to carry out the analysis. Also, the classification of the thermal patterns is done for each of the four regions based on seven classes derived. They concluded that the estimated temperature difference did not show any difference useful for analysis and that the HSE (hot spot estimator) was capable of detecting hot spots which would turn out to be ulcer later which the ETD (estimated temperature difference) was not able to. Hernandez-Contreras et al. [21] were able to observe the butterfly pattern associated with nondiabetic subjects. They formulated an index called the TCI (thermal change index) based on the temperature readings of the corresponding angiosomes of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. They concluded that a change of 1\u00b0C was sufficient to identify various thermal classes. No statistical analysis was done for the data. Liu et al. [22] were able to detect abnormal regions in the foot of diabetic patients using the temperature difference between the ipsilateral and contralateral foot with a cutoff of 2.2\u00b0C. Automatic segmentation and registration of the foot was carried out and then the temperature difference between the left and right foot was calculated. But the methodology followed to calculate the temperature difference was not explained. In this work, a new methodology is proposed to analyze accurately the temperature distribution in healthy and diabetic subjects. Renero-C [23] has observed abrupt changes in temperature using thermography to detect possible diabetic foot ulcer formations. Gatt et al. [24] demonstrate that the probability of complications of PAD, neuropathy, and/or neuroischaemia being present increases as the temperature of these regions rises. A narrative review on the various techniques used for diabetic foot complications based on asymmetry analysis, stress test and temperature distribution analysis is given by Hernandez-Contreras et al.

We have explored the use of pretrained deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model called the Mobilenet model [32] to classify the foot images as healthy, diabetic without complications and diabetic with complications. Training a deep learning model from scratch will take days. But a pretrained model can be retrained for our own problem in few hours. It took just few seconds for our problem on a 1060 GPU. The evaluation/classification time taken on the machine for a single image is 0.05 s on an average. We have used the Tensorflow library and the mobilenet architecture for the same. This is a preliminary study to evaluate and understand the applicability of CNN model to thermal infrared images and it has shown promising results.

Hence image acquisition plays a very important role in medical image analysis. This is clearly evident in the research work presented by Sudha et al.

In this paper, authors have analyzed three different setups for acquiring thermal images of the foot and have discussed the influence of these on the accuracy of segmentation. The results show that acquisition protocol influences the result of image processing and hence has a pivotal role to play when it comes to efficient use of infrared thermography in medical image analysis.

High FPs is a result of white pixels which should not be part of the segmented result as in the case of image 3 in the table. This is because the toes are cold and the temperature of the background matches with the other part of the foot and hence it becomes part of the segmented image making the count of white/foreground pixels to increase. Also, FNs in image 8 is high because of cold foot with temperatures merging with the background. Thus, the count of black/background pixels increase which contribute to higher FNs.

This is vice versa in the case of patients with diabetic foot complications where the temperature was higher in the region of complication. \u2022 The temperature difference of 2.2\u00b0C was observed in the presence of foot complication. \u2022 Correlation coefficients between the left and right foot is >0.8 in the case of healthy subjects and it is less in the range of 0.4 to 0.7 in most of the diabetic subjects. Since this range is mutually exclusive between the diabetic and healthy subjects, correlation coefficient is a very good indicator of abnormal thermal pattern. When the patient has good diabetic control, then the correlation is equivalent to that of healthy subject as can be seen in the first two diabetic subjects in Table 3 . \u2022 The right foot had the maximum temperature in the regions 1, 2, and 3 compared to the left foot in all the subjects both healthy and diabetic. This explains why right foot is the most common site for diabetic foot problems. Plantar foot temperature varies in diabetic foot due to thermoregulation problems related to neuropathy and/or ischemia, and also in case of inflammation. There is a wider variation in diabetic patients compared to healthy subjects. Region 3 shows the maximum temperature in two nondiabetic subjects as expected in the arch region where a butterfly pattern is a characteristic of healthy foot as shown in Fig. 13 .",

Registration is approximate in the sense that when the big toe is amputated, the bounding box heights differ and hence the regions are not properly segmented. The hot and cold regions extracted from the images suggest the location of an underlying inflammation or the extent of inflammation if present already in the case of ulcer or the presence of neuropathy. The isolation of these regions will help the doctor in identifying the underlying angiosome for assisting in therapy or surgery. The dataset used is small and it has to be built with more images so that the analysis is more accurate. The next step is to build such a dataset. Segmentation of the foot from the background posed problems in the case of diabetic patients when the toes were cold. Hence we are looking forward to build a deep learning network to do the segmentation.",

This clearly shows that the model is able to distinguish between different categories with greater confidence. This prediction is correct for the given image. Similarly by testing all the images, we got an average accuracy of 91% for each of the classes.

With the special characteristics and advantages of thermal imaging, computer aided diagnosis systems are becoming more and more accurate and effective. The advancements in image processing, feature extraction and selection and soft computing techniques like deep learning in combination with improvements in parallel computing architectures have paved way for more interest and importance to research in this imaging modality. The soft computing techniques used mostly are artificial neural networks, SVM and genetic algorithm with texture based features for most of the classification task. But the most effective ones are the mean temperature difference and correlation. With more computing power and capability of the recent systems and the reappraisal of thermography in medicine, we shall see more advances in deep learning in the years to come. Thermography is being recognized as an adjunct tool for detecting abnormality in the temperature profile of patients to uncover an underlying disease or inflammation. The advantage of being noncontact and noninvasive makes it a safe diagnostic imaging technique. This chapter emphasizes the use of existing soft computing techniques coupled with the specific characteristics of infrared thermography making it more efficient and safe. The authors' current work on automated foot thermal image analysis for diabetic foot assessment is also discussed and future research directions are also given.",
