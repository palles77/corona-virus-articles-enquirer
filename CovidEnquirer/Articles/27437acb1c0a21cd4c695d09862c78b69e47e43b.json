In the present study, we synthesized eighty-one kinds of peptides derived from the spike (S)2 domain of type I FIPV KU-2 strain, the S2 domain of type II FIPV 79-1146 strain, and the nucleocapcid (N) protein of FIPV KU-2 strain. To detect the T helper (Th)1 epitope, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from FIPV-infected cats were cultured with each peptide, and Th1-type immune responses were measured using feline interferon (fIFN)-\u2425 production as an index. To detect the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope, we investigated the reactivity of plasma collected from FIPV-infected cats against each peptide by ELISA. Four and 2 peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in the heptad repeat (HR)1 and inter-helical (IH) regions of the S2 domain of type I FIPV, respectively, and these were located on the N-terminal side of the regions. In the S2 domain of type II FIPV, 2, 3, and 2 peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in the HR1, IH, and HR2 regions, respectively, and these were mainly located on the C-terminal side of the regions. In the S2 domain of type I FIPV, 3 and 7 peptides containing linear immunodominant antibodybinding epitopes were identified in the IH and HR2 regions, respectively. In the S2 domain of type II FIPV, 4 peptides containing linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were identified in the HR2 region. The Th1 epitopes in the S2 domain of type I and II FIPV were located in different regions, but the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were mostly located in the HR2 region. Eight peptides containing Th1 epitopes were identified in N protein, and 3 peptides derived from residues 81 to 100 and 137 to 164 showed strong inductivity of fIFN-\u2425 production in PBMCs isolated from type I FIPV-and type II FIPV-infected non-FIP cats. In N protein, 4 peptides containing linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes were identified, and 2 peptides derived from residues 345 to 372 showed strong reactivity with plasma of type I FIPV-and type II FIPV-infected cats. The Th1 and linear immunodominant antibodybinding epitopes were located at different positions in both the S2 domain and N protein. Our results may provide important information for the development of peptide-based vaccine against FIPV infection.",

            "text": "To prevent FIP, various vaccines such as virulence-attenuated live or inactivated FIPV vaccines, have been investigated, but none have shown sufficient efficacy, and these vaccines rather enhanced the development of FIP [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Intraperitoneal inoculation with FIPV induced more severe clinical signs in anti-FCoV antibodypositive kittens and kittens that received passive immunization with serum or purified IgG from antibody-positive cats compared to antibody-negative kittens [11, 12] . These results of experimental studies suggest that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection can be a serious obstacle to the prevention of FIP by vaccination. Potent cellular immunity was induced in FIPV-infected non-FIP cats [13] [14] [15] [16] . Cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in the prevention of FIP onset [10] . Thus, induction of the cellular immune response is essential for the vaccines against FIPV infection. FIPV consists of three major proteins, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) protein classified as a class I virus fusion protein [17, 18] . The S protein exists as radially protruding trimers on the viral envelope, and can be structurally or functionally divided into two domains, namely the S1 and S2 domains, representing the N-terminal globular head and C-terminal membrane-bound stalk, respectively. The C-terminal S2 domain sequentially contains the pre-coil (PC) region, putative fusion peptide (FP), 4,3 hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR)1, inter-helical (IH) domain, HR2, and the cluster aromatic amino acid domain from the N-terminal, and is responsible for driving viral and target cell membrane fusion [18, 19] . The N-terminal S1 domain contains the receptor-binding epitope, neutralizing antibody-binding epitope, and ADE epitope [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . The S2 domain and N protein homologies between the type I FIPV KU-2 strain and type II FIPV 79-1146 strains are 60.7% and 91.0%, respectively [2, 3] .",

Similar obser-vations were also made in SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV-specific memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from SARS-recovered donors rapidly produced IFN-\u2425 following short-term stimulation with inactivated SARS-CoV or protein derived from SARS-CoV [27, 28, [30] [31] [32] [33] 43] . On the other hand, PBMCs derived from those with critical SARS or who died of SARS apparently could not produce IFN-\u2425 against SARS-CoV antigen stimulation. It is suggested that memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, i.e., cellular immune response, participate in viral clearance in recovered SARS patients. Similarly, we found PBMCs obtained from FIPV-infected non-FIP cats specifically and significantly produced fIFN-\u2425 against heat-inactivated FIPV stimulation, but not FIP cats (submitted). These results substantiate a previous finding that cellular immunity plays an important role in defense against FIPV infection [10, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Thus, induction of the cellular immune response is essential for the development of vaccines against FIPV infection. To detect the Th1 epitope, but not include ADE epitope, we synthesized eighty-one kinds of peptides derived from the S2 domain and the N protein of FIPV.",

Thus, we used PBMCs and plasma of type I FIPV-infected cats to detect Th1 and linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes in type I FIPV S2 domain. Similarly, PBMCs and plasma of type II FIPV-infected cats were used to identify Th1 and linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes in type II FIPV S2 domain. As described above, the Th1 epitope location in the S2 domain was different between FIPV KU-2 and FIPV 79-1146. On the other hand, the N protein homology between the type I FIPV KU-2 and type II FIPV 79-1146 strains is 91.0% [3] . NP-7, NP-8, and NP-9 specifically and significantly induced fIFN-\u2425 production in PBMCs isolated from not only type I FIPV KU-2-infected but also type II FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats. Since NP-8 and NP-9 had a 12-amino acid overlap in their sequences, we investigated specific fIFN-\u2425 production inductivities of NP-7 and NP-8 in PBMCs from FIPV 79-1146-infected cats. NP-7 and NP-8 showed potent fIFN-\u2425 production inductivities in PBMCs from type II FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats but not for PBMCs from FIP and SPF cats. We found that the percentage of CD8 + fIFN-\u2425 + cells was markedly increased by NP-7, but not NP-8. Thus, stimulating PBMCs obtained from FIPV 79-1146-infected non-FIP cats with NP-7 increased fIFN-\u2425 production particularly by FIPV-specific memory CD8 + T cells. This suggests that NP-7 includes Tc1 epitope. On the other hand, in PBMCs obtained from FIP cats, the percentage of CD8 + fIFN-\u2425 + cells was not increased by NP-7 stimulation. Similarly, it was reported that CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are markedly induced by SARS-CoV antigen stimulation in SARSrecovered donors, but not in those with critical SARS or who died of SARS [28, 44] .",

Unstimulated cells were incubated as a negative control. PBMCs were harvested, washed in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mM NaN 3 , and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-feline CD4 MAb (1:200; Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., U.S.A.) or FITC-labeled antifeline CD8 MAb (1:400; Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., U.S.A.) for 30 min at 4 \u2022 C in the dark. After washing, cells were fixed and permeabilized using a Fixation/Permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
