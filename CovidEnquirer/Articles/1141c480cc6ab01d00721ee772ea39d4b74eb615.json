            "text": "Despite its natural abundance in lenses of vertebrates the physiological function(s) of the galectin-related inter-fiber protein (GRIFIN) is (are) still unclear. The same holds true for the significance of the unique interspecies (fish/birds vs mammals) variability in the capacity to bind lactose. In solution, ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray scattering (at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL) characterize the protein as compact and stable homodimer without evidence for aggregation. The crystal structure of chicken (C-) GRIFIN at seven pH values from 4.2 to 8.5 is reported, revealing compelling stability. Binding of lactose despite the Arg71Val deviation from the sequence signature of galectins matched the otherwise canonical contact pattern with thermodynamics of an enthalpically driven process. Upon lactose accommodation, the side chain of Arg50 is shifted for hydrogen bonding to the 3-hydroxyl of glucose. No evidence for a further ligand-dependent structural alteration was obtained in solution by measuring hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometrically in peptic fingerprints. The introduction of the Asn48Lys mutation, characteristic for mammalian GRIFINs that have lost lectin activity, lets labeled C-GRIFIN maintain capacity to stain tissue sections. Binding is no longer inhibitable by lactose, as seen for the wild-type protein. These results establish the basis for detailed structure-activity considerations and are a step to complete the structural description of all seven members of the galectin network in chicken.",

In overview, more than 12 folds have been identified that convey ability to bind glycans [1e4] . Sequence divergence after duplication events, starting from an ancestral gene, then led to forming families of homologous proteins. The case study on galectins (b-galactoside-binding proteins with b-sandwich fold and a sequence signature responsible for ligand contact [5] ) is describing such a network with overlapping and distinct expression profiles [6e8]. This emerging evidence poses the challenge of a complete characterization of the galectins of an organism. It would be a step forward towards delineating rules of network design and providing insights into the functional meaning of sequence variations. In this respect, the galectin fold presents remarkable adaptability for accommodating ligands of different biochemical nature.",

Looking at the assumedly crucial sequence signature for contact to a b-galactoside, a less dramatic deviation than just described may not necessarily impair glycan binding. For example, the change of a seemingly essential Asn (in position 46 in human galectin-1 (Gal-1)) to Ala at the equivalent position 64 in a fungal (Agrocybe cylindracea) galectin is not detrimental. It is neutralized by a five residue insertion at positions 42e46 (with the inserted Asn46 taking the place of the Asn lost at position 64) [13, 14] . The structural way how to maintain affinity for lactosides in the conger eel (Conger myriaster) galectin from peritoneal cells (Con-P), although even seven from eight conserved amino acids are replaced as reported in [15] , has not yet been characterized. Alternatively, sequence deviation(s) can alter carbohydrate specificity. The Trp81Arg change implemented binding to bi-N-acetylated disaccharides (chitobiose, Lac-diNAc) in the third galectin protein (CGL3) from the inky cap mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea [16] . A unique situation, i.e. a species-dependent loss of lectin activity, is encountered for the galectin-related inter-fiber protein, termed GRIFIN.",

Its gene with an elaborate promoter region to facilitate lens-specific expression is a common constituent of vertebrate genomes [19] . Given this sitespecific occurrence and conserved presence among vertebrates, it is exceptional and thus intriguing to see sequence deviations at canonical positions between mammalian and bird/fish GRIFINs. Especially, the equivalent of the already noted Asn46 (in human Gal-1) is turned to Lys in mammalian GRIFINs [17] . As consequence, a bead (lactosylated Sepharose beads) assay revealed no lectin activity for rat GRIFIN [17] . In contrast, GRIFINs from zebrafish [20] and chicken [19] were bona fide lectins. Two reasons prompted us to initiate structural analysis of GRIFINs by studying chicken (C)-GRIFIN: the mentioned plasticity within the galectin fold and our long-term interest to achieve complete crystallographic documentation of galectin structures in an organism. Towards this end, chicken with its (only) seven family members is a favorable model. Since C-GRIFIN shares a deviation from the canonical sequence for lactose binding with mammalian GRIFINs, i.e. the Arg71Val exchange, defining the resulting contact pattern to the ligand will enable a comparison to common features. We here combine crystallographical analysis, reaching atomic resolution, with studies of C-GRIFIN in solution. They were started by determining its quaternary structure, a key feature of proto-type galectin functionality [21] .",

Considering the high local concentration in the lens, we examined the protein status after further increasing the concentration. In sedimentationvelocity experiments at concentrations up to 1.0 mg/mL, C-GRIFIN migrated as single sharp peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 S. In comparison, homodimeric human Gal-1 and CG-1A gave very similar values under these conditions, whereas CG-2 has an S-value of 2.03 \u00b1 0.1 [36] . Frictional ratios among homodimeric proto-type CGs can thus differ when measured by ultracentrifugation. It is about 1.3 for C-GRIFIN and CG-1A but 1.63 for CG-2 [36] . Of note for CG-2, heterogeneity in size distribution had been observed for this protein at 4 mg/mL, with the acquisition of the quaternary structure as trimer of dimers [37] . We proceeded to determine the quaternary structure of C-GRIFIN at concentrations up to 9.0 mg/mL. When reaching the concentration of 9.0 mg/mL in SAXS experiments, the particle distribution function of C-GRIFIN is still in agreement with exclusive presence of a dimer. The ab initio model of the dimer calculated with these data is shown in Fig. 1 . Its elongated disc shape fits well with the frictional ratio of the dimer as calculated using data obtained by ultracentrifugation. Overall, no evidence for aggregation up to this concentration was obtained. These results thus define the quaternary structure in solution as homodimer with no indication for higher-order aggregates at concentrations up to 9 mg/mL under the given conditions. Structural analysis was next taken to the level of crystallography.",

A wide range of combinations of buffers and additives was tested and structural analysis became possible with crystals obtained at seven conditions. In addition to presence of different types of additives, they covered the pH range from 4.2 to 8.5. As summarized in Table 1 , the resolution reached the level of 0.96 \u00c5 for crystals grown at pH 7.5. Space groups differed within this group, P21 seen in three cases, either P4 2 2 2 or P22 1 2 1 in two cases. The asymmetric unit cell content was variable in the seven crystals, being either one, two or four (Table 1) The C-GRIFIN monomer adopts the typical b-sandwich fold with two anti-parallel b-sheets of six (S1-S6) and five (F1-F5) b-strands (Fig. 2) . The short 3 10 helix in the long loop connecting the S2/F5 strands is also a typical feature. Among the proto-type CGs [37e39], the loop between the S3/S4 strands reaches the largest length, as highlighted by rectangles in Fig. 3 . Loop-length variation also holds true for the S4-S5 section. It is four amino acids shorter than in CG-1A/B, while superimposing with that of CG-2 (Fig. 3) . As consequence, a flat surface is created in this region (Fig. 3) . Length, conformation and structure of this loop has been described as a discriminatory factor between human Gal-1 and -3 when interacting with the TF antigen [40] , the core 1 disaccharide of mucintype O-glycosylation (CD176) [41] . Overall, alignment is at a high level, as reflected by rmsd values at 2.9 \u00c5 (to CG-1A, CG-2) and 2.1 \u00c5 (CG-1B). For comparison, respective values are 2.4 \u00c5 for CG-1A/CG-2 and 1.5 \u00c5 for the paralogue pair CG-1A/B.",

The example of CG-2, which is arranged as a non-crystallographic trimer of dimers (added to Fig. S1 ) and occurs in part as hexamer in solution at 4 mg/mL in sedimentation-velocity analysis, underlines capacity of homodimer association of a galectin [13] . Crystal packing of other galectins to a dimer of dimers [42, 43] , also seen for human Gal-1 in solution in an aprotic solvent [44] , that can even be stable in solution [16,45e47] as well as the aggregation of a monomer (murine Gal-9N) to a dimer [48] and Na \u00fe -mediated association of the N-terminal lectin domain of murine Gal-4 to a tetramer around the crystallographic four-fold axis [49] indicate potential of galectin domains for building higher-order aggregates under special conditions. In this study, the availability of crystals of the same protein obtained at different conditions documents the very low degree of influence of the pH value on the galectin fold, with some variability in unit cell Looking closely at the interface region between the two subunits of C-GRIFIN's homodimer, it is established by the F1/S1 strands from the N-and C-termini of each subunit in the homodimer (residues 4e14/127-136) (Fig. 4B) . Around the S1 edge, the salt bridge between Arg5/Glu12 and hydrogen bonds between Glu7/ Leu9 stabilize the assembly. In the case of the anti-parallel F1 strands, hydrogen bonding between Ser131/Thr135 and also Ser130, Ile134 and Lys136 serve this purpose. Typically for CG homodimers, hydrophobic contacts via Phe6, Ile129, Val132 and Ile134 come into play, too (Fig. 4B) . Together, these contacts enable C-GRIFIN to act as cross-linker, reported previously based on haemagglutination assays [19] , or as a kind of molecular glue (please see below). The susceptibility to abolish the cell bridging by presence of lactose at 1.0e1.5 mM, together with C-GRIFIN's binding to lactose-bearing beads used in affinity chromatography, was indicative of lectin activity. Here, we first confirm this conclusion by ITC analysis and then characterize the contact site and its pattern of contact formation with lactose crystallographically.",

Homodimeric CG-1A and CG-2 had similar thermodynamics of binding, whereas ligand association to CG-1B produced a relatively small enthalpy gain [13] . Per dimer, the number of binding sites of 1.76 \u00b1 0.42 was reached at pH 7.2. It increased to 1.89 \u00b1 0.45 by exchanging the methyl by a 2 0 -naphthyl group, together with the considerable enhancement of affinity from 140 mM to 8.6 mM. Adjusting the pH to 8.5 (in TRIS buffer) lowered ligand loading to well below 1 and also the affinity. At the acidic side, no heat production was observed at pH 5.2 (in sodium acetate). This pH profile with rather sharp decreases in binding activity to both sides corresponded well with assays on human Gal-1 using lactose-bearing beads or surface-immobilized asialofetuin [50, 51] . Fittingly, binding sites for lactose in the homodimer were occupied by the ligand in the crystals obtained at pH values of 6.2, 6.5, 8.0 and 8.5, and they remained free when the pH was set to 4.2/4.6. Interestingly, a special circumstance precluded complete loading of both sites of the homodimer at pH 7.5 in the crystal.",

This situation makes a comparison of lactose-free with lactose-loaded subunits possible at atomic resolution. The resulting rmsd value of this superimposition is 0.263 \u00c5, arguing in favor of a common shape irrespective ligand loading. The contact site in crystals at each pH value is composed of amino acids from b-strands S4-S6 (Fig. 4A) . Interestingly, the electron density map of the ligand shows a preference for presence of a-lactose instead of the natural b-anomer at the reducing end, as shown in Fig. S2 , likely by crystallographic contacts. Despite sequence variations among the homodimeric CGs, the canonical contact profile between the protein and lactose is maintained, except for the Arg71Val substitution (Fig. 5) . As illustrated in this figure, the axial 4 0 -hydroxyl group of the galactose moiety is involved in hydrogen (H-)bonding with the conserved His46, Asn48 and Arg50 moieties, sequence conservation of Asn59/Glu69 enabling H-bonding with the 6 0 -hydroxyl group. In addition, the 3 0 -hydroxyl is in watermediated contact with Glu32, and C-H/p interactions with Trp66 complete the binding pattern for the galactose moiety. Since Trp oxidation to the oxindole impairs ligand binding, as first shown for electrolectin [52] , the substantial reactivity of this residue (up to 18.6% after 24 h when exposed to 0.05% hydrogen peroxide [19] ) is noteworthy. Deamidation within peptide 58e70 (after seven days at 25 C/40 C reaching 9.2%/13.5% [19] ) may also have an impact on the protein's lectin activity, if not protected by bound ligand.",

            "text": "In addition to galactose, the 3 0 -hydroxyl group of the glucose part of lactose contributes to ligand binding, as shown for CG-1A and CG-2 by measuring inhibitory capacity of methyl b-lactosides on lectin binding to asialofibrin [53] . b-Methyl derivatives of lactose with 3-deoxy and 3-deoxy-3-methyl glucose have low or no inhibitory potency on CG-1A (and human Gal-1). In C-GRIFIN, this 3-hydroxyl connects by H-bonding with Arg50 and Glu69 (Fig. 5) . Val71, taking the place of the Arg residue conserved in homodimeric CGs and zebrafish GRIFIN, is not able to engage in H-bonding. When for example compared to CG-2 [13] , the Arg71Val substitution causes a loss in H bonding to this hydroxyl for C-GRIFIN. This exchange of an amino acid, which is shared by mammalian GRIFINs, yet does not appear to be detrimental for lactose binding. Considering the pH dependence, contribution to affinity by Glu69 could be reduced by an increasing degree of its protonation. Its pK a was calculated to be 4.6 so that a loss of enthalpy generation may ensue at this site at low pH. Going above neutral pH, His46 (at pK a 6.75) may be a factor in the observed affinity decrease at pH 8.5, whose origin appears to be more complex than a single-site alteration. When extending testing to the 3 0 -O-sulfated derivative of 2naphthyl b-lactoside in ITC, the K D -value decreased from 8.6 to 0.13 mM. This marked enhancement of affinity by presence of the sulfate group is in contrast to 3 0 -sialylation, as observed in cell binding [19] . When comparing the binding mode of the negatively charged lactose derivative to CG-8N, reported previously [31] , with the situation in C-GRIFIN, a lack of interaction with Arg57 and also Glu45 may have an influence on this grading of affinity to the lactoside and its 3 0 -modified derivatives. Binding-site modeling with the 3 0 -O-sulfated lactose as ligand provides a set of putative contacts to the sulfate group that can adopt two orientations (Fig. S3) . Interestingly, these sets include contacts to Asn48 and Arg50 as well as Trp66, albeit not with the same conformer, as is the case for the N-domains of Gal-4 and -8 [54, 55] : Gal-4C, in contrast, appears to employ a transient contact to Trp256 for the slight affinity increase caused by the presence of the 3 0 -sulfate group [56] . When comparing in detail positions of amino acid of the ligandfree and -loaded subunits of the C-GRIFIN homodimer, one liganddependent event of reorganization was revealed (Fig. 6A) . The side chain of Arg50 moves toward the glucose ring into the direction of Trp66 from the position of pointing to Asn48, in this place also in crystallographic interactions with Ser54 and Glu78 of a symmetryrelated protein. Interestingly, the accommodation of ligand into the N-terminal lectin domain of human Gal-9 triggers such a movement of the side chain of Arg87 to let its NH1 become hydrogen bonded with O2 of the glucose moiety [57] . The movement in C-GRIFIN was also seen in crystals obtained at pH 6.2 (Fig. 6B) . When C-GRIFIN in solution bound to lactose on beads and was tryptically fragmented, peptides covering the amino acid stretches of 26e52 and 58e70 had sufficient interactions to maintain their binding during repeated washes and could be eluted [19] . This result is in line with the contact pattern seen in crystals. Taking analysis of C-GRIFIN and lactose binding again to the level of a solution in this report, measuring extent and profile of HDX in the absence and presence of ligand can identify the contact site. Beyond furnishing a sensitive means to do so, measuring the impact of ligand presence on amide deuteration can also detect alterations in this parameter at other sites. This has recently been accomplished for CG-8N when introducing application of this method to galectins [31] . Measured for homodimeric human Gal-1 and CG-1B/2 by small angle neutron scattering and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, respectively [44, 58, 59] , ligand binding can lead to shape changes into both directions, depending on the type of protein. We thus performed HDX experiments with C-GRIFIN.",

The number of detected peptides was 94. The size of the panel ensured complete sequence coverage at a redundancy of 7.25. This value denotes the average frequency of a distinct amino acid position covered by the panel of identified peptides. Presence of lactose reduced deuterium uptake into amides, predominantly in the sequence stretch covering canonical amino acids, with strong impact especially on the peptide 55e61 (Fig. 8) . Changes seen at position 1e17 and 21e38 should be viewed with caution, because no confirmation by overlapping peptides was possible. The quantitative data on the level of peptides given in Fig. 8 can now be introduced by color coding to the crystal structure.

In view of the general importance of Trp66's indole ring for C-H/p interactions, as shown in Fig. 5 , a Trp66Leu mutant was designed, with the expectation of a substantial loss of signal. Next, the structure of mammalian GRIFIN at position 48 was mimicked by the Asn48Lys mutation. Absence of Asn at the equivalent site leads to knocking down lactose-dependent binding for human Gal-1 noted above. This alteration was combined with an Arg50Val exchange, aimed at further harming hydrogen bonding to the 4 0 -hydroxyl group of the galactose moiety. Of note, this pair of two sequence deviations is encountered in chicken galectinrelated protein that has no affinity for lactose (C-GRP [63] ). To complete our series, a triple mutant was engineered. All four variant proteins failed to bind to lactose-bearing beads, precluding their purification by standard affinity chromatography, thus requiring the route over fusion-protein design.",

Incubation of sections with the wild-type protein led to strong staining that was completely inhibited by the cognate sugar (Fig. 9A) . The presence of Trp66Leu mutation decreased signal intensity and capacity of lactose for inhibition (Fig. 9B ). In contrast, the substitution at position 48 even increased signal intensity that was not affected by lactose (Fig. 9C) . By adding the Arg50Val to the Asn48Lys substitution, signal intensity fell back to the level of the Trp66Leu variant (Fig. 9D) .

Of course, other alterations present in mammalian GRIFIN, too, could make their presence felt, because reconstitution at three sites of rat GRIFIN (i.e. Val46Phe, Lys47Asn, Val70Arg) did not repair the defect in lectin activity [17] . Furthermore, the examples of longrange effects of the R111H/C2S mutations in human Gal-1, causing a shift in the positions of His52/Trp68 [13] , and of the SNP-based Phe19Tyr change in a natural variant of human Gal-8 [64] attest remarkable plasticity and sensitivity for subtle changes.

Summary of differences in deuterium uptake over a deuteration time course of 0.5 min, 1 min, 10 min, 60 min and 240 min between peptides of ligand-free and lactose-loaded C-GRIFIN is presented in quantitative form. The peptide index given on the x-axis was calculated on the basis of midpoint values that reflect the position of the peptide within the amino acid sequence of the protein; the blue dotted lines represent the two-sided confidence limit (a 0.02) calculated as described [32] . Fig. 9 . Histochemical staining profiles of biotinylated wild-type C-GRIFIN and three mutants in paraffin-embedded sections of fixed adult chicken kidney. Wild-type C-GRIFIN strongly stained the thick loops (tl), distal tubules (dt) and the apical part of the proximal tubules (pt) (A). Binding was also detected in the collecting ducts (cd) and in the peripheral collecting tubules (ct). Presence of 200 mM lactose led to complete abolishment of binding of C-GRIFIN (inset to A). The introduction of the Trp66Leu mutation led to marked decrease of staining, with only weak signals in the thick loops (tl), distal tubules (dt) and the collecting tubules (ct) (B). Very weak but significant staining was seen in the proximal tubules (pt). Incubation with 200 mM lactose either slightly reduced signal intensity (thick loops (tl), distal tubules (dt), collecting tubules (ct)) or led to complete inhibition of binding (proximal tubules (pt)) (inset to B). In contrast, the Asn48Lys mutant led to very strong staining (C). No inhibitory effect was seen in the presence of lactose (inset to C). Combining this mutation with an Arg50Val substitution (to obtain the Asn48Lys/Arg50Val double mutant) markedly decreased signal intensity in all areas of the section (D), with no effect by presence of 200 mM lactose (inset to D). The concentration of biotinylated proteins was 12 mg/mL. The corresponding category of signal intensity is given in the bottom left part of each microphotograph, according to the following grading system: -, no staining; (\u00fe), very weak but significant staining; \u00fe, weak staining; \u00fe\u00fe, medium-level staining; \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe, strong staining; \u00fe\u00fe\u00fe\u00fe, very strong staining.

Localization of contact site(s) for ligands and monitoring for an impact of the association on solvent accessibility of protein regions are the strengths of this technique [31, 76] . Implementing the Asn48Lys change, a hallmark of mammalian GRIFINs, made binding of this mutant protein to tissue sections rather insensitive to lactose presence, intimating this position to be a key site for interactions. This result and the presented structural informations build a solid foundation to proceed in the quest to understand GRIFIN's role as lens protein not present, for example, in the retina [17, 19, 77] . Moreover, they are a step toward completing the structural analysis of the galectin network in a model organism, i.e. in chicken with its seven members.",
