            "text": "Rule 1. No more causes of natural things should be admitted than are both true and sufficient to explain their phenomena. (Newton, 1999, p. 794) Rule 2. Therefore, the causes assigned to natural effects of the same kind must be, so far as possible, the same. (Newton, 1999, p. 795) Rule 1 instructs us to explicate 3 nature in the simplest way possible while still maintaining truth. Although Newton mentions the philosophic adage that 'nature 2 Koyr\u00e9 identifies six revisions of rule 2 between the second and third editions of the Principia and five revisions of rule 4 in Newton's manuscripts before including it in the third edition (Koyr\u00e9, 1965, pp. 265-271) . 3 Although Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman translate Newton as using 'explain' in rule 1, this translation is debatable. Newton's rule 1 in its original Latin is the following: 'Regula I. Causas rerum naturalium non plures admitti debere, quam quae et vera sunt et earum Phenomenis explicandis sufficiunt' (Koyr\u00e9, 1965, p. 265) . Notice that Newton uses 'explicandis', a participle of 'explicare', which in the period often has the sense of the English 'explicate'. Newton does not use 'explanare', which in the period was often equivalent to the English 'explain'. This point is worth mentioniong since 'explicate' means 'to give a detailed analysis of', while 'explain' means 'to give the reason for or cause of'. From the wording of rule 1, Newton appears to be satisfied with detailed analyses of phenomena, regardless of whether those phenomena have been assigned a cause. If this interpretation is accurate, then it would be consistent with what Newton says in the General Scholium of the Principia when he mentions that he has not deduced a mechanism for gravity even though he has established gravity as the force that maintains our planetary system (Newton, 1999, p. 943). does nothing in vain', given Newton's distaste for 'hypotheses', 4 Newton's real intent for rule 1 is to limit claims about differences in causes to ones that the empirical data force (Smith, 2002b, p. 160) . In other words, rule 1 restricts theory making to information that has been gathered through experiments or other empirical observations even if only indirectly. 5 Given the 'therefore' and the placement of rule 2 almost immediately after rule 1, rule 2 is more likely the consequent of rule 1 than a separate rule all by itself (Harper, 2002, p. 183) . So, given rule 1, rule 2 assigns the same cause to the same phenomena. Newton first uses rules 1 and 2 in proposition 4 (prop. 4) for the moon test, which equates terrestrial gravity with lunar centripetal acceleration. 6 (See Appendix A for a thorough discussion of the moon test.) Newton then uses rules 1 and 2 in prop. 5 to attribute the five primary planets' centripetal acceleration to gravity. 7 Newton uses the rules a final time in the scholium to prop. 5 to equate all celestial centripetal acceleration with gravity.",

            "text": "The importance of rules 1 and 2 in their first application is that without them Newton cannot infer that the moon's acceleration toward the earth and terrestrial bodies' acceleration toward the earth are in fact from identical causes. Although Newton has deduced that the value for lunar centripetal acceleration is very nearly equal to the value for terrestrial gravity-since Newton's value in prop. 4 falls within the error bounds of Christiaan Huygens's precise measurement of terrestrial gravity-the most that Newton has proven is that these accelerations have corresponding magnitudes and direction. Newton needs an inductive rule to instruct him that it is permissible to conclude from this similarity that these two phenomena are due to the same cause. Although rules 1 and 2 are not necessary to make this induction, they suffice. 4 Newton clearly had distaste for hypotheses. This distaste grew between subsequent editions of the Principia, as evidenced by his reluctance to even use the word, except pejoratively, in the third edition. For example, Newton labels the first two rules of reasoning as 'hypotheses' in the first edition, but by the third edition Newton uses 'hypotheses' negatively in a statement following rule 4 as well as in the General Scholium when he says 'I do not feign hypotheses' and 'hypotheses have no place in experimental philosophy' (Newton, 1999, p. 943 ). Koyr\u00e9 suggests that Newton is not being contradictory here; he is merely showing how he has narrowed his definition of 'hypotheses'. Prior to this narrowing, Newton considered hypotheses tantamount to principles. Later on, however, Newton restricts 'hypotheses' to 'undemonstratable assertions', 'assumptions without experimental proof', and 'propositions not deduced from phenomena' (Koyr\u00e9, 1965, pp. 262-265) . 5 I say 'even if only indirectly' here because, as George Smith points out, if by 'phenomena' Newton is referring to phenomena similar to his 'Phenomena' in Book 3, Newton is referring to a generalization of a collection of empirical observations made over a period of time, not individual empirical observations (Smith, 2002b, p. 160) . 6 Proposition 4. 'The moon gravitates toward the earth and by the force of gravity is always drawn back from rectilinear motion and kept in its orbit' (Newton, 1999, p. 803 The second application of rules 1 and 2 serves a similar, but slightly different purpose. In prop. 5, although Newton has established in prop. 2 that the primary planets have centripetal accelerations with the same properties as the moon-namely, that they are proportional to the inverse-square of the distance from their centres of orbit in which equal areas are swept out in equal times and that they are directed toward their centres of orbit-without an inductive rule to permit an identity relation between the moon's kind of acceleration and the kind keeping the primary planets in orbit, Newton has only shown that these accelerations have the same properties. 8 Invoking rules 1 and 2 classifies each of these accelerations as the same kind. Rules 1 and 2 are used in the same way to designate all celestial centripetal acceleration as the gravitational kind. So, in all three applications the rules invoke identical causes; however, in the first application the cause is a particular and in the last two the cause is a kind. 9 The following is Newton's third rule of reasoning:",

            "text": "Rule 3. Those qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and remitted [that is, qualities that cannot be increased and diminished] and that belong to all bodies on which experiments can be made should be taken as qualities of all bodies universally. (Newton, 1999, p. 795) William Harper refers to rule 3 as Newton's 'argument from phenomena' (Harper, 2002, p. 175) , and this rule does just that. If a property satisfies a certain empirical criterion, rule 3 instructs us to consider that property as universal, where the criterion is being a constant property of all bodies that are observable through experiment. Newton explicitly invokes rule 3 only once, although he implicitly invokes it two more times. In corollary 2 of prop. 6, Newton uses rule 3-along with the results from his pendulum experiments that show a body's weight to its mass is a constant at the earth's surface-to make the induction that all bodies gravitate toward the 8 Proposition 2. 'The forces by which the primary planets are continually drawn away from rectilinear motions and are maintained in their respective orbits are directed to the sun and are inversely as the squares of their distances from its center' (ibid., p. 802). 9 Notice that even in the first application of rules 1 and 2, Newton shows that lunar centripetal acceleration is of the same kind as terrestrial gravity, since identical kinds follow from identical particulars. My effort to distinguish Newton's two types of applications of rules 1 and 2 is meant to highlight that Newton is ultimately engaged in something different in his second and third applications of rules 1 and 2 as compared to his first application. For example, in the second application Newton is not trying to attribute identical particular gravitational accelerations to each of the five primary planets and the moon, since that would make the centre of the earth count as the centre of planetary centripetal acceleration, which contradicts Newton's position against geocentricism (ibid., pp. 811-819). earth. 10 However, since prop. 6 claims to have shown that 'all bodies gravitate toward each of the planets', Newton must have implicitly invoked rule 3 a second time. 11 Probably, Newton took the generalization for the earth and rule 3 to show that prop. 6 holds. 12 Also, in prop. 7, although Newton shows that all of the particles of any two planets gravitate toward each other, he must have implicitly invoked rule 3 in order to extend the argument to all of the particles in the universe, which as William Harper notes (2002, p. 192) , could have been done since Newton's proof included all of the planets in reach of experiments at that time. 13 One importance of rule 3 is that without it Newton cannot assert that all bodies near planets gravitate toward those planets in the same fashion as observed bodies near planets (for example, satellites and terrestrial bodies). 14 However, establishing the latter is not crucial to Newton's argument for gravity between particles since gravity between planets can be deduced from celestial centripetal acceleration being due to gravity (which I will explain later). Another importance of the rule is that the last step in the argument for universal gravity requires a generalization to all particles in the universe that only rule 3 provides. Also, notice that the first use of rule 3 is for an induction from terrestrial bodies to all bodies near the earth while the second use is for an induction from all bodies near the earth to all bodies near any planet. Thus the second induction is nested, where being 'nested' is having the 10 Corollary 2, Proposition 6. 'All bodies universally that are on or near the earth are heavy [or gravitate] toward the earth, and the weights of all bodies that are equally distant from the center of the earth are as the quantities of matter in them. This is a quality of all bodies on which experiments can be performed and therefore by rule 3 is to be affirmed of all bodies universally. If the aether or any other body whatever either were entirely devoid of gravity or gravitated less in proportion to the quantity of its matter, then, since (according to the opinion of Aristotle, Descartes, and others) it does not differ from other bodies except in the form of its matter, it could by a change of its form be transmuted by degrees into a body of the same condition as those that gravitate the most in proportion to the quantity of their matter; and, on the other hand, the heaviest bodies, through taking on by degrees lose their gravity. And accordingly the weights would depend on the forms of bodies and could be altered with the forms, contrary to what has been proved in corol. 1' (ibid., p. 809). 11 Proposition 6. 'All bodies gravitate toward each of the planets, and at any given distance from the center of any one planet the weight of any body whatever toward that planet is proportional to the quantity of matter which the body contains' (ibid., p. 806). 12 My point about Newton's first implicit use of rule 3 is that he needs rule 3 to infer that all bodies gravitate toward each of the planets, not that he needs rule 3 to infer that all of the planets gravitate toward the earth or that all of the planets gravitate toward each of the planets. Given the universal scope of prop. 6 and the fact that Newton could not have performed experiments on celestial bodies beyond the scope of experiments, Newton indeed needs the inductive power of rule 3 to make prop. 6. 13 Proposition 7. 'Gravity exists in all bodies universally and is proportional to the quantity of matter in each' (ibid., p. 810). 14 Where 'same fashion' means 'in proportion to their weight at some distance by their mass and in proportion to the inverse-square of their distance from the planet's center'.",

In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by induction should be considered either exactly or very nearly true notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena make such propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions. (Newton, 1999, p. 796) Coined 'the rule of conduct [for] empiricism' by Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 (1965, p. 268) , rule 4 does three things for natural philosophy. First, it instructs us that theories deduced from phenomena and generalized by induction always override theories that fail to do so. Second, the phrase 'should be considered exactly or very nearly true' instructs us to model the world as idealizations. 18 Third, the clause after the last comma suggests that natural philosophy is an ongoing program of making ever better idealizations of the world. The latter two points turn natural philosophy into an exact science, not insofar as it calls for idealizations, but insofar as it suggests that phenomenal deviations from those idealizations, or theory dependent second-order phenomena, 19 must be addressed in a new idealization that better approximates the world (Smith, 2002b, pp. 157-160) . Newton invokes rule 4 only once although he could have invoked it several times. In the scholium to prop. 5, Newton uses rule 4 after applying rules 1 and 2. 20 The effect of applying the rule here is to establish it as a principle that centripetal acceleration for celestial bodies is the same kind of acceleration as terrestrial gravity. Newton needs the latter to be a principle in order to establish universal gravity in a way that is not hypothetico-deductive. 21 As we see from prop. 7, Newton's argument for gravity between particles depends as much on his laws of motion as it does on the attraction between planets being due to gravity, since gravity between planets is a premise in the argument:",

For instance, data that supported the Copernican system for the planets also supported the Tychonic system (Gingerich, 1993, pp. 30-31) . 26 In that case, it makes sense to devise a rule that restricts theory construction to only those propositions that are supported by empirical evidence (since the task is difficult enough even before 'hypotheses' are proposed). Having a rule that does this is the first step toward winnowing one overriding explanation for a phenomenon out of a consortium of possible explanations. Therefore, despite Newton's preoccupation with simplicity, rule 1 is justified by its importance to the methodology of Newton's experimental philosophy.",

A garden path happens when science proceeds in the wrong direction. The length of a garden path is the amount of science that will have to be discarded once we discover that science has been going in the wrong direction. 28 For example, Smith argues that Newton's data were not precise enough to establish that planetary centripetal forces are directed toward the focus of an ellipse as opposed to the centre, which would have suggested a force that varies as the distance instead of the inverse-square of the distance, according to prop. 10 of Book 1 (Smith, 2002a, p. 196) . 29 The term is George Smith's.

The worse the spherical representation, the more g varies. The more g varies, the less accurate our prediction of g 0 . Also, the worse the spherical representation or the less circular the lunar orbit or the less reliable 60r is as the lunar orbit's radius, the worse 'C=2p' approximates r.

Peculiarly enough, nowhere in the Principia does Newton discuss the parameters of an acceptable experiment, which seems odd since Newton is promoting experimental philosophy. 36 In order to capture the strength of this criticism, let me use an analogy. Instead of its actual wording, imagine rule 3 stated, 'on which blibbles can be made'. However, this instruction only raises the question: what is a blibble? In that case, questioning what counts as an experiment is not absurd when questioning the validity of rule 3. Although I agree that a vague rule is invalid, it is not clear that Newton's audience cannot extrapolate the parameters of an acceptable experiment by reading the Principia. Examples are the pendulum experiments Newton presents in the scholium to the laws of motion and prop. 6 of Book 3. However, from reading prop. 6, we see a new type of experiment that Newton is willing to count as acceptable: vicarious investigations. 37 In Newton's satellite test, he uses theory-mediated measurements to investigate whether the sun emits an equal gravitational field on Jupiter and its satellites.",

Since the cross-check assumes celestial orbits are circular, the check does not rule out higher-order power rules that better characterize less circular orbits. In this sense, the reliability of the check depends on the reliability of observational measurements that celestial orbits are at least very nearly circular. If Newton had that sort of data, then his induction to the three halves power rule in phen. 1 was valid. Similar arguments follow for Newton's construction of phen. 2 through phen. 6. So, nesting rule 4 does not have to be invalid, since rule 1 could apply or other valid reasons for the induction on which rule 4 is nested could be proposed (for example, if a proposition passes a cross-check). 43 43 Another example of a cross-check for the three halves power relation involves using Newton's precession theorem. In corol. 1, prop. 45 of Book 1, Newton develops a measure for the motion of orbital apsides that are very nearly circular. He finds the following relation of apsidal precession to the proportionality rule governing an orbit's centripetal accelerative force: p v precession iff F a / r \u00f0360=360\u00fep\u00de 2 \u00c03 .",

Doing so provides the function: p \u00bc \u00f0360 = p \u00f04 2s\u00de\u00de 360. Substituting values for s shows that when s equals 3/2, 7/5, or 10/7, p equals 0, \u00c031 1 / 3 , or \u00c023 1 / 4 , respectively. The result is that if the power relation between period and distance is s, then the orbital aphelions of Jupiter's satellites are precessing at p v per revolution. Since apsidal precession of magnitudes as great as 31 1 / 3 v or 23 1 / 4 v were observable, but were not observed, the three halves power relation was the valid induction to make. Although the precession theorem was derived for orbits that are very nearly circular, William Harper (2002) , p. 181 points out that the theorem is adaptable for elliptical orbits. Since the precession theorem does not depend on the eccentricity of the orbit, this cross-check is arguably stronger than the one presented in (5.1) through (5.9).",

Newton's moon test is provided after prop. 4: Let us assume a mean distance [of the moon from the earth] of 60 semidiameters in the syzygies; and also let us assume that a revolution of the moon with respect to the fixed stars is completed in 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, as has been established by astronomers; and that the circumference of the [lunar orbit] is 123,249,600 Paris feet, according to the measurements made by the French.

The importance of syzygies lies in the fact that only at the syzygies could astronomers in Newton's day extrapolate information about the distance between the earth and the moon. Furthermore, if the lunar orbit is approximately circular, then information about the earth-moon distance at a syzygy can be extended to any earth-moon distance on the lunar orbit, making the syzygial earth-moon distance an estimation of the lunar orbit's semidiameter.",

Also, cosh \u00bc Ba = AB. 45 These terms are important because Newton intends to show that if the moon travels an arc over some time t while orbiting the earth, which is at the centre of its orbit, then if the moon did not have any inertial velocity, it would travel toward the earth in proportion to the versed sine of that arc over the same time t.",
