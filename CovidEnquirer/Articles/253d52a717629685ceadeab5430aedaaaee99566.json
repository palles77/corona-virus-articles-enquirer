Perhaps their most distinctive properties are the flow of information from RNA to DNA early in the infectious process, and the subsequent integration of the viral DNA into the chromosomal DNA of the host cell. Retroviruses are the causative agents of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) It is interesting to note that elements with striking similarities to retroviruses, termed retrotransposons, occur in yeast and many other eukaryotes; elements sharing some characteristics with retroviruses have also recently been observed in prokaryotes (reviewed in Garfinkel, 1991) . Because of the apparent relationship between retroviruses and retrotransposons, we will consider retrotransposons as well as retroviruses in this review.",

As indicated in Fig. 1 , the gag coding sequences are found a t the 5' end of this mRNA. The enzyme-coding region (generally referred to as the pol gene) is immediately 3' of the termination codon a t FIG. 1. Expression of retroviral pol and pro genes from a single gag-pro-pol translational unit by in-frame readthrough, single frameshift, and double frameshift, as illustrated for the respective viruses. The gag, pro, and pol open reading frames are shown together with the following symbols for termination codons: 0 UAG; A, UAA, and V, UGA. The boldface horizontal bars represent the primary translational products, which are processed into smaller functional units as indicated. The protein nomenclature used is that of Leis et al. (1988) ; MA, matrix; CA, capsid; NC, nucleocapsid; PR, protease; RT, reverse transcriptase; and IN, integrase. is, In-frame suppression; and fs, frameshift. Locations of transframe proteins (TF) are also shown. The numbers indicate the approximate molecular weights of the proteins. Arrows indicate the site of translation initiation. in-frame readthrough: the end of the gag gene. Most of the ribosomes engaged in Gag protein synthesis terminate peptide chain elongation in response to this termination codon (as would be expected), resulting in the synthesis of the Gag structural polyprotein. However, a minority of these ribosomes engage in translational suppression: that is, they continue peptide synthesis beyond the termination codon, generating a large Gag-Pol fusion protein. Because the Gag polyprotein precursor normally performs the self-assembly processes responsible for virus assembly, it seems very likely that the Gag moiety of the Gag-Pol fusion protein participates in this self-assembly along with the authentic Gag polyprotein, so that the Gag-Pol fusion protein is incorporated into the virus particle. Thus the use of translational suppression in pol gene expression simultaneously modulates the relative level of Pol protein synthesis and provides for the inclusion of the Pol proteins in the virion. Though all retroviruses utilize translational suppression in Pol protein synthesis, different groups of retroviruses use two completely distinct types of translational suppression. One of these is in-frame or readthrough suppression, and the other is ribosomal frameshifting.",

READTHROUGH SUPPRESSION As noted above, a single inframe UAG termination codon separates the gag and pol genes in the mammalian type C retroviruses (Shinnick et al., 1981; Tamura, 1983; Herr, 1984; Etzerodt et al., 1984; Kato et al., 1987; Weaver et al., 1990) . The synthesis of a large Gag-Pol fusion protein in murine leukemia virus (MuLVbinfected cells, at a molar ratio of approximately 1:20 with that of the Gag polyprotein, was originally observed by Jamjoom et al. (19771, who suggested the existence of a translational control mechanism governing the synthesis of this product. As discussed in a recent review by Jacks (1990) , an obvious alternative was the presence of a distinct gag-pol mRNA from which the termination codon in the viral genome had been removed by splicing.",

One important experimental approach that has been used in analyzing the synthesis of the fusion protein has been in uitro translation (Jackson and Hunt, 1983) . Early experiments (Kerr et al., 1976; Murphy et al., 1978) showed that translation reactions programmed with virion RNA were capable of synthesizing the Gag-Pol precursor as well as the Gag polyprotein. Indeed, the ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol produced in these in uitro systems appeared to be comparable to that observed in the infected cell. Thus gag-pol mRNA is present in the virus particle. Because virion RNA is apparently a single, homogeneous species, the gag-pol mRNA is evidently indistinguishable from the genomic RNA of the virus in its approximate size and composition. However, these observations could not exclude the possibility that virions contained a second RNA species, distinct from the genomic RNA by virtue of the fact that the termination codon a t the end of gag had been removed by splicing.",

In 1985, Yoshinaka et al. reported the isolation and N-terminal amino acid sequence of the PR of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) (Yoshinaka et al., 1985a) . Because the PR gene is at the 5' end of the pol coding region (Levin et al., 1984; Crawford and Goff, 1985; Katoh et al., 19851, it was expected that the protein would begin with an amino acid sequence encoded entirely 3' of the gag termination codon. However, when the actual N-terminal sequence was compared with the MuLV proviral DNA sequence (Shinnick et al., 19811, it was found that the first four residues represented the last four codons of the gag gene. They were followed by a glutamine residue, and then by the amino acids encoded at the 5' end of the pol gene. It thus appears that the PR is formed by cleavage of the Gag-Pol fusion protein at a site four residues before the last gag-encoded amino acid. Similar results were also obtained by sequencing the PR of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Yoshinaka et al., 1985b) . The protein sequences showed clearly that (1) PR is synthesized by translation of a mRNA containing the UAG termination codon present in the viral genome, rather than by a spliced mRNA lacking this codon, and (2) the UAG termination codon is suppressed in uiuo by a glutamine tRNA.",

However, the UAG termination codons found a t the ends of many coding sequences in the cellular genome (Kohli and Grosjean, 1981; Brown et al., 1990) are not suppressed significantly (Capone et al., 1986; Sedivy et al., 1987; Martin et al., 1989) . How can we explain this striking difference between translation of cellular and viral mRNAs? One simple explanation for the efficiency of termination at normal cellular termination sites would be that they are actually multiple, tandem termination codons. However, survey of a number of eukaryotic coding sequences showed that this is not the case (Kohli and Grosjean, 1981; Brown et al., 1990) . Another possibility is that normal termination codons are associated with signals favoring termination, in essence \"protecting\" them from the cellular tRNAs capable of suppression. Finally, the viral mRNA may contain signals promoting the suppression event. As discussed by Valle and Morch (1988) and below, it seems likely that both of these latter hypotheses are correct.",

This fragment, corresponding to the region of MuLV mRNA near the gag-pol junction, was inserted into a construct at the 5' end of the lac2 gene. When this construct was transfected into mammalian cells, a significant level of readthrough of the UAG codon was observed; indeed, the level of suppression (about 10%) was quantitatively comparable to that which actually takes place during translation of the viral genome in uiuo. A control construct, containing an inframe UAG codon but lacking the viral sequences, showed no detectable suppression. In a somewhat analogous experiment, Honigman et al. (1991) changed a CAG codon within the Mo-MuLVgag gene (nt 1623 -1625 Shinnick et al., 1981) to UAG, and observed no suppression of this UAG codon in an in uitro translation system.",

(1989) made point mutations in sequences surrounding the Mo-MuLV gug-pol junction that would destroy the stem and measured the effect on viral infectivity. Changes that would allow base pairing in the stem (Fig. 31 , e.g., C2220 to U and G2252 to A, or C2220 to U alone, led to the production of infectious virions, whereas mutations that would destabilize the secondary structure, e.g., A 2223 to C and G2252 to A, or G2252 to A alone, did not.

( 1989) suggested that a region of secondary structure near the UAG codon must be preserved; however, their study did not test the effect of destabilizing mutations upstream of the UAG codon (e.g., A2223 to C alone) nor did they measure suppression directly. In a related series of experiments carried out in uitro, Honigman et al. (1991) introduced destabilizing mutations into residues in the stem of the putative stem-loop structure ( Fig. 3 ) a t positions 5' (nt 2222-2226, GACCC to AAUAU) and 3' (nt 2246-2250, GGGUC to UCAUG) of the UAG codon. The upstream mutation had no effect on suppression in the in uitro system; in contrast, the downstream mutation prevented readthrough. These results led Honigman et al. (1991) to conclude that a secondary structure involving the UAG codon and nearby nucleotides at the MuLV gug-pol junction is unlikely to be important in suppression and in addition emphasized the role of the downstream sequences. It is interesting that stem-loop structures similar to the one shown in Fig. 3 probabiy do not exist in the viral mRNAs of other mammalian type C retroviruses that undergo readthrough suppression (Panganiban, 1988; ten Dam et al., 1990) . Even more importantly, it has been pointed out (Panganiban, 1988 ) that a stem-loop structure containing the UAG codon is unlikely, because the structure would have to be disrupted before ribosome movement and misreading of the UAG codon could occur.",

These runs of C and G residues are fairly well conserved in other mammalian type C retrovirus genomes (ten Dam et al., 1990) ( Fig. 2 ).

            "text": "The mutational analysis discussed above indicates that at least part of the signal that governs readthrough suppression is contained within the primary sequence of the viral mRNA. An important question to consider is whether this signal is specific for the UAG codon or whether other termination codons can be substituted within the nucleotide context required for suppression. Feng et al. (1989b) used oligonucleotidedirected mutagenesis to change the UAG codon at the Mo-MuLV gagpol junction to UAA or UGA. Both UAA and UGA were suppressed with the same efficiency as UAG in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Feng et al., 1989a,b) . In the case of UAA, however, the system had to be supplemented with additional tRNA; rabbit liver tRNA or tRNA from uninfected or MuLV-infected NIH/3T3 cells were equally effective (Feng et al., 198915) . This observation suggested that the tRNA that suppresses UAA is not abundant in the usual calf liver tRNA-supplemented rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Jackson and Hunt, 1983; Feng et al., 1989a) and that the UAA suppressor tRNA is not unique to mouse cells. In uiuo experiments carried out by transfecting intact viral genomes with UAA or UGA instead of UAG into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (conditions that do not permit selection of revertants to wild type) led to production of infectious virions with approximately the same titer as wild type (Feng et al., 1989b) . Similarly, the viral capsid (CAI protein and the Pol proteins, RT and IN, were present in equivalent amounts in virions derived from mutant and wild-type genomes (Feng et al., 1989b3 . Indeed, the Gag and Gag-Pol precursor proteins were synthesized to the same extent in the cells transfected with UAG-, UAA-, or UGA-containing viral genomes (A. Rein, unpublished observations 1989) . From these results, Feng et al. (1989b) concluded that (1) the signal(s) for UAG suppression are effective with UAA and UGA; (2) UAA is not an absolute termination codon in higher eukaryotes, as had been previously thought (Geller and Rich, 1980; Valle and Morch, 1988) ; and (3) mammalian cells and cell extracts contain tRNAs capable of suppressing UGA and UAA termination codons that appear in a retroviral context. Jones et al. (1989) also reported that mutant Mo-MuLV viral genomes with alternate stop codons can give rise to infectious virus particles.",

            "text": "The discovery that all three termination codons are suppressible in the MuLV system raised the possibility of identifying previously unknown suppressor tRNAs. The approach used was to translate a miniconstruct mRNA that has a short leader sequence containing an AUG codon, followed by two codons from the 3' end of gag, a termination or sense codon, 19 codons from the 5' end ofpol, and the binding domain of protein A. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the product was then determined by the Edman degradation technique (Feng et al., 1990a) . The predicted amino acid sequence of the first 20 amino acids of the fusion product is shown in Fig. 4 ; position 8 represents the residue a t the Gag-Pol junction. Comparison of the Edman degradation patterns obtained using mRNAs with UAG and CAG (a glutamine code word) showed that the relative amounts of radioactive glutamine incorporated a t the readthrough site and a t two positions in Pol (Fig. 4) were the same for both products. This result demonstrated that UAG is translated predominantly, if not exclusively, as glutamine and pointed to the parallel between suppression in uitro and in uiuo, where the UAG termination codon is known to be read as glutamine (Yoshinaka et al., 1985a) . In addition, sequence analysis of the UAA fusion protein showed that UAA, like CAG and UAG, directs the sole incorporation of glutamine at the Gag-Pol junction (Feng et al., 1990a) . This finding represented the first (and to date only) identification of an amino acid inserted in response to UAA in a higher eukaryote. Surprisingly, in the case of UGA, three amino acids, arginine, cysteine, and tryptophan, were inserted a t the GAG-Pol junction (Feng et al., 1990a) . It is of interest that early codon recognition studies (Marshall et al., 1967; Caskey et al., 1968; Hatfield, 1972) indicated that arginine, cysteine, and tryptophan tRNAs can respond to UGA in the ribosomal binding assay of Nirenberg and Leder (1964) . However, misreading of UGA as cysteine and arginine during protein synthesis had not been previously described for higher eukaryotes.",

The molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between these factors are poorly understood. Presumably, there is a competition between suppressor tRNA and a release factor that determines whether suppression can take place.

The sequences of these glutamine tRNAs were the same except for the 5' position of the anticodon and the nucleotides a t positions 4 and 68 in the acceptor stem; both tRNAs occurred in hypo-and hypermodified forms. Both forms of the minor tRNA species were able to weakly suppress the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) UAG codon in an in vitro suppression assay, but neither form of the major species had any suppressor activity (Kuchino et al., 1987) . Interestingly, misreading of a UAG termination codon by the minor glutamine isoacceptor would involve unusual codon-anticodon recognition by mispairing at both the first and third positions of the codon. Because the MuLV and TMV systems are not identical, it is not clear that the minor glutamine tRNA functions as the suppressor in MuLV infection as proposed (Kuchino et al., 1987) . Thus, in contrast t o the situation with MuLV (Feng et al., 1990a1 , the tRNA specificity for i n uitro suppression of the TMV UAG codon is less stringent and several tRNAs exhibit suppressor activity, including glutamine (Kuchino et al., 1987) and leucine (Valle et al., 1987) as well as the hypomodified tyrosine tRNA, which is the TMV suppressor i n uiuo (Bienz and Kubli, 1981; Beier et al., 1984a) .",

(1987) reported that infection with Mo-MuLV increased the amount of the minor glutamine tRNA. Other investigators have obtained different results. Feng et al. (1989a) found that infection with Mo-MuLV did not change the chromatographic profile of glutamine isoacceptors or the level of glutamine acceptor activity. Moreover, it could be shown that suppression of the Mo-MuLV UAG termination codon i n uitro was stimulated to the same extent by tRNA isolated from MuLV-infected or uninfected NIH13T3 cells (Feng et al., 1989a) . Similarly, as noted above, Panganiban (1988) observed that i n uiuo suppression of the UAG codon a t the gag-pol junction occurred with the same efficiency in Mo-MuLV-infected and uninfected mouse cells. Taken together, these findings led Feng et al. (1989a) to conclude that the glutamine suppressor tRNA occurs normally within the tRNA population of uninfected cells and is not altered or induced in response to virus infection. In addition, the observation that all three termination codons can be suppressed with the same efficiency in vitro and i n vivo (Feng et al., 1989b) and the fact that several distinct suppressor tRNAs can function within the MuLV context (Feng et al., 1990a ; see below) are difficult to reconcile with a requirement for viral induction of suppressor tRNA.",

As in the case of UAG, it is not known which isoacceptor functions as the UAA suppressor in the MuLV system. Suppression of both UAA and UAG termination codons by glutamine tRNAs has a precedent in yeast. The yeast glutamine tRNA, which can suppress UAA, normally decodes CAA (Pure et al., 1985) , whereas a different isoacceptor, which normally recognizes CAG, suppresses UAG (Weiss and Friedberg 1986; Lin et al., 1986; A. . Whether UAA and UAG are suppressed by two distinct glutamine tRNAs in mammalian cells as they are in yeast is not known. In this connection, it may be relevant that additional tRNA must be added to mammalian extracts for efficient suppression of UAA, but not of UAG (Feng et al., 1989b (Feng et al., , 1990a .",

            "text": "Because the UGA termination codon at the gag-pol junction was decoded as three amino acids, arginine, cysteine, and tryptophan, a number of different tRNAs must mediate UGA suppression. Tryptophan tRNA involvement in UGA suppression has already been observed in normal mammalian cells and bacteria. Geller and Rich (1980) proposed that mammalian tryptophan tRNA can function as a UGA suppressor based on their finding that partially purified tryptophan tRNA from reticulocyte lysates stimulates in uitro suppression of a UGA termination codon in P-hemoglobin mRNA. In bacteria, wild-type tryptophan tRNA and a mutant tryptophan suppressor tRNA with a G-to-A change at position 24 (Hirsh, 1971 ) decode the UGG tryptophan codon and UGA in vitro (Hirsh and Gold, 1971 ) and in uiuo (Raftery et al., 1984) . Interestingly, Buckingham and Kurland (1977) found that the suppressor tRNA also decodes the UGU cysteine codon with low efficiency in uitro. Because mammalian tryptophan tRNA, like its bacterial counterpart (Hirsh, 19711 , is expected to have a CCA anticodon, interaction with UGA may require C-A mispairing at the third position of the codon. Similarly, insertion of cysteine (UGU and UGC codons) in response to UGA would be expected to involve mispairing at the third position of the codon. Although arginine has six codons and several isoacceptors (Hatfield, 1972) , the most likely candidate for suppressor activity in this case would appear to be a CGA-decoding tRNA, which could suppress UGA by G-U mispairing a t the first position of the codon, in analogy to the interactions of glutamine tRNAs with UAA and UAG in yeast (Pure et al., 1985; Weiss and Friedberg, 1986; Lin et al., 1986; W. A. Weiss et al., 1987) and possibly in MuLV. The possibility that as of yet unidentified specialized suppressor tRNA(s) are involved in readthrough suppression at the MuLV gug-pol junction should also be considered. The subject of suppressor tRNAs in readthrough suppression in higher eukaryotes has also been reviewed by Valle (1989 ), Hatfield et al. (1990a , and Valle and Haenni (1991) .",

A number of plant viruses, including TMV (Pelham, 1978; Goelet et al., 1982) , carnation mottle virus (Guilley et al., 1985) , and beet necrotic yellow vein virus (Bouzoubaa et al, 19861 , and use readthrough of a UAG codon. An elegant analysis by Skuzeski et al. (1991) has shown that in the case of TMV, the signal responsible for readthrough suppression is confined to the two codons immediately 3' of the termination codon. It is intriguing to note that many plant viruses exhibiting readthrough suppression have a nearly identical sequence in this position, whereas others, such as carnation mottle virus, have a different sequence (Valle, 1989) .",

            "text": "As noted in Section I, ribosomal frameshifting alters the reading frame of mRNA during translation, resulting in the expression of a single protein from two or more overlapping genes. Ribosomal frameshifting may operate in one of two directions, altering the reading frame in either the 5' or 3' direction. This phenomenon is well known in bacteria and has been reviewed elsewhere (Dayhuff et al., 1986; Craigen and Caskey, 1987; R. B. Weiss et al., 1987; R. Weiss et al., 1988; Hughes et al., 1989; Atkins et al., 1990; Murgola, 1990) . In eukaryotes, a shift in the reading frame in the 3' direction has been described thus far only in yeast, whereas that in the 5' direction has been described in yeast, plants, and animals. For example, the retrovirus-like retrotransposon, Ty, and the double-stranded RNA viruslike particle, L-A, both contain two large overlapping reading frames that are aligned differently in yeast (for review see Wickner, 1989 ). In Ty, the different reading frames are aligned by a frameshift of one nucleotide in the 3' (or + l ) direction Clare et al., 19881 , whereas in L-A they are aligned by a frameshift of one nucleotide in the 5' (or -1) direction (Icho and Wickner, 1989; Dinman et al., 1991) . In higher eukaryotes, ribosomal frameshifting occurs or is suspected of occurring in the -1 direction in a number of mammalian and avian retroviruses, in the avian infektious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Brierley et al., 1987, 19891 , in certain pladt viruses (Miller et al., 1988; Xiong and Lommel, 19891 , in transposable elements in Drosophila, and in the mouse intracisternal A-particle (mouse IAP) (for reviews see Jacks, 1990; Hatfield et al., 1990a,b; Hatfield and Oroszlan, 1990) . In fact, the gag and pol genes of most vertebrate retroviruses occur in different reading frames and ribosomal frameshifting in the -1 direction is required to align the overlapping frames. Interestingly, as noted above, some of these retroviruses require two frameshift events, one between gag-pro and one between pro-pol, to express the Gag-Pro-Pol fusion protein (see Fig. 1 ).",

The fact that viral genes may be tandem, lie in different reading frames, and appear to be overlapping does not necessarily mean that they are expressed by ribosomal frameshifting, even though the gene organization may be analogous to that of other genetic systems utilizing frameshifting, and, for that matter, even though such genes are expressed as a fusion protein. For example, the cauliflower mosaic virus capsid protein and RT genes are tandem and lie in different reading frames, but RT is expressed separately from the capsid protein (see Schultze et al., 1990; Wurch et al., 1991, and references therein) . In addition, in the hepatitis B virus, the X and C genes are expressed as a fusion protein (where these genes may occur in different reading frames), but recent evidence suggests that this fusion protein is not synthesized by ribosomal frameshifting (see Lo et al., 1990, and references therein) .",

            "text": "Frameshifting in the -1 direction in eukaryotes was first demonstrated by Jacks and Varmus (19851, who reported that both the Gag protein and the Gag-Pol fusion protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) could be synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates programmed with a single species of RNA encoding the RSV gag gene and an adjacent portion of the downstream pol gene. The fact that both polypeptides were formed from a single species of RNA in approximately the same ratios as found in uiuo provided strong evidence that ribosomal frameshifting accounted for the alignment of the different reading frames in RSV. Ribosomal frameshifting was unequivocally demonstrated when the in uiuo-made transframe protein spanning the gag-pro overlap of MMTV was sequenced and found to contain amino acid residues that matched the corresponding nucleotide template, except for a shift by one nucleotide in the -1 direction (Hizi et al., 1987) . A detailed examination of the frameshift site, of information encoded in viral RNA for frameshifting, of possible models for frameshifting, of unique features of the frameshift site, and of the possible role of tRNA in frameshifting are presented below.

            "text": "A search of the overlapping regions within the gag-pol genes of retroviruses and the equivalent regions in other viruses and retroelements of higher organisms, including those in Drosophila and in the mouse IAP, each of which requires -1 frameshifting for alignment of different reading frames, reveals the occurrence of one of three common consensus sequences. As shown in Table I , the sequences are A AAC, U UUA, or U UUU, where AAC, UUA, and UUU decode asparagine, leucine, and phenylalanine, respectively, in the 0 frame (see also Jacks et al., 1988a) . It is of interest to note that IBV (Brierley et al., 1987) and two plant viruses, barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) (Miller et al., 1988) and RCNMV (Xiong and Lommel, 19891 , each contain one of the common sequences within the respective overlap shared by two different reading frames. As will be discussed in a later section, the signal for frameshifting that encompasses the common consensus sequence is actually a heptanucleotide, as shown in Table I. The frameshift site is the 3' base a t the end of the consensus sequence. This was most clearly demonstrated by sequencing the transframe peptide generated i n uitro from the RSV sequence, UUAUA (Jacks et al., 1988a1 , where UUA is a leucine codon that is read inthe gag frame and is part of the u UUA consensus sequence, and the pro-pol sequence of HTLV-1, AACCA (Nam et al., 19911, where AAC is an asparagine codon that is readin the pro frame and is part of the A AAC consensus sequence (see Table I ). As shown in Fig. 5 , leucine and isoleucine were generated from the UUAUA RSV sequence, and thus the UUA codon was read as leucine in thegag (or 0 ) frame and the AUA codon was read as isoleucine in the pol (or -1) frame. Likewise, &paragine and proline were generated from the HTLV-1 pro-pol AACCA sequence and thus AAC was decoded as asparagine in the pro frame, and -CCA was decoded as proline in the pol frame. These studies show Fic. 5. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the transframe proteins a t the frameshift site in selected retroviruses. Underlined nucleotides designate the frameshift signals. The amino acid sequences above the nucleotide sequences are translated from the 0 reading frame and those below are translated from the ~ 1 reading frame.

The transframe protein generated from this sequence contained lysine and asparagine (decoded by AAA and AAC, respectively, in the 0 frame), followed by leucine (decoded by either UUG in the 0 frame or -CUU in the -1 frame) and then valine (decoded by GUA in the -1 frame) (Hizi et al., 1987) , but due to overlapping Leu codons in the 0 and -1 frames, the precise site of the frameshift could not be determined.

(198813) observed that the shift occurred at a leucine residue corresponding to the Leu codon, UUA, which is part of the consensus sequence U UUA (Table I and Fig. 5) . However, both leucine and phenylalanine were present a t the position of the frameshift (in a ratio of 791, making assignment of the precise site uncertain. It is of interest to note that Weiss et al. (1989) translated the HIV frameshift signal in Escherichia coli cells, sequenced the resulting transframe peptide, and observed both leucine and phenylalanine at the frameshift site in a ratio of about 3:l. A similar analysis of the transframe peptide generated from the MMTV gag-pro frameshift signal, A AAA AAC, in E . coli yielded asparagine and lysine a t the frameshift site in a ratio of about 7:3 (Weiss et al., 1989) . These investigators proposed that a major shift occurred at the normal frameshift site Le., on the UUA codon in HIV and on the AAC codon in MMTV), whereas a minor shift occurred a t the immediate upstream codon (i.e., on the UUU codon in HIV-1 and on the AAA codon in MMTV) (see Fig. 5 ). Kingsman et al. (1990) have also considered the possibility that the HIV-1 U UUU UUA frameshift sequence is quite slippery (Wilson et al., 19881 , such that a minor shift that occurs at the upstream UUU codon would account for the occurrence of two amino acids at the frameshift site. Other possibilities that may account for the occurrence of two amino acids at the HIV frameshift site as observed by Jacks et al. (1988b) also warrant consideration. For example, Jacks et al. (1988b) proposed that a portion of the Leu-tRNA that is decoded by UUA a t the ribosomal A-site in the 0 frame may come off the ribosome after the slip to the -1 reading frame. This --event would expose the U U U codon, which then would be decoded by Phe-tRNA. Another possibility is that the frameshift site, which most certainly has unique features that make it slippery, may be more favorable to misreading such that Phe-tRNA misreads the leucine codon in HIV-1 and Lys-tRNA misreads the asparagine codon in MMTV prior to the frameshift (see further discussion on misreading within the frameshift signal in Section III,A,5).",

A transframe peptide derived from the naturally occurring HIV Gag-Pol fusion protein was sequenced (eight amino acids in length) and was found to contain Phe-Leu-Arg (L. Henderson, personal communication 19911, where Phe-Leu is read in the gag frame (decoded by U U U U U A ) and Arg is read in the pol frame (decoded by AGG, where A is the siteof the frameshift) (see Fig. 5 ).

Similarly, amino acid sequencing of the naturally occurring transframe protein of MMTV did not indicate microheterogeneity (Hizi et aZ., 19871 , but the possibility cannot be excluded here either.

Although these studies pinpoint the exact site of the frameshift, they do not determine how the different reading frames are aligned, i.e., whether alignment occurs by overlapping reading (where the base at the 3' end of the consensus sequence would be read twice) or by doublet decoding (where only two of three bases of the 0 frame codon within the consensus sequence would be read). However, an experiment by Jacks et al. (1988a) in which a single base change at the 3' end of the frameshift signal results in two new amino acids in the transframe peptide demonstrates that the alignment occurs by overlapping reading. Jacks et al. (1988a) changed the RSV U U A U A sequence, which codes for leucine in the 0 frame and isoleu-cine in the -1 frame, to UUUUA, where U is the altered base a t the 3' end of the frameshift signal (see Fig. 5 ,. The resulting transframe peptide generated from this sequence contained phenylalanine, which was decoded by UUU, and leucine, which was decoded by UUA (see Fig.  5 ). The base at the 3' end of the frameshift signal is therefore read twice, once in the 0 frame and once in the -1 frame; thus, the alignment of the different reading frames occurs by overlapping reading as originally proposed by Hizi et al.

Alteration of the first triplet to any identical three bases (i.e., G GG to C CC, A AA, or U UU) within the L-A frameshift signal maintained efficient frameshifting.

Alteration of the C in the MMTV gag-pro frameshift (A AAA AAC) signal to -U reduced the level of frameshifting severalfold, whereas changing this base to A or G was even more inhibitory, with the A AAA AAG sequence exhibiting the most severe inhibition. In contrast, changing the 3' terminal C in the MMTV gag-pro (homopolymeric A) frameshift signal to A or G increased, and did not decrease, the level of frameshifting in E . coli (Weiss et al., 1989) .

This conclusion is further supported by the observation that efficient frameshifting occurs when the heptanucleotide frameshift signal in IBV is altered such that it is flanked on both sides by a termination codon [i.e., when the codon immediately upstream in the -1 frame and that immediately downstream in the 0 frame of the heptanucleotide signal are stop codons (S.

            "text": "b. Information Downstream of the Frameshift Site. Not all of the information necessary for frameshifting is located within the heptanucleotide sequence shown in Table I . Initially, Jacks et al. (1987) demonstrated that the ability of the gag-pro and pro-pol overlaps of MMTV to promote frameshifting was lost when these regions were inserted into another genetic context. Thus, these two overlaps (which contain the heptanucleotide frameshift signal) are not sufficient in themselves to carry out frameshifting. Jacks et al. (1987) also suggested that potential stem-loop structures that occur just downstream of the overlaps in MMTV may provide the additional information required for the frameshift event (see above). The presence of a potentially stable RNA secondary structure just downstream of homopolymeric A sequences in the gag-pro overlaps of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and HTLV-1 was first noted by Rice et al. (1985) . Potential stem-loop structures occur just downstream of the frameshift sites or suspected sites in each overlapping region sequenced to date from higher eukaryotes (actually within 9 to 10 bases of the frameshift site in all cases; see Jacks, 1990; Kingsman et al., 1990) . Interestingly, in a survey of several hundred bases on either side of the frameshift site, Le et al. (1989) found that the most thermodynamically stable secondary structure was always a stem-loop located within several bases downstream of the frameshift site. Although the stem-loop structures vary considerably in size of both the stem and the loop, the type of configuration that can be generated, in base composition, and in stability, the striking conservation of their position suggests that they may have an important role in frameshifting. Several examples of possible stem-loop structures are shown in Fig. 6 .",

The role of the stem-loop structure and pseudoknot in IBV frameshifting has been examined in further detail (Brierley et al., 1991) . For efficient frameshifting in IBV, the two pseudoknot stems must be in close proximity to each other and must be essentially intact. However, small changes in the loops of the pseudoknot did not affect frameshifting. These investigators also observed that the pseudoknot could not be replaced by a simple stem-loop structure of similar overall size and composition; thus the pseudoknot conformation is a requirement for frameshifting.",

Furthermore, the stem-loop structures that occur immediately downstream of the frameshift signals or proposed frameshift signals in a number of retroviruses (ten Dam et d., 19901, as well as in murine coronavirus gene 1 (Lee et al., 19911 , are capable of forming a pseudoknot. In MMTV, the presence of a pseudoknot downstream of the gag-pro frameshift signal is required for optimal frame- shifting (Chamorro et al., 1992) . The occurrence and role of pseudoknots in retroviruses and in other RNA structures have been reviewed elsewhere (Schimmel, 1989; Wyatt et at., 1989; Pleij, 1990; ten Dam et al., 1990) . It is of interest t o note that the position of the stem-loop structure relative to the frameshift site is critical for efficient frameshifting, as has been carefully demonstrated for IBV (Brierley et al., 1989) . Altering the distance between the stem-loop structure and the frameshift site by as few as three bases in either direction inhibits frameshifting in IBV. Thus, it appears that the ribosomal frameshift event, at least in some retroviruses, requires a carefully positioned downstream stemloop structure that may, as in the case of IBV (Brierley et al., 1989) , exist as part of a pseudoknot.",

They observed that this sequence worked as efficiently in vitro (in rabbit reticulocyte lysates) as in vivo (in yeast cells) whether or not the downstream stem-loop structure was present. However, it should be noted that these experiments were not carried out under normal physiological conditions for HIV gag-pol expression. Recent in vivo studies (carried out in mammalian cells) provide evidence that the downstream stem-loop structure in HIV is required for optimal frameshifting (H.

These observations led Kingsman et at. (1990) to speculate that the homopolymeric A and U frameshift sequences (i.e., A AAA AA and U UUU UU) may be more slippery than other frameshift signals, and therefore that their requirements for a downstream stem-loop structure to aid the frameshift event may be less stringent. However, in eukaryotes the requirements for efficient frameshifting with a perfect homopolymeric A (i.e., all of the bases are As) sequence apparently are different from that of a perfect homopolymeric U sequence. Mutation of the 3' terminal C in the A AAA AAC frameshift signal to A (or to G) severely inhibits frameshifting (Chamorro et al., 1992) . In addition, Dinman et al. (1991) have observed that frameshifting in yeast was more efficient when the L-A frameshift signal contained homopolymeric pyrimidine sequences than when it contained homopolymeric purine sequences. Interestingly, in the study by Dinman et al. (19911, the most efficient frameshift signal contained six tandem U bases.",

The transframe peptide generated from the MMTV gag-pro frameshift signal (A AAA AAC) in E. coli with and without the downstream stem-loop structure was sequenced (Weiss et al., 1989) . Interestingly, asparagine occurred predominantly a t the frameshift site with the intact stem (in an approximate ratio of 3:l with lysine), whereas in the absence of the stem-loop, lysine occurred predominantly a t the frameshift site (in an approximate ratio of 2:l with asparagine). One interpretation of these results is that the stem specifically enhances frameshifting on the AAC codon, with a minor frameshift occurring on the upstream AAA codon, whereas in the absence of the stem, the major shift occurs on the first slippery codon, AAA, with a minor shift on the downstream AAC codon (Weiss et al., 1989) .

Following slippage, the ribosome is prepared to read the -1 frame; normal transfer of the peptidyl-tRNA to the aminoacyl-tRNA and its translocation to the P-site bring the first codon in the -1 frame to the A-site. Then, normal decoding of the A-site and transfer of the nascent peptide to the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA consummate reading in the -1 frame (Fig. 7A) .",

These studies strongly suggest that the six bases within the 0 frame of the signal span both the ribosomal A-and P-sites and the six bases within the -1 frame (following the slippage) also span the A-and P-sites. After the slip to the -1 frame has taken place, the aminoacyl-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA decode a new set of codons; the base sequence within the frameshift signal is such that a minimal amount of mismatching occurs (see Fig. 8 and Section III,A,5). Weiss et al. (1989) have proposed a somewhat different simultaneousslippage model for frameshifting based on their observations on translation of the retroviral homopolymeric A and U frameshift signals in E . coli. The major difference between the Jacks and Varmus model (for review see Jacks, 1990 ) and that of Weiss et al. is that the latter takes into account the probable presence of three sites on the ribosome, the aminoacyl-tRNA (A), the peptidyl (PI, and the exit (El sites, and the possibility that the shift occurs after peptide bond formation (see Fig.  7B ). The Jacks and Varmus model proposes that the frameshift occurs before peptide bond formation while the ribosome is stationary. Weiss et al. (1989) suggested that the downstream stem-loop structure may exert its influence during translocation of the 3' codon (within the frameshift signal) from the A-to P-site and the slip may occur while the tRNAs exist, albeit transiently, as hybrids in the E-IPand P-/A-sites immediately after peptide bond formation (see Fig. 7B and the legend for details).",

The observation that only three codons occurred at the ribosomal A-site and the finding that altering the consensus sequence within the frameshift signal to A AAA or G GGG inhibits frameshifting led these investigators to propose the existence of specialized \"shifty\" tRNAs that promote frameshifting (Jacks et al., 1988a) .

Thus, a question may be raised as to the cause of hypomodification of specific isoacceptors in the host tRNA population after viral infection. This question has been addressed previously by Katze and collaborators (19831, who considered a number of possibilities to explain a deprivation of Q base in tRNA in tumor cells. I t should be noted that Q base is obtained in the diet of mammals and is inserted in tRNA by an enzyme designated as queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase (tRNA-GRT). These investigators suggested that a deficiency of Q base in tumor cell tRNA occurs in part because the requirements for this base exceed the dietary intake. This may be due to an increase in tRNA turnover and growth rate, to an inefficient salvage pathway, andlor to the possible occurrence of inhibitors of tRNA-GRT. Of these possibilities, it is tempting to speculate that in retrovirus-infected cells, the metabolism of the host may be altered in response to viral infection such that the host produces a new metabolite or more of a given metabolite, which acts as an inhibitor of an enzyme involved in production of the hypermodified base within tRNA. For example, 7-methylguanine and pteridine occur in mammalian cells and these metabolites are inhibitors of tRNA-GRT (see Katze et al., 1983; French et al., 1991, and references therein) .",

Clearly, the lack of a hypermodified base in the anticodon loop of tRNA would create more space in and around the frameshift site; in turn, this might facilitate frameshifting by allowing greater flexibility of movement of the anticodon Hatfield and Oroszlan, 1990) . It is of interest to note that the presence of modified bases within the anticodon loop of tRNA restricts wobble, whereas their absence expands the decoding potential (Randerath et al., 1979; Bienz and Kubli, 1981; Beier et al., 1984a,b; Bjork et al., 1987 Bjork et al., , 1989 Wilson and Roe, 1989; Claesson et al., 1990) . More specifically, among these studies it has been shown that some tRNAs lacking a modified base in their anticodon promote frameshifting (Bjork et al., 1989) , whereas others promote misreading (Randerath et al., 1979; Bienz and Kubli, 1981; Beier et al., 1984a,b; Bjork et al., 1987; Wilson and Roe, 1989; Claesson et al., 1990) . In addition, with respect to tRNAs normally containing a Q or Wye base, the coding properties of tRNAs lacking Q base (Bienz and Kubli, 1981; Beier et al., 1984a,b; Bjork et al., 1987; Meier et al., 1985) and Wye base (Smith and Hatfield, 1986 ) differ from those of the corresponding fully modified isoacceptors. In light of these studies, it is tempting to speculate that the \"shifty\" tRNAs that promote frameshifting are hypomodified isoacceptors.",

            "text": "In the simultaneous-slippage model of frameshifting, the tRNAs involved must have a dual function. First, they must promote frameshifting, and then after the shift to the -1 frame, they must misread or read only two out of three bases of the new set of codons (see Fig. 8 ). Interestingly, the frameshift signals are designed to minimize misreading after the frameshift event. Within the heptanucleotide frameshift signals involved in a shift to the -1 reading frame (see Table I ), the bases in the first two positions of the downstream codon k e . , UU, AA, or GG) are identical to the base in the 3' position of the upstream codon (i.e., U, A, or G, respectively). The shift to the new reading frame, therefore, maintains similar codon-anticodon interactions provided the tRNAs in the ribosomal A-and P-sites misread the base in the 3' position of the -1 frame codon or read only two out of three bases. Codon-anticodon complexes within the various frameshift signals in retroviruses sequenced to date are summarized in Fig. 8 . The only exceptions to the presence of identical bases in the first two positions of the downstream codon and the terminal position of the upstream codon in the frameshift signals shown in Table I are in that of RCNMV and the pro-pol signal of MMTV. These two heptanucleotide signals contain an Asp codon, GAU, and a shift to the -1 reading frame results in Asp tRNA decoding a glycine codon, GGA. The shift onto the GGA codon requires that mismatching takes place between the first and second positions of the Asp tRNA anticodon and the middle and third positions of the corresponding codon as shown in Fig. 8 D. The frameshift site manifests several unique features. For example, only three naturally occurring codons (UUA, UUU, and AAC) have been found to occupy this site (Jacks et al., 1988a; Jacks, 1990) . Moreover, the site and the heptanucleotide sequence that encompasses the frameshift site constitute a slippery region such that the reading frame of the corresponding mRNA may be altered (Jacks et al., 1988a; Wilson et al., 1988; Weiss et at., 1989; Jacks, 1990; Kingsman et al., 1990 ). An additional feature of the frameshift site, in contrast to what occurs in normal translation, is that the same isoacceptor may decode one cognate codon more efficiently than another at this site. That is, tRNAPhe decodes UUU slightly more efficiently than UUC (Jacks et al., 1988a; Wilson et al., 1988; Weiss et al., 1989; Dinman et al., 1991) and tRNAAsn decodes AAC several times more efficiently than AAU (Chamorro et al., 1992) . InE. coli the same tRNALys decodes AAG a t the mutant MMTV gag-pol frameshift site about 20 times more efficiently than AAA (Weis et al., 1989) . Clearly, the frameshift site involves a form of misreading because the same isoacceptor presumably decodes these cognate codons with similar efficiencies at other mRNA sites. Meier et al. (1985) have shown that in the absence of Q base (G is in the wobble position of the anticodon), tRNAHi\" shows a strong preference for CAC codons, whereas tRNAHIs with Q base shows a slight preference for CAU codons. This study provides a model for Q-deficient tRNAs preferentially reading XAC codons, as is found in decoding the asparagine AACIAAU codon set a t the MMTV gag-pro wild-type and mutant frameshift sites (see above). Thus, it is possible that the frameshift site has a specific requirement for a hypomodified isoacceptor that can preferentially decode one of its cognate codons. In addition, because the frameshift site invokes misreading (at least among cognate tRNA codons), then in light of the observation that two amino acids may occur at the HIVgag-pol (Jacks et al., 1988b; Weiss et al., 1989) and MMTV gag-pro (Weiss et al., 1989) frameshift sites, a question can be raised whether the occurrence of two amino acids is caused by (1) frameshifting a t separate sites (as suggested in Weiss et al., 1989) or (2) a high level of misreading at a single frameshift site as a result of using heterologous systems (see also Section III,B,2).",

The Ty elements are a family of retrotransposons that are about 5.5 kilobases in length and are flanked by direct repeats of 330-340 bp designated delta sequences in Tyl and Ty2 and sigma sequences in Ty3. The Ty elements replicate through a DNA intermediate in a fashion similar to retrovirus replication and Ty occurs within viruslike particles designated Ty-VLPs. The Ty proteins of the VLP coat are encoded within TYA, which is analogous to the retroviral gag gene: the Ty PR, RT, and IN are encoded within TYB, which is analogous to the retroviral pol gene (for reviews see Wickner, 1989; Garfinkel, 1991) . T Y A and TYB overlap each other by 38-44 bp and the TYB reading frame is offset from TYA by one base in the 3' direction. TYB is expressed as a fusion protein with the TYA gene product, and expression of the fusion protein requires ribosomal frameshifting in the + 1 direction (Clare and Farabaugh, 1985; Mellor et al., 1985; Wilson et al., 1986; Clare et al., 1988; Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990;  S. Sandmeyer, personal communication 1991 1. Thus, expression of TYA-TYB is like that observed in retroviruses with the exception that circumventing the termination codon at the end of the TYA (gag) gene is effected by ribosomal frameshifting in the + 1 instead of the -1 direction.",

Thus, the frameshift in Tyl involves a slippage from one leucine codon in the 0 reading frame to an overlapping leucine codon in the + 1 reading frame ; see also below) and the site of the frameshift is the 3' base of the downstream overlapping leucine codon.",

            "text": "The heptanucleotide frameshift signal in Tyl (CUU AGG C) has two unusual features. First, as noted above, it contains overlapping leucine codons in the 0 (CUU) and +1 (UUA) reading frames. Second, the arginine codon AGG within the frameshift signal is normally decoded by a tRNA, tRNA&&, which is present in low amounts in the host cell (lkemura, 1982) . Belcourt and Farabaugh (1990) demonstrated that increasing the intracellular levels of tRNA&& in yeast decreases the level of frameshifting in Tyl, providing strong evidence that the absence of this tRNA from the ribosomal A-site enhances the frameshift event. These investigators also determined that slippage from the first to the overlapping, downstream leucine codon is essential to the frameshift event and presumably occurs with peptidyl-tRNAL'\" . They introduced a leucine tRNA gene with anticodon AAG into the host, whose gene product could decode CUU but not UUA codons. Transfer RNAk& would be expected to compete with the \"shifty\" tRNA, tRNAPzG, which is capable of reading all six leucine codons (Weissenbach et al., 1977) . The level of frameshifting in Ty was severely inhibited by tRNAki%, demonstrating that slippage from CUU to UUA is essential for frameshifting in Ty. These observations led Belcourt and Farabaugh (1990) to propose a \"peptidyl-tRNA slippage\" model for frameshifting in the + 1 direction in Ty. In this model, the relatively low abundance of tRNAcAifir results in a pause in translation a t an AGG codon. If this codon partially overlaps an upstream slippery CUUA sequence, then in the absence of an occupied A-site, the peptidyl-tRNA&Y; (which is on the CUU codon in the P-site) slips one base foward to decode UUA. The slippage event establishes the + l reading frame and normal translation then proceeds ).",

Sandmeyer, personal communication 1991 1. Candidates for the frameshift signal within the 21-bp region involve a n alanine GCG codon and an arginine CGA codon, which are used infrequently in yeast (and hence their cognate isoacceptors are present in low abundance) (see Ikemura, 1982) . Either one of these codons may serve a similar function as AGG in the Tyl frameshift signal. The codon immediately upstream of GCG is AAG ( a lysine codon) and that of CGA is AAC (an asparagine codon), and a change to the + l reading frame would mean that either tRNhL& slips to misread GGA or tRNA(& slips to misread ACC. With respect to the latter tRNA it is of interest to note that yeast tRNA lacks the highly modified Q base in the anticodon; as noted in Section 111,A,5, tRNAA\"\" without Q base is proposed as the shifty isoacceptor in some of the -1 frameshift events. Ultimately, however, the site of the frameshift in Ty3 will have to be identified by mutagenesis studies and by sequencing the transframe protein.",
