Noncommunicable diseases fall into this group; they may not have garnered as much interest or importance over the past 10 or 20 years, but in fact have been affecting public health around the world in a very steady and critical way, becoming the leading cause of death in both developed and developing countries. 1 This article discusses emergent issues in global health related to noncommunicable diseases and conditions. Trying to offer an in-depth discussion on such a wide range of issues in just one article is clearly not possible, and therefore focus and emphasis is given to defining the unique epidemiologic features and relevant programmatic, health systems, and policy responses concerning noncommunicable chronic diseases (NCDs), mental health, accidents and injuries, urbanization, climate change, and disaster preparedness.",

NCDs cause 60% of all global deaths but receive just 2.3% of international development assistance for health. Approximately 80% of deaths caused by NCDs occur in developing countries, generally in a younger population than those in high-income countries. 1, 2 Over the next 10 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that NCD deaths will increase by 17% globally with the greatest increases in the African (27%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (25%) regions. In terms of the highest absolute number of deaths, the Western Pacific and South-East Asia are projected to lead the field. 3 Noncommunicable diseases are a group of illnesses and include those conditions that have been identified as the leading causes of death around the world: heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. These diseases are characterized by their long latency period often influenced by exposure to risk factors for extended periods over a patient's lifetime. The situation becomes more acute with the addition of the word \"chronic,\" indicating that these diseases are mostly incurable and the duration of treatment may cover decades of a person's life.",

There is very little that can be done about some risk factors, such as age and genetic inheritance, and increasing evidence suggests that what happens before a person is born and during early childhood plays a key role in the onset of adult chronic disease, demonstrated by the proven association between low birth weight and increased rates of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. 6 However, the most common chronic diseases share some of the same highly preventable or avoidable risk factors including physical inactivity, tobacco use, and obesity, leading researchers to study mortality for NCDs by risk factor. The WHO estimates that each year approximately 4.9 million people die from tobacco use, 2.6 million from being overweight or obese, 4.4 million as a result of raised cholesterol levels, and 7.1 million as a result of raised blood pressure. 1 Raised cholesterol and raised blood pressure (hypertension) are particularly dangerous risk factors because they can exist in an individual for a long time without presenting any obvious symptoms.",

            "text": "In its seminal book Preventing Chronic Disease: A Vital Investment, the WHO presents what it defines as effective and feasible interventions to reduce the threat of NCDs, with low-income and middle-income countries being specifically targeted. 1 The WHO seeks ideally to reduce the burden of NCD mortality by 2% per year through the implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which was the first global treaty negotiated by the WHO in 2003. As of 2010 it had been signed by 168 nations, although stages of ratification vary. The FCTC contains guidelines for implementing demand-reducing policies toward tobacco including health policies aimed at protecting the public with respect to commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry, protection from exposure to tobacco smoke, packaging and labeling of tobacco products; and limits or bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship. 7 Tax increases for tobacco control are considered to be clinically effective and very cost-effective relative to other health interventions, 8 while the implementation of smoking bans in public areas appears to reduce the risk of heart attacks significantly, particularly among younger individuals and nonsmokers, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (September 29, 2009 issue). Researchers reported that smoking bans can reduce the number of heart attacks by as much as 26% per year. 9, 10 Policy level programs are also being discussed for reducing salt and sugared beverages 11, 12 in the diet, consumer products, and food outlets. The WHO report also encourages screening for which there are clear public health benefits and cost benefit, and in situations in which the ability to treat the condition (such as raised blood pressure and cervical cancer) exists. 1 However, at present the quality and quantity of research investigating the actual benefits of different intervention programs to prevent noncommunicable diseases in developing countries is sparse and exists primarily as case studies. 1, 11 Low-income and middle-income countries have developed their health provision and policies according to a primary care or Alma Ata model, focused on meeting the needs of pregnant women and children younger than 5 years, and developing services for a variety of high-impact communicable diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The health systems in these countries are unprepared to deal with risk-factor education and behavior modification for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of NCDs, or the long-term management of these conditions. Despite growing interest among the population and health system leadership, one high-ranking health official pointed out that Currently, donor countries are operating a policy ban on funding NCDs, thereby starving low-income governments of the financial and technical assistance needed to turn around the NCD epidemic. This policy has to change, with overseas development assistance aligned to the priorities of recipient countries. 3 ",

            "text": "Since 1946, the WHO has defined health as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" 18 However, mental illness and related conditions have never received the same importance or consideration as other areas of health despite their enormous burden on the population. This fact is exemplified by the routine exclusion of mental health services from Primary Health Care (PHC) and the absence of any mental health-related objectives in the MDGs. 19, 20 Mental illnesses, including behavioral, neurologic, and substance use disorders, affect a significant number of the world's population. In 2002, the WHO estimated that globally 154 million people suffered from depression, 25 million from schizophrenia, and 15 million from substance use disorders, with around 877,000 people committing suicide every year. 21 In the same year, unipolar depressive disorders were ranked as fourth in terms of burden of disease, 22 well on the way to prove the 1990 prediction of the GBD analysis that estimated mental illness, specifically unipolar major depression, would become the second leading cause of burden of disease by 2020, second only to ischemic heart disease. 17 Studies in PHC settings in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, France, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe revealed that the prevalence of mental illness ranges between 10% and 60% among adults, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] with depression being the most common ranging from 5% to 20%, followed by generalized anxiety disorders (4%-15%) and dependency on addictive substances (5%-15%). [31] [32] [33] Children are not immune to mental health problems, with those aged between 6 and 14 years exhibiting a prevalence of mental illness of between 20% and 30%, 34,35 the most common diagnoses being anxiety disorders, major depression, behavioral disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 28, 35 Mental illness has an effect on other family members, which is seen clearly in a study looking at growth rates of children with mothers suffering from mental illness. The study showed that 20% of these children suffered from stunted growth, which could have been averted if interventions to treat the maternal depression had been performed. 28, 35 Individuals suffering from severe form of depression are at increased risk of attempting suicide, 36 as are women who experience abuse. 37 Meanwhile, the prevalence of mental health problems among elderly people is 33%, the majority of whom suffer from depression. 38, 39 Cost-effective treatment for most mental illnesses exists and, if correctly applied, most patients become functioning members of society, leading normal lives even in low-resource areas, and suicide risk is reduced. 40 Of interest, poverty indicators are related to mental disorders 41-44 with low education level being the most influential determinant. 45 Extrapolating these data, it is feasible to suggest that developing countries with low education levels will tend to have a higher proportion of the population suffering from mental health problems. Despite this, however, most low-income and middle-income countries spend less than 1% of their health expenditure on mental health. Explicit mental health policy, legislation, mental health treatment facilities, and community care are all lacking. 21 ",

Vulnerable road users account for 46% of deaths, and in low-income countries pedestrians account for nearly half of all road accident-related deaths. 48 There are proven interventions that can lead to a reduction in the amount of road traffic deaths and injuries. Such measures include controlling or reducing the speed of traffic with speed bumps or low-speed zones in urban areas, establishing and enforcing blood alcohol concentration limits, enforcing the use of helmets for both riders and passengers on motorcycles, and enforcing the use of seat belts, infant seats, and child booster seats. 47 The wearing of seatbelts in automobiles can reduce front-seat passenger deaths by 40% to 65% and rear-seat passenger deaths by 25% to 75%; however, only 57% of countries require the wearing of seat belts by all passengers. 47 The problem is that because of the high numbers of both people and different types of vehicles in developing countries and the lack of resources to police traffic effectively, traffic laws are not easily enforced, despite evidence showing the benefit of specific interventions in the reduction of traffic-related morbidity and mortality. 49 ",

With great shifts in industrialization from the developed to the developing countries, it is logical that the highest number of occupational injuries is shifting in the same way toward the developing world. However, it is very likely that published figures are underestimated, with numbers probably being 10% below the actual figure for the United States and as much as 85% for some locations such as rural Africa. 50, 51 Although several factors come into play when analyzing the causes of underreporting in developing countries, one of the main reasons is the lack of adequate data. 52 Determining the actual prevalence of occupational injury is critical for several reasons: (1) to provide accurate data to health providers, policy makers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the public; (2) to provide baseline data against which to measure interventions; (3) to aid priority setting and targeting for policy change and interventions; and (4) to estimate societal costs of rising occupational injuries. Tools to capture occupational injury have been designed and widely circulated by the UN's specialized agency, the International Labour Organization.

            "text": "In many developing countries, there is a lack of policy for or enforcement of safe working environments, which naturally means that wood cutting, mining, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing are more hazardous than in developed countries. The developed world has accepted that poor working conditions and practices are unacceptable and has legislated against them, leading to a reduction in occupational injuries over the past century. However, it seems that globally the same care has not been forthcoming, and developing countries have taken on the burden of heavy industry and poor working conditions that generate increases in occupational injuries. This trend is perfectly exemplified by the phrase \"export of hazard\" to describe when an outdated and dangerous technology is relocated from a high-income country to a developing country, despite the knowledge that the risk of injury with this technology is high. 57 Cost of production plays a key role in maintaining poor working conditions, and many industries in developing countries manage cost control through the use of manual labor, which is cheaper than the infrastructure and equipment needed to upgrade a process that produces the same amount of product at a much safer level. Manual labor is particularly exploited in the construction industry in developing countries, which have a disproportionate number of deaths from workers falling and injuries from falling objects. Working conditions at all levels of commerce are also full of risk factors to health, from the lack of ergonomically designed offices to avoid back injuries and repetitive stress disorders, to building materials used in construction, which may offer a long-term risk of health problems. The latter is of particular concern in many low-income and middle-income countries, with construction still making use of asbestos despite the documented links to lung cancer. 58, 59 URBANIZATION Urbanization is a major public health challenge for the twenty-first century, with significant changes in our living standards, lifestyles, social behavior, and health. Previously more of a phenomenon in developed countries; it is now taking hold and being seen at a greater level in developing countries. 60 The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) predicts that over the next 2 to 3 decades, almost all the world's population growth will be in urban areas in developing countries. 61 WHO figures for the period 1995 to 2005 already show an alarming increase in urban population growth, with developing countries' urban areas growing at an average of 1.2 million people per week or around 165,000 people every day. 60 While urban settings offer many opportunities including access to better health care, they can affect existing health risks and introduce new health hazards. The living and working conditions of those living in rapidly expanding and poorly planned urban areas often experience risks to health in some of the most basic areas such as unsafe drinking water, unsanitary conditions, poor housing, overcrowding, hazardous locations, and exposure to extremes of temperature. These increases in health risks are particularly critical for those most vulnerable: children younger than 5 years, infants, and the elderly. 60, 62 The rapid growth of urban settlements is often due to poor economic performance of the area in question and lack of urban planning and regulation, which has resulted in an increase in the number and size of informal settlements or slums in many cities. It is estimated that in the developing regions, more than 70% of urban residents live in slums. 61 The Urban Health Situation",

Child mortality is already high in the urban areas of developing regions. In Nairobi, where 60% of the city's population lives in slums, child mortality in these slums is 2.5 times greater than in other areas of the city. 63 Evidence from various surveys and studies points to a heavier burden of diseases such as diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory diseases, malnutrition among children, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, diabetes, and obesity on the urban poor. 60, 61, 64 Migration, increased mobility, changes in the ecology of urban environment, high population density, poor housing, and poor provision of basic services all act as pathways for emerging and reemerging communicable diseases. 61, 62 The consequence of these changes is evident in the spread of multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis that is placing the urban poor of India, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Nepal at a higher Global Health risk. Vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria are also increasing in many urban areas, due to migration, climate change, stagnant water, insufficient drainage, flooding, and improper disposal of solid waste. 61, 62 Unhealthy lifestyles characterized by unhealthy nutrition, reduced physical activity, and tobacco consumption due to rapid and unplanned urbanization are associated with common modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. 60 Urban environments tend to discourage physical activity and promote unhealthy food consumption. Overcrowding, heavy use of motorized transport, poor air quality, and lack of safe public spaces are some urban factors that restrict participation in physical activities. In the larger populated cities of Asia obesity is becoming a significant problem, and the rapid transition of diets in developing countries is typified by the coexistence of child malnutrition and maternal obesity in the same household. One of the main factors identified as causing an increase in diabetes worldwide is the change in traditional diets caused by urbanization. 65 Urbanization is exacerbating the health risks in terms of traffic accidents, injuries on the street or in the home, and mental health problems. The changes in climate and rising sea levels work toward increasing urbanization, with 600 million people living in the low-elevation coastal zones being at heightened risk of flooding, which will lead to migration to higher elevations and larger cities. 61 Adopting preventive measures to control communicable diseases, upgrading the infrastructure of existing health facilities, increasing human resource capacity, and taking appropriate measures for providing equitable health services to all, especially the most vulnerable groups, are vital for improving urban health.

            "text": "Climate change is an emerging threat to global public health. It is now widely accepted that climate change is occurring as a result of emission of greenhouse gases, especially from fossil-fuel combustion. 66 Climate change is predicted to affect many natural systems and habitats, for example, increasing the frequency and intensity of heat waves, increasing the number of floods and droughts, altering the geographic range and seasonality of certain infectious diseases, and disturbing food-producing ecosystems, 67 which in turn will affect human health both directly and indirectly. Direct health effects include changes in mortality and morbidity, and changes in respiratory diseases from heat waves. In terms of indirect health effects, these are much more extensive and include changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases, the nutritional and health consequences of regional changes in agricultural productivity, and the various consequences of rising sea levels, flooding, and droughts. [66] [67] [68] Climate change is highly inequitable, and the paradox is that those at greatest risk are the poorest populations in developing countries who have contributed least to Koehlmoos et al greenhouse gas emissions. However, the rapid economic development and concurrent pollution means that developing countries are now vulnerable to adverse health effects from climate change and, simultaneously, are becoming an increasing contributor to the problem. 67, 69 Although the effects of climate change affect all levels and ages of any single population, the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions are seen as being the most vulnerable. Conversely, major diseases that are most sensitive to climate change such as diarrhea, malaria, and infection associated with malnutrition are most serious in children living in poverty, making them highly vulnerable to the resulting disease burden. 67 Heat waves are expected to increase the occurrence of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, and aggravate existing conditions related to circulatory, respiratory, and nervous system problems, especially among the elderly. 67, 68 In 2003, a major heat wave affected most of Western Europe and caused 2000 additional deaths in England and Wales. 68 Another consequence of high temperatures is that they raise the levels of ozone and other air pollutants, which in turn aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma.",

Vector-borne diseases currently kill approximately 1.1 million people each year while 2.2 million die from diarrheal diseases. 71 Studies suggest that by 2030, climate change may put 170 million people in Africa at risk of malaria, 67, 72 and by the 2080s the global population at risk of dengue is likely to increase to 2 billion. 67, 73 Recent published data provides evidence of an association between the El Ni\u00f1 o and La Ni\u00f1 a phenomena, which are major determinants of global weather patterns, and some infectious diseases. Evidence shows that there is an association between El Ni\u00f1 o and malaria epidemics in parts of South Asia and South America, and with cholera in coastal areas of Bangladesh. 68, 74 Studies of malaria have already revealed the health impacts of climate variability associated with El Ni\u00f1 o, including large epidemics on the Indian subcontinent, Colombia, Venezuela, and Uganda. 75 One of the most immediate problems related to changes in climate and climate patterns is that on food production and availability. Each year approximately 3.5 million people, mostly children from developing countries, die from malnutrition and related diseases. It is projected that climate change will decrease agricultural production in many tropical developing regions, thus putting tens of millions more people at risk of food insecurity and adverse health consequences of malnutrition. 67 Disasters in certain areas of high food production will also affect global prices, thereby affecting not only those people living in the affected region but others around the world who depend on food produced from that region.",

The estimated effects are predicted to be most severe in those regions that already have the greatest disease burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes, such as malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria. 17, 67, 71 Many of the projected impacts on health are avoidable, and public health policy makers need to act to reduce or negate the impact caused by climate change through a combination of short-term public health interventions that aim to adapt measures in health-related sectors, such as agriculture and water management, and long-term strategy. The most effective responses are likely to be strengthening of the key functions of environmental management, surveillance and response to protect health from natural disasters and changes in infectious disease patterns, and strengthening of the existing public health systems. 67, 68 However, countries need to assess their main health vulnerabilities and prioritize adoptive action accordingly, keeping in mind the costs involved.",

            "text": "Following a disaster, some populations suffer more acutely than others. It is worth considering the complex issues of how societies organize themselves in terms of risk and actual prevention and care, for access to clean water and sanitation, and how they communicate and initiate behavioral change among the displaced or fragile populations. At the forefront of most discussions when planning post-disaster management and action is the priority placed on certain elements of disaster relief, such as the building of embankments, the distance to clean water, or the time from incident to response. Recent examples of varying responses and outcomes were seen following the two cyclones in South Asia. There was a relative success in Bangladesh in terms of lives saved and response coordination after Cyclone Sidr in November 2007, compared with the devastating loss of more than 100,000 lives after Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in May 2008, not to mention the loss of draft animals and dykes, and the flooding of fields during planting season. 76 Bangladesh reverted to its welldeveloped program for DRR that includes national-level coordination, whereas in Myanmar there was no national platform for disaster preparedness, and delays occurred in the coordination of international response to the disaster. In addition to the immediate and obvious impact of natural disasters, conditions often worsen in poorly coordinated settings, as evidenced in 2010 when Vibrio cholerae emerged in post-flood Pakistan, and for the first time since the 1960s in post-earthquake Haiti. 77 In general, there are 7 factors that can turn a natural disaster into a complex disaster regardless of the severity or magnitude of the initiating event such as a hurricane, earthquake, or tsunami. According to the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs, the 7 factors are: poverty, ungoverned population growth, rapid urbanization and migration, transitional cultural practices, environmental degradation, lack of awareness and information, and war and civil strife. 78 Poverty is by far the single greatest factor that contributes to the vulnerability of a population to complex disasters. In addition to lacking financial resources to prepare for or recover from a disaster, impoverished people are also more likely to have low levels of education and low amounts of political influence to properly deal with a disaster situation. In addition to increases in birth rates, rapid population growth can be the consequence of urbanization or migration. Population growth without limits produces a population that is more likely to settle in areas that are unsuitable or at risk for natural disasters, meaning that more people are at risk of disease and, most importantly, are more likely to undergo civil strife while competing for scarce resources.",

Empirical evidence linking disaster risk to poverty tends to come from microstudies within one community, making it impossible to generate generalized findings across regions or entire countries. 80 Prompted by the devastation that followed the tsunami on 26 December, 2004, there was widespread acceptance that an early-warning system should be installed and other actions taken to prevent loss of life where possible. The World Conference on Disaster Reduction was held in Japan in January 2005, and resulted in the creation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (HFA), which was endorsed by 168 UN member states and urges all countries to make major efforts to reduce their disaster risk by 2015. The HFA outlines the need to increase awareness and understanding about DRR, the importance of knowing the real and potential risks, and taking action against them. Specific recommendations included the need to create or enhance early-warning systems, build DRR into education, and reduce risk factors such as deforestation, unstable housing, and the location of communities in risk-prone areas.",

Drug resistance in treating many diseases and illnesses is a major concern, as witnessed in malaria and tuberculosis, and with a highly mobile world population, global pandemics such as SARS, H5N1, and H1N1, for which treatments either are not available or levels of suitable drug are clearly not sufficient for a worldwide epidemic, are proving to be very challenging. This clear inability to predict and maintain sufficient levels of treatment for potential threats makes health risk reduction extremely difficult, and in developing countries where resources are already stretched to cope with existing health issues, creating effective programs will require intervention from social partners, global support organizations, and aid from the developed world. An ever quickening pace of globalization means that public health-related problems in one area of the world will have an impact on those living in another area and therefore, it is in everyone's interest to ensure that all countries, irrespective of their economic development and available resources, are sufficiently supported to maintain and review strategies that will effectively reduce morbidity and mortality rates in all spheres of public health.",
