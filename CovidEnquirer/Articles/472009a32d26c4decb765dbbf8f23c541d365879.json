These cells can remain latent or be triggered into one of the other two outcomes at a future time. A classic example of latency is the herpes virus, which can remain dormant until a trigger such as stress activates the virus and a characteristic herpetic skin lesion is produced. In the controlled growth outcome, the host cell is not destroyed but becomes committed to the production of new virions, which are gradually released into the surrounding interstitial space. The last outcome, lysis, involves destruction of the host cell upon release of the newly formed virions. This process is referred to as the cytopathic effect and often results in patterned tissue damage that can be used in the clinical laboratory for identification of the virus (Strodtbeck, 1986; Voyles, 1993) .",

The rise in fetal IgM during intrauterine infection allows fetal or cord blood levels to be used in the diagnosis of congenital viral infection.

In the developing fetus, this can worsen the severity of birth defects associated with specific viral diseases, such as rubella or cytomegalovirus (CMV).

The presence of physical findings, such as characteristic rashes or vesicles, microcephaly, intrauterine growth retardation or small size for gestational age, should alert the nurse to the possibility of congenital infection. Obtaining a detailed, accurate maternal history, including immunizations received, signs/symptoms of possible viral illness during the pregnancy, and exposure to possible sources of viral infection, is important.

General nursing care may involve ventilator therapy, pharmacologic support of cardiovascular status, correction of acidosis and shock states, correction of coagulopathies, and treatment of severe neurologic disorders, such as meningitis and seizures. Skin care and nutrition are other areas of concern to nursing because many infants may have rashes or be at risk for secondary infections. Care of the family is important and can be complicated by maternal or paternal feelings of guilt regarding congenital infection or infection acquired at the time of delivery. The need for special care such as isolation also can present problems and increase the family's stress. Meticulous attention to hand washing, aseptic technique, and the use of personal protective equipment are additional important aspects of nursing care. These last strat-",

Although the newborn immune system is capable of mounting a defense to the virus, the response often is inadequate for preventing infection. The outcome of viral infection depends upon the specific virus, the gestational age of the newborn at the onset of infection, and the severity of the infection.
