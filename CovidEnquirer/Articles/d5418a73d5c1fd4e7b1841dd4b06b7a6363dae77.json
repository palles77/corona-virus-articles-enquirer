China's health aid deploys medical teams, constructs facilities, donates drugs and equipment, trains personnel, and supports malaria control mainly in Africa and Asia. Prompted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, China has prioritised the control of cross-border transmission of infectious diseases and other health-related risks. In governance, China has joined UN and related international bodies and has begun to contribute to pooled multilateral funds. China is both a knowledge producer and sharer, off ering lessons based on its health accomplishments, traditional Chinese medicine, and research and development investment in drug discovery. Global health capacity is being developed in medical universities in China, which also train foreign medical students. China's approach to global health is distinctive; diff erent from other countries; and based on its unique history, comparative strength, and policies driven by several governmental ministries. The scope and depth of China's global engagement are likely to grow and reshape the contours of global health.",

With 18% of the world's population, China weighs heavily in all global health metrics, such as life expectancy, disease burden, and health systems. As the world's largest trading nation, its movement of goods and services is associated with transfer of health technologies, diseases, and risk factors.

Strange and coauthors 6 estimated all previous estimates of Chinese development fi nance to Africa. The State Council of the Chinese Government, the highest body of state administration, published white papers summ arising China's overall foreign aid in 2011 and 2014. None of the above estimations disaggregated or separately reported health aid. 7, 8 We thus have resorted to an extensive search of data from multiple Chinese sources-the State Council, the ministries of health, commerce, education, foreign aff airs, and science and technology. Reports from provincial governments, Chinese embassies abroad, and the press were searched. Altogether, we obtained data from 529 sources-425 from various websites, 70 from statistical yearbooks, 23 from regular reports, and 15 from newspapers. Data sourced came from 15 groups of organisations, including 227 sources from the ministry of commerce, 35 from the health ministry (National Health and Family Planning Commission), and 15 from ministry of education. The overwhelming proportion of these data sources are in Chinese (95%), with less than 5% in English. All data sources are shown in the appendix. Interviews were done with dozens of former offi cials, medical team members, and key provincial authorities to collect fi rst-hand information.",

            "text": "China's participation in global health has deep historical roots, not only just in recent years. In the fi rst millennium, knowledge of medical cures were transmitted by the Silk Road that facilitated exchange between China, India, the Middle East, and Europe. 9 In the 20th century, some Chinese health crises such as the Manchurian plague epidemic captured the attention of neighbouring countries of the international community. 10 China has historically been the origin of many infectious epidemics and a source of key health innovations of breakthroughs such as the barefoot doctor (a term that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, which refers to farmers who received minimal basic medical and paramedical training and worked in rural China to promote basic hygiene, preventive health care, family planning, and treat common illnesses. The name comes from southern farmers, who would often work barefoot in the rice paddies), and artemisinin, an eff ective antimalaria drug developed from plant-based Chinese traditional medicine. 11, 12 Because there is no universal consensus for the defi nition of global health, some approaches focus on transnational health risks, which lie beyond the reach of national governments, whereas other approaches stress the global commitment and responsibility to address health inequities and to support health. 13 We have adopted a framework of global health as characterised by health and related transnational fl ows of diseases, people, money, knowledge, technologies, and ethical values. [14] [15] [16] Four domains capture these globalisation processes (fi gure 1). First, health aid aims to advance global health equity. It is the traditional area of offi cial development assistance (ODA) coordinated by organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) countries. Second, global health security should be ensured by management of interdependence in global health and mutual protection against shared and transferred risks, such as epidemic diseases. Third, health governance is needed for global stewardship to set ground rules as mediated by health diplomacy. Fourth, knowledge exchange is needed, which includes the sharing of lessons and knowledge production, ownership, and application worldwide. Knowledge centrally aff ects all four pillars of global health, and global health governance is recognised to be central to all four domains (fi gure 1).",

            "text": "On the basis of this framework, China's modern timeline might be demarcated by fi ve landmarks. First, in 1963, China sent its fi rst overseas medical team to Algeria, followed 6 years later by the donation of its fi rst hospital in Tanzania. 17 The explicitly articulated purpose of China's health aid was to further political solidarity as part of China's foreign policy. Second was China's economic openings after 1978, which launched the dramatic transformation of China from a low-income to a middle-income country, leading to China qualifying as an aid recipient followed by increasingly becoming an aid donor. 17 Third, starting from 2000, China has hosted a series of Forums on China-Africa Cooperation, with each forum announcing yet another major aid pledge-eg, hospital construction, malaria control, and high education scholarships (2007-09); training of health workers and artemisinin drug donation (2010-12); and brightness action (eye care) campaign (2013-15). 18, 19 Fourth, global engagement greatly accelerated after 2001 when China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO), an event that marked China's joining almost all international bodies. Finally, and perhaps most dramatically, the 2003 severe acute repiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic underscored both China's neglect of its health sector and the reality that China's global trade cannot be done without mutual health protection. 20",

The 2011 white paper reports foreign aid of US$37\u00b76 billion accumulated up to and including 2009 in three categories: grants of $15\u00b76 billion; concessional loans of $10\u00b78 billion; and interest-free loans of $11\u00b72 billion. This amount is fairly close to another estimate of China's foreign aid at $40\u00b75 billion cumulative from 1950 to 2010, reaching $3\u00b79 billion annually by 2010. 21, 22 The aid increased signifi cantly during the period of 2010-12, reaching an average of $4\u00b78 billion per year, of which the grants accounted for 36\u00b72%. 8 Figure 2 shows that African countries received 46% of all aid, with Asia receiving about a third (33%) and Latin America receiving around 13%, before the end of 2009. The share for African countries increased to 51\u00b78% during the past 3 years, whereas Latin America received relatively less. 8 Another estimate computed China aid to Africa in 2008, at $1\u00b72 billion in comparison with Japan at $1\u00b76 billion and USA at $7\u00b72 billion. 22 Chinese aid in health is provided in fi ve categories: medical teams, construction of hospitals, donation of drugs and equipment, training of health personnel, and malaria control. The largest share of health aid is spent on medical teams and donated facilities. The fi nancial value of Chinese in-kind health aid is diffi cult to estimate. Crudely, from 2007 to 2011, we estimated the value of Chinese medical teams in Africa to be about $60 million annually, with donated facilities at a similar amount. Total health aid to Africa annually has been estimated at about $150 million. Understanding of the type of health support off ered rather than the precise volume of funding might be more important. Diff erent from most OECD donors, China does not off er general sectoral support, albeit small cash grants given to several countries in recent years. Its health aid uses a project approach. 7 The in-kind provision in the fi ve categories is based on Chinese competencies. Health seems to constitute only a small proportion of the total Chinese aid. Health aid is mainly in donation form, whereas most of China's overall foreign aid is off ered as either concessional or interest-free loans.",

A comprehensive analysis of this question would need access to data not currently available. As a preliminary fi rst step, we attempted to examine correlations between health aid and commercial economic indicators. Regression analysis of African countries with variables of health aid (medical teams, donated facilities, malaria control) and economic interests (petroleum imports, China's foreign investment, and China's imports and exports) yielded no signifi cant pattern. Figure 4 shows four scatter-plots of China health aid and African trade. In the four diagrams, individual African countries are plotted according to health and commercial indicators. The scatter-plots did not show any association between medical aid and economic interests.

Chinese errors made in the early stage of SARS have been acknowledged and have generated strong corrective measures, both domestically and internationally. 28 Domestic measures include major re-investment in the public health system via the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including development of the world's largest real-time electronic surveillance system. 29 International eff orts include active participation and leadership in many international forums that foster cooperation in compliance of disease reporting and control, as shown by the initiation of the UN resolution on enhancement of capacity-building in global public health in 2003, and the joint International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Pandemic Infl uenza with China, the European Commission, and the World Bank held in Beijing in 2006. [30] [31] [32] Subsequent management of infectious outbreaks such as avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus shows that China recognises the importance of strict adherence to the International Health Regulations. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, China needed 87 days between fi rst case detection and report to WHO and another 46 days for joint teams to investigate the outbreak. For H7N9 one decade later, less than half the days lapsed between fi rst case and report to WHO and the initiation of joint investigations. [33] [34] [35] Infections can move in several directions. China has been the destination of cross-border infectious transmissions. In 2011, a polio epidemic was imported from Pakistan into China's Xinjiang province. 36 after making arduous eff orts and expending large resources. 37 Similarly, China has been threatened by the import of dengue fever, malaria, and several other transmissible diseases. 38, 39 Cross-border risks can also accompany the import and export of commodities. As the world's largest exporter of manufactured products, China, of course, transfers health risk overseas. News reports have been plentiful of contamination in Chinese exports of toothpaste, lead paint, milk products, and heparin. [40] [41] [42] [43] These safety concerns are not limited to exporters. China has also been a destination in the dumping of contaminated chemicals from richer to poorer countries; 44 these safety hazards are of equal concern to the Chinese public. These concerns might be why China has upgraded its State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) to the status of a ministry with larger budget, increased staff , and stronger regulatory powers. 45 Environmental pollution also moves across national boundaries. Air pollutants in China have been cited as causing acid rain damage to forests in Korea and Japan. 46, 47 China is today the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, contributing substantially to global climate change. 48 To tackle air pollution, China's State Council released an action plan setting a 5-year road map for air pollution control. 49 Its implementation deserves tracking for monitoring and evaluation of control eff ect.",

By 2012-13, China's assessed contribution to WHO had increased to $30 million, while WHO funding to China had remained at baseline. 51 In parallel with this increase in funding, the number of Chinese staff members in WHO has expanded. Whereas in 1999, there were only 12 Chinese offi cials working in WHO, that number had tripled to 34 by 2012, although Chinese staff in WHO are still under-represented. 52 Additionally, based on the newly released white paper, China allocated $280 million to support the Global Fund and other international organisations in 2010-12. 8 Global health participation by China has been mainly governmental. In non-governmental stakeholders, growth in the international participation of some academic universities, business, and industry has occurred. China has very few non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and thus the Chinese are mostly absent from global civil society forums.

China's health aid volume is small, but the mode is distinctive, driven by China's health capabilities and national experiences. Unlike many other traditional donors, China's in-kind aid focuses more on some important aspects of the health system. China's overall global engagement follows a very diff erent path from developed countries partly because it has no colonial experience nor did it participate in shaping the American-led post-World War 2 world order. China was inward-looking until it expanded into the global economy in 1978. Over the ensuing three decades, China has had large shifts from a low-income to a middle-income country, and from aid recipient increasingly to aid donor. The spread of its foreign aid throughout the breadth of Africa presumably refl ects both eff orts to solidify friendship politically, promote mutually benefi cial economic gains, and compete with Taiwan for political friendship. 68 China's health aid is embedded in the dynamic shifting of foreign and economic policies. The opening in 1978 marked a shift from economic development serving foreign policy to foreign policy serving economic development because China's association, for example, with Africa, has developed from a political one in the 1970s to a broader economic-based and trade-based engagement. 69, 70 These are all defi ning characteristics of China's engagement in global health. China's global health work, unfortunately, does not seem to rank highly in government agencies. Health has been assigned a lower position than political and commercial aff airs. Taking advantage of both domestic and international resources and accessing both domestic and international markets is China's explicit national development strategy. 71 These powerful economic motives drive much of China's global engagement, including its engagement in Africa, to the point where the dividing line between trade and aid become blurred and hard to demarcate. 70 Health aid is only a very small adjunct to these much larger and more powerful forces.",

The records show that China respects and complies with rules governing multilateral institutions in all aff airs-health, trade, migration, environment, and other aspects of global governance. China has increased its contribution to multilateral funding pools, such as the Global Fund from $2 million per year in 2003, to $5 million per year in 2012. How important China will become as a major donor to these pooled funds is uncertain. Some see the early actions as symbolic gestures of cofunding, whereas others hope that the size of the Chinese economy will propel it to become a fi nancial leader of multilateral funds. The New Development Bank being established by BRICS countries aims to compete with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which is one example of how China has debatably played a leadership role. 72 Most important is the avoidance of over-simplifi cation. No country's international engagement is free from political or economic motives-eg, Europe colonialism, US millennium development accounts, or Sweden-Vietnam partnership during the American war. 73 And no single modality of foreign aid has proven to be more eff ective or more sustainable. 74,75 Although China's health aid is generally appreciated by recipient offi cial statements, there are indeed complaints about the scale of China's intrusion, access to natural resources, and the trade market in Africa. But energy resource-based trade structure with Africa does not occur only in China; it occurs with all major African trading partners.

The programme is establishing a China network on global health in universities and research institutes that started in 2014 with eight awards to Peking University, Fudan University, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, various units of the health ministry, and other Chinese units.59 This unusual grant has the overarching goal of encouraging Chinese institutions to partner with institutions from low-income and middle-income countries to work for better world health. global health were built in such universities as Peking, Fudan, Sun Yatsen, Central South (Xiangya), Wuhan, Kunming, and Peking Union Medical College.61 These universities are developing a Chinese curriculum in global health and pursuing research in Chinese health policy and systems. In these endeavours, Chinese collaboration with international universities has been growing. Joint programmes in global health have been launched with Duke University, Graduate Institute of Geneva, Georgetown University, Harvard, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Health, and University of Washington. The new Duke-Kunshan University, a partnership between Duke, Wuhan University, and the City of Kunshan near Shanghai, is featuring global health as one of its masters degree programmes aimed at both Chinese and overseas students.62 Panel 4 describes the formation of a China Consortium of Universities in Global Health, inspired by its counterpart in North America.",
