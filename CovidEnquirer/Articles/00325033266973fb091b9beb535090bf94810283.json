Secondary objectives were to assess if NIV use might increase mortality if intubation was subsequently required and if in some patients NIV could be predicted to be more successful.

Inclusion criteria were: adult viral pneumonia patients aged over 18 years, febrile (>38\u00b0C) acute illness; respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, myalgia or influenza-like illness; ARF (conventional oxygen therapy \u20210.5 to maintain SpO 2 \u202192%) requiring ICU admission; and microbiological confirmation of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1)v by real-time PCR. Data were reported by the attending physician reviewing medical charts and radiological and laboratory records within the first 12 h after ICU admission. Patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute pulmonary oedema, acute asthma and those already intubated at ICU admission or using NIV for palliative use or rescue therapy were excluded from the analysis [11] . The study was approved [11] by the institutional review board of Joan XXIII University Hospital, Tarragona (Spain). Patient identification remained anonymous and the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational nature of the study. The ICU admission criteria and treatment decisions for all patients, including determination of the need for intubation and type of antibiotic and antiviral therapy administered, were not standardized and were made by the attending physician.",

Moreover, in patients with NIV failure, delayed intubation because of a trial of non-invasive mechanical ventilation did not increase mortality. The use of NIV by clinicians in this large cohort of patients with severe acute respiratory infection is provocative, contrasting with the recommendations in many guidelines. Probably based on a previous study during the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic [20] , the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) [21] , the British Thoracic Society and WHO [22] include NIV as a high-risk procedure for disease transmission in ARF caused by influenza A (H1N1)v, although it has been shown that intubation is associated with a higher risk of viral particle transmission during severe acute respiratory syndrome [23] .

First, no data were provided on the severity of acute respiratory failure in the patients included in the study (for instance: respiratory rate, PaO 2 /FiO 2 , PaCO 2 , pH). It is different to use NIV at an early stage of respiratory failure (for instance when the PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio is <250) or a late stage of ARF in patients presenting with intubation criteria. The lack of these data does not allow comparison of this study with previous studies dealing with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Moreover, ICU admission and intubation criteria were not standardized. Delay time of intubation after NIV failure was not recorded. For the same reasons, NIV techniques and ventilation protocols are not reported. Again, comparison with previous studies is not possible. In addition, we cannot exclude that the lack of statistical difference in incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia between patients intubated from the beginning (19.2%) and those intubated after NIV failure (11.1%) is the result of a lack of power of the current sample size. In patients at risk of failure with NIV, methods used to optimize NIV are not reported. Another limitation is the self-reporting by sites, which introduces the risk of selection bias. Healthcare workers were not prospectively assessed with follow-up serologies and the safety of the procedure should be investigated. Although no official notification of nosocomially transmitted cases has been reported using this therapy, the technique must be applied using the security measures recommended by the CDC guidelines and many scientific societies. In spite of recommendations against its use and these limitations, clinicians used NIV in nearly half of this large multicentre cohort, and in a significant proportion it was successful, suggesting that patients with severe acute respiratory infection can take benefit from early non-invasive oxygenation techniques. A randomized clinical trial is warranted to determine which patients may benefit from these techniques, to improve prognosis and to help reduce healthcare costs.",

NIV failure was associated with a mortality similar to that in patients who were intubated from the start.",
