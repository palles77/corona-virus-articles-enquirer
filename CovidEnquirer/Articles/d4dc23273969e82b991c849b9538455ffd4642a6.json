While some studies demonstrate that approximately one-third to two-thirds of travelers returning from tropical countries experience some health problem, diarrhea is the most prevalent complaint. Mucocutaneous problems, however, are among the top five health complaints of the returned traveler, and comprise 10-15% of health concerns of persons returning from the tropics. 1 During international conflicts, soldiers from North America, Europe, and Australia are often required to serve in tropical lands and sometimes develop diseases not familiar to physicians of their home countries. This was the case for French soldiers serving in Vietnam in the 1950s and American soldiers serving there in the 1960s and 1970s. Recently hundreds of American and allied troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have developed \"Baghdad boils\" (i.e., leishmaniasis), transmitted by sand fly bites ( Fig. 1-1) .",

Whereas the cutaneous problems in the returned traveler are frequently the the person traveled. For frequent travelers, the history may become complex if patients report having visited many destinations within the past few months. Because vectors differ with the climate, the season of travel is also noteworthy. Even in a tropical country where the temperature is always hot or warm, there may be a dry season and a rainy season. Because seasons are reversed north and south of the Equator, it is important to know the season at the destination. The duration of the stay is significant, not only because a longer stay increases the chance of acquiring an infectious disease, but also because it tells the physician whether the person was in the tropics during the incubation period of the suspected disease. Whether the visitor was only in an urban environment or also in a rural area is relevant. Whereas a sexually transmitted disease (STD) could be acquired in either location, an arbovirus or a zoonosis might be more likely in a rural situation. The altitude of the destination could provide a clue to the etiology of the skin condition, as could the type of sleeping condition. For example, a sexually transmitted disease could easily be acquired in a five-star hotel, but an infection transmitted by a flea, louse, or mite would be more likely in someone who had slept on the ground and / or in a tent.",

For example, many antimalarials, such as chloroquine, mefloquine, proguanil, quinine, and halofantrine, can cause cutaneous reactions, and chloroquine, doxycycline, and quinine can cause photosensitivity. Interestingly, chloroquine can worsen psoriasis. A number of agents taken to treat or prevent diarrhea can also cause cutaneous reactions, such as quinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin), furazolidone, metronidazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and bismuth sulfate; quinolones are particularly likely to produce photosensitivity. Anthelmintic medications, such as On the other hand, contaminated food may have originated in a tropical or subtropical area, such as when oysters from the Gulf of Mexico are shipped to the Midwest USA and are consumed raw. The resulting Vibrio vulnificus or hepatitis A infection thus produces gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations in individuals who may not have visited the source of the shellfish. Therefore, it is always important to ask about new pets, changes in diet, or any other change in persons with a suspected tropical disease. On the other hand, travelers may have purchased non-consumable items that are the source of their dermatoses. For example, animal skins used for rugs or blankets may be the source of anthrax.

Because the incubation period of various infectious diseases differs widely, it is important to know when temperate countries, but in the 21st century they have become rare in industrialized countries, except for imported cases. Due to non-compliance with recommended vaccinations, however, 644 measles cases were reported in the US in 2014, the highest number in the 21st century. 3 A single outbreak in early 2015, resulting from an infected person visiting Disneyland, California, resulted in 125 cases. 4 Worldwide, however, almost one million children die of measles annually ( Fig. 1-5 ) and rubella still causes many congenital abnormalities. Measles is still the number one vaccine-preventable killer of children in the world. Morbidity and mortality are often the result of secondary bacterial infections developing in malnourished infants with measles ( Fig. 1-6 ). In east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and many other parts of the tropical world, hepatitis B is very common and a major source of morbidity and mortality. Although measles, rubella, and hepatitis B should not be a problem in the immunized traveler, many travelers have not received the proper immunizations because they or their parents had unfounded concerns about the safety of the vaccines. This problem continues to grow as more people reach child-bearing age without ivermectin, albendazole, and diethylcarbamazine, can also produce pruritus and rash. Even diethyltoluamide (DEET), used to prevent arthropod bites, can cause an irritant dermatitis when used in high concentrations.",

An animal bite or scratch should be easy to remember, but the bite of many arthropods may not even be noticed until after a cutaneous reaction has appeared and the fly, mite, or flea that is responsible has moved on to the next victim. Exposure to some animals may be more indirect. For example, the spelunker (cave explorer) may inhale aerosolized bat guano and develop rabies without ever touching a bat. A history of swimming, boating, or surfing can be a clue to an aquatic / marine etiology. Such fresh-or brackish-water activities may increase the risk of infection with schistosomiasis or with free-living ameba, whereas marine activities may be associated with jellyfish stings, contact with the venomous spines of certain fish, or irritant dermatitis from fire coral.

Three common examples are measles, rubella, and hepatitis B. Until the 1960s, measles and rubella were very common sources of infection in \u2022 If the traveler is strongly suspected of having an STD, did he / she visit a destination where chancroid, granuloma inguinale (GI), or lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) (L serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis) is prevalent? If so, the diagnostic tests and therapy might need to be expanded beyond those under consideration for STDs acquired in temperate lands. When one STD is confirmed, there is an increased possibility of acquisition of additional STDs. Not only is this the case because the source partner(s) may have had multiple STDs, but also because having certain STDs makes a person more susceptible to other STDs. The best example of this phenomenon is the two-to fivefold greater risk of acquiring HIV if the person with a genital ulcer disease (GUD) has sex with an HIV-positive individual. The reasons for this increased risk include the reduced epithelial barrier in all GUDs, as well as the infiltrate of CD4+ cells in certain GUDs such as genital herpes. These CD4+ cells are the targets for HIV infection. Genital herpes is the most prevalent GUD in industrialized countries. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that there are 45 million herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2)seropositive persons in the USA. In the tropics, chancroid has been the most frequently diagnosed GUD, followed by syphilis and genital herpes, but the last two diseases are becoming more prevalent in certain tropical countries. Depending on the travel destination, LGV and GI must also be considered. The dates and duration of travel are important components of the history because the primary clinical presentation of all these GUDs ranges between 2 and 3 days (genital herpes and chancroid) and 4 weeks (syphilis and GI).",

Because most true primary cases of genital herpes recur, a history of multiple recurrences of the vesicles or ulcers is highly consistent with genital herpes. This diagnosis can be confirmed by viral culture or serology. In the absence of these tools, a useful test is the Tzanck smear, which usually demonstrates multinucleated giant cells in herpetic lesions, but is of low sensitivity and specificity. Genital herpes, however, can present many diagnostic dilemmas because the first recognized clinical occurrence is often not the result of a recent infection but rather represents a first-episode, non-primary outbreak. Whereas a true primary outbreak of genital herpes is usually consistent with acquisition of the virus 2 days to 2 weeks previously, a first-episode, non-primary outbreak may be consistent with an infection at any time in the past.

A western blot or type-specific serologic test for HSV-2 would determine whether the person was infected with this virus, but it would not be definitive proof that that HSV-2 was responsible for the resolved outbreak. For example, a HSV-2 serologically positive person may acquire syphilis, but the genital ulcer may resolve without therapy, or with inadequate treatment, before the clinic visit at home. Thus, a careful history may reveal the need for serology for HSV-2 as well as for syphilis. Because HIV can be acquired concomitantly with or subsequently to these GUDs, but not produce genital manifestations, HIV testing should be conducted as well. Although many patients may be hesitant to admit sexual activity that puts them at risk for STDs, others will worry about these activities following travel (or any time) and ask to be tested for \"everything.\" If the sexual encounter with a new partner has been very recent, the serologic test may be false negative because serology for syphilis, HIV, or HSV-2 may require weeks to become positive in the majority of persons after initial infection.",

If syphilis is the cause of the GUD, it may reappear weeks or months later as non-genital cutaneous manifestations in the form of secondary (or tertiary) syphilis ( Fig. 1-7) . A careful history regarding the primary lesion may lead to the appropriate diagnostic tests and therapy. Some STDs may not produce any genital signs or symptoms and the disease may be diagnosed long after the travel (or the non-travel acquisition), making it more difficult to find the source of the infection. Although over 90% of HIV-seropositive persons eventually develop indirect mucocutaneous manifestations of infection, the primary rash of seroconversion (if present) is not noticed by most patients. Therefore, the diagnosis is usually made when the patient develops systemic signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, diarrhea, weight loss, lymphadenopathy) and / or develops one or more of the opportunistic infections, neoplasms, or inflammatory skin problems frequently seen in HIV patients. Similar to HIV, primary infection with hepatitis B rarely produces genital lesions. Diagnosis is usually made long after infection due to systemic symptoms or non-specific skin changes such as jaundice. Hepatitis B was the first STD for which a prophylactic vaccine was available. Therefore, a history of successful hepatitis B vaccination makes this diagnosis less likely. toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, tularemia, typhoid fever, and yellow fever.

Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer killer of women in the world and over 99% of all cervical cancer is caused by HPV. Most cervical cancer deaths are in tropical countries, making HPV one of the world's deadliest tropical diseases (although rarely listed with the other major tropical diseases). There are many reasons why more cervical cancer deaths occur in tropical countries. First, in industrialized countries most women receive regular Pap smears, which result in early detection and subsequent therapy of cervical abnormalities, thus reducing progression to cervical cancer. If cancer is detected, surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy is available. In addition HPV vaccines are now widely available in most industrialized countries. In most tropical countries, regular Pap smears are not the standard of care. Therefore, cervical cancer is often detected too late for successful intervention, even if this is available. Second, there appears to be a genetic susceptibility that allows oncogenic HPV to progress to malignancy. This genetic susceptibility appears to be more prevalent in certain tropical countries. The rarity of male circumcision in many tropical countries appears to be a risk factor for the development of cervical cancer in these males' partners. Third, most of the world's estimated 46 million HIV-seropositive individuals live in tropical countries where no antiretroviral therapy is available. Not only is cervical cancer an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness in HIV-seropositive women, but the same HPV can also cause anal cancer, which is a major problem in homosexual men with HIV.",

Bacterial causes of nodules include Bartonella (verruga peruana and cat-scratch disease), Buckholderia mallei (glanders), Calymmatobacterium granulomatis (GI), Chlamydia trachomatis (LGV), Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis (rhinoscleroma), Leptospira autumnalis (leptospirosis), Mycobacteria spp. (atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous tuberculosis, leprosy, etc.), Nocardia brasiliensis (and other bacterial causes of mycetoma), and Treponema pallidum (bejel, yaws). Protozoan causes of nodules include amebiasis, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis. Almost all helminthic infections that have mucocutaneous manifestations can induce nodules (e.g., coenurosis, cysticercosis, dirofilariasis, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, filariasis, gnathostomiasis, loiasis, onchocerciasis, paragonimiasis, schistosomiasis, sparganosis, and visceral larval migrans). If the helminthic nodule contains sufficient fluid, it will produce a cyst. Cysts can be seen in helminthic infections such as coenurosis, echinococcosis, filariasis, gnathostomiasis, loiasis, and onchocerciasis. There are also arthropod causes of nodules such as myiasis, scabies, tick granulomas, and tungiasis.",

            "text": "Although ulcers can form as a result of breakdown of previously normal skin, they frequently develop from nodules after inflammation destroys the epidermis and papillary layer of the dermis. Herpes simplex virus is a very common cause of ulcers in both tropical and temperate regions of the world. Other causes of GUD are bacterial (e.g., chancroid, GI, LGV, and primary syphilis). Other bacterial diseases that commonly cause ulcers include anthrax, bacterial mycetomas, diphtheria, glanders, melioidosis, mycobacterial diseases (e.g., Buruli ulcer, leprosy, tuberculosis), plague, rickettsia, tropical ulcers, tularemia, and yaws. A number of fungi can form nodules that break down into ulcers, or they can induce ulcers from systemic spread (e.g., blastomycosis, chromomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, lobomycosis, mycetomas, paracoccidioidomycosis, penicilliosis, and sporotrichosis). The most common helminthic cause of cutaneous ulcers is dracunculiasis, when the worm erupts from the skin. Two protozoan diseases cause ulcers -amebiasis and leishmaniasis. Arthropod causes of ulcers include myiasis and tungiasis. Many bites (e.g., those of brown recluse spiders and various snakes), stings (e.g., insect, jellyfish, and scorpion), or venomous spines of various fish can also induce ulcers.",

These imported cases, and the fact that the vector is the same as for dengue and Chikungunya, may result in local spread of the virus in some areas of the USA. 21, [24] [25] [26] American trypanosomiais, also known as Chagas disease (CD), is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is transmitted to humans by triatomine insects (blood-sucking bugs of the Reduviidae family). These insects deposit their feces, which are laden with T. cruzi, at the time of biting. However, CD can also be transmitted via mother-to-child transmission, 27 food-borne transmission, and blood transfusion. For this reason, screening of the US blood supply for CD began in early 2007. CD infects Ebola is a hemorrhagic fever disease caused by Ebola virus, a member of the Filoviridae family. Ebola was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in Congo. Since then, outbreaks have appeared sporadically in Central Africa. The largest epidemic in history occurred in 2014, affecting multiple countries in West Africa. 14 Five different Ebola viruses are known, with Zaire Ebola virus being the most virulent and causative agent in the most recent epidemic. 15 With a fatality rate of up to 90%, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Ebola a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' . 16 In the United States (USA) two imported cases, including one death, and two locally acquired cases in health-care workers were reported. Ebola can be transmitted via direct contact with body fluids. Dermatologists should be cautious of the high risk of contamination through skin biopsies and dermatologic examination.",
