More countries are therefore becoming interested in fractionation programs that make use of such wasted plasma to improve access to plasma-derived products of assured quality. One major issue is that currently collected plasma in low-and medium-income countries typically does not meet specifications for fractionation and is therefore discarded.

In such a situation, plasma is sent to a licensed fractionator, and final products are returned to the plasma supplier for use in the country after licensing.

            "text": "There are concerns that viruses belonging to the Filoviridae family, particularly the Ebola virus, may enter the blood supply and affect the quality and safety of industrial plasma products. The traditional tripod of safety of blood and plasma products for well-known blood-borne viruses [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and C virus (HCV)] is, in addition to a well-structured blood collection organization [26] , selection of donors, testing of blood donations, and viral-reduction treatments implemented during plasma product manufacture [27] . In early phases of a new infection, selection of donors and testing of donations might not be effective or applicable if infective donors are asymptomatic or a test is unavailable. In such situations, viral safety relies solely on the robustness of viralreduction steps already in place in the manufacturing process of plasma products. Over the years and following the identification of the transmission of HIV, HBV, and HCV enveloped viruses, and then non-enveloped parvovirus B19 and HAV viruses by plasma products, substantial progress has been made by the plasma fractionation industry, under close supervision of the main regulatory authorities, to develop, validate, and implement effective viral-inactivation treatments. For instance, a technology like solvent-detergent has been able to eliminate risks from lipid-enveloped viruses, including agents like WNV, DENV, SARS, avian influenza virus, and chikungunya when they entered the plasma supply and before the introduction of test procedures, if any, for viral markers [28] [29] [30] . It is expected that the robustness evidenced by this technology, and possibly other technologies against enveloped viruses like caprylic acid treatment, can safeguard plasma products from the risk of all lipid-enveloped infectious agents, including filoviruses. To address the risks associated with non-enveloped (in addition to enveloped) viruses, a technology like nanofiltration provides generic and controlled removal of infectious agents based on a size-exclusion mechanism [31] , while pasteurization has also demonstrated robustness against a large range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [27] . Under the current state of viralreduction technology implemented by plasma fractionators and multi-step purification procedures responsible for removing viruses, it seems scientifically reasonable to conclude that potential residual infectious risks for most plasma products would be restricted to emerging resistant small (<15~20 nm) non-enveloped viruses.",

Strong government support to enhance the quality of blood collection organizations is therefore required. Plasma meeting regulatory requirements for fractionation can be processed through contract agreements into various derivatives. Some countries have found such organizations to be cost-effective and useful to ensure access to products, while a few others are building or considering domestic facilities.
