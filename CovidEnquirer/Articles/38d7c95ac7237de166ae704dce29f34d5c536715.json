Because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites only able to replicate inside the appropriate host cells, the genome must contain information encoded in a way that can be recognized and decoded by the particular type of host cell. The genetic code used by the virus must match or at least be recognized by the host organism. Similarly, the control signals that direct the expression of virus genes must be appropriate to the host. Many of the DNA viruses of eukaryotes closely resemble their host cells in terms of the biology of their genomes. Chapter 4 describes the ways in which virus genomes are replicated, and Chapter 5 deals in more detail with the mechanisms that regulate the expression of virus genetic information. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the diversity of virus genomes and to consider how and why this variation may have arisen.",

            "text": "n Split genes containing noncoding introns, protein-coding exons, and spliced mRNAs were first discovered in adenoviruses by Roberts and Sharp in 1977. Introns in prokaryotes were first discovered in the genome of bacteriophage T4 in 1984 . Several examples of this phenomenon have now been discovered in T4 and some other phages. This raises an important point. The conventional view is that prokaryote genomes are smaller and replicate faster than those of eukaryotes and hence can be regarded as streamlined. The genome of phage T4 consists of 160 kbp of double-stranded DNA and is highly compressed; for example, promoters and translation control sequences are nested within the coding regions of overlapping upstream genes. The presence of introns in bacteriophage genomes, which are under constant ruthless pressure to exclude junk sequences, suggests that these genetic elements must have evolved mechanisms to escape or neutralize this pressure and to persist as parasites within parasites. All virus genomes experience pressure to minimize their size. Viruses with prokaryotic hosts must be able to replicate sufficiently quickly to keep up with their host cells, and this is reflected in the compact nature of many (but not all) bacteriophages. Overlapping genes are common, and the maximum genetic capacity is compressed into the minimum genome size. In viruses with eukaryotic hosts there is also pressure on genome size. Here, however, the pressure is mainly from the packaging size of the virus particle (i.e., the amount of nucleic acid that can be incorporated into the virion). Therefore, these viruses commonly show highly compressed genetic information when compared with the low density of information in eukaryotic cellular genomes.",

Among viruses of eukaryotes, herpesviruses and poxviruses also have relatively large genomes, up to 235 kbp. It is notable that these virus genomes contain many genes involved in their own replication, particularly enzymes concerned with nucleic acid metabolism. These viruses partially escape the restrictions imposed by the biochemistry of the host cell by encoding additional biochemical equipment.

So does having a bigger genome make a better virus? Not in my opinion. As discussed in this chapter, some virus genomes are as complex as bacterial genomes, and larger than some of the smaller ones. This means they have nearly the same capabilities as bacteria, but not quite. No virus genome contains all the genes needed to make ribosomes, so in the end they are still parasites.

Perhaps the most important single technique has been gel electrophoresis (Figure 3 .1). The earliest gel matrix employed for separating molecules was based on starch and gave relatively poor resolution. It is now most common to use agarose gels to separate large nucleic acid molecules, which may be very large indeeddseveral megabases (million base pairs) in the case of techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to separate smaller pieces (down to sizes of a few nucleotides).

The net negative charge due to the phosphate groups in the backbone of nucleic acid molecules results in their movement away from the cathode and toward the anode. Smaller molecules are able to slip through the gel matrix more easily and thus migrate farther than larger molecules, which are retarded, resulting in a net separation based on the size of the molecules. value in analyzing intact virus genomes, particularly the analysis of viruses with segmented genomes (see later discussion). The most recent and most powerful sequence analysis techniques such as pyrosequencing have done away with electrophoresis and rely on light detection from fluorescent compounds. Phenotypic analysis of virus populations has long been a standard technique of virology. In modern terms, this might be considered functional genomics. Examination of variant viruses and naturally occurring spontaneous mutants is an old method for determining the function of virus genes. Molecular biology has added to this the ability to design and create specific mutations, deletions, and recombinants in vitro. This site-directed mutagenesis is a very powerful tool. Although genetic coding capacity can be examined in vitro by the use of cell-free extracts to translate mRNAs, complete functional analysis of virus genomes can be performed only on intact viruses.

In this case, direct introduction of RNA into cells circumvents the earliest stages of the replicative cycle (Chapter 4). Virus genomes that are composed of double-stranded DNA are also infectious. The events that occur here are a little more complex, because the virus genome must first be transcribed by host polymerases to produce mRNA. This is relatively simple for phage genomes introduced into prokaryotes, but for viruses that replicate in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, such as herpesviruses, the DNA must first find its way to the appropriate cellular compartment. Most of the DNA that is introduced into cells by transfection is degraded by cellular nucleases. However, irrespective of its sequence, a small proportion of the newly introduced DNA finds its way into the nucleus, where it is transcribed by cellular polymerases.",

These differences are due to the mechanism of genome replication, with error rates in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases generally being higher than in DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Some RNA virus polymerases do have proofreading functions, but in general mutation rates are higher in most RNA viruses than in DNA viruses. For a virus, mutations are a mixed blessing. The ability to generate antigenic variants that can escape the immune response is a clear advantage, but mutation also results in many defective particles, since most mutations are deleterious. In the most extreme cases (e.g., HIV), the error rate is 10 \u00c03 to 10 \u00c04 per nucleotide incorporated. The HIV genome is approximately 9.7 kb long; therefore, there will be 0.9 to 9.7 mutations in every genome copied. Hence, in this case, the wild-type virus actually consists of a fleeting majority type that dominates the dynamic equilibrium (i.e., the population of genomes) present in all cultures of the virus.

The phenotype of these mutations can be suppressed by propagation of a virus in a cell (bacterial or, more recently, animal) with altered suppressor tRNAs. Nonsense mutations are rarely leaky (i.e., the normal function of the protein is completely obliterated) and can only revert to wild-type at the original site (see later), so they usually have a low reversion frequency. n Plaque morphology: Mutants may be either large-plaque mutants, which replicate more rapidly than the wild-type, or small-plaque mutants, which are the opposite. Plaque size is often related to a temperature-sensitive (t.s.) phenotype (see next). These mutants are often useful as unselected markers in multifactorial crosses. n Temperature-sensitive (t.s.): This type of mutation is very useful because it allows the isolation of conditional-lethal mutations, a powerful means of examining virus genes that are essential for replication and whose function cannot otherwise be interrupted. Temperature-sensitive mutations usually result from missense mutations in proteins (i.e., amino acid substitutions), resulting in proteins of full size with subtly altered conformation that can function at (permissive) low temperatures but not at (nonpermissive) higher ones. Generally, the mutant proteins are immunologically unaltered, which is frequently useful. These mutations are usually leakydthat is, some of the normal activity is retained even at nonpermissive temperatures. Protein function is often impaired, even at permissive temperatures, therefore a high frequency of reversion is often a problem with this type of mutation because the wild-type virus replicates faster than the mutant. n Cold-sensitive (c.s.): These mutants are the opposite of t.s. mutants and are very useful in bacteriophages and plant viruses whose host cells can be propagated at low temperatures but are less useful for animal viruses because their host cells generally will not grow at significantly lower temperatures than normal. n Revertants: Reverse mutation is a valid type of mutation in its own right. Most of the previous classes can undergo reverse mutation, which may be either simple back mutations (i.e., correction of the original mutation) or second-site compensatory mutations, which may be physically distant from the original mutation and not even necessarily in the same gene as the original mutation.",

Among viruses, only retroviruses are truly diploid, with two complete copies of the entire genome, but some DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, have repeated sequences and are therefore partially heterozygous.

Subsequent generations of viruses inherit and display the original parental phenotypes. This process can occur easily in viruses with naked capsids (nonenveloped) that are closely related (e.g., different strains of enteroviruses) or in enveloped viruses, which need not be related to one another (Figure 3 .4).

The problem of strand breakage is particularly relevant for single-stranded RNA, which is less chemically stable than double-stranded DNA. The longest single-stranded RNA genomes are those of the coronaviruses at approximately 30 kb, but the longest double-stranded DNA virus genomes are considerably longer (e.g., Mimivirus at up to 1.2 Mbp). Physical breakage of the genome results in biological inactivation, since it cannot be completely transcribed, translated, or replicated. Segmentation means that the virus avoids \"having all its eggs in one basket\" and also reduces the probability of breakages due to shearing, thus increasing the total potential coding capacity of the entire genome. However, the disadvantage of this strategy is that all the individual genome segments must be packaged into each virus particle or the virus will be defective as a result of loss of genetic information.

Clearly, there is some interaction between the genome segments and it is this that explains the ability of influenza virus particles to select and package the genome segments within each particle with a surprisingly low error rate, considering the difficulty of the task (Chapter 2).",

Geminiviruses are divided into three genera based on their host plants (monocotyledons or dicotyledons) and insect vectors (leafhoppers or whiteflies). In the Mastrevirus and Curtovirus genera, the genome consists of a single-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 2.7 kb. The DNA packaged into these virions has been arbitrarily designated as positive-sense, although both the positive-sense and negative-sense strands found in infected cells contain protein-coding sequences. The genome of geminiviruses in the genus Begmovirus is bipartite and consists of two circular, single-stranded DNA molecules, each of which is packaged into a separate particle (Figure 3.16) . Both of the strands comprising the genome are approximately 2.7 kb long and differ from one another completely in nucleotide sequence, except for a shared 200-nt noncoding sequence involved in DNA replication. The two genomic DNAs are packaged into entirely separate capsids. Because a productive infection requires both parts of the genome, it is necessary for a minimum of two virus particles bearing one copy of each of the genome segments to infect a new host cell. Although geminiviruses do not multiply in the tissues of their insect vectors (nonpropagative transmission), a sufficiently large amount of virus is ingested and subsequently deposited onto a new host plant to favor such superinfections.",

Integrated phage genomes are known as prophage, and integration is essential for the establishment of lysogeny. At intervals in bacterial cells lysogenic for Mu, the prophage undergoes transposition to a different site in the host genome. The mechanism leading to transposition is different from that responsible for the initial integration of the phage genome (which is conservative in that it does not involve replication) and is a complex process requiring numerous phage-encoded and host-cell proteins. Transposition is tightly linked to replication of the phage genome and results in the formation of a co-integratedthat is, a duplicate copy of the phage genome flanking a target sequence in which insertion has occurred. The original Mu genome remains in the same location where it first integrated and is joined by a second integrated genome at another site. (Not all prokaryotic transposons use this process; some, such as TN10, are not replicated during transposition but are excised from the original integration site and integrate elsewhere.) There are two consequences of such a transposition. First, the phage genome is replicated during this process (advantageous for the virus), and second, the sequences flanked by the two phage genomes (which form repeated sequences) are at risk of secondary rearrangements, including deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations (possibly but not necessarily deleterious for the host cell).",

The 5.6-kb RNA transcript can be incorporated into such particles, resulting in the formation of intracellular structures known as Ty-VLPs.

Three forms of double-stranded DNA are found in retrovirusinfected cells following reverse transcription: linear DNA and two circular forms that contain either one or two LTRs. From the structure at the ends of the provirus, it was previously believed that the two-LTR circle was the form used for integration. In recent years, systems that have been developed to study the integration of retrovirus DNA in vitro show that it is the linear form that integrates. This discrepancy can be resolved by a model in which the ends of the two LTRs are held in close proximity by the reverse transcriptaseeintegrase complex. The net result of integration is that 1 to 2 bp are lost from the end of each LTR and 4 to 6 bp of cellular DNA are duplicated on either side of the provirus. It is unclear whether there is any specificity regarding the site of integration into the cell genome.

While each of these theories has its devotees and this subject provokes fierce disagreements, the fact is that viruses exist, and we are all infected with them. The practical importance of the origin of viruses is that this issue may have implications for virology here and now. Genetic and nucleotide sequence relationships between viruses can reveal the origins not only of individual viruses, but also of whole families and possible superfamilies. In a number of groups of viruses previously thought to be unrelated, genome sequencing has revealed that functional regions appear to be grouped together in a similar way. The extent to which there is any sequence similarity between these regions in different viruses varies, although clearly the active sites of enzymes such as virus replicases are strongly conserved. The emphasis in these groups is more on functional and organizational similarities. The original classification scheme for viruses did not recognize a higher level grouping than the family (see Appendix 2 ), but there are now six groups of related virus families equivalent to the orders of formal biological nomenclature (Table 3 .4).",

Although it is tempting to speculate on events that may have occurred before the origins of life as it is presently recognized, it would be unwise to discount the pressures that might result in viruses with diverse origins assuming common genetic solutions to common problems of storing, replicating, and expressing genetic information. This is particularly true now that we appreciate the plasticity of virus and cellular genomes and the mobility of genetic information from virus to virus, cell to virus, and virus to cell. There is no reason to believe that virus evolution has stopped, and it is dangerous to do so.

This made it difficult to see how they were related to each other. Eventually it was agreed that some viruses were sufficiently similar to allow them to be grouped together as a genusdin the same way that horses (Equus caballus) are in the same genus as donkeys (Equus asinus). The next step was to group similar genera (plural of genus) together as families. At that point, there was a pause for some years until it was agreed that similar virus families could be grouped into orders, of which six have now been recognized. This change happened after enough nucleotide sequence data had been accumulated to make the faint evolutionary relationships between distantly related viruses apparent. Why does it matter? In part because this is a window on the past allowing us to look back millions of years through these genetic fossils, but much more importantly because it points to what viruses are capable of and where they might be going in the future.

The genomes of adenoviruses consist of linear, double-stranded DNA of 30 to 38 kbp, the precise size of which varies between different adenoviruses. These genomes contain 30 to 40 genes(Figure 3.9). The terminal sequence of each DNA strand is an inverted repeat of 100 to 140 bp, and the denatured single strands can form panhandle structures. These structures are important in DNA replication, as is a 55-kDa protein known as the terminal protein that is covalently attached to the 5 0 end of each strand.
