Resulting from mutations affecting C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), inhibitor of the first complement system component, attacks are not histamine-mediated and do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids. Low awareness and resemblance to other disorders often delay diagnosis; despite availability of C1-INH replacement in some countries, no approved, safe acute attack therapy exists in the United States. The biennial C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops resulted from a European initiative for better knowledge and treatment of HAE and related diseases. This supplement contains work presented at the third workshop and expanded content toward a definitive picture of angioedema in the absence of allergy. Most notably, it includes cumulative genetic investigations; multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations; current pathogenesis hypotheses; suggested prophylaxis and acute attack treatment, including home treatment; future treatment options; and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are also discussed. Collaborative patient and physician efforts, crucial in rare diseases, are emphasized. This supplement seeks to raise awareness and aid diagnosis of HAE, optimize treatment for all patients, and provide a platform for further research in this rare, partially understood disorder.

In many ways, the field of nonallergic angioedema, and especially HAE, is becoming an exemplar for the understanding and management of rare diseases. The estimated frequency of HAE is 1:50,000. 7 As in many uncommon conditions, HAE's infrequent incidence fosters collaboration, forcing clinicians and researchers to pool their anecdotal experiences and data to attain statistical significance. Nonetheless, HAE is an attractive field because it offers doctors a chance to improve the lives of their patients dramatically through study but also via educated case management. As such, it has brought together a group of motivated and compassionate physicians. The pharmaceutical industry has also been welcomed to the C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshop and other HAE initiatives, fostering free exchanges between academia, industry, and patients.",

The first C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshop, held in Hungary in 1999, was the earliest meeting to follow this model. Since then, the 2 subsequent workshops and other patient-association gatherings in the United States and Canada have followed its inclusive precedent. Such a high level of patient involvement reflects not only the close relationship between knowledgeable physicians and their patients but also regional shortcomings in diagnosis and treatment. Because of the incapacitating and life-threatening aspects of the disease, patients and their families from areas where HAE is largely unknown have been forced to become educated enough to explain the disorder to strangers and, often, emergency department personnel to obtain the proper treatment. Even patients whose cases are managed by a competent local practitioner may have attacks while traveling or when their doctor is unavailable and thus may need to articulate their condition to someone entirely unfamiliar with the disease. By incontrovertible necessity, patients with HAE are one of the best-educated patient populations, and this is especially true in areas where satisfactory therapy for acute attacks is unavailable.",

For patients with HAE, it can help to reduce the isolation of having a rare disease. Many patients first contact their national patient association online and use email to stay in touch with fellow patients. The Internet is also being used by physicians and scientists to support a private patient registry and a public, constantly updated human C1-INH gene (C1NH) mutation database. Through this online contact and regular meetings open to all, information about nonallergic angioedema is shared rapidly among a small, concerned group. Nonetheless, the need to educate more physicians and the general public remains. The rarity of nonallergic angioedema increases the likelihood that clinicians, especially general practitioners or emergency department personnel, may never have seen a case. Patient organizations and other groups have thus worked to create emergency passports for patients with known HAE to carry and educational materials to distribute to emergency departments.",

However, several central pieces are missing. Despite recognition of functional C1-INH deficiency as the cause of most forms of nonallergic angioedema, the specific mechanism of attack generation has not been definitively described. Likewise, symptoms similar to those of nonallergic angioedema have now been reported in patients with normal amounts of functional C1-INH. 8 Multiple pathways have been proposed for the chemical cause of angioedema attacks. The murine HAE model developed by Han et al 9 shares similarities with the human form of the disease but diverges from typical HAE in the triggering of angioedema. Despite homozygous C1-INH deficiency, the mice, with few exceptions, have not been observed to have typical angioedema attacks. Attacks, manifesting solely as local increases in vascular permeability, could be provoked by the application of mustard oil. Rather than representing a shortcoming of the mouse model, such a high threshold for attacks might parallel the course of those human heterozygotes, identified via a family member with active HAE, who nonetheless never have an attack (for documentation of such patients, see Agostoni and Cicardi 7 ). The absence of spontaneous attacks despite profound C1-INH deficiency suggests that multiple biological events must transpire for angioedema to manifest.",

[13] [14] [15] [16] Nonetheless, within the current understanding of coagulation, kinin, and complement pathways, neither peptide seems to perfectly explain all of the symptoms of angioedema.

It is proposed that the activation of factor XII is crucial to attack generation, 17 and that factor XII activation may be a result of phospholipids released from damaged or apoptotic cells. Recently, endothelial cells have been implicated in the generation, via kallikrein, of bradykinin, both in the presence 18 and absence 19, 20 of factor XII. These hypotheses explain how illness or localized tissue damage may precipitate attacks but do not account for other triggers, which are themselves not well defined. In large part, triggers seem to vary from patient to patient and, in several attacks, may not be apparent. Of these, the most scientifically documented and explored are hormonal triggers, made all the more interesting by relatively recent reports of patients with normal C1-INH concentrations and HAE-like symptoms provoked or exacerbated by increased levels of estrogen.",

Depending on the patient and trimester, pregnancy may reduce or increase the number and severity of attacks. 23, 24 In this supplement, the role of progesterone is debated, with Visy et al finding a positive correlation between serum progesterone values and attack frequency, whereas Bork et al note no increase in attack frequency among patients whose oral contraceptive (OC) contained progesterone and estrogen compared with those receiving estrogen alone. Indeed, Bork et al refer to several published works in which progestins were used, with varying success, to ameliorate HAE symptoms. 22a-24a In contrast, danazol, a common prophylaxis, alters multiple biological mechanisms but is known to block progesterone receptors and increase progesterone's metabolic clearance. 25 Given these conflicting findings, the influence of progesterone seems a likely area for further study.",

            "text": "In the first part of this section, Cicardi and Zingale describe the varied ways in which HAE can manifest and discuss other diseases that published case reports and their clinical case series have associated with HAE. The symptoms of HAE are caused by the extravasation of plasma into the deeper cutaneous or mucosal layers as a result of 1 or more locally released vasoactive peptides. The edema in HAE is nonwhealing, nonpruritic, and generally unrelieved by antihistamines, suggesting that histamine is not involved in its induction. 26 The biological characteristics of the vasoactive peptides released in C1-INH-deficient sera indicate that the peptides belong to the kinin family. However, the discussion is not entirely closed on whether bradykinin, released because of contact system activation, or a peptide originated from C2 on classical complement pathway activation and the generation of plasmin, is the main mediator of symptoms in patients with HAE. 11, 12 Nonetheless, recent lines of evidence coming from C1-INH knockout mice, studies in patients' plasma, and analysis of C1-INH mutants from patients with HAE support the bradykinin hypothesis. 9, 27, 28 Kinin peptides participate in inflammatory processes and increase vascular permeability, activating intracellular pathways that lead to the release of nitric oxide. 29, 30 Vascular leakage can occur without anatomical damage and rapidly revert when the release of mediator molecules ceases. Hence, edema usually resolves within 72 hours. In some cases, it may resolve within 12 hours, but in others, it may persist as long as 5 days. Urticaria, a condition analogous to angioedema but with plasma leakage into the upper cutaneous layers, is typically absent or minimal and short-lasting in patients with HAE.",

Recurrent abdominal pain, a consequence of gastrointestinal wall edema, is reported by 70% to 80% of patients with HAE. 7, 31, 32 This is a distinguishing feature of C1-INH deficiency because abdominal involvement is rarely seen in angioedema of other origins. It presents with symptoms that may vary from mild discomfort to severe, intractable pain accompanied by vomiting and/or diarrhea. 33 In this setting, hypovolemia can result from a combination of fluid loss, plasma extravasation, and vasodilation and can progress to hypovolemic shock. 34, 35 Ascites resulting from extravasation into the peritoneal cavity, edema of the bowel wall, or changes in splenoportal axis caliber have been described during abdominal attacks as detected by ultrasounds or computed tomography. [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Gastrointestinal endoscopy performed during an abdominal attack revealed gastric involvement. Interestingly, during the healing process after a prominent gastric edema, several small nodules and raised erosions developed over the entire gastric mucosal surface. Within 55 days, the gastric mucosa had returned to normal. 42 The similarity between bowel angioedema and surgical emergencies is confirmed by the fact that approximately E of patients with undiagnosed HAE undergo unnecessary surgery during abdominal attacks. 7 However, even after a diagnosis of HAE has been established, differentiating angioedema of the bowel from a surgical emergency remains a critical task for the physician. 31 The physical examination can show the presence of an abdominal defense reaction. Moderate or sometimes even marked leukocytosis can be part of an angioedema attack. 43 Abdominal ultrasounds and computer-assisted tomogra-phy scans demonstrate the presence of free peritoneal fluid and edematous intestinal mucosa. 36, 39, 41 However, all of these signs are clearly not specific to angioedema. The authors note that this symptomatic generality should be borne in mind to avoid the situation that occurred with a patient in their case series. Surgery was inappropriately delayed when acute appendicitis was mistaken for intestinal angioedema. The efficacy of C1-INH plasma concentrate in resolving symptoms may help to distinguish angioedema from a true surgical emergency.",

They suggest that the high efficiency of the pulmonary vascular tree in the inactivation of bradykinin accounts for the lungs' protection from its effects. 52 Age of onset and frequency of symptoms. C1-INH deficiency is present at birth, and a minority can have perinatal angioedema symptoms. Most commonly, symptoms begin at school age. Half of patients with HAE had symptoms within the first decade of life, and another third had symptoms by the second decade. Asymptomatic adults carrying a C1NH mutation, detected because of the presence of offspring with clinically overt disease, have been described and are estimated to account for 5% of all patients with HAE. 7 The frequency at which bouts of angioedema recur is extremely variable among subjects and may vary in the same individual during different stages of life. A survey of the Italian case list showed that slightly less than E of untreated patients with HAE have more than 1 angioedema attack per month, 40% have 6 to 11 swellings per year, and the remaining 30% are infrequently symptomatic or completely symptom-free. This range of phenotypic expression has no significant correlation with plasma concentrations of C1-INH and is usually inconsistent among family groups. It should therefore be concluded that factors other than C1-INH deficiency intervene to determine a subject's tendency to develop angioedema. These factors might be genetic or environmental. The hypothesis that symptom frequency correlates with specific functional polymorphisms of some of the proteins involved in pathogenesis is attractive but thus far unproven. An initial report suggesting that a polymorphism within the bradykinin receptor could distinguish oligosymptomatic from polysymptomatic patients has not been confirmed. 53 Farkas et al 54 found that patients with HAE infected with Helicobacter pylori are more susceptible to symptoms than uninfected patients, and that eradication of the infection reduces the frequency and severity of swellings, particularly angioedema of the bowel. If confirmed in a larger group of patients, these findings could support those of several groups suggesting that infections increase susceptibility to angioedema in the general population as well as in patients with HAE. 7, 31, [55] [56] [57] Clinical and laboratory criteria for diagnosis are provided in Table I ; a severity scale for the evaluation of nonallergic angioedema is provided in Table II . These tools are based on contributions elaborated from experts from 10 European countries who received a grant from the European Commission for a project called Novel Methods for Predicting, Preventing, and Treating Attacks in Patients with Hereditary Angioedema (PREHAEAT), consisting of a concerted action in the framework of the specific research and a technologic development program, Quality of Life and Management of Living Resources, designed to improve the lives of patients with HAE.",

In undiagnosed patients, ultrasound examination can be a differential diagnostic means for recognizing HAE in the abdominal organs because of its ability to detect nonspecific but sensitive clues such as thickening of the intestinal wall, free peritoneal fluid, intestinal hypermotility or hypomotility, and echo pattern FIG 7 . Sagittal and transverse sonograms during an HAE attack before and after treatment. Sagittal sections are shown above, transverse below. A, A large amount of free peritoneal fluid has accumulated in the pouch of Douglas and, in the sagittal section, a floating intestinal loop is visible. The urinary bladder appears below. B, Soon after treatment with C1-INH concentrate, the amount of peritoneal fluid is somewhat decreased. C, Only a minimal amount of fluid is present in the pouch of Douglas 24 hours after C1-INH treatment.

Ultrasound examination has therefore proven very useful as a complementary, quick, and painless tool for recognizing the early phase symptoms of HAE. Patients presenting with skin symptoms (erythema marginatum) or acute pains, nausea, vomiting, or profuse diarrhea of unknown origins should be immediately hospitalized and investigated with ultrasound. Ultrasound follow-up in known cases of HAE is also capable of proving the efficacy and expeditiousness of acute attack treatment. In rare cases in which patients with known HAE present with abdominal symptoms unresponsive to C1-INH concentrate, ultrasonography may help distinguish between a refractory HAE attack and an unrelated surgical emergency.",

Its variants include types I (HAE-I) and II (HAE-II), associated with mutations of the C1 inhibitor gene (C1NH or SERPING1), 84,85 and a newly described type not associated with C1-INH deficiency 8,86,87 further defined and discussed in another section.",

According to the relative concentrations of antigenic and functional C1-INH, 2 types of HAE have traditionally been described. 88 The defective gene produces either no C1-INH (HAE-I) or a dysfunctional C1-INH (HAE-II). 6, 84, 85, 88 In either case, it is associated with low functional activity of C1-INH, low levels of C4, and normal levels of the third component of the complement In HAE-I (;85% of patients with C1-INH-associated  HAE), defective expression of 1 allele results in low  antigenic and functional concentrations of C1-INH.  In HAE-II (;15% of patients with C1-INH-associated  HAE) , concentrations of functional C1-INH are low, but C1-INH antigenic levels are normal or increased, with the presence of a dysfunctional mutant protein. 88 For both, C1-INH function is usually 5% to 30% of normal, instead of the 50% expected if the single normal allele were fully expressed. This difference is ascribed to permanent C1 and contact phase activation, with subsequent C1-INH consumption in the periphery. 89, 90 Interestingly, the description of low levels of nonfunctional C1-INH mutants in patients with HAE-I has demonstrated that the distinction between HAE-I and HAE-II is not absolute. 91 This finding occurred in patients with mutations to exon 8 at the carboxy terminus of the C1NH gene, thought to be responsible for the proper folding necessary for transport outside of the cell and exposure of the reactive site loop. Thus, although these patients with low antigenic concentrations of C1-INH appear to have HAE-I, they are in fact expressing nonfunctional C1-INH that cannot efficiently exit the cell.",

[93] [94] [95] With ACE inhibitor administration, APP becomes the primary enzyme responsible for inactivating bradykinin and des-Arg-bradykinin. In fact, individuals with low plasma concentrations of APP appear to be predisposed to developing angioedema during ACE inhibitor treatment, when neither ACE nor APP is available to inactivate these kinins. 96 Kinin inactivation pathways might also modulate clinical symptoms in classic HAE. For example, decreasing kinin inactivation in patients with HAE with the use of ACE inhibitors can result in exacerbation of angioedema.

Age of onset of symptoms in the patients of Bork et al 86 was variable and was not reported as directly correlating with onset of exogenous estrogen use or pregnancy. Symptoms in at least 1 patient started as early as 1 year of age, before significant hormonal effects were likely as the authors note.

Kinin inactivation pathways may be one such mechanism. Speculation about possible mechanisms of symptom reduction in pregnancy suggests potential fruitful areas for further study. For example, are there hormonal factors in pregnancy, not operative during estrogen therapy, that increase kinin inactivation or other factors and reduce angioedema, despite an estrogeninduced lowering of C1-INH? Is the fetus or placenta a source of kinin inactivation factors or other factors that mitigate the effects of estrogen-induced lowering of C1-INH? Does variation in fetal production of kinin-inactivators or other factors underlie any variation in angioedema symptoms between pregnancies in the same individual, or between individuals in the same families, all with the same C1-INH mutation?",

            "text": "Angioedema caused by acquired deficiency of the inhibitor of the first component of human complement (C1-INH), usually referred to as acquired angioedema, is a rare, life-threatening disease first described by Caldwell et al. 111 Characteristic of acquired C1-INH deficiency are the increased consumption of C1-INH and the hyperactivation of the classical pathway of human complement. 112 As a consequence, these patients have almost undetectable serum levels and/or activity of C1-INH, C4, C2, and C1q, r, and s. Usually, these abnormalities are constantly present, but temporary normalization of 1 or more of these parameters has been reported. 113 The clinical manifestations of the disease mimic those of the inherited defect of C1-INH and include subcutaneous, nonpruritic swelling without accompanying urticaria; involvement of the upper respiratory tract manifested as dysphagia, voice change, or respiratory stridor; and partial obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract presenting as colicky abdominal pain. 7 Angioedema caused by acquired C1-INH deficiency differs from HAE by the absence of a family history of angioedema and a late onset of symptoms (in the fourth decade of life or later). Response to treatment varies compared with HAE caused by the C1-INH hypercatabolism characteristic of acquired C1-INH deficiency. 114 Acquired C1-INH deficiency is frequently reported in association with B lymphoproliferative diseases. Different forms of B lymphoproliferation can occur, ranging from benign monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) to true malignancies. 115 In 1986, autoantibodies inactivating C1-INH were first detected in patients with acquired C1-INH deficiency. 127 Initially, autoantibodies inactivating C1-INH were identified in otherwise healthy patients. On the basis of this observation, it was proposed that 2 separate forms of acquired C1-INH deficiency existed: type I, paraneo-plastic, mainly associated with lymphatic malignancies; and type II, autoimmune, caused by autoantibodies to C1-INH. The latter form appeared to be characterized further by elevated serum levels of cleaved C1-INH. 128, 129 Because cleaved C1-INH was not invariably found to be present in the serum of patients with so-called autoimmune acquired C1-INH deficiency, 115 this division has been questioned. 130, 131 Furthermore, autoantibodies to C1-INH were later described in patients with associated diseases. These autoantibodies were found to be common in patients with MGUS and frequently exhibit the same isotype of the M component. 115, 132, 133 Autoantibodies to C1-INH impair C1-INH function. Although the exact mechanism for such impairment remains controversial, 7,122 the majority of these autoantibodies appear to enhance C1-INH cleavage by target proteases, preventing their inactivation. A recent article on 23 patients with acquired C1-INH deficiency followed for as long as 24 years (median, 8 years) demonstrated that half of the patients with malignancies also had autoantibodies to C1-INH, either at the time of onset of angioedema or later in the course of disease, indicating that autoimmune acquired C1-INH deficiency is not distinct from the acquired C1-INH deficiency that occurs in the setting of malignancies or other diseases. Detection of autoantibodies to C1-INH in a patient with acquired C1-INH deficiency should not decrease the importance of considering the possibility of an associated pathologic condition. Compared with the general population, patients with acquired C1-INH deficiency presented higher risk for B-cell malignancies. In patients with acquired C1-INH deficiency, the risk for progression of MGUS to malignancy was not higher than in other patients with MGUS. 134",

The modified mismatched bases are subjected to piperidine cleavage reactions, and the resulting fragments are separated and identified by gel electrophoresis. 167 This method is, in principle, well suited to detect mutations independent of the length and sequence composition of the examined region and capable of detecting nearly all single-base mismatches. It has been successfully developed in a large number of studies (reviewed in Ellis et al 168 ) , including those of the C1NH gene to detect pathogenic mutations and analyze its polymorphism. 169 Even if all mutations could potentially be detected, the efficiency of chemical modification and cleavage of the CCM depends on type of the mispairing and the stability of the adjacent sequences. In consequence, some mismatches are poorly cleaved, with their mutations subsequently undetectable via CCM. 170 The need for a method suited to identifying most anomalies in the C1NH gene, including point mutations and short and medium-sized deletions or insertions, prompted some groups to take advantage of CCM and fluorescent probes with the development of fluorescenceassisted mismatch analysis. 154, 171, 172 Denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) uses an alkylated nonporous poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) matrix and an amphiphilic ion gradient enabling separation of homoduplexes and heteroduplexes by means of ion-pair reversephase liquid chromatography (reviewed in Xiao and Oefner 173 ) . Illustrative examples of its application in C1NH gene studies are given in Fig 11. The most important advantage of the DHPLC method is its easy automation by using a mechanical sampler.",

The need to ascertain the consequence of C1NH mutation on C1-INH expression and function prompted investigators to develop experimental systems adapted to both transcription and protein expression studies. Patient peripheral blood monocytes and fibroblasts were successfully developed to study C1-INH synthesis in pathological conditions. 156, [187] [188] [189] It then became interesting to correlate C1NH gene anomalies with transcription and translation defects, specifically with reference to serpin function, without the need for patient cells. Pathological mutations can now be introduced in C1-INH cDNA expression systems and transfected into cell lines suitable for biosynthesis experiments. 91, 155, [190] [191] [192] [193] Serpin function is routinely assessed in plasma samples (see Varga et al in the following Laboratory Diagnosis section). Some type II mutant C1-INH proteins have been described with respect to their atypical interactions with the target protease. 161 A more complete model of nonfunctional C1-INH mutants can yield insights into the C1-INH inhibitory mechanism and aid in the development of a relevant dynamic 3-dimensional model of the C1-INH molecule. 162 Knowledge of these type II mutant C1-INH proteins allows every mutation to be associated with its corresponding serpin control failure, as proposed in a 3category classification scheme 162 : class I includes mutations that lead to altered exposure of the active site, with consequences on protease specificity (denoted \u00a7 in Table  IV) ; class II mutations convert C1-INH protein into a substrate, with subsequent inefficient protease trapping (denoted \u00e0 and k in Table IV) ; and class III encompasses mutations with a spontaneous insertion of the reactive loop, either into the same molecule or another molecule entirely (denoted k and { in Table IV) . Finally, as posited by Cumming et al, 183 it is important to correlate mutations with disease expression. However, on the basis of most clinical data, disease expression cannot be attributed to specific mutant proteins. Variable clinical presentation is thought to result from genetic or nongenetic elements distinct from the C1NH gene. In laboratory practice. Every index case characterized by impaired C1-INH serpin function and ruled not to be of an acquired origin can be submitted to a genetic analysis. To ensure an economical and reliable strategy, an algorithm is proposed in Fig 15. Currently, to be exhaustive, the conjunction of scanning methods and Southern hybridization or exon multiplex technology is required to detect most mispaired or unpaired sequences and rearrangements, respectively. Every nucleotide change detected from the index case has to be analyzed in the family members, keeping in mind that de novo mutations are not uncommon. As stated, and in particular when detected in introns, every new mutation without a known significance has to be distinguished from a polymorphism in the C1NH gene after establishing its absence in the relevant healthy population (from at least 100 chromosomes) and its segregation with the disease.",

Nonetheless, the pathogenesis of this clinical condition remains incompletely understood. In the following section, Hack briefly reviews the biochemistry and biology of C1-INH as well as the biochemical changes that occur in persons with C1-INH deficiency during both attacks and symptom-free periods. On the basis of these reviewed data, Hack then discusses the potential pathogenesis of C1-INH deficiency angioedema. Often, HAE results from a deficiency of C1-INH. An interesting feature, revisited in the previous Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis section, is the great variance of the disease's clinical course. Some patients are virtually free of attacks even in the absence of treatment, whereas others, despite therapy, have attacks nearly every week. Angioedema attacks result from the extravasation of fluid caused by increased vasopermeability. Unlike angioedema of allergic origins, angioedema caused by HAE typically does not itch. Pain is often not a primary feature of such angioedema, although it may manifest secondary to the localization of the angioedema, eg, severe pain caused by obstruction of the bowel lumen. In spite of decades of research, the pathogenesis of HAE attacks is still unclear.",

            "text": "C1-INH biochemistry and biology. C1-INH belongs to the family of serine protease inhibitors, or serpins, which also includes proteins such as a1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III [194] [195] [196] [197] (Fig 16) . Most serpins have only 1 or a few target proteases, but C1-INH is exceptional in this respect. It is the major inhibitor of several proteases, including (1) C1s and C1r-two serine proteases that, together with C1q, constitute the C1 complex of the classical pathway of complement, (2) the mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine proteases or MASPs, and (3) the contact system proteases factor XIa, factor XIIa, and kallikrein. 198 In addition, C1-INH may interact with several proteases such as thrombin, 199 plasmin, 200 and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). 201 Thus, C1-INH regulates the activity of several inflammatory, clotting, and fibrinolytic proteases and is therefore an inhibitor of several pathways of inflammation. 198 In comparison with other serpins, C1-INH is a relatively weak inhibitor, approximately 100 times less effective than other serpins. However, the inhibitory activity of C1-INH toward C1r, C1s, and factor XIa can be remarkably potentiated by heparin and other glycosaminoglycans. 202, 203 The inhibitory activity of C1-INH to factor XIIa and kallikrein cannot be potentiated. Dextran sulfate is the most effective glycosaminoglycan, enhancing C1-INH function 130-fold in vitro and 60-fold in plasma. However, the in vivo effect of dextran sulfate is transient, probably because of dissociation of the dextran sulfate-C1-INH complex and the subsequent rapid clearance of dextran sulfate. 204 Mature C1-INH consists of 478 amino acids and is heavily glycosylated (approximately 30% by weight). Although on SDS-PAGE gels it migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 104 kd, its calculated molecular weight is 76 kd. The C1-INH molecule has at least 13 glycosylation sites 205 and possibly 20 glycosylation sites, part of them linked to threonine residues. Most carbohydrate groups are located at the N-terminal region; their function is largely unknown. The C1-INH molecule is composed of an N-terminal domain of 113 amino acids and a serpin domain of 365 amino acids. Although the function of the N-terminal domain is unknown, recent evidence suggests that it helps to stabilize the central bsheet by forming 2 disulfide bridges linking cysteine 101 to cysteine 406, and cysteine 108 to cysteine 183. 206 The structure of the serpin domain is homologous to that of other serpins and is essential for the inhibitory capacity of the molecule. Recently, a novel 3-dimensional model of C1-INH was proposed on the basis of the crystal structure of 4 other inhibitory serpins. 162 Similar to other serpins, C1-INH inhibits proteases by binding to their active site via its reactive center. This reaction follows the equation",

Mutations of the residues at the P14, P12, and P10 positions in the reactive center interfere with efficient loop insertion and cause the reaction to proceed to step 3. In that case, C1-INH has become a substrate for its target proteases. Such mutations have been found in some patients with HAE-II (characterized by the presence of dysfunctional C1-INH protein). Complexes between modified C1-INH* and proteases are very stable and only very slowly dissociate into an inactive, modified C1-INH (with changed conformation caused by a completed insertion of the cleaved active site loop into the 5-stranded b-sheet) and an active target protease (step 3 in the equation). Most of the stable complexes will be removed from the circulation before dissociation via receptors specific for complexed serpins.

Woo et al 207 reported that the synthetic rate of C1-INH may increase as much as 2.5 times the normal rate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Cytokines such as interferon-g stimulate the synthesis of C1-INH. 208 In normal volunteers, the fractional catabolic rate of C1-INH is 2.5% of the plasma pool per hour, which results in an apparent plasma half-life time of clearance of about 28 hours. 90 The half-life time of clearance of human C1-INH in rabbits is comparable, at 26 hours, 209 whereas that in rats is considerably shorter, at about 4.5 hours. 210 The apparent half-life time of clearance is markedly longer in patients with HAE, in whom it may exceed 48 hours, as determined by assessing the course of plasma concentrations after the intravenous administration of exogenous C1-INH. 211 However, at low plasma concentrations of C1-INH, such as occur in untreated patients with HAE, C1 is autoactivated 212 and consumes functional C1-INH. At higher C1-INH concentrations such as occur after the administration of exogenous C1-INH, this autoactivation is inhibited, leading to a decreased consumption of C1-INH. Hence, monitoring of plasma concentrations after a therapeutic dose of C1-INH may lead to an overestimation of the half-life caused by inhibition of consumption of endogenous C1-INH. Removal of sialic acids greatly enhances the clearance of C1-INH from the circulation, yielding an apparent half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, 209 presumably by binding to asialoglycoprotein receptors in the liver. Subsequent removal of penultimate galactosyl residues largely restores the clearance rate to a value similar to that of normal C1-INH. 209 Activation of cascade systems in HAE. As mentioned, C1-INH regulates the activation of at least 3 different so-called plasma cascade systems, ie, the classical and MBL pathways of complement via its effect on C1r, C1s, and the MASPs; the contact system via its effects on kallikrein and activated factor XII (factor XIIa); and the intrinsic pathway of coagulation via its effect on activated factor XI (factor XIa). 213 In addition, it may regulate coagulation to some extent via its effects on thrombin, and it may regulate fibrinolysis through its effect on tPA and plasmin. Except for the MBL pathway, there is evidence for activation of all of these systems in patients with HAE.",

Typically, patients with HAE have low C4 and C2 but normal C3 values even during attack-free periods. Low C4 and C2 result from uncontrolled activation of activated C1 because the concentration of activation products of C4, C4b/c, or C4d is elevated. 213, 214 Activation of C3 is typically low or absent, probably because of efficient control of activation at the level of C4 by C4 binding protein and factor I. This continuous activation of the classical pathway is attributed to enhanced autoactivation of C1, because this autoactivation process is dependent on functional C1-INH values. 212 However, it is now clear that the classic pathway of complement may be activated by apoptotic cells through various mechanisms. [215] [216] [217] Hence, one could postulate that the excessive activation of the classic pathway in untreated patients with HAE results from activation of this pathway by cell debris. Indeed, Familian and Hack have observed increased amounts of complement activation products in patients with HAE (Unpublished data, November 2002), reflecting activation via the penetraxin serum amyloid P component, 1 of the proteins that can bind to apoptotic cells. 218 Ongoing activation of the classical pathway in untreated patients continuously produces activated C2.",

            "text": "The contact system of coagulation consists of the proteins factor XII (also known as Hageman factor), prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen. 219 The system is activated in vitro on contact with negatively charged surfaces, but the nature of potential activators in vivo is currently unknown. Activation of the system yields factor XIIa and kallikrein. C1-INH inhibits both proteases. In addition, kallikrein can also be inhibited to some extent by a2-macroglobulin. Kallikrein can cleave HK, yielding cleaved HK and bradykinin. The latter nonapeptide is a potent inducer of vasodilation and increased vasopermeability. Activation of this system is often assessed by measuring factor XIIa-C1-INH and kallikrein-C1-INH complexes, 220 although these parameters are unsuitable to assess activation in HAE. Alternatively, activation can be measured by detecting increased amounts of cleaved HK or decreased antigenic quantities of the contact system proteins. Activation of the contact system in HAE typically occurs during attacks and is hardly detectable during attack-free periods. 221 In particular, increased amounts of cleaved HK are found in most, if not all, patients with attacks. 17, 222, 223 Remarkably, nearly all HK is often cleaved during attacks, such that native HK is hardly detectable. It is questionable whether all HK cleaved during an attack gives rise to bradykinin, given its extremely potent activity as a vasodilator. Bradykinin is known to cause a significant drop in blood pressure even at low concentrations, yet hypotension is not characteristic for HAE. However, there are no data supporting the cleavage of HK via other degradation pathways during HAE attacks such as would generate minimal or no bradykinin. It should be noted that the measurement of bradykinin in plasma or other body fluids is hampered by its rapid degradation by carboxypeptidases and is only possible using samples collected in special inhibitor cocktails to prevent enzymatic degradation. Few studies have attempted to measure bradykinin according to such protocols in HAE, but these studies have shown increased bradykinin generation during attacks and not during symptom-free periods, particularly when samples are drawn from the site of the edematous swelling. 13, 14, 27 C1-INH is a major inhibitor of factor XIa of the intrinsic pathway of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation 143, 224 and also inhibits thrombin, 199 although inhibition of this latter enzyme is likely physiologically inconsequential. The role of factor XI in coagulation is not yet resolved. Originally, coagulation was considered to proceed via at least 2 different pathways, the intrinsic and the extrinsic, merging at the level of factor X into a common pathway of thrombin generation. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by exposure of factor VII to tissue factor, whereas the intrinsic pathway is triggered by factor XII activation, eg, upon contact of blood with negatively charged surfaces such as glass. In this view, activation of factor XII led to thrombin generation via activation of factor XI, which then activated factor IX, which together with factor VIIIa activated factor X, which then together with factor Va activated prothrombin. This traditional distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic pathway has been left behind, and the intrinsic pathway is now considered to amplify extrinsic pathway activation in that factor IX amplifies factor VIIa-induced activation of factor X, whereas factor XI, activated by thrombin, activates additional factor IX. According to this revised scheme of coagulation, the activation of factor XI is no longer mediated solely by factor XIIa but also may occur with significant thrombin generation. In the traditional scheme of coagulation, C1-INH is expected to have a major effect on intrinsic pathway activation because it blocks the activity of factor XIIa, kallikrein, and factor XIa, whereas according to the current understanding, C1-INH has only a limited effect on coagulation, with its main effect the inhibition of factor XIa-mediated amplification of factor IX activation. Clinical observations in HAE do not support that C1-INH deficiency is a major risk for thromboembolic disease, although some generation of thrombin may occur during attacks. 222 This mild effect of C1-INH is easily understood through the revised scheme of coagulation.",

Nonetheless, significant plasmin formation, as measured by the formation of plasmin-a2-antiplasmin complexes, occurs during attacks in patients with HAE but hardly at all during symptom-free periods. At present there is no evidence for tPA or urokinase-type plasminogen activator involvement in the formation of plasmin during HAE attacks. As such, this generation most likely results from factor XII activation. Although debated in the literature, convincing in vivo evidence exists to support the activation of plasminogen in human beings by factor XIIa. 225, 226 Angioedema attack pathogenesis: Mediators of angioedema. Angioedema is a frequently experienced side effect for patients receiving ACE inhibitors. This angioedema does not itch, is not associated with urticarial lesions, and does not respond at all to corticosteroids or antihistamines, features also typical of angioedema associated with C1-INH deficiency. ACE inhibitors slow down the processing of C-terminal arginine residues of various vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin and bradykinin, thus prolonging the biological activity of these compounds. The association between ACE inhibitors and angioedema is a strong argument that this condition may result from exposure of the endothelium to increased levels of vasoactive peptides. Considering the similarities between ACE inhibitor-related angioedema and that caused by C1-INH deficiency, the latter form also likely results from enhanced exposure of the endothelium to vasoactive peptides. Studies in a few patients indicate that bradykinin may be the vasoactive peptide involved. 13, 14, 27 Considering that contact activation in HAE mainly, if not exclusively, occurs during attacks, and that activation of this system results in the liberation of bradykinin from HK, most investigators currently believe that C1-INH deficiency angioedema results from the local generation of bradykinin caused by uncontrolled proteolytic activity of factor XIIa and kallikrein (Fig 17, bottom) . 15 Kallikrein has 2 important effects in contact activation: it (1) amplifies factor XII activation via so-called reciprocal activation, and (2) releases bradykinin from HK. This mechanism of contact activation and bradykinin generation as the basis for angioedema is supported by observations in the murine model of C1-INH deficiency, because the enhanced vasopermeability in this model can be blocked with bradykinin receptor antagonists. 9 According to this mechanism, inhibiting kallikrein or blockading bradykinin receptors (BKR-2) would be therapeutic options; as discussed in the Treatment section of this supplement, both are currently being investigated in clinical trials.",

Third, ACE inhibitors have been shown to result in the delayed breakdown of bradykinin, and part of their hypotensive effects are actually blocked by bradykinin receptor antagonists. 227 However, some strong arguments exist against this mechanism as the sole explanation for angioedema. First, bradykinin is a strong vasodilating agent and among the most hypotensive agents known, whereas HAE attacks are not known to be associated with clear hypotensive reactions. Nonetheless, one could argue that most bradykinin is generated locally, at the site of edema formation, rather than in the circulation. Second, the local injection of bradykinin results in a strong pain sensation, 228 whereas primary, localized pain is not typical for HAE attacks. Third, contact activation cannot explain the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid. It has been suggested that these agents are efficacious by reducing plasmin formation during attacks, which would lead to the reduced consumption of functional C1-INH by plasmin. In spite of this, it is difficult to understand how active plasmin would be capable of mediating C1-INH consumption, because it is rapidly inhibited by a potent plasmin inhibitor, ie, a2-antiplasmin. Moreover, in most patients with HAE, rather than being elevated, the concentration of cleaved C1-INH (free C1-INH* in the equation) is fairly low. Finally, although vasopermeability seems to be enhanced and dependent on bradykinin formation in C1-INH-deficient mice, these permeability changes do not appear to occur in bouts and are otherwise atypical for angioedema. For all of these reasons, other mechanisms may be involved in HAE attacks.",

This peptide can be generated by cleavage of the C2b fragment, but not from native C2, by plasmin, and is therefore called C2-kinin. 229 This C-terminal fragment of C2b can be generated by C1s or plasmin. Mediation of attacks by this fragment requires activation of multiple plasma cascade systems: (1) complement, to generate activated C2; (2) the contact system, to generate factor XIIa; and (3) the fibrinolytic system, to generate the C2-kinin generating enzyme, plasmin. According to this mechanism, attacks are triggered by factor XII activation that then yields plasmin, which in turn cleaves the C2-kinin sequence from C2b (Fig 17, top) . The attractive aspects of this controversial mechanism include its explanation of the efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents. Furthermore, one may postulate that C2-kinin does not induce vasodilation, explaining why HAE attacks are not associated with hypotension and may not induce sensations of pain, and why angioedema in general does not hurt. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the biologic properties of C2-kinin are not well established, and thus, it is not truly known whether this kinin's properties are consistent with the description. Moreover, receptors for this kinin have not been identified, and it is therefore unknown whether their distribution correlates positively with the localization of attacks. In addition, there are no data regarding concentrations of C2-kinin in patients with HAE. Finally, if correct, the C2-kinin mechanism provides no explanation for the profound cleavage of HK and the apparent lack of biological activity of bradykinin.",

            "text": "Triggers of angioedema attacks. Clinically, HAE attacks are often triggered by trauma or emotional stress. Attacks of HAE are specifically associated with activation of the fibrinolytic and contact systems, whereas complement activation occurs continuously, independent of clinical symptoms. Activation of the fibrinolytic system can occur via 3 plasminogen activators: tPA, urokinasetype plasminogen activator, and factor XII. There is no evidence that the former 2 are involved in plasmin formation during attacks; hence, it likely results from factor XII activation. Thus, attacks are triggered by activation of factor XII. Though factor XII (Hageman factor) was discovered in the 1950s, physiological activators of this contact system protein have not yet been identified. In vitro, factor XII is easily activated by glass and other negatively charged compounds such as dextran sulfate. Obviously, these compounds are not relevant as activators of the contact system in vivo. The author writes that recently, his group has studied the generation of thrombin by phospholipid microparticles released in vivo from activated platelets and damaged cells. 230 By using various specific mAbs against tissue factor, factor VII, factor XI, and factor XII, they noticed that a small but significant part of thrombin generation by microparticles purified from human plasma was dependent on factor XII. Indeed, earlier studies have clearly indicated that factor XII can be activated by phospholipids in vitro. 231, 232 Apparently, factor XII can be activated by phospholipid microparticles in vivo. Damaged or apoptotic cells generate such particles, and one may therefore postulate that these particles constitute triggers for contact activation. Under normal conditions, ie, at normal concentrations of C1-INH, this weak activation will never yield substantial contact activation. However, in the absence of sufficient amounts of this inhibitor, the system may become profoundly activated by even small amounts of microparticles via the principle of reciprocal activation (factor XII activates prekallikrein into kallikrein, which in turn activates additional factor XII, and so on). Microparticles and damaged cells are likely generated during trauma, which may explain why this is a trigger for angioedema attacks. Emotional stress as a trigger for attacks is more difficult to understand, although one may speculate that it predisposes patients to microtrauma. Support for this hypothesis is that occasional patients have been described who, in spite of acquired C1-INH deficiency, are free of symptoms. Two such patients had detectable antibodies against phospholipids. 125 These antibodies might interfere with the binding of factor XII to phospholipid microparticles or damaged cells. Further studies are needed to provide evidence toward this hypothesis of HAE attack generation.",

Therefore, one may speculate that the frequency of attacks is strongly linked to an individual's tendency toward factor XII activation. If true, attack rates might be influenced by the concentration of factor XII as well as by the amount of factors that compete with factor XII for binding to its activator molecules. As discussed, in the case of phospholipid microparticles, antiphospholipid bodies may prevent factor XII from binding to the particles, conferring protection against the activation of factor XII. Older literature has revealed several proteins capable of competition with factor XII for binding to artificial activators. 233, 234 The concentrations of these competing proteins might well determine whether factor XII may become activated on exposure to an activator and therefore influence HAE attack frequency.

This release is initiated by the uncontrolled activation of factor XII, leading to kallikrein and plasmin formation. The trigger for attacks may be phospholipids, released from damaged cells, that activate factor XII. Factor XII's ease of activation may be determined by its concentration as well as the concentration of proteins that compete with it for binding to activators, and may explain the variable frequency of attacks in patients.",

            "text": "Others, assuming bradykinin to be the principal mediator of nonallergic angioedema attacks, have begun work toward bridging the gap between C1-INH deficiency and local angioedema generation. Bolstered by the increasing evidence that ACE inhibitors [235] [236] [237] can cause AAE in a small percentage of individuals, investigators have sought to determine whether-independent of C1NH gene sequence-an increased liberation of bradykinin, a decrease in its catabolism, or a combination of the 2 may contribute to the angioedema experienced in HAE, AAE, and related disorders. Phenotypic characteristics. Mating of heterozygousdeficient mice produced the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio of C1-INH 1/1 :C1-INH 1/2 :C1-INH 2/2 mice. As observed in human heterozygotes, C1-INH expression was less than 50% of normal in heterozygous mice; homozygous C1-INH knockouts did not produce detectable plasma concentrations of C1-INH. In male but not in female mice, carrying the defective C1-INH gene correlated with a slight but statistically significant decrease in weight. The growth of both heterozygous-deficient and homozygous-deficient mice appeared normal, with no more newborn deaths observed than in wild-type littermates. Limited analysis of serum C4 concentration in heterozygous-deficient and homozygous-deficient mice revealed that homozygotes had 38% to 59% as much C4 as their wild-type littermates, constituting a significant mean difference from wild-type; C4 in heterozygotes was more variable, ranging from 49% to 120% of wild-type. The group also reported that total hemolytic complement activity in the sera of null homozygotes was reduced compared with wild-type. Although the C1-INH 1/2 and C1-INH 2/2 mice were not observed to have spontaneous attacks of skin edema, 2 heterozygotes and 3 homozygous knockouts developed spontaneous abdominal distension secondary to intestinal wall edema. Because these mice were euthanized, it is unclear whether these episodes would have spontaneously resolved. No such episodes of abdominal edema were observed in wild-type littermates.",

            "text": "Bradykinin, race, and ACE. In 1996, Gainer et al published the results of a clinical trial evaluating wheal response to bradykinin among African Americans and white Americans. 241 In this randomized, double-blind study, increased bradykinin dose, hypertension, and African American race each correlated with an increased wheal response to bradykinin. Further investigations by the same group compared the effects of short-term ACE inhibition in normotensive and hypertensive individuals of both races. In this study, the hypotensive effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril were shown to be greatly reduced in all subjects by concomitant administration of the bradykinin receptor 2 antagonist Icatibant. 227 Icatibant was also shown to significantly alter the change in plasma renin activity in response to ACE inhibition. These results not only confirmed the importance of bradykinin in the short-term effects of ACE inhibitors but also suggested that bradykinin contributes to the effects of ACE inhibition on the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, when considered together, these results suggest that clinicians prescribing ACE inhibitors for patients of Afro-Caribbean descent should be especially aware of the possibility for drug-related angioedema, a warning beginning to be supported by case analysis. 242, 243 Further antihypertensive-related angioedema. Initially, AT2 blockers were thought to be a safer alternative for patients who had angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors. Unlike ACE inhibitors, AT2 blockers have not been shown to increase bradykinin concentrations. Nonetheless, further case reports documented angioedema after therapy with AT2 blockers. 137, 244 In a survey of the literature, 32% of these patients also had similar episodes in conjunction with ACE inhibitor treatment. 245 Additional documented cases of AT2 blocker-associated angioedema threw bradykinin's role in the pathogenesis of such episodes into doubt 246 because increased concentrations of bradykinin are not associated with AT2 blocker use. 245 However, very recent work has shown that increased concentrations of AT2, such as would occur during a blockade of AT2 receptors, are associated with an increase in the expression of bradykinin receptors that may be almost 3-fold. 247 Thus, increased opportunities for bradykinin binding may explain angioedema in the absence of extra bradykinin. The mediator for this receptor crosstalk effect has been shown to be the AT2 receptor 1. 247 (Presumably, this phenomenon could occur in the presence of AT2 receptor 1 blockers only in the absence of a total blockade.)",

Patients receiving ACE inhibitors showed elevated plasma bradykinin concentrations throughout ACE inhibitor therapy, both during attacks and during periods of remission. 13 As documented in 1 patient, this increase reverted to normal on discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy. 14 In contrast, patients with C1-INH deficiency were shown to have high concentrations of bradykinin during their attacks 13 but have been documented to have normal or marginally increased amounts of bradykinin during periods of remission. 14 At least in C1-INH deficiency, bradykinin increases may be highly localized; in 2 previously studied C1-INH-deficient patients, bradykinin concentrations in blood draining from an angioedematous site were 3 and 8 times as high as those measured in systemic circulation.",

Each of these mechanisms may be involved in at least 1 form of nonallergic angioedema. Pathways for the breakdown of bradykinin are depicted in Fig 21. Decreased or alternative catabolism. Molinaro et al 252 have demonstrated that in human plasma, bradykinin is metabolized mainly by 3 metallopeptidases: ACE, APP, and kininase I (carboxypeptidase N). Of these, ACE and APP, respectively, are the first and second major pathways of inactivation. Kininase I represents a minor pathway unless ACE is inhibited, whereupon kininase I transforms bradykinin into its active metabolite des-Arg9-bradykinin, which, in turn, is inactivated by APP and ACE, with APP the major inactivating metallopeptidase. 253 NEP, as discussed in the context of vasopeptidase inhibition, likely represents another minor pathway.",

In fact, Adam et al 96 have found a correlation between low APP activity with a history of angioedema among patients receiving ACE inhibitors. Likewise, in their Estrogen-dependent and Estrogen-associated inherited angioedema piece earlier in this supplement, Binkley and Davis propose reduced APP activity as a contributing element in estrogen-sensitive inherited angioedema.

As Hack discussed in the Pathogenisis and Pathobiology of HAE and AAE section, C1-INH is known to inhibit not just C1 esterase but also other serine proteases, including factor XII (Hageman factor). In addition, C1-INH inhibits the serine protease kallikrein. Without the controlling effects of C1-INH, it is possible that both of these serine proteases may contribute to an increased generation of bradykinin. This reaction is thought to occur at the endothelial cell surface. The way in which this unchecked bradykinin generation starts has been debated, with recent evidence supporting the secondary role of factor XII, 260, 261 and placing the conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein, likely by an enzyme such as prolylcarboxypeptidase, 262, 263 foremost, at least under resting physiologic conditions. It is thought that once kallikrein is present, it catalyzes the activation of factor XII. Only in the presence of activated platelets, neutrophils, or lymphocytes can the high local concentration of free zinc ions necessary for factor XII to bind to the endothelial cell surface-and thus initiate bradykinin release-occur. 263 This provides yet another example of how infection or tissue damage might aggravate an existing tendency to angioedema.",

In addition, because angioedema has been reported in patients treated for acute ischemic stroke who received recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA; often concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor), Molinaro et al 252 undertook an in vitro comparison of human plasma incubated with and without rtPA in the presence of an ACE inhibitor.

They identified this factor as heat shock protein 90. Perhaps this mechanism might account for angioedema attacks that occur in the wake of trauma or infection when ruptured cells spill their contents into local circulation. Indeed, increased kallikrein may be a feature of mechanical trauma: an experiment conducted more than 20 years ago demonstrated that mechanically generated blisters in 5 of 5 patients with HAE contained active kallikrein that could be inactivated by C1-INH concentrate or antibodies to plasma kallikrein. In contrast, blister fluids from 6 of 8 healthy subjects did not contain detectable amounts of plasma kallikrein. 265 Last, these anabolic effects might be created or magnified by hormonal interactions. As noted by Binkley and Davis, 92 estrogens may increase the expression of factor XII 107,266-268 and prekallikrein. 269 Increased uptake. Various factors may increase gene expression of the B1 and B2 receptors. Not normally expressed, the B1 receptor has a high affinity for kinin metabolites. 270 Expression of B1 receptors may be induced during inflammation and tissue damage. 271, 272 Although B2 receptors are constitutively expressed, 273 their expression may be increased by estrogens 274 and AT2 receptor antagonists. 247 In summary. Despite increasing evidence that bradykinin is indeed the major mediator of nonallergic angioedema, this knowledge does not represent a simple answer given the many variables governing bradykinin and its metabolites. However, an understanding of this web of chemical interactions may yield more successful management algorithms for the various types of nonallergic angioedema. This recent knowledge also suggests a place for bradykinin receptor antagonists and kallikrein inhibitors for the control of nonallergic angioedema, especially when it occurs in the presence of functional C1-INH.",

Bradykinin is thought by many to be the principal candidate mediator of angioedema genesis, and a mouse model demonstrated that angioedema is mediated by bradykinin via B2 receptor. 9 In human beings, studies have shown local elevations in bradykinin concentration during HAE attacks. 13, 14 It is speculated that factor XIIa, kallikrein, and thrombin may be increased as well.

This work has since been published in Clinical Endocrinology. 294 Objective. The fluctuations of sex hormone concentrations at the beginning of adolescence, in the perimenopausal period, and during pregnancy or OC use can precipitate HAE attacks. Edematous attacks usually disappear after the onset of menopause. The authors undertook their study to establish any relationship between serum concentrations of sex hormones and the incidence of HAE attacks.",

Therefore, serum progesterone concentrations above the postmenopausal threshold are predictive of a higher incidence of edematous attacks in female patients with HAE.

Their study crosses the barriers of C1-INH deficiency and HAE type classifications to investigate the effects of exogenous hormones on HAE. The new type of inherited angioedema recently described by their group has clinical features highly similar to classic HAE-I and HAE-II; however, it is not associated with a C1-INH deficiency. Currently, the genetic defect is unknown. Until now, the disease has been observed exclusively in women 8, 86, 87 ; however, in 2 families the existence of clinically unaffected male carriers has been deduced. 8, 86 In the following report, the authors show that estrogens play a similar role in HAE-I and this new type of inherited angioedema, herein described as HAE with normal C1 inhibitor (HAE type III) in accordance with the original report of this condition by Bork et al. 86 Among their case series, the authors observed female patients with HAE who had newly developed recurrent angioedema after receiving OCs or postmenopausal HRT. In addition, other women had a worsening of their preexisting angioedema after initiating OCs or HRT, suggested that these treatments might trigger HAE. However, this possible relationship has not formally been investigated, nor is angioedema listed as an adverse effect of OCs or HRT. [295] [296] [297] Information regarding the relationship between hormone administration and the first occurrence or worsening of HAE symptoms is limited to anecdotal reports. 8,22-24,31,32,86,87,107,275,276,277a,299 In this study, a systematic approach was used to obtain information about the relationship between the use of OC or HRT and the clinical manifestation of HAE-I and HAE with normal C1-INH (HAE type III).",

Six of the women evaluated in their study had new angioedema attacks or exacerbation of preexisting disease after receiving estrogens alone, and their symptoms did not differ from those of women who received estrogens plus progestins. Moreover, progestins have even been used for treatment of HAE caused by C1-INH deficiency, and improvement of disease has been observed in at least some of the patients treated. [302] [303] [304] Most important in the current context, progestin treatment has not been associated with worsening of angioedema. The causative role of estrogens in disease exacerbation suspected in this and other reports is also supported by the fact that attenuated androgens are effective in preventing edema attacks in HAE caused by C1-INH deficiency. All of these observations are consistent with the view that estrogens and not progestins are responsible for provocation of angioedema attacks or worsening disease in women with inherited angioedema who take OC or receive HRT.",

As stated, available evidence suggests that bradykinin is involved in the development of symptoms in patients with HAE caused by C1-INH deficiency. 9, 14, 30 In addition to its inhibitory effects on C1s and C1r, C1-INH blocks the activity of other plasma proteases including kallikrein and factor XIIa/XIIf, enzymes that participate in bradykinin formation. Bradykinin is generated from HK by kallikrein; the activation of prekallikrein to kallikrein is mediated by activated factor XII. The degradation of bradykinin to des-Arg bradykinin and finally vasoinactive peptides is mainly mediated by carboxypeptidase N (kininase I) and angiotensin I converting enzyme (kininase II). 30 Estrogencontaining medications might favor edema formation by influencing both kinin generation and degradation. Gordon et al 107 showed that C1-INH levels in the plasma of women taking OC are lowered. Administration of estrogens also leads to increased factor XII levels, possibly via a functional estrogen response element in the promoter of the gene encoding factor XII. 30, 107, 280 Plasma concentrations of prekallikrein have also been shown to be increased in women using estrogen-containing OC. 269 Estrogens might also influence the degradation of bradykinin via their influence on ACE. It has been demonstrated that HRT in postmenopausal women leads to a decrease in ACE activity. 257, 292, 305 Nogawa et al 292 also observed an increase in plasma bradykinin levels in such women, a finding consistent with the action of ACE in the breakdown of bradykinin.",

For diagnostic purposes, the C1-INH protein phenotypes of the various types of angioedema without an allergic or pseudoallergic background are important (Table VI) . Mutations in the coding region of the C1-INH gene leading to HAE are all heterozygous conditions. (There is 1 known exception, an Italian family with a homozygous defect in the gene control region that might have evolved because of multiple consanguinity. However, even as a homozygous mutation, this defect did not lead to a complete deficiency of C1-INH. 171, 238 ) HAE-I is defined as the presence of 1 mutant C1-INH gene whose gene product is undetectable in the circulation by routine methods. However, ultrasensitive methods might detect abnormal protein in some patients diagnosed with HAE-I by routine analysis. In these patients, a reduced amount of normal C1-INH is found (Table VI) . HAE-I may result from the production of a missing mutant protein, eg, from a mutation resulting in a stop codon, production of a mutant protein that is subsequently degraded intracellularly, production of a mutant protein that is not secreted and that might accumulate intracellularly, or production of a mutant protein that is released but rapidly catabolized or degraded in the circulation.",

In a large HAE-affected family in northern Norway, children with the disease had their first typical symptoms at 3 to 4 years of age. However, in 1 case, a mother noticed different phonation, edema of the mouth and tongue, and enlargement of the uvula in her 6-month-old child, arising during a period of primary teeth eruption. 24 Even if HAE often makes it debut later, the statement in a review on the management of HAE in pregnancy in the journal Anesthesia that ''HAE is always asymptomatic in infancy'' 313 is misleading. Early infancy is a likely age for the first manifestations, and physicians dealing with newborns with HAE-affected parents should suspect an underlying C1-INH deficiency as a potential cause of symptoms such as unspecific recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, upper respiratory disease, or skin rashes. Therefore, a reliable diagnosis of children born to HAE-affected parents is required as soon as possible. A C1-INH concentration or functional activity <50 % of normal, in conjunction with low C4 concentration, supports a diagnosis of HAE. 314 Tools for laboratory diagnosis. Life-threatening laryngeal edema in association with inadequate C1-INH function in untreated or poorly treated patients has been reported to have a lethality of 14% to 30%. 7,31,315 Because C1-INH functional deficit might remain clinically silent for decades, the high lethality because of acute airway obstruction underscores the importance and significance of awareness of this syndrome and the availability of an expert laboratory to assess C1-INH functional deficiency.",

C1-INH function can be assessed by several methods. 316 When analyzing samples from a patient with HAE-I before and 30 minutes after C1-INH concentrate infusion, considerable differences emerge in rise of apparent C1-INH function, depending on which method is applied (Table VIII) . C1-INH function, when assessed by enzyme-based chromogenic assays, results in a linear relationship with the antigenic concentration of the C1-INH protein. The chromogenic substrates used are EtCO-Lys (e-Cbo)-Gly-Arg-pNA (formerly from Immuno, Vienna) or MeCO-Lys (e-Cbo)-Gly-Arg-pNA (Aventis Behring, Marburg, Germany). Some reports favor the assessment of C1-INH function by loss of immunologically reactive C1r. The method uses the natural substrate C1r of C1-INH as the indicator and works exclusively with endogenous complement. By using this inexpensive type of assay system, one can observe a functional threshold value for C1-INH concentration and function. 138 Formation of C1-INH-C1r or C1-INH-C1s complexes can be assessed by an ELISA test system that also uses the natural but exogenous substrate of C1-INH as an indicator. By commercial ELISA tests based on the detection of formed C1-INH-C1s complexes, the median functional concentration is less than 50% of normal at the time of diagnosis (Table IX, (Table IX) .

In Hungary, a borderline C4 concentration was found in only 1 of 25 newly diagnosed patients with HAE. Thus, for an inexpensive follow-up, assessment of C4 concentration might suffice.

To confirm or disprove a suspicion of clinical HAE-I, measuring the concentration of C1-INH protein is satisfactory; however, this is not adequate to detect HAE-II or AAE type II. Assessment of C1-INH function is therefore required. Normal functional C1-INH concentrations can be observed in patients with HAE under therapy when measured by assays based on the formation of C1-INH-C1r/C1s complexes. If the analyzing laboratory is unaware of this fact and receives a sample from a patient not known in the laboratory, a diagnosis of HAE might be missed. In contrast, C1-INH measurements using commercial enzyme-based chromogenic assays yielded a false diagnosis of HAE in 26% of samples. 330 The positive predictive value for a diagnosis of C1-INH deficiency was only 36% with the chromogenic assay, whereas it was 92% with the C1-INH-C1s ELISA test kit. The negative Measurement of C4 concentration can be used as a screening marker when HAE is suspected. However, low C4 is not sufficient for diagnosis, because this is seen in many conditions with classic pathway activation. If C4 and the antigenic concentration of C1-INH are both normal, C1-INH functional deficiency can be excluded. Low C4 concentration is also a characteristic feature of AAE. Diminished amounts of C1 or its subcomponents, preferably C1q, are indicative of an acquired C1-INH deficiency. However, low C1 (q, r, s) together with low C4 is not a proof for AAE (Table VI) . A normal complement profile (normal antigenic C1-INH, C1q, and C4) was reported in 2 patients with AAE. 113, 331 In the latter case, a transient improvement in C1-INH function was associated with a transient loss of anti-C1-INH autoantibodies.",

The use of such an algorithm is strongly advised because, on Follow-up of patients. According to the literature, C1-INH concentrations in HAE-I patients greater than 35% to 40% of normal are sufficient to provide inhibition of classical pathway activation, a finding that is confirmed by clinical observations. Thus, in such patients, the dose of attenuated androgens should not be increased with the aim to reach antigenic C1-INH levels approximately 50% of normal. Ignorance of this fact might provoke higher and higher doses of, eg, attenuated androgens that bring no added benefit for C1-INH function and might harm the patient's liver. Enzyme-based chromogenic substrate assays are excellent for initial diagnosis of deficient C1-INH function, but seem less well suited for monitoring during therapy (Table VIII) . Measurement of C4 concentration is an inexpensive and generally useful parameter, even to follow up therapy, and especially in AAE. Concentrations of C4 close to the lower limit of normal, ie, at the lower 95% limit of confidence, have been found to indicate sufficient function of C1-INH to allow patients to be attack-free (Fig 24) .",

It has a high affinity and is highly selective for kallikrein. It is effective in abating acute attacks of HAE but is not yet commercially available. 343 Bradykinin antagonists.

However, it contains nonproteinogenic amino acids and is not degraded by the 2 main bradykinin cleaving enzymes, carboxypeptidase and ACE. A potent antagonist, Icatibant has the same affinity for B2 receptors as bradykinin across several tested species, including human beings.

Later, further androgens, fluoxymestrone in men and oxymetholone in women (with fewer virilizing effects than methyltestosterone), were tested. In 1959, stanozolol was synthesized, having 1 of the largest anabolic/androgenic ratios. In 1963, danazol, a synthetic analogue of ethinyltestosterone and less virilizing than the early synthetic androgens, was developed. In 1976, the attenuated androgen danazol was shown to considerably reduce the number of HAE attacks. 347 Since then, attenuated androgens (17-a alkylated androgens), mostly danazol or stanozolol, have been widely used for long-term prophylaxis in HAE. 348, 349 Although 17-a alkylated androgens are more efficient than other androgens, they are metabolized by the liver. Thus, hepatotoxicity and the induction of liver cell adenoma or carcinoma are major concerns. Androgens' mechanisms for exerting beneficial effects in patients with HAE are unknown.",

Like other acquired forms of protein deficiencies, the course of acquired C1-INH deficiency can be related to the course of the underlying disease. The possibility of reversing the biochemical and/or clinical abnormalities of acquired C1-INH deficiency by curing the associated disease was reported by Cohen et al 105 and subsequently confirmed. 122, 132, [370] [371] [372] However, the response can be temporary, even without evidence of relapse of the associated disease. 373 Analogous to HAE, patients with acquired C1-INH deficiency have received attenuated androgens for prophylaxis and C1-INH concentrate to treat acute attacks. 334, 347 Nevertheless, these patients are frequently resistant to attenuated androgens, 114, 371 whereas they tend to benefit from antifibrinolytic agents. 114, 133, 374 Antifibrinolytics are thus more effective for long-term prophylaxis in this population and represent the first choice for patients with acquired C1-INH deficiency. 134 Replacement therapy with C1-INH plasma concentrate is the treatment of choice for life-threatening laryngeal attacks. However, patients with AAE partially resistant to this treatment have been reported. 114, 129, 356, 375 The response to treatment differs from HAE because of the rapid catabolism of C1-INH that characterizes AAE. Higher doses of C1-INH plasma concentrate were required in patients with a slow response to treatment. 112 Slow responsiveness is a high-risk condition because it seems to increase with subsequent treatment. A new peptide, DX-88, a synthetic kallikrein inhibitor based on the same functional domain (Kunitz domain) of aprotinin, is under study for treating angioedema in patients with HAE. 342, 343 By inhibiting kallikrein activation, this peptide can stop generation of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin from HK, 18 For HAE and related conditions, plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate remains the acute attack therapy of choice.

These drugs significantly changed the treatment procedures for acute attacks in patients with HAE, becoming the treatment standard in the countries where Berinert P is available. In countries where Berinert P or another C1-INH concentrate was not available (for example, the United States), treatment of acute attacks was and sometimes still is usually performed with FFP. However, during the preparation of FFP, no reduction of potentially present viruses is achieved, in contrast with the plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate Berinert P. Similarly, although solvent-detergent treated FFP might seem an alternative, this treatment does not inactivate nonenveloped viruses.

In general, plasma-derived products may potentially transmit infectious and/or pathogenic viruses. This risk is minimized by careful selection of donor centers with regard to virus marker rates (epidemiology) and careful selection of donors; each donor, including qualified donors (ie, repeat donors), is evaluated before each donation for vital signs including temperature and blood pressure and subjected to an intensive questionnaire. Details have been described recently. 376 Furthermore, every donation is tested with serologic methods for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and antibodies against HCV, HIV-1, and HIV-2 as well as elevated alanine aminotransferase levels. In addition, sample pools of donations are tested by using nucleic acid amplification technique (NAT)/PCR for genomic material of hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, HIV-1, and high titers of parvovirus B19 (B19V). Reactive donations are discarded. Furthermore, the plasma pool for fractionation is tested and released for further processing only if the pool is nonreactive (negative) for HbsAg and nonreactive for antibodies against HCV, and HIV-1, and HIV-2 as well as nonreactive for HAV RNA, HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HIV-1 RNA, and for B19V DNA not exceeding 10 5 IU/mL. The third main step ensuring virus safety is the elimination and inactivation of possible viral contaminants by the manufacturing procedure, whose capacity for virus reduction is tested in virus validation studies. The virus inactivation/removal steps used in the manufacture of Berinert P use treatment in aqueous stabilized solution at 60\u00b0C for 10 hours (pasteurization) and specific chromatography.",

In virus validation studies designed to assess the capacity of the manufacturing process to inactivate and/or eliminate intentionally added virus, high overall virus reduction factors were demonstrated (Table XII) . These virus validation studies were performed in accordance with the applicable Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) Notes for Guidance. Viruses covering a wide range of physicochemical properties were used in these studies (HIV-1 and HAV are relevant viruses, bovine viral diarrhea virus [BVDV] and canine parvovirus [CPV] are specific model viruses for HCV and B19V, respectively, and pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a nonspecific model virus for large enveloped DNA viruses). The results demonstrate that the pasteurization and the manufacturing process of Berinert P effectively inactivate and/or eliminate relevant human pathogenic viruses. To demonstrate that the manufacturing steps explored in the virus validation studies were very robust and that variations in the manufacturing procedure had no effect on the virus reduction capacity, specific studies covering parameters beyond production specification were performed. These studies showed that even under these conditions, a very effective virus inactivation occurred. Regarding analysis of postmarketing surveillance for Berinert P from 1985 until now, no cases of proven virus transmission, according to the assessment of the Global Pharmacovigilance Department at Aventis Behring, were reported, although a total of almost 100 million units of Berinert P were administered.",

The outbreak of AIDS in the 1980s and the resulting infections caused by blood transfusion and treatment with certain plasma derivatives, mainly factor VIII concentrates, showed that virus safety in plasma proteins is a field of permanent attention, screening, and continuous research. Since the former Behringwerke AG introduced pasteurization in the 1980s (developed by Heimburger primarily for hemophilia products), no HIV transmission via the company's pasteurized products has occurred. [377] [378] [379] This pasteurization procedure has been adapted to Aventis Behring's plasma products, including C1-INH concentrate. The pasteurization procedure has been shown to have an excellent track record of virus safety, and the validity of the pasteurization for virus inactivation was confirmed in scientific articles. [380] [381] [382] Pasteurization is a very effective and robust virus inactivation method, but there are also limits. Animal parvovirus, for example, is inactivated by pasteurization only to a certain degree. However, because of recent findings, it should be kept in mind that the human B19V is heat-sensitive and can be effectively inactivated by pasteurization; preliminary data from the group's own experiments (data not shown) also confirm this observation for stabilized aqueous solutions. 383 In addition, antibodies against B19V in the plasma pool for fractionation and in intermediates derived from that pool will neutralize B19V to a high degree. Furthermore, regarding CPV, the specific chromatographic step was validated for its capacity to remove CPV, and a very effective and robust removal could be demonstrated. In conclusion, on the basis of the data from virus validation studies, 2 independent effective virus reduction steps in the production procedure for Berinert P, effective for a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, could be demonstrated.",

This audit suggests that patients who carried their own supplies of C1-INH concentrate were less likely to have difficulties in accessing appropriate care and were less likely to have ill effects.",

Three different plasma-derived C1-INH preparations are licensed by regulatory authorities in 1 to 3 European countries each. Even where licensed and/or available, treatment with plasma-derived C1-INH often is restricted to laryngeal attacks with risk for suffocation, severe abdominal attacks, and preoperative prophylactic use. These restrictions have grown out of viral safety concerns, although the risks of transmission of human pathogenic viruses may nowadays be considered minimal. 75 Long-term prophylactic treatment with plasmaderived C1-INH, although apparently safe and efficacious, occurs only on a very small scale. 356 Plasma-derived C1-INH has also been tried in several serious pathological conditions such as sepsis, vascular leakage syndromes, and acute myocardial infarction, ie, in conditions associated with excessive activation of the complement and contact systems and/or absolute or relative deficiency of functional C1-INH. 198, 396 Although its application in these conditions appeared safe, its efficacy was not yet demonstrated unequivocally.",

            "text": "Rationale for production of recombinant human C1-INH. Until very recently, all animal and clinical studies with C1-INH used human blood plasma-derived C1-INH. Although the advantage of this C1-INH preparation is that it has normal clearance kinetics, normal specificity, and no antigenicity, the apparent disadvantages are that the source material is limited and potentially contaminated with blood-borne pathogens. In particular, the limited source is an obstacle to develop C1-INH for indications other than HAE because these indications require more C1-INH than for the treatment of HAE (eg, approximately 15-25 U/kg body weight for an HAE attack vs 200 U/kg for the treatment of myocardial infarction). Hence, availability of recombinant C1-INH is warranted. Major advantages of production of human C1-INH via recombinant DNA technology are that the recombinant material is not derived from a human source, that the production can more easily be controlled, and that the production can be scaled up to meet the requirements for the investigational treatment of HAE as well as other potential indications. 198 On cloning of C1-INH by Bock et al, 205 recombinant functional C1-INH was expressed in COS-1 cells by Eldering et al 190 in the late 1980s. The C1-INH expressed in this way was fully active, but expression levels were low (approximately 1 mg/L), thus allowing only structurefunction relationship studies. 190 Expression in Escherichia coli was also attempted. Though much larger quantities of protein were expressed, only a fraction (a few percent) was active, whereas the majority was denatured (Hack et al, Unpublished data, January 1990). Similar observations have been made by Lamark et al, 397 although these investigators could obtain more functional C1-INH preparations by using different vectors and different strains of E coli. Hence, other expression systems are needed to produce recombinant C1-INH for clinical applications. Two such systems, expression in transgenic animals and a yeast system, are discussed here.",

Expression of C1INH via the mammary gland of transgenic animals was first attempted in rabbits, among others, because of rabbits' short generation time. In addition, a lactating rabbit may produce 10 L milk per year; because of this, transgenic rabbits may yield sufficient quantities of recombinant human C1-INH (rhC1-INH) for the HAE indication. A mammary gland-specific expression vector containing a bovine milk-specific promoter sequence (aS1 casein) functionally linked to the gene encoding human C1-INH was introduced into the rabbit germ line by microinjection of fertilized oocytes isolated from superovulated female donor animals. A production line was selected with a relatively low transgene copy number and that expressed rhC1-INH in milk at levels exceeding 10 g/L. To ensure continuous availability of a herd of transgenic animals from the selected founder line and to restrict potential rearrangements of the transgene through subsequent generations, a Master Transgenic Bank and a Manufacturing Working Transgenic Bank have been established. Production herds are housed in specially designed and validated facilities subject to stringent environmental monitoring.

Nonreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE of rhC1-INH showed rather broad (single-chain) protein bands with an estimated relative molecular mass (Mr) of approximately 90,000. The observed heterogeneity in Mr on SDS-PAGE of rhC1-INH as well as the difference in Mr (approximately 15,000 and 10,000 on nonreduced and reduced SDS-PAGE) of rhC1-INH and plasma-derived C1-INH most likely results from differential glycosylation. This follows from the observation that both the N-terminus and C-terminus of the protein are intact as determined by N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequence analyses. Moreover, liquid chromatographymass spectrometry peptide mapping data revealed approximately 70% recovery of the amino acid sequence of rhC1-INH and conformity with the expected amino acid sequence. The theoretical molecular mass of the polypeptide backbone of C1-INH is approximately 53 kd. The use of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy revealed a molecular mass of approximately 67 kd and approximately 73 kd for rhC1-INH and plasma-derived C1-INH, respectively, and suggests that approximately 21% and approximately 28% of the molecular mass of rhC1-INH and plasmaderived C1-INH can be ascribed to carbohydrate structures. Monosaccharide analysis of the major monosaccharides in glycoproteins (Fuc, GalNac, GlcNac, Gal, Man, and Neu5Ac) confirmed that rhC1-INH consists of approximately 21% carbohydrates. N-glycolyl neuraminic acid, a sialic acid that is not found in normal human tissue, as well as a-galactosyl were not detected on monosaccharide analysis of rhC1-INH. Mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the glycans released from rhC1-INH indeed showed the presence of at least 4 different O-linked and at least 7 different N-linked carbohydrate structures, including oligomannose and hybrid and complex-type carbohydrates. 398 N-linked glycan profiling indicated that most of the N-linked complex structures of rhC1-INH appeared to be monosialylated. The inhibitory potency of rhC1-INH toward the target proteases C1s, kallikrein, factor XIa, and factor XIIa was found to be comparable with that of plasma-derived C1-INH. In addition, no difference in the inhibition of plasmin and thrombin was observed. Physicochemical characterization to demonstrate identity, purity, potency, and consistency between different batches of rhC1-INH revealed that it was consistently being produced as an active, intact molecule, with purity exceeding 99.98 %, containing no detectable amounts of cleaved rhC1-INH, endogenous rabbit C1-INH (less than 1 ppm), and rabbit milk proteins (less than 20 ppm).",

In rat serum samples from animals in the highest dosage group (single-dose, 1250 U/kg; subchronic, 625 U/kg), a mild specific immune response was noted.

The profiles of functional C1-INH showed a full initial recovery and a dose-dependent clearance of rhC1-INH that indicated a saturable mechanism of elimination. After the infusion of rhC1-INH at 100 U/kg, a clearance of approximately 13 mL/min, a half-life of about 3 hours, a volume of distribution of about 3 L, and an endogenous infusion rate of about 2 U/min were observed by using a standard 1-compartment model of analysis. Application of a 1-compartment model with Michaelis-Menten elimination provided dose-independent estimates of V max , K m , volume of distribution, and endogenous infusion rate of approximately 45 U/min, approximately 0.6 U/mL, approximately 3 L, and approximately 12 U/min, respectively. Thus, the half-life of rhC1-INH in the subjects with HAE appeared reduced compared with historical data of plasma-derived C1-INH. 211, 334, 335 This likely relates to the differential glycosylation and lower degree of sialylation in rhC1-INH. The increased clearance of rhC1-INH from the bloodstream likely occurs mainly through endocytic asialoglycoprotein and mannose receptors on hepato- cytes. 209 After dosing with rhC1-INH at 100 U/kg, functional C1-INH was at least 2-fold the normal level for about 2 hours and remained above 0.4 U/mL for about 9 hours. Activation of the cascade systems releasing inflammatory mediators responsible for the generation of edema is thought to be sufficiently controlled with functional C1-INH levels exceeding 0.4 U/mL. 138 Pharmacodynamics results were as follows. rhC1-INH displayed biological activity in the subjects as evidenced by plasma C4 increases and inhibition of C4 cleavage. The dose-dependent increase in mean normalized C4 was highly variable within dosage groups and was approximately 2-fold increased after the infusion of rhC1-INH at 100 U/kg. C4 peak levels occurred at approximately 12 hours postinfusion, similar to C4 responses after plasmaderived C1-INH, and thereafter gradually declined to baseline. 211, 335 An immediate dose-dependent effect of rhC1-INH on plasma C4b/c was observed. The magnitude and the duration of the decrease in C4b/c appeared dependent on the dose of rhC1-INH.

In the original publication by Bock et al 205 describing the nucleotide sequence of cDNA coding for human C1-INH, 13 glycosylation sites were identified. However, the number of potential glycosylation sites (N-linked and O-linked) may be as high as 28. The function of these carbohydrate groups is not completely clear, although there is conclusive evidence that incomplete glycosylation and/or undersialylation of the carbohydrate groups is involved in the clearance of the molecule in vivo. 209 On the basis of migration patterns of yeast-expressed C1-INH on SDS-PAGE as well as current knowledge of glycosylation by yeast (mainly mannose), it is expected that carbohydrate groups on yeast-expressed C1-INH will need to be modified to achieve normal clearance in vivo. Indeed, in a rat model, accelerated clearance of Pichia-expressed C1-INH was observed (half-life, 20 minutes for Pichia-C1-INH vs 3.5 hours for plasma derived C1-INH; Bos et al). 400, 401 Expression of C1-INH mutants. C1-INH mutants have been made for different purposes, ie, to study the structure and function, to study glycosylation, and to modify function toward applicability in inflammatory conditions. Regarding application in inflammatory conditions, C1-INH, like many other serpins, can be catalytically inactivated by neutrophil elastase, which may limit its use in inflammatory diseases. To improve the potential performance of C1-INH at sites of inflammation, it may be beneficial to enhance the resistance of the molecule to catalytic inactivation by elastase, because this would reduce the amount of inhibitor needed. C1-INH mutants with amino acid replacements at the so-called P3 and P5 positions of the reactive center (this is the domain interacting with target and nontarget proteases) have been developed. 402 These mutants have a nearly normal function but are much more resistant to inactivation by elastase than wild-type C1-INH. Until now, these mutants have never been tested in animal models to prove the principle that they indeed perform better in inflammatory conditions.",

As such, this process resulted in a molecule with an extremely high (44pmol/L) binding affinity for human plasma kallikrein. Kallikrein is known to catalyze the conversion of kininogen to bradykinin. 254 Assuming bradykinin is the major mediator of nonallergic angioedema, 28 plasma kallikrein inhibition should be beneficial during angioedema attacks. Kallikrein has also been shown to influence the renin-angiotensin system by promoting the conversion of prorenin to renin 262 ; however, as discussed in the pathogenesis section of this supplement, the renin-angiotensin system likely plays a much lesser role in angioedema generation.",

In this dose-ranging study, 3 patients each received 10 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg intravenous DX-88. One patient (40 mg DX-88; genital edema) had a drugrelated anaphylactoid reaction. Patient-reported times to the start of attack resolution ranged from 25 to 240 minutes (mean, 92 minutes); patient-reported times to complete resolution ranged from 2 to 72 hours (mean, 38.6 hours).

Although these agents are effective in many patients, they carry a wide range of side effects, many of which are undesirable. Their mechanism of action in these diseases, and indeed the full extent of their systemic effects, is not entirely known. As illustrated by the following investigations, attenuated androgens such as danazol may have other, at least transiently positive effects in addition to their better-documented risks. Attenuated androgens effectively prevent swelling attacks in HAE. 351 The attenuated anabolic steroid danazol is mainly used in the therapy of many estrogendependent diseases such as endometriosis, cystic fibrotic mastopathy, primary menorrhagia, primary pubertas praecox, and gynecomastia. 403, 404 However, its other, less known clinical indication is the prophylaxis of HAE. 351 The high androgen and low estrogen levels caused by this drug 25, 405 are responsible for some side effects. Among these, seborrhea, acne, hirsutism, weight gain, hair loss, voice changes, clitoral hypertrophy, vaginitis, irregular menstruation or amenorrhea, and reduced breast mass are the most common. 349 Methods. This study investigated the effects of danazol on bone metabolism. Low estrogen concentrations have previously been shown to play a role in the development and progression of osteoporosis. The authors' current investigation sought to discover how reduced estrogen production caused by danazol therapy influences bone turnover. According to available data, danazol's effects on bone metabolism have been investigated only in patients with endometriosis. [406] [407] [408] [409] These investigations gave contradictory results. In addition, the authors note that the danazol doses given to treat endometriosis in these studies far exceed the doses administered in HAE. Rock et al 410 have reported a temporary increase in bone mineral density (BMD) lasting only for the 24 weeks of treatment, which then decreased such that BMD values measured at the 72nd week were lower than the initial values. According to Dodin et al, 411 the lumbar bone mass slightly increased by the end of the third and sixth months. 366, Dmowski et al 412 found no significant change in BMD during the danazol treatment.",

            "text": "Ovarian follicular fluid (FF) is an enzyme reservoir controlling the permeability of the capillaries of the antrum and proteolytically degrading collagen, thus leading to the rupture of the follicle wall. The plasminogen-activator-plasminogen hypothesis is the most likely explanation of the mechanism initiating the cascade that leads to follicular rupture. The preovulatory follicle, stimulated by gonadotropins, secretes urokinasetype plasminogen activator, which can convert plasminogen to plasmin. A latent collagenase activated by plasmin attacks collagen, and the resulting telopeptidefree collagen can be attacked and degraded by nonspecific proteases. The decrease of the tensile strength of the follicle wall then allows the rupture of the follicle by the action of the existing intrafollicular pressure. 413 In addition to several multifactorial systems (eg, kinins and fibrinolysis) that have been demonstrated and characterized in human FF, the presence of active complement has also been demonstrated in amounts similar to those present in normal human serum. 414 Plasmin's activation of complement in FF is very important for the function of the enzymatic multifactorial mechanism of ovulation. After complement activation in FF, biologically active peptides such as C3a, C4a, and C5a are released via the complement cascade. Complement activation is also important for the assembly of the membrane attack complex on the follicle wall. 414 Complement activation and ovulation: Consequences in HAE. It has been clearly demonstrated that women of reproductive age with HAE who were not under danazol treatment and off any therapy, including OCs, frequently had cystic ovaries with an ultrasound pattern of polycystic ovaries (PCOs; approximately 35%) or of multifollicular ovaries (MFOs; approximately 55%). 415 Although PCOs in women not affected with HAE are associated with increased LH and testosterone concentrations, and MFOs with almost normal values of these hormones, in patients with HAE, normal concentrations of LH and testosterone (and of prolactin, cortisol, and ACTH) are almost always demonstrable independently from the ultrasound pattern (PCO, MFO, normal) but in the presence of significantly reduced follicle stimulating hormone and slightly increased LH:follicle stimulating hormone ratio. Menstrual irregularities and oligomenorrhea are frequent features of the patients studied, and hirsutism is sometimes present in patients with HAE both with PCO and MFO.",

In fact, both PCO and MFO are linked to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, 417 and in HAE, 1 of the features of such a dysfunction, ie, high plasma b-endorphin concentrations and normal ACTH, is present in many patients, including men, postmenopausal women, and girls who are not of reproductive age. 416 Influences on ovulation. The presence of both complement and ovarian abnormalities in patients with HAE and the role of FF complement in ovulation induced the authors to study complement function in the FF of women of reproductive age affected with HAE. They found that impaired complement function is present in FF obtained from female patients of reproductive age affected with HAE. In fact, contrary to what had been observed both in previously studied women not affected with HAE 415 and in controls, HAE patients' FF showed a dramatically decreased classic pathway activity as well as undetectable functional and antigenic C1-INH, and very low C4. In addition, the authors observed a slightly reduced or within normal serum range values for alternative complement pathway activity, including C3 and factor B. This complement profile was also detected 415 in the patients' sera. 418 It is well known that the multifactorial mechanism of ovulation involves 2 relevant steps modulated by C1-INH: (1) the formation of plasmin, and (2) the plasmin-dependent complement classical pathway activation. 414 Activation of FF complement is important for the correct continuation of the ovulatory process, and the lack of C1-INH, which facilitates the formation of plasmin and plasmin-dependent complement activation, can, in theory, be beneficial. On the contrary, when the activation of complement is massive, as occurs during HAE attacks, a significant release of biologically active complement products can induce consistent inflammation and, in turn, pain. Abdominal pain is frequently encountered in female patients with HAE during attacks and during ovulation as well. However, because complement is chronically consumed during remissions and dramatically consumed during HAE attacks, the potential of complement activation in HAE FF is indeed the result of complex interrelated phenomena.",

However, once significant time has elapsed since the last HAE attack, complement function can ameliorate; if ovulation coincides with such a condition, it will meet an only mildly reduced complement that will be capable of participating in the rupture of the follicle wall. These considerations can explain the apparently undiminished reproductive capacity of female patients with HAE. On the other hand, HAE patients' FF complement supports a certain degree of activation by seminal plasma, 419 possibly caused by the relative integrity of the alternative pathway supporting its participation in the phenomenon. It is nonetheless possible that the more difficult rupture of some follicles in HAE and the consequent altered intraovaric regulation by atresic follicles can result in the PCO and MFO frequently observed in the disease. 415 It is known that in cystic ovaries, the rupture of the cysts is very painful; thus, the authors cannot exclude that in patients with HAE, the rupture of ovarian cysts might contribute to the genesis of the dramatic abdominal pain during attacks.",

One of the mainstays in the management of HAE is long-term therapy with danazol, a mild androgen capable of correcting low C1-INH concentrations and of greatly reducing the typical symptoms of the disease. 350 The authors therefore studied the effects of danazol on ovarian FF C1-INH and on ovarian ultrasound pattern. Six patients with HAE affected with cystic ovaries (3 with PCO and 3 with MFO) who had been off any therapy for at least 1 year were treated with danazol (200 mg daily). As a result of danazol treatment, HAE clinical symptoms consistently improved, and C1-INH serum concentrations increased. After 6 months of therapy, these patients were monitored by pelvic ultrasound scanning, and their ovaries were found normal. Serum C1-INH and FF C1-INH also increased. Furthermore, when the ultrasound pattern of the ovaries was studied in another group of patients, women with HAE of reproductive age who were usually under danazol treatment, cystic ovaries were found in only 1 of 9 patients (11%).",

Unfortunately, treatment of acute attacks that manifest with circumscribed swelling of the skin and the subcutaneous tissues can be performed successfully only by administering C1-INH concentrate. 420 Other medications that are usually helpful in edema of other origins (eg, antihistamines or corticoids) are not effective here. 421 The authors report that F of their patients, when anamnestically well evaluated, had edema of the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract at least once; remarkably high lethality rates (as high as 30%) have been associated with this disease in the past. 31, 44, 421 Even recently, a mortality rate as high as 12.5% was published in an article summarizing experiences with Austrian, Swiss, and German patients with HAE. 422 As previously discussed, bradykinin seems to be the major mediator of edema, but discussions have not yet been finalized. 9 Because this disease still bears unknown details thus far identified, the authors chose to examine the baseline parameters of patients with HAE to broaden the general database available and to enhance the understanding of the medical and scientific community.",

In their experience, this approach should also be feasible for women of childbearing age and all other patients with HAE who cannot tolerate the side effects associated with danazol treatment. Methods. Between 1987 and 2000, ninety patients were registered in the Hungarian HAE Center database. What follows is a review of the clinical data of 26 pediatric patients from 19 families. The male to female ratio was 11:15, and the age at time of diagnosis ranged from 2.5 to 15 years (mean, 7.3 years). CH 50 total complement levels were measured by the standard hemolytic titration method, using sensitized sheep erythrocytes. 425 The C4 complement fraction was determined by single radial immunodiffusion using anti-C4 antibodies (ATAB, Stillwater, Minn), and results were expressed as the percentage of standard, normal serum values. 426 The C1-INH concentration was also measured by radial immunodiffusion; C1-INH activity was measured by kinetic assay using a commercially available diagnostic kit (Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany). The activity of the C1-INH in the serum was determined by photometry and expressed as the percentage of standard, normal values.",

In particular, cluster- ing of edematous attacks during the menstrual period was observed in 4 girls. Nowadays, contraception is initiated in early adolescence. However, OCs can precipitate acute attacks, and therefore, these agents are not recommended for girls with HAE. 7 The incidence and severity of characteristic manifestations show substantial interindividual variation. Less than 5% of patients with HAE are asymptomatic, and 25% had symptoms only sporadically. Manifestations of the disease are common in 70% of patients and severe in 30% of this subpopulation. 7 Eleven of the 26 children followed up in this study had frequent and severe attacks.

In children, as in adults, edema of the extremities is the dominant manifestation; furthermore, abdominal attacks are more common than laryngeal edema. 7,31 Nevertheless, even rare occurrences of laryngeal edema should be considered real emergencies. Because of the small diameter of upper airways in children, relatively mild swelling of the mucosal lining causes substantial obstruction, and suffocation can therefore rapidly ensue. In view of these risks, referral to intensive care is justified to monitor the clinical course and ascertain the efficacy of treatment. In some patients, repeated administration of C1-INH concentrate may be necessary to achieve satisfactory control of edematous manifestations. This fact and the ineffectiveness of conventional agents (eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine) account for the invariably high mortality of the disease and emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis.",

Failure to evade this trap often leads to unnecessary interventions on patients already prostrated by the consequences of the acute edematous attack. 36, 427 The authors reviewed the medical history of their patients before diagnosis, revealing that 2 children had undergone exploration or laparoscopy during an acute abdominal attack, 1 of them twice. These interventions were clearly unwarranted, because no abnormality other than the edematous swelling of intestinal wall was ascertained. To avoid this diagnostic pitfall, the authors recommend close monitoring of the patient, volume replacement, parenteral medication, and assessment of therapeutic efficacy, all achievable by observing the patient for 24 to 48 hours. Abdominal ultrasound is a noninvasive and readily accessible diagnostic test that yields reproducible results, features particularly advantageous in pediatric practice. 39 The authors identify free peritoneal fluid and edema of the intestinal wall as invaluable sonographic clues for distinguishing abdominal HAE attacks from other pathologies commonly associated with ascites formation (such as intra-abdominal inflammation, autoimmune disease, tumors, and so forth). They recommend that, when all other acute abdominal disorders had been ruled out, C1-INH concentrate should be administered to afebrile patients without laboratory abnormalities, particularly to those with known HAE. Prompt symptomatic relief (or lack thereof) after C1-INH concentrate administration can then confirm or refute the tentative diagnosis.",

This preparation contains C1-INH; however, its use may be associated with alloimmunization or the transmission of infections. 7 The most appropriate therapy is the intravenous administration of C1-INH concentrate. Its dosage is the same for children and adults (ie, 500-1000 U). 320 In this study, acute HAE attacks were treated with C1-INH concentrate exclusively. This approach was highly effective, resolving clinical symptoms within an hour, and was not associated with adverse effects. C1-INH concentrate has been suggested as an ideal agent for permanent substitution, particularly for pediatric patients. Unfortunately, the short (72-hour) half-life and high cost ($310 per vial) of the concentrate preclude its use for continuous administration. 428 Furthermore, C1-INH concentrate is a blood product, and the theoretical risk of blood-borne infections cannot be completely excluded. Nevertheless, viral (HIV, HBV, HCV) safety of the concentrate is promoted by heat treatment as well as the establishment and continuous validation of safe plasma pools. 75, 334 In the Hungarian In pediatric patients, antifibrinolytic agents are the first choices for long-term prophylaxis because their safety profile is more favorable than that of attenuated androgens. 7, 31, 36, 429 Nevertheless, antifibrinolytic agents can cause adverse effects such as muscle weakness, myalgia, elevation of creatine kinase activity, vascular thrombosis, postural hypotension, and myonecrosis. 31 The experience of the authors showed tranexamic acid to be better tolerated than e-aminocaproic acid, which often caused gastrointestinal discomfort. However, when these agents fail to achieve satisfactory improvement, treatment with attenuated androgens (eg, danazol, stanozolol) is necessary. 312 Numerous studies performed on adult patients have demonstrated the efficacy of 17a-ethyltestosterone (danazol) manifested by the substantial relief of symptoms as well as the elevation of serum C4 and C1-INH concentrations. 347 Their mechanism of action has not yet been fully elucidated, and limited experience with their pediatric use has been obtained only in patients treated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. 430 Potential adverse effects of danazol include weight gain, myalgia, headache, tremor, libido changes, elevation of serum transaminase levels, microhematuria, menstruation irregularities, and hirsutism. 349 In addition, 2 reports have been published on hepatocellular adenoma formation observed in adults undergoing long-term, high-dose danazol therapy. 353 Nevertheless, using the lowest effective maintenance dose and intermittent dosage regimens can prevent adverse effects that would require the withdrawal of treatment. In the study population, the longest duration of danazol prophylaxis was 11 years. No drug-related adverse reactions or impairment of growth was recorded in these pediatric patients, with the exception of 1 case of delayed menarche with subsequent irregular menstruation probably caused by long-term treatment with 200 mg/ d danazol. Compared with age-specific percentiles of the Hungarian population, somatomental development was normal in all cases. Treatment prevented edematous attacks and elevated C4 and C1-INH concentrations significantly. Effective therapy eliminated the need for frequent hospitalizations for acute symptoms-along with their unfavorable psychologic sequelae-and thereby improved the patients' quality of life.",

Such procedures most commonly include dental procedures and tonsillectomy, but the potential consequences of endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia must also be emphasized. 365, 431 Although short-term prophylaxis is required less frequently for children than for adults, antifibrinolytic agents or attenuated androgens provide adequate protection if administered in higher than usual doses. Nevertheless, prophylaxis with C1-INH concentrate is the method of choice in patients with a history of severe attacks precipitated by similar procedures. 432 In addition, follow-up should also include the education of patients and their parents, as well as advice on the most suitable means of lifestyle modification. The activity of patients' self-help groups can lend vigor to such efforts. Early health education and meticulous follow-up initiated in childhood can successfully prevent social stigmatization and guarantee an improved the quality of life for adulthood. It is prudent to provide patients with HAE with a medical information card summarizing essential knowledge and methods of emergency help in several languages. When justified by their history, patients should be supplied with C1-INH concentrate to be kept at hand, ie, in the refrigerator at home, for emergencies. The data contained on the medical information card can prove an extremely useful aid for medical professionals relatively unfamiliar with HAE and help to ensure patients' safety.",

This process has uncovered some strongly held views among the world's patients who are not satisfied with the current treatment options and standards. This drumbeat of concern is prompting international leaders to re-examine the HAE treatment paradigm that almost always features androgens for prophylaxis, with acute attack therapy (C1-INH concentrate) administered only for gastrointestinal and/or life-threatening attacks. There is some very exciting and innovative work going on in Germany that quantifies patient dissatisfaction with the current treatment norm.

Untreated laryngeal swelling can result in death; angioedema of the small intestine can result in obstruction and mimic an acute abdomen. Ultrasound may be useful to distinguish between abdominal pain attributable to HAE and a true surgical emergency. Occasionally, erythema marginatum or a similar, nonwhealing, nonurticarial rash may precede angioedema attacks; at other times, there may be no warning. Episodes of HAE may present as early as late infancy and may vary, even within the same individual, in frequency, severity, and location. Attacks typically resolve within 72 hours but may persist as long as 5 days. AAE, although much rarer than HAE, often follows lymphoproliferative disorders or occasionally autoimmune, neoplastic, or infectious diseases. Drug-induced angioedema may closely follow initiation of a drug regimen (often an antihypertensive agent) or appear many months later, whereas estrogendependent angioedema seems to follow initiation of pregnancy, OCs, or HRT more immediately.",

The progression from low functional C1-INH concentrations to attack genesis is still under debate; however, bradykinin has been identified as a mediator of angioedema attacks, and, unlike other proposed mediators, has been found to correlate with attack localization in early studies. Nonetheless, this nonapeptide is unstable and cannot be measured via routine laboratory analyses. It is hypothesized that the local generation of bradykinin results in regional increases in vascular permeability.

In some patients, antifibrinolytics may be sufficient to prevent attacks; however, attenuated androgens more often reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Patients receiving longterm androgens, especially pediatric patients, should be monitored for undesirable hepatic effects and other consequences such as virilization or delayed menarche; Farkas et al suggest laboratory work-ups at intervals of 3 to 4 months. Androgen overdosing is to be avoided; Varga and other members of the Workshop laboratory diagnosis panel note that, in HAE-I, antigenic C1-INH concentrations approaching 35% to 40% of normal are often sufficient to prevent attacks, and therefore, aiming steroid prophylaxis to achieve a 50% antigenic concentration subjects patients to an unnecessary risk.",

However, what appears remarkably unique to HAE is that within the last 4 years, this bulk of information has been directly transferred into therapeutic approaches. The dream of research from the bench to the bedside is becoming real in HAE, and the rule that there is no interest in developing drugs for treating a small number of patients seems to have vanished. Revolutionary new techniques for identifying and producing drugs, such as peptide selection from phage display libraries and transgenic animals as source of recombinant proteins, have been implemented to obtain agents active in HAE.

Both short-term and long-term prophylaxis regimens are also discussed.Current treatment of acute edema episodes. Treatment for acute edema episodes of HAE must be evaluated regarding efficacy, safety, and cost. Laryngeal, pharyngeal, and tongue edema are life-threatening or may progress to a life-threatening state. In these cases, a drug therapy is necessary.During laryngeal edema, according to the state of respiratory distress, further emergency measures may become necessary to keep the upper airways open, such as the use of epinephrine, intubations, or cricothyrotomia. Abdominal attacks caused by intestinal wall edema may be extremely painful and are often associated with vomiting or diarrhea. Severe acute abdominal attacks should be treated; mild abdominal attacks may remain untreated. Skin swelling involving the extremities may also remain untreated. Drug therapy for acute attacks includes the following: C1-INH concentrate. C1-INH preparations are purified and pasteurized or vapor-heated concentrates from pooled human plasma and have a half-life of 64 hours. They are effective in preventing and treating acute attacks of HAE caused by C1-INH deficiency and are the treatment of choice where available. In Europe, C1-INH concentrate has been widely used since 1973. 333 A randomized, placebo-controlled trial 211,334 was conducted in 11 patients for a total of 55 attacks in the skin, abdomen, and larynx, in which relief was seen after C1-INH concentrate treatment. After C1-INH administration, 69% of the attacks responded after 30 minutes, and 95% responded after 2 hours. Another study focusing on laryngeal edema in 18 patients with HAE showed that, in 192 of 193 laryngeal edema episodes treated with C1-INH concentrate, response occurred within 30 to 60 minutes. 45 In the 1 remaining episode, response occurred within 4 hours. In other reports, 8 patients, 335,336 9 patients, 336 and 7 patients 337 with attacks of skin, gastrointestinal, or laryngeal edema were successfully treated with C1-INH concentrate.",

Longhurst, MA, MRCP, PhD, MRCPath,* London, UK)Although C1-INH concentrate is largely accepted as the current treatment of choice for HAE and AAE among practitioners who regularly treat these diseases, some governments and private healthcare institutions refuse to stock hospitals with this potentially life-saving medication or fund patients to keep a personal dose. In this section, Longhurst reports the results of a local audit investigating the effects of C1-INH concentrate availability on patients' lives.C1-INH concentrate is the treatment of choice for laryngeal and severe abdominal edema in patients with HAE and AAE and in the United Kingdom (UK) is usually administered in the nearest emergency department.45,334 However, C1-INH concentrate is not universally available in the UK and cannot be obtained quickly in an emergency. For this reason, the author recommends that patients keep 1 treatment dose (usually 500 IU) of C1-INH concentrate at home to bring to their local hospital for infusion in case of emergency. In addition, she recommends that the local hospital stocks C1-INH concentrate. Patients receive this if their family doctor (general practitioner) or local primary care trust (PCT) agrees to pay for it. Not all UK doctors and PCTs accept the need for patients to hold their own supply of C1-INH concentrate. All of the author's patients carry a letter detailing emergency management of HAE and giving contact numbers at which 24-hour expert medical advice is available. Despite this, several incidents and near misses have resulted from difficulties with access to C1-INH concentrate. The author's group's quality standard was that every patient should have timely access to C1-INH concentrate for treatment of severe or life-threatening attacks.Methods. Twenty-four patients attending the author's center with confirmed HAE or AAE, under follow-up for 5 to 48 months, were audited. The occurrence of HAErelated events and extent of access to C1-INH concentrate were determined by reviewing patient and pharmacy records.Results. Of 24 patients, 13 had access to C1-INH concentrate at home: 4 patients had been prescribed C1-INH concentrate before referral to the center, and a further 9 received C1-INH concentrate after a delay of 0 to 6 months. Despite the group's recommendation, 11 patients did not receive C1-INH concentrate. Of these, 3 did not have access to C1-INH at their local hospital.",

Carbon backbone of a 3-dimensional model of C1-inhibitor, with amino acids involved in HAE. This model is made by homology modeling and is based on the crystal structure of 4 other serpins. The a-helices are depicted in red, the b-strands in light blue. Amino acids mutated in HAE patients are depicted in yellow ball-and-stick. The reactive site, P1-Arg, is depicted in magenta ball-and-stick. Ineke Bos. Adapted with permission from Bos et al. 456 ",
