This novel polysaccharide is noncytotoxic and nonproliferating to normal lymphocytes as well as tumor cell lines at 0-1000 Ag/ml. It activated different subsets of the lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells (331%), T cells (102%), and B cells (39%) at 100 Ag/ml concentration. The significant activation of NK cells is associated with the dose-dependent killing of tumor cells by activated normal lymphocytes in a functional assay. Immune activation by RR1 in normal lymphocytes elicited the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-1h (1080 pg/ml), IL-6 (21,833 pg/ml), IL-12 p70 (50.19 pg/ml), IL-12 p40 (918.23 pg/ml), IL-18 (27.47 pg/ml), IFN-g (90.16 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a (2225 pg/ml) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (2307 pg/ml) at 100 Ag/ml concentration, while it did not induce the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-a and TNF-h. The cytokine profile clearly demonstrates the Th1 pathway of T helper cell differentiation essential for cell mediated immunity, with a self-regulatory mechanism for the control of its overproduction. RR1 also activated the complements in the alternate pathway, demonstrated by a stepwise increase in C3a des Arg components. Incidentally, RR1 stimulation did not produce any oxidative stress or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lymphocytes or any significant increase in nitric oxide production. The water solubility, high molecular mass, activation of lymphocytes especially NK cells, complement 1567-5769/$ -see front matter D activation, Th1 pathway-associated cytokine profile, together with a low level of nitric oxide synthesis and absence of oxidative stress confer important immunoprotective potential to this novel a-d-glucan.

Immune activation is an effective as well as protective approach against emerging infectious diseases [1] . Although immune system possesses a wide array of microbial detection and host defense mechanisms, pathogen evasion of the immune surveillance and destruction is a frequent occurrence. This escape of immune surveillance is also an important characteristic of several malignancies [2] .",

            "text": "The fundamental role of innate immunity in host defense is becoming clearer as analysis of the human genome continues to identify new genes serving innate immune function. The innate immune system detects the pathogens or the nonself intruders using specific receptors and responds immediately by activation of the immune competent cells, synthesis of cytokines and chemokines, and release of inflammatory mediators to eliminate or contain the intruders. Innate immune activation also triggers and paves the way for adaptive immune response by antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. The natural killer (NK) cells play a decisive role in the innate immune defense against virus-infected and malignant cells by virtue of their ability to recognize and destroy abnormal cells [3, 4] . Cytokines play crucial roles in regulating various aspects of immune responses. Among cytokines, interleukin (IL)-12 plays a central role in coordinating innate and cellmediated adaptive immunity [5] . Immune stimulation can provide both prophylactic as well as postexposure protection [6, 7] . Usually, these protective measures are correlated with synthesis of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-g, the cytokines of Th1 pathway of T cell differentiation associated with the adaptive immune system [8] . Several compounds that activate immune system such as microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), doublestranded RNA and DNA oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs, have been reported earlier [1, 9] . Stimulation of multiple receptors is reported to exhibit synergistic effect in cytokine production [10] . Complement activation cascade is another integral part of the immune system in which the cellular pathogens like intracellular bacteria are coated with complement components (opsonization) and readily undergo phagocytosis. Thus, complement activation plays an important role in microbial killing and is essential for transport and clearance of immune complexes.",

Stimulation by particulate h-glucans can also enhance the ability of macrophages to recognize and clear apoptotic cells through upregulation of the polysaccharide receptors [13] . Specific h-glucan receptors have been reported on various immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, NK cells as well as nonimmune cells including endothelial cells, alveolar cells and fibroblasts [12] . h-Glucans induce proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and IL-12 synthesis, required for IFN-g production and polarization of T helper cells to Th1 pathway [14] . h-Glucans have also been found to synergize with monoclonal antibodies to suppress and/or eradicate tumors [15, 16] . Yeast h-glucan has already been demonstrated to have significant degree of protection against anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) infection in a mouse model [17] . Furthermore, exogenous IFN-g and IFN-a/h are reported to modulate host's innate immune response in human macrophages, for improving the cell viability and reducing the number of germinated intracellular spores of anthrax [18] .",

Although no consensus could be made on the structure-activity relationship [19] , the (1Y3)-h-glycosidic linkage has been described as an explicit requirement for biological activity [20] . However, Bao et al. [21] recently reported the isolation, characterization as well as in vitro and in vivo lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production by a branched (1Y3)-a-dglucan. Water solubility and lower degree of branching were found to be desirable requirements for biological activity based on the immunological properties of its derivatives. This observation along with the immunological properties of a-(2Y8) linked sialic acid as well as that of heteropolysaccharides having a conformations in the main chain [22, 23] dispute the explicit requirement of (1Y3)-h-glycosidic linkage for the biological activity. In this paper, we describe a novel polysaccharide (RR1), an a-glucan, exhibiting unique immune boosting properties. RR1 is isolated from a medicinal herb, Tinospora cordifolia (family Minispermaceae), well known in the Indian Ayurvedic System of Medicine for antiinflammatory, antiallergic, antiarthritic, antioxidant and immune stimulating properties [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

The aerial part of the plant was air dried and powdered for RR1 extraction. The procedure adapted for the isolation is illustrated in the flow chart (Fig. 1) . The final compound RR1 was isolated in about 0.1% yield of the total dry material used for extraction as a puffy solid that dissolved in water. The initial analysis of the final product in our laboratory and the 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed that it is a polysaccharide. Therefore, detailed polysaccharide analyses such as the glycosyl composition, linkage, molecular weight and conformation of the glucose units at the anomeric center were performed at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The glycosyl composition analysis was done by the combined Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) of the per-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glucosides obtained from RR1 by acidic methanolysis according to the method of York et al. [29] . Inositol was used as internal standard in this analysis. The monosaccharide derivatives were identified by their characteristic retention time and further authenticated with their mass spectra. To perform glycosyl linkage analysis, the sample was permethylated thrice by the method of Ciucanu and Kerek [30] , hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, reduced with NaBD 4 and acetylated with acetic anhydride/ pyridine and the resulted partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAA) were analyzed by GC/ MS. The sugar residues were identified by their characteristic retention times and mass spectral data. The conformations at the anomeric center of the glucopyranosyl units were obtained based on the 500-MHz proton NMR spectra recorded in D 2 O and by comparison with the anomeric proton signals of standard samples. The molecular mass was obtained from the size exclusion chromatography using Supelco silica column (1.0\u00c230 cm), eluting with 50 mM ammonium formate buffer at a rate of 0.5 ml/min and detected by the refractive index. Dextran samples were used as standards and the molecular mass was obtained by comparing the retention time of the eluted peak with the standards.",

On the other hand, the very weak signal at d 4.66 ppm may be due to that of the h anomer. However, the ratio of the signals of a-d-glucose to h-d-glucose is about 99.9:1, and hence almost all glucose units appeared to be in the a configuration. Therefore, RR1 is an a-dglucan with (1Y4) linked glucopyranosyl units in the main chain with (1Y6) linked glucopyranosyl unit branches and a 0.15 degree of branching (Fig. 3) . In the size exclusion chromatography RR1 eluted as single peak at 12.32 min which was very close to the peak for the 511-kDa dextran sample (retention time 12.72 min). Therefore, RR1 is assigned a molecular weight N550 kDa.",

Furthermore, it is reported to exhibit antitumor effects by enhancing tumor specific immunity, presumably in a T-cell-dependent manner [42] . Our observations indicate that RR1 induces the production of this cytokine significantly at 10 Ag/ml. The significant synthesis of TNF-a by RR1 stimulation can play a critical role in host resistance to infections and to the growth of malignancy. TNF-a and its receptors are essential for protection against tuberculosis and for NO synthesis in macrophages early in infection [43] . RR1-induced IFN-g production may function in part to promote the activity of the components of the cell-mediated immune system such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), macrophages and NK cells in addition to its inhibitory role in Th2 response. It stimulates the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells and, therefore, boosts the innate immune response [5] . Moreover, it may modulate MCP-1 synthesis in macrophages by LPS [44] . CD4+ T cells contribute to the regulation of antigen specific (adaptive) immune system through the recognition of antigens and consequent production of cytokines. The distinct pattern of cytokine production by CD4+ cells form a dichotomy, Type 1 (Th1) characterized by IFN-g production and promotes elimination of intracellular pathogens and Type 2 (Th2) characterized by IL-4 production, involves IgE and eosinophils suitable for elimination of extra cellular pathogens. Cytokines act directly on T cells during primary activation and appears to be the most direct mediator among the factors influencing the terminal differentiation. The presence of IL-12 leads to Th1 response while IL-4 leads to Th2 development and the two pathways express mutually suppressive effect as well. IL-1 is identified as an inducer of IL-12 [41] while IL-18 is an early response in the development of Th1 cells by induction of IFN-g. The cytokine profile, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-g together with IL-1 by RR1 stimulation and the dose-dependent synthesis of these cytokines clearly demonstrate the Th1 pathway which is essential for cellular immunity and killing of intracellular pathogens and malignant cells. This observation is in conformity with IL-12 induced IFN-g-dependent T cell development to Th1 and CD8+ cytotoxic effector cells [45] [46] [47] . Concurrent signaling as well as synergistic action by IL-12 and IL-18 induces prolonged IFN-g production and the continuous strong expression of IL-18R mRNA in T cells [46] . The early inflammatory events, such as T cell adhesion to inflammatory sites, were also reported for IL-12 and IL-18 [48] . The higher level of the synthesis of the regulatory isoform IL-12 p40 may be a natural mechanism to contain the excessive production of Th1 response. Fig. 8 . Synthesis of cytokines and chemokine in RR1-induced normal lymphocytes. Normal lymphocytes from healthy volunteers were treated with RR1 (0-100 Ag) at 37 8C for 24 in a CO 2 incubator in RPMI medium.

RR1 induced the synthesis of IL-1h, IL-6, IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70, and IL-18, TNF-a, IFN-g, and MCP-1 significantly (***pb0.001).",

NO is reported to play an important role in the modulation of T helper cell differentiation and polarization. Yamasaki et al. [49] and Taylor-Robinson et al. [50] reported an inhibitory role of NO on Th1 cytokines while Bauer et al. [51] reported the same for Th1 as well as Th2 cytokines by NO from activated T cells. The low level of NO synthesis by RR1 does not appear to exert any inhibition of Th1 pathway. IFN-a, IFN-g and TNF-a are known upregulators of NO synthesis [52, 53] . As RR1 stimulation resulted in the synthesis of IFN-g and TNF-a and very little IFN-a, it is reasonable to assume that IFN-a priming may be a necessary step for triggering the production of higher levels of NO by polysaccharides [54] .",

In addition, we could not observe any significant elevation in the amount of hydrogen peroxide in our investigations (data not shown). In this context, the low level of NO synthesis by RR1 suggests an immune mediatory role for NO. The noncytotoxic nature of RR1, even at fairly high concentrations (1000 Ag/ml), may be attributed to the low level production of NO together with the ability of this polysaccharide not to induce oxidative stress in the cells.",

This observation is analogous with several reports on complement activation by other polysaccharides. C3a and C4a are bioactive cleavage products released from plasma components C3 and C4 during complement activation cascade in alternative and classical pathways [55] which are quickly converted to less active C3a des Arg and C4a des Arg forms and are involved in the mediation of cellular immune responses . The alternative pathway is self-amplifying and is impor-tant in the clearance and recognition of pathogens in the absence of antibodies [56] . h-Glucans are reported to activate the alternative pathway and the host mediated antitumor activity exhibited by these polymers were correlated with the activation of the complement system [57] . Lipopolysaccharides activate the complement system via alternative as well as classical pathways; the lipid part activates the classical pathway while the polysaccharide moiety activates the alternative pathway [58] .",

RR1 is a branched a-d-glucan structurally distinct from amylopectin and pullalan as no immune stimulation is reported by either amylopectin or pullalan. The similarity of its structure to the conserved molecular pattern of the cell wall components of fungal hglucans may be the reason for the activation of immune system. On the other hand, the differences, the a conformation and the (1Y4) linkages, may account for the non-induction of iNOS [49] and the consequent noncytotoxicity and the absence of oxidative stress. This water soluble neutral a-glucan has molecular mass and branching sequence well within the range of the polysaccharides exhibiting significant immune stimulating properties [11, 12, 19, 21] . The water solubility can overcome the granuloma formations exhibited by particulate h-glucans while the high molecular mass, being in the most potent range, may enable it to be retained by the host's organs for longer period without degradation [60, 61] . While the noncytotoxic nature, the significant activation of the lymphocytes, especially the NK cells and the alternate pathway of complement activation demonstrate the stimulation of the innate immune system, the cytokine profile resulting from the activation proclaims the stimulation of the antigen specific cell mediated (adaptive) immunity (Th1 pathway) with a selfregulating mechanism of its overrun. The absence of IL-4 synthesis (Th1 suppressor cytokine) and IL-10 (the inhibitor of IL-12) on stimulation with RR1 is in good agreement with the Th1 pathway of T cell differentiation. The IFN-g production by the concurrent signaling of IL-12 and IL-18 may serve as a potent anti anthrax agent, devoid of side effects, if any, of the exogenous IFN treatment as well. A stimulated innate immune system can fight the entry of any pathogens into the host and has the capacity to prevent primary infections from actually causing disease [62] . The unique immune stimulating properties of RR1 without exerting oxidative stress and any direct cytotoxic effect, thus far described, may make it a potent biodefense agent against a number of pathogens and human malignancies.",
