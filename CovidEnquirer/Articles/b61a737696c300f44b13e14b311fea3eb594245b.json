Four clones from the 3' end of the genome were sequenced either completely or in part to determine the sequence of the first 2451 bases. Within this sequence were identified, in order, a 3'-noncoding region of 291 bases, the gene for a 449-amino acid nucleocapsid protein (N) having a molecular weight of 49,379, and the gene for a 230-amino acid matrix protein (M) having a molecular weight of 26,376. A third large open reading frame is contained entirely within the N gene sequence but is positioned in a different reading frame; it potentially encodes a polypeptide of 207 amino acids having a molecular weight of 23,057. A higher degree of amino acid sequence homology was found between the M proteins of BCV and MHV (87%) than between the N proteins (70%). For the M proteins of BCV and MHV, notable differences were found at the amino terminus, the most probable site of 0-glycosylation, where the sequence is N-Met-Ser-Ser-Val-Thr-Thr for BCV and N-Met-Ser-Ser-Thr-Thr for MHV. BCV apparently uses two of its six potential C-glycosylation sites. o 1987 Academic press, inc.",

Vaccines produced from cell culture-attenuated strains of virus have failed to be completely protective. Before attempting to develop vaccines by recombinant DNA that may have improved usefulness, it is imperative that the genes and gene products responsible for inducing protective immunity be thoroughly characterized. Toward this end, and for the purpose of determining the function of individual proteins in coronavirus replication, we have begun to clone and sequence the BCV genome.",

One striking dissimilarity between BCV and MHV, however, is the possession by BCV of a fourth major structural protein, the 140-kDa hemagglutinin protein that comprises two disulfide-linked subunits of 65 kDa (Hogue et al., 1984; King and Brian, 1982; King et a/., 1985) .

This protein has extensive amino acid homology with the M protein of MHV A59 strain (Armstrong et a/., 1984) as expected from its close antigenic relatedness (Hogue et a/., 1984) and is therefore the apparent BCV counterpart (Fig. 4) . By maximum alignment of the proteins, 200 of the amino acids (>86%) are the same as 200 of the 228 in the MHV sequence, and another 16 (7%) represent conservative changes. Because of the strong similarity in structure between the BCV and MHV M proteins, the BCV M protein can be expected to have a similar topology with respect to the virion envelope (Rottier et a/., 1986). Namely, the central portion of the molecule would be expected to span the membrane three times, with approximately 28 amino acids (26 for MHV) at the amino terminus being external to the virion and approximately 100 amino acids at the carboxy terminus being internal to the virion. The protein is slightly basic, having a net charge of +9 at neutral pH. The basic amino acids are clustered in the carboxy terminal 40% of the protein. Within the carboxy terminal 100 amino acids are 14 of the 20 basic amino acids and 6 of the 14 acidic amino acids, giving this region of the molecule a net charge of f8. It is therefore reasonable to expect that this part of the molecule might be interacting with the negatively charged RNA as suggested (Sturman et al., 1980) or possibly with an acidic portion of the N protein to contribute to a direct interaction between the M and N molecules. We predict the latter occurs on the basis of a 1 :l molar ratio between the M and N proteins in BCV (King and Brian, 1982) . One hundred thirteen (49%) of the amino acids are hydrophobic and the distribution of hydrophobic amino acids is nearly identical to that for the MHV M protein.",

            "text": "The M proteins of BCV and MHV were together the first viral glycoproteins shown to possess O-linked oli-gosaccharides (Holmes et a/., 1981; Niemann and Klenk, 1981) . The character of the oligosaccharides, however, has been described only for MHV A59 . Our data suggest there may be up to two O-linked oligosaccharides per BCV M molecule. First, three separate species of M (gp26) molecules were identified from purified BCV when radiolabeled proteins were resolved by electrophoresis (Fig. 5 ). These were also observed, but less clearly resolved, when identified by immunoblotting with M-specific polyvalent antiserum (Fig. 5) or with M-specific monoclonal antiserum (data not shown). They have apparent molecular weights of 22K, 24K, and 26K and their appearance is consistent with the notion that the 22K species is the unglycosylated precursor and 1 or 2 oligosaccharide chains, each contributing approximately 2 kDa toward the molecular weight (Klenk and Rott, 1981) are added to assemble a 24-and 26-kDa species, respectively. Second, only three species of M protein were resolved in lysates of infected cells by immunoblotting and neither their sizes nor relative amounts were altered by tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation but not 0-glycosylation. Tunicamycin does, however, inhibit the glycosylation of gpl90 (the peplomeric protein for which the virion-associated subunits are gpl20 and gp100) and gp140 (the hemagglutinn) (Hogue and Brian, in preparation) . In the presence of radiolabeled glucosamine only the 24-and 26-kDa species were labeled (Fig. 5) . The fact that monensin, an inhibitor of Golgi function and hence O-glycosylation, diminishes the amount of the 24-and 26-kDa species and enhances the relative abundance of the 22-kDa species strengthens the notion the M glycosylation is O-linked (Niemann et a/., 1982) .",

The hydrophobic amino acids are spread somewhat evenly throughout the protein except at the carboxyl terminus, where there are enough to make this part of the protein a potential membrane anchor region. Twenty-seven of the terminal 41 amino acids (66%) are hydrophobic.

            "text": "We present the first nucleotide sequence data available for BCV or for any member of the hemagglutinating mammalian coronavirus subgroup which includes the human respiratory coronavirus OC43 and the porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus. Despite the fact that BCV has the hemagglutinin structural protein that is missing on MHV A59 (Hogue et a/., 1984; King et a/., 1985) it shares membership with MHV in one of the four major antigenic subgroups of coronaviruses (Pedersen et a/., 1978) . Both the gene map and the primary sequence for that part of the BCV genome described in this paper reflect a close relatedness to MHV, consistent with patterns of shared antigenicity between the two viruses (Hogue et a/., 1984) . Genome sequence divergence with regard to the hemagglutinin gene must therefore lie 5'-ward of this sequence. Both gene arrangement and primary sequence at the 3' end of the genome, however, suggest a greater degree of evolutionary divergence from both the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and avian infectious (Kapke and Brian, 1986) ; IBV has two open reading reading frame for a potential 9.1 K protein positioned frames for proteins of 7.5K and 9.5K positioned bebetween the 3'-noncoding sequence and the N gene tween the N and M genes . The N protein of BCV shows an overall amino acid sequence homology of 709/o with both MHV A59 and MHV JHM (72% at the nucleotide level) (Skinner and Siddell, 1983; Armstrong et a/., 1983) but only 29% (37% at the nucleotide level) with the N protein of TGEV (Kapke and Brian, 1986 ) and 29% (43% at the nucleotide level) with the N protein of IBV (Boursnell et a/., 1985) . The degree of homology between the N amino acid sequences of BCV and MHV is not evenly distributed throughout the gene, however. There are regions of up to 16 amino acid stretches, for example, that show less than 309/o homology. Conversely there are regions of up to 69-amino acid stretches showing greater than 90% homology. A region of high homology among MHV (beginning at amino acid 86) IBV (beginning at amino acid 53) and TGEV (beginning at amino acid 53), and extending for 68 positions (Kapke and Brian, 1986) is also found in BCV (beginning at amino acid 83). Within this region there is 79% perfect homology between BCV and MHV. Such regions of conservation suggest that there are evolutionary pressures for retention of a specific function associated with this sequence. Other regions having similar chemical properties but little primary sequence homology also suggest conserved functional domains. These include clusters of serine residues and clusters of basic and acidic amino acids. Assuming all coronavirus N proteins are phosphorylated at only serine residues, as in the N protein of MHV (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) then \"hot spots\" for potential phosphorylation become apparent when the N protein sequences are compared (Fig. 6) . By aligning the N proteins of MHV, BCV, IBV, and TGEV with the first amino acid of the conserved 68 amino acid region, three clusters of 3-l 2 serine residues in common among all viruses become apparent at BCV amino acid positions 40-70, 180-225, and 300-350. The major serine cluster region is at amino acid positions 180-225. Cluster groups of 5 to 26 basic amino acids can be seen within 50 residues of the amino terminus, within the 68-amino-acid conserved region, between amino acid positions 200 and 300, and in a region extending between amino acids 50 and 25 from the carboxy terminus, but not within six positions of the carboxy terminus (Fig. 6) . Clustering of acidic amino acids is less striking but clusters of 10 to 12 are observed within the last 100 bases of the carboxy terminus (Fig. 6 ). Such regions may indicate sites for protein-nucleic acid or protein-protein interactions. The high degree of amino acid sequence homology between the M proteins of BCV and MHV (86%) contrasts with the lower degree (70%) between the N proteins. The contrast becomes even more striking when amino acids of conserved nature are included, making the homology 93 and 79%, respectively, for the M and N proteins. This contrast indicates either that structural constraints on the M protein are more rigid, resulting in a more limited evolution of this protein, or that there is a form of genetic exchange that has taken place between the two viruses. The notion that the M protein may be structurally constrained as a result of functional requirements is suggested by the conserved chemical features between the MHV and IBV M proteins in the absence of conserved primary structure. IBV is antigenitally unrelated to MHV, and the IBV M protein shares an amino acid sequence homology of only 359/o (perfect match only using the same method of alignment employed above) with that of MHV. Yet it shows an extremely similar hydrophobicity profile and thus an apparently similar membrane topology . That is, amino acid changes were conservative. The notion of genetic exchanges, similar to those observed for RNA viruses with segmented genomes, must be seriously considered in light of recent evidence that coronaviruses undergo high-frequency recombination (Makino et a/., 1986) . The mechanism giving rise to coronavirus recombinants is unknown but may involve displacement of nascent RNA polymerase complexes from the negative-strand template of one parent with subsequent attachment to the negative strand of a second parent (Makino et al., 1986) . Recombination might therefore be expected between the closely related BCV and MHV viruses if, by chance, they should replicate simultaneously in the same host. This most certainly would be expected if polymerase binding during the recombinational event involves the conserved intergenic sequences used to identify initiation sites for transcription (Baric et a/., 1985; Budzilowicz eta/., 1985; Makino et al., 1986) .",

Within the virus complementary-sense RNA, two open reading frames of greater than 250 bases exist, beginning at approximate nucleotide positions 1220 and 1880 in the first reading frame. The significance of these is unknown. The largest open reading frame predicts a protein having properties of the nucleocapsid protein",
