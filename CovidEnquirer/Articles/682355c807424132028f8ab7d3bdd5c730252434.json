The.pattern of JHM-specific RNA varied with individual infections of Wistar Furth rats. However, two species of JHM-specific RNA, the nucleocapsid and a '2.1-2.4 X 106-Da RNA species were generally present. A general decrease in JHM-specific RNA in brains and spinal cord samples taken later than 20 days postinoculation was observed; however, JHM-specific RNA persisted in the spinal cord longer than in the brain of these rats.",

Specifically, Wistar Furth rats, injected ic at 10 days of age, generally developed hind leg paralysis or paresis with white matter involvement (Sorensen et aL, 1980) . There are many similarities between Wistar Furth rats with JHM-induced hind leg paralysis and MS in humans. Both diseases are characterized by a demyelination with destruction of glial cells and a relative sparing of axons (see review by Andrews, 1972; Oppenheimer, 1976; Sorensen et d, 1980) . In addition, JHM infection of the CNS of rats and MS in humans is characterized by periods of active demyelination followed by remission (Andrews, 1972; Rose, 1972; Sorensen et &, 1980) . Some degree of remyelination can be observed in MS patients (Andrews, 1972) . The suggestion of remyelination has also been observed in JHM-infected rats (Sorensen et &, 1980) . In addition, the distribution of the demyelinating lesions is ' Author to whom requests for reprints should be addressed.",

Lesions seen in the brain and spinal cord were similar to those previously described (Sorensen et ak, 1980) . In those rats which survived for longer than 3 weeks postinoculation (pi), lesions were often more extensive in the white matter including optic nerve, cerebrum, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and spinal cord (Table 1) . Changes in the white matter were characterized by vacuolation, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia of astroglial cells, and minimal to moderate mononuclear cell infiltration. Lesions were focal to segmental in nature. Hypertrophy of endothelial cells and perivascular cuffing with mononuclear cells were common findings. In severely affected areas, there was partial to complete obliteration of the normal architecture by the destructive inflammatory process. Gray matter lesions were characterized by destruction of neurons and astroglial cells, proliferation of endothelial cells lining capillaries, and mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrations. Using RNA transfer analysis, we examined the JHM-specific RNA sequences in these JHM-inoculated Wistar Furth rats. Our data revealed heterogeneity in the JHM-specific RNA species that were present in individual rats. Some RNA samples from inoculated rats had relatively few virus-specific RNA species (Fig.  1, lanes 3-5) . However, all 10 examined spinal cord and brain samples from 5and lo-day-old inoculated rats contained the 0.8 X lo6 Da JHM nucleocapsid mRNA species; in addition, all five spinal cord and four out of five brain samples contained a major RNA species of approximately 2.1-2.4 X lo6 Da (RNA species \"a\" in Figs. 1 and 2). This 2.1-2.4 X 106-Da species is of particular interest since it is not visible as a major viral RNA species in JHM-infected L-2 cells but was present as a dominant, somewhat heterogeneous JHM RNA species in the inoculated rats ( Figs. 1 and 2) . This RNA species did not appear to be a nonspecific breakdown product of higher-molecular-weight RNA since it was reproducibly present as a major species of viral RNA even though ethidium bromide staining indicated that the 18 and 28 S RNA were present as undegraded, discrete species (Fig. 3) . In addition the 2.1-2.4 X 106-Da species was present whether or not the JHM-specific 3 X lo6 Da and genomic RNAs were present as major discrete species (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, many brain and spinal cord samples from inoculated rats also contained other viral-specific RNA species which were not detected as major viral RNA species in JHM-infected L-2 cells ( Figs. 1 and 2) .",

However, there was generally less JHM-specific RNA in brains and spinal cords in rats sacrificed after 20 days pi than in rats killed before 20 days pi (Tables 2 and 3 ). In addition, rats inoculated at 10 days of age and killed after 20 days pi had more JHM-specific RNA per unit weight of sample remaining in their spinal cords than in their brains (Table 3) . DISCUSSION We detected variation in JHM-specific RNA that was present in the brains and spinal cords of Wistar Furth rats which were inoculated ic with JHM at 5-10 days of age. We detected 1-8 JHM-specific RNA species in these Wistar Furth rats (Figs. 1 and 2). All samples with detectable JHM-specific RNA contained the 0.8 X 106-Da JHM nucleocapsid mRNA species; in addition a 2.1-2.4 X 106-Da JHM RNA species was detected in all the spinal cord samples tested and all but one of the brain samples ( Figs. 1 and 2) . The 2.1-2.4 X 106-Da RNA species is of interest since it was consistently present in infected Wistar Furth rats as a major viral RNA species but not in JHM-infected L-2 cells. However, this species may be visible as a minor species in in vitro JHM infections (Cheley et al, 1981a, b) . Two possible sources of this RNA species are (1) the result of a specific processing of a highermolecular-weight RNA species; (2) the premature termination in the synthesis of the viral E2 glycoprotein mRNA. What role, if any, this viral RNA species plays in the demyelination process remains to be determined.",

One possible explanation for these results would be that infection of different cells in the brain and spinal cord with JHM virus produces different patterns of JHM-specific RNA species. Thus the observed patterns of JHM-specific RNA seen in different brain and spinal cord samples could vary depending on which cells are predominately infected for a given animal. Dubois-Dalcq et al. (1982) have reported that JHM can infect both neuronal and nonneuronal cells in C57BL mouse spinal cord cultures and that neuronal cells produce the E2 glycoprotein while infected nonneuronal cells do not. Another explanation for the variation in the viral RNA patterns, which is not mutually exclusively of the first possibility, would be due to selection of viral mutants. Lai et al. (1983) has reported that JHM virus isolated from persistently infected neuroblastoma cell lines diverged more markedly than the corresponding virus maintained under the conditions of lytic infection.",

After 20 days pi we could no longer detect virus-specific RNA using this technique. Hybridization kinetic analysis showed that JHM-specific RNA was still detectable in a spinal cord sample taken at 28 days pi (Table 3 ). In addition, our data indicated that infected brain or spinal cord samples contain only a small fraction (approximately 0.0005-0.003%) of the amount of JHM-specific RNA per unit weight of sample present in in vitro infected cells (Table 3 ). This result suggested that a relatively small percentage of cells in the spinal cord or brain are infected with the virus. This result is consistent with ultrastructural studies that demonstrated JHM particles only in oligodendrocytes of individual Wistar Furth rats killed at 12-24 days pi (Sorensen et al, 1980) . Furthermore, in immunofluorescence studies on JHM-inoculated rats with subacute demyelinating encephalitis, JHM antigen was detected in glial cells of the white matter in the cerebrum and spinal cord but not in neurons (Nagashima et a& 1978) . In Wistar Furth rats inoculated ic at 10 days and sacrificed after more than 20 days pi we could detect JHMspecific RNA by hybridization kinetics in the spinal cord but not in the brain. Thus, the viral RNA persisted longer in the spinal cord than in brain samples in these rats; this result suggests that an active viral infection is taking place in the spinal cord after the infection of the brain has ceased or is severely curtailed.",
