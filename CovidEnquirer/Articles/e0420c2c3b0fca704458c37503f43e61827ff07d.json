The result of recombination is a novel genetic entity that carries genetic information in nonparental combinations. Biochemically, recombination is a process of combining or substituting portions of nucleic acid molecules. Recombination has been recognized as an important process leading to genetic diversity of viral genomes upon which natural selection can function. Depending on the category of viruses, recombination can occur at the RNA or DNA levels. Since these processes are different for DNA and RNA viruses, they are described separately.",

In single-component DNA viruses recombination occurs by exchanging DNA fragments, whereas in segmented DNA viruses, additional events rely on reassortment of the entire genome segments. This complicates the recombination behavior observed among mutants. One method of recombination analysis utilizes so-called conditional-lethal types, where the cells are infected with two variants and the recombinants are selected after application of nonpermissive conditions (two-factor crosses). This allows the mutants to be organized into complementation groups with the relative positions of mutations being placed on a linear map. Another method is called three-factor crosses. Here three mutations are employed, with crossing-over occurring between two mutations while the third mutation is not selected. This allows for determination of linkage relationships among mutants and of the order of marker mutations. Due to reassortment, both the two-factor and the threefactor crosses are of less use in segmented DNA viruses.",

For instance, herpes simplex virus (HSV) was found to support recombination while using pairs of temperature-sensitive mutants (two-factor crossings). In fact, a recombination-dependent mechanism of HSV-1 DNA replication has been described. The recombination frequency was proportional to the distance between mutations which suggested the lack of specific signal sequences responsible for the crossing-over. By using three-factor crossing, the HSV system involved two ts mutants and a syncytial plaque morphology as an unselectable marker. Similarly, in case of adenoviruses, the host range determined by the helper function of two mutations has been used as a third marker between ts mutants. Here, intertypic crosses between ts mutants have been identified based on segregation patterns and the restriction enzyme polymorphism. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the family Herpesviridae, and it carries a long double-stranded genomic DNA, that shows a high-degree variation among strains. These variations include single base changes, restriction site polymorphism, insertions, or deletions. Based on tracking these mutations, it was found that some EBV strains arose due to DNA recombination.",

The geminiviruses carry a single-stranded DNA genome, composed of either one or two circular DNA molecules. Frequent intermolecular crossing-over events were observed by using mutant combinations. Homologous crossovers were detected to occur intramolecularly between tandem repeats of a geminivirus DNA using agro-infected tobacco plants. The mechanism may involve either homologous crossing-over events or copy-choice processes that rely on template switching by DNA replicase.

However, features such as recombinational hot spots and mismatch repair might indicate replicative (i.e., RNA) step, whereas mismatch repair can occur due to the formation of heteroduplex intermediates and thus suggest DNA recombination. These data further suggest that CaMV has the recombination mechanisms available at both steps of its life cycle.

This likely occurs during RNA replication by means of action of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme due to either replication errors or because of the replicase switching among viral RNA templates. The terms of classic population genetics do not describe RNA viruses. A better description of RNA viral populations is provided with a term 'quasispecies' that has been proposed to address a distribution of RNA variants in the infected tissue. Many of the RNA viruses limit their life cycle to cytoplasm and thus the observed recombination events among RNAs of plus-stranded RNA viruses must occur outside the nucleus. In general, the RNA crossing-over processes are categorized as being either homologous or nonhomologous, but some earlier authors proposed that there are homologous, aberrant homologous, and nonhomologous RNA recombination types. Aberrant homologous recombination involves crossovers between related RNAs, but the crosses occur at not-corresponding sites leading to sequences insertions or deletions. More recently, mechanistic models were utilized to define the following RNA-RNA recombination classes: (1) The 'similarity-essential' recombination, where substantial sequence similarity between the parental RNAs is required as the major RNA determinant; (2) The 'similaritynonessential' recombination does not require sequence similarity between the parental RNAs, although such regions may be present; and (3) There is the 'similarityassisted' recombination where sequence similarity can influence the frequency or the recombination sites but additional RNA determinants are also critical.",

This debilitated the replication of RNA such that the sequence got repaired by recombination with the sequences of other BMV RNA segments.

Further studies have shown that sgp-mediated crossing-over has occurred at the minus-strand level (i.e., during plus-strand synthesis), most likely by discontinuous process, where the replicase complex detached from one strand and reinitiated on another strand. This process is most likely primed by a sg RNA3a intermediate, which prematurely terminates on the polyU (in minus strand) tract and re-anneals to this region on another minus RNA3 template (Figure 3) .

The BMV RdRp enzyme complex (represented by gray ovals) migrates alongside the (\u00c0)-strand RNA template and pauses (represented by curved arrows) at the secondary structure or, most notably, at the oligoU tract, leading to the formation of subgenomic sgRNA3a. Yet another molecule of the RdRp enzyme binds to the sgp and initiates the de novo synthesis of sgRNA4. Also, the rehybridization of the sgRNA3a oligoA tail to the RNA3 (\u00c0) template can resume full-length copying which primes the observed RNA3-RNA3 recombination (5, 69). The (\u00fe) and (\u00c0) RNA strands are represented by thick lines and both the oligoU tract in the (\u00c0) strand template and the oligoA 3 0 termini are exposed.

Also, it was shown that the characteristics of homologous and nonhomologous crossovers could be modified separately by mutations at different protein sites. All these studies confirmed the involvement of replicase proteins in recombination and supported the template-switching model. More recently, the role of host factors in BMV recombination was addressed by using both yeast and Arabidopsis systems. In yeast, transient co-expression of two derivatives of BMV genomic RNA3 supported intermolecular homologous recombination at the RNA level but only when parental RNAs carried the cis-acting replication signals. The results implied that recombination occurred during RNA replication.

            "text": "A double-stranded RNA Pseudomonas phage Phi6 was hypothesized to recombine its RNA based on a copy-choice template switching mechanism, where the crossovers would have occurred inside the virus capsid structures at regions with almost no sequence similarity. Interestingly, the frequency of recombination was enhanced by conditions that prevented the minus-strand synthesis. Experiments were designed to reveal the effects of drift on existing genetic variation by minimizing the influence of variation on beneficial mutation rate. The segmented genome of the pseudomonas phage Phi6 has allowed to present the first empirical evidence that the advantage of sex during adaptation increases with the intensity of drift. The enterobacteria phage Qbeta, a small single-stranded RNA virus, could recombine both in vivo and in vitro. Here, the mechanism of recombination was not based on a template-switching by the replicase, but rather via a replicasemediated splicing-type religation of RNA fragments. The system produced nonhomologous recombinants, whereas the frequency of homologous crossovers was low. These data suggested an RNA trans-esterification reaction catalyzed by a conformation acquired by enterobacteria phage Qbeta replicase during RNA synthesis. In summary, the results on various plus-strand RNA virus systems demonstrate the availability of a variety of template-switch mechanisms, the mutual-primer-extension on two overlapping RNA strands, the primer-extension on one full-length RNA strand, as well as both replicative and nonreplicative trans-esterification mechanisms where a piece of another RNA is added to the 3 0 terminus of an RNA either by viral RdRp or by other enzymes (e.g., RNA ligase), respectively.",

The crossovers do occur by reverse transcriptase jumpings between the two genomic RNA molecules inside virion capsids. Apparently, the virally encoded reverse transcriptase enzymes have been evolutionarily selected to prone the jumpings between templates during reverse transcription. It turns out that the recombinant jumpings between RNA templates are responsible for both inter-and intramolecular template switchings and also for the formation of defective retroviral genomes. It has been found that the most stable interactions between two copies of retrovirus RNAs were within the 5 0 nucleotides 1-754. There is experimental evidence demonstrating that the template 'kissing' interactions effectively promote recombination within the HIV-I 5 0 untranslated region. The possibilities of recombination in retroviruses at the DNA level (of the integrated provirus sequences) were discussed earlier in this article.",

Those derived from the viral genomic RNAs and interfering with the helper virus accumulation or symptom formation are called as DI RNAs. First reports (in 1954) about DI RNAs coexisting with viral infection was provided by Paul von Magnus with influenza virus. Thereafter, numerous both animal and plant viruses were found to generate DI RNAs. Naturally occurring DI RNAs have been identified in coronavirus infections. These molecules appear to arise by a polymerase strand-switching mechanism. The leader sequence of the DI RNAs was found to switch to the helper-virus derived leader sequence, indicating that helper virus-derived leader was efficiently utilized during DI RNA synthesis. Also, the leader switching likely occurred during positive-strand DI RNA synthesis, and the helper-virus positive-strand RNA synthesis tended to recognize double-stranded RNA structures to produce positive-strand DI RNAs. The parts of the coronavirus RNA required for replication and packaging of the defective RNAs were investigated, with both the 5 0 -and the 3 0 -terminal sequences being necessary and sufficient. The coronavirus DI RNAs have been utilized to study the mechanism of site-specific RNA recombination. This process relies on the acquisition of a 5 0 leader that is normally used for production of numerous coronavirus sg RNAs. Also, these DI RNAs have been used as vehicles for the generation of designed recombinants from the parental coronavirus genome.",

            "text": "Genetic recombination is a common phenomenon among both DNA and RNA viruses. The recombination events have been observed based on natural rearrangements of the sequenced viral genomes. Also, experimental systems demonstrate the occurrence of recombination events that play important roles in securing the genetic diversity during viral infection. Different molecular mechanisms are involved in DNA versus RNA viruses. Many DNA viruses utilize host cellular machinery of general homologous recombination (such as meiotic crossing-over), whereas some encode their own proteins that are responsible for recombination. In addition, certain groups of DNA viruses support site-specific (nonhomologous) recombination events. In general, the virus DNA recombination mechanisms seem to involve post-DNA replication molecular events. For RNA viruses the majority of known homologous and nonhomologous RNA recombination events appear to be integrally linked to RNA replication machinery. Various types of copy-choice (template-switching) mechanisms were proposed to describe the easy formation of RNA recombinants in numerous RNA virus systems. The roles of both special RNA signal sequences and viral proteins have been elucidated, reflecting the variety of the recombination strategies used by RNA virus groups. The involvement of host cell genes in RNA virus recombination has begun to get elucidated in several RNA viruses. Besides replicational copy-choice mechanisms, some RNA viruses use the breakage-and-religation mechanism where viral RNA gets regenerated by religation from RNA fragments, as shown experimentally for Enterobacteria phage Qbeta. New venues of RNA recombination research just emerge including our better understanding of the involvement of RNA cis-acting signals, the role of RNA replication, and the importance of cellular host genes such as RNA ribonucleases or RNA interference.

The DNA complex cartoon for Enterobacteria phage l integrase (lower right) represents the new crystal structures. (b) Integration and excision by Enterobacteria phage l integrase. The first and second strand exchange cartoons represent the first and second halves of the recombination reaction, respectively. In the first half of integration, for example, Enterobacteria phage l integrase brings attP and attB sites together and exchanges the first pair of strands to generate a Holliday junction intermediate. In the second half of the reaction, the Holliday intermediate has isomerized to form a distinct quaternary structure and exchange of the second pair of strands generates recombinant attL and attR products.

The replicase/transcriptase can attenuate at one of the body TRSs in the 39-proximal part of the genome, after which the nascent minus strand extends with the anti-leader ('L') sequence. Next, the completed sg-length minus strands serve as templates for transcription. Reproduced fromPasternak AO, Spaan WJM, and Snijder EJ (2006) Nidovirus transcription: How to make sense...?

            "text": "(a) The outline of different species of genomic RNA and 59 and 39 terminal sgRNAs potentially produced in CTV-infected cells. The positive-sense RNAs are shown in blue and the negative-sense RNAs are shown in red. The wavy line represents the genomic RNA or the plus-sense transcript (blue) and the genomic length minus-sense RNA (red) produced from the plus-sense RNA. The solid green boxes on the genomic negative-stranded RNA represent the sgRNA controller elements. The solid lines represent the full array of plus-and minus-stranded genomic and 39-and 59-terminal sgRNAs potentially produced during replication of CTV. (b, c) Models predicting the generation of 59-and 39-terminal positive-and negative-sense sgRNAs with the controller element present in normal and reverse orientation. One control region is shown for clarity. The wavy blue line represents the transcript (blue) containing the control region (green box) in normal and reverse orientation (the direction of the arrowheads above the controller element indicates the orientation of the controller element). The thick curved arrows represent the transcription termination (vertical direction, red) or promotion(horizontal direction, yellow). The solid blue lines with arrowheads represent the positive-sense 39-and 59-terminal sgRNAs and the solid red line with arrowhead indicates the 39-terminal negative-sense sgRNA. The dashed lines with arrowheads indicate the potential 59 terminal positive (blue)-and negative (red)-sense sgRNAs. Reproduced from Gowda S, Satyanarayana T, Ayllon MA, et al.
