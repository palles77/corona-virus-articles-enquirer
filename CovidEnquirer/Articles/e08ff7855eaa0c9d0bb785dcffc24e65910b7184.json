We have reviewed the epidemiological and genetic analyses that have been published both during and since these epidemics, and show how quickly data were collected and analyses undertaken. Key factors that determine the speed and scale of transmission of an infectious disease were estimated using statistical and mathematical modelling approaches, and phylogenetic analyses provided insights into the origin and evolution of the SARS-associated coronavirus. The SARS literature continues to grow, and it is hoped that international collaboration in the analysis of epidemiological and contact-network databases will provide further insights into the spread of this newly emergent infectious disease.

Increasingly sophisticated techniques and more powerful computers now permit rigorous epidemiological and genetic analysis of epidemics as they unfold. The goals of such analyses include the following: understanding the origin of the disease with a view to preventing subsequent outbreaks; estimation of key biological and epidemiological parameters; identification of risk factors for susceptibility, infectiousness, and mortality; prediction of future trends in infection and case incidence; and assessment of the effectiveness of public-health control measures. Some of these goals can be achieved through the application of widely-used epidemiological methods, such as case-control studies, 13 which are applicable to a wide range of medical conditions. However, others require techniques specifically designed for the analysis of infectious diseases, 14 which, although less widely used, have a long history. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Here we review the epidemiological literature on SARS, as an example of an important novel infectious disease, and consider the contributions of the various approaches. In doing so, we highlight the benefits that were realised from epidemiological analyses and to suggest how, in future outbreaks, such methods might be used even more effectively.",

            "text": "Unprecedented levels of international cooperation led to the sequencing of two SARS viral genomes within 6 weeks of the identification of atypical pneumonia in Hong Kong. 20, 21 Alignment to the genomes of known groups 1, 2, and 3 coronaviruses showed that SARS coronavirus is phylogenetically distinct, and only distantly related to the other coronavirus clades. These early analyses showed that SARS coronavirus is not a recently evolved pathogen, and group 4 was proposed within which to classify the novel coronavirus. 20, 21 Subsequent alignment of the SARS coronavirus replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1b (about 5500 bp) genome segment, using the genus Torovirus (order Nidovirales) to root the tree, suggested that SARS coronavirus represents an early split-off from the coronavirus group 2 lineage 22 and should be thought of as a group 2 subgroup. This result has found support from other studies using alternative outgroups 23, 24 and methods. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] However, as clearly shown by analyses of other coronaviruses, 28, 29 single-stranded RNA viruses are prone to recombination within and between lineages. This greatly complicates phylogenetic analyses, as different regions of the genome will have different evolutionary histories. Marra and colleagues 20 proposed that SARS coronavirus may have undergone intergroup recombination after noting that the SARS coronavirus S2m motif is found in the group 3 avian coronaviruses, as well as the more distantly related equine rhinovirus (Picornaviridae). Later studies focused on the SARS coronavirus spike (S), matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N), replicase polyprotein (PP1ab), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) proteins with Bayesian techniques.",

However, the bootstrap methods used 24, 30 support an independent, and genetically distant, SARS coronavirus clade for all genes. This suggests that any recombination events, if they have occurred, are evidently ancient and therefore not implicated in the current emergence of SARS coronavirus in human populations.",

Suspicion focused on palm civet cats because 73% of the traders primarily trading in masked palm civet cats tested seropositive for the virus. 32 PCR and serological surveys of 25 animals from the liveanimal market found serological evidence for infection in five Himalayan palm civet cats, a raccoon dog, and a Chinese ferret-badger. Coronaviruses were successfully isolated from the palm civet cats and raccoon dog, yielding two full-length genomes with 99\u00b78% homology to human SARS coronavirus. 9 Further surveys of civet cats farmed in Hubei Province have shown that these too are infected with a SARS-like coronavirus. 31 Comparative analyses of the Shenzhen civet cat sequences against those from 11 human isolates showed that the human and animal isolates are phylogenetically distinct. 33 The genetic distance between civet cat coronavirus isolates is greater than that observed between geographically (China, Hong Kong, Canada) and temporally separated (early and mid-epidemic) human SARS coronavirus isolates. 9 These data suggest that SARS originated from an animal reservoir, and that the ultimate source of the coronavirus that caused the emergence of the human SARS coronavirus genotype remains unclear. However, sequence data from a recent case (GD03T0013, isolated Dec 16, 2003) has found closer grouping with the civet cat coronaviruses than was previously observed, 31 suggesting that civet cats may indeed be the source of SARS coronavirus. Further attempts to isolate the virus from market animals has met with little success. [34] [35] [36] Final confirmation of the animal reservoir of SARS coronavirus therefore awaits a systematic survey of Chinese fauna.",

Molecular analyses have shown that the early phase of the epidemic was characterised by two genotypes. The first (cluster A) is composed of 10 isolates corresponding to the very early cases from Guangdong Province and three separate introductions to Hong Kong. 33 The second (cluster B) corresponds to the so-called superspreading event (SSE) triggered by the arrival of patient 1 (HKU-33) in Hong Kong; 31, 33 this is the genotype that ultimately became pan-global.

Efforts to date the most recent common ancestor of SARS coronavirus have mostly followed the rationale that was used to date the emergence of HIV-1 M group viruses. 38 This relies on building a phylogenetic tree of isolates to find the most deeply branched sequences, then assuming neutral clock-like evolution to date the root of the tree. Using the divergence of S-gene sequences from 139 patients, 33 However, although promising, these studies necessarily rely on isolates that are collected over a short timescale and are probably rapidly evolving. Whereas contemporary isolates are rare, there have been recent infections that are not associated with laboratory escapes. 31 Due to the observation that the isolate GD03T0013 is the most deeply rooted yet seen, use of this sequence to date the most recent common ancestor of SARS coronavirus will push back the epidemic's origin, perhaps significantly. If done, such an analysis would suggest that SARS coronavirus has been circulating, undetected, in China for longer than was previously expected. It is also evident from comparisons of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks) in the S protein that the SARS genome is under strong directional selection. 31 The use of techniques that account for variation in the rates of evolution over the course of the epidemic (ie, Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees, BEAST v1\u00b70\u00b72, available from http://evolve.zoo.ox.ac.uk/ beast/ [accessed ) would therefore be appropriate.",

Furthermore, the average incubation period influences the timescale of the development of the epidemic, as it partly determines the time interval between a case and the infections that the case subsequently generates.

            "text": "Within the community, rates of transmission were generally low, with 8% of household contacts infected in one study in Hong Kong 71 and 6\u00b77% in a study in Singapore. 72 The closeness of contact also seems to be important. For example, in a large retrospective examination of case notes of quarantined close contacts of SARS cases in Beijing, China, the overall attack rate was 6\u00b73%, with the highest rates (15\u00b74%) in spouses and lowest rates in work and school contacts (0\u00b736%). 73 These figures are further supported by large-scale screening for SARS coronavirus antibodies in direct contacts of SARS cases, which have very low rates (0\u00b72% were positive for SARS coronavirus IgG antibodies 74 ). Nosocomial transmission therefore seems to have been the major source of new infections, with higher attack rates reported in this setting. For example, in a study of nosocomial outbreak in Toronto, rates in nurses working in the emergency department, ICU, and coronary care unit ranged from 10% to 60%. 52 Good barrier protection was essential to prevent transmission: in a case-control study in Hong Kong, inconsistent use of goggles, gowns, gloves, and caps was significantly associated with a higher risk of SARS. 75",

            "text": "Early in the epidemic, with little known about the pathogenicity of SARS, there was substantial concern about the increasing rates of morbidity and mortality that were being reported through individual case reports. Estimation of the case fatality rate (CFR; the percentage of people diagnosed as having a specific disease who die as a result of that disease) during an outbreak is complicated because the eventual outcomes of patients still in hospital are unknown at the time of analysis. The duration of hospital stay depended on the severity of illness, but for most patients this was in the region of 14 days to 1 month. 47, 76 Naive estimates of the CFR, based simply on the cumulative number of deaths divided by the cumulative number of cases, 77 were therefore particularly misleading because they yielded underestimates of the true mortality. This bias was reduced as the epidemic progressed (and as the outcome of a greater percentage of patients was known), which is why reported estimates of CFR seemed to indicate that mortality was increasing over time, causing some to incorrectly conclude that SARS coronavirus was evolving to be more lethal. 78, 79 The earliest estimates that used appropriate statistical methodology were published in May, 2003, with data from Hong Kong 47 and worldwide, 48 and gave final CFR estimates of between 14% and 18%. Table 2 shows the estimates obtained in various cohorts, with CFRs at 21 days after hospital admission of 6\u00b75% and 10%, at 28 days of 10%, and at 3 months of 12%. 46, [65] [66] [67] CFRs for those admitted to ICUs were significantly higher, with estimates at 28 days of 26% and 34% in Hong Kong and Toronto cohorts, respectively. 80, 82 Several cohorts have consistently described the course of disease for SARS patients, using these data to assess factors that contribute to an increased risk of an adverse outcome. The definition of adverse outcome varies, but generally includes death, admission to an ICU requiring mechanical ventilation, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Most studies identify older age as a factor that increases the probability of an adverse event. 45, [64] [65] [66] 68, 80, 82 The strong association between age and CFR is also clearly seen in national case reports, with CFR estimates in those aged over 60 years particularly high. 47 Furthermore, no deaths from SARS occurred in children, who had fewer complications and less severe symptoms. 83, 84 The presence of co-morbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also significantly increased the risk of adverse outcomes and death from SARS, 46, 64, 65, 80, 82, 85 and probably helps to explain the strong association between the CFR and age. Indeed, in some cohorts, deaths almost exclusively occurred in patients with other co-morbidities. 69, 85 Other notable factors contributing to higher CFRs were sex (with men at higher risk than women), 45,86 high lactate dehydrogenase concentration at presentation, 45, 66 and higher viral loads. 87 Most patients with SARS received some treatment that was based on previous experience with respiratory infections and evolved over the course of the epidemic. For this reason, most reports of the success of different treatments are observational and may be subject to treatment allocation bias. Common treatments included administration of antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids, 46, 64, 69, 82, 88, 89 with the HIV-1 antiviral drug lopinavir also tested later in the epidemic in Hong Kong. 90 In one study in Guangzhou, China, patients were randomly allocated to one of four treatment regimens, with the best response seen in the group receiving early high-dose steroids. 88 However, as was the case for the observational studies, the study was not fully randomised since this fourth group consisted of patients diagnosed later in calendar time than the other three groups.",

The expected number of cases on any given day is determined by the current size of the outbreak, the transmissibility of the disease, and the mixing behaviour of the population, with the infection process causing positive feedback, which results in highly non-linear trends in case incidence over time. Mathematical epidemic models 14 describe (with varying levels of realism) the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of disease progression in the infected individual and transmission in the population. They are therefore also known as mechanistic or dynamical models. It is now common practice for the continuing population-level risk from infectious disease to be assessed using such models.",

At the very start of an outbreak (t=0), the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is defined to be the average number of secondary cases caused by the index case in an entirely susceptible population. If R 0 is greater than 1, then an infectious disease outbreak has the potential to establish itself, resulting in an epidemic that will infect a substantial proportion of the population if there is no significant change in either the behaviour (ie, reduced mixing) or the susceptibility of the population (ie, through vaccination). If disease spread is not controlled, the number of new cases each day will not start to decline until the pool of susceptible people has been substantially depleted.",

Reducing R t to below 1 causes a rapid reduction in case incidence long before a significant proportion of the population has been affected. However, the relative ease with which an epidemic can be controlled is critically dependent on the magnitude of R 0 . 14 To control an epidemic with R 0 =10 through vaccination, 90% of the population need to be immunised, whereas if R 0 =2, the level of coverage required drops to 50%. Table 3 summarises the structure, fitting method, and results of modelling studies published during and after the SARS epidemic. R 0 values from between 1\u00b705 and 7\u00b77 have been estimated for SARS in different settings. 53, [92] [93] [94] [95] [97] [98] [99] SSEs (see below) are included in the model presented by Riley and colleagues, 92 but excluded from their R 0 estimate of 2\u00b71-3\u00b77 for SARS in Hong Kong. Wallinga and Teunis 99 used an elegant method based on individual cases to infer the most likely network of contacts between cases from partial exposure data and estimates of the generation time distribution. This method allows direct non-parametric estimation of the mean and distribution of R t through time. They calculated R t to be 3 before the WHO global alert on March 12, 2003 , and 0\u00b77 afterwards. Lipsitch and colleagues 93 give a much broader range of 1\u00b71-7\u00b77 for R 0 . These estimates were derived using two methods, one fitting exponential growth to three pre-selected timepoints for data from Hong Kong, Canada, and Singapore, and a second, more sophisticated approach, resembling that used by Wallinga and Teunis. 99 Overall, SARS can be classified as moderately transmissible, with smallpox being slightly more transmissible (R 0 =4-10) 100 and measles being much more transmissible (R 0 =7-45). 101 All the regional SARS outbreaks were controlled relatively quickly, implying that R t was rapidly brought below 1. However, the reason for this drop in R t is the subject of some debate. Riley and colleagues 92 showed that very little of the drop in R t can be attributed to changes in the speed with which people are admitted to hospital, and suggested that it was due to a general reduction in overall mixing in the community, coupled with improved infection control in hospitals. Lloyd-Smith and co-workers 102 use a relatively complex model of community and hospital transmission to show that it was improved infection control in hospital that contributed most to reductions in transmissibility.",

The examples of patient 1 in Hong Kong, who infected 10 people in the Metropole Hotel (known as Hotel M) and additional people after his admission to St Paul's Hospital, Hong Kong, 106 and the Amoy Gardens 107,108 cluster in Hong Kong are the best known, but patients who generated large numbers (>10) of secondary cases were also identified in Singapore (with at least five such patients 49 ) and Canada. 52 However, super-spreading individuals are not unique to SARS. Their existence has been well documented for tuberculosis, 109 measles, 110, 111 and smallpox, 112 and they are believed to have occurred in other diseases including Ebola 113 and the zoonotic transmission of monkeypox. 114 Furthermore, the importance of a small number of individuals with high rates of partner change is critical to the epidemiology of many sexually transmitted infections. 115, 116 There will, of course, be variability in the number of secondary cases from any primary case owing to random variation, even without any underlying variation due to characteristics of the primary case. However, if all cases have identical levels and durations of infectiousness with constant contact probabilities, such variation is expected to be Poisson. 117 Once variation in the duration of infectiousness period is allowed for, higher than Poisson variance is expected, with negative binomially distributed numbers of secondary cases expected for exponentially distributed infectiousness. 93, [117] [118] [119] However, key to the debate surrounding SSEs is whether such events are merely the extreme tail of a continuous distribution 93 or they represent a distinct separate class of cases. 92, 105 Although some of the SSEs (particularly those in Hong Kong) seem too extreme to have arisen from an underlying continuous distribution, it should be noted that estimating the frequency of SSEs from case data in a single region is subject to severe selection biases. This is because in Review SARS epidemiology and genetics *In their simplest form, such model structures divide individuals into three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R), with recovered individuals assumed to be immune to further infection; for this reason, such models are often called SIR models. Extensions of SIR models have included additional classes of individuals: exposed (E, also known as latent), hospitalised (H), quarantined (Q), and dead (D).",

Ideally, one would like to characterise the overall distribution of secondary case numbers for SARS before and after controls were introduced. To do this rigorously would require a global analysis, given the early importance of international spread. However, the detailed contact tracing data required for such an analysis does not exist in some areas, and are incomplete for others where large outbreaks were seen. Irrespective of whether SSEs are a discrete class of transmission events or the tail of a distribution, it cannot be assumed that variation in secondary case numbers is primarily due to biological variation in the amount of virus shed by patients and hence their infectiousness. Variation in contact rates with other individuals in the population is also likely to have been important, and may indeed have been the dominant factor explaining SSEs. Such variation might be in the frequency of direct contacts (eg, large numbers of medical personnel saw the index patient in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong 120 ) or indirect contacts (eg, unusual modes of viral spread in the Metropole Hotel and Amoy Gardens 107,108 ). Characterisation of heterogeneity in contact rates has been the topic of much research in infectious disease epidemiology, 14, 121, 122 and various modelling approaches (including stratified population models [123] [124] [125] [126] and individual-based network models 127 ) have been developed to incorporate such heterogeneity. Masuda and colleagues 105 use a network-based approach to model SARS, and concluded that SSEs are best explained by an increase in infectiousness in a few individuals, rather than extreme contact-rate heterogeneity. However, these conclusions are dependent on the investigators' simplifying assumptions about network structure. Overall, identifying the biological, social, or environmental causes for SSEs is important for the development of strategies for efficiently preventing or controlling such events, since the optimal choice of tactics to be employed will depend on the causative mechanisms.",

Greater understanding of within-ward transmission would be gained into risk factors associated with both infectiousness and susceptibility from detailed stochastic modelling of patient and healthcare worker contacts. This work could usefully build on published Markov chain Monte Carlo models of nosocomial transmission. 128 As well as giving greater insights into processes underlying the SARS epidemic, the models and estimation methods developed will strengthen the set of analytical tools available for the analysis of future epidemics. In each case, surveillance and data quality are fundamental to providing sound foundations to underpin analyses and conclusions. Contingency plans developed on the basis of the experience of the SARS epidemics have rightly placed a high priority on both surveillance and contact tracing. 129, 130 Epidemiological modelling has clarified the types of diseases that can be controlled with the straightforward public measures of isolation and contact tracing. 103 More detailed modelling will be required to further clarify the potential impact of further measures, including restrictions on both short-range and long-range movements of people. A review of recent smallpox modelling 131 cautioned that modelling efforts should not set the nearly impossible goal of identifying the best public-health strategy in advance of an epidemic, but should identify sets of recommended actions with associated decision rules for adaptive management as an epidemic unfolds.",
