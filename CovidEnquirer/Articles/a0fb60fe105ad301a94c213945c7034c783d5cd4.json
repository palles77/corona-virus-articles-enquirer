Even though influenza vaccination has been found to be the single most important measure for preventing hospital-acquired influenza, HCWs continue to have low vaccination rates. 2 In November 2000 the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services published a health promotion and disease prevention initiative, Healthy People 2010, establishing a goal of a 60% rate for influenza vaccination of HCWs by 2010. 3 Yet, the national vaccination rate for HCWs remains at unacceptably low levels: 38% in the 1999-2000 influenza season, 42% in 2005-2006, 44% in 2006-2007, and 49% in 2007-2008 . [4] [5] [6] [7] In 2006, in an attempt to address the failure to improve HCW vaccination rates, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations, which focused on three strategies: educating HCWs about benefits of vaccination; providing annual, free on-site vaccination; and obtaining signed declination forms for vaccine refusers. 8, 9 Also in 2006, The Joint Commission established a new infection control standard for influenza vaccination of HCWs that included education, on-site access to vaccination, and ongoing program evaluation to improve HCW participation. 9 -12 * Health care institutions have attempted to increase their immunization rates using a variety of methods: education, reminder notices, providing small incentives, establishing easy access to free vaccination, active promotion of vaccination within the workplace, and/or compulsory vaccination as a condition of employment.

The U.S. Healthy People 2010 initiative set a national goal of 60% coverage for HCW influenza vaccination by 2010. Yet vaccination rates remain low. In the 2008-2009 influenza season, Flushing Hospital Medi cal Center (FHMC; New York) adopted a \"push/pull\" point-ofdispensing (POD) vaccination model that was derived from emergency preparedness planning for mass vaccination and/or prophylaxis to respond to an infectious disease outbreak, whether occurring naturally or due to bioterrorism. Launch of the HCW Vaccination Program: In mid-September 2008, a two-week HCW vaccination program was launched using a sequential POD approach. In Push POD, teams assigned to specific patient units educated all HCWs about influenza vaccination and offered on-site vaccination; vaccinated HCWs received a 2009 identification (ID) validation sticker. In Pull POD, HCWs could enter the hospital only through one entrance; all other employee entrances were \"locked down.\" A 2009 ID validation sticker was required for entry and to punch in for duty. Employees without the new validation sticker were directed to a nearby vaccination team. After the Push/Pull POD was completed, the employee vaccination drive at FHMC was continued for the remainder of the influenza season by the Employee Health Service. Results: Using this model, in two days 72% of the employees were reached, with 54% of those reached accepting vaccination. Conclusions: This model provides a novel approach for institutions to improve their HCW influenza vaccination rates within a limited period through exercising emergency preparedness plans for infectious disease outbreaks.",

[16] [17] [18] At our institution, implementing some of these methods resulted in only modest gains in HCW vaccination rates, with an acceptance rate of only 38% in the 2006-2007 vaccination season. 19 As a result, we decided to employ an emergency preparedness model as the primary means for vaccinating our employees in the 2008-2009 season. 20 Interest in the ability to recognize and respond to a bioterrorism or naturally occurring event has intensified during the past years. Exercises have focused on problems that hospitals would face with respect to (1) leadership and decision making, (2) prioritization and distribution of antibiotics and vaccines, and (3) applying principles of disease containment, including facility lockdown. 21 Recent events, including the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in November 2002 to July 2003, concerns over avian influenza, and, most recently, pandemic H1N1 influenza, have prompted hospitals to reappraise their emergency preparedness plans. However, regular drilling of such plans to challenge their inherent assumptions is often lacking, giving rise to a false sense of security known as the \"paper plan syndrome.\" 22, 23 Modification of emergency preparedness plans through drills and exercises is required to render them more effective. 24 At our institution, the decision to link the HCW influenza vaccination program to exercising our emergency preparedness plan was viewed as an opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of both.",

The linkage of our Emergency Response Plan with improvement in HCW influenza vaccination rates is a unique approach that can enhance the effectiveness of both programs. Using components of our emergency preparedness plans, including the ICS model, we were able to reach 72% of hospital employees and vaccinate 39% of our total workforce in a two-day period, nearly achieving the national average for seasonal influenza vaccination of HCWs within that limited time frame. With respect to emergency preparedness planning, the initiative offered an opportunity to organize, execute, and evaluate performance for mass vaccination/prophylaxis in the context of a drill. During the Push phase, the incident manager of the ICS was able to monitor the deployment and success of vaccination teams in real A novel feature of our program was the facility lockdown in the Pull POD. Limiting access to the facility as well as restricting access to the device required to clock in for work only to those employees who had been issued ID validation stickers during the Push POD for either having received or declined influenza vaccine proved to be a successful method for identifying, reaching, and vaccinating additional HCWs.",

Although many HCWs declined vaccination in this Pull phase, vaccination declinations had to be signed to clock in for work. Future exercise planning would determine if additional or longer lock-down periods at different shift times can be implemented at our busy urban community hospital.

New York State had instituted mandatory influenza vaccination for HCWs, only to later suspend the mandate because of disruptions in vaccine supply for both seasonal influenza and mono-valent H1N1 vaccine. Some reluctant HCWs agreed to be vaccinated because of the original mandate, whereas others withheld their consent while awaiting results of legal challenges. There was also anxiety expressed by some HCWs over receiving two vaccinations. In particular, concerns over the \"newness\" of the H1N1 vaccine and recollections of problems associated with \"swine flu\" vaccine in 1976 might have had a crossover effect in creating or reinforcing negative perceptions about influenza vaccines in general.",

The plan was executed without altering staffing patterns and allowed for real patients to receive care without interruption. The exercise demonstrated the ability of our ICS to successfully deploy multidisciplinary teams and monitor their activities, to rapidly screen HCWs, to efficiently distribute vaccine, and to collect measurable data on performance to drive the process.",

We believe that this model can serve as a dual platform for other institutions to improve their HCW vaccination rates and emergency preparedness planning. The ability to reach and offer influenza vaccination to a majority of HCWs early in the influenza vaccination season, and to accomplish such vaccination efficiently, allows for targeted initiatives for those HCWs most resistant to vaccination. Future studies should explore different approaches to the Push/Pull model as it relates to duration, frequency, sequencing, or separating its components to create best practices that fit the needs of different institutions. Mandatory influenza vaccination of HCWs would clearly have the most significant impact on improving acceptance rates but would still not obviate the need to regularly exercise emergency preparedness plans in preparation for other potential infectious disease threats.",
