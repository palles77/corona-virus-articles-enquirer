The main barriers to preventive practices were low perceived benefi ts and interference with work. Poultry workers require occupationspecifi c health promotion. I n 1997, a zoonosis in humans caused by a highly lethal strain of avian infl uenza virus (H5N1) was reported in Hong Kong. Live-poultry markets were the source of this outbreak (1) . As one of the world's most densely populated regions (16,000 persons/mile 2 [>6,300 persons/km 2 ]) (2), Hong Kong is a city at high risk for a large-scale outbreak of avian infl uenza caused by live poultry in large-volume wholesale markets and within neighborhood wet markets (open food stall markets).",

However, occupational practices of animal workers might not be amenable to change solely on the basis of improvements in knowledge. Only 129 (42.1%) respondents reported that poultry workers could realistically adhere to all government guidelines (6) . Interference with work, high cost, and reduction of business were repeatedly cited as impediments to the adoption of preventive behavior. Even in the event of local outbreaks of avian infl uenza, most workers were not amenable to actions having adverse economic effects such as reducing work hours. Animal workers are thereby unlikely to widely adopt preventive behavior if these measures confl ict with their economic interests.",
