The 1918 epidemic in Singapore, which was then already a major global trading hub, occurred in 2 waves, June-July, and October-November, and resulted in >2,870 deaths. The excess mortality rate was higher than that for industrialized nations in the Northern Hemisphere but lower than that for less industrialized countries in Asia and Africa. The 1957 epidemic occurred in May and resulted in widespread illness. The 1968 epidemic occurred in August and lasted a few weeks, again with widespread illness. Tropical cities may be affected early in a pandemic and have higher mortality rates. With the increase in travel and trade, a future pandemic may reach a globally connected city early and spread worldwide. Preparedness and surveillance plans must be developed to include the megacities of the tropical world. I nfl uenza has had a substantial effect worldwide. The 3 infl uenza pandemics of the 20th century (1918-9, Spanish Flu; 1957-8, Asian Flu; and 1968, Hong Kong Flu) resulted in 40 million, 2 million, and 1 million deaths, respectively (1, 2) . Their social, cultural, and economic effect has been best described in North America and Western Europe (3) .",

This study aims to describe the effect of these pandemics on Singapore, a global trading city throughout the 20th century.

We have thus elected to use direct statistical analysis of data for the 2 years before and after the pandemic year to form a regression line with 95% confi dence intervals. Deaths for each month were then compared with the regression line. Months for which the mortality rate exceeded the 95% confi dence intervals were considered as those with ex-cess deaths, with the excess represented as the actual mortality rate minus the predicted mortality rate.",

This is in contrast to the immediate prepandemic and postpandemic years from 1915 to 1921, when mortality rates ranged from 29/1,000 to 37/1,000 population. The excess mortality rate within the Straits Settlements in 1918 was therefore 11.3/1,000 (9,435/827,719). Figure 1 shows that the excess mortality rate of the epidemic in Singapore alone, as calculated by our method, was 7.76 per 1,000 (2,870/369,800) during May-June and October-November 1918. Using the formula of Murray et al. (8) , we calculated the excess mortality rate for Singapore during the pandemic years of 1918-20 to be 1.80% (18/1,000, or 6,656 deaths).",

The outbreak was fi rst recognized at the end of April and early May and was purported to have spread through Hong Kong from its origins in northern Asia (19). By May 5, the outbreak had become an epidemic, reaching its peak in mid-May and tapering off by the end of the month (20). In May, 77,211 (47.6%) of 162,093 patients who came to government and city council clinics were treated for infl uenza; 326 required hospital admission, and 28 deaths from infl uenza were recorded (22 from pneumonia and 6 from cardiac complications) (20). On the basis of monthly mortality rate reports (Figure 2 ), an excess mortality rate of 0.47/1,000 occurred in May 1957. This represented 680 deaths in a population of 1,445,900. There was another small peak of excess deaths in October 1958, although this was only slightly above the baseline value. During the 1957 epidemic, the government focused on public health measures, including closure of schools for almost 2 weeks because of illness and absenteeism. The public was advised to keep away from crowded places (20), and the slogan \"no movement of persons -no spread of infl uenza\" was professed (21) . At healthcare facilities, elective surgery was minimized to release staff to manage the epidemic. School health clinics, maternal and child health clinics, and voluntary clinics were set up as infl uenza treatment centers (20). Although no port quarantine measures were required by law, the airport health offi cer checked outward-bound passengers for airlines upon request. Similarly, 1 shipping line screened all passengers boarding their ships, and those who failed screening were denied embarkation (20).",

However, Singapore, as a main trading city, was relatively more industrialized with a proportionately smaller rural population, and thus had lower mortality rates than did neighboring countries such as India and the Philippines (Table) . Even in Singapore, attack rates were lower for Europeans and Asians with higher socioeconomic sta- (19, 27) . Another possible explanation is that those who were more educated were also more receptive to public health messages, which reduced disease transmission. Using the formula of Murray et al. for the 1918-20 pandemic, we determined that the excess mortality rate for Singapore was higher than the global average rate. Because the Singapore epidemic occurred early in the global pandemic, this fi nding corroborates the suggestion that early epidemic centers experienced higher mortality rates (8) . This is also evident when one compares the mortality rates for tropical countries such as Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka) and Singapore with rates for tropical Caribbean islands (Table) . During the second wave of the pandemic in Spain in October 1918, Asian nations such as Ceylon and Singapore also reported similar epidemic recrudescence in early October (28) . By the end of the second wave of the pandemic in Singapore, there were still reports of infl uenza in Malaysia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Japan (9, 29) . This fi nding also suggests that nations are at high risk of acquiring early infection and could act as sentinels for the next pandemic.",

However, reported overall mortality rates of 43.85/1,000 in 1918 were comparable to \"46.46 per thousand in 1911, a very malarious year\" (10) . Deaths during the fi rst epidemic wave were initially attributed to malaria (30). The 1918 pandemic also had a variable effect in US possessions in tropical regions (3) . The early effect from the 1918 Singapore epidemic may not have been noticeable because of the nonseasonal nature of infl uenza in the tropics (4) or because of the high background mortality rates from infectious diseases and other causes in Singapore. Although excess deaths in 1918 were substantially higher than excess deaths in 1957, the relative change in mortality rates was similar; peak monthly mortality rates were twice baseline mortality rates for both periods (Figures 1, 2) . The 1918 baseline mortality rate was 4\u00d7 higher than the 1957 rate, and the decrease in the baseline mortality rate was largely due to improved socioeconomic conditions and control of infectious diseases such as malaria. With the low baseline mortality rate for modern cities, the effect of a pandemic, however mild, may be noticed (the Singapore media declared the 1957 pandemic as the worst). Although studies suggest that pandemic mortality rates will be higher for industrialized countries (8, 26) , if a pandemic were to fi rst appear in less industrialized regions with high baseline mortality rates, the pandemic might be missed or dismissed as yet another spike of endemic infectious diseases during the initial epidemic phase until deaths increased.",

In the recent World Health Organization recommendations for pandemic infl uenza, respiratory hygiene has been encouraged as a routine preventive measure (35) . Social distancing and disinfection may also be considered to reduce its effect, depending on severity and transmission of disease, to reduce its effect, although defi nitive evidence is lacking (35) . The effect of school closures remains unclear. Ferguson et al. suggested that closure of schools does not substantially reduce overall attack rates but does reduce peak attack rates (36) .

This fi nding suggests the possibility of late recognition. Delayed recognition must be considered even in this modern age. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic reached Singapore within weeks of its appearance in the southern part of the People's Republic of China but remained undetected. Two of the 20th-century infl uenza pandemics and the SARS epidemic are believed to have originated from farms in eastern Asia. SARS was fi rst detected in Foshan, quickly spread to Guangzhou City (a major regional trading hub), to Hong Kong, and then to the rest of the world. A global surveillance effort is therefore critical to enable prompt activation of pandemic plans. This effort should include frontline surveillance of farms in eastern Asia and secondary surveillance of major Asian cities.",
