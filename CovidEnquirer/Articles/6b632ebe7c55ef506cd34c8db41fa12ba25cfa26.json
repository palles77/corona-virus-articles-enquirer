Therefore it is imperative to identify novel targets that can be targeted for effective therapeutic intervention. We aimed to identify and validate interactions of VEEV nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) with host proteins and determine the consequences of these interactions to viral multiplication. We used a HA tagged nsP3 infectious clone (rTC-83-nsP3-HA) to identify and validate two RNA helicases: DDX1 and DDX3 that interacted with VEEV-nsP3. In addition, DDX1 and DDX3 knockdown resulted in a decrease in infectious viral titers. Furthermore, we propose a functional model where the nsP3:DDX3 complex interacts with the host translational machinery and is essential in the viral life cycle. This study will lead to future investigations in understanding the importance of VEEV-nsP3 to viral multiplication and apply the information for the discovery of novel host targets as therapeutic options.",

The structural proteins ultimately interact to form viral particles and the functions of the individual proteins are well understood (Atasheva et al., 2010a (Atasheva et al., , 2010b Foy et al., 2013a; Garmashova et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2011; Malygin et al., 2009; Parker et al., 2010; Snyder et al., 2013) . The non-structural proteins (nsPs) are primarily responsible for viral replication (Foy et al., 2013a; Jose et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2012; Weaver and Barrett, 2004) . We previously identified that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with the host kinase IKKb in infected cells and that this interaction was important for efficient viral multiplication (Amaya et al., 2014) . We Fig. 1 . Replication kinetics of rTC-83-nsP3-HA is not altered with introduction of a HA tag. A) Schematic representation of HA tag insertion in the rTC-83 background. Using the rTC-83 clone as a backbone and standard PCR recombination techniques, an HA tag was inserted at the C-terminus of nsP3 to allow for detection and isolation of nsP3-containing complexes. Briefly, the nsP3 region of rTC-83 was sub-cloned with primers containing a linker region (Ser-Ala-Ser-Ala) and an HA-tag was inserted at the C-terminal end of nsP3. The last residue of nsP3 was mutated from an alanine to a valine to prevent nsP2 cleavage of the tag. An initial stock of virus was prepared by electroporation of BHK-21 cells with rTC-83-nsP3-HA. U87MG cells seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate were infected with rTC-83 or rTC-83-nsP3-HA at MOI:1 (B) and 10 (C) for 1 h. Fresh media were added to the cells and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 36 hpi supernatants were collected and analyzed by plaque assay for infectious viral particles. U87MG cells seeded at hypothesized that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with a subset of host proteins in infected cells to form a VEEV-nsP3 interactome (molecular interactions of host proteins with VEEV-nsP3); such that knockdown of the identified host proteins will influence VEEV multiplication. We employed a mass spectrometry (MS) based approach from which RNA helicases, DDX1 and DDX3 were identified to interact with VEEV-nsP3 in infected cells. To assess the requirement for these interactions in the viral lifecycle, siRNA mediated depletion of DDX1 and DDX3 indicated a decrease in infectious viral titers. Therefore, our studies demonstrate a potential role for DDX1 and DDX3 in the VEEV life cycle. Collectively, these results will aid future studies of the role of VEEV-nsP3 in context of the viral life cycle.",

The replication kinetics of rTC-83 and rTC-83-nsP3-HA in U87MG cells at a low (MOI:1) and high (MOI:10) MOI were compared to determine if insertion of the tag significantly impaired viral replication. Relative titers of infectious virus analyzed by plaque assay indicated that at the low MOI a minor lag in the replication kinetics was observed (Fig. 1B left) but at the higher MOI the replication kinetics of the tagged virus was comparable to that of the wild type rTC-83 ( Fig. 1C left). Expression levels of the structural protein capsid (representative for viral protein expression) of rTC-83-nsP3-HA were comparable to that of rTC-83 ( Fig. 1B and C, right). We determined nsP3 protein expression by virtue of the HA tag in whole cell extracts at later time points at the higher MOI ( Fig. 1C , right, lanes 6 and 7). We next determined if insertion of the HA tag impacted intracellular viral RNA kinetics by q-RT-PCR using VEEV specific primers. Fig. 1D indicated that rTC-83-nsP3-HA replicated to high titers over the time course investigated in an MOI dependent manner when compared to rTC-83. Western blot analysis demonstrated that nsP3 could be immunoprecipitated by using the tag from infected cells at 6 hpi (Fig. 1E, lane 4) . We also validated the IKKb:nsP3 interaction that we had reported in our previous publication using a plasmid construct that expressed nsP3 (Amaya et al., 2014) (Fig. S1A) . Additionally, our confocal microscopy studies illustrated VEEV-nsP3 localizing as distinct cytoplasmic structures (as reported by others (Foy et al., 2013a (Foy et al., , 2013b Fig. 2 . VEEV-nsP3 associates with DDX1 and DDX3. A) U87MG cells were uninfected (Mock) or infected with rTC-83-nsP3-HA (MOI:10) for 1 h. Fresh media were added to the cells and at 6 hpi cell lysates were collected and quantified. Two milligrams of total protein from each sample was immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody or an isotype IgG control antibody. The immunoprecipitates were processed for LC/MS-MS. A total of 3 independent experiments were performed and each MS run was performed in duplicate to generate a data set that was compared and contrasted for unique proteins identified only in the rTC-83-nsP3-HA infected samples immunoprecipitated with HA. The identified proteins were tiered based on at least 50% reproducibility and additionally tiered according to peptide hits. B) U87MG cells were infected with rTC-83-nsP3-HA (MOI:20) for 1 h. Fresh media were added to the cells and at 6 hpi cell lysates were collected and quantified. Two milligrams of total protein was immunoprecipitated with an isotype IgG control or an HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the subsequent immunoblot probed with antibodies to DDX1, DDX3 or HA. The western blot is a representative image of 2 independent experiments. also able to observe localization of IKKb at 12 hpi ( Fig. S1B ). Overall, rTC-83-nsP3-HA could replicate to high titers and appropriately express viral proteins.

Total protein was immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody or an isotype IgG control antibody and processed for LC-MS/MS. MS spectra and identified peptides were searched against the NCBI human protein database. Identified host proteins from rTC-83-nsP3-HA samples were cross referenced with the Mock (IgG and HA) samples and the rTC-83-nsP3-HA (IgG) samples to identify unique candidates in the infected group. Proteins that reproduced in at least 3 out of the 6 individual sample sets that were independently subjected to MS analyses were tabulated ( Fig. 2A) . Among the proteins identified, we focused our attention on the helicases DDX1 and DDX3 based on the rationale that nsP3 functionality is likely to be important to assist in viral RNA replication and protein expression (Galbraith et al., 2006; Lastarza et al., 1994; Wang et al., 1994) .

In the DDX1 and DDX3 depleted infected cells, \u00e3 70% decrease in infectious viral titers was observed at 6 hpi, whereas at 12 hpi and 24 hpi, a~1log and 2log decrease in infectious viral titers was observed, respectively (Fig. 3C) , suggesting a time dependent decrease in infectious viral titers in DDX1 and DDX3 depleted cells. Cell lysates from the experiment performed in Fig. 3C were collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The subsequent blot was probed for VEEV capsid, DDX1, DDX3 and b-actin ( Fig. 3D) . Western blot analysis indicated that VEEV capsid levels were modestly reduced in DDX1 (Fig. 3D left) and DDX3 (Fig. 3D right) depleted cells when compared to the control. Capsid protein expression could not be detected as early as 6 hpi by western blot. In addition, intracellular and extracellular viral RNA was quantified by q-RT-PCR using VEEV specific primers. DDX1 or DDX3 depleted U87MG cells infected with rTC-83 were processed for q-RT-PCR at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. In DDX1 depleted cells a 1log decrease was observed at 6 and 12 hpi was observed whereas at 24 hpi a 50% decrease was observed in intracellular viral RNA replication when compared to the controls (Fig. 3E) . A 2log decrease in intracellular viral RNA replication was observed at 6 and 12 hpi, and a 1log decrease was observed at 24 hpi in the DDX3 depleted cells when compared to the controls. It was observed in DDX1 depleted cells at 6, 12 and 24 hpi a 50%, 70% and a 1log decrease in extracellular viral RNA replication, respectively (Fig. 3F ). In DDX3 depleted cells a~1log decrease in extracellular viral RNA was observed at 6 and 12 hpi, whereas at 24 hpi a 2log decrease was observed when compared to the rTC-83 controls. Taken together, depletion of endogenous DDX1 and DDX3 at non-toxic concentrations resulted in a significant decrease in rTC-83 replication. This suggests that these RNA helicases positively regulate VEEV replication potential, with potentially, DDX3 having a comparatively greater impact on VEEV life cycle in the context of TC-83.",

Fig. 3G demonstrated a~1log decrease with DDX1 siRNA, whereas~55% decrease in viral titers was observed with DDX3 siRNA when compared to the control. From Fig. 3G it appears that although TrD multiplication was inhibited similar to that seen with rTC-83 at 24 hpi, the extent of inhibition differed by 1log, which may speak to the difference in viral virulence between the two strains. This data suggests that the virulent TrD strain utilizes DDX1 and DDX3 for viral multiplication although, the reliance on DDX3 may be lesser for the virulent strain. Collectively, the data indicates that VEEV utilizes DDX1 and DDX3 to facilitate viral replication.",

            "text": "Viruses such as HIV-1 (Edgcomb et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2013; Yasuda-Inoue et al., 2013) and HCV (Ariumi et al., 2007; Owsianka and Patel, 1999; Tingting et al., 2006) utilize both DDX1 and DDX3 to facilitate viral replication; likewise, in our studies, VEEV-nsP3 interacted with both DDX1 and DDX3. This opens the possibility that RNA helicases may serve compensatory roles in the viral life cycle. To address this we hypothesized that depletion of both DDX1 and DDX3 would result in a greater decrease in infectious viral titers than that observed in the individual depletion studies. Western blot analysis indicated that silencing of DDX1 and DDX3 was highly efficient as early as 48 h post transfection (Fig. 4A ) at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 4B) . To determine the impact of depleting both DDX1 and DDX3 on viral multiplication, U87MG cells transfected with control or DDX1 and DDX3 siRNA were infected with rTC-83 and supernatants were collected at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. Plaque assay analysis indicated that in the DDX1/3 depletion scenario a 1log decrease in viral titers was observed at 6 hpi and 24 hpi, whereas at 12 hpi a 2log decrease in infectious viral titers was observed when compared to the respective controls (Fig. 4C) . The decrease observed in infectious viral titers using the combinatorial knockdown was modestly greater than with the individual knockdowns at 6 and 12 hpi, suggesting that DDX1 and DDX3 are more likely to serve compensatory functions in VEEV multiplication. Although the decrease in infectious viral titers observed at 24 hpi was with the double knockdown was statistically significant, it was not greater than the individual knockdowns. In addition, intracellular capsid protein expression in the siRNA studies was assessed under the same experimental conditions as Fig. 4C . Western blot analysis indicated that in comparison to the respective controls, at 12 hpi and 24 hpi capsid protein expression was reduced with DDX1/3 siRNA (Fig. 4D ). In addition, intracellular and extracellular viral RNA was quantified by q-RT-PCR. DDX1 or DDX3 depleted U87MG cells infected with rTC-83 were processed for q-RT-PCR at 6, 12 and 24 hpi. Fig. 4E indicated that at 6 and 24 hpi a 1log decrease in intracellular viral RNA replication was observed when compared to the rTC-83 controls, whereas at 12 hpi a 2log decrease was observed. Fig. 4F indicated that extracellular viral RNA was decreased by 2logs at 12 and 24 hpi, however, no significant decrease (30%) was observed at 6 hpi when compared to the rTC-83 controls. This observation leads us to speculate that the dependence on host RNA helicases may be more prominent in the context of these infected cells, at the later time points during infection when iterative rounds of viral multiplication have occurred in the infected cells. This may also be related to the relative abundance of viral multiplication in the cells that may impose additive demands on the host machinery to support a productive viral infection. To determine if DDX1 and DDX3 double knockdown extended to TrD, supernatants collected at 24 hpi from infected U87MG cells transfected with control or DDX1/3 siRNAs were analyzed by plaque assay for infectious virions. Fig. 4G demonstrated a~1log decrease with DDX1/3 siRNA when compared to the control. Taken together this data reiterates that TC-83 is likely to utilize DDX1 and DDX3 for viral multiplication.",

These components are universal markers for SGs. Multiple viruses and viral proteins such as, Junin virus (Linero et al., 2013), Rotavirus NSP3A (Piron et al., 1998) , Herpes simplex virus immediate early ICP27 protein (Fontaine-Rodriguez et al., 2004) and Influenza virus NS1 and PABP (Burgui et al., 2003) have been shown to interact with host eIFs to aid in viral multiplication. Old world alphaviruses SFV (Panas et al., 2012) , SINV and CHIKV (Fros et al., 2012) have been shown to induce SG formation in G3BP1 foci early in infected cells and interact with G3BPs (Fros et al., 2012; Panas et al., 2012; Scholte et al., 2015) . In particular SFV-nsP3 recruits G3BP and disassembles SGs (Scholte et al., 2015) . Although studies involving new world alphavirus association with SGs are limited; what is known is that VEEV-nsP3 does not associate with G3BPs (Foy et al., 2013a) .",

            "text": "DDX3 was observed to localize in SGs (Ariumi, 2014; Lai et al., 2013) , where it associates with eIF4A, eIF4G, eIF2a, eIF3 and PABP to facilitate translation of mRNA containing structured 5 0 UTR (Ariumi, 2014; Lai et al., 2013; Shih et al., 2012) . Of note, in our MS analysis, we also identified PABP as interacting with nsP3; however PABP fell below our condition of 50% reproducibility and therefore excluded from Fig. 2A . We hypothesized that the interaction of DDX3 with nsP3 may play a role in facilitating the recruitment of the eIF machinery to potentially aid in translation of viral proteins. Therefore, we asked, does VEEV-nsP3 associate with any of the eIFs that are known to interact with DDX3? To address this we proposed the following working model (Fig. 5A) . During VEEV infection, a global inhibition of cellular transcription and translation occurs (Akhrymuk et al., 2012) , resulting in accumulation of pre-existing DDX3-eIF4A-eIF4G-PABP complexes. We propose that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with DDX3 along with its preexisting partners to initiate translation of viral mRNA. To address the validity of this model, U87MG cells infected with rTC-83-nsP3-HA (MOI:20) were collected at 6 hpi, lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation. The subsequent western blot was probed with antibodies to HA, eIF4A, eIF4G, PABP and DDX3. Fig. 5B illustrates that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with the host translational factors; eIF4A, eIF4G and PABP; together with DDX3 thus supporting our proposed working model. Taken together, this data puts forth the suggestion that VEEV-nsP3 may co-opt the host translational machinery from SGs to initiate translation of viral proteins in infected cells. with the DDX3 siRNA transfectants (right panel). As a loading control the blots were probed with b-actin. Densitometric counts for DDX1, DDX3 and b-actin were obtained using the Quantity One Analysis Software. The normalized data are represented graphically below the respective western blot images. The western blot images are representative of 2 independent experiments. B) Cell viability assay was performed at 24, 48 and 72 h post transfection using the Cell Titer Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The graph is representative of 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate and is depicted as a percentage of cell viability. C) At 48 h post transfection, U87MG cells were infected with rTC-83 (MOI:0.1) for 1 h. Fresh media were added to the cells and at 6, 12 and 24 hpi supernatants were collected and analyzed by plaque assay. The graph is representative of 2 independent experiments performed in triplicate. D) At 48 h post transfection, U87MG cells were infected with rTC-83 (MOI:0.1) for 1 h. Fresh media were added to the cells and at 6, 12 and 24 hpi cell lysates were collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The subsequent blot was probed for capsid and DDX1 in the case of DDX1 siRNA transfectants (left panel) or capsid and DDX3 with the DDX3 siRNA transfectants (right panel). As a loading control the blots were probed for b-actin. The 24 hpi blots are depicted separately as these were imaged at a shorter exposure. The images are representative of 2 independent experiments. DDX1, DDX3 or control siRNA were used to transfect U87MG cells seeded at 10,000 cells per well in a 96 well plate. Transfected cells were infected with rTC-83 (MOI:0.1) for 1 h. Fresh media were added to the cells and at 6, 12 and 24 hpi cells were lysed with MagMAX\u2122-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (E) or MagMAX\u2122-96 Viral RNA isolation kit (F). Levels of viral RNA were quantified by q-RT-PCR using VEEV specific primers. The graphs are representative of 2 independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. G) U87MG cells were transfected with 10 nM of control siRNA, DDX1 or DDX3 siRNA. At 48 h post transfection, U87MG cells were infected with VEEV TrD (MOI:0.1) for 1 h. Fresh media were replaced after the infection and at 24 hpi supernatants were collected and analyzed by plaque assay. The graph is representative of a biological duplicate experiment each as technical triplicates and is depicted as percent infectious viral titers. * \u00bc p 0.05. ND \u00bc not detectable. ",

We asked if inhibiting DDX3 helicase activity would have an effect on the interactions between VEEV-nsP3 and the identified host translational components. We initially determined by cell viability assays the highest non-toxic concentration of RK-33 (1 mM) (Fig. 6A ). Next we determined if RK-33 interfered with viral RNA replication kinetics over a time course. Plaque assay analyses indicated that at 8 and 16 hpi a 1log decrease in infectious viral titers was observed when compared to the DMSO controls (Fig. 6B) . However, at 4 hpi no observable difference occurred in the RK-33 treated cells whereas at 24 hpi a 50% reduction in infectious viral titers was observed when compared to the DMSO control. Hence, we opted for a 6 hpi time point to determine if inhibition of DDX3 helicase activity interfered with the interactions between VEEV-nsP3 and the host translational components, as the inhibitor treatment at this time point would not interfere with viral replication kinetics. Western blot analysis indicated a decrease in interactions between VEEV-nsP3 and eIF4G, eIF4A and PABP (Fig. 6C, compare lanes 5 and 7) . This decrease was not due to reduced levels of VEEV-nsP3. Densitometric counts indicated that VEEV-nsP3 interactions with eIF4G, eIF4A and PABP were reduced by 54%, 86% and 44% respectively. This data indicates that DDX3 helicase activity may be necessary for VEEV-nsP3 interactions with host translational machinery to potentially facilitate viral translation.",

The introduction of an HA tag at the C-terminal end of rTC-83 (rTC-83-nsP3-HA) did not significantly impede viral replication kinetics (Fig. 1) and could therefore be utilized as a tool to characterize the VEEV-nsP3 interactome. We identified and validated RNA helicases, DDX1 and DDX3 as interacting partners of VEEV-nsP3 (Fig. 2) . DDX1 and DDX3 were found to have an effect on rTC-83 multiplication (Figs. 3 and 4) . Although we observed a similar decrease in TrD multiplication when compared to rTC-83, the extent of inhibition differed by a log, which may speak to the difference in virulence between the two strains. The U87MG glioblastoma cell model is an attractive system to study host-based candidates for development of therapeutics against alphavirus infections. Additional studies with primary brain cells will enable us to further our understanding of the magnitude of relevance of DDX1 and DDX3 to new world alphavirus infections.",

To that effect, we have observed that the dependence of the virulent TrD strain on DDX3 is lesser than that of TC-83 (Fig. 4) , which may also attest to the dependence on host helicases as a reflection of viral virulence.",

This suggests that RNA helicases may serve redundant roles in the viral life cycle or may be utilized at different time points in the viral life cycle to serve different roles. On that note, it is important to bear in mind that during the course of infection, different pools of VEEV-nsP3 may be present that interact with a selected subset of host proteins, which may speak to VEEV-nsP3 interacting with DDX1 and DDX3 at different times during infection to serve different roles in the viral life cycle. This may offer a plausible explanation to the additive effect of the double knockdown scenario where a decrease in infectious viral titers was greater than that observed with the individual knockdowns at the earlier time points of infection (Figs. 3C and 4C) ; however, at 24 hpi similar levels of infectious viral titers were detected between the individual and combinatorial knockdowns.

Furthermore, that study indicated that DDX3 is capable of nucleating stress granule formation, and that the core helicase domain of DDX3 was sufficient for its localization to SGs (Thulasi Raman et al., 2016) . This offers further support to the loss of interactions we observed between VEEV-nsP3 and the host translational machinery with treatment of RK-33. Alternatively, VEEV-nsP3 could usurp these host factors to disassemble the SGs to create an environment suitable for efficient viral multiplication. A similar subversion of SGs is necessary for establishment of a successful influenza infection, as knockdown of DDX3 impaired stress granule formation and increased viral titers (Thulasi Raman et al., 2016) .

Our data have demonstrated that VEEV-nsP3 associates with DDX1 and DDX3 in infected cells to facilitate viral multiplication. As a putative mechanism for these interactions, we determined that VEEV-nsP3 interacts with a pre-formed translational complex, comprising of DDX3:eIF4A:eIF4G:PABP to potentially aid in translation of viral proteins. Novel components of the nsP3 interactome in infected cells can, therefore, pave the way for novel therapeutic intervention strategies. 5 . VEEV-nsP3 interacts with components of the host translational machinery. A) Working model for VEEV-nsP3 interaction with eukaryotic initiation factors. During shut off of cellular transcription and translation pre-existing DDX3, eIF4A, eIF4G and PABP complexes are stalled in cytoplasmic SGs. During VEEV infection, VEEV-nsP3 interacts with these pre-existing complexes to initiate translation of viral mRNA. eIF4E initially recognizes 5 0 methylguanosine caps on VEEV RNA and then complexes with eIF4A (helicase) and eIF4G (scaffold protein) to form the eIF4F complex, which then recruits the 40S ribosome. PABP binds to the poly(A) tail present at the 3 0 -end of VEEV RNA circularizing VEEV RNA. B) U87MG cells were infected with rTC-83-nsP3-HA (MOI:20) for 1 h.

During VEEV infection, VEEV-nsP3 interacts with these pre-existing complexes to initiate translation of viral mRNA. eIF4E initially recognizes 5 0 methylguanosine caps on VEEV RNA and then complexes with eIF4A (helicase) and eIF4G (scaffold protein) to form the eIF4F complex, which then recruits the 40S ribosome. PABP binds to the poly(A) tail present at the 3 0 -end of VEEV RNA circularizing VEEV RNA. B) U87MG cells were infected with rTC-83-nsP3-HA (MOI:20) for 1 h. At 6 hpi cell lysates were collected, quantified and 2 mg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with an isotype IgG control or an HA antibody.
