Thus a challenge study inducing WSSV in juvenile white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was established, setting 4 groups: challengednot treated and unchallenged, untreated control groups and two experimental ones (E1 and E2) both treated with diammonium glycyrrhizic acid, extracted from licorice with added vitamins and oligoelements, and as in-feed medication. Group E1 received diammonium glycyrrhizic acid included in their daily feed, starting 17 days before challenge with WSSV and maintaining the treatment for further 5 days after the end of the trial, which was set on day 18. Group E2 received this medication as group E1 throughout the trial, but starting 1 day before the challenge with WSSV. The group with highest surviving median values was E1, amounting two times the survival median in comparison with the control groups (P = 0.007). Also a statistical difference was found in terms of survival means in favor of group E1 as compared to group E2. Macroscopic and histopathological findings revealed lesions compatible with WSSV and similar mortality in the challenged untreated group. These findings were highly reduced or inexistent in mortality analyzed from groups E1 as well as in the unchallengeduntreated control group and greatly reduced in group E2. Considering the apparent high efficacy observed and that glycyrrhizic acid and mineral and vitamin components added as treatment, and taking as an advantage that this preparation has been regarded as nutraceuticals, it is here proposed that large scale trials should be conducted to evaluate the effects here observed in commercial and larger scale shrimp farms.",

            "text": "In spite of difficulties, shrimp production is an important and profitable food producing industry. Even though, in many countries cultured shrimp production has been severely hindered by various viral diseases i.e., white spot syndrome -WSSV Rosenberry, 2001) . First signs of this disease, such as sudden reduction in food consumption and red discoloration, are followed by a sharp increase in mortality in shrimp farms over the next 3-10 days, even reaching 100% mortality (Peinado-Guevara and L\u00f3pez-Meyer, 2006) . First description of WSSV appears to have been from an outbreak in Taiwan in 1992 (Chen, 1995; Chou et al., 1995) . This disease seems to have spread world-wide, except perhaps to Australia. It has been suggested that world weather changes have contributed to the dissemination of this disease (Sonnenholzner et al., 2002) . As the name of the disease suggests, the main signs of WSSV are 0.5-2.0 mm white spots in the interior part of the shell, appendixes, uropods, telson, pereiopods, pleopods and cuticle of the abdominal segments (Takahashi et al., 1994) . The color of shrimps becomes pale red and the lymphoid organ becomes turgid (Takahashi et al., 1994) , and it has been described as hypertrophic (Vidal et al., 2001) . Diseased shrimps become lethargic, and they show erratic swimming and lack of appetite and die during the next three days.",

It has been claimed that this drug preparation stimulates production of gamma interferon in human beings (Sugawara, 1986) . Glycyrrhizic acid possesses antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo interfering with both DNA and RNA replications, hence interfering with replication of a wide range of viruses, including herpes, influenza A and B, hepatitis B, coronavirus, and SARS (Badam, 1994; Chen, 1995; Durand et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2007; Lin, 2003; Pompei et al., 2009) . Glycyrrhizic acid has also demonstrated to be capable of impeding virion eclosion from its capside (Pompei et al., 2009) , apparently due to a dose-dependant inhibition Aquaculture 428-429 (2014) 280-283 of kinase-P phosphorylation (Chavali et al., 1987) . Additionally, it has been shown to interfere with arylamine N-acetyltransferase bacterial activity, hence exhibiting antibacterial effects at least vs Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., and Klebsiella spp. (Krausse et al., 2004; Lo et al., 1996; Tanaka et al., 2001) .",

Hence it is therefore difficult to contain it or avoiding outbreaks in most commercial shrimp farms. It is a very virulent pathological agent and causes higher percent mortalities (Sahul Hameed et al., 2001) . To date, no full effective preventive measures to keep a farm isolated or useful pharmacological cures have been proposed. In this context, this report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful pharmaceutical preparation capable of preventing or at least minimizing mortality caused by WSSV. The resistance mechanism of shrimps to WSSV and other viruses is incompletely understood. Various studies on how shrimp survives to viral infections state that the individual immune processes play a key role, such as infiltration, phagocytosis and encapsulation of viruses within a given tissue (Durand et al., 1997; Momoyama et al., 1994) . In shrimp, the lymphoid organ is an integral part of the circulatory system, and can act as viral-particle filter (Bell and Lightner, 1988) . Pazir et al. (2011) describe intra-nuclear bodies in lymphoid organ cells of diseased shrimps (L. vannamei) diagnosed with WSSV in farms of the Persian Gulf. The lesions there described comply closely with the ones observed in this trial, including karyorrhexis in some cells in the lymphoid organ as well as basophilic inclusion bodies within the nucleus. Yet, these formation spheres also occur in at least six different viral infections on peneid shrimps (Bonami et al., 1992) . Hence, this finding is hardly pathognomonic of WSSV.",
