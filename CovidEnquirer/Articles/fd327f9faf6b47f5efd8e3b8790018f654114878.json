The present study investigated the genotypic relationship between CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains and reference IBVs based on S1 gene comparisons and the protection provided by vaccination with commercial vaccines and attenuated homologous and heterologous strains. Phylogenetic analysis and the comparison of S1 showed that CK/CH/LDL/97I-type virus might be a new serotype compared to vaccine strains and other types of IBV isolates in China. Protection efficacy was evaluated by morbidity, mortality, and virus re-isolation from the challenged chicks. Complete protection by IBV vaccination was provided by the homologous strain but sufficient respiratory protection was not provided by the commercial vaccines. Heterologous strains against CK/CH/LDL/97I challenge and the development of a vaccine against CK/CH/LDL/97I-type IBV will be necessary to control infectious bronchitis disease in poultry. Further development of the attenuated CK/CH/LDL/97I strain may provide a valuable contribution towards this goal.",

Different IBV strains may be responsible for distinct illnesses. Based on virus neutralisation (VN) tests, IBV exists as dozens of serotypes. Although vaccines have generally been used in controlling the clinical disease, infectious bronchitis (IB) outbreaks occur frequently owing to the antigenic differences between serotypes (Arvidson et al., 1991; Bochkov et al., 2006; Cook et al., 2001; Gelb et al., 1981 Gelb et al., , 2005 Hofstad, 1981; Ladman et al., 2006; Marquardt et al., 1982) and the development of vaccines from local field isolates is necessary for control.",

The S glycoprotein is proteolitically processed into two non-covalently bound peptide chains known as S1 and S2 (Stein and Sefton, 1982) . The S1 protein of IBV has serotype-specific and neutralisation-specific epitopes, and serotypic evolution and the genetic diversity of IBV are mainly monitored by analysis of the S1 gene. As might be expected, cross-protection tends to diminish as the degree of amino acid identity between the S1 proteins of two IBV strains decreases Gelb et al., 2005) . It has been reported that comparing IBV S1 gene sequences is a better predictor of immune response to challenge in chickens than serotyping by VN (Ladman et al., 2006) , and gene sequence comparisons were used in these studies for virus typing. However, VN is probably a more practical method in terms of control strategies for performing protection studies (protectotype) with the field isolates (Cook et al., 1999) .",

In the present study most of the vaccines used in China to prevent IB and IBV isolate representatives of different genotypes circulating in chicken flocks were selected for phylogenetic analysis and S1 gene comparison with those of CK/CH/ LDL/97I-type strains. CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains clearly belonged to different clusters in comparison to the Fig. 1 . The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour-joining and bootstrap analysis (n = 1000) based on the S1 subunit of spike protein (Huang et al., 2004; Saitou and Nei, 1987; Schikora1 et al., 2003) . Bootstrap values >60% are displayed above branch nodes. The tree was rooted with the first 1656 nt of the S protein genes, starting at the AUG translation initiation codon. reference strains (Fig. 1) , suggesting that the CK/CH/ LDL/97-type strains may differ genotypically not only with the selected vaccine strains, but also with other types of IBVs circulating in China. It has been reported that S1 amino acids of different IBV serotypes usually differ by 20-25% (Gelb et al., 1997) . In our study, <80% homology of nucleotides and amino acids in the S1 domain of the spike protein was observed between CK/CH/LDL/97I and the vaccine strains, as well as between CK/CH/LDL/ 97I and other types of IBV isolates from China. This indicates that CK/CH/LDL/97I-type viruses are a different serotype than the vaccine strains and the other types of IBV isolates examined.",

However, in most cases, it is reported that IBV isolates with high S1 homology induce a high degree of cross-protection. Accordingly, IBV strains with low S1 homology provide little or inconsistent crossprotection (Cavanagh, 1997; Ladman et al., 2006) . Little S1 similarity between CK/CH/LDL/97I and the vaccine strains in this study could explain the poor clinical and respiratory protection conferred against CK/CH/LDL/ 97I challenge in the chickens vaccinated with heterologous viruses. This might be why the birds from which CK/CH/ LDL/971-like isolates were recovered developed disease in spite of being vaccinated with IBV vaccines (Liu et al., 2006b; Yu et al., 2001a) .",

This was determined by re-isolation of the virus from kidneys 5 days post-challenge and is a useful tool in evaluating protection conferred by IBV commercial vaccines against IBV challenge (Alvarado et al., 2003) . It was shown that circulating antibody levels were of minor importance in the protection of the respiratory mucosa against challenge (Hofstad, 1967; Holmes, 1973; Macdonald et al., 1981) . However, nephritis can be induced by infection of the respiratory tract presumably following viraemia. Although circulating antibody against IBV played only a minor role in protection of the respiratory tract, humoral immune mechanisms directed against viraemia appeared to be of particular importance in protecting the kidney (Holmes, 1973; Macdonald et al., 1981; Marquardt et al., 1982) . All of the vaccinated birds showed seroconversion after 20 days post-inoculation and this antibody contributed to protection of kidneys against the nephropathogenic CK/ CH/LDL/97I challenge.",
