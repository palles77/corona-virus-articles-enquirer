            "text": "An integrated reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) microdevice which consists of microbead-assisted RNA purification and RT-LAMP with real-time monitoring by a miniaturized optical detector was demonstrated. The integrated RT-LAMP microdevice includes four reservoirs for a viral RNA sample (purified influenza A viral RNA or lysates), a washing solution (70% ethanol), an elution solution (RNase-free water), and an RT-LAMP cocktail, and two chambers (a waste chamber and an RT-LAMP reaction chamber). The separate reservoirs for a washing solution, an elution solution, and an RT-LAMP cocktail were designed with capillary valves for stable storage. Three influenza A virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and A/H5N1) were used for RNA templates, and RT-LAMP primer sets were designed to detect hemagglutinin (HA) and conserved M gene. Sequential sample flow to the microbeads for RNA purification was achieved by centrifugal force with optimization of capillary valves and a siphon channel. Furthermore, the purified RNA solution was successfully isolated from the waste solution by changing the rotational direction, and combined with the RT-LAMP cocktail in the RT-LAMP reaction chamber for target gene amplification. Total process from the sample injection to the result was completed in 47 min. Influenza A H1N1 virus was confirmed on the integrated RT-LAMP microdevice even with 10 copies of viral RNAs, which revealed 10-fold higher sensitivity than that of a conventional RT-PCR. Subtyping and specificity test of influenza A H1N1 viral lysates were also performed and clinical samples were successfully genotyped to confirm influenza A virus on our proposed integrated microdevice.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus, one of the zoonotic pathogen, have been rampant periodically throughout the world for centuries. In every year, about 500 million of human infections and 0.25-0.5 million of victims are generated in worldwide from respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (Arias et al., 2009; Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011) . Pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 generated from swine in Mexico was created by multiple reassortment events (Vijaykrishna et al., 2010) . It caused about 18,000 of human victims and was diagnosed in more than 214 nations for about 17 months from April, 2009 to August, 2010 according to the latest update from World Health Organization (WHO) (2009). Thus, early diagnosis of influenza A virus is of paramount importance to prevent human victims as well as economic damages (Lazcka et al., 2007) . Among a number of diagnostic tools, the genetic analysis based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been considered most sensitive, specific and accurate (Hoffmann et al., 2001) . Typically, the PCR method requires three distinct temperature for denature, annealing, and extension for thermal cycling. However, the precise temperature control inevitably increases the cost and bulkiness of the instrumentation, which hinders the on-site genetic analysis capability (Asiello and Baeumner, 2011; Parida et al., 2008) . The ramping rate for transitioning between the three temperature zones takes time leading to elongating PCR process. Moreover, the enzyme activity can be reduced as the repeated thermal cycling proceeds continuously. To overcome these limitations of the conventional PCR, isothermal amplification methods such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Notomi et al., 2000) , nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) (Compton, 1991) , rolling circle amplification (RCA) (Lizardi et al., 1998) , helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) (Vincent et al., 2004) , and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) (Piepenburg et al., 2006; Rohrman and Richards-Kortum, 2012; Shin et al., 2013) have been recently developed (Morisset et al., 2008) . Isothermal amplification employs one mild temperature with specifically designed primer sets to boost up the quantity of the target gene. Among isothermal amplification methods, LAMP uses six primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement reaction at 60-65\u00b0C within 1 h (Notomi et al., 2000) . Since six primer sets of LAMP recognize eight distinct sequence on the target gene, the specificity of the gene amplification is available. Since a simple water bath or a heating block can substitute a thermal cycler for temperature control, a miniaturized genetic analysis system is more feasible for on-site viral detection (Parida et al., 2008) . Regarding the detection of influenza virus, the RNA template is generally targeted and the reverse transcription should be performed as a first step. To this end, reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was also developed by adding reverse transcriptase enzymes under the identical reaction conditions of LAMP (Mori and Notomi, 2009 ). Using the RT-LAMP, various epidemics and epizootics such as a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Thai et al., 2004) , influenza A virus (Ito et al., 2006) , and foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Dukes et al., 2006) were identified.",

Thus, the combination of the microfluidic device with the RT-LAMP content can provide an advanced pathogen analysis methodology (Chang et al., 2013; Hataoka et al., 2004) . Fang et al. (2011) reported a PDMS-glass hybrid microdevice for RT-LAMP with a reflected optical sensor to detect multiplex influenza A viruses. Wang et al. (2011) demonstrated an RT-LAMP microdevice which integrates a magnetic bead mediated RNA purification. In this platform, a nervous necrosis virus was analyzed within 60 min and the detection sensitivity was 100-fold higher than a conventional RT-PCR. Full integration of RNA purification by a Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) membrane, an RT-LAMP reaction, and real-time fluorescence detection on a chip was presented to identify HIV particles by Liu et al. (2011) . However, the previously reported RT-LAMP microdevices necessitates intermittent manual operation for sample loading, and complex tubing systems for fluidic control, which unavoidably cause the contamination issues during RT-LAMP and reduce the data reproducibility (Chen et al., 2010; Oakley et al., 2009) . Thus, an advanced microdevice, which integrates all the necessary steps and is operated automatically without complicated tube networks and human intervention, is desired for more reliable point-of-care pathogen detection.",

Despite of the high sensitivity and rapidity, the DNA extraction step was performed on the off-chip basis. Hoehl et al.

For example, the used washing solution was 70% ethanol which has low contact angle. Due to the high wettability of 70% ethanol, the loaded washing solution tends to uncontrollably move along the channel wall, once loaded. To prevent such a random flow, the washing solution reservoir was patterned as shown in Fig. 1b(i) . First, a ring structure (200 \u03bcm depth) was fabricated to induce strong capillary force, which can hold the loaded washing solution inside the ring pattern. The capillary force should be strong enough to endure the liquid pressure to inhibit the washing solution leakage. Fig. 1b(ii) shows the bottom view of the washing solution reservoir which displayed the inner and outer ring patterns. The depth of the pattern was roughly calculated in Supplementary material in detail. In order to prevent wetting of a top sealing tape during the injection of a washing solution, a 250 \u03bcm deep pattern was fabricated, which ensured the perfect sealing of an adhesive tape to eliminate the contamination and evaporation issues during RT-LAMP process (Focke et al., 2010) . Both the elution solution reservoir and the RT-LAMP cocktail reservoir were also designed with a ring pattern with 250 \u03bcm depth to firmly store the liquid during the injection step ( Fig. 1c (i) and (ii) shows the bottom view of those reservoirs).",

While the RT-LAMP cocktail was directly transported to the RT-LAMP chamber earlier, the RNase-free water passed through the bead-bed microchannel to deliver the purified RNAs into the RT-LAMP chamber afterwards. Since the rotational direction was opposite to the initial step, the driving force was exerted on the bottom right. So, the RNase-free water, which carried the purified RNAs, was moved to the RT-LAMP chamber, not to the waste chamber. We prolonged this step for 90 s to fully recover the residual water on the microbeads as shown in Fig. S2b (iv-vi).

The centrifugal rotation of the integrated microdevice was driven by a servo motor (AC Servo Motor, HF-KP13, Mitsubishi, Japan) and automatically controlled by an in-house LabVIEW program. The temperature control system was presented in the previous report in details (Jung et al., 2012) . Thermal blocks incorporated with a film heater (MINCO\u2122, MN, USA) and a resistive temperature detector (RTD, RdF Corporation, NH, USA) were set up on the rotary stage and used for precise temperature control with a designed electrical circuit and an in-house LabVIEW software. For real-time monitoring of genetic amplification, a miniaturized optical detector was installed to the rotary portable microsystem. The collimated beam from the optical fluorescence detector is focused on the RT-LAMP chamber by emitting 488 nm laser and the fluorescence signal in the range of 500-530 nm was detected by a photomultiplier tube with high sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 2a , the fluorescence emission from the three RT-LAMP chambers were serially measured by the optical detector every 1 min when the chip rotated 120\u00b0. A detection hole was fabricated on the system cover made of Teflon for installation of an optical detector. Thus, real-time monitoring of the RT-LAMP amplification could be performed with the system cover tightly sealed as shown in Fig. 2b .",

The influenza A virus could be identified with 10 2 copies in the real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, the detection sensitivity of our integrated centrifugal microsystem was enhanced by 10-fold compared with that of the conventional realtime RT-PCR. Whereas the conventional PCR requires time-consuming thermal cycling steps, the isothermal amplification needs only single reaction temperature. In addition, rapid amplification can be realized in the microfluidic-based platform owing to the smaller thermal inertia, low thermal mass, and high surface to volume ratio of the reaction chamber. Thus, our microfluidic based isothermal amplification system produced higher sensitivity than that of the conventional real-time RT-PCR (Chang et al., 2013) .",

To this end, the subtyping test of an influenza A H1N1 virus was investigated on the integrated RT-LAMP microsystem. H1 gene and M gene were targeted to identify influenza A H1N1 virus. The RT-LAMP cocktails which contained H1 gene specific primer sets and M gene specific primer sets were loaded in the RT-LAMP cocktail reservoirs separately, and the RNA purification and the RT-LAMP reaction were conducted simultaneously. In this case, we used viral lysates directly as a sample solution instead of purified RNAs. As shown in Fig. 5a , both the H1 and M gene were successfully amplified, resulting in the improved fluorescence signal along with the reaction time. The threshold time gap (8 min for M gene and 11 min for H1 gene) may be due to the difference of the primer binding affinity on the target template and the amplification efficiency during the RT-LAMP reaction. Since our integrated microdevice could perform three RT-LAMP reactions at one time (Fig. 2a) , the subtyping of influenza A virus was possible. Following the previous subtyping of influenza A virus, we tested the specificity of H1 targeting primer sets by applying them for amplifying H3 and H5 genes. Influenza A H3N2 and H5N1 viral lysates were used as RNA templates, and the fluorescence signal was real-time monitored on a chip (Fig. 5b) . In both samples, there were no amplicons produced, showing the fluorescence intensities at the background level even after 40 min. These results indicate that the H1 targeting primer sets were specific to the H1 gene (Fig. 5a) . On the other hand, when the M gene targeting primer sets were used, the M gene was amplified in both influenza A H3N2 and H5N1 viruses as the reaction time went by. Thus, the designed M gene primers were successfully targeting the conserved region of M gene, and universal to identify the influenza A virus. The RT-LAMP microdevice allows us to pathotype and subtype the influenza A virus at one time.",

            "text": "In summary, we have demonstrated an integrated rotary genetic analysis microsystem, which consisted of an integrated RT-LAMP microdevice, a rotational platform, and a miniaturized optical detector. Through the sophisticated microfluidic design, and the rotation scheme, we could serially perform the RNA extraction for 7 min and the real-time RT-LAMP reaction for 40 min in a simplified polycarbonate microdevice. Using influenza A H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 viral samples, the target gene amplification (H1 and M genes) was in situ detected with 10 copies of LOD, which sensitivity was 10-fold higher than that of a conventional RT-PCR. The on-site pathotyping and subtyping of the influenza A virus on a chip could be realized with high speed, automation, and sensitivity, providing an advanced genetic analysis platform in the clinical and biomedical diagnostic fields.",
