            "text": "The CVTree web server (http://tlife.fudan.edu.cn/ cvtree) presented here is a new implementation of the whole genome-based, alignment-free composition vector (CV) method for phylogenetic analysis. It is more efficient and user-friendly than the previously published version in the 2004 web server issue of Nucleic Acids Research. The development of whole genome-based alignment-free CV method has provided an independent verification to the traditional phylogenetic analysis based on a single gene or a few genes. This new implementation attempts to meet the challenge of ever increasing amount of genome data and includes in its database more than 850 prokaryotic genomes which will be updated monthly from NCBI, and more than 80 fungal genomes collected manually from several sequencing centers. This new CVTree web server provides a faster and stable research platform. Users can upload their own sequences to find their phylogenetic position among genomes selected from the server's inbuilt database. All sequence data used in a session may be downloaded as a compressed file. In addition to standard phylogenetic trees, users can also choose to output trees whose monophyletic branches are collapsed to various taxonomic levels. This feature is particularly useful for comparing phylogeny with taxonomy when dealing with thousands of genomes.",

Some more recent phylogenomic studies are based on concatenation of a larger number of proteins. The ever burgeoning genome sequencing projects worldwide have prompted several whole-genome phylogenetic approaches. However, most-if not all-rely on sequence alignment at some stage and therefore depend on many parameters, such as the use of scoring matrices. As modern prokaryotic and fungal taxonomy depends more and more on the traditional phylogeny, there is an urgent need to develop alternative approaches.",

One collects all protein products in a genome and counts the number of (overlapping) K-tuples to form a raw CV with 20 K or 4 K components, depending on whether protein or coding DNA sequences are used (both options are allowed in CVTree, but protein sequences are recommended). Furthermore, one predicts the number of K-tuples from that of K \u00c0 1-mers and K \u00c0 2-mers by using a simple Markovian assumption. The differences between the prediction and the actual counts are taken as new components of a 'renormalized' CV.

Two-step implementation of CVTree. CVTree implements a two-step strategy to produce phylogenetic trees. In the first step, CVTree reads in each genome sequence and counts the frequency of all K-tuples. Then the CV of each organism is calculated and dumped to the hard disk (CV files). In the second step, CVTree calculates the dissimilarity matrix from the correlation between CVs. Finally, the tree files are generated by the neighbor-joining program in PHYLIP package.",

At present, the progress of prokaryotic and fungal phylogeny has made detailed comparison with taxonomy feasible. However, it is not easy to comprehend a tree with hundreds or more leaves. To simplify the job, we collapse an original genome tree to different taxonomic levels taking monophyleticity of branches as a guiding principle. For example, at the phylum level the 36 species/strains classified as Cyanobacteria do form a monophyletic branch. This branch is replaced by a single node labeled by Cyanobacteriaf36g. The reduction can only be partial, as, for example, the phylum Proteobacteria does not appear as a monophyletic group in a tree. However, three out of the five classes in this phylum do form monophyletic branches. Therefore, Alphaproteobacteriaf104g, Betaproteobacteriaf62g and Epsilonproteobacteriaf24g nodes appear when the tree is collapsed to class level. In this way, the number of leaves in a collapsed tree may be greatly reduced.",
