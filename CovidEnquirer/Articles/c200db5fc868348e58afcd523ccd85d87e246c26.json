These enzymes sub-divide T4 dC-DNA into 73 defined fragments. The alignment of the physical and the genetical maps then was achieved with three sorts of experiments: a) the identification of some EcoRl restriction fragments on the T 4 physical map which are known to carry defined T 4 genes (3, 4) b) the localization of the T 4 rII region with the aid of two deletion mutants c) the hybridization of early and late mRNA to the T 4 restriction fragments, which allows the identification of those restriction fragments carrying the early and the late regions.",

At various times after temperature shift the cells were fixed and examined by a number of microscopic techniques which yielded the following results: After 15 min, evaginations on the surface of the plasma membrane (ruffles) were observed in the SEM. Concomitantly, immunofluorescence showed accumulations of the contractile proteins, actin and IX-actinin on the cell surface. By use of the cathodoluminescence mode in the scanning microscope it was possible to show that the ruffles themselves contain contractile proteins. A number of hours later the actint;ontaining cytoskeleton stress fibres become disorganised, the ruffles disappear and the cells assume the typical rounded-up, transformed morphology. The early presence of actin and IX-actinin within ruffles as well as the dissociation of the stress fibres indicates that one or more of the contractile proteins may serve either directly or indirectly as a target site for pp60 src We have studied viral glycoprotein synthesis in wild-type retrovirus infected cells by immunoprecipitating labelled cell extracts with antiglycoprotein sera. In pulsed, chased or long-term labelled cells, the major glycoprotein related component electrophoreses slower than gp85 but faster than the disulfide linked VGP (i.e. gp85-S-S-gp35). Its mobility is identical under reducing or non-reducing conditions and, due to its presence in pulsed cells, is identified as the precursor to the glycoproteins, Pr92. Gp85 cannot be detected in infected cells or on the cell surface. These results point to the cleavage of Pr92 occurring after budding as suggested by Klemenz and Diggelmann (1979 J. Virol. 29, 285-292 . Concomitant with or after cleavage, there is an increase in molecular weight possibly by glycosylation.",

However, the immunoprecipitable components within the cell are identical to those in wild-type -i.e. Pr92 can be detected in normal amounts.

FRIIS A phosphoprotein of molecular weight 60,000 d (pp60 src ) has been identified as the putative product of the \"src\" gene of Rous sarcoma virus, the gene responsible for the transformed phenotype. Furthermore, a protein kinase (pp60 src K) activity has been demonstrated to be associated with immune precipitates containing pp60src. Using several transformation defective temperature sensitive mutants of Rous sarcoma virus we have demonstrated that at the non-permissive temperature very little pp60 src K activity can be detected despite almost normal synthesis of pp60 src . When such mutant infected cells are shifted to the permissive temperature there is a rapid increase in detectable pp60src K activity (within 15 min) which is not prevented by cycloheximide at concentrations sufficient to prevent de novo synthesis of pp60src. Furthermore, if mutant infected cells are shifted from the permissive to the non-permissive temperature there is a rapid loss of kinase activity (within 15 min). These rapid changes in pp60 src K activity are paralleled by changes in the degree of phosphorylation of the mutant pp60 src .",

Using several Prague ts mutants defective in transformation we have demonstrated that at the non-permissive temperature very little kinase activity can be detected despite almost normal synthesis of pp60 src . When such mutant infected cells are shifted to the permissive temperature there is a rapid increase in detectable kinase activity (within 15 min) which is not prevented if the shift is done in the presence of cycloheximide at concentrations sufficient to prevent de novo synthesis of pp60 src . Therefore the rapid increase in kinase activity is partly due to reactivation of the responsible molecule(s) made at the non-permissive temperature. Furthermore, if mutant infected cells are shifted from the permissive to the non-permissive temperature there is a rapid loss of kinase activity (within 15 min). Thus at the non-permissive temperature, the functional kinase molecule(s) made at the permissive temperature are rapidly inactivated. 1 Institutes for Virology, 2 Pharmacology, and 3 Endocrinology, University, 6300 Giel~en The product of the transforming gene of Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV) (1) is a phosphoprotein of 60,000 d molecular weight, pp60src. In immunoprecipitates of pp60 src , a proteinkinase activity can be demonstrated (2). This activity may be an enzymatic function of pp60 src , since it is more heat labile in vitro when derived from cells transformed by RSV mutants which are temperature-sensitive for transformation (ts td) (3).",

The following results were obtained: 1. The proviral DNA sequences are in target and nontarget cells organized in nucleosomal structures. 2. The genetically transmitted copy of the viral genome is in lymphatic target cells but not in non-target (liver) cells preferentially digestible with DNase I. This shows that this copy of the viral genome is integrated into the mouse genome at a site where it is specifically activated in lymphatic cells. 3. Leukemogenesis is accompanied by an amplification of proviral M-MuLV sequences in target cells. The amplified copies of the viral genome are not present as free proviral DNA but are also integrated into the mouse genome and organized in nucleosomal structures. 4. The majority of the amplified and reintegrated proviral M-MuLV DNA sequences in the target cells is in a transcriptionally active, i.e., DNase I-sensitive chromatin conformation. In non-target cells the proviral M-MuLV sequences remain DNase I-resistant throughout the lives of the mice. The humoral immune response of STU mice to envelope glycoproteins of Friend leukaemia virus (FL V) was investigated. Furthermore the induced immunity was challenged with an erythroleukaemia inducing dose of FLV. 8-10 weeks old mice were immunised twice with 32S aggregates of gp85 suspended in PBS or complete Freund adjuvant. Serum antibodies from repeated bleedings of individual mice were examined by cytotoxicity tests and immunoprecipitation. The development of erythroleukaemia after challenge was monitored with white blood counts, spleen weight and titration of infectious virus from spleens. An antibody response was detectable only in those animals which had received 5 to 50 {lg of gp85. Adjuvant increased the serum cytotoxicity against AKR virus producing cells and elicited antibodies precipitating envelope polypeptides of BALB xenotropic and feline leukaemia viruses. A significant reduction of virus induced spleenomegaly was recorded four weeks after challenge in the group which had received 0.5 {lg of FL V gp85. The number of nucleated cells in the peripheral blood correlated well with the extent of spleenomegaly. Small spleens of immunised mice contained 10 to 100 times less infectious virus than large spleens of the same group. Thus, the immunological effector mechanism of this protective effect is probably distinct from the antibody response.",

SCHNEIDER, H. FALK, and G. HUNS MANN On the envelope of mature Friend murine leukaemia virus roughly 10% of surface glycoproteins are coupled to membrane polypeptides by disulfide bridges. The remaining 90% of these glycoproteins are noncovalently associated in the same fashion. This fraction is converted into the covalently linked form by oxidation. The resulting amphiphilic heterodimer polypeptide gp84/86 is recovered almost quantitatively as aggregates, named rosettes, by solubilisation of the viral membrane with Triton X-lOO and subsequent velocity sedimentation. gp69 In and p12E/15E were purified from these protein micelles by molecular sieve chromatography after reduction of disulfide bonds. Electron micrographs of rosettes as well as p12E/15E showed structures differing from native viral knobs. Isolated gp84/86 could be reassociated and then displayed more similarity to these viral surface projections. As shown by peptide mapping, the primary structures of glycoproteins and membrane polypeptides, respectively, appeared to be highly related. Furthermore it was shown by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reelectrophoresis of purified gp85 /86 that the larger component gp86 comprised gp71 associated with p15E and p12E while the smaller gp84 was formed by gp69 bound only to p12E.

Immunological, biochemical and electron microscopical investigations of teratocarcinoma cells led to the demonstration of human C-type virus particles (see also accompanying presentation by R.Lower et al. . HD DNA fails to integrate into the genome of the host cell and is perpetuated exclusively as free circular molecule from one cell to another. In the latent state the HD genome is proliferated without production of virions; the latent viral DNA is, however, transcribed into RNA. Vero cells bearing latent viral genomes show certain characteristics of transformation such as growth under low serum and breakdown of actin cables. The viral DNA replication is under stringent host cell control. Under certain conditions of passaging of the cells viral DNA molecules can segregate within originally HD DNA containing cell lines of clonal origin. There may arise cells that have lost the HD DNA owing to segregation. Trypsinisation of HD virus producing cells at short intervals of time (every third day or up to weekly intervals) causes rapid loss of virus producing cells, Sometimes only a few producer-cells remain amongst millions of nonproducer-cells. In contrast, passaging of the virus-producing cell population in intervals of three weeks leads to a steady increase of producing cells within the cell culture (as shown by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence) such that almost one-half of the cell population is comprized. The relationship between viral DNA replication and the physiological state of the host cell may depend on a factor for replication of DNA which is predominantly used for synthesis of cellular DNA. Fetal calf brain cells were infected with Bovine Papillomarvius (BPV) in the sixth passage. The virus was isolated from skin warts and purified by two subsequent density equilibrium centrifugations in CsCI followed by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient. -Cells were passaged in weekly intervals at a splitting ratio of 1: 2. Three weeks after infection DNA was isolated from the cells and analysed in Southern blot hybridisation. -As a result it was shown that BPV DNA persisted for at least three passages in the cells as an unintegrated superhelical genome. -In additional Southern blot experiments DNA was analysed, which was derived from two spontaneous occurring equine fibroma-like tumors, termed equine sarkoid. Only un integrated, superhelical papilloma DNA could be revealed. Fast-sedimenting virion-like SV40 nucleoprotein complexes were extracted from nuclei of productively infected cells. These complexes were compared with CsCI-purified SV40 virus by zone velocity and equilibrium density centrifugation, electron microscopy and plaque assay (1) . Although they cosedimented at 240S with purified virus and banded at the same buoyant density after fixation in formaldehyde, they were unstable at high ionic strength, slightly larger in diameter and more infectious. Resedimentation experiments showed that the labile complexes dissociate to empty capsids, DNA-protein complexes and free protein at high ionic strength. Control experiments indicated that these complexes are unlikely to be degradation products of mature virus. In fact, the kinetics of formation of labile fast-sedimenting complexes and stable virus suggest that labile SV40 complexes may represent intermediates in virus assembly. These results are summarized in a new model of SV40 assembly in which viral chromatin is not introduced into empty capsids, as proposed earlier (2), but rather capsid proteins are deposited on the viral chromatin to form a labile encapsidated structure which subsequently matures to a stable particle. Simian virus 40 (SV40) codes for two early proteins, the 90K and 17K tumor antigens, which can be immunoprecipitated from extracts of SV40 -transformed cells and productively infected cells with serum from tumor-bearing hamsters. Immunoprecipitated proteins from 35S-methionine and 32P-labeled extracts were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In addition to the two virus-coded T-antigens, a third protein was observed in extracts of transformed cells. The molecular weight of this protein ranged from 50 K to 55 K, depending on the species of the cell. One-dimensional partial proteolysis peptide mapping indicated that the 55K and 90K proteins are not closely related. All SV40-transformed cells examined contained the 55K protein, but it could also be detected in uninfected and infected monkey cells with certain tumor sera. These results suggest that the 55 K protein is encoded by the host cell rather than the virus.",

Co-transfection of long L-DNA-fragments (Kpn 1, Sma I-cleaved) and Bam HI-fragments (group II enzyme) of M-DNA from different H. saimiri strains led to the isolation of eight recombinant viruses. Cleavage maps were constructed for each of these isolates using restriction endonucleases Aos I, Bam HI, Knp I, Sac II, Sal I, Sma I, and Xho I. In all recombinants, the terminal repetitive H-DNA stretches with adjacent external L-segments originated from one H. saimiri strain and the internal part of the L-region from the other parental strain. This method allows to generate recombinants without use of conditionally lethal mutants; the recombinant viruses may be useful in trying to localize coding sequences for viral proteins and to correlate certain genomic loci with oncogenic properties. There are base-sequence homologies between H. saimiri and H. ateles, but we found no cross-reaction between H. aotus type 2 and these viruses. There is also no relation to H.aotus type 1 and 3. Till now an in-vitro transformation of peripheral lymphocytes of primates was not possible with H. aotus 2. In experiments with marmosets it is not likely that this virus is oncogenic.

EBV capsid antigens (VCA), when examined with human EBV-VCA positive sera by indirect immunofluorescence. Titration of monkey and human sera on AGM-2206 and P3HR 1 cells revealed a partial crossreactivity between capsid antigens of the AGM-and the human EB-virus. Neither human nor monkey sera reacted with an EBNA-like antigen in AGM lymphoblasts. Cleavage patterns of AGM-EBV-DNA with the restriction endonucleases ECoR I and Hind III showed differences when compared to human EBV isolates from B 95-8, P3HR 1 and QIMR-WIL cells. Hybridization of labeled EBV DNA from B 95-8 cells to fragments of AGM-EBV DNA blotted onto nitrocellulose filters resulted in some hybridization to a small number of AGM-EBV DNA bands. In addition, the AGM-EBV transforms AGM B-lymphocytes very effectively. Thus, the isolation of a transforming, B-Iymphotropic EBV-like particle from an African green monkey, may permit investigations on primary replication sites, pathogenesis and possibly also on cofactors of EBVassociated oncogenesis. Previously Tupaia (tree shrew) herpesviruses (THV-1 and 2) have been described. THV-l had been isolated from degenerating lung tissue culture of Tupaia In contrast, THV-2 had been isolated by us from a malignant lymphoma centrocytic tumour cell culture of Tupaia. Isolation and characterisation of a third herpesvirus of Tupaia (THV-3), which was isolated from the tumour cell culture of a Hodgkin's sarcoma (Hodgkin's disease, Lymphocytic depletion type) of Tupaia, is the subject of this study. THV-3 was efficiently propagated on Tupaia embryonic or baby fibroblasts or kidney cell cultures. DNA isolated from THV-3 was investigated using the restriction endonuclease Eco RI. It was found that the Eco RI cleavage pattern of THV-3 DNA resulted in DNA fragments different from those of THV-1 and THV-2 DNAs. Although the resulting cleavage pattern of these three virus types are different from each other, most of the DNA fragments co migrate on agarose gels.",

It was found that the THV-2 induced hyperplasia of thymus if the animals were inoculated at the age of 4-15 days. The infectious virus was recovered from the cultured spleen of infected adult rabbits, when the animals were sacrificed 14 months after inoculation. The pattern of integration of adenovirus DNA have been analysed in adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12)-transformed hamster cells, in Ad 12-induced rat brain tumor cells and in adenovirus type 2 (Ad2)-infected human cells (1, 2, 3) . The cellular DNA's were isolated, cleaved with various restriction endonucleases and analysed by the Southern technique using [32P[ labeled viral DNA or specific fragments of viral DNA as hybridization probes. Viral DNA sequences in the bulk of cellular DNA were detected by autoradiography. The results of these experiments can be summarized as follows: 1. In Ad 12-transformed hamster cells and in Ad 12-induced rat brain tumor cells multiple copies of the intact Ad12 genome are colinearly integrated, perhaps predominantly in repetitive sequences of cellular DNA. Free viral DNA is not present in these cells. The sites of integration are different in individual cell lines. We are currently investigating the organization of these sites in detail. 2. In Ad 12-transformed hamster cells only early viral genes are expressed, in Ad 12-induced rat brain tumor cells the early and some of the late genes are expressed into mRNA. 3. Many, but not all of the 5'-CCGG-3' sequences in the integrated Ad12 DNA in transformed hamster cells are methylated at the internal C residue (4) . Virion DNA, however, is not methylated extensively (5). There is evidence that in transformed cells those regions of the genome which are expressed are less methylated than those which are not expressed. 4. In human cells productively infected with Ad2, a large number of viral genome copies are linked to cellular DNA early post-infection. There are only a few sites of recombination which perhaps lie in repetitive cellular DNA sequences. 5. We have isolated and started to characterize 18 morphological revertants of one of the Ad12-transformed hamster cell lines. Viral DNA sequences were lost from the genomes of these lines (6), although in general the patterns of integration are very stable with passage in culture and even in the animal. We have started to characterize the cellular sites of adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12) DNA integration in Ad 12-transformed hamster cells. The Ad 12-transformed hamster lines T637 and HA12/7 contain multiple copies of the entire viral genome. Most of the viral DNA molecules are integrated intact (Sutter et aI., Cell 14, 569, 1978) . The total DNA from the transformed cell lines was cleaved with several restriction endonucleases and analyzed by the Southern technique. In particular, restriction enzymes have been used which cleave Ad 12 DNA to a large number of fragments (Hinf I, Msp I). After cleavage with the Eco RI restriction enzyme, rather large DNA fragments (17-33 Kb) are generated which contain the terminal viral DNA fragments (Eco RI-A and C) plus cellular DNA.",

Viral DNA synthesis starts 6-8 h post-infection. Among the intracellular forms of viral DNA, a high molecular weight (hmw) form sedimenting in alkaline sucrose gradients at 40-90S has been characterized. The hmw form of Ad2 DNA represents viral DNA sequences covalently linked to cellular DNA. The integrated form of Ad2 DNA can be detected early after infection (2-4 h) and is possibly due to parental sequences. The integration event does not require viral DNA replication, but replication of the cells. -The integrated viral sequences were also analyzed using restriction endonucleases. After infection of human cells with Ad2, the nuclear DNA was isolated at 4, 6, 8, and 10 h postinfection, and the double stranded hmw DNA was selected by zone sedimentation and by chromatography on BND-cellulose. The DNA was then cleaved with the restriction endonucleases Bam HI or Eco RI, the fragments were separated on 0.6% agarose slab gels and analyzed by the Southern technique. Viral specific sequences were detected by hybridization with 32p nick translated Ad2 DNA or specific viral DNA fragments and autoradiography of the filters. -Th~ results demonstrate viral DNA fragments in a limited number of bands in molecular weight regions higher than the Bam HI-A virion DNA fragment (mol. wt. 8.8 x 10 6 ).

The proteins synthesized in mutant-infected cells at 36 DC and 40 DC were analyzed by SDS-PAGE: a protein pattern typical for echovirus 12 was observed, except that a band co migrating with VP4 was missing in the 40 DC extracts. This demonstrates that the viral 35 S RNA is capable to serve as messenger. To test the hypothesis that ts 141 and ts 216 are defective in maturation extracts from cells infected at 36 DC and 40 DC with these mutants were submitted to sucrose gradient centrifugation: neither intact virions sedimenting with 156S nor 80S and 13-14S particles, the presumptive precursors of assembly, were detected in extracts from cells infected at 40 DC; all three types of particles were present in the 36 DC extracts.

EGGERS Strain Barty, a mouse-pathogenic echovirus 9 and strain Hill, the apathogenic prototype of echovirus 9 were characterized and compared in biological and biochemical terms. Both strains replicate in GMK cells but not in HeLa or KB cells. The Barty virus forms plaques under an agar-overlay, whereas plaque formation of the Hill virus is blocked under these conditions; under an agarose-overlay, however, both strains form plaques. Infectivity of the Hill strain is more thermolabile in vitro than that of Barty. Barty virion particles sediment in a sucrose gradient with 156S -as observed with all other picornaviruses investigated so far -, whereas the particles of the Hill strain form fast sedimenting aggregates under the same experimental conditions. Isoelectric focussing of the virion particles revealed that Barty virus exists essentially in one conformation with a characteristic IEP; purified virions of the Hill strain, however, were found to represent a mixture of particles with various IEP's. The protein patterns of the two strains in SDS-PAGE being mostly similar, showed a characteristic difference: VP 1 of Barty is a double band, whereas Hill contains a single band in a position just between the two VPl bands of Barty. To get an idea about the relevance of the biochemical properties for pathogenicity, we started to characterize an echovirus 9 field strain, isolated in our laboratory, and three variants of the Hill strain which had acquired the capacity fo form plaques under agar. The field strain apparently resembles closely the Barty strain; the Hill variants have the protein composition of the parent, but, interestingly, they resemble in other regards, e.g. behaviour in sucrose gradients, the Barty strain. During an outbreak of infections on a maternity ward in October 1978 a highly pathogenic enterovirus was isolated. By cross-neutralization tests and neutralization kinetics it has been identified as an echovirus 11 prime strain. In search for markers of pathogenicity we compared prime and prototype strain by some biological and biochemical parameters. Both strains are nonpathogenic for newborn mice. Both strains form plaques under an agarose overlay, whereas under agar only Porz virus is plaque-forming. In single cycle growth curves the prototype is slightly delayed as compared to Porz virus and the final virus yield of the prototype is 10 times lower. The adsorption kinetics of both strains to GMK cells is very similar as measured by infectivity. In SDS-PAGE the VP3 of Porz and prototype virus differs markedly. According to first results also differences are found in VP 1 as revealed by proteolytic digestion of the isolated bands and subsequent SDS-PAGE. Isoelectric focussing, however, showed no differences between both viruses. Porz virus is stable under saccharose gradient centrifugation in low salt concentration, whereas the prototype no longer forms a band under these conditions (aggregates ?). In October 1978, a 6 day-old child became iII on a maternity ward with clinical signs of a speticaemia and died. Subsequently, 6 additional children suffered from aseptic meningitis (birth dates: Sept. 16; Oct. 1; 3; 5; 8; 9), 5 of them within the first 10 days after birth, one child 4 weeks old. From these 6 children all of whom required intensive care, virus was isolated at various times of disease and from various sites (CSF, pharynx, rectum). A total of 25 isolates was recovered. The agent was difficult to type, but in cross-neutralization tests it turned out to be a prime strain of echovirus 11. Though further environmental investigations in 49 people yielded no additional isolate, the path of infection could be reconstructed by clinical and serological data. Determination of neutralizing antibodies of the IgM and IgG class was helpful to identify recent infections, and to obtain information on the type specifity of the IgM reaction. A laboratory infection with the agent permitted to collect detailed virological and serological data.",

This mutant was characterized by biochemical and biological tests. The results show that at the nonpermissive temperature RNA and protein synthesis are normal except for hemagglutinin. No intact virus particles are assembled. Although the NS protein is synthesized early in the replication cycle, the findings presented suggest that at least one of its function is a late one. Two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants and one ts recombinant of fowl plague virus were isolated and each was chosen to have a ts lesion in the gene coding for the NS protein on the basis of complementation and recombination tests with 7 groups of previously characterized ts mutants. These ts clones synthesized an NS protein which had an altered migration on PAGE in 25% SDS-urea gels. Revertant clones from one mutant had an NS protein which differed in migration from the original wild type parent and from the ts mutant. The second mutant also had a P2 protein with altered migration on PAGE. The fact that the parental virus for these ts clones was a recombinant heterozygous for RNA segments 3 and 6 and possessed a recombinant segment 5 may have led to the ready isolation of 3 clones with a ts lesion in the NS segment. With the aid of these mutants it should be possible to get more information concerning the function of the NS protein.",

Chemically induced mutants of the apathogenic NOV strains La Sota and Ulster have been isolated that exhibit an altered susceptibility of glycoprotein F to proteolytic cleavage. Cleavage of glycoprotein HN is not altered with the mutants. Fingerprint analysis of the tryptic pep tides indicates that the mutation resulted in an altered primary structure of glycoprotein F. With the other viral proteins no differences were found between mutants and wild type viruses. In contrast to the wild types, the precursor Fo is activated by proteolytic cleavage, when the mutants are grown in MDBK and BHK21 cells. The mutants are, therefore, able to undergo multiple cycle replication in cells that are permissive for the wild types. This increase in host range at the cellular level is paralleled with one mutant by an increase in pathogenicity for the chick embryo. These observations support the concept that the susceptibility of the glycoproteins to proteolytic cleavage is an important determinant for the pathogenicity of this virus. On the whole 45 acute and convalescent serum samples from patients were tested in parallel for IgG-and IgM-antibodies to mumps virus by the ELISA, in addition 42 acute sera were tested for IgM-antibodies. In 1 patients sera the development of IgG-and IgMantibodies before, during and up to 14 months after a mumps virus infection was controlled.

The technique has been used for determining the concentration and quality of rubella antibodies in humans present at different time intervals after rubella infection. It was found that the quality of antibodies changes from low quality to high quality antibodies within 60-80 days after onset of rubella rash. Therefore, determining of the quality of rubella antibody molecules can be utilized for discriminating between recent and past rubella infection. Since it was found that the difference of quality of antibodies is not due to the relative concentration of IgM and IgG antibodies, this discrimination is independent from the presence or absence of rubella IgM antibodies. The envelope glycoprotein E1 and the precursor glycoprotein p62, from which the envelope glycoproteins E2 and E3 are derived, occur in infected cells in two different antigenic forms. One of them is \"mature\" and has a conformation corresponding to that of the glycoproteins in the SFV envelope. The other one is \"immature\" and converted into the final form by modification which includes glycosylating processes. The final conformation remains stable during release of virus and is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds. Reductive cleavage of these bridges alters physical and immunological properties of E1 and E2 causing loss of infectivity and of hemagglutinating activity of the virion. A reformation of disulfide bonds at original positions is possible, if the proteins remain in the membrane. It was not observed after dissociation of virus by detergents. The findings indicate that the conformation of the glycoproteins achieved due to a proper composition of the carbohydrate side chains, is very important for their correct transport to a defined target and thus for virus release. The biological functions of the virus particle similarly depend on the tertiary structure of the membrane constituents, while the carbohydrate side chains appeared to be without direct influence.",

MULLER and G. STEGER Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the causative agent of a highly contagious disease of young chickens (Gumboro disease) with severe necrotic lesions in the bursa of Fabricius. We could show that the genome of IBDV consists of two segments of doublestranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) with molecular weights of 2.2 x 10 6 daltons. For comparative purposes, infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPNV) a virus of salmonids also containing a bisegmented dsRNA -was included in our studies. The dsRNAs of both virus types are very similar with respect to their moecular weights, GC-contents and melting behaviours. In view of their prominent structural characteristics of the genome it seems justified to place both of these viruses into a separate taxonomic group. Whilst testing the susceptibility of mink lung cells to several strains of CMV and VZV, it was found in many cases that plaques developed and cell lysis occurred 3-4 days after infection. Detailed analysis showed that this CPE was not due to CMV or VZV but to an infectious agent which has the following properties. This new agent grows lytic ally on mink lung cells, swine, bovine and lamb kidney, and lamb testicular cells. It grows without producing morphological changes and with a low titre on human fibroblasts. The doublestranded DNA of the agent sedimented closely to HSV DNA marker in velocity gradients in neutral sucrose and has a buoyant density of 1.684 g/ml-1 in CsC!. The DNA from different isolates when cleaved with 19 different restriction enzymes, for any of them gave very similar patterns. These patterns were not like those of any previously analysed animal virus. Protein analysis showed no similarities between these isolates and other known viruses. An analysis of 1.292 human sera samples showed that 2% had a NT titre of 1: 640-1: 2560, and the agent has been directly isolated from a patient with acute swelling of the parotid gland. Our results demonstrate that the majority of the CMV and VZV stocks, and fresh isolates contain this unknown agent the presence of which can be easily screened for on mink lung cells.",

It could be shown that individual samples differed with respect to buoyant density, sedimentation behaviour and polypeptide composition of the isolated particles. HA V particles banding at 1.34 glml in CsCl and sedimenting with 160 S revealed a spectrum of 4 polypeptides comparable to the pattern reported for enteroviruses. Two of these polypeptides, however were either completely absent or present only in trace amounts in particles banding around 1.33 glml and sedimenting with less than 160 S. Yet, the latter particles contained at least one additional polypeptide with a molecular weight of between 43000 and 50000. The significance of these findings with respect to antigenicity and infectivity of individual HA V samples is discussed. If further studies indicate that a considerable number of IgM-anti-HBc positive donors transmit hepatitis B to recipients, this relatively low percentage of positive donors (about 0.5%) can be discarded of without creating a blood supply problem. Only some of the so-called \"healthy\" HBeAg negative carriers of HBsAg which are usually not infectious are IgM-anti-HBc positive (41 of 123 = 33%), whereas most patients with chronic aggressive hepatitis show this marker (11 of 12 = 92%).

WINNACKER Although the general pattern of Adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) DNA replication is well understood (1), the functional organization of this process has remained elusive. In order to approach this problem, a soluble system has been developed which is able to replicate exogenously added Ad2 DNA. The protein extract with the desired specificity is obtained by low-salt extraction of nuclei isolated between 8-12 h. p.i. of Ad2 infected HeLa cells. The most favorable substrate at protein concentrations of 5-10 mg/ml is the virion derived protein/DNA complex. Only background synthesis was observed in the absence of viral DNA, in the presence of viral DNA without the terminal protein and in the absence of ATP. The product synthesized under optimal conditions for DNA synthesis was characterized through sedimentation analysis, electron microscopy (kindly performed by Dr. H.Delius, Heidelberg) and restriction enzyme digestion. The specificity of the system was attested to by the presence of the terminal protein on the 5 ' -termini of newly initiated DNA strands. Studies have been initiated on the properties of extracts derived from mutant virus infected cells, on the protein composition of the extract, the role of host factors as well as 5'-5' Dinucleoside tetraphosphates in the initiation process.

Using this rapid approach we could indeed demonstrate the presence of recombinant DNA fragments in mixed infections with the wildtypes 2 and 5. Since the recombination frequencies increase from 5% in the first to over 30% in subsequent mixed infections, we have been able to isolate single recombinant virus clones. An analysis of the crossover events on the nucleic acid as well as on the protein level is in progress.",

For analysis of histones 3H-lysine-labelled proteins of lysates of unfractionated cells and of chromatin preparations were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and subsequent fluorography. Comparison of the fluorograms from the various pulses postinfection suggested that 3H_ lysine incorporation into histones exhibited no major variations concurrent to the changes of host cell DNA synthesis. In contrast, herpes simplex virus type I was found to progressively extinguish histone synthesis in the course of the cellular infection.

Thus the cytomegalovirus-genome has a significantly higher molecular weight than the DNA-molecules of all other known herpesviruses. We found two new herpesviruses, Herpesvirus aotus type 1 and type 3 (H. aotus 1 and 3), possessing \"supergiant\" DNA-molecules also. Intact H. aotus 1 and 3 DNA shows a density of 1.714 glml after analytical centrifugation in CsCI gradients, corresponding to an average G + Ccontent of 55%. Density centrifugation of fragmented DNA reveals an intramolecular density heterogeneity; about 25% of DNA fragments have about 49% G + C, while the majority of the sequences band at the position of 57% G + C DNA. Sedimentation coefficient (ca. 65S) and contour length (ca. 22 PM 2 units) of H. aotus 1 and 3 DNA indicate about 143-148 md. When single strands of H. aotus 3 were examined in the electron microscope, foldback structures became apparent which allow to conclude on the presence of inverted repetitive sequences. The genomes consist of a long (UL = 105 md) and a short (Us = 19 md) unique region, flanked at both sides by inverted repetitive sequences of 1.5 md and 2.4 md, respectively. Thus the general plan of those genomes is the same as in human cytomegalovirus. Reassociationkinetics, T m-determination of heteroduplexmolecules and comparative cleavages with a number of restriction-endonucleases (Eeo RI, Kpn I, Hind III, Sac II, Sal I, Sma I, Xba I) indicate a high degree of base-sequencehomology between H. aotus 1 and 3. A certain degree of base-sequence-homology was found by cross-hybridisation between DNA of H. aotus 1 and 3 and human cytomegalovirus. The susceptibility of adult Tupaia belangeri (tree shrew) to infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) was investigated. Adult animals were inoculated intra peritoneally with different HSV 1 or 2 (10 5 -10 6 plaque forming units per animal). All HSV strains had a killing effect irrespective of the age of the animals with the exception of HSV-2, strain HG-52. The highest pathogenicity of HSV 1 and 2 in theses animals was expressed by the predominant clinical picture of a lethal herpetic hepatitis. The reaction of the juvenile Tupaia to infection with temperature-sensitive mutants of HSV was also investigated. Information concerning this reaction is important because the physiological body temperature of the tupaia varies from 36\u00b0C at night to more than 41 \u00b0C during daytime. It was found that juvenile tupaia completely survived an infection with temperature-sensitive mutants of HSV-2 HG-52. Although these infections were not lethal, they induced a protection against a second infection of a lethal dose of wild type HSV regardless of type and strain. Infectious HSV was recovered from the spinal cord of those animals which had survived the viral infection at low dosis. This indicates that HSV resided in a latent state in Tupaia. The genomes of the recovered viruses were also compared to the viral DNA of the inoculated virus using restriction endonucleases.",

On the other hand, to achieve useful results for the physician, it is necessary to combine all clinical data of one individual patient with all laboratory results, in order to obtain an interpretation. To accomplish these requirements, we developed a data processing system for clinical virology with the following concept: 1. All personal of the Institute should be able to handle the system without any special knowledge. 2. Using a dialogue-system, one should be able to give the informations into the computer in clear text or in abbreviations of any variable length of the clear text. Code numbers should be avoided as far as possible. 3. All data of patients are stored indefinitly, remaining available for immediate access and integration with the data of a new submission of the same patient. 4. According to the input of the submissions, the system prints detailed working instructions for the different working places of the laboratory, mentioning the old titers or results from the patient, in order to facilitate the course of the examination. 5. After the input of the results, the system prints a diagnostic survey with all results and clinical data including the data, diagnoses and remarks of the old submissions. This enables the virologist to give a preformed interpretation of the results, a virological diagnosis or remark. 6. Upon request, the system gives a detailed letter to the doctor with the old and new data including a virological interpretation in form of a diagnosis with additional remarks.",

ViroL, in press). -Anti-,u coated flat-bottomed microtiter plates were incubated with dilutions of patient serum and later with HBcAg extracted from human liver. After another incubation with peroxidase coupled anti-HBc, orthophenylenediamine was added and the optical density (O.D.) measured. -The specificity of the test was proved by testing IgM-and IgG fractions of sucrose gradients from sera of patients with fresh hepatitis B and by testing rheumatoid factor positive sera. The test proved to be highly sensitive.In sera of patients with fresh hepatitis B IgM-anti-HBc could be demonstrated in dilutions up to 10-'. -Six months after onset of hepatitis, IgM-anti-HBc could be demonstrated in 82% of the tested patient sera. In the sera of 11 of 12 patients with histologically proved chronic active hepatitis and in 96% of 27 HBeAg-positive carriers of HBsAg, IgM-anti-HBc could be demonstrated. The usefulness of the IgM-anti-HBc test as a diagnostic parameter is restricted by the high prevalence of IgM-anti-HBc in chronic hepatitis B infection. The demonstration of IgM anti-HBc in chronic hepatits over a period of several years may be explained by an immunological inductive persistence of HBcAg. Max von Pettenkofer-Institut, Ludwig Maximilians-Universitat, 8000 Miinchen, FRG Significance of IgM-Anti-HBc for Blood Donor Screening G.G. FROSNER, M. ROGGENDORF, F. DEINHARDT, B. BAYERL, R. SCHEID, and R. ZACHOV AL According to Hoofnagle and coworkers (New EngL].Med. 298, 1579Med. 298,  , 1978 HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive blood may be infectious for hepatitis B. This raises the question whether anti-HBc positive blood should not be used for blood transfusion. 61 of 1966 (3%) Bavarian blood donors investigated here were anti-HBc positive and HBsAg and anti-HBs negative. IgM-anti-HBc is present during the convalescent stage of acute hepatitis B and usually also in patients who have developed HBsAg positive chronic liver disease after acute hepatitis B. Therefore it may be a better indicator for infectivity of sera than determination of total anti-HBc (IgG and IgM). The determination of anti-HBc of the IgM -class diminished considerably the number of potentially infectious blood donors: only 2 of 61 anti-HBc positive blood donors (one was also anti-HBe positive) showed IgM-anti-HBc. Both donors had relatively low anti-HBc titers (50% inhibition titer) (IgG and IgM) of < 1: 100 measured by radioimmunoassay (Corab, Abbott). In addition, 7 of 63 anti-HBc and anti-HBs positive donors were also IgM-anti-HBc positive.",

Electron microscopy of purified T A V revealed the presence of typical adenovirus particles with a capsid diameter of about 72 nm. The host range study revealed that Tupaia kidney cells are the cells of choice for the efficient propagation and the plaque assay of T A V. This cell clone was used for the continued propagation of T A V. The buoyant density of TA V DNA was 1.706 g/ml-1 as determined by isopycnic CsCI centrifugation. Analysis of TA V DNA by different restriction endonuclease revealed specific DNA pattern. The molecular weight of the viral DNA was found to be 21.5 x 10 6 daltons. T A V hemagglutinated rat and human O-type erythrocytes. One line of identity between human adenovirus and T A V was found by immunodiffusion test. T A V immortalised some mammalian cells. The characterisation of these immortalised cells and an extensive study of the oncogenicity of T A V in vitro and in vivo is required for the final classification of T A V as an oncogenic adenovirus. lInstitut fur Med.

MEIER-EWERTThe receptor-destroying activity of influenza C virus (JHB/1/66) was investigated by adsorption onto and elution from chicken erythrocytes. -It was found, that viruses grown in CEF-cells showed more or less the same time course of elution, regardless whether gp I was converted to gp II by trypsin or not. -After elution, the polypeptide pattern of intact virus was found in the supernatant. -When the virus was pretreated for 30 min at 50\u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C the binding capacity to erythrocytes could be increased. -Pretreatment of the virus for 30 min at 49 DC reduced the amount of elutable virus to 50% of the controls.Abteilung Virologie, Institut fiir Med.

STAUCH 2 Simultaneous application of influenza virus and polyoma virus to newborn Wistar rats resulted in significant reduction of tumor rates as compared to controls given polyoma virus, only. This antioncogenic activity (AOA) could be established for two influenza A strains (A/PR 8 and A/Hongkong) . The AOA was comparable under the different application schedules used: injection of polyo ma and influenza virus on different sites or as a combined vaccine. It was found that the growth of brain tumors was suppressed to a similar degree as that of renal sarcomas. Ether treatment of influenza virus, tested on strain A/PR 8, did not decrease its antioncogenic potential. In one experiment, however, only a significant reduction of brain tumors was seen, while the rate of renal sarcomas did not differ significantly from that of controls.Bayerische Landesimpfanstalt, 8000 Munchen, FRG; 1. Augenklinik der Universitat, 1000 Wien, Austria Experimental and Clinical Studies of the Virostatic Agent Adenin-Arabinoside-Monophosphate H . STICKL, G. WERNER, and L. EGERER Adenin-Arabinoside (Ara-A) acts virostatic against several DNA-viruses. The low solubility of the compound poses certain problems. The monophosphate of Ara-A, Ara-AMP, is 50-times more soluble. It is highly effective in experimental encephalitis with herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus in mice and in rabbits. Special emphasis was laid upon the question, if in an successfully treated experimental encephalitis any morphological damage or late effects can be seen in the brain. The brains of mice were examined six weeks after infection with vaccinia virus strain Ma 1 and subsequent treatment with Ara-AMP (100 mg /kg) . The histology revealed minor meningeal irritation (cellular infiltration of the meninges and the meningeal vessels) in 1/3 of the cases. In 2/3 of the animals the histology was normal. In herpetic keratitis the combined treatment of debridement of the epithelial lesion and subsequent application of Ara-AMP ointment were highly successful. In Interferon (IF) treated cells the activity of the synthetase of an oligonucleotide, with the structure pppA2'p5'A2' p5'A, is strongly increased (1). This nucleotide activates",

The binding was shown to be partly reversible by free sialic and sialyl-lactose indicating that the ceramide of G. might not be essential for the ligand-I. interaction (2). Presently we compared the ability of G. and G.-derived sialo-oligosaccharide to inhibit the antiviral capacity of interferon.The results show: 1. The infection of rabbit kidney culture cells by VSV is not influenced by pretreatment of cells or virus with sialo-conjugates. 2. Mono-sialo-gangliotetraitol, the reduced sugar moiety of G. GGtet 1 (IP Neu-Ac-GgOse4-Cer) inhibits interferon antiviral action although to a lesser degree than parent G. A stronger inhibition is achieved with a dimere form of the lipid-free sialo-sugar biz (monosialo-gangliotetraityl) amine, that may possibly provide two interferon binding sites. Anti herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSVl) antibody titers of sera from adult donors were determined by the complement fixation (CF), the micro neutralization and the ELISA test. The most sensitive method for antibody determination was the ELISA while the CF assay and the micro neutralization assay were considerably less sensitive. Although antibody titers obtained with these three methods did not correlate very weI!, it may be concluded that ELISA antibody titers were up to 40 fold higher than neutralizing antibody titers and up to 100 fold higher than CF antibody titers. Due to the higher sensitivity of ELISA only 3 of 36 blood donors tested proved to be seronegative with this assay while 9 donors of the same group were found seronegative with the micro neutralization assay. In vitro stimulation of peripheral lymphocytes with a partially purified HSVI particle antigen was achieved for all ELISA seropositive donors, including those lacking neutralizing antibody",
