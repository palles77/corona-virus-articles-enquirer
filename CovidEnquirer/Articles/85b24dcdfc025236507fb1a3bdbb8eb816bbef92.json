            "text": "Carbonic anhydrases (CA) are a family of zinc metalloenzymes, which catalyze reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in order to maintain pH balance in living organisms. CAIX is a transmembrane glycoprotein with molecular weight of 54/58kDa. Structurally, CAIX consists of four domains: an N-terminal proteoglycan-like domain (PG) (aa 53-111), a CA catalytic domain (CA) (aa 135 -391), a transmembrane helical segment (aa 415-434), and a short intracytoplasmic tail (aa 434-459). In hypoxic conditions, the CAIX gene is directly activated at the transcriptional level by hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1, leading to transport of protons to the extracellular medium and lowering of pH. 1 Thus, CAIX expression can be regarded as a surrogate marker for hypoxia in various tumors. 2 The resulting acidification of the tumor microenvironment by CA activity and the keratin sulfate unit in the O-linked glycan structure in the PG domain of CAIX are presumed to play an important role in the processes of cell adhesion and tumor progression. 3 CAIX is considered a tumor-associated antigen and its overexpression is found among several solid tumor types, particularly in clear cell type renal cell carcinomas (RCC) 4 as well as carcinomas of several histologic types including ovarian, breast, esophageal, bladder, colon, non-small cell lung, dysplasia of the cervix and others. 5 CAIX expression has been suggested to serve as a marker for cancer diagnosis and early detection of carcinogenesis 6 ; it is also a prognostic marker for favorable response in interleukin (IL)-2-treated patients of melanoma and kidney cancer, leading to high response rates and low toxicity. 7 Immunostaining and western blot studies have shown that a high level of CAIX expression is restricted to the majority of primary RCC (clear cell type with granular or spindle cell, papillary type of chromophilic cell and collecting duct except for chromphobic cell), cystic RCCs, and metastatic RCCs but is not observed in normal kidney tissues, benign epithelial cystic lesions, or non-renal cell clear cell adenocarcinoma. 2, 6 RCC is one of two immunogenic tumor types, besides melanoma, that exhibits evidence of spontaneous regression of metastatic lesions after nephrectomy 8 and of being responsive to immunomodulating therapies such as cancer vaccines and IL-2. 9 Adoptive T cell therapy for metastatic melanoma and RCC patients using ex vivo expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has shown some success. 10 Recently, T-cell receptor (TCR)-modified T cells (TCR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 chains) were also used to provide an effective tumor targeting T-cell repertoire. 11 However, post-targeting antitumor activity can be hampered by deficiencies that involve downregulation at all levels of the major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted antigen presentation machinery, 12 induced anergy due to the loss of expression of costimulatory molecules on the tumor 13 as well as shedding of molecules and secretion of cytokines with immunosuppressive activity by tumors. 14, 15 Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a tumor-associated antigen and marker of hypoxia that is overexpressed on > 90% of clear-cell type renal cell carcinoma (RCC) but not on neighboring normal kidney tissue. Here, we report on the construction of two chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that utilize a carbonic anhydrase (CA) domain mapped, human single chain antibody (scFv G36) as a targeting moiety but differ in their capacity to provide costimulatory signaling for optimal T cell proliferation and tumor cell killing. The resulting anti-CAIX CARs were expressed on human primary T cells via lentivirus transduction. CAR-transduced T cells (CART cells) expressing secondgeneration G36-CD28-TCR\u03b6 exhibited more potent in vitro antitumor effects on CAIX + RCC cells than first-generation G36-CD8-TCR\u03b6 including cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, proliferation, and clonal expansion. Adoptive G36-CD28-TCR\u03b6 CART cell therapy combined with high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 injection also lead to superior regression of established RCC in nude mice with evidence of tumor cell apoptosis and tissue necrosis. These results suggest that the fully human G36-CD28-TCR\u03b6 CARs should provide substantial improvements over first-generation mouse anti-CAIX CARs in clinical use through reduced human anti-mouse antibody responses against the targeting scFv and administration of lower doses of T cells during CART cell therapy of CAIX + RCC.",

In one example, murine mAbG250, which recognizes the PG domain on CAIX was used to construct a first-generation single-chain antibody chimeric receptor scFv(G250)-CD4-Fc\u03b5RI\u03b3 which was then retrovirus transduced and expressed on autologous T cells for adoptive immunotherapy in conjunction with low-dose IL-2 treatment in three metastatic RCC patients. However, two out of the three patients suffered from liver toxicity, necessitating lower CART dosing and pretreatment with CAIX monoclonal antibody G250 to prevent liver toxicities. 17 Thus, improvement in both safety and efficacy is required for this cellular therapy against RCC to be moved into further clinical trials.",

            "text": "Recently, the focus of CAR designs has shifted to incorporation of endodomains from T cell costimulatory molecules, such as CD28, 4-1BB, and OX40, to overcome problems with inefficient effector function and anergic status of antitumor CART cells. Incorporation of CD28 costimulatory molecule into CARs generates CART cells with superior antitumor activities including tumor-induced proliferation, cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, clonal expansion, and tumor regression in animal tumor models. Two encouraging preclinical findings have established the advantages of CART therapy over traditional adoptive T cell therapy. First, injection of CART cells required as little as 1 week for tumor regression/eradication in leukemia 18 and metastistic cancer 19 without IL-2, and for established tumors in mice with IL-2. 20 Second, in vivo persistence of CART cells in hosts after treatment was strong and antitumor activity was maximized. CART cells incorporating CD137 costimulatory molecule could be detected for at least 6 months in NOD-SCID-\u03b22 \u2212/\u2212 mouse bearing human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 18 In addition, in a recent clinical trial, complete remission and long-term survival of effector memory T cells was observed in two out of three patients with advanced chemotherapy-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had received adoptive immunotherapy using second-generation CAR (4-1BB) targeting CD19, illustrating successful translation of such a therapeutic approach. 21 Similarly, second-generation CD28-encoded CARs targeting CD19 have shown promising results in CLL, indolent B-cell lymphoma, and ALL. 22 Here, we characterize the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of five CAIX-specific scFv antibodies isolated from a human phage display library. The lead scFv (G36) was chosen for incorporation into two CAR constructs: first-generation scFv-CD8-TCR\u03b6 (CD8z) and second-generation scFv-CD28-TCR\u03b6 (CD28z). We compared the in vitro antitumor responses of these two types of scFvG36-retargeted CART cells and show superiority of G36-CD28z CART cells by multiple parameters. In conjunction with high-dose IL-2 injection, G36-CD28z CART cells showed marked tumor regression in nude mice bearing subcutaneous established CAIX + RCC. In addition, in situ distribution of G36-CD28z CART cells within tumors of these mice provide evidence of the enhanced antitumor activity.",

To test for anti-CAIX mAb-mediated ADCC, the scFvs were converted to scFv-Fc (hIgG1) minibodies. 23 We found that all scFv-Fcs exhibited antigen-specific tumor lysis. For tumor cell line sk-rc-09 with high CAIX + expression, specific lysis ranged from 40 to 57% and for sk-rc-52 with moderate CAIX + expression, specific lysis ranged from 46 to 60%, with background of lysis of < 5% for the CAIX \u2212 tumor cell line sk-rc-59. For negative control scFv-Fcs such as anti-CXCR4 48-Fc 23 and anti-SARS 11A-Fc, 24 only background levels of cell lysis were seen ( Figure 1 ).

Concentrated lentivirus supernatants were used to infect human primary T cells in the presence of cationic reagent diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran) as it increased the transduction rate of 1.5-2\u00d7-fold as compared with polybrene (data not shown). The transduction rate of primary T cells ranged , is composed of a specific anti-CAIX scFv that is coupled to truncated human CD8\u03b1 extracellular and hinge domains, transmembrane (TM), and intracellular (IC) regions, then to the signaling domain of human TCR\u03b6. The second-generation CAR, scFv-CD28-TCR\u03b6 (CD28 CAR), contains anti-CAIX scFv fused with human CD28 extracellular, TM, and intracellular signaling domain to TCR\u03b6. Both anti-CAIX CARs were cloned into a bicistronic selfinactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector with expression driven by an internal eF1\u03b1 promoter. The CAR control construct contains an irrelevant anti-HIV CCR5 specific A8 scFv substitution. (b) FACS analysis: Reporter gene ZsGreen was used to quantitate primary T cell transduction efficiency by the lentiviral CAR constructs. In addition, anti-CAIX scFv CARs were stained with CAIX-Fc fusion protein and C9-tag (TETSQVAPA) was stained with 1D4 antibody. Untransduced activated T-cells, LAK only were served as unstained cell control (i) or stained with second antibody ((ii) PE-anti-human IgG and (iii) APC-anti-mouse IgG) were used as staining controls. (c) Western blot: molecular sizes of monomer/dimer structures of anti-CAIX (clone G36) CD28 and anti-CCR5 (clone A8) CD28 CARs, as well as endogenous TCR\u03b6 chain of untransduced T cells were indicated. ZsGreen expression in circa 25% by primary CART cells following lentivirus transduction is shown in Figure 2b , left column. CAIX-Fc fusion protein can bind to the G36-CD8z and -CD28z CART cells but not to control A8-CD28z CART cells (Figure 2b , middle column). C9-tag expression was only detected at circa one-third the level of the CAIX-Fc protein (Figure 2b , right column), which is likely related to the finding that mAb 1D4 preferentially recognizes the rhodopsin nonapeptide C9 when presented as a carboxy-terminal versus internal polypeptide sequence (data not shown). Transduced cells that were cultured in vitro for 6 weeks maintained their expression of ZsGreen. On western blot under reducing conditions, G36 and A8 CD28z CARs migrated with a molecular weight of circa 53kD whereas endogenous TCR\u03b6 was 16 kDa. G36-CD8z CAR migrated with a molecular weight of circa 48 kD. Under nonreducing conditions, these two CD28z CARs formed homodimers (Figure 2c , data of CD8z CAR not shown).",

As seen in Figure 3a , after incubation with CAIX + sk-rc-52 cells overnight, only low levels of type I cytokines IL-2, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and IL-17 secretion were seen with control A8 CD28z CART cells or LAK cells alone. In contrast, both first-and second-generation G36 expressing CART cells showed elevated levels of cytokine secretion with second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells secreting higher amounts of type I cytokines, which reflects their higher activation status compared to first-generation G36-CD8z CART cells. Specifically, G36-CD28z CART cells secreted 6.5\u00d7, 2.3\u00d7, and 4\u00d7 more IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17, respectively than G36-CD8z CART cells.

All anti-CAIX mAbs showed potent ADCC activity suggesting that the CAIX epitope(s) are properly oriented with respect to the plasma membrane for Fc\u03b3R-mediated killing to occur. Antibody scFvG36 was chosen for targeting the anti-CAIX CARs based on its killing activity, good expression levels, and ability to mediate CAIX internalization. 23 We constructed self-inactivating lentiviral vectors expressing firstand second-generation fully human G36 CARs and performed extensive in vitro comparisons of the two. We are also the first to report on the in vivo antitumor activity of G36 CART cells against RCC. Mice from experiments reported in Figure 5 (experiment 1, n = 7 and experiment 2, n = 8) were scored for response at day 10. Partial response is defined as the regression of tumor to smaller than 30% volume of control tumor (same T-cell treatment in the same mouse bearing left flank of skrc-52 and right flank of control tumor sk-rc-59).

            "text": "Consistent with previous reports with CARs containing costimulatory signaling motifs, second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells possessed superior effector functions compared with first-generation G36-CD8z CART cells in all in vitro assays including IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-17 cytokine secretion (Figure 3a) , cytolytic activity ( Figure  3b,c) , proliferation (Figure 4a) , and clonal expansion (Figure 4b ). IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 have been shown to promote antitumor activity of CD8 + T cells and are likely involved in the tumorocidal activity that was observed in vivo. However, these same cytokines have also been implicated in the recruitment of NK cells to tumors. 26, 27 The role of IL-17 in antitumor immunity is controversial 28 and this cytokine may have different functions depending on the tumor type and stage. 19, 29 IL-17 secreting CD8 + T cells have been shown to have enhanced antitumor immunity in vivo 30 and a mechanistic link between IL-17 and NK activity has been recently demonstrated. 29 Second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells also showed superior activity in vivo in inhibiting CAIX + tumor cell growth compared to irrelevant CART or LAK cells ( Figure 5) . In situ studies provided evidence of tumor cell apoptosis (Figure 6b ) as well as the presence of granzyme B + T cells and tumor necrosis (Figure 6c ). The greater in vivo effector functions mediated by G36-CD28z CART cells may be due to several mechanisms. First, G36-CD28z CART cells showed a greater capacity to proliferate on repeated contact with CAIX + tumor cells than did G36-CD8z CART cells (Figure 4b ). They showed this same augmented capacity to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 on recontact with CAIX + tumor cells (Table 1) . Second, in addition to enhanced proinflammatory cytokine secretion, the G36-CD28z CART cells may be more resistant to activation-induced cell death resulting from tumor antigen contact than with G36-CD8z CART that receive T-cell receptor (signal 1)-only stimulation. 31 This activation-induced cell death resistance is due to upregulation of expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as cFLIP, bcl-xL, and bcl-2. 32 The CD28 cytoplasmic domain can also serve to enhance cellular activation through protein kinase C-\u03b8-mediated signaling. 33 Third, G36-CD28z CART cells may be better protected from suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their inhibitory cytokine, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, due to the enhanced NF-\u03baB activation through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathway. 34 Indeed, expansion of Tregs was found to be significantly higher in DC-vaccination and cytokine therapy nonresponders than in responding patients. 35 These resistances provide extra benefits for G36-CD28z CART immunotherapy.",

            "text": "To avoid the development of unwanted immunogenic response following the introduction of CAR-specific antibodies during adoptive transfer using chimeric TCR receptors, the use of a humanized or a human scFv had been suggested. 36 It has been shown that the scFv component of the CAR derived from murine monoclonal antibody MOv18 resulted in detectable levels of human antimouse antibodies (HAMA). 37 HAMA might inhibit redirected T cell function by blocking the interaction between CAR and target antigen. 38 The immunogenicity of CARs can restrict the duration of treatment and thus limit the overall antitumor effect. Indeed, when murine anti-CAIX mAb G250 was used as a first-generation CAR in a RCC clinical trial both anti-idiotypic antibodies and anti-CAR cell-mediated immunity to the scFv component developed that neutralized and resulted in CART cell clearance. 36 In addition, so-called \"on-target\" liver toxicity cells was observed that was attributed to CAIX expression on bile duct epithelial cells. 17 Indeed, the expression of CAIX on normal tissues by immunohistochemical staining has been documented using murine anti-CAIX mAbs M75 and G250 that are directed to the N-terminal PG domain. This staining is largely restricted to the apical surface of cells of the stomach and bile duct mucosa 39, 40 and small intestine. 4, 39, 41 Thus, this autoreactivity could be either induced directly by the anti-CAIX CART cells recognizing normal tissues expressing the target antigen or indirectly by antibodies or cell-mediated immunity directed to the anti-CAIX CART cells that have localized to this tissue. In contrast, mAb G36 recognizes the centrally located catalytic domain and does not recognize CAIX by immunohistochemical staining (data not shown), and therefore, it remains to be determined if similar crossreactivity and toxicity would occur in vivo with G36-CD28z CART cells. However, because of the superior effective antitumor functions of these second-generation CART cells and the fully human format of scFv, this G36-CD28z CAR may be a preferred agent for use in future clinical trials, which we propose should require a lower dose of infused CART cells and have reduced immunogenicity due to absence of HAMA and cellmediated immunity (CMI) responses to the scFv and CART cells.",

Also another potential complication is that soluble serum CAIX will cause widespread triggering of infused genetically redirected T cells which in turn might lead to massive cytokine release including IFN-\u03b3. Fortunately, several studies have documented that the soluble serum antigen did not inhibit CART cell responses as indicated by the results of cytokine release and cytotoxicity analysis. 43 In summary, we demonstrate that second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells possess superior antitumor responses as evidenced by the combined effect of stronger cytotoxic potency, increased cytokine secretion, enhanced proliferation and clonal expansion in vitro, and improved suppression of tumors in vivo with IL-2 provision. Higher response rate and low toxicity were also demonstrated in patients treated with first-generation anti-CAIX CART cells that were pretreated with chimeric CAIX Abs, a strategy that could be similarly developed here with fully human anti-CAIX mAbs. 17 In addition, as other costimulatory molecules including 4-1BB and OX40 continue to be assessed in CAR constructs in order to maximize effective activity of modified T cells 18, 19, 31, [44] [45] [46] [47] opportunities may arise to reduce the number of cells required for efficacious adoptive T-cell therapy. Importantly, the human G36-CD28z CART cells should not elicit HAMA and CMI responses during treatment cycles. We envision that these CART cells used either alone or together with other immunotherapic 48, 49 agents including those that are focused on costimulatory blockade such as CTLA4 and PD1/PDL1 axis may provide a next generation treatment for RCC.",
