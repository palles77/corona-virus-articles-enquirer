            "text": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Eriobotrya japonica, a traditional herbal medicine in China and Japan, has long been used to treat chronic bronchitis and coughs. Aim of the study: Pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs), especially ursolic acid (UA), have been found as reversibly and competitively human neutrophil elastase (HNE) inhibitors. However, the limited solubility and poor bioavailability of PTs hinder their clinical use. Crude plant extracts may have a greater activity than isolated constituents of the equivalent dosage. In this study, an Eriobotrya japonica (loquat leaves) extract (triterpenoid composition of loquat leaves, TCLL) with enriched PTs such as UA was prepared. The study aims to compare the HNE inhibitory (HNEI) effect in vitro and the therapeutic effect on acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo between TCLL and UA. Materials and methods: An HNEI activity bioassay was performed with Sivelestat sodium hydrate as a positive control. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammatory model was established to evaluate TCLL's therapeutic effect on ALI in vivo. The absorption of UA in TCLL and in UA alone was determined using a Caco-2 cell uptake model and LC-MS. Results: The IC 50 values of TCLL and UA for the HNEI effect were 3.26 \u00b1 0.56 \u03bcg/mL and 8.49 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcg/mL (P < 0.01), respectively. TCLL significantly improved the inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokine production in mice compared with the LPS group (P < 0.05). Additionally, it performed better than the UA alone group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the uptake by Caco-2 cells of UA in TCLL was higher than that in UA alone (P < 0.05). Conclusion: TCLL has a significant HNEI effect in vitro and a therapeutic effect on LPS-induced inflammation in a mouse model. Both the effects are more efficient than UA. Improved absorption of PTs in TCLL may be one explanation for these results.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome comprising acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, with a mortality rate of 40% and a cure rate of only 34% (Rubenfeld et al., 2005) . This life-threatening disease can result from severe infections, shock, trauma, or burns (Tsai et al., 2015) . Neutrophils are major inflammation mediators involved in the pathogenesis of various lung inflammatory diseases including ALI (Stevens et al., 2011) . Neutrophilic inflammation has attracted considerable attention because of the influenza caused by the influenza A H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses (Yokoyama et al., 2010) . Human neutrophil elastase (HNE) is a 30 kDa serine protease stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils. When inflammation occurs, HNE released from neutrophils and bound mainly to the neutrophil plasma membrane facilitates neutrophil migration to inflammation sites by degrading various host proteins, such as extracellular matrix proteins (Siedle et al., 2007) . Under normal physiological conditions, HNE is controlled by its endogenous inhibitors (Fitch et al., 2006; Pham, 2006; Rubin, 1996; Williams et al., 2006) . However, large amounts of oxygen radicals and proteases released by leukocytes recruited to inflammation sites can inactivate these endogenous inhibitors (Clark et al., 1981) .",

            "text": "Sivelestat sodium hydrate (ONO-5046) is the only clinically registered chemically synthesized HNE inhibitor approved for use in humans. It attenuates pulmonary disorders, improves pulmonary function, and is clinically used to treat pneumonia and ALI caused by viral infections (Yokoyama et al., 2010) . However, ONO-5046 use is limited by its poor pharmacokinetics and the potential risk of organ toxicity because it irreversibly inhibits HNE by covalently binding to Ser-195 (Huang et al., 2008; Ohbayashi, 2002; Stevens et al., 2011) . Research on synthetic HNE inhibitors has focused on nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, among which AZD9668 has superior HNE selectivity to ONO-5046, with an IC 50 value of 44 nM (Stevens et al., 2011) . Compounds of the BAY series also inhibit HNE activity, with the IC 50 value for the HNE inhibitory (HNEI) effect of BAY-678 at the picomolar level after structural modification. BAY-85-8501 was also effective in an ALI model in rodents (von Nussbaum et al., 2015) . Moreover, natural terpenoids have been reported to possess an HNEI effect Lee et al., 2015) . In another study, we found that pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs) protect against inflammation-induced lung injury by reversibly and competitively inhibiting HNE activity. Among these PTs, ursolic acid (UA) exhibited the highest inhibitory potency (IC 50 = 5.51 \u03bcM) (Feng et al., 2013) . However, its limited solubility and poor bioavailability hinder its practical use as a clinical drug (Liu, 2005) .",

Evidence exists that crude plant extracts often have greater in vitro or in vivo activity than isolated constituents of the equivalent dosage (Rasoanaivo et al., 2011) . We wanted to determine whether UA in a plant extract would have a better HNEI effect than purified UA and therefore chose Eriobotrya japonica (loquat leaves, LLs) as the objective material. In China and Japan, LLs have long been used as herbal medicine to treat chronic bronchitis and coughs (Cha et al., 2011) . Studies have indicated many health-related benefits of LLs, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Liu et al., 2016; Maher et al., 2015) . LLs are also known to be abundant in PTs, including UA . Therefore, this study elucidated the HNEI effect of the triterpenoid composition of loquat leaves (TCLL) compared with purified UA in vitro and in vivo.",

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major human transmembrane transporters (Zhou, 2008) and decreases the oral bioavailability of many drugs that are its substrates through an efflux mechanism (Eckford and Sharom, 2009 ). Some studies have reported that PTs are likely to be substrates for P-gp. When a solid dispersion of total PTs in (Cao et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2013) Fig. 2. Structure of the eight compounds in TCLL. LLs containing euscaphic acid, maslinic acid, corosolic acid, oleanolic acid, and UA was co-administered with the P-gp inhibitor verapamil in a rat model, the relative bioavailability of these PTs increased (Cai, 2013) . In this study, UA uptake in TCLL was performed by Caco-2 cells, with the results indicating that UA uptake by Caco-2 cells in TCLL was higher than that in UA alone. The results demonstrated that PTs in TCLL, which are likely to be P-gp substrates, can compete with each other in binding to P-gp, thereby increasing UA uptake in Caco-2 cells. UA is one of the major active components of LLs. Along with its HNEI and anti-inflammatory activity, UA has many other pharmacological properties (Wozniak et al., 2015) , including anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity. In this study, we demonstrated that TCLL had an enhanced HNEI effect as well as a therapeutic effect on LPS-induced inflammation. Because TCLL is simple and inexpensive to prepare, LLs extracts could replace UA in other pharmacological applications.",
