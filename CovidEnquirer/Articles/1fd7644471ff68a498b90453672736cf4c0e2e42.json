These activities span three phases in time -product conceptualization, detail design and prototyping, and product manufacturing and launch -and can be classified by job function in terms of management, sales and marketing, research and design, manufacturing, and finance and economics. The activities can also be grouped into various unit tasks, which may involve several job functions and last over more than one development phase. For example, economic analysis includes activities in both phase II and phase III, and involves manufacturing as well as finance and economics. Of particular interest are those activities, italicized in Fig. 1 , in product development that require the input of a chemical engineer. The execution of other activities within the same unit task may involve marketing and management. The key question is how to execute these unit tasks in a systematic manner to minimize the amount of time, effort and money for the development of chemical-based products. The rest of the issues in Fig. 1 such as product promotion and business management belong to other disciplines and will not be discussed in this article.",

Various issues related to product conceptualization of creams and pastes have been discussed by Wibowo and Ng (2001) . For example, the quality factors such as sensorial, rheological, mechanical, and physicochemical have been classified. These quality factors are related to the material properties such as viscosity, dielectric constant, and so on, as well as to how the constituents are assembled to form the microstructure of the product, as characterized by structural attributes such as particle or droplet size distribution, phase volume fraction, and particle shape. An understanding of the relationships between product performance, and material properties and structural attributes enables the designer to select the proper ingredients and design the manufacturing process to obtain a prod- uct with the desired performance. However, the proposed product development procedure has not been demonstrated by developing an actual product. In this study, we will expand this previous effort by collaborating with an industrial partner. This article has two objectives. First, it attempts to put the various tasks for product development in proper perspective. The ways in which market demands are identified, product performance is evaluated and product reliability is tested have not received sufficient attention in the literature. Second, it illustrates the significance of integrating experiments, modeling, and synthesis for the development of a skin-care cream product. Despite the advances in engineering sciences, experimentation is crucial for the design of chemical products particularly those with an internal microstructure.",

Subobjective D6 is further decomposed into D61-D65 and so on. This exercise is often used by a product/process development team to show all the team members the tasks that need to be performed and the time by which they should be completed. By offering a hierarchical view of the development project in its totality, every member knows what other members are doing to achieve the overall goal.

            "text": "The development of a consumer product such as a skin-care cream has been largely based on experience alone. While previous experience provides a good starting point, a substantial amount of experimental trial and error is often involved in the development of a new product. We submit that the product be synthesized by defining its constituents and microstructure, rather than simply screening different alternatives generated in a combinatorial manner. In doing so, understanding of the physical phenomena that control the product performance forms the basis for rationalizing the development process. Various models are utilized to describe the relationships among product performance, material properties, and product attributes, so as to establish a link between the targeted performance and the required technical specifications of the product. Experiments are used to support the modeling effort, as complete scientific elucidation of the underlying physical phenomena behind the technology of many chemical products is still a long way off (Wintermantel, 1999) . Thus, this integrative approach does not eliminate the need for previous experiences. Rather, it helps to organize them in a systematic way so that they can be better utilized in the development of a new product. Fig. 3 shows a generic Workflow Diagram for product development which underscores the importance of iterations. It shows three iteration loops. The inner loop illustrates how the ingredients and processing conditions are modified to yield the desired product performance. This is achieved by using a combination of experiments, modeling and synthesis. The outer loop shows that the product quality factors are redefined after evaluation of a product prototype by a test panel. Sometimes, test marketing is carried out after small-scale manufacturing. The outermost loop (dotted line) represents the situation where market needs are re-examined after market testing.",

It is comprised of a variety of antioxidants, such as glutathione (GSH) and \u2423tocopherol (\u2423-TOC), that protect skin against damaging effects from reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is now well established that solar UV radiation can stimulate ROS production in skin cells and skin tissue (Hanson, Gratton, & Barden, 2006; Heck, Vetrano, Mariano, & Laskin, 2003) , causing a dramatic decrease in such antioxidants due to the oxidative injury by these UV-induced free radicals. Also, ROS stimulate the synthesis of collagen-degrading enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases. Loss of collagen, one of the primary structural components of dermis responsible for conferring strength and support to human skin, will lead to the appearance of wrinkles (Craven et al., 1997) . Given the causal role of ROS in skin aging and in the development of skin cancer (Baumann, 2007) , in addition to blocking the UV light, the supplementation of sunscreen with antioxidants represents a rational approach to ameliorating the solar UV-induced skin damage (Farris, 2005; Thiele, Hsieh, & Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2005; Weber et al., 1997) . This was achieved by developing a skin-care cream with two new ingredients, zinc oxide nanoparticles and an herbal extract. Zinc oxide is well accepted as a physical UV absorbent and has been widely used in sun-screening products. In this investigation, an antioxidant derived from Fructus Schisandrae (FS) was used due to its proven antioxidant function (Ko & Mak, 2004) . In addition, moisturizing function is also required.",

However, sunscreen cream is perceived to be thick and greasy.

Furthermore, the use of appropriate emulsifiers with proper concentrations is critical to the stability of the product. The presence of zinc oxide particles in the formula can lead to whitening effect on the skin due to the reflection of visible light. This problem can be avoided by using zinc oxide nanoparticles.",

Since market survey indicated that customers favor natural ingredients, sunflower oil (Sigma) and sweet almond oil (Sigma-Aldrich) were selected for this product. A silicon oil, dimethicone, was chosen due to its non-sticky, highly spreadable, and water repellent properties. Taking into account the oil contents in the zinc oxide suspension mixture, 1% sunflower oil, 1% almond oil and 2% silicon oil were used in the base case formula. The concentration of cetyl alcohol, a co-emulsifier, was kept at 1%. Note that a cream containing more than 2% cetyl alcohol might result in soaping effect. In addition, 0.2% of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate copolymer was used as a film former to promote the formation of a uniform sunscreen film on the skin upon applying the product in prototype 1. Carbomers (Carbopol \u00ae 940, 941, Lubrizol) and xanthan gum (Sigma-Aldrich) were selected as thickeners, again on the basis of common usage. Glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich) and propylene glycol (Acros) were chosen as humectants. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate (Invitrogen) and a mixture of diazolidinyl urea and iodopropynyl butylcarbamate (Liquid Germall \u00ae Plus) were used as the stabilizer and preservatives, respectively. Their compositions were selected based on the suggested concentrations in Table 4 . Fragrance was not considered in this formula. The next step was to determine the usage of emulsifiers. In theory, emulsifiers should be selected based on the required hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value, which can be calculated based on the overall HLB value of the oil mixture,",

Alternatively, the HLB values of different emulsifiers could be calculated based on their particular functional groups (Vaughan & Rice, 1990) . However, the HLB system does not provide a definite answer to the selection problem, as other properties such as the compatibility of ingredients, the viscosity of the continuous phase and size of the emulsion droplets could affect the rate of creaming or phase splitting (Lissant, 1974) , which dictates the stability of the emulsion system. Therefore, experienced formulators normally select an appropriate mixture of emulsifiers according to the types of emollients used. Experimentally, the required HLB value can be determined by mixing a pair of emulsifiers with high and low HLB values with the desired sample and see which HLB value yields a stable emulsion (Courtney, 1997; Uniqema Ltd., 2005) .",

A procedure and heuristics for generating the process alternatives for making creams and pastes were discussed by Wibowo and Ng (2001) . Process alternatives for generating the desired microstructure should be identified. This will help provide an estimate of the product cost, and thus the selling price. Often, this is decided by a balance between an acceptable return on investment and the selling price of the products on the market. For a given production rate, material and energy balance analyses are performed to determine raw material consumption, waste generation, utility consumption, and the required processing time. The cost of raw materials, especially the active ingredients, often represents a major portion of the product cost. In addition to transportation costs, import and export taxes and advertizing costs must be considered as they often substantially affect the overall economics. Often, a trade-off exists between raw material cost and production cost, as lower purity raw materials may require expensive pre-treatment before it can be incorporated into the product. Some impurities are totally unacceptable. For example, the presence of heavy metals in a skin-care product, even at a very minute concentration, can lead to a disastrous product recall. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the raw material source. Availability and consistency of the supply of the raw materials, especially the natural herbs, should also be considered at this stage.",

Keep the stirring speed of mixer or high-shear homogenizer below 10,000 rpm to avoid breaking down the carbon chains of the thickener by the strong mechanical energy. If phase inversion method is used, vigorous stirring is not necessary. In industrial practice, the homogenizer should be equipped with vacuum line to remove bubble during agitation. In bench scale experiment, bubbles could be removed in vacuum oven or sonication bath. product viscosity can be increased by using a higher concentration of thickener, while a smoother feel on the skin may be achieved by adjusting the oil to water phase ratio, using a different emollient, and so on. The modified recipe is then used for making the next prototype.",

The oil phase contained all the oil-soluble ingredients, the aqueous phase consisted of the water-soluble ingredients and the third Phase split after stability test If oil phase splits out, reduce the HLB value of emulsifiers If aqueous phase splits out, increase the HLB value of emulsifiers When solids suspension is involved in the formula, consider using polymeric emulsifiers group was the preservatives. The mixing procedure was developed based on the heuristics in Table 6 . The aqueous phase was prepared first by dispersing the thickener, Carbopol \u00ae 940, in 80 g of water under mild heating and a stirring speed of 800 rpm using a magnetic stir plate. Most of the remaining components in the aqueous phase were mixed in a separate beaker and heated to 70 \u2022 C. These two solutions were combined at 70 \u2022 C after the thickener was completely dissolved. Triethanolamine, the pH modifier, was added last; the solution was thickened and the pH value reached 5-6. The oil phase was prepared by mixing cetyl alcohol, dimethicone, sunflower seed oil, and sweet almond oil under gentle heating. Zinc oxide suspension, Fructus Schisandrae extract, stearth-2 and oleth-20 were then added to the mixture sequentially. After raising the temperature of the oil phase to 70 \u2022 C, the oil phase was added to the aqueous phase slowly at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The mixture emulsified immediately and was left for natural cooling. The droplet size of the mixture was further reduced with the use of a hand-held mixer (Kenwood) for 3-5 min and then returned to moderate mixing, as excessive mixing might induce bubbles or weaken the thickeners. When the temperature of the emulsion reached 45 \u2022 C, the preservative phase was added with general mixing. The cream was then immersed in a sonication bath for 5 min to remove any trapped bubbles and was then allowed to cool to room temperature. According to the vendor of zinc oxide, the pH should not be kept below 7.5. Since the pH value for cosmetic products is usually limited to 5.5-8.0, we decided to maintain the pH value of this skin-care product close to 7.5 with the pH modifier.",

It is hierarchical in the sense that decision-making progresses from objective to subobjective with increasing levels of details, while keeping in mind the overall product development project. The objective-time chart (Fig. 2) reflects this hierarchical thinking, which is in a way a simple extension of the hierarchical process design method proposed by Douglas (1988) . Also well-recognized is the multiscale nature of product development in that the time and length scales of the relevant physicochemical phenomena, production activities, and logistics and transportation beyond the manufacturing plant differ by orders of magnitude (Charpentier, 2007; Grossmann & Westerberg, 2000; Lerou & Ng, 1996) . Product development inevitably involves professionals in sales and marketing, law, project management, advertising, and financial analysis. This multidisciplinary nature is captured in Fig. 1 where the activities in product development are classified by phase and by job function, and several unit tasks are identified. In fact, on the technical side, there are also chemicalbased products in science and engineering areas such as medicine, healthcare, foods, electronics and information technology that are not the primary domain of a typical chemical engineer. The need for iterations in product development is represented by the workflow diagram (Fig. 3) . A product that warrants the significant investment associated with product launch demands detailed consideration from all angles.",

This skin-care cream case study provides a concrete example to illustrate the multitude of issues. On product conceptualization, chemical engineers have to actively collaborate with other professionals on business decision-making. While science and engineering can address how-to-make by selecting suitable materials and processing techniques, what-to-make inevitably involves marketing, IP position, and a host of environmental and safety issues. On research and development, the use of experiments, modeling and synthesis in an iterative manner is the key for prototyping.",

However, the heuristics, experiments and models are expected to be product class-specific. It is unlikely that the development team can come up with the best execution plan for a new product if the team does not have previous experience in working with the relevant line of products. In fact, the final objective-time chart (Fig. 4 ) and the RAT 2 IO module for the overall skin-care cream development project (Table 1) , and the workflow diagram for iterations in prototype fabrication (Fig. 8 ) and the corresponding RAT 2 IO module (Table 9 ) actually took shape towards the end of this study. Nonetheless, these can certainly be used to expedite the development of similar products in the future. The importance of performance tests in product development was demonstrated. A bioassay, which involved live skin preparation, was essential for assessing the antioxidant activity of the cream formulation. Along with measurements for the sun-screening and moisturizing functions, they serve as measures for optimizing the formulation of sunscreen cream.",

An obvious question would be, what are the market segments that chemical engineering as a profession would like to engage in? A similar question was posed by the processing community in China (Ng, Li, & Kwauk, 2005) . In addition, in each market segment, what are the tasks that a chemical engineer would like to and can perform? These questions have ramifications in what we consider to be a typical chemical engineering curriculum. The possible inclusion of business subjects in a chemical engineering education has been discussed by Landau (1997) , Ng (2002) , Ng and Wibowo (2003) and Wei (2008) . The concept of unit operations has served process design well by providing the building blocks for process flowsheeting. Now, can the concept of unit tasks with their associated RAT 2 IO modules, properly defined, categorized and enriched with the necessary technical as well as non-technical details, serve as the building blocks for product development? Efforts to address some of these issues are underway.",
