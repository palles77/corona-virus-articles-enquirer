Immunopathol., Natural killer (NK) cell activity in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of newborn piglets, normally negligible, was stimulated by in vitro treatment with porcine type I interferon (IFN), and the NK activity of PBL from weaned piglets was augmented by the same treatment. Binding of the PBL to the PK-15 targets used in the single cell cytotoxicity assay for NK activity was not affected by age or by IFN treatment. When newborn piglets were treated with a single intravenous dose at 2 days of age of 0.5 mg/kg of polyinosinic : polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carlJoxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC), a synthetic IFN inducer, their IFN levels peaked at 6 h post-induction, and NK activity in their PBL peaked at 24 h post-induction at the level normally found in weaned piglets. The NK activity then declined until 7 days post-induction, when it increased again in a similar manner to that in untreated control piglets. Target-binding of the PBL was not affected by poly ICLC treatment of the piglets. Newborn piglets treated with poly ICLC and subsequently exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed a delay in onset of clinical signs of TGE compared with untreated control piglets. It was concluded that NK cells in newborn piglets can be activated by treatment of the piglets with poly ICLC, and that the presence of active NK cells is associated with some increase in resistance to challenge with TGE virus.",

The resulting complex (poly ICLC ) was stored at 4 \u00b0 C. Piglets were inoculated intravenously with poly ICLC at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg of poly IC within 2 days of birth. Four litters of crossbred Yorkshire piglets were used, from a specific pathogen-free herd which lacked virus neutralizing antibodies to TGE virus. The sows farrowed in isolation, and suckled their piglets for the duration of each experiment. Three litters were used to determine the effect of poly ICLC treatment on NK activity. Approximately half the piglets in each litter were randomly selected for treatment, with the remainder as untreated controls. The fourth litter was used to determine the effect of poly ICLC treatment on the response to challenge with TGE virus, as described below.",

All the treated piglets had IFN titres, which ranged from 80 to 640 units/0.4 ml (mean 246 units/0.4 ml). IFN was not detected in any of the control piglets. Three poly ICLC-treated and three untreated control piglets were tested for IFN and NK activity at each of the times shown in Fig. 1 , except at 12 and 16 days of age when single treated and control animals were tested. The mean titres of IFN at 12 h and 24 h after treatment were 160 units/0.4 ml and 53 units/0.4 ml, respectively. No IFN was found in the other sera tested except at low titres (10-20 units/0.4 ml) in control piglets at 10 and 14 days of age. NK activity ( Fig. 1 ) was demonstrated in the PBL of the treated piglets 12 h post-induction, and peaked at 1 day post-induction. The level of NK activity in the treated piglets then declined until 7 days post-induction to a level similar to that found in the untreated controls at 9 days of age. NK activity was significantly (P< 0.05) higher in the treated piglets than in the untreated controls from 12 h to 5 days post-induction. days of age ) to the end of the experiment, NK activity in the treated and control piglets increased at a similar rate, and at 16 days of age the levels of NK activity were similar to those described above for weaned piglets. Conjugate formation remained at a similar level to that found above in neonatal piglets throughout the experiment, and there were no significant differences in conjugate formation between the treated and control piglets.",

The poly ICLC-treated piglets lost weight during the 6-h period following treatment, when they were dull and listless, and did not feed, but they had recovered by 8 h post-induction, and gained weight during the following 24 h. Diarrhoea began in all the untreated control piglets on day 3, within 24 h of contact exposure to the two piglets which were dosed orally with TGE virus. During this day the untreated piglets showed considerable weight loss (Fig. 2 ) and all of them had rather watery diarrhoea. At this time the treated piglets remained clinically normal and continued to gain weight. Signs of TGE were not detected in any of the treated piglets until 18 h later, on day 4, when they all showed watery diarrhoea and a dramatic loss in body weight (Fig. 2) . For the remainder of the experiment the treated and control piglets were clinically similar. All had persistent, watery diarrhoea, and they failed to gain weight. One treated piglet died on day 10, when the remaining piglets were killed. At post-mortem examination the carcasses of the control and treated piglets were indistinguishable. All showed dehydration and cachexia, with fluid contents throughout the intestinal tract. DISCUSSION The in vitro activation of PBL from newborn piglets by incubation with serum from piglets treated 6 h previously with poly ICLC was probably due to the presence of IFN in the serum. Any residual poly ICLC in the serum would be well below the concentration found by Chung et al. (1982) to be required for direct activation of the PBL by poly IC. This finding extended the earlier observation of neonatal NK activation by the treatment of PBL with IFN prepared by cocultivation of PBL with TGE virus-infected cells (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1986) . The demonstration of in vitro neonatal porcine NK cell activation was also in agreement with the activation of PBL from newborn piglets with human IFN by Charley et al. (1985) , although it contrasted with the failure of Kim and Chung (1985) to reconstitute NK activity in neonatal porcine PBL with human IFN. The augmentation by IFN of the NK activity of PBL from weaned piglets which we observed was in agreement with the reported in vitro augmentation of NK activity in PBL from adult pigs by treatment with porcine IFN (Chung et al., 1982; Charley et al., 1983) , and with previous studies in this laboratory (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1986) .",

Poly ICLC treatment caused rapid activation of NK cells in vivo, but had no effect on conjugate formation by the PBL. By 24 h after inoculation with poly ICLC the level of NK activity in the PBL of the treated piglets was as high as that found in normal weaned piglets, but the activity subsequently declined. It was particularly noteworthy that the rise in serum IFN was immediately followed by NK cell activation, and that the decline of NK activity was preceded by falling IFN titres. This relationship is consistent with the hypothesis that the IFN induced by the poly ICLC treatment resulted in transient activation of the NK cells. The kinetics of NK activation were similar to those described in mice treated with poly IC in an early paper on this topic (Djeu et al., 1979) . At 9 days of age the treated piglets showed evidence of natural activation of their NK cells, similar to that observed in the untreated controls, indicating tht they were not refractory to subsequent activation.",

In contrast, it has been found in humans that the target-binding of neonatal PBL is lower than that of adult PBL (Baley and Schacter, 1985; Nair et al., 1985) , but as in our studies, the target-binding capacity of human NK cells was not increased by IFN treatment ( Silva et al., 1980; Marumo et al., 1984) .",

It is noteworthy that in an earlier study ( Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984b) , in which NK activity was established in newborn piglets by the adoptive transfer of adult porcine PBL, there was also an increase in incubation period when the piglets were challenged with TGE virus.
