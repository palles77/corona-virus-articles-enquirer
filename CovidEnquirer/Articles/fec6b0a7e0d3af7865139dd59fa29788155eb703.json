            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) is a coronavirus that instigated regional epidemics in Canada and several Asian countries in 2003. The newly identified SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can be transmitted among humans and cause severe or even fatal illnesses. As preventive vaccine development takes years to complete and adverse reactions have been reported to some veterinary coronaviral vaccines, anti-viral compounds must be relentlessly pursued. In this study, we analyzed the effect of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) on SARS-CoV replication in cell culture, and found that ATA could drastically inhibit SARS-CoV replication, with viral production being 1000-fold less than that in the untreated control. Importantly, when compared with IFNs a and b, viral production was inhibited by more than 1000-fold as compared with the untreated control. In addition, when compared with IFNs a and b, ATA was approximately 10 times more potent than IFN a and 100 times more than interferon b at their highest concentrations reported in the literature previously. Our data indicated that ATA should be considered as a candidate anti-SARS compound for future clinical evaluation.",

The virus has a high tendency to spread among humans, and the mortality can be as high as 10-15% [1, 2] . The complete understanding of pathogenesis of SARS remains tentative, a recent histological study using SARS-CoV-infected patient lung samples found that diffuse alveolar damage may play important roles in the progression of the disease [3] . Even though there was a significant morbidity drop this year, the likelihood of evolution of SARS-CoV in human and animals may result in a re-emergence of the deadly virus.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with singlestranded positive-sense RNA genomes approximately 30 kb [4] . Most viruses in coronavirus family cause diseases in animal, while a few of them; such as HCoV-229E, HCoV OC43, HCoV-NL-63, and SARS-CoV are human pathogens [5] [6] [7] . Among all human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is the only one that causes severe clinical consequences. Sequence comparisons of SARS-CoV genome sequences from different patient isolates revealed high homology; yet, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses is significant. There are about 15 predicted open reading frames, among them six can be linked to other known coronavirus genes. These genes are 1a-1b, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), which was found to be in a multimeric form and involved in host cell signal transduction regulations [8, 9] . The rest of ORFs may encode genes with unknown functions [1] . Antiviral development for SARS-CoV has been vigorously pursued after the identification of the virus with mixed successes and challenges. Tan et al. screened anti-SARS-CoV 19 clinically approved compounds, including nucleoside analogs, interferons, protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. IFNs b-1b, a-n1, a-n3, and ribavarin showed anti-viral activities at high concentrations. However, significant cytotoxic effects or lack of efficacy was also observed [10] . For instance, in two other independent assays, ribavarin was shown to have little effect against SARS-CoV replication, [11, 12] . IFNs a, b-1b, a-n1, and a-n3 have also been tested for their anti-SARS-CoV activities [10, 12] , however, the moderate inhibition effect of SARS-CoV replication by interferons could only be observed at very high concentrations [10, 12] . As for new drug development, glycyrrhizin was reported to possess anti-SARS-CoV activity at high concentrations [12] . Clearly, continuing search for potent anti-SARS-CoV compounds is absolutely necessary.",

This unique feature implicates that the transcription of coronavirus RNA is very important for the virus replication. Aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) has been shown to inhibit the RNA transcription of vesicular stomatitis virus [13] . It has also been shown that ATA could interact with ribosomal proteins in vitro and inhibit the protein synthesis [14, 15] . In this study, we studied the antiviral effects of ATA against SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells and found that ATA drastically inhibited the virus replication by as much as 1000-fold compared to the untreated controls, while little toxicity has been observed to be associated with ATA treatment. Antiviral selectivity of ATA was demonstrated by its failure to inhibit adenovirus replication. Importantly, we found that ATA is a much potent anti-SARS-CoV compound than IFNs a and b.",

However, the mechanism involved in its ability of inhibiting virus replication in those studies remains largely unknown, as is also the case in our current studies on SARS-CoV. The potency of ATA against SARS-CoV replication is also higher than that of the reported chemicals such as glycyrrhizin and recently reported nelfinavir [12, 20] ; both drug candidates were reported to have two logs or less inhibition effect on SARS-CoV replication, while ATA showed more than three logs of inhibition effect. The biological activities of ATA have been demonstrated to be quite complicated, including inhibition of protein synthesis, prevention of the attachment of mRNA to ribosomes in cell-free systems, and suppression of enzymes involved in polynucleotide metabolism [21] . How ATA exerts its anti-SARS-CoV activities will require vigorous characterization. Our preliminary result indicated that ATA could inhibit SARS-CoV RNA synthesis (data not shown). Vaccine development could take years to complete and serious adverse reactions have been reported in other coronavirus vaccine studies, i.e., exacerbation of disease in animals received vaccines prior to infection [22] . Certain precautions have been proposed for the development of SARS-CoV vaccines due to potential detrimental effects [23] , therefore the search for anti-SARS-CoV drugs must be pursued. Here, we report for the first time that ATA is a potent anti-SARS compound with low toxicity in tissue culture, suggesting that it could have therapeutic value for SARS in patients. Vero cells were seeded in a 96-well plate. Dilutions of ATA, interferons a and b were added. After 24 h. Fifty microliters of reaction solution from XTT kit was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. Activities of cell proliferations were reflected by readings of spectrophotometry. The concentrations of each reagent that inhibits 50% cell proliferation activities (CC 50 ) were used to compare with the concentration that inhibit 50% of SARS-CoV replication (EC 50 ), and designated as the selection index (SI). Fig. 3 . Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV and treated with serially diluted concentrations of aurintricarboxylic acid. HEK293 cells were transfected with adenovirus X construct expressing EGFP. After 24 h, cells were harvested and subjected to 4-12% SDS-PAGE; protein samples were subsequently transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV spike protein (for Vero cell extracts), mouse monoclonal antibody against EGFP (for HEK293 cell extracts), and anti-a-actinin antibodies.
