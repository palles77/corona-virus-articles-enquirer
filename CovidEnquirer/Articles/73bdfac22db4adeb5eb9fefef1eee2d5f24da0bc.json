As a revision of the classical relative entropy (RE), our metric (1) works equivalently with RE in the case of small k, (2) avoids the degeneracy when some word types are absent in one sequence but not in the other. Experiments on 25 viruses including SARS-CoVs show that our method and RE give exactly the same phylogenetic tree when word length k 6 3. When k > 3, our method still works and gets convergent phylogenetic topology but the RE gives degenerate results.",

Early approaches to deal with it were mainly based on the alignment of a gene or protein sequence. But on one hand, ''different genes may tell different stories\"-unequal mutational rates of different genes or different pieces of genes and lateral gene transfer are widely detected, so a single gene or protein sequence usually does not have enough information to determine its phylogenetic position. On the other hand, traditional alignment methods are computationally intensive and meaningless to whole genome comparison because each genome has its own genes and gene order. In a word, there is an urgent need to develop new phylogenetic methods utilizing the ever-increasing genome data.",

Among the earliest attempts is the gene content method [1, 2] , which utilizes the ratio between the number of genes two species share and the total number of genes. This method is very simple and can be applied to long genomes. But it fails when species are closely related to each other, e.g., mt genome sequences of some placental mammals used by Cao et al. [3] . Because these genomes share exactly the same genes and gene order. Similar work along this line is the gene order method [4] , which also fails in the above case. Besides, some methods based on graphical representations of DNA sequences are outlined [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , which usually translate a DNA sequence to a set of plots in 2D/3D space, and use some graphical invariants to characterize this sequence. These methods provide a simple way of viewing, sorting and comparing various gene structures.",

Observing that relative abundances of all dinucleotide are remarkably constant across the genome, Karlin et al. [11] [12] [13] proposed the genome signature to characterize this genome. The genome signature consists of the array of dinucleotide relative abundances q xy \u00bc f xy =f x f y extended over all dinucleotides, where f x is the frequency of nucleotide x and f xy is the frequency of dinucleotide xy. Alternatively, relative abundance of tri-, tetra-or even k-nucleotides can also be calculated.

Since the frequency of a k-nucleotide measures the probability of its occurrence in the given sequence, it is intuitive to use the relative entropy between two frequency vectors as a measure of distance. Let p i A and p i B be the observed frequencies of the i-th knucleotide in sequences A and B, respectively. The relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler distance) [19] is defined as The relative entropy is the inefficiency of assuming that the distribution is p B when the true distribution is p A . It does not satisfy the symmetry condition and the triangle inequality, so it is not strictly a distance measure. The relative entropy, however, satisfies many important and useful mathematical properties. For example, it is a convex function of p i A , always nonnegative, and vanishes if and only if p i A \u00bc p i B for all possible i. Apparently, vector representations of biological sequences will lose some information in the case of small k, e.g., only nucleotide composition is known when k \u00bc 1. More information (especially the sequence-order information) will be captured if we consider higher-order words. But unfortunately, as the word order increases, some word types in one sequence may be absent in the other sequence. This leads to the degenerate result when Formula (1) is used. Meanwhile, it is widely detected that some ''word spaces\" are not saturated for an individual genome, especially for protein sequences. A research of the 101,602 protein sequences in SWISS-PROT database Rel. 40 (2000) showed that all these proteins have taken only less than 26% of the 6-aminoacids strings. In particular, EcoliK has taken less than 2% and Mycge less than 0.3% of the 6-aminoacids strings [20] .",

However, this is still a controversial topic-alignment-based methods showed that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any previously isolated groups and form a new group [24, 25] ; maximum likelihood tree built from a fragment of the spike protein preferred SARS-CoVs clustering with group II coronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus and rat coronavirus) [26] ; while an information-based method, which makes use of the whole genome sequences, indicated that SARS-CoVs are close to the group I coronaviruses rather than form a new group [27] .",

This tree is mainly identical to our tree, i.e., torovirus stays outside of all coronaviruses, and SARS-CoVs are closer to the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). But an obvious default in this tree is that it fails to cluster the three group I coronaviruses: HCoV-229E, PEDV and TGEV. Fig. 4 lists the phylogenetic tree constructed by d COS . This topology supports SARS-CoVs and group II as a closer pair, which is in accordance with the result of Li\u00f2 and Goldman using a fragment of the spike protein [26] . However, this tree also fails to cluster the group I coronaviruses. In Fig. 5 , we list the tree built by linear correlation coefficient between pairwise frequency vectors. This tree perfectly clusters species within each typical group, and supports the outgroup status of SARS-CoVs relative to other coronaviruses. But it fails to identify the outgroup status of torovirus relative to coronaviruses.",

It has relatively low computational complexity, and does not suffer from genetic rearrangements and transposon activity, which serve as common ways of genome evolution. In most cases, biological sequences are represented as occurrence or composition vectors in a high dimensional Euclidean space, and phylogenetic results are high reliable on the quality of this vector representation. In order to capture more sequence information and obtain a better vector representation, the suitable word length is of critical importance. According to the information theory, this length reflects the balance between noise and information-some information may be lost if one uses overshort words, while noise will dominate when long words are considered. Moreover, suitable length of word is often species-specific. In a word, a well-defined distance measure which can be applied to any word length is of great importance.",

However, as word order increases, this approach will get degenerate results due to the absent of some word types. In the present paper, we propose three revisions of the classical relative entropy (RE). These modifications perform equally with RE in phylogenetic inferences in the case of short words. But when long words are considered, our method still works and gets convergent phylogenetic topologies (in such case, RE gets degenerate results as some word types are absent). Through constructing phylogenetic trees using WSE and some classical distance measures, we find that, as far as the set of 25 virus sequences is concerned, our distances are not inferior to those classical methods. According to our tree, all SARS-CoVs form a group, which is more related to the group I coronavirus: TGEV. This result is mainly in accordance with the phylogeny given by Yang et al. [27] , and is also supported by the experimental evidence, which showed that group I coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) specific antibodies are able to recog- nize antigens in SARS-CoV infected cultured cells [37] . We hope our modification can be served as an alternative approach to avoid the degeneracy, and has potential to study information expressed by different orders of words (when RE-based approaches are used). However, as sequences in our data set have no significant difference in length, our three weight methods give nearly the same phylogeny. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the accuracy in estimation of probability in multinomial distribution is proportional to sqrt(length). So when using relatively larger data sets, especially in the case that sequences have significant differences in length, we prefer the revision D 3 giving relatively competitive phylogenetic results.",

Experimentally, we will ''generate\" phylogenetic trees under different evolutionary models, and reconstruct the phylogenetic topologies from their corresponding external nodes (OTU) using our distances and RE. Then performance of different WSE can be evaluated by checking the consistency of these phylogenetic topologies. Theoretically, we hypothesize that order relations between pairwise sequence distances calculated by RE and WSE are in accordance, i.e., WSE\u00f0A; B\u00de <WSE\u00f0C; D\u00de if and only if RE\u00f0A; B\u00de < RE\u00f0C; D\u00de, for any sequences A, B, C and D (proof will be presented in our future paper). This phenomenon, on one hand, can partially explain the equivalence of WSE and RE in phylogenetic inferences in the case of short words, and on the other hand, can help to analyze the performances of different weight methods.",
