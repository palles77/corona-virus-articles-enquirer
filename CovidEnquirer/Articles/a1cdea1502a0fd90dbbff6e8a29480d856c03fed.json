These observations suggest that the cause of diarrhea is complex rather than associated with a single pathogen. Diagnosis of enteric disease also is likely affected by the complexity of the microbiota (ie, the rich and diverse polymicrobial community present in the gut).",

            "text": "The gastrointestinal microbiota plays an important role in maintaining host health by providing vitamins and energy, 3 by facilitating development of gut tissue and the immune system, 4 by modulating inflammatory responses at local and distal organs, 5 and by competing with pathogens for nutrients and attachment sites on the gut epithelial surface. 6 Although traditional focus on calf diarrhea has been on individual pathogens, it has become increasingly clear in other species that microbial populations play a key role in health and disease. Disruption of this ecosystem, otherwise known as \"dysbiosis,\" can trigger gastrointestinal disorders. 7 To date, the molecular basis of dysbiosis and the key bacterial groups involved remain poorly defined. It is clear however that if the gut microbiota is disrupted (eg, antibiotic treatment, gut inflammation) the risk of disease can increase substantially [8] [9] [10] and re-establishment of the normal microbiota can result in recovery from disease. 11 Despite current attention and research on the gut microbiota, few population-based studies have been conducted in cattle to better understand how the microbiota and its functional potential are impacted during neonatal diarrhea. Calf diarrhea may be associated with altered microbial diversity and decreased abundance of butyrate-producing microorganisms during the first weeks of life. 12 The gastrointestinal microbiota is a major contributor to the physiological, nutritional, and immunological functions of the gut. Therefore, the structure and functional roles of the microbiota in diarrheic calves should be examined in more detail. The objectives of our study were to profile the fecal microbiota and predict the functional potential of microbial communities in healthy calves and calves with diarrhea from 2 large dairy farms with dissimilar management practices.",

[31] [32] [33] We identified significant differences in the fecal microbiota and its predicted functional metabolic pathways in healthy and diarrheic calves from 2 large dairy farms with different management practices. The analyses evaluating the similarity of community membership and structure of the fecal microbiota showed that calves from the same farm shared similar microbial communities regardless of the health status when compared to healthy and diarrheic calves from a different farm.

            "text": "The development of intestinal microbiota in neonatal calves is a dynamic and complex process influenced by external and internal factors that affect intestinal microbial succession. 30 External factors include microbial load in the environment, delivery mode, 34 type of colostrum, 35 type of feeding (raw milk versus pasteurized milk versus milk replacer), 29 housing, 36 and administration of probiotics, prebiotics, or antibiotics. [37] [38] [39] Individual factors that can influence gut microbiota include nutritional state, functional immaturity of the immune system, intestinal pH, peristalsis, bile acids, bacterial mucosal receptors, and microbial interactions. 40 Therefore, management factors are a likely explanation for the interfarm differences that were noted, but further study of factors that influence both the individual calf and farm-level microbiota is needed. In humans and most other studied species, a small number of phyla tend to account for the majority of the intestinal microbiota. Firmicutes tends to be the dominant phylum in most animal species, 12, 15, 41, 42 as was the case here. The predominance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria noted in these calves is also consistent with previous studies in infants, 41 foals, 42 piglets, 15 and calves. 12, 35 The predominance of Actinobacteria is presumably a reflection of the early colonization of the gut in neonates. Bovine milk contains complex nondigestible oligosaccharides 43 that promote proliferation of specific gut microbes, especially Bifidobacterium spp. from the Actinobacteria phyla. 44 Although it is difficult to define normal calf microbiota, general trends can be inferred from previous studies. From a phylum-level perspective, the fecal microbiota of healthy Holstein calves during the neonatal period was dominated by Firmicutes, with a relative abundance ranging from 64 to 82%, followed by Bacteroidetes (8-24%), Proteobacteria (4-10%), Fusobacteria (1-6%), and Actinobacteria (1-2%). 12 At the genus level, several studies identified higher abundance of Bacteroides and Clostridium spp. in the feces of healthy calves. [27] [28] [29] In addition, in pre-weaned Holstein calves relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a microorganism that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, was higher during the first weeks of life and this high abundance was associated with decreased incidence of diarrhea. 12 Our results differed with the aforementioned studies in several aspects. The phylum Bacteroidetes accounted for <1% of the total sequences identified in healthy and diarrheic calves, something that could be accounted for, at least in part, by methodology, because it is well established that differences in Bacteroidetes abundance can be found with Illumina vs 454 sequencing likely due to the choice of different primers (V4-V5 vs V4, respectively). 45 Proteobacteria, especially members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, were enriched in feces of healthy calves from F2, and in feces of diarrheic calves from both F1 and F2. The increase in diarrheic calves is not surprising as this phylum often is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, 46 but the difference between farms was interesting. A recent study of nursing calves from 5 beef farms identified some farms with high relative abundances of Proteobacteria, 47 suggesting that higher Proteobacteria levels could be a farm-associated effect, perhaps from management practices. This could be of concern because recent studies have identified a mechanistic interrelation among Proteobacteria, the gut immune response, and inflammation. 48, 49 Dysregulated innate immune responses can elicit the bloom of Proteobacteria that promotes gut inflammation and facilitate inflammation or invasion by pathogens. 50, 51 Additionally, the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. was lower in healthy calves, a somewhat surprising result because F. prausnitzii has been associated with anti-inflammatory properties by stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, decreasing the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and by the production of butyrate. 52, 53 Contradictory results regarding the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium spp in feces of preweaned calves from different farms also have been reported in dairy 12, 27 and beef calves. 47 The reasons accounting for these differences are unclear, but differences in methodologies among studies as well as a farm-associated effects (management practices) could explain the differences in gut microbiota.",

This approach infers the functional capacity of the microbiota by prediction of functional genes that typically are associated with different taxa. Although the biological relevance of this approach is still unclear, LEfSe analysis identified several functional gene categories that were enriched in healthy and diarrheic calves. Diarrheic calves had decreased abundances of genes responsible for metabolism of various vitamins (eg, folate, panthotenate), amino acids (eg, valine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, serine, threonine) and carbohydrate metabolism. This imbalance might indicate that free vitamin and nutrient availability is altered in diarrheic calves. Alterations in amino acid metabolism have been observed in dogs with chronic diarrhea caused by idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, 53 in cats with acute diarrhea, 54 and in humans with gut inflammation, 67 suggesting that amino acid dysmetabolism may be an important feature of dysbiosis-associated diseases. Increased relative abundances of genes associated with porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism also were present in diarrheic calves. Porphyrins are tetrapyrroles that bind covalently to a metal (iron, to form cytochromes, peroxidase, catalase, myoglobin, and hemoglobin; copper or nickel, to form molecules for electron transport in methanogenic bacteria). 68 In nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals, insects, fungi, and protozoa, as well as in the a-Proteobacteria group of bacteria, the committed step for porphyrin biosynthesis is the formation of d-aminolevulinic acid by the reaction of the amino acid glycine with succinyl CoA from the citric acid cycle. 68 Metabolites such as daminolevulinic acid potentially could be used as a marker of increased abundance of Proteobacteria and therefore dysbiosis. However, PICRUSt is only a predictor of metagenomic function, and metabolomic approaches are preferred to identify factual changes in metabolic function of microbiota of diarrheic calves and identify markers of unstable gut microbiota.",
