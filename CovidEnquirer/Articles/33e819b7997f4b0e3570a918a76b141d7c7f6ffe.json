            "text": "According to the World Health Organization, a total of 8477 people world wide were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the February to July 2003. Of these, 813 died. During Seizure (2005) Background: During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, many patients avoided hospital visit because of fear of infection. Antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal is a risk factor for seizure recurrence. Therefore, seizure control during the SARS outbreak is a good model for examining the impact of drug withdrawal in seizure control. Methods: All seizures experienced by each patient before, during, and after the SARS outbreak periods were registered in each patient's seizure diary. The patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of drug withdrawal as well as seizure attack. In each group, seizures occurring during three different periods were compared. Risk factors for seizure recurrence were also examined. Results: Of 227 cases, 49 stopped taking medication during the outbreak. Among them, 28 suffered seizure attacks during AED withdrawal. Four cases developed cluster attacks and two cases had status epilepticus after AED withdrawal. AED withdrawal produced a significant increase in seizure frequency. The major risk factors for withdrawal seizures were symptomatic etiologies, polytherapy and nonseizure free before AED withdrawal. Conclusions: The SARS outbreak adversely affected seizure control because of AED withdrawal. Patients with polytherapy, non-seizure free and symptomatic etiologies were more susceptible to recurrence of seizures after AED withdrawal. # 2005 BEA Trading Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. this outbreak, a total of 664 probable cases of SARS were reported to the Taiwan Center of Disease Control. Among them, 71 died. On February 21, the first identified SARS patient in Taiwan returned from travel to China. Beginning in mid-April, unrecognized cases of SARS led to a large nosocomial cluster and subsequent SARS-associated coronavirus transmission to health-care facilities and community settings. 1 On April 24, the Taiwan Department of Health directed the first phase of containment: hospital shutdown in one large municipal hospital in Taipei; another private hospital in Taipei was shut down 5 days later. 1 A patient, who visited the second Taipei hospital to be shut down moved from Taipei to Kaohsiung in late April and was admitted to our Kaohsiung Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital for renal stone. Unfortunately, she previously had been infected with SARS at the Taipei hospital and the virus was undiagnosed in our ward for 2 days. The delay of diagnosis led to a large nosocomial cluster of SARS in our hospital. The hospital closed all clinics including the emergency department, for 18 days, and visitors were barred. Yellow police tape barricaded all but one entrance to the hospital.",

Regarding chronic diseases, natural catastrophes still increase morbidity rates for hypertension, arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, and diabetes. 2, 3 The SARS outbreak was a difference experience. Patients were afraid to visit hospitals, pharmacies, and private clinics. Many patients even chose to stop taking drugs. Noncompliance became a major issue in the management of chronic diseases. Suddenly stopping medication may have a huge impact on the treatment of many diseases. For example, uncontrolled seizures are a major risk factor of mortality in epilepsy. 4, 5 Sudden withdrawal of antiepileptic drug (AED) is a risk factor for seizures, 6 even status epilepticus. 7 Irregular anticonvulsant consumption is worse than no therapy at all because of withdrawal seizures 8 or even sudden unexpected death. 9,10 Thus, seizure control in epileptic patients is a good example of the consequences of the SARS outbreak.",

            "text": "Drug withdrawal and compliance failure can cause seizures 6 or even status epilepticus. 7 We observed an increased frequency of seizures and status epilepticus in the group of ''stop drug/ attack''. The odds ratio for risk of seizures in the drug withdrawal group is 3.14. Although 20 cases already had been seizure-free for at least 6 months, this group, compared to the ''stop drug/no attack'' group had more partial seizures, symptomatic etiologies, and multiple drug therapy. These findings were in accordance with the study of risk of recurrence after antiepileptic drug withdrawal: ''symptomatic etiology is a major risk for the recurrence of seizures''. 11 Comparing the difference between the ''continue drug/no attack'' group and ''continue drug/ attack'' group, the former group had more seizurefree patients in the pre-SARS period. This group also had more patients with idiopathic etiology and monotherapy. The former group's seizures were more easily controlled than the latter group. Although SARS caused great distress throughout society, these epilepsy patients suffered exceptional stress. Seizure frequency in these two groups did not increase during the SARS period. Previous report regarding the influence of a flooding natural disaster on epilepsy shows stress to be significant factor for provocation seizures. 12 In the present study, comparison of different time period showed no evidence that stress was an aggravating factor for their seizures in these patients.",

The example of the drug withdrawal effects in epilepsy patients reflexes just one aspect of the overall impact of SARS outbreak. Other long-term diseases, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, might also have been seriously affected by SARS. We can conclude from present study that in the group of symptomatic etiologies, still had seizure during the treatment and polytherapy, the acute drug withdrawal will induce recurrence of seizures.",
