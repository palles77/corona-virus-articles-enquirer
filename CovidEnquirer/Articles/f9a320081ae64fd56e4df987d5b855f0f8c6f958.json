A 19-yearold previously healthy man had fever onset after 2 weeks of military training. Pneumonia became evident on the fifth day of fever under intravenous penicillin and oral minocycline therapy. Acute respiratory failure developed the next day with shock and acute renal and liver function deterioration, which resulted in death. Blood cultures on the third and fifth days grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. Serology revealed leptospirosis and scrub typhus. The emergence of melioidosis in Taiwan and this death without antibiotic treatment for melioidosis alert us that B. pseudomallei should be included as a possible pathogen of pneumonia and sepsis, especially after rural activities.",

            "text": "Fever onset after recent rural activities, both recreational and occupational, including hiking, farming, and military training, should raise the possibility of endemic pathogens acquired from soil, water, or insects. In southern Taiwan, infectious diseases that reportedly related to rural activities include scrub typhus, murine typhus, Q fever [1] , leptospirosis [2] , melioidosis [3] , dengue fever, and Hanta virus infection [4] . However, an early differential diagnosis based on the symptoms of these diseases is difficult and challenges the clinician to choose the critically important empirical therapy for potentially rapidly fatal diseases [1] . We report a fatal case of melioidosis, leptospirosis, and scrub typhus after military training and briefly review previous reports about these endemic diseases in Taiwan. A 19- year-old male military school student had fever and chills associated with a sore throat and cough from July 19, 2004 . This previously healthy man had attended an intensive battlefield training course that included crawling on hands and knees and lessons in a swimming pool at a military school in Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, 2 weeks before his illness. Because myalgia and abdominal pain developed and his fever did not subside after primary treatment at the school clinic, he was brought to a military medical center on July 20, 2004 . Physical examination revealed normal breathing sounds. Laboratory examination at admission showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.8 \u00d7 10 9 /L, hemoglobin at 151 g/L, and a platelet count of 191 \u00d7 10 9 /L. The differential leukocyte count showed predominant polymorphonuclear cells (segmented, 84.1%; lymphocytes, 7.1%; monocytes, 8.4%; basophils, 0.3%; eosinophils, 0.1%). Other laboratory results were abnormal liver function as shown by an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 108 U/L, an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 88 U/L, a high C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration (118 mg/L), and a high creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level (353 U/L; normal, 12-167 U/L). Other laboratory values were normal: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 90 mg/L; creatinine, 88.4 \u00b5mol/L; and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 212 U/L (normal, 180-460 U/L). Chest radiograph on arrival at the military hospital was normal.",

His hemoglobin was 143 g/L and platelet count was 156 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Arterial blood gas analysis when the patient was using a non-rebreathing mask with oxygen usage of 15 L/min had a pH of 7.36, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) of 25 mmHg, a partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2 ) of 66 mmHg, and a bicarbonate (HCO 3 ) concentration of 14.6 mmol/L. His prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were prolonged (20.4/11.1 and 70.1/31.4 seconds, case/control, respectively). He was sent to another medical center where physical examination revealed tachypnea, conjunctival suffusion, and crackling breathing sounds at night on July 23, 2004. His blood pressure was 109/48 mmHg, heart rate was 113/bpm, and respiratory rate was 26/min without an inotropic agent. Two chest radiographs 8 hours apart showed progressively increasing bilateral infiltration (Figures 1 and 2 ). His WBC count increased to 2.83 \u00d7 10 9 /L but platelet count dropped to 19 \u00d7 10 9 /L. Laboratory results illustrated deteriorated liver and renal function: (AST), 502 U/L; ALT, 224 U/L; BUN, 140 mg/L; and creatinine, 145 \u00b5mol/L. Other laboratory results indicating deteriorated condition were: CRP, 166 mg/L; LDH, 1,310 U/L; and CPK, 945 U/L. Impending respiratory failure was shown by arterial blood gas analysis: pH, 7.395; pCO 2 , 26.4 mmHg; pO 2 , 64.5 mmHg; and HCO 3 , 15.8 mmol/L. After supportive care for 8 hours and antimicrobial therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin and doxycycline, his condition continued to deteriorate with aggravated dyspnea that necessitated ventilator use. His blood pressure could not be maintained over 90/60 mmHg with the inotropic agents dopamine and norepinephrine. Worsening laboratory results were also noticed: BUN, 240 mg/L; creatinine, 292 \u00b5mol/L; bilirubin (Total/Direct), 71.5/30.78 \u00b5mol/L. His PT and APTT were more prolonged: 23/11.6 and 98.2/30.2 seconds (case/ control, respectively). A D-dimer level of 170.2 mg/L, He died 13 hours after transfer to the referral center, on the fifth day after fever onset.",

The Taiwan pneumonia guidelines suggest third-generation cephalosporins as one possible treatment for severe community-acquired pneumonia without mentioning the various third-generation cephalosporins [22] . In areas where melioidosis is endemic, empirical regimens that contain cefotaxime or ceftriaxone to treat severe communityacquired pneumonia or septicemia may not be appropriate [11] , especially when caring for patients exposed to melioidosis.

Scrub typhus has been known to cause infection in military personnel in Taiwan for 25 years [23] . Though leptospirosis and melioidosis were both formerly considered occupational diseases of military personnel [21, 24] , there has been no previous report of melioidosis in Taiwan military personnel after training. In southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung and Pingtung Counties, there were 79 cases of scrub typhus, 72 of Q fever, 41 of endemic typhus, 23 of leptospirosis, and 12 of melioidosis from 2002 to June 2004 (unpublished data from the Center for Disease Control, Taiwan). The recent emergence of melioidosis and its rarity result in a lack of familiarity with the culture characteristics of B. pseudomallei [25] and clinical alertness for melioidosis. This will cause delays in recognition, identification, diagnosis, and treatment. The incidence of melioidosis, known as a great mimicker for its wide spectrum of clinical manifestations [26] , could be underestimated due to a lack of awareness of the disease and relatively inaccessible and insufficiently rapid diagnostics in Taiwan, as indicated by the history of melioidosis in Thailand [25] .",

The appearance of pneumonia on the third day of septicemia indicated that the lung infection was secondary to hematogenous spread. The continuous bacteremia and the isolation of B. pseudomallei 12 hours before death indicated that the rapid fatality was attributable to septicemia. Mortality for scrub typhus with extensive pneumonitis and cyanosis unrelieved by oxygen is 22% in Taiwan [27] . The fatality rates for severe leptospirosis range from 5% to 40% [28] .
