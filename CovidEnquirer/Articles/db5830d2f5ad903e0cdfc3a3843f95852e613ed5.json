However, MERS-CoV remains a major global public health threat with continuing reports of new human MERS cases in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims from over 184 countries travel throughout the year. 29 Furthermore, a more intensive farm-based camel livestock system has emerged and there is a large, wellestablished trade in camels between countries at the Horn of Africa and countries in the Middle East. This has increased significantly, particularly following the lifting of the ban on live animal imports from Somalia by Saudi Arabia in 2009/2010. Somalia now exports some five million live animals every year to the Gulf Arab States (including 77 000 camels), making it the single biggest exporter of live animals in the world. The positive experience of reviving Somalia's livestock export industry through increased investment in animal disease prevention and control strategies highlights how effective the 'One Health' approach can be. Most of the African countries do not have the resources, expertise, or capacity, including laboratory facilities, to have active surveillance for MERS-CoV in place. In light of this, the need for increased vigilance and watchful surveillance for MERS-CoV in Sub-Saharan Africa has been highlighted previously. 30 Such an initiative could be supported through investments by countries that import large numbers of camels and other livestock from the region.",

The unprecedented outbreak was attributed to poor infection control measures at the hospitals. 30 Sequencing studies of the MERS-CoV isolate showed genetic recombination of MERS-CoV in the case exported from Korea to China. 32 However, recombination is a frequent event in MERS-CoV and the Korean outbreak is unlikely to represent a special form of the virus.

The intermittent detection and reporting of MERS cases in the community and sporadic nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks will require a more coordinated response plan to study clinical cases, conduct translational basic science and clinical trials research, and perform longitudinal sequencing studies from human and camel MERS-CoV isolates. A more collaborative MERS-CoV response plan is required to better define MERS-CoV epidemiology, transmission dynamics, molecular evolution, laboratory capacity, optimal treatment and prevention measures, and development of vaccines for humans and camels. 44 A better understanding of the prevailing disease ecology and investigations into the dynamics of infectious agents in wildlife could act as a better means of preventing outbreaks in livestock and people at source.",

A prime emphasis should be on developing awareness and response capacity in all countries and on promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and coordination.

This will also devolve current dominance of the global health agenda by Western groups and consortia and allow equitable partnerships to be established with long-term sustainability. The past year has seen some progress in research into MERS-CoV, but there remains a need for a more effective, coordinated, and multidisciplinary 'One Health' consortium to take forward MERS-CoV research on priority areas already defined by Saudi scientists 37, 38 and the WHO MERS Committee. 39 The establishment of regional 'One Health' Centres of excellence in the Middle East (under the League of Arab States) and at specific geographical locations in West, Central, East, and Southern Africa could make an important difference in mitigating the risks and factors that pose a risk to both human and animal health. Furthermore, any operational plan developed will contribute to strengthening the sentinel surveillance systems in Sub-Saharan Africa in the preparedness and response to potential outbreaks. Regional centres should be sufficiently empowered to manage the spectrum of 'One Health' approaches to zoonotic disease control in humans and animals, from behaviour change and social interventions for prevention to surveillance of infections and antimicrobial resistance, and preparedness and response to outbreaks.",
