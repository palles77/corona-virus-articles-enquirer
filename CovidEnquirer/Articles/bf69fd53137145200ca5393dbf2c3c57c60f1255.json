However, little is known about the entry route of influenza virus in differentiated epithelia, in vivo site of infection for influenza virus. Here, we show that in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney type II (MDCK II) cells, influenza virus has a specific utilization of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway and requires Eps15 for host cell entry.",

            "text": "Most animal viruses take advantage of the diverse cellular endocytic pathways to gain access to the host cells [1] [2] [3] . After virus binding to host cell receptors and being endocytosed, viruses can initiate replication only once they penetrate or fuse with the endosomal membrane [4] . A role of dynamin-dependent endocytosis for influenza virus entry was first demonstrated by examining the effect of dominant-negative (DN) dynamin, a small GTPase mediating the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane, on influenza virus entry in Mv-1 lung cells [5] . Studies from our group also showed that the infectivity of influenza viruses in cells expressing a DN mutant of Eps15 (epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15), which inhibits clathrin-dependent endocytosis specifically, was not impaired in HeLa cells [6] . When chemical inhibitors as well as DN mutant of caveolin-1 were used to disrupt caveolae-dependent endocytosis in host cells, influenza infectivity was retained as compared to that in untreated cells [6] . These observations led to the realization that non-clathrindependent, non-caveolae-dependent endocytic pathways exist for influenza virus entry, in addition to the classical clathrin-dependent pathway. More recently, with detailed dissection of influenza entry pathways independent of dynamin using pharmacological inhibitors, de Vries et al. discovered that influenza virus can utilize a macropinocytosis-like route in many cell types [7] . With the recent advancements of live cell imaging, individual influenza particles can be tracked in real time without disruption of endocytic pathways, a novel technique in discovering redundant or parallel endocytic pathways. With the new techniques, epsin1 (Epn1), an adaptor protein that interacts with clathrin, AP2 adaptors, and Eps15 in clathrin-coated pits, was demonstrated to be an influenza cargo-specific adaptor for entry via the clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) pathway in BSC-1 cells [8] . Examining the dynamics of the endocytic uptake also led to the conclusion that influenza viruses exploit different pathways with the same efficiency, and these non-classical, less-characterized pathways do not act as alternative pathways for influenza virus entry.",

Cellular actin and the microtubule network, as well as an array of cellular proteins, participate in the organization and maintenance of cell polarity. It is well recognized that influenza enters and buds from apical domain of polarized MDCK cells [10] . Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that actin microfilaments play different roles in influenza virus infection in polarized epithelial cells compared to non-polarized cells [11] . In contrast to their dispensable role in viral infection of non-polarized cells, intact actin filaments are obligatory for influenza virus infection in polarized epithelial cells. Since there are significant differences between polarized and nonpolarized cells with regard to receptor distribution, cytoskeletal structure, trafficking events, and mechanism of endocytosis, it is possible that our current knowledge of influenza virus entry in non-polarized cells, such as HeLa, MDCK, BSC-1 cells, does not completely apply to in vivo viral infection, which is initiated at the differentiated airway epithelial cells. Here we examined influenza virus entry pathways using pharmacological inhibitors and DN mutant proteins in fully polarized MDCK II cells, a well established and robust model for differentiated epithelia [12] .

Polarity was monitored by measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of the monolayer cultivated on the semi-permeable filter, using an EVOMX meter along with electrodes for cell culture inserts (World Precision Instruments). Before measurement, culture media was changed to fresh warm media for all filter inserts. After being confluent for 3-4 days on Transwell filters, MDCK II reached an average TEER of 230 ohms.cm 2 , which was consistent with observations in the literature [13] . MDCK cells (ATCC CCL34) that were not polarized displayed both fibroblast-like and epithelia-like morphology were used as control, due to their inability to form a tight monolayer.

Chlorpromazine (CPZ), which prevents clathrin assembly, has been widely used to block CME including studies on the entry mechanism of influenza viruses in non-polarized cells [1] . Dynasore has an inhibitory effect on GTPase activity of dynamin with low cell toxicity [15] . Since the discovery of dynasore, it has been widely used as specific dynamin inhibitor for entry studies of various virus [16] [17] [18] . CPZ or dynasore were used to treat fully polarized MDCK II cells and non-polarized MDCK-CCL34 cells for 30 min before infection with influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1). At 5 h post infection, cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. MDCK-CCL34 cells were more sensitive to the toxicity of CPZ than MDCK II cells; thus lower concentrations of CPZ were used to treat MDCK-CCL34 cells. The quantity of inhibitors used in the treatment did not affect cell viability (data not shown). Treatment with CPZ on both MDCK-CCL34 and MDCK II caused a substantial reduction on the number of NP expressing cells after influenza infection (Fig. 1A) However, dynasore treatment had a more obvious impact on polarized MDCK II cells than their non-polarized counterpart (Fig. 1B) . This evidence indicates a potential role of dynamin in the entry pathway of polarized MDCK II cells, while non-polarized MDCK-CCL34 cells do not depend as much on dynamin usage for entry. The effect of CPZ and dynamin on the canine kidney cells were further confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. 1C) .",

However, we wished to examine specific components of the CME pathway. Conventional transfection methods with cationic lipid or adenovirus transduction are either of low transfection efficiency or not ideal for our study. To overcome the difficulty of recombinant protein expression, we used electroporation on monolayer cells as described in [14] . We electroporated WT or DN constructs of dynamin 2 ( Fig. 2A) , Eps15 (Fig. 2B) , or Epn1 (Fig. 2C) into fully polarized MDCK II cells and infected these cells with influenza virus at a MOI of 5 after 18 h post electroporation. Cells were then fixed and stained for confocal microscopy after 5 h of infection. Expression of the DN form of dynamin 2 or Epn1 resulted in a statistically significant reduction of percentage of GFP or EYFP expressing cells that were positive for viral NP expression, compared to the control WT version of the respective construct (Fig. 2D) . Unlike in nonpolarized cells such as HeLa cells described in a previous study [6] , Eps15-D95/295-GFP DN construct expression in MDCK II cells also significantly reduced the percentage of cells infected with influenza virus and expressing viral NP, comparing to its WT counterpart Eps15-DIIID2-GFP expressing cells.",

To examine whether influenza virus can also utilize macropinocytosis in polarized MDCK II cells, we used 5-ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA), a macropinocytosis inhibitor that inhibits Na + /H + exchanger activity, to treat the canine kidney cells before infecting with influenza virus [20] . By examination of viral protein M1 in whole cell lysate using western blot analysis, we found that neither MDCK-CCL34 cells nor MDCK II cells were significantly inhibited by EIPA, compared to leading control, regardless of drug treatment concentrations (Fig. 3) . Our data suggest that similar to non-polarized MDCK cells, there exist redundant entry pathways (presumably CME) in polarized MDCK cells and macropinocytosis is not a preferential major pathway utilized by influenza virus in the cells used in this study.",

To examine whether influenza virus enters polarized MDCK II cells via caveolae-independent entry pathway as in previous studies on non-polarized cells, we first treated the MDCK-CCL34 or MDCK II cells with different concentrations of caveolae-inhibiting drugs such as methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MBCD) and nystatin. As revealed by expression of viral protein M1 on western blot, treatment with high concentrations of MBCD were able to inhibit both polarized MDCK II cells and non-polarized MDCK-CCL34 cells (Fig. 4A) . In contrast, nystatin did not have an inhibitory effect on either cell type. To examine the caveolar-mediated pathway more specifically in polarized MDCK II cells, we electroporated GFP-tagged caveolin-1 WT or DN plasmids into polarized MDCK II cells before infection with influenza virus. Caveolin-1 is a major structural protein in the caveolae. Using confocal microscopy, both Cav1 WT and Cav1 DN expressing cells were able to be infected by influenza virus as shown by the positive signal of viral NP in the transfected cells ( Fig. 4C and D) . The discrepancy in influenza virus infectivity in MDCK II cell after treatment with MBCD and with nystatin may be due to the discrete modes of action by the two drugs: MBCD inhibition of influenza virus entry in both MDCK-CCL34 and MDCK II cells was not by inhibiting caveolae-dependent endocytosis, by altering the structure of cholesterol-rich domain in plasma membrane. A similar observation was also described in SARS-coronavirus entry studies [21, 22] . Taken together, our data demonstrated that, similar to non-polarized MDCK cells, influenza virus does not enter polarized MDCK II through caveolae-dependent endocytosis.",

Polarized epithelial cells are usually refractory to transfection and more difficult to work with compared to non-polarized cells. Components in the CME pathway have shown to be regulators of cell polarity [23, 24] , so to avoid DN cellular proteins disrupting formation of proper cellular polarity, we chose to introduce the DN constructs to the MDCK II cells after the cells had formed a tight monolayer and were fully polarized. Conventional transfection methods utilizing cationic lipid often yields low transfection efficiency in polarized epithelial cells (data not shown). Adenovirus transduction to introduce recombinant protein into polarized epithelia is another frequently used method.

Unexpectedly, a large portion of polarized MDCK II cells expressing Eps15 DN were not able to be infected by influenza virus (Fig. 3D ). Eps15 is an adaptor protein that interacts with Epsin1, AP180, and synaptojanin via the Eps homology (EH) domains and recruits cargo adaptor protein AP-2 to plasma membrane [29] . The inhibitory effect of Eps15-D95/295 DN protein on influenza virus entry in polarized MDCK II cells suggests that Eps15 plays an important role for influenza virus entry in the CME pathway. The requirement of functional Eps15 for influenza virus in clathrin-coated pits could involve a different adaptor protein that is associated with Eps15.",
