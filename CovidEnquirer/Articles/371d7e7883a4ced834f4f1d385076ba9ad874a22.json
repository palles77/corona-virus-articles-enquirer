Objectives: To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized children with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China from June 2017 to May 2018. Study design: A 12-month longitudinal, retrospective study on HAdV, typed by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the hexon gene's hypervariable region (typing was merely performed by sequencing of the hexon neutralization epitope and thus genotypes could not be identified unequivocally), associated with ARTI was performed. The epidemiological and clinical data of different types of HAdV were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. Results: HAdV was detected in 330 (3.71%) of the 8906 specimens, with most (88.48%, 292/330) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 3 years old. HAdV were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring. 11 types were identified, with HAdV-2 (33.33%, 110/330) as the predominant type, followed by HAdV-3 (21.21%, 70/330) and HAdV-7 (13.94%, 46/330). Of the 330 HAdV-positive specimens, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, most commonly rhinovirus (HRV) (58.7%, 145/ 247). Additionally, patients with HAdV-7 positive had longer duration of fever than HAdV-2 or -3 positive patients. Conclusions: During the study period, HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the predominant types identified from children with ARTI in Hebei Province. Pediatric patients with HAdV-7 positive may not present more severe clinical outcome except a longer duration of fever.",

HAdV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Mastadenovirus genus (Adenoviridae family). There are currently seven different HAdV species (A to G), including 103 HAdV types (HAdV types up to type number 51 were defined as serotypes and higher type numbers were defined as genotypes) (http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/). HAdV-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14 and the re-emergent type HAdV-55 are known to cause ARTI [4] [5] [6] . Although HAdV is associated with mild to moderate disease in most cases, types 3 and 7 were increasingly reported [7, 8] associated with severe, and even life-threatening infections and outbreaks. Therefore, investigating the epidemiological and clinical manifestations of different types of HAdV infections is helpful to the prevention and control of HAdV circulating.",

Severe CAP was defined as an CAP that presented with one of the following clinical presentations: oxygen saturation < 92%, cyanosis; respiratory rate > 70 (infants) or 50 (older children) breaths/min; significant tachycardia for level of fever; prolonged central capillary refill time > 2 s; difficulty in breathing; intermittent apnoea (infants), grunting; not feeding (infants); chronic conditions (eg, congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease of prematurity, chronic respiratory conditions leading to infection such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, immune deficiency).

Such discrepant HAdV detection rates were easy to be explained by different regions. Previous studies from Beijing and Guangzhou [9, 10] revealed that HAdV infections occurred throughout the year with the highest prevalence in the summer. However, a peak positive rate occurred during March-April in the present study, which is consistent with another study that has reported seasonal peak for HAdV infections in spring in Northern China [13] . We found that HAdV-positives cases detected predominantly (88.48%) in children under 3 years of age, with a peaking in children aged 1-2 years (P < 0.001), demonstrating that most children become infected by HAdV at an early age. A recent repeated cross sectional study [14] drew similar findings that the HAdV positive rate of children at the age of < 3 years was 63.51% and the rate of HAdV infection peaking in children aged l-3 years in Northern China (P = 0.021).",

Similarly, through a comprehensive series of assays in vitro and in vivo as well as clinical correlates, a study in Chongqing [20] shown that HAdV-7 replicates more robustly than HAdV-3, and promotes an exacerbated cytokine response, causing a more severe airway inflammation. Our results revealed that patients with HAdV-7 positive experienced longer durations of fever than HAdV-2 or HAdV-3 positive patients, which was consistent with the results reported by Taiwan [15] .
