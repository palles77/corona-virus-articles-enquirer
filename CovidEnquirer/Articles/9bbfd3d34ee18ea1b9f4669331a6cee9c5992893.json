By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity but also aided the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 5 . However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting a potential for pre-or oligosymptomatic transmission 6-8 .",

Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat-and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat-and lung samples of one same patient. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 6-12 days, but was not followed by a rapid decline of viral loads. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.",

The predominant expression of ACE2 in the lower respiratory tract is believed to have determined the natural history of SARS as a lower respiratory tract infection. Whereas positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract has been described 9 , these observations do not address principal differences between SARS and COVID-19 in terms of clinical pathology. The here-studied patients were enrolled because they acquired their infections upon known close contact to an index case, thereby avoiding representational biases due to symptom-based case definitions. All patients were treated in a single hospital in Munich, Germany. Virological testing was done by two closely-collaborating laboratories using the same standards of technology for RT-PCR and virus isolation, confirming each other's results based on almost all individual samples. Due to extremely high congruence of results, all data are presented together. Only the serological data are based on results from one laboratory. The patients are part of a larger cluster of epidemiologically-linked cases that occurred after January 23 rd , 2020 in Munich, Germany, as discovered on January 27 th (B\u00f6hmer et al., accompanying manuscript) . The present study uses samples taken during the clinical course in the hospital, as well as from initial diagnostic testing before admission. In cases when this initial diagnostic testing was done by other laboratories, the original samples were retrieved and re-tested under the rigorous quality standards of the present study.",

To obtain proof of active virus replication in absence of histopathology, we conducted RT-PCR tests to identify viral subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgRNA) directly in clinical samples. Viral sgRNA is only transcribed in infected cells and is not packaged into virions, therefore indicating the presence of activelyinfected cells in samples. Viral sgRNA was compared against viral genomic RNA in the same sample. In sputum samples taken on days 4/5, 6/7, and 8/9, a time in which active replication in sputum was obvious in all patients as per longitudinal viral load courses (see below), mean normalized sgRNA per genome ratios were ~0.4% ( Figure 1G ). Swabs taken up to day 5 were in the same range, while no sgRNA was detectable in swabs thereafter. Together, these data indicate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the throat during the first 5 days after symptoms onset. No, or only minimal, indication of replication in stool was obtained by the same method ( Figure 1G ).",

At the same time, the concurrent use of ACE-2 as a receptor by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to a highly similar excretion kinetic in sputum, with active replication in the lung. SARS-CoV was found in sputum at mean concentrations of 1.2-2.8x10 6 copies per mL, which corresponds to observations made here 13 . Whereas proof of replication by histopathology is awaited, extended tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 with replication in the throat is strongly supported by our studies of sgRNAtranscribing cells in throat swab samples, particularly during the first 5 days of symptoms.",

As in SARS and MERS, IgM was not detected significantly earlier than IgG in immunofluorescence, which might in part be due to technical reasons as the higher avidity of IgG antibodies outcompetes IgM for viral epitopes in the assay. IgG depletion can only partially alleviate this effect. Because IFA is a laborintensive method, ELISA tests should be developed as a screening test. Neutralization testing is necessary to rule out cross-reactive antibodies directed against endemic human coronaviruses. Based on frequently low neutralizing antibody titers observed in coronavirus infection 12,25 , we have here developed a particularly sensitive plaque reduction neutralization assay.
