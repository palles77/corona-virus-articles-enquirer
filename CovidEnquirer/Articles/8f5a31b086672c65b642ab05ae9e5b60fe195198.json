We aimed to determine the duration of start-up procedures and barriers encountered for an observational study focused upon such infectious outbreaks. Materials and methods: At 1 pediatric and 5 adult intensive care units, we measured durations from protocol receipt to a variety of outbreak research milestones, including research ethics board (REB) approval, data sharing agreement (DSA) execution, and patient study screening initiation. Results: The median (interquartile range) time from site receipt of the protocol to REB submission was 73 (30-126) days; to REB approval, 158 (42-188) days; to DSA completion, days; and to study screening initiation, 293 (269-391) days. The median time from REB submission to REB approval was 43 (13-85) days. The median time for all start-up procedures was 335 (188-335) days. Conclusions: There is a lengthy start-up period required for outbreak-focused research. Completing DSAs was the most time-consuming step. A reactive approach to newly emerging threats such as Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus will likely not allow sufficient time to initiate research before most outbreaks are advanced.",

            "text": "New emerging and reemerging infections such as Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and Zika virus are a concern for the public, clinicians, health systems, and public health agencies. Outbreaks and pandemics are perceived to occur at increasing frequency; however, they remain unpredictable in their time and location of onset [1] . Outbreaks increase patient morbidity and mortality, and cause additional burden on health care workers, facilities, and health agencies [2] [3] [4] . Surveillance can identify cases at an early stage and lead to prevention of broader spread. Severe acute respiratory syndrome [5] ; pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009-2010 [6] ; and, more recently, Ebola virus [7] , MERS-CoV [8] , and Zika virus have been characterized by challenges initiating observational research and a near inability to rapidly undertake interventional trials necessary to inform best practice and improve care of patients [9] [10] [11] . This has prompted calls from patients, clinicians, funders, and policy makers to improve preparedness, including the capacity to undertake real-time research during such events. However, conducting studies and trials involves time-consuming start-up steps such as development of study protocol, establishing a budget and obtaining funding, research ethics board (REB) approval, organizing multisite collaboration, and data sharing agreements. The objective of this study was to determine the delay from protocol completion to study initiation and determine time spent in each of the necessary steps to identify and collect data in real time for new and emerging infection-related critical illness.",

It took sites approximately 2\u00bd months after protocol receipt to be ready to submit to their REB yet only approximately 1\u00bd months for REB approval. Our findings indicate that despite an existing in-ICU infrastructure and capability for real-time data collection and reporting, observational research during an outbreak or pandemic is at risk of failing because of the time required for start-up procedures. Seasonal influenza outbreaks provide a compelling annual example. If we do not initiate the study start-up process immediately after influenza season, we will not be ready for screening at the next.",

Efficient research initiation during an outbreak or pandemic is critical considering the potential for outbreak expansion and greater morbidity and mortality without better understanding of risk factors for illness and transmission, clinical course, outcomes, and responses to treatment. Although we studied timelines to initiate observational research, it is possible and in fact likely that start-up time for a clinical experimental trial would be even longer.

Some of these reasons include (1) developing the study protocol and case report forms in a short span of time [13] , (2) preparing REB applications, (3) fixed meeting dates of institutional ethics boards followed by important and necessary back-and-forth communications [16] , (4) drafting and finalizing the data sharing agreements, (5) lack of parallel reviewing of REB applications and data sharing agreements across institutions, and (6) finalizing budget and arranging funding. There may be several possible ways to overcome these delays and be prepared ahead of time to conduct an outbreak-related study or trial. First, there is a need to have research-ready protocols-inwaiting for periods when seasonal or outbreak-related infections increase. This can be achieved through research-ready outbreak-related observational studies and trials using national and international networks [19] , undertaking preemptive REB review of generic outbreakrelated observational study case report forms and protocols, establishing data sharing agreements where necessary ahead of time, and helping other centers similarly prepare.",

            "text": "Although ethical approval is mandatory for research involving human subjects, there are provisions in many jurisdictions for exempt reviews for studies involving public health emergencies, typically consisting of observational studies collecting already available and anonymized data [20, 21] . Similarly, collecting data as \"quality Table 1 Median time (in days) spent from receipt of protocol, REB submission, and finalization of data sharing agreements to task completion at study sites assurance\" or \"quality improvement\" does not require REB approval in some provinces. If a multicenter observational study intends to collect nonidentifiable data from available information collected as a part of routine clinical care, which can be rapidly and efficiently used to generate new evidence, mechanisms are often in place to grant rapid assessments, and there exist guidelines to exempt certain studies from certain aspects of the review process [22] . Another approach will be to identify certain steps that take the longest duration among start-up procedures. In this study, we identified that data sharing agreements took 6 to 9 months to be fully executed. We found that some sites had limited research administration and regulatory staff, that some sites were busy with other ongoing research-related activities and that starting an unplanned research project introduced substantial demand on a system with already stretched capacity. Hospitals often have unique research administrative structures. Some university-affiliated hospitals were required to obtain REB approval from a university authority first and then from the local hospital to proceed, whereas others required data sharing agreements to be finalized before issuing the final REB approval. Improving efficiency and parallel administrative activities for certain types of low-risk observational studies are a potential mechanism to mitigate delays in start-up procedures. Centralized ethics approvals for pandemic research at provincial, state, and national levels may also help to improve efficiency and lessen workload for individual sites [23] . Having durable (5-10 years) protocols and generic approvals, to include anticipated ranges of pathogens and/or outbreaks meeting prespecified criteria, may also be more appropriate for outbreak and pandemic-related research as opposed to annual reapproval. Having a tiered case report form that seeks to collect either a minimal amount of core clinical information or more detailed data, depending upon the clinical research resources of individual sites, might assist in both start-up and actual study-related workload and translate to greater enthusiasm, capacity, and shorter start-up times. The World Health Organization-International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium Clinical Characterization Protocol provides one such example [19] .",

This is the first study to report the actual duration of time spent in each step to initiate multisite outbreak-related research. Limitations to this study include lack of qualitative data from participating site research staff to better understand their perspectives regarding delays. Future studies may focus upon this complementary aspect. Also, the study was limited to major hospitals already carrying out critical care research, and therefore, we may be underestimating required timelines among centers without staff already familiar with the processes necessary for study start-up. Finally, although this study was focused upon surveillance of SARI during a period of global concern for many outbreak-causing pathogens-influenza A (H7N9, H1N1, H5N1) and MERS-CoV-it was initiated during an interoutbreak period in Canada; start-up time may be shorter or longer during an actual outbreak and has generalizable lessons for nonrespiratory outbreaks such as Ebola and Zika virus.",
