            "text": "We have performed full-field cryo X-ray microscopy in the water window photon energy range on vaccinia virus (VACV) infected cells to produce tomographic reconstructions. PtK2 cells were infected with a GFP-expressing VACV strain and frozen by plunge fast freezing. The infected cells were selected by light fluorescence microscopy of the GFP marker and subsequently imaged in the X-ray microscope under cryogenic conditions. Tomographic tilt series of X-ray images were used to yield three-dimensional reconstructions showing different cell organelles (nuclei, mitochondria, filaments), together with other structures derived from the virus infection. Among them, it was possible to detect viral factories and two types of viral particles related to different maturation steps of VACV (immature and mature particles), which were compared to images obtained by standard electron microscopy of the same type of cells. In addition, the effect of radiation damage during X-ray tomographic acquisition was analyzed. Thin sections studied by electron microscopy revealed that the morphological features of the cells do not present noticeable changes after irradiation. Our findings show that cryo X-ray nano-tomography is a powerful tool for collecting three-dimensional structural information from frozen, unfixed, unstained whole cells with sufficient resolution to detect different virus particles exhibiting distinct maturation levels.",

            "text": "The process of virus infection of eukaryotic cells is a classical example on how the coupling in the host cell of the assembly of viral structural components to their spatial and temporal organization leads to efficient production of progeny. Viral components are produced under a temporal control, and they are subsequently transported to the proper assembly sites using cellular pathways. These areas define assembly factories where the concentration and access of viral components are optimized. During these steps there are extensive interactions between viral and cellular components that have been studied for decades as a main target to design antiviral strategies, as well as an attractive model system to understand the molecular basis for cell control and macromolecular interactions. In particular, the role of cell membranes in the viral assembly has been extensively documented for many viral systems, including the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for rotavirus, the role of ER-Golgi intermediate compartment for coronavirus and poxvirus assembly and maturation, and the plasma membrane in the production of retrovirus, orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus, among others (reviewed in Hunter, 2007) .",

While improved visible light microscopy has been widely used for whole cell structural analyses of viral infection, the increasing demand of higher resolution to get deeper insights into these processes have led to the incremental use of powerful methods, as electron cryo-tomography (Lucic et al., 2005) , revealing molecular details albeit with the cost of a reduction of the complexity or scale of the sample, while increasing the sample preparation difficulty. The inherent limitation of the analysis at the cellular level (sample thicknesses about 300-500 nm for electron microscopes), together with the consequent lack of quantification due to the sample limitations imposed by high resolution methods, have become critical problems for the correlation of these qualitative structural data with the quantitative data derived from whole populations using biochemical, genetic and proteome analyses (Baumeister and Steven, 2000; Martone et al., 2003) .",

Different super-resolution visible light fluorescence microscopy methods (Galbraith and Galbraith, 2011; Jones et al., 2011) , and the use of improved sectioning methods in electron tomography (Pierson et al., 2010; Rigort et al., 2010) are opening new possibilities for the comprehensive study of the cellular cartography. The use of X-ray microscopy is another powerful alternative, based on the high penetration power of soft X-rays in the water window photon energy range (just below the O absorption K edge at 543 eV) in hydrated biological material (sample thicknesses 610 microns). The use of diffractive optics in full-field X-ray microscopes (Chao et al., 2005; Rehbein et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 1995) , together with the incorporation of cryogenic procedures for sample preparation and data acquisition (Schneider, 1998) , have led to the recent success of X-ray microscopy for 3-D imaging of cells yielding tomographic reconstructions at resolutions in the order of 20-30 nm (Hanssen et al., 2010; Larabell and Le Gros, 2003; Larabell and Nugent, 2010; Schneider et al., 2002 Schneider et al., , 2003 Schneider et al., , 2010 Weiss et al., 2000) .",

A quantitative estimation for such a resolution was experimentally obtained by comparison of the tomographic reconstructions of a large and complex virus (VACV) using both X-ray and electron microscopies ). The resolution from X-ray tomograms using a zone plate of 25 nm was found to be only 3,7 times lower than that obtained from electron microscopy (i.e. 25.7 nm vs 6.7 nm), thus opening the possibility to resolve structural features of small cellular complexes and aggregates in whole cells at resolutions between light and electron microscopies. As those resolution estimations were done on purified virus preparations in buffer, a critical question is whether such features could be distinguished within the complex and crowded cellular media. In this work we show the possibility to detect VACV individual particles in the cytoplasm of an infected whole cell without chemical fixation, sectioning or labeling by cryo X-ray tomography with an estimated 3D-resolution up to 55 nm using a zone plate of 40 nm, which allowed fulfilling better depth of focus requirements.",

The virus particle is relatively large (360 \u00c2 270 \u00c2 250 nm 3 ), enclosing a core with a double stranded DNA containing more than 200 open reading frames coding for viral specific proteins (Cyrklaff et al., 2005; Moss, 2007) . The assembly of VACV is very complex, starting with the modification of cellular membranes at the ER by incorporation of viral proteins, giving rise to crescents. These modified membranes evolve to rounded immature virus particles (IV) which contain a complex viroplasm. The IVs incorporate viral DNA and they enter in a complex maturation process involving the reorganization of viral envelopes, the formation of a distinct core, and a severe change in the overall structure, yielding the characteristic brick-shaped mature virus (MV). These particles, although infective, are not the final form of the viral maturation: they are able to interact with the trans-Golgi network to produce a wrapped form of the virus (WV), which is transported towards the outer plasma membrane of the cell using a kinesinbased microtubular mechanism. Later in the infection cycle, the virus particles associate to the cell membrane and are further ejected from the cells using actin polymerization to efficiently spread the virus along large microvilli (reviewed in Flint et al., 2009; Moss, 2007) .",

            "text": "The maturation process of VACV is carried out entirely in the cell cytoplasm, and it involves multiple sets of temporal interactions between cellular membranes and other organelles with viral components. Due to the complexity of these interactions, their study has been difficult and several controversies related to the total number of viral membranes and their cellular origin are still open (reviewed in Rodriguez et al., 2006) . Part of these problems are derived from the fact that most of the studies were based on the very limited and partial information that is retrieved from ultra-thin sections of 50-100 nm from a total cell thickness of 10-20 lm or more. Furthermore, the electron microscope images from those sections overlap their structural features in two-dimensional projections, thus leading to conflicting interpretations. The use of electron tomography was a main step towards the understanding of the virus structure (Cyrklaff et al., 2005) , assembly ) and disassembly (Cyrklaff et al., 2007) . Tomographic reconstructions reveal genuine three-dimensional information, thus avoiding the superposition of information found in projected images. Nevertheless, even in these cases the information is retrieved from a small percentage of the volume of the whole cell, thus preventing the quantitative analysis of the viral life cycle at the cellular level. In an attempt to circumvent these problems, we have explored the combination of fast freezing of VACV infected cells with X-ray microscopy to get insights into the viral infection process at the whole cell level taking profit of the penetration power of X-rays. The VACV structural knowledge obtained by the analysis of the same cell type by standard electron microscopy approaches allowed us to identify the viral related structures within the X-ray tomograms. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect different types of viral assembly intermediates within the cytoplasm of whole cells. In addition, we studied the effect of radiation damage by TEM analysis of plastic embedded thin sections of X-ray irradiated cells. The results revealed no noticeable changes in the cellular ultrastructure during the tomographic data acquisition by X-ray microscopy.",

Eight hours after serum removal, PtK2 cells present a standard aspect albeit with some vacuolization (Fig. 1a, b, d). The thickness of these flatten cells is around 3-10 lm, depending on the cellular area, thus in the order of magnitude required for efficient freezing and X-ray transmission microscopy using the water window energy range (Kirz and Rarback, 1985; Schneider, 1998) . Infection of the flat PtK2 cells by MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) strain clearly increases vacuolization, as readily seen in visible light microscopy ( Fig. 1c) and in electron microscopy of thin sections of these cells (Fig. 1e) . This enhanced vacuolization is likely due to apoptotic events induced by virus infection, since the gene F1L encoding an inhibitor of apoptosis was deleted in the viral genome. Nevertheless, in spite of these vacuoles, the cells support VACV infection, as viral related structures were seen in these cells. To confirm that PtK2 cells were able to fully sustain virus infection, a virus growth-curve was performed. Cells were infected with MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) strain, and the virus production was measured at different times after infection using an immunostaining assay in DF-1 cells (Fig. 1f, g) . The kinetics of viral production found for VACV wild type and the two strains (MVA and the GFP containing MVA-C-DF1C(GFP)) were identical up to 24 h after infection, although differences in virus titers were observed at 72 h (probably due to the extensive cytopathic effect and the apoptosis events referred above). In addition, the plaque-size morphology between MVA and MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) were also similar. The findings of Fig. 1 demonstrate that PtK2 cells infected with MVA-C-DF1C(GFP) is a good system to follow virus infection and the assembly cycle.",

The cells were collected after 18 h post-infection and fast frozen by liquid ethane plunging. The frozen cells were cryo-substituted as described in Section 2, and the samples were sectioned parallel to the substrate plane at different heights to study their preservation level using electron microscopy. Fig. 2 shows the aspect of different sections at increasing distances up to 3 lm towards the interior of the cell from the basal plane in contact with the substrate. The images show a uniform preservation with an overall good preservation of the cell cytoplasm and a reasonable delineation of mitochondria, vacuoles and filamentous structures.

This strain expresses the fluorescent protein GFP and, thus, infected cells can be easily detected by ''in vivo'' fluorescence (Fig. 3b) . This signal was used to map the position of the infected cells in the framework of the grid marks at room temperature. After freezing, the grids were transferred into the X-ray microscope under liquid nitrogen, and grid marks were used to locate the infected cell coordinates. This location was then cross-checked using the fluorescence microscope integrated in the X-ray microscope, as the GFP signal was clearly visible after plunge freezing (Fig. 3c) . Full-field projection images were collected from 10 to 15 lm thick frozen samples containing the infected cells as shown in Fig. 3d .

The first one was cryo-substitution and Lowicryl embedding, where the frozen cells were embedded in resin at low temperature, thus minimizing the dehydration induced effects. This preparation method closely mimics the sample cryo-fixation used for X-ray microscopy. The sections obtained from these samples were lightly stained with uranyl acetate to increase the contrast for a better visualization (Fig. 4e-h) . The second procedure consists on a more standard chemically fixed embedding in epoxy resin for sectioning.

Analysis of the radiation damage induced during X-ray tomographic data acquisition Acquisition of images during X-ray microscopy, even under cryogenic conditions, involves the exposure of the sample to radiation, thus generating chemical and physical damages to it. The average irradiation for the acquisition of an image in the HZB Xray microscope used in these experiments (beamline U41 at BESSY II, 5 \u00c2 10 8 photons/lm 2 at 510 eV) might be estimated to around 5 \u00c2 10 7 Gy per image, which amounts up to around 5 \u00c2 10 9 Gy for the collection of a complete tomography data set. Although the radiation damage problem has been thoroughly studied in electron cryo-microscopy, much less detailed measurements exist in the case of X-ray microscopy. To get an insight into how this radiation level might affect the structural information retrieved by X-ray microscopy at the magnification and resolution attainable in these experiments, we compared the ultrastructure of samples obtained before and after X-ray irradiation using electron microscopy of thin sections from these samples.",

The grids were kept under liquid nitrogen and subsequently they were freeze-substituted and plastic embedded as described in Section 2. The areas were selected using the grid features (related to the regions of interest defined by the correlative microscopy described above), and then serial ultrathin sections were produced and processed for observation by electron microscopy (Fig 7) .

The combination of methods based on cryogenic sample preparation and image acquisition at low temperatures has led to the three-dimensional reconstruction of frozen cells revealing their internal structures (Hanssen et al., 2010; Larabell and Le Gros, 2003; Schneider et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2000) . Here we have studied the structure of cells infected with VACV in an attempt to get clues on the possibility to detect relatively small structural features within the whole cell cytoplasm. Although purified vaccinia virus particles were seen by cryo X-ray tomography without any fixative or staining , their detection within the crowded cellular cytoplasm was not evident. The combination of light, electron and X-ray microscopy allows following different cellular features at complementary 3D resolution levels without using any fixative or contrasting reagent. To correlate the different microscopy methods we used a fluorescent probe associated to the expression of GFP by an engineered strain of VACV. Regions of interest were detected by means of the fluorescence characteristic of the infected cells, which were observed in the fluorescent light microscope at room temperature as well as after freezing the cells, allowing us to identify the relevant cells under the X-ray microscope using grid coordinates marks.",

The resolution level attained in our cryo X-ray tomograms is such that it has been possible to detect cytoplasmic regions modified by the viral infection (viral factories), as well as two distinct types of viral particles, the IVs and the MVs. The morphological features shown in the frozen, unstained samples reconstructed from X-ray tomograms are comparable, albeit at a slightly lower resolution, to the structures described by electron microscopy of thin sections of chemically fixed and stained material. However, the main difference between these electron and X-ray microscopy results is that the former correspond to 70 nm sections of the cell, while the later derive from whole 10 to 12 lm thick cells, thus avoiding the biased interpretation derived from the analyses of partial cellular volumes, and opening the way to quantitative studies of the viral infection process at improved resolutions, including also the macromolecular events associated to the cytopathic effects produced in the course of virus infections.

The use of cryogenic temperatures lowers the damage, but it is a main limiting factor for these microscopy methods that has to be minimized using as low dosages as possible to collect useful information (Knapek and Dubochet, 1980) . We have done a preliminary estimation of the effect of X-ray irradiation during tomographic data collection by comparison of the ultrastructure observed by electron microscopy from thin sections of infected cells derived either from X-ray irradiated or non-irradiated material. By collecting the samples after X-ray tomography, and using the marks on the HZB2 microscope grid to identify those cells which were irradiated during tomographic tilt series, we embedded those areas in resin for thin sectioning and observation under the electron microscope. The ultrastructure revealed by electron microscopy showed an overall similar aspect of the cytoplasmic background, while the main structural features of the cell organelles remained basically similar to those seen in non-irradiated areas. Even the structural details characteristic of the two types of viral-related particles (IVs and MVs) were identical with and without X-ray irradiation. Our results show for the first time that the irradiated areas preserve most of the ultrastructure as defined at the thin section electron microscopy level. Further detailed analysis will be required in the future to fully understand the effect of X-ray radiation damage during cryo X-ray imaging at improved resolutions.",
