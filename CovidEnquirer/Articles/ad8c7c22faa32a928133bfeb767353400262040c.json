These relationships vary by program and school, with the majority providing practical 87 training opportunities, such as global health clinical rotations for medical students and residents, 88 direct service delivery engagements, research opportunities in the health sciences, and diverse 89 training collaborations 11 . Some question the ethics of these engagements as forms of \"medical 90 tourism,\" considering the population health status in the US pales in comparison to other high-91 income nations 12 13 and because a growing number of foreign-born and foreign-trained 92 physicians immigrate to the US to practice medicine in underserved communities 14 . This 93 healthcare workforce exchange may harm healthcare systems 15 16 , and displace financial 94 resources 17 . 95 With the proliferation of global health programs has come a growing body of research 96 and literature examining the impact of global health programs on non-US communities 18-22 and 97 how these programs influence the values and perspectives of short-term global health 98 participants 23 .

They perceived a decline in the US healthcare system 314 and that global health work was seen as a more personally beneficial and altruistic endeavor: 315 \"We do not practice evidence-based medicine anymore [in the US], we practice lawsuit-based 316 and insurance-based medicine now. I am a hired gun here. I collect a paycheck and then go back 317 [abroad].\" (GHP #3, interview) Page 14 of 30 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open",

The participants responded in a variety of ways -330 most of which contained elements of doubt, cynicism, disinterest, or a perceived greater ability 331 to support impactful changes to foreign healthcare systems. Discussing their personal 332 experiences with the US healthcare system, one participant noted: \"There are so many competing 333 agendas, and it is the big money that is going to win out. I hate to sound cynical.\" (PL #7, 334 interview) Another participant explained that their work providing technical expertise to the 335 Kenyan Health Ministry \"can make public health decisions that have a big impact much more 336 easily than anybody here can have.\" (PL #6, interview) Several participants discussed how they 337 had previously been involved in US healthcare advocacy and reform work, but had either lost 338interest, were too busy with their global health work, or had felt that they were able to bring 339 about more meaningful reforms in non-US healthcare systems: \"One of the things is I used toPage 15 of 30 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open",

Furthermore, five interviewees mentioned that global health was a field 349 that self-selected for individuals with altruistic values: \"I think that many people who choose to 350 do global health [have] ...stronger altruistic focus or willingness to devote their time.\" (Global 351 Health Physician #1, interview) Several participants mentioned that their values came from their 352 familial upbringing, religious background, or political ideology, and that pursuing careers in 353 global health was a way for them to put their values into practice.354 355 DISCUSSION 356 This exploratory study contributes to an expanded understanding of the ways in which 357 global health physicians and academic global health program leaders understand their work in 358 relationship to the field of global health, and the perceived impact of this work on the US 359 healthcare system. Our analysis revealed that those who engage in global health work are deeply 360 affected by experiences abroad, and in turn these experiences influence the way they practice 361 medicine back home-even in the face of what participants perceive to be a challenging 362 healthcare ecosystem. This was often described as a contradiction of values between the profit-Page 16 of 30 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open",

They describe global health work as personally rewarding, 377 a counterweight to personal frustrations resulting from the US healthcare system. Several 378 participants explicitly state that global health work is a return to their altruistic values, an 379 opportunity to \"save lives,\" or to serve regardless of cost. In contrast, they describe practicing in 380 the US as prioritizing pleasing the patients and the 'worried well' (as opposed to healing people, 381 and understanding the broader roots of affliction), practicing \"insurance medicine\" or \"liability 382 medicine\", or \"customer service\". They attribute these perceptions to either the volunteer nature 383 of their global health work, their experiences working in non-US healthcare systems, or 384 witnessing different provider-patient relationships while abroad.

The idea of escaping from the 389 confines of the bureaucratic US healthcare system into a LMIC medical setting can often propel390 well-intending physicians into potentially ethically problematic global health situations. They 391 may be operating outside of the laws of the 'host' country, and be unfamiliar with the structural 392 determinants of health in this new setting; and, as a result their work might undermine local 393 healthcare delivery systems. These are situations we have seen in our collective global health 394 work, and about which several participants spoke during interviews. 395 The most significant division amongst participants is whether they viewed their global 396 health work as a vehicle for change on individual care, and/or systemic changes in the US. Those 397 that did report positive benefits of global health for improved patient-care and the changes to the 398 US healthcare system overall discuss these more at the individual level-such as reduced 399 spending, better patient care, and replicating interventions that had proven effective abroad. 400 These findings are supported by similar research looking at the perspectives of short-term global 401 health residency electives[29], international clinical rotations[41], and other forms of global 402 health engagement[42]. Additionally, several participants point to the role of global health 403 physicians in preventing pandemics by being better prepared at recognizing new infectious 404 diseases, going to the source of the outbreak, and identifying the need for the US healthcare 405 system to take infectious disease threats more seriously. 406 A majority of participants reported having a better understanding of the weaknesses and 407 strengths of the US healthcare system as a result of their global health work.

This could be the result of a multitude of factors, such 422 as an increased awareness to the obstacles that stand in the way of reform, a recognition of the 423 immensity of reform required, or an understanding of the difficulty of bringing about positive 424 changes in the current political context.",

We also feel that future research seeking to understand the growing interest in 443 the global health field could investigate how perceived conflict of values between altruistically-444 driven physicians and the US healthcare system could act as a potential force in generating more 445 interest in global health, and how the US healthcare system or individual institutions could 446 decrease physician discontentment associated with a conflict of care values.",

The idea of escaping from the 392 confines of the bureaucratic US healthcare system into a LMIC medical setting can often propel 393 well-intending physicians into potentially ethically problematic global health situations. They 394 may be operating outside of the laws of the 'host' country, and be unfamiliar with the structural 395 determinants of health in this new setting; and, as a result their work might undermine local 396 healthcare delivery systems. These are situations we have seen in our collective global health 397 work, and about which several participants spoke during interviews. 398 The most significant division amongst participants is whether they viewed their global 399 health work as a vehicle for change on individual care, and/or systemic changes in the US. Those 400 that did report positive benefits of global health for improved patient-care and the changes to the 401 US healthcare system overall discuss these more at the individual level-such as reduced 402 spending, better patient care, and replicating interventions that had proven effective abroad. 403 These findings are supported by similar research looking at the perspectives of short-term global 404 health residency electives[29], international clinical rotations[41], and other forms of global 405 health engagement[42].

We also feel that future research seeking to understand the growing interest in 446 the global health field could investigate how perceived conflict of values between altruistically-447 driven physicians and the US healthcare system could act as a potential force in generating more 448 interest in global health, and how the US healthcare system or individual institutions could 449 decrease physician discontentment associated with a conflict of care values.",

I collect a paycheck and then go back[abroad].\" (GHP #3, interview)Several interview participants identified current and future potential challenges of infectious disease epidemics to the US healthcare system, and the perceived benefits of global health work in primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. One participant noted, \"If we are not prepared to fight that pandemic, like Ebola or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, in the place where it starts then that will eventually come to anybody anywhere in the world\" (PL #6, interview). Another participant discussed epidemics and the perceived benefits of global health304 work to infectious disease control: \"I see a lot of infections when I'm overseas that then periodically show up here and I think I'm one of the few people that could actually like deal with [it]. So, it informs the technical aspect of my job.\" (PL #6, interview) One of the primary research questions was whether a greater recognition of the strengths and weakness of the US healthcare system could lead to a culture of change amongst global health physicians in their US sites of practice. The participants responded in a variety of waysmost of which contained elements of doubt, cynicism, disinterest, or a perceived greater abilityto support impactful changes to foreign healthcare systems. Discussing their personal experiences with the US healthcare system, one participant noted: \"There are so many competing agendas, and it is the big money that is going to win out. I hate to sound cynical\" (PL #7, interview). Another participant explained that their work providing technical expertise to the Kenyan Health Ministry \"can make public health decisions that have a big impact much more easily than anybody here can have\" (PL #6, interview). Several participants discussed how they had previously been involved in US healthcare advocacy and reform work, but had either lost interest, were too busy with their global health work, or had felt that they were able to bring about more meaningful reforms in non-US healthcare systems:\"One of the things is I used to follow US medical care, a lot, but I can't keep up, just because I try to keep up with things going on overseas...I used to know a lot about thisValues behind interest in global healthAll interviewed participants reported that their values were not changed by their global health work, but rather their values drove them to pursue global health in the first place-or allowed them to \"find a niche in which to put their values, (Program Leadership, interview #2), as one participant noted. Furthermore, five interviewees mentioned that global health was a field that self-selected for individuals with altruistic values:\"I think that many people who choose to do global health [have] ...stronger altruistic focus or willingness to devote their time.\" (Global Health Physician #1, interview) Several participants mentioned that their values came from their familial upbringing, religious background, or political ideology, and that pursuing careers in global health was a way for them to put their values into practice. This exploratory study contributes to an expanded understanding of the ways in which global health physicians and global health program leaders understand their work in relationship to the field of global health and the US healthcare system. Study participant responses reflect a shared understanding of the ways in which the US healthcare system treats patients as 'paying customers'-a product of the US fee-for-service and for-profit healthcare model 32 -in comparison to the non-profit, universal, or single payer models of healthcare delivery experienced by global health physician participants while abroad. Participants said that the US healthcare system manifests in problematic physician-patient relationships, too much time devoted to bureaucratic requirements, excessive fear of litigation, frivolous spending, overly aggressive medical care, and a disconnect between care providers and the lived experiences of low-income and immigrant patients, all perspectives noted in other studies 31 33-35 .Participants report that their personal values motivate them to pursue global health careers, a notion supported by studies on career choice selection 36 and short-term global health residency electives 23 . They describe global health work as personally rewarding, a counterweight to personal frustrations resulting from the US healthcare system. Several participants explicitly state that global health work is a return to their altruistic values, an opportunity to \"save lives\", or to serve regardless of cost. In contrast, they describe practicing in the US as prioritizing pleasing the patients and the 'worried well' (as opposed to healing people, and understanding the For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open",

Additionally, several participants point to the role of global health physicians in preventing pandemics by being better prepared at recognizing new infectious diseases, going to the source of the outbreak, and identifying the need for the US healthcare system to take pandemic threats more seriously. A majority of participants reported having a better understanding of the weaknesses and strengths of the US healthcare system as a result of their global health work. Other studies argue that global health experiences can serve the needs of the healthcare system by increasing the number of physicians who go into a primary care field and practice medicine in resource poor Participants who consider the impact of global health work on US patient care point to US national policies and the social determinants of health as being more important for improving patient health.

These participants suggest the need for domestic and foreign collective reforms to bring about significant health improvements.Our study found that global health physicians and global health program leaders do not feel greater agency to bring about policy or systems-level changes to the US healthcare systembecause of their global health experiences. This could be the result of a multitude of factors, such as an increased awareness to the obstacles that stand in the way of reform, a recognition of the immensity of reform required, or an understanding of the difficulty of bringing about positive changes in the current political context. The homogeneity of the research team is a notable limitation of this study, with lead researchers all from North America and predominantly white men, thus affecting the formulation of the research questions, the data received, and the analysis conducted. We reached out to 159 individuals and programs, 30 opened the questionnaire link, and only 12 completed the questionnaire (7.5% response rate). The study's small sample size was most likely a result of physician and program leadership survey fatigue-which, the research team was told directly by several who declined to participate-limiting the generalizability of our findings.
