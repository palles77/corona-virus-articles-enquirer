In this study, LaCl 3 treatmentinduced multiple responses in Scutellaria baicalensis seedlings, including the rapid generation of jasmonic acid (JA), sequentially followed by the enhancement of baicalin production. Direct application of JA also promoted the synthesis of baicalin in the absence of LaCl 3 . LaCl 3 -induced baicalin synthesis was blocked by two different JA synthesis inhibitors.

LaCl 3 treatment resulted in a JA burst and an increase in baicalin production. La-induced JA generation occurred earlier than the activation of baicalin synthesis, which indicated that JA might be generated as a signal prior to La-induced baicalin synthesis. Direct application of JA also induced baicalin synthesis, suggesting exogenous JA alone can induce baicalin synthesis in S. baicalensis seedlings. This further indicated that JA is an intermediate signal to induce baicalin synthesis. The La-induced baicalin synthesis was blocked by JA synthesis inhibitors, which strongly suggested that JA was involved in the LaCl 3 signal transduction that induced baicalin synthesis, in other words, baicalin synthesis was induced at least partially via a JA signal transduction pathway. Although the JA synthesis was suppressed by SHAM in the presence of LaCl 3 , baicalin production was significantly higher than in the control, implying that JA was not the only signal molecule for inducing baicalin REEs are considered important exogenous elicitors and used to stimulate secondary metabolite systems in medicinal plants [14] . Thus far, however, very few studies have investigated the signal transduction pathways of REE-induced secondary metabolite synthesis. JA biosynthesis is a wellcharacterized reaction of plants subjected to exogenous elicitors. JA signaling was reported to be involved in elicitorinduced flavonol glycoside accumulation [17] . However, the biosynthetic pathways for secondary metabolite production are regulated by multiple signal elements, such as JA, salicylic acid, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide, and their signal pathways. Our results demonstrated that although JA acts as a component of a signaling system leading to La-induced baicalin synthesis, it was not the only signal molecule for inducing baicalin synthesis.",
