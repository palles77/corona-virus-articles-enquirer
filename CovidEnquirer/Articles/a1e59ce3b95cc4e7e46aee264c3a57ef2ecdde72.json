Two groups of five dogs were experimentally inoculated with 50 and 100 third stage infective larvae (L 3 ) of A. vasorum per kilogram of body weight. A third group of five uninfected animals were used as control. Serum from these animals were used for biochemical tests to measure total and fractioned proteins, urea, creatinine and to determine the activities of aspartate (AST), alanine (ALT) aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (PAL) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB). The a-1, a-2 and b-globulins fractions showed alterations during acute phase of the infection. No modifications were observed in the biochemical profiles of ALT, AST, GGT, PAL, urea and creatinine. CK-MB was shown to be a good early indicator of cardiac injury in dogs experimentally infected with A. vasorum. #",

Reports in the literature with respect to the profile of total proteins in infected dogs were not found. It is important to note that the profile of total proteins presents little diagnostic reliability in isolation without the use of other parameters. When it is analyzed with the electrophoretic running however, it is possible to know which fraction is altered. An analysis of the electrophoretic profile revealed an increase in both fractions a1 and a2globulins, mainly on the 100th d.i. and b-globulin between the 30th and the 45th d.i. The alterations found in the proteic fractions occurred in the clinical acute phase of the disease. According to Mebus and Coles (1965) , the increase of these globulins occurs in inflammatory processes, mainly related to a2-globuline, which is more sensitive in bacterial and viral infections. Dogs with angiostrongylosis may present pulmonary alterations due to the presence of the parasite in this organ which may provide secondary bacterial infection. The mechanism which promotes the increase of the concentration of this fraction is not yet clear. The alterations related to the b-globulin were previously mentioned by Groulade (1963) , Mishra and Cens (1971) and Patteson et al. (1993) . These probably occurred due to the severity of the pulmonary infection. Changes in the concentration of the proteic fraction are observed in enteropathies and in inflammatory processes. The number of larvae did not interfere in the response in terms of immunoglobulin concentration, as the animals of the inoculated groups showed similar responses to the infection. No significant ALT differences were observed between the average activities of the groups. Some days later however, groups A and B presented higher activity compared to the control group which may be related to minor hepatic injury induced by parasitic activity. Koch and Jensen (1992) have also found normal levels of ALT in naturally infected dogs. This enzyme is important in the evaluation of hepatic injury and it is a good marker of hepatocellular injury in the acute phase. No significant alterations in AST activity were observed. However, on the 45th d.i. AST activity was higher compared to the control group in both inoculated groups, although no statistical differences were observed. This enzyme, besides being present in the hepatocytes, is also present in muscular cardiac cells. The increase of its activity coincides with the presence of the parasite in the heart. This increase is related to the cardiac injury produced by the parasite and is therefore also associated with the increase of CK-MB activity.",

Increased levels were also observed between the 30th and the 45th d.i. which coincides with the arrival of the parasite in the heart and lung when it becomes an adult worm and this damage to the heart may be caused by mechanical and/or antigenic activity. These injuries are detected very early by determining the CK-MB activity. When this enzyme was associated to the analysis of AST for evaluating cardiac injury (Puleo and Guadagno, 1990) we observed a parallelism between these two measurements indicating that this is an active process. We have no explanation why CK-MB activity come down after 150 d.i.. The possible explanation are the reduction of adult worms in the heart considering that no reinfection has occurred, this fact may implicate in the reduction of cardiac damage by mechanical process and due to the reduction of cardiac damage it would occur a concomitant reduction of the enzyme activity.
