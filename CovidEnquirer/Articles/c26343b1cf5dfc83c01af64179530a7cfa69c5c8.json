Although the most commonly identifi ed viruses have been infl uenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (1), human rhinovirus (HRV) is being increasingly associated with severe respiratory disease and outbreaks in these facilities (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Clinical diagnosis of HRV by immunofl uorescence and virus culture has been diffi cult because these methods are unreliable (7, 8) . Moreover, because multiple serotypes of HRV exist, retrospective serologic testing cannot be used to evaluate the prevalence of HRV disease (5) . As a result, the number of outbreaks caused by HRV in long-term care facilities, and the associated illness and death, may be substantially underestimated. We therefore used 2009 surveillance data to estimate prevalence of HRV disease in long-term care facilities.",

The number and timing of specimens collected was left to the discretion of the attending physicians. The regional clinical laboratories cultured specimens (blood, urine, and sputum) for bacteria and performed rapid viral antigen testing for infl uenza A/B and RSV. To facilitate turnaround time during periods of higher demand, we used an alternate multiplex NAT kit (Seeplex RV; Seegene USA, Rockville, MD, USA) in conjunction with the Luminex assay. Because the Luminex assay cannot differentiate between ENT and HRV, we used the Seeplex RV kit, which can identify HRV, to confi rm results in a random subset of ENT/HRV-positive samples. To type the HRV implicated in outbreaks during which deaths occurred, we amplifi ed and sequenced the hypervariable region of the 5\u2032 noncoding region, the entire viral capsid protein (VP) 4 gene, and the 5\u2032 terminus of the VP2 gene; we then constructed phylogenetic trees as described (10, 11) .",

Although postmortem specimens were available for analysis from only 1 outbreak-related case, we identifi ed HRV in the postmortem lung specimen. Because we do not know whether HRV was present in the lower respiratory tract of the remaining patients who died, a causal association between HRV and severe disease must be made cautiously. We used the 2 NAT assays interchangeably because their reported specifi city is >96% for all targets (15) . Sensitivity for each assay differs according to target; compared with the Luminex assay, Seeplex RV is more sensitive for parainfl uenza, RSV, coronavirus, and adenovirus but less sensitive for HRV (15) . However, despite limitations for epidemiologic data collection, no pathogens other than HRV could explain these outbreaks and associated deaths. Our testing panel did not include human bocavirus or infl uenza C virus, which could be involved in the remaining 21% of outbreaks that had no identifi ed cause and could even represent confounding factors in the causal relationship of a supposed pathogen.",
