            "text": "Malectin is a carbohydrate-binding lectin protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It selectivity binds to Glc 2 -N-glycan and is involved in a glycoprotein quality control mechanism. Even though malectin may play a role in immunity, its role in innate immunity is not fully known. In the present study, we identified and characterized the malectin gene from Hippocampus abdominalis (HaMLEC). We analyzed sequence features, spatial expression levels, temporal expression profiles upon immune responses, bacterial and carbohydrate binding abilities and anti-viral properties to investigate the potential role of HaMLEC in innate immunity. The molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) were estimated to be 31.99 kDa and 5.17, respectively. The N-terminal signal peptide, malectin superfamily domain and C-terminal transmembrane region were identified from the amino acid sequence of HaMLEC. The close evolutionary relationship of HaMLEC with other teleosts was identified by phylogenetic analysis. According to quantitative PCR (qPCR) results, HaMLEC expression was observed in all the examined tissues and high expression was observed in the ovary and brain, compared to other tested tissues. Temporal expression of HaMLEC in liver and blood tissues were significant modulated upon exposure to immunogens Edwardasiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, polyinosinic:polycytidylic and lipopolysaccharide. The presence of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) of bacterial glycosyl hydrolases were functionally confirmed by a bacterial binding assay. Anti-viral activity significantly reduced viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) replication in cells overexpressing HaMLEC. The observed results suggested that HaMLEC may have a significant role in innate immunity in Hippocampus abdominalis.",

These behaviors and traits of seahorses reduce their environmental fitness and make them vulnerable to overfishing or habitat damage [16, 17] . They reside in temperate and tropical coastal waters. They are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, tonics and as decorative species in aquariums [17] . Several countries, including Australia, New Zealand and China, are involved in commercial seahorse aquaculture [18, 19] . However, seahorses are species that are included in the \"convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora\" [18] . Hippocampus abdominalis (H. abdominalis) can differentiate into other seahorses by deepening of the trunk, and formation of tail rings and dorsal fin rays [18] . Various seahorse diseases were identified by observations in aquaculture and laboratory studies [20] . Mortality caused by Philasterides dicentrarchi was identified in aquarium seahorses that was used in public exhibition [21] . Fungal infection in H. abdominalis and mycobacterial infection in Hippocampus reidi have been identified [22] . Lymphocystis caused by iridovirus infection was reported in Hippocampus comes [23] . Understanding the immune system and immune responses will provide insight into diminishing mortality and diseases in seahorse species. Therefore, molecular identification, characterization and functional studies of immune system components may present an efficient way to maintain successful seahorse aquaculture.",

Briefly, the ORF of HaMLEC was amplified by PCR using cDNA from ovarian tissue. During PCR amplification, restriction enzyme sites for BamHI and HindIII were added to the ORF by gene-specific primers HaMLEC-F3 and HaMLEC-R3 (Table 1) , respectively. A PCR mixture was prepared to a total volume of 50 \u03bcL with nuclease-free water and included: 5 \u03bcL of 10 \u00d7 ExTaq buffer, 4 \u03bcL of 2.5 mM dNTP, 10 pmol forward primer, 10 pmol reverse primer, 80 ng cDNA template and 5U ExTaq\u2122 DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan).

Significantly elevated malectin transcription was observed in ER-stress induced HEK293 cells by tunicamycin [10] . Recent studies indicate the potential role of malectin in immunity [11] [12] [13] . However, information about malectin in innate immunity is limited and no previous studies on teleost malectin have been reported. In this study, we characterized the malectin gene from H. abdominalis. Tissue-specificity and temporal expression of HaMLEC were analyzed, and functional assays were performed to predict its potential role in innate immunity. Previous studies revealed that malectin localizes to the ER membrane [9] . Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER induces the highest expression of malectin. Malectin and ribophorin-I form complex structures for selective retention of misfolded glycoproteins during ER quality control (ERQC) and transports them to the cytoplasm for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Once malectin becomes highly expressed relative to ribophorin I expression under ER stress, the proportion of free malectin will increase and bind to G2M9 of glycoproteins. To reduce ER stress, the free malectin glycoprotein complex transports to the Golgi [39] .",

Highest malectin expression was recorded in mature ovarian follicles in Danio rerio [40] . Ubiquitous distribution of malectin was observed in adult Xenopus laevis and has been implicated in embryonic development, preventing late organogenesis by inducing apoptosis or necrosis by inhibiting proliferation of malectin-expressing tissue [41] . The role of malectin in embryogenesis may explain why HaMLEC expression is highest in the ovaries. Gills are always exposed to the external environment and are more susceptible to pathogenic infection. In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), increased immune gene expression was observed during Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infection [42] . Disease outbreak in a turbot farm after Chryseobacterium scophthalmum infection was reported in Scotland by Mudarris and Austin, where they recovered dense bacterial cultures from the gills, brain and other organs [43] . Viral infection was also recorded in the brain of fish [44] . Moreover, recent studies on gilthead seabream and European sea bass proved that nervous necrosis virus (NNV) colonizes and produces infectious particles in male testis [45] .

The majority of plasma glycoproteins are synthesized in the liver [46] . Parenchymal hepatocytes occupy 70-85% of the liver, which actively synthesize large amounts of protein, including important innate immune proteins that are released into the blood [47] . Blood from the gut passes through the liver before it reaches the heart [48] , therefore, foreign material exposure is greater in the liver. Certain types of white blood cells are a part of the immune system. Moreover, this consists of chemicals and proteins, such as interferon, complement proteins and antibodies. Some of these components can act against foreign substances directly, and the remaining help immune cells [49] . Significant increase in HaMLEC expression following exposure to all four stimulants implied that HaMLEC is involved in the immune system. However, information regarding the mechanism of the role of malectin in immune responses is insufficient. HaMLEC up-regulation in response to poly I:C in blood was significantly higher compared to the other stimulants, suggesting that HaMLEC might play an important role during viral infection. Significant changes in HaMLEC expression in blood and liver tissue following immune stimulation further indicates that HaMLEC might play an important role in innate immunity in H. abdominalis.",

A possible role of malectin in glycoprotein quality control was suggested when a complex formed by malectin with ribophorin I was identified [69] . In addition, the association of malectin with newly synthesized misfolded influenza virus HA conformers also has been recorded [66] .",

VHSV causes viral haemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) disease in more than 70 species worldwide, including freshwater and marine fish [70] . Since 2001, VHS has affected aquaculture of olive flounder in Korea and caused substantial economic loss [71] . More than 90 marine and freshwater fish species in the world are affected by severe disease and mortality caused by VHSV [72, 73] . VHSV is a negative-sense singlestranded RNA virus, which belongs to genus Novirhabdovirus and family Rhabdoviridae. VHSV has an 11 kb negative-sense RNA genome of linear single-stranded, consisting of 6 genes in the order 3\u2032-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5\u2032 encoding five structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), RNA polymerase (L) and a nonstructural protein (NV) [74] [75] [76] . Significant down-regulation of expression was observed for these 6 viral genes in FHM cells overexpressing HaMLEC, further validating that HaMLEC may have a significant role in viral replication in H. abdominalis.",

Bacterial binding and agglutination ability of HaMLEC confirmed the presence of CBM-like structures. Antiviral properties of HaMLEC were confirmed with VHSV.
