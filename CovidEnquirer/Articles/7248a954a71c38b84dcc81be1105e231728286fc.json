The aim of the present retrospective study was to develop a mortality prediction model for TDL patients who require mechanical ventilation. Methods: Data from consecutive TDL patients who had received mechanical ventilation at a single university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Korea were reviewed. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. A TDL on mechanical Ventilation (TDL-Vent) score was calculated by assigning points to variables according to \u03b2 coefficient values. Results: Data from 125 patients were reviewed. A total of 36 patients (29%) died during ICU admission. On the basis of multivariate analysis, the following factors were included in the TDL-Vent score: age \u226565 years, vasopressor use, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <180. In a second regression model, a modified score was then calculated by adding brain natriuretic peptide. For TDL-Vent scores 0 to 3, the 60-day mortality rates were 11%, 27%, 30%, and 77%, respectively (p<0.001). For modified TDL-Vent scores 0 to \u22653, the 60-day mortality rates were 0%, 21%, 33%, and 57%, respectively (p=0.001). For both the TDL-Vent score and the modified TDL-Vent score, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were larger than that of other illness severity scores.",

Ryu et al. 4 evaluated 169 patients with TDL and found that extensive lung destruction was the only independent predictor of reduced survival, although only 50 patients (30%) in the cohort had required mechanical ventilation. Acute respiratory failure secondary to TDL is associated with high rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, which may burden the limited resources of developing countries 5, 6 .

Active infection was defined as the presence in a blood culture or adequate sputum culture, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoscopy sample of a pneumonia pathogen (bacteria, including tuberculosis; a virus; or a fungus). To evaluate the extent of disease involvement, baseline chest X-rays were graded on a 4-point scale (field score 1-4) using a radiographic scoring method described elsewhere 4, 9, 10 . First, four zones were demarcated by dividing each lung into two equal-sized zones (upper and lower) on a frontal radiograph. In each of the four zones, the following scoring system was then applied: (1) 0, no abnormality; (2) 1, when less than 25% of lung parenchyma showed destructive lung lesions; and (3) 2, 3, or 4, respectively, when destroyed lung lesions involved 25%-50%, 50%-75%, or >75% of lung parenchyma. The field score was then calculated as the mean disease involvement of the two lungs. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) were expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal values. The FVC and FEV 1 values were calculated using Korean equations, which were based on data from a non-smoking population with normal chest radiograph findings and no history of lung disease or symptoms. In these equations, the predicted value is adjusted in accordance with age, sex, height, and weight 11 . Cor pulmonale was diagnosed on the basis of both clinical and echocardiographic findings 12 . Echocardiographic signs of cor pulmonale comprised right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy or dilation accompanying high RV systolic pressure (> 35 mm Hg) 12,13 .",

No significant difference was found between survivors and nonsurvivors in terms of sex, body mass index, smoking status, or comorbidities. Mechanical ventilation was primarily due to pneumonia in 54% (48/89) of survivors and 69% (25/36) of non-survivors (p=0.11). Nonsurvivors had significantly higher APACHE II and SOFA scores and had a higher rate of vasopressor use within 24 hours of ICU admission. Active infection was found in 44 (35%) of the cohort, with no significant difference being found between survivors and non-survivors. The following pathogens were considered to be associated with pneumonia: methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=14); Acinetobacter (n=9); Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n=6); Pseudomonas (n=5); extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organism (n=4); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3); Stenotrophomonas (n=3); and Aspergillus species (n=3). The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio was significantly lower in non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors had numerically lower serum albumin and higher BNP, although the results were not statistically significant. Survivors and non-survivors had similar median field scores. Pulmonary function test results were available for 54 (43%) of the cohort. The median FEV 1 /FVC ratio was <0.70, and no significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors were found for median FVC and FEV 1 . Echocardiographic findings were available for 64 (51%) of the cohort. Cor pulmonale was diagnosed in nearly half of the patients. However, the survivor and non-survivor groups showed no difference in terms of left ventricular systolic function or the proportion of patients with high RV systolic pressure. Clinical outcomes in the cohort are shown in Table 2 . Table 3 shows the results of the univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors predicting ICU mortality. The following cut-off values were identified via inspection of locally weighted scatterplot smoothing curves: age \u226565 years, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <180, PaCO 2 <52 mm Hg, serum albumin <3.0 g/dL, BNP \u2265330 pg/mL, and field score \u22652 (Supplementary Figure S1) . Based on the \u03b2 coefficient values observed in model 1, a TDL-Vent score comprising the following factors was proposed: (1) age \u226565 years (+1 point); (2) vasopressor use (+1 point); and (3) PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <180 (+1 point). This model had acceptable discrimination (AUC, 0.74) and calibration (Hosmer and Lemeshow chi-square, 14.74; p=0.06). Figure 1A shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, as stratified according to the TDL-Vent score. The 60-day mortality rates for scores ranging from 0 to 3 were 11%, 27%, 30%, and 77%, respectively (logrank test, p<0.001). The AUC of the TDL-Vent score for predicting ICU mortality was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.80). This was larger than the AUC for the APACHE II score (0.63; 95% CI, 0.54-0.72) and SOFA score (0.62; 95% CI, 0.53-0.71) (Figure 2 ). The cut-off score for predicting mortality based on the maximum Youden' s index was \u22652, with a sensitivity of 44% and a specificity of 93%.",

The main strength of the present study was its relatively large cohort, which was restricted to patients requiring mechanical ventilation. This enabled the development of an individualized mortality prediction score for this specific population. An interesting and unexpected finding of the present study was the lack of association between the degree of lung destruction, tuberculosis activity, or the level of PaCO 2 and increased mortality. Instead, the prognostic factors in the present cohort were age and evidence of organ failure (vasopressor use and PaO 2 /FiO 2 <180), as suggested in other patient populations. These risk factors are consistent with those reported in previous studies of active pulmonary tuberculosis with acute respiratory failure 3,20,21 , thus supporting the hypothesis that lower physiologic reserve and organ dysfunction, rather than the destroyed lung per se, are better predictors of mortality in mechanically ventilated TDL patients. A low serum albumin level also correlated with mortality in active pulmonary tuberculosis with acute respiratory failure 23 . In this study, nonsurvivors had lower levels of serum albumin than survivors, although this trend did not reach statistical significance. In the present cohort, the TDL-Vent score (both model 1 and model 2) was superior in terms of discriminating between survivors and non-survivors than either the APACHE II score or the SOFA score. In addition, the score from model 1 showed very high specificity in patients with the highest risk of mortality, thus limiting the possibility of misclassifying a patient as very high risk. This is crucial, as such a classification may result in the decision to withhold or withdraw life support. Lastly, the clinician is able to calculate the TDL-Vent score at the bedside, rather than relying on complicated formulas, smear tests, or chest X-rays.",

These findings are consistent with the results of previous studies 19, 25, 26 , which demonstrated that BNP levels were a prognostic factor in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic cor pulmonale.

            "text": "The present study had several limitations. First, the study was retrospective and conducted at a single center. Although the study enrolled more mechanically ventilated TDL cases than previous studies, the sample size was relatively small and likely to have been responsible for some of the insignificant results. Moreover, the relatively long study period (>10 years) may have introduced selection and information bias. Second, in attempting to identify risk factors for mortality, high specificity was obtained at the expense of lower sensitivity, as a substantial proportion of patients who died did not have a high TDL-Vent score. Third, a substantial number of patients were excluded from the echocardiography and pulmonary function analyses due to missing data. The inclusion of these patients might have influenced the study results. Lastly, the present study provided a development set only, and the results therefore require independent validation.",

The \u03b2 coefficient values derived from multiple logistic regression were simplified to natural numbers >0, and the TDL-Vent score was calculated as the sum of these simplified values. To predict 60day survival, Kaplan-Meier estimates were stratified according to the TDL-Vent score, and curves were compared using the log-rank test. The AUC for the TDL-Vent score predicting ICU mortality was compared with that for the APACHE II score and the SOFA score. Identification of an optimal cut-off value for the score was based on the maximum Youden' s index15 . All tests of significance were two-tailed, and p-values of <0.05 were considered significant.
