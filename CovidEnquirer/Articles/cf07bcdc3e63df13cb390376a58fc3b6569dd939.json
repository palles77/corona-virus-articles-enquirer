The dissemination of infectious agents with the purpose of attacking livestock and agricultural resources has similar motives. Many of the agents that could potentially be used in bioterror (BT) attacks are also responsible for naturally occurring infectious diseases in the tropics. As such, naturally occurring outbreaks must be differentiated from BT attacks for public health, forensic, and security reasons. If a BT attack occurs in tropical underdeveloped countries, owing to their weak public health infrastructure, the public health implications would be even more dramatic than in developed countries. An outbreak of smallpox due to a BT attack would probably require vaccination and mandatory quarantine of millions of people in order to control the outbreak and quell global public unrest. This chapter will concentrate on selected infectious agents that have the potential to be used as bioterror agents in human populations.",

            "text": "The first step in managing the damage from a covert biological dissemination is recognition of the attack and the organism(s). As in most emerging infections, we predict that in bioterrorist attacks the etiological diagnosis will be made by a clinician or pathologist and the recognition of a bioterrorist event will be through geographical and epidemiological anomalies. We have very limited environmental detection capability at this time, and there are no comprehensive pointof-care diagnostics for most of the high-impact BT agents. Some diseases such as inhalational anthrax or smallpox may be relatively readily recognized by an alert clinician because of their very distinctive presentation in many cases. However, the leading edge of a BT epidemic may arrive on a pathologist' s doorstep without prior suspicion. For example, individual cases of pneumonic plague as the earliest harbingers of an attack will presumably present as community-acquired pneumonia and probably die without clinical diagnosis. Given the short window available for successful treatment, the recognition of these earliest cases is paramount. Sartwell 1 has demonstrated empirically that incubation periods follow a log-normal distribution, which results in \"front-loading\" of cases ( Fig. 119-1 ). Delay in recognizing the epidemic through reliance on syndromic surveillance or other surrogates will likely result in most of the cases of diseases such as plague and tularemia being well into their disease course and perhaps unsalvageable. 2 Bioterrorist events will enlarge our knowledge of tropical diseases. For example, inhalational anthrax and several viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) thought to be transmitted mainly by aerosol 3 are under-represented in naturally occurring case series, and a BT attack would provide an opportunity to answer questions about the underlying host factors and pathogenesis. Indeed, the extension of the risk population to include children, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed is likely to provide considerable insight into these oftenunderstudied groups. It is also likely that our lack of information about them will challenge our current diagnostic algorithms.",

Ever since the times of the ancient Greeks and Romans, humans have tried to inflict damage by the use of contagion on other populations. 6, 7 Less than 4% of the people or groups responsible for terrorist attacks on human populations take responsibility for their actions. 8 Therefore, the use of biological weapons is ideal to conduct covert attacks. In addition, it has been estimated that to kill the same number of human beings with biological weapons as compared to chemical or nuclear weapons, the cost is far less with biological weapons ($2/human casualty) compared with chemical ($2000/ human casualty) and nuclear ($2,000,000/human casualty) weapons. 6 Hypothetical BT attacks would range from an overt attack of a large city with a bomb containing several kilograms of an agent (weaponized bacteria, viruses, or toxins) to discrete or covert intentional release of the infectious agent through a delivery system, such as spray devices, postal service, ventilation ducts, water supplies, and food supply.",

            "text": "Based on transmissibility, severity of morbidity and mortality, and likelihood of use (availability, stability, weaponization), potential BT agents are divided into three categories (Table 119-1) . This chapter will concentrate on selected agents from categories A and B and on the diagnostic challenges posed by illnesses caused by such agents. Table 119 -1 are capable of producing illness under natural circumstances. Therefore, the first challenge is to identify the infectious agent responsible for a certain disease correctly, followed by a thorough epidemiologic and microbiologic analysis of the epidemic or outbreak. In some circumstances, the identification of a BT attack would be obvious. A case of smallpox in any human population is an international emergency that would trigger a massive response of the public health systems around the world. Sophisticated epidemiological investigations would follow in order to characterize the outbreak, identify the source, and possibly label it \"intentional.\" In other cases, the identification of the outbreak as secondary to intentional dissemination of an infectious agent will require the use of sophisticated epidemiological and molecular tools, especially for diseases endemic to the area where the outbreak occurs. The need to use genetic sequences as markers has spawned a new discipline referred to as microbial forensics, sister to phylogenetics and \"molecular epidemiology.\" Differentiation between natural infections and a biological warfare attack rests firstly on disease patterns given by several epidemiological clues. They include presence of disease outbreaks of the same illness in noncontiguous areas, disease outbreaks with zoonotic impact, different attack rates in different environments (indoor versus outdoor), presence of large epidemics in small populations, increased number of unexplained deaths, unusually high severity of a disease for a particular pathogen, unusual clinical manifestations owing to route of transmission for a given pathogen, presence of a disease (vector-borne or not) in an area not endemic for that particular disease, multiple epidemics with different diseases in the same population, a case of a disease by an uncommon agent (smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers, inhalational anthrax), unusual strains of microorganisms when compared to conventional strains circulating in the same affected areas, and genetically homogenous organisms isolated from different locations. 9, 10 These are a few guidelines that could prove helpful when investigating an outbreak, but it has to be kept in mind that the deduction will not be based on any single finding but rather the pattern seen in its totality. First and foremost, the possibility of an attack must be ever in mind, or differentiation of a covert BT attack and a natural outbreak of an infectious disease may not be made. In fact, the outbreak of salmonellosis in Oregon in 1984 was due to a covert attack planned by the Rajneeshee leadership and accompanied by distinctive epidemiological clues. It was not labeled as intentional until somebody came forward with the information leading to the responsible group; as in most of medicine, the unsuspected diagnosis is the easiest to miss. 11 An increasing number of public health departments are now acquiring the technology necessary to perform syndromic surveillance. This new method of surveillance is based on syndromic disease rates such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological syndromes or analysis of other health-related activities such as laboratory test requests and results, purchasing rates for certain pharmaceutical agents, unexplained death rates, and veterinary surveillance. 2, 10, 11 The purpose of syndromic surveillance is to detect a BT attack as early as possible by analyzing the previously mentioned variables by extracting and analyzing data through computer networks. The rationale behind syndromic surveillance is the nonspecific nature of early signs and symptoms of many of the illnesses caused by BT agents. Examples of proposed syndromes are as follows: gastroenteritis of any apparent infectious etiology, pneumonia with the sudden death of a previously healthy adult, widened mediastinum in a febrile patient, acute neurologic illness with fever, and advancing cranial nerve impairment with weakness. 12 A key component Factors affecting syndromic surveillance include selection of data sources, definition of syndrome categories, selection of statistical detection thresholds, availability of resources for follow-up, recent experiences with false alarms, and criteria for initiating investigations. It must be emphasized that these systems are experimental and not yet of proven value in managing BT attacks. They are expensive, require follow-up confirmation, have unproven sensitivity and specificity, and ultimately depend on the clinician. 2 They may prove to be more useful in managing an event than in expeditiously detecting one.",

Other variables are included in the analysis, such as time and place, and an epidemiological curve can be constructed. 10 Epidemiological curves are an important tool to analyze epidemics and suggest the mode of transmission and propagation. A point source epidemic curve is classically log-normal in distribution 1 and would suggest a common exposure of a population to an infectious agent. Of course, there can be variations depending on the presence of susceptible subpopulations (e.g., children, immunosuppressed, aged) and on varying doses of the agent.

In the event of a bioterror attack, either overt or covert, the clinical presentation of the patients affected by the attack would be that of inhalational anthrax. This form of anthrax is so rare that a single case of inhalational anthrax should raise immediate suspicion, as dramatically demonstrated during the BT attacks in the fall of 2001. [13] [14] [15] During those attacks, 50% of cases were cutaneous anthrax thought to be secondary to handling of anthraxlaced mail envelopes or environmental surface contamination in the presence of minor cutaneous lesions, providing a portal of entry for the spores. 5 An outbreak of inhalational anthrax also took place in Sverdlovsk (former Soviet Union) as a result of an accidental release into the air of B. anthracis spores from a facility producing anthrax for the bioweapons program in the USSR. 5, [16] [17] [18] Inhalational anthrax should be suspected clinically in any individual presenting with fever and a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph (due to hemorrhagic mediastinitis). 19, 20 The incubation period is normally 3 to 5 days, but in some cases it can be as short as 2 days and as long as 60 days depending on inoculum and the time of germination of the spore. 17 Based on research performed on rhesus monkeys, the LD 50 is estimated to be 8000 to 10,000 spores. [21] [22] [23] However, as few as 1 to 3 spores may be capable of producing a fatal outcome in approximately 1% of those exposed to these quantities. 24 The initial symptoms are nonspecific and consist of fever, malaise, anorexia, fatigue, and dry cough. These symptoms are followed in 3 to 4 days by an abrupt onset of respiratory insufficiency, stridor, diaphoresis, and cyanosis. The subsequent clinical course is rapid, and patients usually die within 24 to 36 hours after clinical deterioration. Mortality is 100% without antibiotic therapy. 20, [25] [26] [27] Early diagnosis, aggressive treatment with antimicrobial agents to which the bacteria are susceptible, and aggressive supportive therapy decreased the mortality to 40% in the 2001 attacks. 5 Pathologic studies performed on the Sverdlovsk victims confirmed some of the findings in animal models of inhalational anthrax, such as hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis. However, many patients also developed hematogenous hemorrhagic pneumonia. Pleural effusions were usually large and frequently led to severe lung atelectasis. In about half of cases, hemorrhagic meningitis developed, leading rapidly to central nervous system (CNS) manifestations terminating in coma and death. 16, 28, 29 Yersinia pestis (Plague) Y. pestis (see Chapter 42) is a gram-negative, aerobic, nonsporulating coccobacillus, member of the Enterobacteriaceae with a wide host range, including rodents, felines, and humans. 30 The most important reservoirs are urban rats, and its main vector is the rat flea. In rural epizootics, reservoirs include prairie dogs and squirrels in the United States. 31 Y. pestis has been responsible for some of the most devastating pandemics in human history in the preantibiotic era (6th, 14th, and 19th centuries). 32 Public health measures have made this disease a rarity in the United States (around 20 cases/year) and around the world, although approximately 1000 cases are reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) every year (countries reporting plague include Madagascar, Tanzania, and Peru, among others).",

The pneumonic form is the most likely presentation in a case of plague due to a BT attack. It is worth mentioning that plague has already been used as a BT agent when Japan dropped thousands of Y. pestis-infected fleas over China leading to small outbreaks of bubonic plague in continental China during World War II. 33, 34 The incubation period for pneumonic plague is short, ranging from 2 to 3 days. It is the rarest form in natural infections (1% or less) but has the highest mortality, reaching 100% in untreated patients. The initial presentation is nonspecific and consists of cough, fever, and dyspnea. Cough may be productive (bloody, purulent, or watery in the initial phases). This is followed by a rapid clinical course leading to respiratory failure and the patient' s demise if not treated with antibiotics early in the course of the disease. 30, 31, 35 The factors that led to the severe Manchurian pneumonic plague outbreaks in the early 20th century are unknown, but weather, hygiene, and crowding were important factors. More recent outbreaks worldwide and particularly in the United States have been much smaller and readily controlled. Pneumonic cases are common in the United States, but secondary transmission has been rare in the last 50 years. Modeling of pneumonic transmission using eight small outbreaks to derive the parameters find average of secondary cases per primary case (Ro) to be approximately 1.3 prior to any control measures. 36 ",

In Europe, tularemia was first described in 1532; in the United States, it was first described in 1911 in California in the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake. 38 In natural infections, the most common source of infection is a tick bite and manipulation of infected animals such as wild rabbits. Six different clinical syndromes have been described as follows: ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, pharyngeal, pneumonic, and typhoidal. Marked overlap exists among all these forms, and for practical purposes two syndromes (ulceroglandular and typhoidal) have been proposed. [39] [40] [41] As a BT agent, F. tularensis will most likely cause a disease with a primary pulmonary component with secondary dissemination (typhoidal/systemic). In natural infections, both ulceroglandular and typhoidal forms can have a hematogenous pulmonary component, although it is more common in typhoidal forms. Pulmonary features include cough, pleural effusions, and multifocal bronchopneumonic infiltrates. If not treated promptly, patients usually develop adult respiratory distress syndrome leading to respiratory insufficiency and the patient' s demise. Case-fatality rate approaches 30% if not treated with appropriate antibiotics. 41",

            "text": "Smallpox eradication remains the single most important victory in the war against infectious diseases. Smallpox (see Chapter 58) is the only disease so far eradicated from the face of the earth due to human intervention. The WHO declared smallpox eradicated in 1980 after the last case of natural disease was diagnosed in Somalia in 1977, 42 and vaccination ceased around the world, rendering humankind vulnerable to reintroduction of the virus. [43] [44] [45] A laboratory accident was responsible for two more cases in 1978 in England. This accident prompted the WHO to restrict the frozen virus to two places in the world: the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Institute for Polyomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides in Moscow, later moved to NPO VECTOR, Novosibirisk, Russia. However, it is suspected that secret military repositories exist after the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and the subsequent exodus of scientists involved in its bioweapons program (Biopreparat). 46, 47 The agent responsible for this disease is an orthopox virus with no known animal reservoir, but high aerosol infectivity, stability, and mortality. Although not a category A agent, monkeypox is responsible for outbreaks in Africa and is the only other member of the orthopox genus capable of producing systemic disease in humans. The clinical disease is potentially indistinguishable from smallpox, where mortality rates in tropical Africa are around 10% to 15%. In May and June 2003, an outbreak of monkeypox occurred in the United States. 48 Thirty-seven infections were laboratory-documented and involved humans exposed to infected prairie dogs that had become infected because of contact with infected Gambian rats and dormice, two animal species shipped from Africa earlier that year. Infected humans included veterinarians, exotic pet dealers, and pet owners. The clinical spectrum in this outbreak ranged from asymptomatic seroconversions to febrile illness with papulovesicular rash. No deaths were associated with this outbreak. However, phylogenetic analysis of the virus placed it in the West Africa clade as opposed to the Central Africa clade which carries the previously mentioned case-fatality rate of 10% to 15%.",

In 1972, Yugoslavia underwent an epidemic with a total of 175 cases (35 deaths) and a vaccination program that included 20 million people in order to contain the outbreak and obtain international confidence. Vaccination with the vaccinia virus (a related orthopox virus) is the most effective way to prevent the disease and can be administered up to 4 days after contact with ill patients. Strict quarantine with respiratory isolation for 17 days is also mandatory. The newer generation of antivirals that have been developed after the disease was eradicated has never been tested in human populations, but in vitro data and experiments in animal models of poxvirus disease suggest some antiviral activity for the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates such as cidofovir. 49 The only vaccine available in the United States is Dryvax, and sufficient doses have been manufactured to cover the entire U.S. population. However, newer vaccines that may have fewer side effects are being developed.",

The initial phase is nonspecific, common to other viral syndromes, and is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, malaise, and headaches. During this prodromal phase in 10% of patients with fair complexion, a discrete erythematous rash appears on the face, forearms, and hands. The typical smallpox rash has a centrifugal distribution (that is, more abundant on the face and extremities than on the trunk and abdomen). An enanthem also develops with presence of oral ulcerations by the time the exanthem appears. Systemic manisfestations begin to subside once the rash appears and can reappear with superinfection of skin lesions or superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. Progression of the lesions is synchronous (maculopapules, vesicles, pustules). After pustules rupture, scabs form and detach in 2 to 3 weeks, leaving depigmented, scarred areas. This form of the disease, called variola major, is fatal in up to 30% of unvaccinated patients and 3% of vaccinated individuals. Various hemorrhagic forms exist. In some cases, the rash progresses very slowly and hemorrhage develops into the base of the lesions, which remain flat and soft instead of tense, carrying a bad prognosis. In some other cases, the disease is hemorrhagic from the beginning, leading to death 5 to 7 days after the initial symptoms appear (case-fatality rate: 100%). Finally, in some cases, a severe and overwhelming illness is followed by dusky skin lesions; these patients have a large quantity of virus and are extremely dangerous epidemiologically. Previously vaccinated individuals usually develop a milder disease that consists of a mild pre-eruptive phase followed by few skin lesions that appear more superficial, evolve more rapidly, and are not as synchronous as the classical type. 50 ",

Large outbreaks of the disease still occur in tropical regions around the world in areas stricken by war, famine, and poverty. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), on the other hand, is transmitted by tick bites and occurs endemically in South and Central America as well as North America. Rickettsiae target the microvascular endothelium leading to leaky capillaries systemically. 67 The main causes of morbidity and mortality are noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and cerebral edema leading to diffuse alveolar damage and meningoencephalitis. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific and include fever, malaise, headache, myalgias/arthralgias, cough, nausea, vomiting, confusion, stupor, and coma in severe cases. Skin rash ranges from maculopapular to petechial, depending on the severity, and is observed in around 90% of patients with RMSF and 2% to 100% of cases of epidemic typhus, depending on the darkness of cutaneous pigmentation. Rickettsiae are remarkably underestimated biothreats as they are highly infectious by low-dose aerosol exposure, possess a stable extracellular form, and are resistant to most empirically administered antibiotics, including \u03b2-lactams, aminoglycosides, and macrolides, and are exacerbated by sulfonamides. Case-fatality rates can be as high as 40% to 50% without antibiotic therapy and 3% to 5% with adequate antibiotic coverage. Lethal cases are usually due to delayed diagnosis. 64, 65, 68 These rickettsiae are highly infectious by aerosol and are potent BT agents. They are often discounted because of their susceptibility to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. However, the severity of the illness, the exhaustion of antibiotics in the face of a mass attack, and the existence of antibiotic-resistant organisms suggest they are still formidable players.",

[69] [70] [71] [72] The distribution of Q fever is worldwide and results from exposure to animals such as sheep, cattle, goats, cats, rabbits, and others. C. burnetii has spore-like characteristics that can withstand harsh environmental conditions and be transported by wind to other places. In natural infections, 60% of cases are asymptomatic and are diagnosed by seroconversion. In symptomatic cases, the presentation is nonspecific and includes malaise, fever, myalgias, cough, chills, headaches, anorexia, weight loss, and in some cases pleuritic chest pain. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are sometimes observed, although not frequently. Transmission occurs by exposure to infected animal products (meat, milk). Less common routes of infection are inhalational and cutaneous. The clinical presentation of brucellosis is highly variable, even after inhalational exposure. The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic seroconversion to severe acute systemic disease. Intermediate forms include undulant fever or chronic disease, characterized by presence of Brucella in virtually any organ. Acute systemic disease is highly incapacitating with high fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, chills, severe sweating, and, in very severe cases, delirium, coma, and death. Undulant fever is characterized by relapses of fever, weakness, generalized aching, and headache. Chronic infections may have manifestations related to several organ systems such as the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, CNS, joints, and bones. [73] [74] [75] ",

Shigella is a highly infectious organism that requires very low numbers (10 2 -10 3 organisms) to provoke clinical disease. The illness caused by Shigella and enterohemorrhagic E. coli is explosive and starts with fever, vomiting, severe abdominal cramping, bloody diarrhea, and systemic manifestations such as hypotension, and circulatory collapse if not treated rapidly. Both microorganisms produce an exotoxin responsible for most of the systemic manifestations associated. A distinct complication, hemolytic uremic syndrome, occurs in a small percentage of cases, being more common in children younger than 10 years of age, leading to renal failure and hemolysis. Salmonella is less infectious and less explosive than Shigella, and leads to fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and in some cases to typhoidal manifestations. Imported cases of V. cholerae have been diagnosed in the United States in the past. However, the disease occurs in southern Asia and Latin America as large outbreaks. The clinical illness is characterized by explosive watery diarrhea that leads to rapid dehydration and circulatory collapse.",

However, the use of the toxin in small BT attacks is possible in the tropics because of its ready availability and relatively easy extraction from the beans. Clinical presentation depends on the route of administration as does the LD 50 . In cases where large amounts of the toxin are ingested, the manifestations include nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal cramping, rectal hemorrhage, and diarrhea. As the clinical course progresses, anuria, mydriasis, severe headaches, and shock supervene leading to the patient' s demise in 2 to 3 days. Clinical manifestations usually appear within 10 hours after ingestion of the toxin. Inhalational exposure leads to prominent pulmonary manifestations 8 to 28 hours after exposure and fever, dyspnea, progressive cough, cyanosis, and death. Histologically, there is widespread necrosis of pulmonary parenchyma and pulmonary edema. A single case of parenteral intoxication was documented.

In such situations, animals could be seen as either direct victims of the attack or as sentinel events in a human outbreak. There are currently efforts to establish a network of laboratories dedicated to diagnosis of veterinary agents. 85",

In cases of inhalational anthrax, samples of sputum, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may yield growth of the agent. Demonstration of B. anthracis from nasal swabs has more epidemiological and prophylactic implications than clinical importance. Standard diagnostic techniques are based on visualization and isolation in the clinical microbiology laboratory and serological demonstration of antibodies against B. anthracis. [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] Visualization of B. anthracis from clinical specimens (blood cultures, CSF, and cutaneous lesions) by Gram stains is not difficult. B. anthracis appears as large gram-positive, spore-forming rods with a bamboo appearance. Isolation is achieved by inoculating standard sheep blood agar plates, and colonies appear as small, gray-white, nonhemolytic colonies. A selective medium (polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate agar) is available mostly for environmental samples and inhibits the growth of other Bacillus spp., such as B. cereus. Growth is rapid (24-48 hours) . 93 Confirmatory tests include \u03b3-phage lysis, detection of specific cell wall and capsular antigens, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA followed by sequencing. 90 Serological tests available for clinical diagnosis are based on detection of antibodies directed against protective antigen (PA). Cross-reactive antibodies decrease the specificity of this test. Assays based on toxin detection are available in specialized centers and are based on capture of anthrax toxins by using antibodies. Antibody-coated immunomagnetic beads are then analyzed by electrochemiluminescence technology. The analytical sensitivity of this technique for detection of anthrax toxin is at the picogram to femtogram level (10 \u221212 to 10 \u221215 ). 97, 98 Immunoliposomal technology combined with real-time PCR (for a DNA reporter sequence) is also in the early stages of development for several toxins (ricin, cholera, and botulinum) and appears promising with analytical sensitivity in the attomolar to zeptomolar (10 \u221218 to 10 \u221221 ) range for cholera toxin. 99 The specificity of this assay is given by the toxin-capturing antibody.",

The organisms are identified preliminarily by direct immunofluorescent assay with Y. pestisspecific antibodies, with final identification based on biochemical profiles in clinical microbiology laboratories. 110 Molecular diagnostic techniques based on real-time PCR have become available in recent years and involve detection of Y. pestis genes such as plasminogen activator (pla), genes coding for the Yop proteins and the capsular F1 antigen, and the 23S rRNA gene, which allows distinction from other Yersinia spp. [111] [112] [113] Assays have been developed to detect resistance to particular antibiotics. The importance of these diagnostic techniques in a disease such as plague is evident. The log-normal epidemic curve with a narrow dispersion of the incubation periods (see Fig. 119 -1) and the short interval for successful antibiotic therapy mandate recognition of the earliest cases if the bulk of the exposed are to be saved.

[118] [119] [120] [121] Sequencing of the smallpox genome has been completed for some Asian strains of variola major and one of variola minor. Other strains are being sequenced and will provide more information for probe design and treatment targets. 90 ",

However, detection of minute amounts of toxin (and contacts with samples from cases may prove fatal due to the toxin' s potency) would be difficult by current immunoassay systems such as ELISA platforms. 146 Detection techniques based on electrochemiluminescence and immunoliposomes are currently under development. 99, 147 PCR assays can be performed in cases of ingestion of contaminated food in order to detect the genetic material present in C. botulinum. If weaponized toxin is used in the absence of C. botulinum organisms, detection of the genetic material would be difficult and would rely on the presence of residual DNA after toxin purification procedures. If inhalational botulism is suspected, respiratory secretions and nasal swabs should be obtained as early as possible. Postmortem samples of liver and spleen can be used for detection of botulinum toxins.",
