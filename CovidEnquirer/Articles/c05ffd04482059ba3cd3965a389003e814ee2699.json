A pattern of emergence of higher molecular weight forms was observed. By using a cleavable cross-linker, aminopeptidase N was shown to cross-link both to itself and to its breakdown products as well as to dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Using this technique it was possible to identify three of the breakdown products as 45 kDa, 66 kDa and 95 kDa peptides. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was used to define the precise cleavage points for the bovine renal aminopeptidase N breakdown products. The short amino acid sequences obtained show strong sequence similarity with the human intestinal and rat kidney aminopeptidase N.",

Human and rat intestinal APN occurs as a symmetrical dimer of 130 kDa and rabbit APN occurs as a monomer [6] . SDS gel electrophoresis of pig APN shows at least three separate subunits [8, 9] , and a number of different structures for this enzyme have been postulated [10] . Some of the subunit forms of the pig enzyme are due to proteolysis in vivo or in vitro. In contrast only limited studies have been carried out on APN from renal brush borders. In an early report pig kidney APN was reported to form high molecular weight aggregates which dissociated into a 280 kDa which further dissociated to yield a subunit of 140 kDa [11] .",

Unlike the intestinal enzyme which hydrolyses dietary peptides, the renal enzyme has no established physiological function although it is present in great abundance. We have recently presented evidence to suggest that bovine renal APN plays a role in Na +-dependent amino acid transport in bovine brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV) [12] . A number of other studies have recently implicated similar proteins (i.e., polypeptides with only one transmembrane region) in the regulation of Na+-independent amino acid transport [13, 14] . A model for such a protein acting as some sort of transport system would be more feasible if the proteins had more than one transmembrane region. This could be achieved by association of the protein into oligomeric structures. A number of studies suggest that intestinal APN can form dimers and other structures with its breakdown products, but it is not known if this is also the case in renal membranes [9, 10] .",

            "text": "DMS is a non-cleavable cross-linker and was used initially to avoid ambiguities due to partial hydrolysis products that may result from the use of cleavable cross-linkers during SDS-PAGE analysis. In preliminary experiments, intact BBMV were incubated at room temperature in the presence and absence of the DMS as described in Methods. Aliqouts were removed at various time points and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Incubation of BBMV at room temperature in the absence of cross-linker led to a progressive decrease in the amount of high molecular weight material and a concomitant increase in lower molecular weight degradation products. In the presence of DMS, protein bands of higher molecular weight accumulated at the expense of lower molecular weight material. This indicates that DMS is able to cross-link proteins in intact BBMV. Fig. 1 presents a Western blot of DMS treated and untreated BBMV blotted with the monoclonal antibody FD19. This antibody reacts with the 130-150 kDa aminopeptidase N monomer of bovine renal brush borders (described in Refs. 19 and 12) . It also reacts with a 260 kDa band and a 45 kDa band in the BBMV preparation. After 110 min at room temperature the 260 kDa band from BBMV disappeared ( Fig. l(b) ) but this band, as well as the new aminopeptidase N-complexed material was seen when BBMV were incubated with DMS (Fig. 1 ). Further incubation in DMS (to 17 h) culminated in the production of Coomassie-stained products in the stacking section of the gel with very little material entering the separating part of the gel. It is probable from these observations that DMS is acting to stabilise higher molecular weight complexes already present in BBMV but prone to degradation during storage. This seems very likely since the 260 kDa APN complex is already present in BBMV but increased in quantity in the presence of DMS. The production of the smallest (45 kDa) breakdown product of APN which still has the FD19 recognised isotope is also prevented on addition of DMS ( Fig. 1, arrow 4) , and perhaps also re-associated into higher molecular weight products as suggested from Fig. l(c) where the 45 kDa product is no longer present.",

Without reduction of the cross-linker very little material entered the separating part of the gel suggesting that the APN was cross-linked to products of > 300 kDa (limit of size for entry into 8% gel). Since essentially only the 260 kDa and 45 kDa products of APN were released on reduction of the crosslinker, the bulk of APN appeared to be cross-linking to itself. It was of interest to determine whether APN could cross-link to any other membrane proteins in situ. Under conditions of limited proteolysis papain cleaves APN at the junctional peptide region thus removing a 125 kDa polypeptide containing the active site and the FD19 epitope into the supernatant (described in Ref. 12) . The anchoring peptide region remains in the membrane. Papain digestion after cross-linking would remove the majority of the APN which is cross-linked to itself. Any APN cross-linked to other membrane peptides or cross-linked to substructures of itself which do not contain the papain site would remain in the membrane. In this way, effectively a concentration effect is achieved for the rarer cross-linking events.",

Since the Nterminal sequence corresponds to an internal sequence of human [25] and rat [26] APN it is a breakdown product of the 130 kDa APN monomer and may be be formed by autolysis or cleavage by some other endogenous proteinase. This fragment was readily detected in Western blots and hence has the FD19-recognising epitope. The 95 kDa product is unlikely to have arisen from papain cleavage since it has the same N-terminus as the 45 kDa polypeptide. The peptide bond before this N-terminus is obviously labile and easily attacked. The 66 kDa product has a different sequence which is also found in the human APN and is hence also a breakdown product. This may have been produced by papain cleavage.

An aliquot of column purified fraction was incubated with DMS (60 rain, 22\u00b0C) and separated on SDS-PAG (10%). Scan a is control FD19 purified APN (5/~g) and scan b is after cross-linked (5/~g protein). Arrows 1 and 2 point to APN monomer and its45 kDa breakdown product, respectively. Arrows 3 and 4 point to the 220 kDa and 260 kDa complexes, respectively. Molecular mass markers: I, 211 kDa; II, 119 kDa; III, 64 kDa and IV, 44 kDa. X denotes the end of the gel. Immunoaffinity column purified aminopeptidase N complexes from DTBP cross-linekd BBMV. DTBP-treated BBMV were solubilised and passed through and FD19 column. Samples (5 pg) were resuspended in reducing or non-reducing buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%). Scan a, FD19 recognised protein from DTBP-treated BBMV, non-reducing buffer b, and a, but treated in reducing buffer. Arrows point to APN monomer (1); 45 kDa breakdown product (2); 260 kDa dimer (3) and unreduced cross-linked material (4). Molecular mass standards: I, 200 kDa; II, 116 kDa; III, 66 kDa; IV, 45 kDa. Western blots using FD19, on papain cleaved DTBP-treated BBMV. DTBP-treated BBMV were digested with papain (10 min, 22\u00b0C), centrifuged, solubilised and passed through and FD19 column. Samples of FD19 recognised protein (5 ~zg) were resuspended in non-reducing or reducing buffer and electrophoresed through SDS-PAG (8%) and Western blots using FD19 performed. Scan a, non-reduced APN complex; scan b, reduced APN complex. Arrows 1 and 2 point to APN monomer and its 45 kDa breakdown product, respectively. Arrow 3 points to the 260 kDa dimer and other arrows point to high molecular weight APN complexes. Polypeptides from DTBP-formed aminopeptidase N complexes. BBMV were cross-linked with DTBP and digested with papain. Proteins released from the membranes by papain were removed by centrifugation. Membrane pellets were solubilised and passed through an FD19 column. The eluted protein was dialysed, concentrated and resuspended in reducing buffer (15 min, 95-100\u00b0C). The reduced protein was again passed through an FD19 column and samples (2 /zg) of the stuck (scan a) and effluent (scan b) material was electrophoresed through and SDS-PAG (8%). The gels were silver stained.
