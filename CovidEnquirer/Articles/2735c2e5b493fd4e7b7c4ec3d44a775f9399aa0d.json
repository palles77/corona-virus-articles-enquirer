We studied 4 time-series algorithm modifi cations designed to improve sensitivity for detecting artifi cially added data. To test these modifi ed algorithms, we used reports of daily syndrome visits from 308 Department of Defense (DoD) facilities and 340 hospital emergency departments (EDs). At a constant alert rate of 1%, sensitivity was improved for both datasets by using a minimum standard deviation (SD) of 1.0, a 14-28 day baseline duration for calculating mean and SD, and an adjustment for total clinic visits as a surrogate denominator. Stratifying baseline days into weekdays versus weekends to account for day-of-week effects increased sensitivity for the DoD data but not for the ED data. These enhanced methods may increase sensitivity without increasing the alert rate and may improve the ability to detect outbreaks by using automated surveillance system data.",

            "text": "The C2 algorithm uses a sliding baseline of 7 consecutive recent days' counts to calculate a mean (\u03bc) and SD (s t ). The test statistic is (x t -\u03bc)/s t , the number of SDs by which the current value x t exceeds \u03bc, or 0 if x t does not exceed \u03bc. EARS uses a test statistic >3 to signal an alert (6, 7) . Owing to their simplicity, ease of implementation, and implicit correction for seasonal trends (only data from the prior 9 days are used), the EARS algorithms are widely used (8) (9) (10) . However, the algorithms do not perform optimally under all circumstances. First, because daily counts often vary by day of week, many alerts may be produced on high-count days such as Mondays and Tuesdays, and few may be produced on low-count days such as weekend days. Second, the short (7-day) baseline period may produce unstable values for the mean and SD; thus, the minimum daily count that triggers an alert may vary widely over a short period. Third, using simple count data does not account for the population at risk, which is generally unknown in these systems and which may vary, especially during crisis situations. Although C2 can be used on rates rather than counts, prior evaluations have not shown that using rates improves performance (L. Hutwagner, pers. comm.). Finally, occurrences of many disease indicators are rare, resulting in calculations for both expected values and SDs of 0; the EARS methods are not recommended in such instances. A minimum SD may be used to avoid division by zero, but if this minimum value is set to 0.2, a count of 1 will be 5 SDs above the mean and trigger a high-level alert.",

The fi rst modifi cation tested was stratifi cation by weekdays versus weekend days. Although many methods have been used to adjust for differing counts by day of week (11) , these methods may require customization to specifi c datasets and a long data history (up to several years). Our simple method is to stratify the baseline days used to calculate \u03bc and s t into weekdays versus weekend days. This stratifi cation is denoted the W2 algorithm. For example, a 7-day W2 baseline for weekdays contains the most recent 7 weekdays. For unstratifi ed and stratifi ed analyses, the 2 days immediately before the index day were excluded from the baseline, a standard practice for C2, to avoid contamination with the upswing of an outbreak.",

For the adjustment procedure, we used a formula in which n 0 = count of visits on the index day for the chosen syndrome (e.g., visits for the respiratory syndrome), and d 0 = the total number of facility visits on the index day, including visits that were both assigned and unassigned to any of the 11 syndromes. \u03a3n i = total syndrome visits summed for all i baseline days. \u03a3d i = total facility visits summed for all i baseline days. The formula for the adjusted expected value was e 0 = d 0 \u00d7 \u03a3n i /\u03a3d i , which differed considerably from the mean of the n i if d 0 was high or low. Fewer visits for a given syndrome were thus expected on a day when the facility had fewer total visits. The estimated adjusted SD, s 0 , was taken as the mean absolute value of (n i -d i \u00d7 \u03a3n i /\u03a3d i ) over i baseline days; that is, s 0 = \u03a3 (abs (n i -d i \u00d7 \u03a3n i /\u03a3d i ))/i. The test statistic adjusted for total visits was (n 0 -e 0 )/s 0 , analogous to the C2 statistic (n 0 -\u03bc)/ s t , where \u03bc and s t are the mean and SD of n i , the counts on baseline days.

The DoD data consisted primarily of data from outpatient clinics; however, \u224815% of the visits in this evaluation were from patients seen in emergency facilities and cannot currently be differentiated in the BioSense System. We studied the 11 syndrome groups designed to be indicative of infections resulting from exposure to pathogens plausibly used in a bioterrorist attack (4). The DoD data consisted of daily counts of patient visits with International Classifi cation of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9)-coded diagnoses categorized into the 11 syndrome groups. The hospital ED data consisted of freetext chief complaints, which were fi rst parsed for a specifi ed set of keywords, abbreviations, and misspellings and then categorized into 10 of the syndrome groups (1 syndrome, specifi c infection, was used for diagnosis but not for chief complaint data). Some ICD-9 codes and chief complaints may be included in >2 syndromes. However, counts of different syndromes were analyzed separately, not added together, and therefore are not double-counted in the analyses. For both datasets, we analyzed counts aggregated by facility. We included facility-syndrome combinations that had mean counts >0.5 over all facility-syndrome days in the study period. Many DoD clinics are closed on holidays. Therefore, for the DoD data, 11 days (days on which federal holidays are observed and the day after Thanksgiving) were recoded as weekend days for purposes of stratifi ed algorithm calculations (5) . Because hospital EDs typically are open on these holidays, no recoding for holidays was performed for this dataset.",

When we limited analysis to ED data with a mean count of 4 to <6 per day and explored sensitivity for detecting varying numbers of additional counts (Figure 2 ), we found, as expected, that as the number of additional counts increased, sensitivity increased. The difference between the initial and best algorithms was highest when sensitivity was \u224850% for the initial algorithm.

Depending on the dataset, mean count in the data, and the number of additional counts added, the enhanced methods may increase sensitivity by 20%-40%. These improvements were achieved without an increase in the alert rate, which was held constant at 1% for all methods. Although we chose a 1% alert rate for testing purposes, in practice, it is useful to vary the alert rate to fi t the circumstances, and the BioSense application enables the alert rate to be varied between 0.1% and 2%. Regardless of the alert rate used, the modifi ed methods have higher sensitivity. For the DoD and hospital ED datasets, sensitivity was improved by using a higher minimum SD of 1.0, a longer baseline duration of 28 days, and adjusting for total visits. Stratifying baseline days into weekdays versus weekends/ holidays increased sensitivity in the DoD data, which has a strong day-of-week effect, but modestly decreased sensitivity in the hospital ED data, which does not have such an effect. Thus, the best analytic methods depend on dataset characteristics, especially the day-of-week effect, and could be varied by manual or automated selection. These fi ndings can be used to improve both early event detection and situation awareness because accurate recognition of unusually high counts is needed for both uses.",

            "text": "These modifi cations were apparently effective for the following reasons. Accounting for total visits to the facility (i.e., rate method) produces a more accurate expected value and lower residuals ( Table 2 ). Although number of total visits is not the ideal denominator, in general it is better than no denominator at all. An advantage of the rate method is that calculations may be made when only partial data for a given day are available. However, adjusting for total visits may reduce sensitivity slightly in some subgroups, as we found for the hospital ED data when the mean count was 8 to <20. Stratifi cation by weekday versus weekend day improves expected value calculations when a substantial day-of-week effect exists, such as in the DoD data. When such an effect is not present, stratifi cation causes days further from the index day to be used in the baseline period, therefore producing slightly less accurate expected values. Longer baseline durations have no effect on the accuracy of expected value calculation and improve sensitivity by producing more accurate and stable SD values. Using a higher minimum SD avoids nuisance alerts that may be prompted by small fl uctuations in the daily visit count. This method also changes the distribution of test statistic values, which results in a lower 99th percentile cutoff value, which increases sensitivity for detecting moderate-to-high numbers of added counts. Using a higher minimum SD is benefi cial if disease indicators with low and high counts are analyzed; an alternate approach is to use different methods for lowversus high-count data. The issues focused on by our suggested modifi cations may alternately be addressed by various sophisticated mathematical modeling approaches. However, health departments, which are generally limited in resources and in analysis expertise, may resist use of decision-support methods that are expensive, diffi cult to implement, or not transparent to human data monitors. For example, sophisticated Serfl ing-type regression models have long been used by CDC for tracking the progress of infl uenza season (13, 14) and have been used to analyze selected data in the Bio-Sense system. However, these models have both strengths and weaknesses and have not been widely embraced for daily disease surveillance. Even if the expertise and hardware capability for applying them were made available to local health departments, many time series are unsuitable for this approach. We present simple and easily understood and implemented enhancements to C2 to extend its applicability and improve its performance. These enhancements may be applicable to other control chart-based algorithms as well.",

Even when using these suggested modifi cations, sensitivity for detecting additional counts at the facility level remains modest. However, the utility of automated biosurveillance will be expanded with the availability of better population coverage and more specifi c data, the use of multiple data types in combination, and improved detection algorithms, such as those proposed here. The limitations of this study include using only data with a mean count >0.5 per day; analyses of sparser data might show different results. We studied only facility-level aggregation of data, selected patient types (e.g., hospital inpatients were not studied), selected data types (e.g., ED diagnoses were not studied), and broadly defi ned syndromes (the more granular subsyndromes, which are likely to yield lower counts, were not studied). Although we evaluated only a simple time-series detection method, optimizing performance of simple methods is useful before they can be meaningfully compared with more sophisticated methods, such as regression. Also, we studied effects of additional counts on single days rather than multiday outbreak effects; however, because the C2 algorithm considers data from only 1 day at a time, this is a reasonable initial approach. These results must be confi rmed by trials of multiday signal injection and performance evaluated for multiple subgroups (e.g., syndrome, day of week, season). We adopted the approach of evaluating sensitivity at a fi xed 1% alert rate defi ned empirically for each algorithm and dataset, as used by Jackson et al. (12) . Our approach is in accord with a recent review that recommended basing alert thresholds on empirical data rather than on classical statistical theory (17) . A major strength of the study is that BioSense is a national system that provided access to 2 major datasets with differing characteristics and to data from hundreds of facilities in many states. The length, geographic spread, and syndrome variation of the study datasets lend weight to the results.",
