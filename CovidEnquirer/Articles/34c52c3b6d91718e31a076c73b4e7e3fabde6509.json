LT patients typically have a 1-and 3-year survival of 77% and 59%, respectively. Infections are the major cause of death often linked to rejection, most commonly manifested as bronchiolitis obliterans (BO).

For instance, it has been shown that patients colonized with Burkholderia cenocepacia (genovar III) have a much lower survival rate than patients colonized with other species of the B. cepacia complex (4) . For this reason, many transplant programs may refuse to perform transplants on patients colonized with B. cenocepacia. Surgeons who do perform transplants on patients colonized with these bacteria often use broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in the peri-and post-operative periods. Cystic fibrosis patients with a single LT may be at greater risk of pneumonia, as the native lung functions as a reservoir for these resistant pathogens (5) . Laboratory diagnosis of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections requires the use of only routine culture media along with manual or automated identification and antimicrobial susceptibility methods. Most organisms can be fully identified, with antibiotic susceptibility results available within 48 h. However, fastidious and/or uncommon organisms may need the use of special media and incubation conditions, requiring additional time for isolation and complete identification (6) .",

Five of the remaining 6 patients developed evidence of subclinical disease after 3 months, and 4 of the 6 eventually developed symptoms.

This may be due to the higher degree of immunosuppressive therapy used in these patients compared to other transplant recipients. Besides life-threatening pneumonitis, CMV can cause hepatitis, enteritis, and colitis after transplantation. CMV may also predispose individuals to bacteremia, Aspergillus infection, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Most worrisome, CMV disease is associated with BO. Different strategies are employed to prevent CMV disease after LT (see \"Heart Transplant\" below for laboratory diagnosis of CMV). Most commonly, prophylaxis with valganciclovir is used due to ease of administration. In lung transplantation, longer courses (6 months or greater) of antiviral therapy may be used (10) . Ganciclovir resistance may occur, requiring treatment with higher doses of ganciclovir or foscarnet. These high doses increase the side effect of bone marrow suppression, specifically, leukopenia.",

In addition, respiratory viral infections are a risk factor for both acute and chronic rejection (13) . In a comparison of 50 LT recipients with respiratory viral infections and 50 without infections, 8 of the infected patients developed BO 3 months post-infection compared with none in the uninfected cohort patient population (14) . Laboratory diagnosis of viral infections may require the use of routine cell cultures, shell vial cell cultures, immunofluorescence techniques, rapid immunoblot or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing, or molecular analysis. Due to the relatively low sensitivity and specificity of many of the rapid tests, confirmatory testing by other methods is usually required, and the use of molecular analysis is becoming more commonplace. Specifically, multiplex molecular testing is detecting increases in mixed viral infections, which were not previously detected using traditional viral culture methods.

Diagnosis can be made via scrapings or biopsy of mucosal surfaces, by positive culture of a sterile site, or by histological staining of the involved organ. Diagnosis is commonly established by culture, since Candida spp. are easily grown on routine media used in mycology laboratories and are readily identified by commercially available systems (35) .
