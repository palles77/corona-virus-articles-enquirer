Thus chemotherapy is a treatment mainstay, even in poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status [2, 3] . Bone marrow involvement or paraneoplastic syndrome is common in patients with SCLC [4] . Hematologic abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are reported to be occasionally accompanied by bone marrow metastasis or paraneoplastic phenomenon [5, 6] . However, complications such as fatal hemorrhage are rarely reported. The clinical presentation can make diagnosis or treatment difficult.

An arterial blood gas study revealed pH 7.44, PaCO 2 37.5 mmHg, PaO 2 77.6 mmHg, HCO 3 25 mmol/L, and SpO 2 95% on room air. Complete blood count results were as follows: leukocytes 6,270/mm 3 (neutrophil 61.2%, lymphocyte 27.5%, monocyte 3.9%, eosinophil 3.9%, and basophil 0.7%), hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL, hematocrit 29.6%, and platelets 11,000/mm 3 . The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 1,324 IU/L; C-reactive protein, 6.40 mg/dL. Hepatic and renal function testing were within normal range. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer were within normal range as well. A 1.6 cm sized mass in the lower lobe of the right lung and multiple lymphadenopathies in mediastinal and right supraclavicular areas were noted on chest CT scan ( Fig.  1) . A peripheral blood smear revealed leukoerythroblastosis with nucleated erythrocyte, left shifted neutrophils. Anti-platelet antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative. Anti-nuclear antibody was within Pulmonary hemorrhage at SCLC presentation normal range (1:20). Because of the risk of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia, a bronchoscopic examination was not feasible and was postponed. A bone marrow examination was not performed because the patient was unable to maintain prone position due to dyspnea. Platelet concentrates and packed red blood cells were started, given daily, and dexamethasone, 40 mg was intravenously administered for four days. However, his platelet count remained stationary (Fig. 2) . On the fifth day after admission, cytological examination of his sputum yielded a diagnosis of SCLC. Metastatic lesions were not observed on brain MRI and bone scintigraphy.",

However, hematologic abnormalities resulting from bone marrow metastasis and paraneoplastic phenomenon are not as common as those resulting from anti-cancer therapy [5, 6] . Severe thrombocytopenia developed rapidly and was refractory to platelet transfusion and dexamethasone administration. In addition, tests for anti-platelet antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were negative and anti-nuclear antibody was within normal range. These findings indicate that autoimmune disease was not likely to be the cause of thrombocytopenia [9] . Bone marrow examination is a diagnostic process for evaluating hematological abnormality or staging the disease. However, it rarely changes the stage [10] and bone marrow as an isolated metastatic site is found in fewer than 5% of SCLC patients [3] . Leukoerythroblastic reaction on peripheral blood smear is suggestive of bone marrow metastasis in the present case [11, 12] . Although bronchoscopy may be considered for localization or treatment in massive hemoptysis, it is contraindicated in a patient with severe thrombocytopenia [13] .",
