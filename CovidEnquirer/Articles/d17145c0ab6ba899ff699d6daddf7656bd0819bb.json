            "text": "Eight accessory proteins have been identified in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). They are believed to play roles in the viral life cycle and may contribute to the pathogenesis and virulence. ORF9b as one of these accessory proteins is located in subgenomic mRNA9 and encodes a 98 amino acid protein. However, whether 9b protein is a structural component of SARS-CoV particles remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 9b protein is translated from bicistronic mRNA9 via leaky ribosome scanning and it is incorporated into both virus-like particles (VLPs) and purified SARS-CoV virions. Further analysis shows that sufficient incorporation of 9b protein into VLPs is dependent upon the coexpression of E and M proteins, but not upon the presence of either S or N protein. Our data indicate that 9b protein of SARS-CoV is another virion-associated accessory protein. This finding will lead to a better understanding of the properties of the SARS-CoV 9b protein.",

In 2003, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the aetiological agent for this disease Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . The genome of SARS-CoV is a plus-stranded single RNA which is 29,727 nucleotides in length excluding the polyadenylation tract at the 3\u2032 end . Fourteen ORFs have been identified, which translate into two replicative polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), 4 structural proteins (S, E, M, N) and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9b) (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The accessory proteins are unique to SARS-CoV, as they have little homology in amino acid sequence with accessory proteins of other coronaviruses.",

Our previous study also shows that 3a protein functions as an ion channel to facilitate virus release (Lu et al., 2006) . In addition, ORF7a protein was also characterized as a virion-associated protein of SARS-CoV (Huang et al., 2006a) , which induces apoptosis ((Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2004) and arrests the cell cycle when over-expressed (Yuan et al., 2006) . Subsequently, both SARS-CoV ORF6 and ORF7b proteins were determined to be incorporated into virus particles (Huang et al., 2007; Schaecher et al., 2007) . ORF6 protein was further reported to function as an IFN antagonist and to accelerate replication of a related mouse virus (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Tangudu et al., 2007) . Four other accessory proteins have Virology 388 (2009) [279] [280] [281] [282] [283] [284] [285] not been well investigated, and some of them may be included in virions and have important functions (Tan et al., 2006) .",

To further investigate the properties of SARS-CoV 9b protein, purified recombinant 9b protein was used to produce both anti-9b polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The expression of 9b protein in SARS-CoV infected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-9b monoclonal antibody.

The 9b protein encoded by an internal ORF starts at the 18th nucleotide downstream of the transcription regulatory sequence of mRNA9 . The start codon for ORF9b is very close to the start codon for ORFN, with only 10 nucleotides in between (Fig.  1A ). To confirm that 9b protein can be translated from an mRNA corresponding to the SARS-CoV subgenomic RNA9, the sequence encoding ORFN which contains ORF9b was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS and transfected into 293T cells. The results showed that 9b protein was able to be expressed in cells transfected with plasmids containing the N gene coding region ( Fig. 1C ORFN) , but that the expression level was relatively weaker compared with that of cells transfected with ORF9b alone (Fig. 1C ORF9b) . When the ORF9b initiation codon was mutated from ATG to ACG ( Fig. 1C N(9b \u2212 )), 9b protein was not expressed while the expression level of N protein showed little change. When the ORFN initiation codon was mutated from ATG to ATC ( Fig. 1C N(N \u2212 ) ), N protein was not expressed while the expression level of 9b protein dramatically increased. These data not only demonstrated the expression of 9b protein from the N gene coding region, but also led us to further investigate the translation regulatory mechanism for 9b protein.",

Analysis of the sequence flanking the initiation codon of ORFN and ORF9b showed that the initiation of the N gene represented a suboptimal Kozak context (A at \u22123, T at +4), while the initiation of the 9b gene indicated an optimal Kozak context (A at \u22123, G at +4) (Kozak, 1986) . In addition, a lower expression level of 9b protein had been observed already in cells transfected with ORFN and then in cells transfected with ORF9b or N (N \u2212 ). All of these findings make it reasonable to presume that the translation initiation of ORF9b is regulated by a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism under which the downstream gene expression is affected by the translation efficiency of the upstream gene (Kozak, 1987 (Kozak, , 1989 . To test this, a more ideal Kozak context was induced in ORFN ( Fig. 1C ORFN + 4T to G). We detected an obviously decreased expression level of 9b protein as expected. Meanwhile, when the Kozak context of ORFN was changed to a much weaker one ( Fig. 1C ORFN \u22123A to C), an increased expression of 9b protein was observed. Together, these data suggest that ORF9b protein is translated via a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism.",

            "text": "After the first SARS-CoV accessory protein, 3a, had been identified as a structural component of virions, accessory proteins 7a, 7b, and 6 were subsequently determined to be incorporated into virions (Huang et al., 2006a (Huang et al., , 2007 Ito et al., 2005; Schaecher et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2005) . Here, our data further indicate that 9b protein is the fifth virion-associated accessory protein of SARS-CoV to be recognized. Analysis of VLPs and purified SARS-CoV particles showed that the highest level of 9b protein was detected in the fractions also abundant in S, N, and M proteins. While this property is almost equivalent among these accessory structural proteins, they do exhibited different biochemical characteristics. Some, such as 3a and 6 proteins, are released from expressing cells, while others, like 7a and 9b proteins, are not detectable in the supernatant of expressing cells. As a result, the release of the protein itself is seen not to be a determinant of incorporation. The localization of these proteins to intracellular vesicle components like Golgi and ER may help them to be incorporated through mechanisms bringing them close to the site of virus assembly. The mechanism of incorporating accessory proteins into virus particles is still not well understood and must be further studied. Furthermore, it will be important to address the necessity of incorporation of all these accessory proteins into virions.",

This result was similar to what was found with 7a protein; the release of these two accessory proteins with E protein may be caused by their incorporation into putative E protein-containing vesicles (Maeda et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2006a) . When M protein but not S or N protein was added, the release of 9b into the medium was increased markedly, indicating that E and M proteins are sufficient to allow incorporation of 9b protein into virus-like particles. This is consistent with former studies showing that E and M proteins could form smooth virus-like particles when co-expressed, while S and N were unnecessary for VLP formation (Hsieh et al., 2005; Mortola and Roy, 2004) . As we do not have evidence for interactions between 9b and E or M proteins, we cannot determine whether the incorporation of 9b protein into VLPs generated by E and M co-expressing cells is caused by the physical associations among them. However, this mechanism requires further examination.",

There are also coordinate proteins similar to SARS-CoV 9b which are so-called \"Internal\" or \"I\" proteins in other group II coronaviruses (Fischer et al., 1997; Lapps et al., 1987; Senanayake and Brian, 1997) . In MHV, I protein is an accessory viral structural protein which can contribute to plaque morphology (Fischer et al., 1997) . In our study, I protein of SARS-CoV (9b protein) was also shown to be a structural component of the virions. It is reasonable to propose that 9b protein of SARS-CoV may also play a role in the viral life cycle. However, a more thorough functional analysis of 9b protein still must be performed. Although a recent study with SARS-CoV accessory protein deletion mutants showed little effect on pathogenicity in a mouse model (Dediego et al., 2008) , these accessory proteins, including 9b protein, may still play a supportive role in the viral life cycle in patients.",
