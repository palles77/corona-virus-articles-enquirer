            "text": "Eukaryotic mRNAs are generally monocistronic, with Y-proximal AUGs which are used as start sites for translation. However, examples of mRNAs which initiate at more than one AUG have been described. These mRNAs are translated into two (or more) completely different proteins or long and short protein isoforms (1) . Most cases are limited to mRNAs of viruses including influenza B virus (2) infectious bronchitis coronavirus (3) reovirus (4, 5) , rotavirus (S), barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (7) turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus (8) and cucumber necrosis tombusvirus (9). Rice dwarf phytoreovirus (RDV) (10, 1 I), a member of the family Reoviridae, has a genome composed of 12-segmented doublestranded (ds) RNA (Sl-S12). Each segment reported so far has been shown to have a single long open reading frame (ORF) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . However, during the course of sequence analysis of RDV S12, we have found that the segment has an out-of-frame, overlapping small ORF as well as a large ORF. In the current study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of RDV S12 and showed that transcripts from a full-length cDNA of S12 specified the large ORF-encoded polypeptide and long and short versions of the small ORF-coded proteins in an in vitro wheat germ translation system. Furthermore, we found that the corresponding small ORF is conserved in S9s of two other members of the genus Phytoreovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) (22) and wound tumor virus (WTV) (23).",

The previous sequence analyses (13, 16, l&23,32) showed the corre-sponding segment assignment of WTV and RDV, and suggested that RDV S12 and WTV S9 remain to be assigned on the basis of size similarity. However, no amino acid sequence homology with a score of more than 33 (33) was found between RDV P12 and the WTV SS-encoded nonstructural protein (Pnsl 0, 345 amino acids). With regard to RGDV, RGDV S9 has been shown to have a 5'-noncoding sequence virtually identical to that of WTV S9 (22), although the RGDV SS-encoded polypeptide (323 amino acids) has no significant sequence homology with WTV PnslO or any RDVcoded proteins. Surprisingly, however, careful inspection revealed that both WTV S9 and RGDV S9 also encode small polypeptides (PSOPs) which have significant sequence homologies, scores of which are more than 100, with RDV P12OP. The small ORFs of WTV S9 and RGDV S9 were previously unrecognized.",

The sequence alignment and identity among the three viruses are shown in Fig. 3 . The amino acid sequence similarities between RDV P120Pa and RGDV P9OP, between RDV P120Pa and WTV P9OP, and between RGDV P9OP Percentage identity in the optimal pair-wise alignments including gaps are indicated to the left of the second column. Identical amino acid residues, which are the same for at least two viruses, are shaded. Amino acid sequence of RDV S12 was cited from this study, that of RGDV S9 from Koganezawa et a/. (22) and that of WlV S9 from Anzola et al. (23) . and WTV P9OP are 31. 6, 29.3, and 25 .696, respectively. Two regions (residues 33 to 39 and residues 57 to 64 on RDV P120Pa) are well conserved. Thus the three segments seem to have the same ancestral origin, and the small ORF might have been more conserved than the large one during the course of evolution.",

P12 (33 kDa) was assumed to be translated from the long ORF, while P120Pa and P120Pb were considered to be isoforms from the same reading frame. Although the mechanism by which RDV S12 is tricistronic remains unknown, leaky scanning is a distinct possibility, since the first AUGs of the large and small ORFs deviate from the consensus sequence (34) in either or both positions -3 and +4, and no frame contains an AUG triplet between the first AUG codons of the two ORFs. The conservation of the internal small ORF in the other phytoreoviruses, WTV and RGDV, strongly suggests that the small ORF-encoded protein may be expressed in viva and play an important role during their life cycle.",
