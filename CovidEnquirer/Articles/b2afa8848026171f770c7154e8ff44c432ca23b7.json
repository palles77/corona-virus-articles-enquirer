This nested assay was designed on an alignment of our HKU1-positive sample sequence (BRA169) and different HKU1 genotype sequences deposited in GenBank. Primers Fn-HKU1 (forward 5\u2032-CGTGCYA TGCCAAATATTTTGCG-3\u2032, HKU1-NC_006577, nt 15433-15454) and Rn-HKU1 (reverse 5\u2032-TAGCAACC GCCACACATAAC-3\u2032, HKU1-NC_ 006577, nt 15562-15581) produced an amplicon of 149 bp. The nested PCR was run in a 50-\u03bcL reaction comprising 10 \u03bcL of PCR product, 1.5 units of DNA Polymerase (Biotools, Madrid, Spain), 1 \u03bcmol/L of each primer, 200 \u03bcmol/L of each dNTP (Applied Biosystems), 2 mmol/L MgCl 2 , and 1\u00d7 buffer. PCR mixtures were heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 62\u00b0C, and 40 s at 72\u00b0C, followed by a fi nal 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Clinical samples positive for HKU1 were used as positive controls in the HKU1 nested PCR. All fragments obtained from PCR and nested PCR were analyzed in a 2% (wt/ vol) agarose gel by electrophoresis, stained with 0.5 \u03bcg/mL of ethidium bromide, and subsequently sequenced to confi rm the type of coronavirus. Nucleotide sequencing reactions were performed on both amplicon strands by using an ABI PRISM Big Dye Cycle Sequencing Kit with the ABI PRISM 3100 automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems).",

Azithromycin regimens have been commonly used for treatment of M. genitalium infections (3). However, failure of azithromycin treatment has been reported in cases of M. genitalium-positive nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) (4, 5) , and macrolideresistant strains of M. genitalium have been isolated from case-patients in Australia, Sweden, and Norway for whom azithromycin treatment has failed (4, 5) . In these strains, mutations in the 23S rRNA gene were associated with macrolide resistance, and mutations in ribosomal protein genes L4 and L22 were also found (5) . Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance of M. genitalium is essential to identify antimicrobial resistant strains and to then determine appropriate treatment. Coculture of patient specimens with Vero cells has improved the primary isolation rate of M. genitalium from clinical specimens and offered some current clinical strains for antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing (6) . To determine their antimicrobial susceptibilities, a molecular real-time PCR method has been developed (7, 8) . However, isolating M. genitalium from clinical specimens and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates remain labor-intensive, time-consuming tasks. In addition, no methods are available to directly determine antimicrobial drug susceptibilities of M. genitalium in clinical specimens. To monitor macrolide susceptibilities in clinical",
