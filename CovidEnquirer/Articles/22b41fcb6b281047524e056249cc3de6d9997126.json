As time went on, many other complications of the disease and also of the treatment became apparent. Neuropsychiatric manifestations were among these complications. We saw patients attempted suicide during quarantine period, delirium was not uncommon [5] , and many were anxious and worrying. Furthermore, many patients had neuropsychiatric symptoms persisted after discharge, and some patients developed new symptoms in the recovery phase. SARS had strong reasons to cause adverse neuropsychiatric impacts. It affected the whole family, either as being patients or patient contacts that required quarantine observations. High dose corticosteroids we used in the treatment, especially in the early epidemic when our knowledge on SARS was limited, had exposed patients to possible steroid related adverse effects. SARS was also a lethal disease and many patients required mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICU) . Because of the contagious nature and unknown route of transmission, the disease carried a negative stigmatization. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the relative contributions of disease severity, use of corticosteroids and social factors on the symptoms in various neuropsychiatric domains in acute and convalescent phases.",

The questionnaires were administered by mail in early June 2003 with return envelopes. To encourage reply we gave phone call to all patients before sending them questionnaires. One of the questionnaires, the SARS Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Checklist (NPSC), was specifically designed to evaluate the neuropsychiatric complaints after SARS according to our initial experiences [5] . It consisted of 25 items covering six neuropsychiatric domains of interest (see Appendix for questionnaire), namely cognition (Q1-4), mania (Q5-8), depression (Q9-15), anxiety (Q16-18), psychosis (Q19-21) and behavioural symptoms (Q22-25). The items were scored on a four-point ordinal scale with '0' representing 'none' and '3' 'always'. This questionnaire was duplicated into four. Two questionnaires were administered by patients and two were administered by their families. The first set was rated to the best of their recall during hospital stay (at acute phase), and the second set was rated according to their present state (at convalescent phase). The questionnaires administered by family members served to evaluate the reliability of the information provided by the patient. Severity of the SARS symptoms was recorded on a separate eight-item checklist using an ordinal scale from 0 to 3, which gave a maximum possible score of 24. We also included General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ28) as a screening tool for psychological well being at convalescent phase [3] . The study was approved by local ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from every participant.",

We believed families were difficult to observe the behavioural changes because they were not allowed to have direct patient contact during hospital stay.

We learnt that at least four other studies were carried at the same time, and some patients did not want to join too many different studies. The age distribution and proportion of health care workers in our replied sample were similar to the Hong Kong cohort [25] , but the male gender was underrepresented in our sample (34.3% in the sample vs. 44.3% in Hong Kong cohort). We did not have a good reason to explain this difference. In a post hoc survey on the utilization of clinical psychology service by SARS patients, we found our study sample was comparable to non-responders as well as the Hong Kong cohort, suggesting a similar psychological outcome. We believed our sample was representative of the Hong Kong SARS. We admitted difficulty in assessing the accuracy of information collected, although the worry was partially offset by the good item correlation in the family valued answers. The pattern of correlation, in which easily observed symptoms were better correlated than the difficult ones, suggested an independent rating in the questionnaires.",

Many of the anxiety-depression symptoms were adjustment reactions during acute stage of illness, and some of the symptoms like insomnia and poor concentration could also represent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which was expected to be common in this epidemic. Although we did not have information on psychological well being in the community during the epidemic as a control, our findings did show an impact from the factors we studied on the neuropsychiatric symptoms, both at acute and convalescent phases. Our patients were treated in isolation settings and had lots of uncertainties on their health. These were similar to patients treated in ICU where many have developed PTSD as a result [10, 11] . We believed these constituted the main unmeasured variances and might also explain the inability of our questionnaire to show up the ICU impact.",

Some felt guilty on transmitting the disease to their families, and some staffs found themselves being isolated from other colleagues. They also worried about potential occupational hazards in the future, compensation issues, insurances, new hospital policies, etc. To address the importance of psychological health, the hospital has incorporated psychology sessions in the newly implemented infection control trainings.

Chronic stimulation in the case of Cushing's disease could cause atrophy of the hippocampus [27] . Poor memory could also be a symptom of CFS which frequently accompanied with viral infections [6] .
