Our current approach to an effective biosecurity response is clearly inadequate to address the challenge posed by these rapidly emerging infectious agents. Every time a new virus poses a threat, we tend to re-invent the wheel instead of building on proven technology. It is time for a critical ''pause\" and an evaluation of how we can best deploy available tools to protect ourselves against emerging disease threats.",

            "text": "Vaccines are essential tools for stopping or reducing the impact of a disease or an infection. They are intended to protect healthy populations, but proving they are safe and effective often requires very large human clinical studies. Furthermore, the infecting agent needs to be in active circulation and, depending on its attack rate, the number of subjects required to provide regulatory authorities with convincing evidence of vaccine efficacy can be substantial. For example, if the attack rate for an infectious agent is 5%, 20 times as many subjects would be required for a clinical trial than if the entire population were infected. For this and other reasons, vaccine development is challenging, and it often takes decades to generate the required data using a traditional vaccine development approach. This obviously conflicts with the need for speed, which is essential when dealing with an acute biosecurity threat. Thus we need to rethink our overall strategy for developing vaccines to counter emerging virus diseases. The development of Protein Science's recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) influenza vaccine (Flublok \u00d2 ) to combat a possible influenza pandemic provides some important lessons for successful vaccine development: speed, safety and scaleability.",

            "text": "The baculovirus-insect cell expression technology (BEST) is an established platform for producing complex proteins. This production platform has been extensively studied for producing viral and parasitic antigens [1] . More recently, it has demonstrated its suitability as a commercial manufacturing technology [2] . Its major advantage is that it is a ''Plug and Play\" system that uses the same cells and baculovirus backbone into which a protective antigen of interest can be inserted [3] . The BEST production platform does not require the amplification and subsequent inactivation of large quantities of infectious virus, and therefore does not require a high-level biocontainment manufacturing environment. This has a number of clear advantages: manufacturing personnel are not exposed to infectious agents and the escape of live viruses during production is impossible. Moreover, the manufacturing process can be readily introduced into any country with an existing bioreactor capacity, which should enable rapid expansion and availability of locally produced vaccine. For example, in Japan, UNIGEN Inc. built 2 \u00c2 21,000-L bioreactor capacity, enough to supply millions of doses of vaccine in a relatively short time. This facility could produce sufficient monovalent bulk rHA protein to manufacture approximately one million doses of a 15 lg rHA-containing influenza vaccine within a 5-day production cycle. For global pandemic vaccine production, 425 million doses of a vaccine containing 10 lg rHA/dose could be produced within one month if 25% of the global bioreactor capacity (or 500,000 L) could be allocated to rHA vaccine production [4] . Furthermore, use of this technology might avoid serious political obstacles for exporting vaccine from manufacturing to non-manufacturing countries as occurred in 1976 when the U.S. prohibited pandemic vaccine export in anticipation of a potential swine flu outbreak. BEST-based manufacturing of an rHA pandemic vaccine might permit the export of large quantities to other countries.",

This outbreak was especially alarming because the usual egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing process was incapable of producing an H5N1 vaccine: the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus killed the chick embryos used for ordinary vaccine production. However, the cDNA encoding the hemagglutinin gene of the avian H5N1 virus was used to produce an H5 rHA vaccine. Within a period of six weeks, an H5 rHA antigen was produced and first tested in chickens. Animal tests subsequently confirmed the immunogenicity of this product and, more importantly, showed that it protected chickens from a lethal viral challenge [6] . Unfortunately, following this initial success, it took another 15 years of development and approximately USD 250 million to obtain a FDA license for a seasonal influenza rHA vaccine (Flublok).",

Technical challenges were largely due to the need to annually adjust of the vaccine's HA antigen within the limited time available and the fact that BEST manufacturing platform had yet to be accepted for any vaccine destined for human use. Regulatory challenges and the complexity of product licensure increased exponentially with the number of novel elements included in the process. The mechanism of action of the Flublok vaccine is similar to that of the licensed inactivated influenza vaccines; i.e., the induction of antibodies against hemagglutinin. Flublok is also standardized to contain a certain amount of HA using the same potency method that is used for egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs). However, as a novel vaccine, Flublok contained three times more hemagglutinin antigen (45 lg instead of 15 lg HA) and was produced using a novel cell substrate The regulatory challenge would have been easier if Protein Sciences had first developed an rHA vaccine with the same antigen content as regularly licensed influenza vaccines and later developed another vaccine with a higher antigen content as an improved variant to serve more vulnerable populations such as the elderly. Finally, Flublok development nearly failed because of difficulty in securing adequate funding. Support from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) was essential in providing the funding necessary to complete Flublok's development and obtain FDA approval for use in adults 18 years of age and older.",

For many of the emerging virus diseases, the protective antigen is already known or can be readily identified through animal studies.
