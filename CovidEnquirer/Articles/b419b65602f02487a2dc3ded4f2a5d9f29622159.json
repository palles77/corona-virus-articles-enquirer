Examples include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in southern China in 2002 2 and the pandemic influenza A (pH1N1) virus that was first reported in Mexico in 2009. 3 Recent evidence, including analyses of the spread of pH1N1, 4e6 has demonstrated how quickly transmissible diseases can be spread by air travelers. 7, 8 Due to these health issues, the dramatic increase of international aviation travel and security concerns, the term \"border\" no longer denotes a static, fixed entity that begins and ends at political boundaries, but instead has been extended virtually to include pre-and post-travel geotemporal space. 9 Because of this global interconnectedness, adverse health consequences and economic and travel disruptions can result from the emergence of rapidly spreading novel communicable diseases anywhere in the world. 1 Whenever global or regional public health threats emerge, countries predictably implement mitigation measures at their international points of entry. 4,10e12 Anticipating how such events will emerge and unfold is the essence of preparedness planning, and a critical practice for public health authorities who wish to mitigate the impact of such events. 13 Previous aviation point of entry modeling studies have evaluated the potential effectiveness of some measures for mitigating global outbreaks of communicable disease, such as improving the timeliness of diagnostic testing for epidemic diseases, 14, 15 and rapidly developing and distributing sufficient quantities of pharmaceutical countermeasures, such as vaccines and antimicrobial drugs. 6,16e18 Post-pH1N1 airport-based public health interventions including traveler screening have been described. 19 While collectively these reports remain useful in analyzing the potential value of public health interventions at airports, to our knowledge no studies have used modeling to provide operational planning guidance assumptions for policy makers and public health authorities who would implement such measures.",

More specifically, we examined the time-course for infectious air travelers to arrive in the United States (U.S.) from international cities with the highest U.S.-bound flight traffic for the month of February. Previous U.S. modeling and planning efforts for point of entry response to pandemic influenza assumed a system-wide \"all or nothing\" initiation of traveler screening, aligned with World Health Organization phases. Temporal and geographical risk-based response stratification was underrepresented in those analyses, while spatial considerations and disease epidemiological characteristics guided most airport response planning. This paper describes a method that would allow for a more flexible approach, which could be applied to threats other than pandemic influenza. We used a traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model 20, 21 and an illustrative scheduled-flight dataset, to demonstrate how public health authorities could prioritize the allocation of responseresources in the U.S. at point of entry in response to a novel disease that was spreading rapidly outside of North America.",

The model propagates disease based on population sizes from metropolitan areas using calculations that estimate the dynamics of disease spread within each city and by air travel of individuals from one city to another, as previously described and calibrated by Epstein et al. and Bobashev et al. 20, 21 The simulated population is mutually assigned into one of the following disease states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatically infectious (I_s), asymptomatically infectious (I_a), and recovered (R). These disease states are illustrated in Fig. 1 . A person can move from being susceptible, to exposed, then to either asymptomatically or symptomatically infectious prior to recovery. The model is implemented such that people in the infectious state have a 66.67% chance of being symptomatic and a 33.33% chance of being asymptomatic. 18 People who transition to the recovered state would no longer be susceptible and remain in the recovered state for the duration of the simulation. Unlike prior implementation of this model, people in the infectious states were disallowed from entering a dead state in part to maximize person-to-person spread in the early stages of a pandemic and to create an upper boundary for this modeling study. As such the case-fatality proportion was intentionally set to zero.",

The 70% load factor is consistent with information reported by the Bureau of Transportation and Statistics for the average of scheduled and non-scheduled flights (http://www.bts.gov). The flight matrix used in this study is available upon request.

The 10-person threshold was selected on the basis of a 2005 report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Infrastructure and Simulation Analysis Center, which showed that the arrival of as few as 10 infected people would be sufficient to propagate a disease in the U.S. for simulations seeded with an attack rate of 25% or greater. 28 In this case, \"attack rate\" referred to the cumulative number of people infected at the peak of the pandemic, normalized by the population at the start of the pandemic. In a given simulation, the 10 symptomatically infectious people used to determine the early disease arrival time could be 10 infectious travelers arriving in the U.S., or a combination of infectious travelers and people within the U.S. who became infected following contact with an infectious traveler.",

Although the model can be implemented with flight data files reflecting true traveler patterns across city pairs for each simulated increment in time, we choose to use representative data from the month of Feb. 2009 for the purpose of this prepandemic baseline study.

In order to replicate the mean incidence rate of 0.997%, we evaluated two parameters: 1) The basic reproduction number, which represents a measure of the average number of people in a totally susceptible population to whom one infected individual transmits a disease, was allowed to vary between 1.4 and 1.7 in increments of 0.01. 2) The number of days it takes the model to predict the targeted mean incidence rate which best matches July 23, 2009, i.e., the 165th day after Feb 15th, 2009. We confirmed that our model generated a U.S. incidence rate of 1.0482% (standard deviation of 0.0067%) on the 165th day after disease onset for an R 0 of 1.53; these parameters are very close to the reported mean incidence rate of 0.997% by July 23, 2009.

Point of entry interventions for influenza have been questioned, for example, because of the many travelers who could be infected but not symptomatic at the time of entry (thus avoiding detection), greatly reducing the efficacy of any public health intervention. Computer simulations have demonstrated that even drastic travel restrictions (e.g., border closure) would achieve only limited delays in the introduction of a severe novel influenza virus, for example, into the U.S. during the early stages of an outbreak. 17,20,30,40e42 Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) discouraged point of entry screening measures both before and during pH1N1, 43e45 and the WHO Director-General Margaret Chan asserted very early in the pandemic that travel restrictions would be counterproductive and \"serve no purpose\". 37, 46 However, prudence dictates planning for such a contingency as one possible component of a comprehensive and coordinated public health response to an emerging disease threat. There are many drivers behind the decision to screen aviation travelers during novel communicable disease outbreaks spreading regionally or globally; despite recommendations to the contrary, and known and potential limitations to aviation traveler screening activities for novel influenza, many countries mounted broad screening efforts at their borders during pH1N1 19 nonetheless.",

For example, if a rapidly unfolding outbreak were taking place in Central America, it would make sense to anticipate higher need for public health resources focused on direct flights coming to the U.S. from high-volume contributors such as Managua and Guatemala City. Although other passengers from Central America may come to the U.S. via connecting flights, these travelers would be so low in number as to present minimal risk, and to expend resources to address them initially may divert from more effective efforts with the bulk of travelers arriving on direct flights at a few U.S. locations. Our analysis of 2009 flight data revealed that, by volume, the airports most affected by flights from Central This approach seems intuitive, but others have observed that this risk-based, targeted approach to bolstering surveillance and response capacities at key airports has been the exception rather than the norm, and that careful planning for public health response at key points of entry can be more effective than the usual first response of implementing travel restrictions. 13, 41, 47 In light of current global economic uncertainties and the overall decline of resources for public health in the U.S. and other countries, current planning and future point of entry interventions for global disease outbreaks must optimize the resources that are available, quickly and accurately assess risks and prioritize efforts to maximize impact of intervention efforts. 48 The \"node-to-node\" approach embodied in our model will allow public health officials to preserve resources for longer-term, community-based mitigation and prevention activities by targeting response to those points of entry likely to be affected earliest.",

Therefore, future modeling should consider how to maximize effectiveness of public health interventions while minimizing passenger delays and travel disruptions, by analyzing the efficacy and cost of specific interventions such as dispensing antivirals at points of entry, health questionnaires with real-time data entry using handheld devices, and fever detection using technology such as thermal imaging. Further analysis and reporting of worldwide government responses to the emergence of pH1N1 and other regional disease outbreaks would help to fill in some of the information gaps regarding point of entry interventions.",

This simulation tool can aid public health officials to assess risk and leverage resources efficiently via targeted and scalable border mitigation measures, especially at key U.S. airports that would be most expected to bear the initial brunt of an international outbreak.",
