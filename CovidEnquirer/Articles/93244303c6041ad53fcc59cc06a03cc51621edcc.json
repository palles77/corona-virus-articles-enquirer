Some of these can also infect related species as illustrated by the threatened extinction of gorillas by Ebola infection in west and central Africa. There are no safe and effective treatments available for these serious infections. In addition to the logistical difficulties inherent in developing a drug for infections that are sporadic and occur mainly in the third world, there is the overwhelming barrier of no hope for return on investment to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to address these unmet medical needs. Therefore, the National Institute of Allergy and infectious Disease (NIAID) has developed and supported a variety of programs and resources to provide assistance and lower the barrier for those who undertake these difficult challenges. The primary programs relevant to the development of therapies for severe viral infections are described and three case studies illustrate how they have been used.

In fact the idea that the identification of a safe and effective antiviral drug was by definition impossible, was scientific dogma for many years. This mistaken ideology was first brought into question by the discovery and development of amantadine for influenza and acyclovir as a treatment for herpes simplex. It was finally laid to rest with the emergence of HIV and the AIDS epidemic, and the astonishingly rapid accomplishment of the development of 25 drugs against five separate HIV viral targets. However the question remains as to why similar successes have not been enjoyed for the other RNA viruses that cause highly pathogenic infections.",

First, many of these viruses are endemic or emerge sporadically in parts of the world with inadequate public health resources. These circumstances usually correlate with a lack of economic incentive for the pharmaceutical industry. Secondly, many of the diseases they cause are rare which complicates the clinical evaluation of potential therapies. Most importantly, many of these infections cause high morbidity and/or mortality and therefore research on them requires access to high-level biological containment. Finally, the host response to infection may make a significant contribution to the pathology such that an antiviral monotherapy may not be sufficient for disease control.",

The main objective of this program is to facilitate the identification of antiviral agents with the potential for treatment of viral infections of public health importance, including those for newly emerging infections, and those that are a low priority for the pharmaceutical industry. The services are free for suppliers interested in submitting compounds to be evaluated for antiviral activity. In general, compounds are put through in vitro evaluations prior to the consideration of evaluation in relevant animal models. NIAID encourages academic and industrial investigators to take advantage of this program. Since the primary purpose of the program is to encourage successful product development, NIAID ensures that the compound supplier's intellectual property rights are protected. A properly executed Screening Agreement is required for both in vitro and in vivo evaluations under this program. The primary purpose of this agreement is to assure both that NIAID's use of the supplied compound is clearly defined and to protect the rights of the supplier. NIAID has developed a template agreement that can be modified with the assent of lawyers for both NIAID and the supplier.",

Due to limited resources, the NIAID does not support the frac-tionation of extracts, and the supplier must demonstrate the capability for such fractionation before extracts will be accepted into the program. Although exceptions are occasionally made, the chemical identity or characterization of compounds to be screened must be released to the NIAID staff manager who will keep this information confidential. This is necessary so that the same compounds are not screened repeatedly. All of the assays are replication based. The assays for influenza and SARS are also available in a high throughput format. The viruses available for screening under this program are: The compound sponsor generally receives the data back within 2 months. The information provided to the sponsor on the data sheet includes the median effective concentration (EC50) and the concentration that reduces cell viability by 50% (CC50).

The models currently include mouse and/or hamster models of biodefenserelated viruses such as Punta Toro, Pichinde, yellow fever, West Nile, influenza A (including avian H5N1), and Venezuelan and Western equine encephalitis viruses. Some of the biodefenserelated viral models serve as surrogates for their more hazardous counterparts such as Punta Toro as a surrogate for Rift Valley fever and Pichinde as a surrogate for Lassa fever. The program also includes less exotic pathogens such as mouse models of herpesviruses, mouse or rabbit models of papillomavirus, cotton rat models of paramyxoviruses, and mouse models of orthopoxviruses. In addition, the program offers a transgenic mouse model of hamster-scrapie (see detailed descriptions of the models on the website referenced below). The NIAID contract laboratories are staffed by established investigators who possess a strong antiviral research background and publication record in their respective animal models. Often there are several different models available for an individual pathogen and these may vary in method of virus inoculation or animal mortality.",

Endpoints can include clinical parameters such as mortality, weight and oxygen saturation, and laboratory values such as virus titers in various organs.

Criteria for prioritization include addressing an unmet medical need, having novel chemical or desirable pharmacokinetic characteristics, utilizing a novel therapeutic strategy and having pharmaceutical backing for further development. Often, the materials submitted to the in vivo testing program are those that were \"hits\" in the in vitro screening process. Exceptions to this include products that are anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory in nature. Such products would not be expected to manifest antiviral activity in vitro, so these products are considered by the NIAID for direct submission to the animal model program. After a product has been selected for testing, the compound sponsor, the NIAID contractor, and NIAID program staff work together to develop specific protocols to evaluate the product. The experiments are conducted in a stepwise fashion with continual involvement of the three parties. Rarely, a sponsor does not want to be involved in planning for each specific study. In those cases, NIAID staff and the animal model contractor will develop the plan and then discuss the results with the sponsor.",

Some examples of the reagents available through BEIR are bacteria, protists, rickettsia, viruses, fungi, cell lines, toxins, recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, SCM and nucleic acids (genomic material and cloned genes). These reagents are available free of charge to registered investigators. Acquisition of these reagents is one of the critically necessary and challenging tasks for BEIR. Therefore, investigators are highly encouraged to deposit reagents into BEIR to provide access/use of materials, relief from the burden of distributing reagents, and to provide secure storage of valuable reagents. In addition, BEIR has the capability of contracting for the preparation of specific reagents.

There are, however, more sophisticated toxicology studies also available, such as genotoxicity, reproductive toxicology and other studies that may entail specialized capabilities. Investigators may benefit from the synthesis of their candidate drugs and drug analogs in quantities sufficient for subsequent biological and biochemical analyses, and this can include radiolabeled compounds.

Moreover, there is the unthinkable threat of bioterrorism faced by our society today. In response to these emerging public health issues, NIAID preclinical programs have been able to rapidly establish antiviral assays and animal models in response (Barnard et al., 2004; Morrey et al., 2002; Noah et al., 2007; Severson et al., 2007; Smee et al., 2002) and to adjust the use of resources to address new needs. Although only two of the resources described have existed for more than 6 years, and many of the models relevant to biodefense are new as well, a few examples of how these resources have been used may help the reader understand how the NIAID can assist companies attempting to develop new drugs against severe viral infections.

In the contract laboratory at Utah State University, the principle investigator at that time, Dr. Robert Sidwell and colleagues discovered for the first time that T-705 was highly active in mice lethally infected with influenza A/Duck/MN/1525/81 (H5N1) . When administered per os 1-h post-virus exposure, once, twice, or four times daily, dosages from 30 to 300 mg/kg/day were well tolerated; each prevented death, lessened decline of arterial oxygen saturation and inhibited lung consolidation and lung virus titers. The four times per day treatments at 300 mg/kg/day were also found to be efficacious when treatment was delayed 96 h after virus exposure. Remarkably, single T-705 treatments administered up to 60 h after virus exposure prevented deaths and arterial oxygen saturation decline. Altogether, over 10 experiments were conducted for the Toyama Chemical Company on T-705 versus influenza in the mouse model. The preclinical efficacy data from these experiments were used to support Toyama's IND submissions in both Japan and the United States. Safety evaluations in humans began in Japan in January 2007, and in the U.S. shortly thereafter. The NIAID is continuing to support the investigation of T-705 in combination with other antivirals and in combination with substances which may have an effect on immune modulation or inflammation. In addition, recent work under the NIAID contract with Utah State University has shown that T-705 has activity in rodent models against viruses other than influenza, suggesting it may have broad-spectrum activity against a range of pathogenic RNA viruses (Gowen et al., 2007) .",
