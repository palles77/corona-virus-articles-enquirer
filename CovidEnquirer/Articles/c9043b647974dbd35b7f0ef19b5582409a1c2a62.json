Such general papers include data pertaining to prosimians (Kohn and Haines, 1982; Brockman et al., 1988; Feeser and White, 1992) , New World primates (Nelson et al., 1966; Chapman et al., 1973; Chalmers et al., 1983; Lehner, 1984; Richter, 1984; Tucker, 1984; Abee, 1985; Kalter, 1985; Montoya, 1990, 1992; Potkay, 1992; Valverde et al., 1993; Weller, 1994; Baer, 1994) , Old World primates (Keeling and Wolf, 1975; Kim and Kalter, 1975a; Schmidt, 1978; Ensley, 1981; Henrickson, 1984; Adang et al., 1987; Courtenay, 1988; Munson and Montali, 1990; Janssen, 1993) , or primates in general (Lapin and Yakovleva, 1963; Fiennes et al., 1972a Fiennes et al., , 1972b Martin, 1978; Benirschke, 1983; Griner, 1983; Padovan and Cantrell, 1983; Wallach and Boever, 1983; Schmidt et al., 1986; Lowenstine, 2003) . Tables 9.1 and 9.2 summarize the magnitude and support the importance of respiratory disease in nonhuman primates. Respiratory system structure itself is highly complex. It has evolved to meet a variety of physiologic demands in which the basic physical requirement is intimate contact between large volumes of air and blood, which brings with it a high potential for exposure to a myriad of potentially damaging agents carried in the air or blood. An understanding of general respiratory system structure, function, and disease, as well as associated diagnostic approaches and reported respiratory problems in nonhuman primates, is essential for any individual involved in primate medicine.",

Lamina proprial serous, mucus, and mixed tubuloalveolar glands contribute to nasal secretions. The paranasal sinuses are continuous with the nasal cavity and have similar mucosal lining as in the nasal cavity. The morphology and extent of the sinuses varies amoung species and between individuals within a species (Takahashi 1984; Preuschoft et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2010) . The nasopharynx is also supported by surrounding bony structures, with a submucosal layer of striated muscle and two layers of fascia. It is lined by RE, with zones of SE. Lymphoid nodules are present throughout the nasopharyngeal submucosa. The Eustachian (auditory) tubes extend from the nasopharynx to the middle ears and are similarly lined by RE. Laryngeal, tracheal, and bronchial patency is maintained by hyaline cartilage plates and rings. Spaces between the cartilages are made up of fibroelastic membranes, termed the annular tracheal ligament. The ends of incomplete tracheal rings are joined by smooth muscle, the trachealis. It is not unusual for tracheal ring ossification to occur in older animals. The laryngeal mucosa includes SE from the vestibule to the oral margin of the vocal cords, whereas the posterior lumen is lined by RE. Laryngeal diverticula, the air sacs, are lined by stratified cuboidal and ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The air sacs pass over the external surfaces of the trachea, thyroids, salivary glands, and skeletal muscle in the neck region (Figure 9 .1) and, in some species (orangutans (Pongo sp.) and gorillas (Gorilla sp.)), even extend over the clavicles and into the axillae (Figure 9 .2). In chimpanzees (Pan trogylodytes) the air sacs are described as being of unequal size (Swindler and Wood, 1982) . The air sac opening in monkeys is usually single, on the midline at the base of the epiglottis. In the apes, there are paired openings directed laterally from the lateral ventricles. The air sac adventitia is quite vascular and includes abundant adipose tissue, nerves, and sparce, flat bands of skeletal muscle. The function of the air sacs is uncertain, but they are thought by many to serve as a resonating or amplifying apparatus for phonation (de Boer, 2009 ). Another hypothesis is that they act as a \"rebreathing apparatus\" during phonation (Hewitt et al., 2002) .",

Inertial impaction occurs primarily in the nasal passages and pharynx at points of air stream change in direction and turbulence. Gravitational sedimentation and diffusion take place primarily in the lower respiratory system and are discussed later in relation to the vulnerability and formation of certain lesions in those areas. Virtually all particles greater than 10 mm in diameter are deposited above the nasopharynx, as are a large percentage of inhaled particles smaller than 10 mm. This deposition is associated with initial replication of many viral and bacterial agents in the upper respiratory epithelium and lymphoid tissue before they spread systemically or are redistributed into the lower respiratory tract after nebulization and inspiration.",

The mucociliary blanket moves toward the pharynx at a velocity of 5e15 mm/min. These secretions and deposited materials are subsequently cleared when they are swallowed after they reach the pharynx. When circumstances result in airway secretion volume that is greater than can be cleared by normal mucociliary clearance, coughing is an important mechanism that aids in the movement of this additional material. Well-developed lymphoid tissue in the tonsillar and dorsal nasopharyngeal regions provides the opportunity for immune response to the variety of antigens deposited there, but also provides a route for primary infection by organisms such as Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and Brucella spp. (Dungworth, 1993) . The transport and deposition of particles from the mucociliary blanket provide a mode of spread for diseases such as tuberculosis and a variety of helminth eggs and larvae.

Clara cells (nonciliated epithelial cells) have high cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity, which can activate a number of xenobiotic compounds into pulmonary toxins. Tracheobronchial epithelial cells metabolize arachidonic acid to eicosanoids, including prostaglandin E 2 and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), which may regulate local smooth muscle tone and vascular flow. Neutral endopeptidase is an enzymatic regulator of airway neuropeptides such as substance P and neurokinin A, which in turn can stimulate increased vascular permeability and airway smooth muscle contraction. Following injury and interaction with cytokines, bronchial epithelial cells can also upregulate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Intracellular adhesion molecule-1 promotes adhesion and migration of circulating neutrophils and monocytes into airways during an inflammatory reaction. Interferon is a nonspecific compound that can help limit local viral infection, whereas lysozyme and lactoferrin have selective antibacterial activity. The presence of pathogen-specific secretory IgA on the respiratory mucosa is one of the most important components of immunity to respiratory pathogens. Finally, normal bacterial flora in the nose and nasopharynx are important in that they specifically adhere to receptors on cilia and epithelial surfaces, preventing adherence and colonization by more virulent organisms.",

They are generally divided into multiple lobes on each side, with differences in lung lobation among the different primate groups (Parent, 1992; Scott, 1992b) . The right lung in prosimians, New World monkeys, and many Old World species has four lobes. A few prosimians and Cebidae have three right lobes as do the great apes, which lack the accessory (azygous) lobe. The left lung of smaller and more \"primitive\" species consists of two lobes, whereas the larger Old World species generally have three, and great apes generally have two. An interesting exception to this lobation is the orangutan, which has a single lung lobe on each side. An important anatomic variation of note is the right superior bronchus site of origin. In some species (e.g., orangutan and bonobo), it branches from the trachea proximal to the main tracheal bifurcation at the carina, increasing the possibility for accidental obstruction during tracheal intubation, leading to atelectasis of the right cranial lung lobe (Robinson and Janssen, 1980) . The bronchi progressively branch and decrease in diameter, eventually becoming bronchioles, the last generation of which is termed the terminal bronchiole. The branching airways are accompanied by a double arterial supply, the pulmonary and bronchial arteries. Bronchioles are distinguished from bronchi by the absence of cartilage and submucosal glands within their walls. Each terminal bronchiole opens to the functional unit for gas exchange, the acinus. An individual acinus includes respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, alveoli, and associated blood vessels.",

As lung volume increases, the radially arranged interalveolar septa pull on the bronchiolar wall, with a resulting maximal bronchiolar luminal diameter during maximum volume. This process is reversed with expiration, such that small bronchioles may collapse at low volume. Airflow out of the pulmonary acinus supplied by the collapsed bronchiole ceases without sufficient collateral ventilation. The thin walls, collapsibility, and small diameter of bronchioles make them much more susceptible than bronchi to pathologic processes occurring in the surrounding alveolar parenchyma. Similarly, inflammatory processes originating in bronchioles are likely to spread to adjacent alveoli. The small lumens increase the likelihood for bronchioles to become obstructed by inflammatory exudate. Although the resistance to airflow in individual bronchioles is high, the total cross-sectional area of all bronchiolar generations is considerably larger than that of the bronchi. Consequently, pathologic processes that affect small numbers of bronchioles can be clinically inapparent with regard to signs of airway obstruction.

Many of these are subsequently exhaled; however, droplet nuclei and other irritant or infectious particles approximately 1e2 mm in diameter tend to deposit at the bronchiolaralveolar junction. This phenomenon is associated with the sudden drop of the air stream linear velocity to zero at this point, due to the abrupt increase in the airspace crosssectional area. It is a major factor in the apparent vulnerability of the bronchiolar-alveolar junction to damage by inhaled irritant and viruses.",

Although phagocytosis can occur within a relatively short time (e.g., 4 h after alveolar deposition of bacteria), the physical removal of particulates from alveoli is inefficient compared to particles deposited on the mucociliary blanket. Depending on particle physical nature and irritant characteristics, it can take several days to months or longer for 50% clearance of particles. Macrophage-phagocytosed particles are either inactivated or sequestered as the macrophages move toward the bronchioles and onto the mucociliary blanket. If not phagocytized, particles within the alveoli tend to be cleared with the alveolar lining liquid as it moves centripetally to the bronchioles or it may penetrate the pulmonary interstitium. The latter tends to occur more with increased particulate load. Interstitial penetration is generally by endocytosis across alveolar type I epithelial cells. Particles within the interstitium are removed with lymph flow and are phagocytosed by interstitial macrophages. Peribronchiolar and perivascular clusters of particle-laden macrophages are associated with lymphatics, with some eventually moving to local lymph nodes.",

The pulmonary artery carries systemic venous blood to the pulmonary parenchyma for gaseous exchange in the alveolar capillaries. The pulmonary arteries generally run parallel to the bronchi and bronchioles, with a similar branching pattern. With their origin in the aorta, the bronchial arteries supply oxygenated blood to the airways and supporting pulmonary connective tissue, including the pulmonary artery vasa vasorum. Bronchial artery branches are closely associated with bronchial and bronchiolar walls. Venous drainage of the lungs occurs primarily through the pulmonary veins, with just a small amount of blood returning through the bronchial veins. Normal pulmonary and cardiac functions are closely interdependent. This is evident with the observation that cardiovascular diseases can result in impaired respiratory function in association with pulmonary edema and congestion, whereas chronic pulmonary diseases that interfere with pulmonary blood flow can affect normal heart function and systemic circulation causing \"cor pulmonale.\"",

Other emboli can include fragments of thrombi, helminth parasites for which the respiratory system is a natural or accidental habitat, and even parasitic ova. Rare emboli that may be found in the lung circulation include epidermal fragments and hair inadvertently introduced into the blood during injections or intervertebral disc nucleus pulposis fragments. This blood filter function of the pulmonary circulation can be both beneficial and a source for additional problems. The trapping of emboli serves to prevent them from reaching the systemic circulation and causing infarction in major organs such as heart, brain, and kidneys.

The physical examination should assess the animal in general, with particular emphasis on the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the cardiovascular system, as respiratory and cardiovascular disorders can frequently lead to similar signs. Elements of observation include the presence of discharges, deformities, or other lesions and the presence of sneezing or coughing. The breathing pattern character (rate and rhythm, effort during inspiration and expiration) and the intensity and quality of respiratory sounds (wheezing, crackles) are additional important factors to note. Features of importance regarding nasal discharge include discharge characteristics and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. Open mouth breathing in an otherwise calm, unstressed animal may be a sign of bilateral nasal obstruction, complete nasopharyngeal obstruction, or severe lower respiratory tract disease. Cyanosis occurs in severely affected animals. General systemic signs such as weight loss, anorexia, and depression can occur at the same time and may be the only sign(s). Hypoxia and acute hypercapnea can be associated with disturbances in mentation and even coma. Important aspects of the physical examination of animals with other evidence of nasal involvement include assessment of nasal airflow, and examination of nose, face, oral cavity, regional lymph nodes, and eyes. Airflow assessment techniques can include visually comparing the size of condensation formed by airflow out of either nostril onto a smooth cool surface such as a glass slide or ophthalmoscope base and/or listening to or feeling the airflow out of each nostril while the other one is occluded. The nasal, sinus, and oral regions should be palpated for evidence of distortion or swelling. Percussion and transillumination can be additional helpful techniques for the evaluation of possible sinus filling. A careful oral examination is essential for the assessment of possible nasal cavity problems. This would include examination of the hard palate (defects, swellings), soft palate (ventral depression associated with nasopharyngeal swelling), oral mucosa in general (trauma, erosions, ulcers, plaques, petechiae), palatine and glossal tonsils, teeth, and periodontia.

For nasal radiographs, such features as loss of symmetry, increase or decrease in nasal cavity density, bone abnormalities, and the presence of foreign bodies are some of the more frequently occurring changes with nasal disease. Tracheal radiographs are evaluated for variation in diameter and course. At times, contrast studies are needed in cases of suspected tracheal rupture or fracture or to help visualize suspected radiolucent foreign bodies.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide additional detail for skull internal structure in particular and are becoming more available at regional diagnostic facilities. Computed tomography can be particularly useful in determining the extent of an upper respiratory problem, including whether it has extended into epidural areas or the brain itself (Cambre, 1986) . Both CT and MRI can be used for studies of nasal and sinus lesions with good consensus between the two modalities (Drees et al., 2009 ). CT has proven useful for diagnosis of air sacculitis as well as sinusitis in orangutans (Steinmetz and Zimmerman, 2011) . For thoracic imaging, CT is useful for characterizing pleural disease (e.g., differentiating fluid from tumor); with contrast injections, differentiating tissue masses from vascular structures; and identifying small parenchymal nodules. Lewinsohn et al. (2006) describe the usefulness of CT imaging in conjunction with IFN-g ELISPOT testing (see below) for accurately assessing the extent and progression of TB in individual rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to provide fine definition of mediastinal and pleural lesions. Early use of these highly sensitive techniques is somewhat compromised because little base line information is available to indicate how many \"normal\" individuals have small, previously undetected parenchymal lesions. Also, it is not yet known how to differentiate the specific types of lesions (e.g., inflammatory or neoplastic). Pulmonary scintigraphy provides the opportunity to further differentiate and locate various disease processes (e.g., inflammation, neoplasia) using radionucleotides with affinity for certain cells types (Karesh et al., 1990) .",

Intradermal tuberculosis skin testing using mammalian old tuberculin (MOT) is commonly used in nonhuman primates as an important part of preventive medicine programs (Henrickson, 1984; Southers and Ford, 1995; Kramer et al., 2011 ) (see also under tuberculosis). Tuberculin testing of nonhuman primates provides a good example of the potential variability in sensitivity and specificity when performing skin tests in general (Chaparas et al., 1975; Kaufmann and Anderson, 1978; Kuhn and Selin, 1978; McLaughlin and Marrs, 1978; Janssen et al., 1989; Dillehay and Huerkamp, 1990; Wells et al., 1990) . As with skin testing antigens, a number of potentially useful serologic tests have been developed that include a variety of respiratory pathogens. Using appropriate serologic tests can help avoid the use of more extensive/invasive diagnostic procedures. Sensitivity, specificity, and the specific types of available serologic tests (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), agar gel immunodiffusion, indirect immunofluorescence, latex agglutination) vary within institutions, however, requiring close interaction with the responsible laboratory for test result interpretation. With regard to TB diagnostics, recent new techniques (Lin et al., 2008) , including interferon gamma releasing assays (Desem and Jones, 1998; Vervenne et al., 2004) , lymphocyte activation assays (Parsons et al., 2009) , and serologic assays (Khan et al., 2008) are being developed. These assays are generally best used in addition to the tuberculin skin test as part of a comprehensive response to apparent positive tuberculin skin tests within designated animal populations.",

For anterior rhinoscopy, a variety of equipment can be used, from an otoscope to a rigid pediatric arthroscope to a flexible fiberoptic endoscope (FOE). Flexible fiberoptic technology has tremendously improved the ability to perform these procedures (Strumpf et al., 1979; Muggenburg et al., 1982; Moser, 1994; McKiernan, 1995) . The flexible FOE is composed of fiberoptic bundles that provide both illumination and visualization pathways. One or more small channels traverse the FOE, through which instruments can be passed, fluids delivered, and suction applied with retrieval of cells for cytology (Tate et al., 2004 ). An FOE is most useful for posterior rhinoscopy, although a dental mirror may provide some visualization of the nasopharynx. The major contraindication for endoscopic examination, particularly in the lower respiratory system, is lack of experience, which both reduces the diagnostic and therapeutic potential and increases the risks (e.g., hypoxia, laryngospasm, and bronchospasm, pneumothorax, and biopsy-associated hemorrhage). Thomas et al. (2006) describe the use of human nasal cannulas during bronchoscopy procedures as an aid in maintaining adequate oxygen delivery in pig-tailed macaques.",

Retrieval of BAL fluid and cells can be improved by use of a 70-cm section of sterile tubing between the biopsy channel port and the 25-cc syringe used for aspiration (Singletary et al., 2008) . Thoracentesis should be performed to sample pleural fluid for all pleural effusions of uncertain etiology and can be indicated for relief of effusion-associated symptoms as well (Dysko and Hoskins, 1995) .",

For nasal cavity lesions (McKiernan, 1995) , these can include the use of plastic catheters (e.g., shortened urinary catheters) cut to a sharp tip to obtain a core samples, endoscopic cup forceps used to obtain a pinch biopsy, or more invasive procedures such as nasal and sinus trephination or rhinotomy. For lung biopsy, both closed and open approaches are used. Closed biopsies are obtained via a fiberoptic endoscope (transbronchial) or a percutaneous cutting needle. Using an FOE provides the opportunity for multiple biopsies in one procedure; however, care must be taken when sampling close to the pleural surface. Even though performed with fluoroscopic or CT guidance, cutting needle techniques have a relatively high potential for complications due to pneumothorax and/ or bleeding. Open lung biopsy approaches include thoracotomy and, to a lesser extent, thoracoscopic techniques. These procedures are relatively safe and allow direct visualization of the optimum biopsy site and the opportunity to obtain a sample of adequate size. All specimens obtained via biopsy should be processed for pathologic examination and should be cultured and or collected appropriately for molecular diagnostics (see above). Imprint cytology from biopsy material can be useful in the diagnosis of neoplastic and some infections (e.g., Penicillium, Cryptococcus, Herpesvirus). Final diagnosis should, nevertheless, generally be based on histopathologic findings.

Differential absorption of the two light wavelengths by oxygenated and nonoxygenated hemoglobin allows calculation of the percent of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen. It is important to be aware of certain issues when interpreting pulse oximetry data (Weinberger and Drazen, 1994) . First, the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve becomes flat above arterial PaO 2 60 mmHg (corresponding to an SaO 2 \u00bc 90%), such that the oximeter is relatively insensitive to changes in PaO 2 above this level. The curve position and relationship between PaO 2 and SaO 2 can also change in relation to temperature, pH, and the erythrocyte concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG). Second, low tissue perfusion can make the oximeter signal less reliable or even unobtainable. Third, the two wavelengths of light do not detect other forms of hemoglobin, such as carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, such that SaO 2 determined by the pulse oximeter in the presence of significant amounts of either of these hemoglobin forms is unreliable. Finally, the often-used goal of SaO 2 ! 90% does not reflect CO 2 elimination and thus does not ensure that PaCO 2 levels are clinically acceptable.",

Postmortem examination of the lungs can include varying degrees of complexity (Tyler et al., 1985) depending on the diagnostic and/or research needs. The presence of discrete lesions, characteristics of airway mucus coat, and the presence of airway edema or hemorrhage should be noted, as well as the characteristics of the lung parenchyma (color and consistency, including the presence of consolidation, atelectasis, or scarring). Tissue may be taken for microbial studies. Removal of the lungs prior to fixation is important for overall assessment and sampling of the unfixed tissue, including microbiology sample selection. Tyler et al. (1985) describe a variety of fixatives and fixation techniques for lungs, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This includes a discussion of fixation by immersion versus intratracheal infusion versus vascular perfusion fixation via the pulmonary artery. Neutral buffered 10% formalin is the standard fixative for light microscopic assessment; however, some newer formalinfree preservatives provide for good histologic detail while better protecting and preserving antigens and nucleic acids for immunohistochemistry and molecular detection of pathogens (see above). For electron microscopy, a variety of other fixatives are more suitable, generally containing paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or mixtures of the two with phosphate or cacodylate buffer (e.g., Karnovsky's fixative). Fixation of tissue slices by immersion generally provides adequate samples for the assessment of microscopic morphology. Infusion of fixative via the airways provides for the rapid fixation of larger volumes of tissue, and the expanded air spaces allow for the easier interpretation of lesion orientation and alveolar epithelial and interstitial changes. Tracheal perfusion fixation disadvantages include the possibility that cellular exudates and inhaled particles may be translocated to other areas in the lung during the infusion process. With generalized disease processes, the use of immersion fixation of lung slices for some samples, combined with inflation via airways for other lobes, can provide a good compromise.",

The report of pollinosis in Japanese macaques (Sakaguchi et al., 1992) describes specific serum IgE to allergens from Japanese cedar trees and refers to reports indicating pollinosis in both wild and captive Japanese macaques throughout Japan. The tested monkeys had clinical signs of sneezing, rhinorrhea, pruritus, and epiphora. The chimpanzee had a long history of upper respiratory tract allergic disease, first confirmed and treated after a 12-year history of clinical signs. Seasonal (March through fall) signs included nasal discharge, impacted nares, open mouth breathing, facial swelling, bilateral epiphora, and an occasional cough. Annual tuberculin tests were negative, and previous hematology, serum chemistry, throat cultures, and thoracic radiographs had no significant abnormalities. A variety of antibiotic regimes produced equivocal results. Initial symptomatic treatment with prednisolone, followed by use of the oral antihistamine terfenadine, 60 mg twice daily, reduced the severity of upper respiratory disease. Both intradermal skin testing and serum IgE (IgE FAST-plus \u00d4 : fluorescent allergosorbent test) allergy tests indicated specific allergies to a number of species of local trees and grasses. Signs recurred within five years, with increased severity and persistence. Switching to a second antihistamine, loratidine, 10 mg orally once a day, produced only a temporary response. A purulent nasal discharge initially improved with oral cephalexin, 500 mg b.i.d., but then recurred and was unresponsive to an additional antibiotic regimen. Further workup at that time revealed the presence of multiple bilateral nasal polyps. These polyps, plus purulent material and plant fibers resembling hay, were removed from the nasal cavities.",

Edema associated with nasal mucosal inflammation contributes to the potential conditions for sinusitis by impeding sinus secretion outflow. Mucocele is a condition in which mucous secretions accumulate without bacterial invasion. When the accumulated material is purulent exudate, the condition is termed sinus empyema. The associated bacterial flora in empyema usually consists of normal mixed oral microflora. Fungi cause particularly severe forms of chronic sinusitis, such as mucormycosis, which is particularly prevalent in individuals with diabetes. Sinusitis often is clinically inapparent unless it has caused facial deformity or a fistula in the overlying skin. The sinus proximity to the brain carries with it increased potential for severe complications, including local osteomyelitis and spread into the cranium and brain. Sinusitis treatment is directed at the primary disease cause (e.g., tooth root abscess, foreign body) and associated infection when present (antibiotics, antifungal therapy) but may also require surgical curettage and drainage.",

One report (Olson and Palotay, 1983 ) also noted supraorbital palpebral bullae associated with cellulitis, whereas another (Van de Woude and Luzarraga, 1991) included wheezing. In all three reported outbreaks, Branhamella catarrhalis (currently classified as Morexella catarrhalis, and formerly Neisseria catarrhalis) was isolated from a number of animals. The report by Van de Woude and Luzarraga (1991) included transmission studies that supported the role of B. catarrhalis as an upper respiratory pathogen in cynomolgus macaques causing a syndrome similar to the previously reported bloody-nose syndrome. Antibiotic therapy (penicillin) in that report resulted in diminished clinical signs within 24 hours, although it was noted that some b-lactamase-resistant strains have been recorded in the human literature. Other factors thought to contribute to the severity of clinical disease include concurrent viral or bacterial disease, stress (e.g., recent transport), and/or low humidity. Although no apparent human infection was noted among animal care staff in any of the three reports, M. catarrhalis is a recognized human respiratory and otic pathogen, supporting the potential for zoonotic and anthropozoonotic transmission of this organism (Murphy and Parameswaran, 2009) . In a similar note, human M. catarrhalis-associated disease has comparable fall/winter seasonality as noted in reports of bloody-nose syndrome in macaques. In a more recent study it was found that M. catarrhalis could be cultured from 1/5 healthy rhesus macaques and was isolated from 33/33 with bloody-nose syndrome (Bowers et al., 2002) .

Often there is initial acute, severe, paroxysmal nonproductive coughing or respiratory distress. If the initial period of coughing and respiratory distress is missed, a relatively long period of time may pass, during which an occasional cough or slight wheezing may be apparent. At some point, relatively nonspecific systemic signs may occur, including fever, anorexia, depression, and weight loss, which are generally associated with the presence of pneumonia. Radiography of the thorax and neck may reveal soft tissue or mineral density, but this is relatively uncommon. With time, an inflammatory tissue response, including localized bronchial or parenchymal densities, may become more apparent. Definitive diagnosis is generally made with bronchoscopy. If animals with recurrent pneumonia are examined with radiography early after antibiotic initiation and within one week of completion of treatment, focal radiodense areas may indicate the lodging site of the foreign body. Plant derived (e.g., grass awn) foreign bodies can be particularly troublesome due to difficulty in detection and their potential for migration. Tissue migration can lead to such complications as bronchopulmonary abscess, pneumothorax, pyothorax, discospondylitis, or signs due to penetration of other organs. Treatment consists of foreign body removal and appropriate antibiotic therapy for secondary bacterial infection. Bronchoscopic removal is generally preferred, although a surgical approach may be necessary in some cases. Marcella and Wright (1985) reported on the intratracheal presence of a 1 \u00c2 1 cm rock in an adult female rhesus monkey. The animal presented with an occasional dry, nonproductive cough that had increased in frequency over a 2-week period. Radiographs revealed an irregularly shaped radiodense object at the tracheal bifurcation. Using a flexible bronchoscope, the object was identified as a triangular, wedge-shaped rock and removed. Coughing decreased immediately after the procedure and ceased one week after bronchoscopy.",

Neonates with palatine defects commonly have trouble nursing, show nasal regurgitation, and are susceptible to secondary bacterial or fungal rhinitis and aspiration pneumonia.

Nasopharyngeal tumors of various kinds have been described, with epithelial tumors occurring most frequently. Of particular note is the apparent propensity for nasal, nasopharyngeal, and oral carcinoma in marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) (Baskerville et al., 1984; Betton, 1984; Mclntosh et al., 1985) . This high rate of occurrence has been suspected to be associated with an underlying oncogenic virus infection, as occurs in EpsteineBarr virus (EBV) associated nasopharyngeal carcinomas of humans. McIntosh et al. (1985) looked for, but were unable to detect, EBVantibodies in their study. The initial presentation of these animals is facial swelling, with or without nasal discharge, and visual impairment. These signs are relatively common in marmosets, usually related to abscesses of the upper canines, but, at least in marmosets, nasal carcinoma is also important to keep high on the differential diagnostic list. These tumors have a high potential for pulmonary metastasis.",

The bonnet macaque presented with unilateral left lower eyelid swelling, epiphora, and nasal discharge. The Taiwanese macaque presented with left maxilla swelling. Biopsy was used for diagnosis in both animals. The tumor recurred after attempted surgical excision in the Taiwanese macaque. Both animals were euthanized. In each case, pulmonary metastasis had occurred. Based on radiographic monitoring of the Taiwanese macaque, metastasis was a late development, with metastatic nodules not detected until one year after the initial diagnosis was made. In a more recent review of neoplasia in cynomolgus macaques, a single case of exophytic nasal adenoma was diagnosed, but no further details were given (Kaspereit et al., 2007) .",

Infection severity and time course, as well as primate species (and air sac anatomy), are important variables in the choice and effectiveness of the treatment technique. Systemic antibiotics alone or in combination with simple exudate aspiration are not effective in the treatment of even simple air sac infection. The presence of secondary pulmonary infection is an important indication for systemic antibiotic use. A 1-to 2-week period of repeated closed irrigation and drainage with saline, followed each time with local antibiotic instillation, can be effective for mild infection. Gross (1978) describes the effectiveness of surgical air sac ablation in a baboon. This is much more difficult, if not impossible, in great apes, in which the air sacs extend into the axillary region and, in male orangutans, even around the mandible toward the ears and cheeks. Severe or persistent infections require open drainage. Successful control of chronic, progressive air sac infection in animals has been achieved using intermittent reevaluation, drainage, and antibiotic therapy in some animals and surgical intervention creating a transient stoma or permanent air sac marsupialization in others (Strobert and Swenson, 1979; Hill et al., 2001) . Chronic air sac marsupialization prevents extensive exudate accumulation, but chronic aspiration of small amounts of exudate can continue, leading to chronic pulmonary infection or immune complex glomerulonephritis. Brown and Swenson (1995) and McManamon et al. (1994) briefly describe a promising technique to eliminate the occurrence of secondary pneumonia in orangutans with chronic or recurrent airsacculitis through surgical closure of the paired ostia between the larynx and air sacs.",

This generalized bronchoconstriction results in the clinical hallmarks of asthma, including dyspnea, coughing, and wheezing. A less common presentation of asthma involves intermittent episodes of nonproductive cough or exertional dyspnea. Most asthmatics are asymptomatic between attacks; however, a subset of individuals with chronic disease may develop emphysema, chronic bronchitis or pneumonia, or cor pulmonale and heart failure. A classification for asthma generally includes two basic types: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic asthma is associated with a type I hypersensitivity reaction induced by exposure to an extrinsic antigen. Subclassification of extrinsic asthma includes atopic asthma, which is precipitated by specific allergens; \"occupational\" asthma, which is precipitated by exposure to chemicals; and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which is associated with the Aspergillus colonization of airways followed by development of Aspergillus-specific IgE. Intrinsic asthma is associated with such precipitating factors as respiratory tract infection and inhaled irritants. All types of asthma may be precipitated by cold, stress, or exercise, and patients with one form may also be likely to experience asthma associated with another form.",

In human medicine, reversible airway obstruction is determined by measuring the 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ), with reversible airway obstruction defined as a 15% or greater increase in FEV 1 following two puffs of a b-adrenergic agonist. Increased airway responsiveness can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased airway responsiveness to challenge with histamine, methacholine, or isocapnic hyperventilation of cold air. In veterinary medicine, techniques to test lung compliance and resistance are being used experimentally for the assessment of airway obstruction in a variety of conditions (King and Hendricks, 1995) . For allergyassociated asthma, nonspecific tests that support the possibility of hypersensitivity include blood eosinophil count and quantitative serum IgE levels, as well as skin testing and serum IgE (IgE FAST-plus \u00d4 : fluorescent allergosorbent test (3M Diagnostics)) tests for various specific antigens.

            "text": "The presence of extensive neonatal atelectasis is a feature of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD). The fundamental defect in RDS is a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant, often associated with inadequate surfactant production by type II epithelial cells due to fetal immaturity (pre-term births) or to more specific metabolic derangement of their surfactant synthesis, such as might occur with fetal hypothyroidism and, possibly, hypoadrenocorticism. The high levels of insulin in diabetic mothers can counteract the effects of endogenous corticosteroids, which are particularly important for the induction of surfactant formation in the fetal lung, resulting in a higher risk for RDS in the infants of diabetic mothers. Other factors can contribute to RDS, such as fetal asphyxia, decreased pulmonary arterial blood flow, amniotic fluid aspiration, and inhibition of surfactant by fibrinogen, other edema fluid constituents, or components in aspirated amniotic fluid, particularly meconium. An additional contributing factor comes with the need for oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation in these patients. High concentrations of oxygen for prolonged periods can cause toxic pulmonary changes. In particular, mechanical ventilation and oxygen toxicity can give rise to a subacute or chronic condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Fetal and neonatal atelectasis, as well as RDS, are reported as causes of perinatal and neonatal death in infant Macaca nemistrina (Morton et al., 1979) . Primates also provide experimental models of RDS (HMD) and BPD Escobedo et al., 1982; Hessler et al., 1985; Coalson, 1988) , as well as meconium aspiration as a cause of RDS (Block et al., 1981; Carey, 1988) .

The animal was found dead. A saddle thrombus was present at the initial bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, with complete occlusion of the left pulmonary artery. Microscopic examination revealed generalized pulmonary arteriosclerosis, with intimal and medial thickening (endothelial hyperplasia, subendothelial fibrosis, and medial smooth muscle hyperplasia). Cause and pathogenesis for this condition were not determined. A similar case has been reported by Ulland (1968) .

In addition to diffuse pulmonary damage, secondary compromising of pulmonary surfactant also generally occurs. The complexity of ARDS, pathophysiology contrasts with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, in which the primary problem involves inadequate pulmonary surfactant production associated with lung immaturity, along with the highly compliant nature of the infant chest wall. Despite the variety of potential causes, ARDS, clinical characteristics, pathophysiologic derangement, and general supportive measures are similar. Untreated ARDS is almost uniformly fatal. With the current level of treatment, prognosis is still poor, with mortality in humans of 50e60%. Treatment includes mechanical ventilatory support and identification and treatment of the primary problem. For sepsis-associated ARDS, identification of the source of infection and responsible organism(s) is necessary. Treatment of the pulmonary injury focused on the variety of possible bacterial products, and factors involved in the injury and inflammatory process have been proposed and are subjects of clinical trials, but no single clear-cut strategy exists. These strategies include use of such things as antibodies to endotoxin and a variety of chemokines, as well as the administration of exogenous surfactant and judicious use of corticosteroids.

Three routes for thoracic invasion of microbial agents include (1) hematogenous or lymphatic; (2) spread from an adjacent structure, e.g., severely affected lung, ruptured esophagus, or mediastinitis; or (3) direct introduction via penetrating trauma, foreign bodies, thoracentesis, or surgery. An example of the second route has been reported for an African green monkey (Chlorocebus sp.) (Stills and Rader, 1982) .

Nonhuman primates are also susceptible to many of these infections, although only in the apes, and especially the chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes and P. paniscus), are colds a common and regular problem. Much of the work on the natural history of simian respiratory viral infections dates from the 1960s and 1970s, although nonhuman primates are still used as animal models in the study of influenza and the newly described human metapneumovirus. Many viruses can affect both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In the lungs they tend to cause a bronchointerstitial pneumonia in which the initial attack causes widespread damage to the terminal bronchioles and alveolar ducts. Bronchiolitis obliterans, in which there is fibrous repair and occlusion of bronchioles by fibrous plugs, is a potential, but rare, sequela to viral infections or other insults (e.g. toxins, aspirated gastric content) to this location (Aguerre et al., 2010) .",

RSV has also been detected during respiratory disease outbreaks in free-ranging, human habituated chimpanzees (Kondgen et al., 2008) . Whether the virus was of human or chimpanzee origin has not been fully established. Other great apes (Gorilla gorilla gorilla, G. Gorilla beringi, Pongo pygmaeus, Pongo abelii, and Pan paniscus) are also often seropositive, but the association with clinical disease is uncertain.",

In one outbreak in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) there was high morbidity (69/91) with lower mortality (10/69) (Flecknell et al., 1983; Sutherland et al., 1986) . Clinical presentation included upper respiratory signs of mild serous, or occasionally purulent, nasal exudate or systemic illness and death. In animals that died or were euthanized, the main finding was diffuse pulmonary consolidation and edema with histologic evidence of acute interstitial pneumonia. Histopathologic lesions were not well described.

Gastrointestinal disease or immunosuppression, rather than respiratory disease, are often the most important sequelae to the infection, however, \"giant cell interstitial pneumonia\" also occurs and can be fatal.

Squirrel monkeys are one of the animal models of choice for vaccine and therapeutic studies (Renegar, 1992) ; they and capuchins have also been used for pathogenesis studies. In capuchins, the severity of disease varied with the route of inoculation (intratracheal more severe than intranasal) and strain of virus (A/Victoria/3/75 more pathogenic than A/New Jersey/76). The incubation period was 3e5 days, although virus could be recovered on day 1. Clinical signs included depression and dyspnea in the worst cases, and rhinorrhea in the less severely affected animals. Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was more evident on lateral than anterioreposterior projections and was most evident in middle and lower (caudal) lobes. Pathologic findings in animals killed at days 4 to 6 included gross evidence of tracheal hyperemia and patchy pulmonary consolidation. Histologically there was a loss of ciliated cells, erosion, hemorrhage, and mononuclear inflammation in tracheal and bronchial epithelium accompanied by squamous metaplasia. Extension into the parenchyma was characterized by thickening of alveolar septa by mononuclear cells and exudation of fibrin. Upper respiratory lesions were limited by mild submucosal inflammation (Grizzard et al., 1978) .",

Morbidity was 50% and about 50% of affected animals died. Grossly the lungs were consolidated, and foci of hemorrhage were observed. There was also splenomegaly and hepatomegaly with multifocal necrosis. Histologic lesions were those of a hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonia. Inclusion bodies were seen in the livers. The virus was subsequently determined to be Herpesvirus simiae. Periodic epizootics of herpesvirus infections were seen subsequent to the original report and respiratory disease was often a manifestation, although oral ulcers and encephalitis were seen as well. In retrospect, this colony of bonnet monkeys was found to have an endemic simian type D retrovirus infection (SRV-1), which may have allowed for recrudescence and severe manifestion of the herpesvirus infection. This contention is corroborated by a report of fatal herpesviral bronchopneumonia in two elderly female bonnet monkeys, which had been severly stressed by the introduction of an aggressive male to the group (Scharf et al., 2008) .",

Intratracheal inoculation produced systemic disease with viremia and a vesicular rash in African green monkeys. Pulmonary lesions included edema and petechial hemorrhages have been described.

In 2002, a severe respiratory disease outbreak occurred in human primates, beginning in China and spreading via air travel to other Asian countries, Canada, and Europe, causing international concern and panic (reviewed by Nagata et al., 2010) . The infection was traced to masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in a live animal market, and several other species in the market were found to be positive including raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Other studies, however, showed that, although the virus has a broad host range, the most likely natural hosts of the SARSCoV are bats of the genus Rhinolophus. Although spontaneous nonhuman primate cases have not been reported, SARS is included in this chapter because cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, African green monkeys, and common marmosets can be infected experimentally and serve as important animal models (Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006) . In affected humans, severe interstitial pneumonia progresses to ARDS. The presenced of multinucleated viral-induced syncytial cells is a hallmark. Adults and elderly are more severly affected than children with a case fatality rate approaching 10%.

In addition, the continued global human health threat caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Corbett et al., 2003) is the stimulus for multiple, continuing studies using nonhuman primate models of tuberculosis. These studies are part of worldwide efforts to better characterize infection-related immunological response in order to establish improved diagnostics and possible effective vaccines Vervenne et al., 2004; Lewinsohn et al., 2006) . Although most notably a problem among Old World primates, it occurs naturally in New World monkeys as well (Hessler and Moreland, 1968; Leathers and Hamm, 1976; Alfonso et al., 2003) . Prosimians are also susceptible. The disease is generally associated with infection by the organisms Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis (Hessler and Moreland, 1968; Renner and Bartholomew, 1974; Thoen et al., 1977; Kaufmann and Anderson, 1978; McLaughlin, 1978; Tarara et al., 1985; Ward et al., 1985; Wolf et al., 1988; Keet et al., 1996; Martino et al., 2007; Panarella and Bimes, 2010) ; however, a number of other Mycobacterium species have occasionally been reported in association with clinical pulmonary disease (King, 1993b; Chege et al., 2008) . Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is also recognized in nonhuman primates, usually associated with agents belonging to the Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, but also reported in association with M. paratuberculosis. Surveillance and diagnostic techniques for tuberculosis are important preventive health procedures for captive primate colonies (Kaufmann and Anderson, 1978; Kuhn and Selin, 1978; McLaughlin and Marrs, 1978; Renquist and Whitney, 1978; Montali and Hirschel, 1990; Southers and Ford, 1995; Desem and Jones, 1998; Kahn, et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008; Parsons et al., 2009; Kramer et al., 2011) . Interpretation of surveillance results can vary for individual animals, depending on the state of disease or Mycobacterium exposure, and has been a particular problem with orangutans (Chaparas et al., 1975; Kaufmann and Anderson, 1978; Kuhn and Selin, 1978; McLaughlin and Marrs, 1978; Calle et al., 1989; Dillehay and Huerkamp, 1990; Wells et al., 1990) . For orangutans, a high rate of positive tuberculin reaction (60% of those tuberculin tested) generally has been associated with exposure to a variety of nontuberculous Mycobacterium species, including M. fortuitum, M. terrae, M. nonchromogenicum, M. avium, and M. cheloni (Calle et al., 1989; Wells et al., 1990) , with no evidence of mycobacterial disease.",

Culture of these organisms requires special media and techniques to destroy contaminating nonacid-fast bacteria. Tuberculosis is extremely rare in natural populations of nonhuman primates that are remotely situated away from human populations. Infection in captive populations is generally thought to be related to the transmission of disease from humans to animals (Cappucci et al., 1972) . Tuberculosis is a particularly contagious and potentially fulminant disease in macaques, especially in rhesus monkeys (King, 1993b; Walsh, et al., 1996) . Differences in clinical course, lesions, and disease pathogenesis between rhesus monkeys and cynomolgus monkeys have been recognized and compared with regard to potential models of human tuberculosis (Walsh et al., 1996; Langermans et al., 2001; Capuano et al., 2003) . Rhesus monkeys are reported to develop fulminant disease even in low-dose experimental infection, while with lowdose experimental infection, cynomolgus monkeys tend to show a disease spectrum, including chronic, slowly progressive disease and even chronic clinically inapparent infection. Strict quarantine procedures and routine tuberculin testing of nonhuman primates and animal care personnel have contributed to a marked reduction in the occurrence of tuberculosis in captive nonhuman primate populations.",

Disease pathogenesis, reviewed by Dannenberg (1978) and King (1993b) , involves phagocytosis of organisms by tissue-resident macrophages. Variability in macrophage ability to kill the organisms exists, leading to diverse possibilities for infection outcome and lesion morphology. When organisms are able to survive phagocytosis and replicate intracellularly, the macrophage is eventually killed. Successful intracellular killing of mycobacteria by macrophages leads to processing of the agent and antigen presentation for immune response by T lymphocytes. The T cells, as well as peripheral blood monocytes, are recruited to the infection site by various macrophage-derived cytokines. Further activation of mononuclear phagocytes occurs in these sites in response to mycobacterial products and cytokines released by the reactive lymphocytes. The activated macrophages phagocytize the bacteria and tend to transform into immobile epitheliod cells, forming epithelioid granulomas. A subset of macrophages remains mobile and may eventually move to regional lymph nodes and other tissues, where, if intracellular killing has not been complete, the infection and associated inflammatory response continue. Additional processes that contribute to the classical morphology of tuberculous lesions include fusion of macrophages to form multinucleate Langhanstype giant cells and promotion of potentially encapsulating fibrosis by various mediators.",

Among the most commonly affected organs are lungs, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney, intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes.",

Early lesions may be widely scattered microscopic granulomas made up of circumscribed collections of epithelioid cells and an occasional Langhans' giant cell. Some of these lesions may include central neutrophil aggregates. Such small lesions may initially be confined to lung or intestinal tract, in association with the initial route of infection. The tubercle is the \"classic\" lesion of advanced tuberculosis. It includes a central core of acellular necrotic debris, surrounded by a zone of epithelioid cells and scattered Langhans-type, multinucleate, giant cells. At times the core is calcified. The tubercle periphery is generally made up of variable amounts of fibrous connective tissue and infiltrating lymphocytes. Acid-fast special stains can reveal acid-fast bacilli in the epithelioid and multinucleate giant cells, although in some cases many tissue sections must be examined to find tubercle bacilli (paucimicrobial infection).",

Definitive diagnosis relies on identification of a specific mycobacterial species from the lesions, using isolation and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Speciation by PCR can be performed on isolates and on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues (Ghossien et al., 1992) . In the absence of culture or PCR, the presence of acid-fast bacilli in granulomas or tubercles in microscopic sections only confirms the diagnosis of a mycobacteriosis. Among the lesions assessed for differential diagnosis, those caused by Nocardia can be confused, particularly because of the partial acid-fast nature of Nocardia; however, Nocardia organisms stain Gram positive and are beaded and branching, making differentiation relatively easy.",

All animal movement within the colony should be halted, and animals previously housed in the same room with the infected animal(s) should be located. These animals should be tested biweekly with intradermal mammalian old tuberculin (MOT) for a minimum of five consecutive negative tests. This is necessary because detecting infected animals early post-infection can be difficult. The nature of the intradermal tuberculin skin test, which measures delayed-type hypersensitivity, is not sensitive under conditions of recent infection and generally does not become positive until at least a short time after the infected animal has begun to shed organisms (Clarke, 1968; Henrickson, 1984) . In addition, other possibly immunesuppressive circumstances can produce anergy, leading to false-negative results, e.g., recent (within four weeks) immunization with modified live virus measles vaccine (Staley et al., 1995; Panarella and Bimes, 2010) . Panarella and Bimes (2010) also discuss variables that can modify the sensitivity of intrapalpebral skin testing for tuberculosis, including the following important points: (1) sedation allowed for increased ability to find positive reactors through closer examination and palpation (animals with scores of one to three on the standard five-point scale);",

This latter point is based on review of facility practices in the described outbreak which showed that TB test injections had been being placed in the middle of the eyelid, leading to the authors' speculation that mild swelling may have been more difficult to detect than if the tuberculin was placed at the eyelid edge. Under certain circumstances, abdominal intradermal skin testing has been performed in conjunction with or rather than intrapalpebral skin testing. Capuano et al. (2003) report that results with abdominal intradermal testing were among monkeys and did not necessarily correlate with the concurrently administered palpebral test and remark that primate health care personnel should reconsider the use of this technique as part of a confirmatory follow up to positive intrapalpebral testing. Recent new techniques Lin et al., 2008) , including interferon gamma releasing assays (Desem and Jones, 1998; Jones, 1998; Vervenne et al., 2004) , lymphocyte activation assays (Parsons et al., 2009) , and serology assays (Khan, et al., 2008) , are being developed.

Severe infections can lead to pneumococcal bacteremia. Similarly, it has been reported to cause up to 95% of pneumonia cases in one report of nonhuman primate respiratory disease (Fiennes and Dzhikidze, 1972) ; however, S. pneumoniae does not appear to be part of the normal flora of nonhuman primates. In rhesus, after experimental inoculation, S. pneumoniae can be recovered for a maximum of 11 days. In the face of concurrent inoculation with influenza virus, S. pneumoniae persists for up to 99 days (Berendt et al., 1974) . These data suggest that S. pneumoniae in nonhuman primates is anthropozoonotic.

In humans it is an unusual part of pharyngeal and oral microflora, but is recognized in up to 20% of hospital patients. Pneumonia in K. pneumoniae infections is generally a bronchopneumonia, with a tendency for abscess formation and pleuritis. Septicemic pneumonia secondary to enteritis (pneumo-enteritis complex) also occurs. The exudate associated with Klebsiella is typically gelatinous, especially in infections with hypermucoviscosity strains. In hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Gram-stained sections, the organism has a characteristic evenly spread distribution and a thick clear capsule. Inflammation in Klebsiella pneumonia may be histiocytic as well as suppurative due to inhibition of neutrophil influx by capsular mucopolysacchrides. Although often associated with acute pneumonia, this may be followed by persistent, chronic infection, including chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary abscesses. Hypermucoviscosity strains are recognized as an emerging casue of community-acquired pneumonias in humans along with a syndrome of liver abscesses. This phenotype may be more virulent. Pneumonia and pleuritis associated with similar strains have been reported in sea lions (Jang et al., 2010) . In nonhuman primates invasive hypermucoviscosity phenotype Klebsiella pneumoniae has been reported as a cause of systemic disease consisting of abdominal, pulmonary, and/or cerebral abscesses in a laboratory colony of African green monkeys (Twenhafel et al., 2008) , but not as a primarily pneumonic syndrome.",

Eichberg (1985) reported an outbreak of K. pneumoniae infection in a group of nursery-housed infant chimpanzees. The disease began with nasal discharge. Two animals died, including one that had no recognized signs of clinical illness. The first animal that died had congestion, fever, anorexia, and weight loss along with the nasal discharge. Treatment with tetracycline was unsuccessful. Postmortem lesions in this animal were restricted to the lungs, including consolidation and pleural adhesions. Microscopic lesions were of diffuse severe bronchopneumonia. Gross lesions in the second animal included multifocal subepicardial hemorrhage and mild pulmonary edema, with scattered multifocal yellowgray lesions in all lobes and scattered subpleural petechiae. Histologic examination revealed lesions compatible with septicemia, including moderate to severe pneumonia. Culture in each case yielded pure cultures of K. pneumoniae, for which gentamycin was the drug of choice. Other animals were treated with gentamycin and the disease was rapidly cleared. Based on findings that many normal adult chimpanzees had positive throat and rectal cultures for K. pneumoniae, it was presumed that very young chimpanzees were immunologically compromised and at risk for clinical disease. Following this outbreak, strict husbandry and nursery management procedures were instituted, including restricted access, routine sanitation procedures for equipment and nursery enclosures, and use of protective clothing by nursery caretakers. Fox and Rohovsky (1975) present two cases of K. pneumonia infection in rhesus monkeys. The animals were involved in experimental work that included use of an atherogenic diet. Each case had meningitis, one had severe bronchopneumonia, and the other's lesions were compatible with septicemia, including pneumonia. Other reports of K. pneumonia in nonhuman primates were reviewed, and the occurrence of high mortality and frequent multiple drug resistance in the isolated organisms was discussed. Rapid identification and antibiotic sensitivity are keys for successful treatment in K. pneumonia outbreaks. Klebsiella has been identified as a cause of airsacculitis in owl monkeys (Giles et al., 1974) and in mixed infections in orangutan airsacculitis (see above). Vaccination reduced mortality in owl monkey infants due to Klebsiella \"pneumo-entereitis complex\" and septicemia from 20% per annum to 4% (Obaldia, 1991) .",

Cough was not recognized, and animals often remained bright and alert, with occasional signs of dyspnea when handled. Affected animals had mild fever. Over a 3-month period, 16 animals died out of a colony of 156 animals. Fifteen of the deaths occurred in animals less than 12 months old, whereas the other death occurred in a 5-year-old animal. Deaths occurred suddenly, with typical gross lesions consisting of pneumonia and pleuritis and two animals with pericarditis. Microscopic lung lesions were coalescing acute purulent bronchopneumonia. Animals were treated with oxytetracycline, with clinical recovery in adults after several days. Despite clinical recovery, B. bronchiseptica was still present in the nasopharynx of these animals eight weeks later. Nasal cultures of the entire colony yielded positive cultures for B. bronchiseptica in 71 of the 156 animals. Because of the fulminant nature of the disease in the young animals, initiation of treatment was too late to prevent mortalities. Graves (1970) reported the occurrence of fatal B. bronchiseptica pneumonia in a group of six African green monkeys (vervets, Chlorocebus aethiops) over a 6month period after the arrival of a total of 25 animals.

The organism has a strong tropism for bronchial epithelial brush border, to which it attaches and grows in tangled colonies without tissue invasion (McAdam and Sharpe, 2005) . The characteristic lesions and signs (enhanced cough reflex, peripheral lymphocytosis, malaise, weight loss, mild fever) are thought to be related to exotoxin production. These signs persist as long as the toxin is present within cells, even after the bacteria are gone. Immune protection and recovery are based on the production of secretory IgA, which inhibits bacterial adhesion and subsequent proliferation. The disease has a 7e10-day incubation period, at the end of which there is a \"catarrhal\" period of coughing and sneezing, followed by the onset of the characteristic violent paroxysmal coughing. Occasional complicating problems include subcutaneous emphysema and convulsions associated with hypoxia and constant coughing. Lesions of established whooping cough are of laryngotracheobronchitis. In severe cases this can include bronchial mucosal erosion, hyperemia, and copious mucopurulent exudate. Mucosal lymph follicles and peribronchial lymph nodes are enlarged and hypercellular, paralleling the marked peripheral lymphocytosis seen in complete blood count data. Immunization has traditionally been provided as part of the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccination; however, complications in both humans and in at least one infant chimpanzee (Southers and Ford, 1995) associated with the pertussis component have raised a cautionary note to the routine use of DPT. ADT vaccine is now available and could be considered as an alternative in conjunction with policies regarding immunization for employees and that prevent potential contact with children.",

The agent is distributed throughout the temporate Northern Hemisphere and is endemic in parts of North America, Europe, and Asia (Thomas and Schaffner, 2010) . Carried by rabbits and rodents, it is therefore most often reported in outdoorhoused nonhuman primates in zoos and vivaria. The agent can also be spread by insect vectors (flies and ticks), by direct contact or wound contamination with infected tissues or blood, and by inhalation or ingestion of infected exudates and contaminated water. In humans, there are several disease manifestations: (1) ulceroglandular, affecting skin with regional lymphadenitis; (2) oropharyngeal; (3) glandular; (4) pulmonic; (5) typhoidal (enteric); (6) occuloglandular and; (7) septicemic/ systemic. Nonhuman primate infections have been reported in prosimians, New World and Old World monkeys, and apes, and most have been presumed to be due to ingestion of an infected small mammal (M\u00e4tz-Rensing et al., 2007; Ketz-Reily et al., 2009; Lowenstine, unpublished) . Most reported infections were septicemic, but pneumonic cases have occurred as either part of systemic disease or due to presumed inhalation (Figure 9 .11). Rhesus have been used as a model for pneumonic tularemia, which is considered to be a potential agent of bioterrorism (Schriker et al., 1972) . Pulmonary lesions can vary from bronchopneumonia to interstitial and can range from predominantly histiocytic, to pyogranulomatous to necrotizing and suppurative. Organisms are difficult to identify with H&E and tissue Gram stains and are best demonstrated by culture, immunohistochemistry or PCR. Treatment consisting of doxycycline at 5 mg/kg, intravenously followed by treatment p.o., was successful in the orangutan cases (Ketz-Reily et al., 2009 ).",

Antimicrobial testing for Nocardia species may not be clinically relevant, such that choice of effective antibiotic should generally be based on published clinical experience. Recommended treatment most often includes the use of long-term sulfonamide or minocycline. In addition to sulfonamides and minocycline, most aminoglycosides, fusidic acid, and some newly developed lactam antibiotics are active against most Nocardia strains (Filice, 1994) .

Gross lesions included extensive chronic pneumonia and pleuritis, as well as air sac infection. Microscopic lesions were similar to those generally described with nocardiosis, including the presence of occasional granules made up of bacteria. Brown and Brenn stains revealed Gram-positive, branched filamentous organisms. These were acid-fast-negative with a variety of acid-fast stains, leading to an initial diagnosis of actinomycosis. Microbiology resulted in culture of Nocardia asteroides.",

            "text": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonias in children and adults in the U.S. and is also the cause of \"military recruit,\" \"primary atypical,\" and \"walking\" pneumonias . The only known natural host is the human primate, but this organism is also suspected to cause pneumonia in nonhuman primates including Old World monkeys and apes, and has been demonstrated experimentally to infect macaques and chimpanzees, which are used for studies of pathogenicity and vaccine development. Like all mycoplasmas, M. pneumoniae is a small, Gram-negative organism that lacks a cell wall and is placed in the class Mollicutes. It is both an extracellular and facultative intracellular parasite. Transmission is by respiratory droplets and inhalation after which the organisms attach to the upper and lower respiratory mucosa causing pharyngiti, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. Attachment to the ciliated border of respiratory epithelium, via a specialized attachment organelle, can lead to altered ciliary movement and deciliation. Cell cytotoxicity is due to production of hydrogen peroxide by the organism. Grossly lesions consist of patchy lobar, unilateral, or bilateral consolidation. Histologically there is mixed inflammation and mucosal edema with erosions in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles; in the lungs it is centered on respiratory bronchioles and alveolar septa causing thickening and exudation of protein rich edema and inflammatory cells (macrophages and lymphocytes with fewer plasma cells and neutrophils) . The lesions are similar to those seen in viral respiratory infections and resemble a localized ARDS lesion, complete with hyaline membranes (see above). Indeed M. pneumoniae infection may precipitate full-blown ARDS and can occur concurrently with respiratory viral infections and predispose to other secondary bacterial pneumonias. Much of the damage caused by M. pneumoniae is due to host immune response and cytokine release. Diagnosis in humans is often made by assumption, and definitive diagnosis by culture can be difficult due to the finicky nature of the organism and its slow growth rate in vitro. Evidence of seroconversion has also been used. Sputum Gram stains are negative, which helps rule out pneumococcal pneumonia. Molecular (PCR) detection, directed toward the organism or as part of a multiplex or \"gene-chip\" approach, is increasingly being adopted for definitive diagnosis. Treatment with tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, erythromycin) is usually effective, though resistant strains have been reported. Protective immunity is short-lived and recurrent or recrudescent episodes of mycoplasma respiratory disease can occur.",

There was no transmission between infected and control animals, although the organism persisted in infected rhesus for up to 50 days. Chimpanzees are the animal model of choice and are preferable to rodent models because they develop clinical signs that mimic the disease in humans, including rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, persistent cough, fever, and radiographic lung lesions (Barile et al., 1987 (Barile et al., , 1993 . Infection was by direct instillation into a main bronchus; however, two control chimps became accidentally infected suggesting that horizontal transmission may occur in this species. The agent could be recovered for 28e68 days from the oropharynx, similar to findings in humans. Positive serology was noted in wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) during a suspected measles respiratory disease outbreak . It is likely that this infection is under-diagnosed in nonhuman primates and it will be interesting to see if the application of \"gene-chip\" molecular diagnostics will help increase our understanding of the role of M. pneumoniae in nonhuman primate respiratory disesase (Benson et al., 2008) .",

They naturally infect a variety of wild rodent species (Pappagianis, 1985) , and high concentrations of the fungus may be found in rodent burrows. Vegetative growth occurs in these areas after rains, with dispersion of spores (arthroconidia) by the wind after the soil dries. Other activity that disturbs the contaminated soil, such as construction or agricultural, also can increase the possibility of spreading the infective spores. Very severe dust storms have resulted in epizootics of disease, and cases may occur in areas geographically associated with, but not normally recognized as, endemic sites of C. immitis/posadasii growth, as the windblown spores are carried miles away from their original source.",

It is not transmitted via the respiratory route from animal to animal. The tissue form is not generally considered to be pathogenic, although ingestion of infected mouse cadavers by other mice, rats, or hamsters has produced infection (Pappagianis, 1985) . Occasional human cases with sporulation in tissues antemortem have been documented. These latter findings support the use of appropriate precautions when handling diagnostic or postmortem material to avoid parenteral exposure or aerosolization and possible inhalation. Over time, it is likely that many animals and humans in endemic areas are exposed and possibly infected, with relatively few clinically apparent cases. When present, clinical signs in those with pulmonary disease may include fever and cough, and in humans have been noted to include pleuritic pain and hypersensitivity-type skin lesions (erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme). In a small percentage of individuals, more generalized disease occurs, with signs such as continued fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, and weight loss. Diagnostic workup can include radiology , as well as serology, biopsy, and culture or molecular detection of the organism (Pappagianis, 1985; Sauabolle, 2007) . Treatment involves the use of antimycotic agents, such as amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole (Graybill et al., 1985 (Graybill et al., , 1990 Pappagianis, 1985; Ampel 2010) and posaconazole (Herrin et al., 2005) .

When disseminated disease is present, there is more diffuse pulmonary involvement, with multifocal involvement of other tissues, including lymph nodes, spleen, bones, liver, meninges, and adrenals. The host inflammatory reaction depends on the phase of the organism that is present. Inflammation in acute and fulminant lesions includes a marked neutrophilic response, which generally occurs in response to arthroconidia and endospores. A granulomatous reaction takes place in response to the presence of the classical tissue-phase stage of C. immitis growth; the thickwalled spherule (sporangium), which measures 10e70 mm in diameter and has a thick, double-contoured wall. Endospores are produced in large numbers within the spherules and generally are 2e5 mm in diameter. They are released into the tissues when a spherule ruptures. The presence of all phases of fungal growth within an infection site can lead to a lesion morphology that includes foci of neutrophilic aggregation in association with endospores, as well as extensive fibrosis with epithelioid cells, giant cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, often in association with spherules. When infection is well contained by the host, the granulomatous response predominates and numbers of organisms are small, making detection and etiologic diagnosis more difficult.",

In each reported case, as well as in more recent reports (Burton et al., 1986; Graybill et al., 1990; Bellini et al., 1991; Johnson et al., 1998) , the affected animals either resided in endemic areas or had originated from endemic areas. Review of great ape mortality in North American zoos identified gorillas as being very susceptible to disease (Benirschke and Adams 1980; L.J. Lowenstine, unpublished) . The report by Burton et al. (1986) describes coccidioidomycosis in a ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) that had been relocated to a zoo in Oklahoma from a zoo in Phoenix. The initial clinical presentation of that animal was unilateral corneal opacity, followed three months later by convulsions, urine retention, and diarrhea. Within a week the condition of the animal continued to deteriorate, with dyspnea and radiologically apparent pleural effusion. Exploratory laparotomy revealed peritonitis as well, and the animal was subsequently euthanized. Pathological workup revealed the presence of multifocal granulomatous inflammation in multiple tissues including the retina, lungs, liver, kidney, and chest wall associated with thick-walled spherules compatible with C. immitis infection. Culture and serology confirmed the diagnosis. Graybill et al. (1990) document the occurrence of coccidioidomycosis in a free-ranging group of more than 200 Japanese macaques (M. fuscata) in Dilley, Texas. The report further deals with the use of fluconazole in efforts to treat animals with coccidioidomycosis. Four gravely ill monkeys died within one month of starting treatment, whereas eight animals showed rapid improvement with an oral regimen of approximately 2e3 mg/kg/day, given as caramel candy into which the drug had been mixed. Therapy was successful when given over a prolonged period of time (minimum of 13 months in this group); however, at the time of publication, only one animal in this group of eight had actually had treatment discontinued without a recurrence of clinical disease. Two animals that had therapy interrupted at two months relapsed but showed improvement again after resumption of therapy. The deaths of two other monkeys that had initially responded to therapy were directly related to a temporary interruption of the fluconazole supply. The authors discuss the potential benefit of higher doses and provide a review that includes initially mixed results in human trials. Finally, they reference earlier work that demonstrated great effectiveness of a liposomal preparation of amphotericin B, which could be administered just once or twice weekly and produced remission in treated animals (Graybill et al., 1985) , but which could not be used in the field situation in which the free-ranging macaques were involved.",

Histoplasmosis occurs generally by ingestion or inhalation of contaminated dust, which is often associated with pigeon, chicken, or bat feces-contaminated areas. Histoplasma exists in the infected individual as an intracellular parasite of the monocytemacrophage system, with subsequent potential for dissemination throughout the reticuloendothelial system. Diagnosis can be made with a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test or by morphologic identification in affected tissue specimens with confirmation by culture or molecular diagnostics. Treatment is as for other systemic mycotic infections.",

Systemic histoplasmosis occurred in a de Brazza's monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus) in Kenya (Frank, 1968) , with extensive renal involvement and less affected liver and lungs. This was presumably due to Histoplasma duboiseii the causative agent of African histoplasmosis, which has also been identified as causing locally invasive cutaneous and osteolytic lesions in imported baboons housed in a colony in Texas (Butler and Hubbard, 1991) . Bergeland et al. (1970) report a squirrel monkey with Histoplasma-associated granulomatous pneumonia, hepatitis, and splenitis. The animal died two months after being purchased from a Minneapolis pet shop. Disseminated histoplasmosis has also been reported as an opportunistic infection in an SIVinfected rhesus monkey (Baskin, 1991a) .",

Cryptococcosis due to C. neoformans generally occurs as an opportunistic primary respiratory infection via inhalation, more often affecting the nasal passages than the lungs. The pulmonary infection frequently remains mild or subclinical while the fungus spreads to other organs, including the central nervous system, skin, liver, spleen, adrenals, and bones. Meningitis is a very common complication in human cases. In humans the disease usually occurs as an opportunistic infection, but infection in normal individuals also occurs, often in association with overwhelming exposure. C. gattii is more often associated with pulmonary cryptococcosis and occurs in immunologically competent individuals (Dewar and Kelly, 2008) . This species of Cryptococcus was initially described in Australia and tropical countries, but has expanded its range to the west coast of Canada and the U.S. in recent years, as evidenced by cases in humans, domestic animals, and freeranging and captive wild animals (Byrnes et al., 2010) .",

The radiographic appearance and microscopic morphology can vary depending on the immune function of the host (Feigin, 1983; McAdam and Sharpe 2005) . In immunocompromised patients, gelatinous fungal masses may exist with minimal to no inflammation. Inflammatory infiltrates even in immune competent patients may often contain relatively few cells, consisting of a mixture of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, although granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid and giant cells occurs as well, particularly in lung lesions. In section and cytologic specimens, the yeast has a characteristic very wide capsule. The capsule remains unstained in H&E-stained sections and stains positively with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), mucicarmine, or alcian blue. Use of India ink in cytologic specimens is a negative staining technique that reveals the distinctive thick capsule as a clear halo around the yeast.",

            "text": "Pneumocystis spp. are important opportunistic respiratory pathogens, the environmental sources of which are as yet unknown. Analysis of ribosomal RNA gene sequences, mitochondrial proteins, major enzymes (thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase), and cell wall components (include glucans) provides evidence that Pneumocystis is a fungus rather than its previous classification as a protozoan (Stringer, 2002) . In humans, the agent formerly known as P. carinii has been renamed P. jirovecii and is considered to be highly species specific. Pneumocystis isolated from nonhuman primates are still considered to be P. carinii. Though further speciation is likely, in one study, no nonhuman primates were found to be infected with P. jirovecii (Demanche et al., 2001; Guillot et al., 2004) . Most normal children are seropositive to Pneumocystis by the time they are 3 to 4 years old. P. jirovecii pneumonia occurs in premature or malnourished infants, children with primary immunodeficiency diseases, patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and people with AIDS. Epidemiologic and experimental data support the occurrence of airborne, possibly horizontal transmission in humans and animals, including nonhuman primates (Vogel et al., 1993; Demanche et al., 2005) . There is debate about whether Pneumocystis can be transmitted vertically in humans, and there is one mention of twin stillborn common marmosets with the infection (Demanche et al., 2003) . Clinical signs associated with pneumocystis pneumonia in humans and nonhuman primates include dyspnea, fever, anorexia, and nonproductive cough (Chandler et al., 1976; Pyrgos et al., 2009; Catherinot et al., 2010) . Radiographic findings often include bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates (\"white-out\"). Because the clinical and radiographic findings are nonspecific, etiologic diagnosis depends on identification of the organism itself. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the key material for testing and the organisms are generally made apparent using such traditional stains as methenamine silver, toluidine blue, or cresyl echt violet, which stain the cell wall. Specific immunostaining or molecular probe techniques (PCR) are also available. Grossly, affected lungs fail to collapse and are regionally pale pink to tan with a firm styrofoam-like consistency similar to the appearance of SIV giant cell pneumonia (Figure 9 .12). Rarely, a nodular form with extension to extrapulmonary pleural surfaces is seen (Yanai et al., 1999) . The typical microscopic lesion is a diffuse or patchy pneumonia. Alveolar spaces contain variable amounts of amphophilic, foamy amorphous material that resembles proteinaceous edema fluid, but which is composed of Pneumocystis and cellular debris as demonstrated by electronmicroscopy (Baskerville et al., 1991) . Variable degrees of interstitial thickening are often present due to edema, minimal to mild mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates, and fibrosis. Neutrophils are present early in the course of experimental infection and true granulomatous pneumonia is rare, but can be seen (Board et al., 2003; Hartel et al., 2010) . Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia may also be present. Organisms can be identified in histological sections using the stains mentioned above and by immunohistochemistry (Baskerville et al., 1991) .",

Pentamidine is frequently used but is more toxic than TMPeSMX. Other drugs used for second-line treatment include clindamycin and primaquine or dapsone and trimethoprim, which are administered orally. These drugs are as effective as pentamidine, with much lower toxicity (Helweg-Larsen et al., 2009) .",

Carriage rates among 83 individuals of 26 species of zoo-housed primates were examined using postmortem lung tissue and were determined to be 28.6% in New World species and 20.0% in Old World monkeys (Demanche et al., 2003) . A serologic survey comparing wild vs. laboratory-born Japanese and cynomolgus macaques in Japan revealed that exposure/ infection was much higher in those animals brought in from the wild (54.9% of wild cynomolgus and 40% of Japanese monkeys vs. 9.4% of lab-born cynos) (Fujita et al., 1996) . Other reports include endemic infection in a \"marmoset\" colony (Saguinus spp.) (Richter et al., 1978) , infection in two aged owl monkeys (A. trivirgatus) and two young chimpanzees (Chandler et al., 1976) , infection in cynomolgus and Japanese macaques (Matsumoto et al., 1987; Demanche et al., 2003 Demanche et al., , 2005 Kling et al., 2009) , and in redbellied tamarins (Saguinus labiatus) . Although no systematic study of gibbons or great apes has been conducted, mild histological lesions of pneumocystosis were identified in a zoo-housed gorilla infant (L.J. Lowenstine, unpublished) . Richter et al. (1978) describe a retrospective survey of lungs from 441 callithricids (Saguinus spp.) for the occurrence of Pneumocystis. Fifty of the animals had histologically detected Pneumocystis, with just two animals that were thought to have associated clinical disease. The most-affected age groups were the 7e12-month group and aged animals (approximately 4 years plus). In the report by Chandler et al. (1976) , one of the owl monkeys had no concurrent disease, whereas the other had been experimentally inoculated with Treponema pallidum 44 months before death. The chimpanzees in the same report each had an underlying myeloproliferative malignant neoplasm (erythroleukemia; McClure et al., 1974) . A retrospective survey of macaque necropsies by Matsumoto et al. (1987) revealed low rates (7.7%) of Pneumocystis in Japanese macaques (M. fuscata), 4 out of 52; crab-eating macaques (M. fascicularis), 1 out of 13; and none detected among 35 rhesus monkeys. All of the affected animals were relatively young (four juveniles, 7 to 22 months, and one young adult). Of the infected macaques, just two of the Japanese monkeys were thought to have clinically significant Pneumocystis infection; one was 16 months old and the other apparently an infant (body weight listed at 490 g).",

Furuta et al. (1993) found Pneumocystis pneumonia in three of five SIV-infected rhesus monkeys and suggest that this represents reactivation of latent Pneumocystis infection.

Clinically significant P. carinii infection increased from zero in the first two years of SIV infection to >50% during the fourth year of virus infection. Epidemiologic data, in this report, strongly supported the horizontal transmission of Pneumocystis as opposed to reactivation of latent infection.

The only known definitive hosts are members of the cat family (Felidae). Intermediate hosts include essentially all other warm-blooded animals, including nonhuman primates. Sexual reproduction of the parasite takes place in the intestinal tract of the felid and unsporulated oocysts are shed in the feces. Sporulation takes place in the environment, and it is the sporulated oocytes that are infectious. Intermediate and definitive hosts become infected by ingesting the sporulated oocytes or by ingesting an infected definitive or intermediate host in which tissue cysts (bradyzoites) are present. Transplacental infection is an important cause of fetal death in humans and has been demonstrated experimentally in macaques (Schoondermark- Van de Ven et al., 1993) .

In New World monkeys, especially the cebids such as squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sp.) (Anderson and McClure, 1982; Cunningham et al., 1992) , capuchins (Cebus sp.), and woolly monkeys (Lagothrix sp.), toxoplasmosis is manifest as severe respiratory distress or as sudden death. Animals may be found acutely moribund with audible rales and fluid, blood, or foam coming from the nares and mouth (Epiphanio et al., 2003) . There may be nonspecific premonitory signs of anorexia and lethargy. Diarrhea may also be present and occasionally is the main presenting sign (Bouer et al., 1999) . In Old World monkeys, the infection is often self-limiting, inapparent, and may be seen in the context of immune suppression (Lowenstine et al., 1992) . Tissue cysts without inflammation are an occasional incidental finding in macaques and apes, but encephalitis may ensue in immune-suppressed animals.",

The oval, translucent cysts contain a single invaginated scolex with four suckers. The cysts have been found in the abdominal and thoracic cavities, muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and central nervous system. Viable cysts generally have little or no associated host reaction, although clinical problems may be associated with the space-occupying effect of the cyst. Inflammation occurs in association with cyst death. Diagnosis depends on finding the characteristic bladder-shaped structure in the tissues, with species identification based on the scolex hook size and structure. Wolff et al. (1989) report the presence of cysticercus pneumonitis and pleuritis in a red-ruffed lemur. The condition was initially recognized with full-body radiographs taken during quarantine screening procedures. A mineralized density and a soft tissue density were recognized in the left ventrocaudal thorax and left dorsocaudal lung, respectively. Exploratory thoracotomy revealed an extrapleural bilobed firm mass in the left ventral pleural space, attached via fibrous adhesions to the left caudal lung lobe, and a 1.0-cm encapsulated nodule within the dorsal margin of the left caudal lung lobe. These were excised. An intact cysticercus with armed scolex and a larval remnant with associated mixed inflammation (eosinophils, plasma cells, neutrophils) were found by microscopic examination of the pulmonary nodule. The extrapleural mass contained degenerate remnants of calcified larval cestodes and fibrinous exudate. The animal recovered uneventfully and was later released from quarantine. Severe disseminated cystocercosis was also reported in a zoo-housed black lemur in which one lung was obliterated by multiple cystacerci associated with atelectasis, edema, and moderate mixed inflammation (Dyer and Grieve, 1998) . The organisms were identified as Cysticercus longicollis, the larval form of the canine tapeworm Taenia crassiceps.",

Adult Echinococcus sp. are parasitic in the small intestine of canids. The larval stage has been found in a wide variety of species, including various wild and domestic herbivores, as well as nonhuman primates and humans. Hydatid cysts are large, and unilocular (E. granulosus) or multilocular (E. multilocularis). The cyst wall inner layer is composed of germinal epithelium from which multiple brood capsules develop. Multiple scolices develop from the wall of each brood capsule. Hydatid cysts may be located in the abdominal cavity, liver, lungs, subcutis, or brain, or disseminated throughout the body. Death due to anaphylactic shock has been reported associated with hydatid cyst rupture. Free scolices from ruptured cysts will produce additional cysts that may implant locally or spread systemically by lymphatics. Diagnosis of hydatid disease includes imaging studies, e.g., radiology or ultrasonography, as well as serological tests such as the Casoni intradermal skin test, indirect hemagglutination, or western blotting (Goldberg et al., 1991; Sato et al., 2005) .

The condition was discovered using thoracic radiography during quarantine screening, which revealed multiple fluid-filled cysts in the thoracic cavity. The animal was clinically normal, with normal hematology and serum biochemistry profiles. Indirect hemagglutination testing for Echinococcus was negative, a finding that occurs in approximately 50% of human patients with isolated pulmonary Echinococcus lesions. The animal was euthanized due to the interference the lesions would have in the intended research study, and necropsy confirmed the presence of Echinococcus granulosus cysts on the pleural surface of the left caudal and right middle lung lobes. Although treatment was not carried out with this animal, the report discusses the potential therapeutic approaches in similar cases, which include the use of chemotherapy and/or surgery. Generally, surgical procedures involving resection, enucleation, or evacuation of echinococcal cysts are the recommended treatments for human disease. During such surgery, scolicidal agents (e.g., silver nitrate, hypertonic saline) have been injected into the cyst to help reduce the risks of accidental spillage of cysts and the subsequent spread of the condition. Promising chemotherapeutic approaches involve the use of benzimidazole carbamate compounds (e.g., albendazole) over extended periods Santivanez and Garcia 2010) .",

Adult Mesocestoides infect various bird species and domestic and wild mammalian carnivores. The larvae, or tetrathyridia, have been found in the coelom or peritoneum of vertebrates, including snakes, lizards, mice, dogs, and cats, as well as in nonhuman primates which serve as secondary intermediate hosts. The primary intermediate hosts are invertebrates such as ants and orbatid mites. Guillot and Green (1992) report the presence of multiple Mesocestoides sp. tetrathyridia-like larvae in the lungs of a cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) that died due to respiratory arrest within several hours following recovery from a surgical procedure. The animal had been apparently clinically healthy up to the time it died. Multiple 1-to 3-mm-diameter cysts were recognized in all lung lobes during necropsy. Two other case of pleural and pulmonary mesocestoidiasis have been reported, one in a wild-caught pig-tailed macaque which was euthanized because of experimental SIV and the other in a long-term captive, wild-caught, female vervet monkey (Fincham et al., 1995; Sasseville et al., 1996) . In both cases, chronic pleural fibrosis was associated with either encysted (in the macaque) or free tetrathyridia. In the macaque, there were multiple opaque grayish cysts encasing whole tetrathyridia and yellow solid nodules consisting of fibrous capsules with varying amounts of granulomatous inflammation. In both cases the infection was considered to be incidental.",

Seventeen days before the surgery the animal had been treated with ivermectin for gastrointestinal parasites prior to quarantine release. Gross necropsy findings included patchy raised areas of pulmonary hemorrhage and consolidation. Filarioid nematodes (Edesonfilaria malayensis) were present in pulmonary blood vessels and in multifocal cysts on visceral and parietal pleural surfaces, as well as in the urinary bladder wall. Microscopically, there was verminous vasculitis, pulmonary infarcts, and pneumonia. The condition of the parasites themselves was compatible with parasite death due to the earlier drug treatment. The report postulates that parasitic emboli led to pulmonary infarction and severe inflammation and that this condition contributed to death following anesthesia due to pulmonary function compromise. Zhang et al. (1990) describe a case of fatal enterobiasis in a 5-year-old chimpanzee from the Qingdao Zoo in China. The animal became clinically ill, with anorexia and diarrhea. Fecal examination noted erythrocytes and inflammatory cells, and the animal was treated with ampicillin, dexamethasone, and other unnamed drugs over a 14-day period, at which time it died. Numerous pinworms were noted in the bloody stool before death. Death was associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. In addition to extremely large numbers of pinworms (Enterobius sp.) in the colon, which also contained multifocal ulcers to which worms were attached, pinworms were found microscopically in the mesenteric lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels, hepatic veins, and pulmonary vessels.",

The culprit is the human parasite Strongyloides stercorialis, which differs from the similar parasites of New World (S. cebus) and Old World (S. fulleborni) monkeys in that only S. stercorialis causes internal reinfection (autoinfection) and extremely large parasite burdens (hyperinfection). The life cycle is complicated, involving alternate parasitic and free-living generations but no intermediate hosts. Parasitic females reproduce only female eggs by parthenogenesis in the duodenmum and upper jejunum. Sexual differentiation of larvae is regulated by extrinsic factors. The eggs hatch in the host large intestine to rhabdidoid larvae and may be passed out in the feces or stay in the lower intestine. Development through two molts to the infective third stage filariform larvae may occur in the ground or in the host (autoinfection). Larvae excreted in feces alernatively develop into free-living male and female sexual stages producing rhabdidiform larvae, which may perpetuate the free-living population or may develop into infectious filariform larvae. The filariform larvae can penetrate the colon (in autoinfection) or the skin of a new host. They migrate via the venous circulation or lymphatics to the heart and then to the lung capillary bed where they molt to postfilariform fourth stage larvae and break out into the alveoli. They move up the respiratory tract to the larynx amd pharynx and are swallowed. They burrow into the mucosa of the upper intestines develop into adult females and the cycle begins again.",

The immature leeches hatch out and remain at the pond surface, gaining entry through the host oral or nasal cavity as the host drinks. The leeches attach to the upper respiratory tract mucosa (nasal passages, nasopharynx, larynx) and suck blood for a period of a few days to many weeks.

Recognition and identification of the parasite in its typical anatomic location within the host are the bases for diagnosis. Treatment (Stookey and Moe, 1978) involves removal of the leeches. In military dogs in southeast Asia, nasopharyngeal leech infestation was a significant problem. These animals were treated by flushing the nares with 15e20% alcohol while under anesthesia, with an endotracheal tube in place. The flushing continued until all of the leeches were detached and washed out into the oral cavity.",

The lesions are present throughout the lung parenchyma (Figure 9 .15). They have a small central lumen, which often contains one or more mites. Fibrinous or fibrous adhesions are often present between visceral and parietal pleura. Microscopically, the lesions consist of dilated, thickened bronchioles (chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis) with epithelial erosion or ulceration, often with sections of mite within the lumen, and with a surrounding zone of mixed inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages). The macrophages frequently contain characteristic birefringent crystalline golden brown to black pigment. The pigment is thought to be a product of the mite (Andrade and Marchevsky, 2007). The pathology of lung mite infection in baboons and chimpanzees is similar to that described for the rhesus monkey (McClure and Guilloud, 1971; Kim and Kalter, 1975a, 1975b) .",
