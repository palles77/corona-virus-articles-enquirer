            "text": "Since the original reports describing the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for transfer of \u03b2-galactosidase gene to muscle (Kessler et al., 1996; Xiao et al., 1996; Fisher et al., 1997) , recombinant AAVs (rAAV) have emerged as very efficient and potentially non-immunogenic vector candidates for delivering therapeutic genes to a variety of tissues and treating monogenic diseases. As they poorly activate innate immunity and weakly transduce dendritic cells, rAAV appear as far less immunogenic than adenoviral vectors (Zhang et al., 2000; Zaiss et al., 2002; McCaffrey et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, it has rapidly become clear that rAAV vectors carrying various transgenes can, under different conditions, induce potent immune responses that could ultimately lead to destruction of transduced cells in vivo and consecutive disappearance of transgene expression (Manning et al., 1997 (Manning et al., , 1998 Halbert et al., 1998; Brockstedt et al., 1999) . Not surprisingly therefore, their use has even been proposed in genetic vaccination protocols aimed at eliciting cellular and humoral immune responses against different microorganisms (Kuck et al., 2006; Du et al., 2008) . In primates and humans, rAAV administration has also been documented to elicit significant cytotoxic CD8 + T cell responses directed against the viral as well as the transgenic \"exogenous\" proteins, resulting in the destruction of transduced cells and complete loss of transgene expression (Manno et al., 2006; Mingozzi et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2009) . Additionally, on the side of the humoral immunity, production of neutralizing antibodies targeting capsid proteins may also prevent vector readministration and accelerate the loss of the therapeutic protein through the formation of immune complexes. Such immune complexes may further sensitize the cellular immune response by enhancing cross-presentation of the transgenic protein by the antigen-presenting cells (APC). Therefore, developing strategies to circumvent immune responses and facilitate long-term expression of transgenic therapeutic proteins has been identified as one of today's main challenges for the translation of rAAV vectors into the clinic (Mingozzi and High, 2011a,b; Nayak and Herzog, 2011) .",

            "text": "Depending on the experimental situation, rAAV-mediated gene transfer can either lead to durable transgene expression or, conversely, to the rapid formation of neutralizing antibodies and/or destruction of transduced cells by cytotoxic cells. Several factors influencing the immune response against transgenic proteins encoded by the rAAV vectors have now been identified including host species, route of administration, vector dose, immunogenicity of the transgenic protein, inflammatory status of the host and capsid serotype (Mays and Wilson, 2011) . These factors are thought to influence immunogenicity by triggering innate immunity, cytokine production, APC maturation, antigen presentation and, ultimately, priming of na\u00efve T lymphocytes to functional effectors. Therefore, the idea to dampen immune activation by interfering with these very mechanisms has logically emerged with the aim to induce a short-term immunosuppression, avoid the early immune priming that follows vector administration and promote long-term tolerance (Zaiss and Muruve, 2008) .",

            "text": "Here, we evaluated two different strategies to inhibit the undesirable immune activation that follows muscle gene transfer by acting at two different checkpoints of the immune response, i.e., on T cell priming or on the functions of activated T cells that may escape such priming blockade. We used the administration of CTLA-4/Ig to inhibit the substantial immune priming that immediately follow vector injection. Indeed, CTLA-4/Ig represent a potent immunosuppressive fusion protein that reversibly prevents T cell activation (Wallace et al., 1995) and is now used in the clinic to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Bluestone et al., 2006) . Its immunomodulatory action depends on its competitive inhibitory effect on the CD28/B7 pathway thereby preventing the pivotal CD28-dependent costimulation required to fully activate T lymphocytes (Salomon and Bluestone, 2001) . As a second strategy, we turned to immunomodulatory molecules that could protect transduced muscle fibers from immune attacks by activated T cells. For that, we aimed at stimulating the inhibitory PD-1 molecule expressed on T cells upon activation, by the gene transfer of its ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2 to muscle cells (Freeman et al., 2000; Latchman et al., 2001; Ishida et al., 2002) . We show herein that acting on these two non-redundant mechanisms of tolerance provides synergistic effects that prolong transgene expression in muscle even in the presence of circulating cytotoxic T cells directed against the transgene product.",

            "text": "Transgene expression in muscle was found to be high early after transduction but rapidly declined over time, suggesting the occurrence of an immune response against transduced cells ( Figure 1A) . To investigate this point, we quantified the cellular and humoral immune responses directed against the xenogenic Ova transgene product by flow cytometry and ELISA. Staining with MHC-I pentamers presenting the immunodominant Ova-derived SIINFEKL peptide, designated hereafter as H-2K b /Ova pentamers, allowed to monitor the expansion of CD8 + lymphocytes in spleen and draining lymph nodes of rAAV-Ova challenged animals. This analysis revealed that both rAAV2/1-Ova and rAAV2/8-Ova injected in the gastrocnemius muscles induced a robust expansion of anti-Ova CD8 + lymphocytes (Figures 1B,C) . Interestingly, the kinetics and intensity of T cell priming was found to be different when comparing the cells harvested from the draining lymph nodes and from the spleen. In the lymph nodes draining the injected muscles, anti-Ova CD8 + T cells expanded early after AAV challenge to reach around 2% of the CD8 + T cell compartment at day 7 post-injection ( Figure 1C , left panel). In contrast, when analyzing splenocytes, anti-Ova CD8 + T cells were found to reach up to 10% of the total CD8 + subset but only at day 14 after i.m. AAV injection ( Figure 1C , right panel). These results are consistent with a model in which the local cellular immune response measured in the draining lymph nodes would be induced by an rAAV leakage from the injected muscle and the consequent transduction of non-muscle cells such as dendritic cells, as shown for AAV5 (Xin et al., 2006) or AAV1 (Lu and Song, 2009 ) for instance. The systemic response detected in the spleen would rather reflect systemic immunization directed against the circulating sOva protein after it has been produced by transduced muscle cells. This interpretation is supported by the kinetics of sOva apparition and antibodies production ( Figure 1D) . Indeed, in the serum of AAVtreated mice, sOva reached a maximum at day 7 post-injection and rapidly declined thereafter ( Figure 1D , green curves). Consistently, anti-Ova IgG appeared between day 7 and 12 after AAV i.m. injection, correlating with the disappearance of sOva in the serum after day 7 ( Figure 1D , blue curves). The latter probably reflects the in vivo clearance of sOva following the formation of antigenantibody immune complexes, although we cannot completely rule out that anti-Ova IgG antibodies may mask Ova epitopes in the immunoassay. Together, these data reveal that i.m. injection of www.frontiersin.org rAAV encoding sOva is strongly immunogenic and provides a mouse model that is suited to stringently evaluate the efficacy of tolerance induction protocols.",

Indeed, we have previously shown in transgenic mice that express Ova as a neo-autoantigen in muscle that tolerant transgenic anti-Ova CD8 + T cells up-regulated PD-1, suggesting that PD-1 plays a role in the induction of tolerance to skeletal muscle-expressed Ag (Calbo et al., 2008) . As expected, the anti-Ova CD8 + T cell response that followed an i.m. injection of rAAV2/1-Ova (Figures 1B,C) was accompanied by an up-regulation of PD-1 on CD8 + T cells that exhibit an activated CD44 hi phenotype (Figure 2A) . As activated T cells express PD-1 and PD-1 ligands inhibit their activation and function, we generated rAAV2/1-PD-L1 and rAAV2/1-PD-L2 vectors and first verified that they were able to efficiently transduce HEK cells in vitro ( Figure 2B) . The expected consequence of injecting these vectors i.m. is that they should not prevent T cell priming but rather inhibit the cytotoxic activity of T cells directed against muscle-expressed transgenic proteins.",

Accordingly, mRNA analysis by qRT-PCR at day 80 revealed sustained transcription of the transgene in muscle (Figure 3C, right panel) . Of note, rAAV2/1-PD-L2 appeared equally as effective as rAAV2/1-PD-L1 to provide this effect when combined with CTLA-4/Ig.

To further attest the presence of functional anti-Ova cytotoxic T cells at day 80 (a time point when pentamer staining is not sensitive enough to detect anti-Ova T cells, not shown), we analyzed by ELISpot the capacity of CD8 + T cells to secrete IFN\u03b3 when stimulated with the Ova-derived immunodominant SIINFEKL peptide.

To definitively demonstrate that these IFN\u03b3-secreting T cells were functional in vivo, we performed adoptive transfer experiments to non-lethally irradiated syngenic recipients that were inoculated with Ova-bearing tumor cells. Whereas tumors rapidly developed in recipients that had received T cells from control mice that only received PBS, recipient mice receiving lymphocytes from rAAV2/1-Ova injected donors rapidly developed an anti-tumor immune response that resulted in complete tumor rejection (Figure 4B ). In agreement with the lower numbers of anti-Ova CD8 + T cells detected by ELISpot, recipient mice that had received immune cells from donors treated with CTLA-4/Ig or the combined CTLA-4/Ig plus rAAV-PD-L1 or rAAV-PD-L2 therapy reacted with a slight delay but were also was also capable to efficiently control tumor growth ( Figure 4B) .

Additional signals from the viral vector may further strengthen adverse innate and adaptive immune reactions against the transgene product, while the vector itself can be targeted by antiviral pre-existing or acquired immunity. Although the presence of natural epitopes in the non-mutated regions of the protein or the occasional occurrence of mutation reversion in a minute population of patients' cells (Klein et al., 1992) may yield some level of immunological tolerance, it remains that acquired immunity to the transgene product still represents one of the major obstacles to the success of gene therapy.

Whereas several costimulatory pathways have now been identified, CD28-mediated T cell costimulation by APC expressing CD80/CD86 molecules from the B7 family is clearly prominent. Indeed, CD28 signaling strongly enhances T cell proliferation and survival, cytokine production and prevents induction of anergy after TCR-mediated activation (Boise et al., 1995) . Consequently, anti-CD80 (B7.1) or anti-CD86 (B7.2) antibodies inhibit T cell priming and genetically engineered CD28-deficient T cells are strongly impaired in their capacity to expand (Green et al., 1994; Salomon and Bluestone, 2001) . T cells activation also promotes up-regulation of the negative regulator CTLA-4, another ligand of CD80 and CD86 molecules, which transmits inhibitory signals that regulate activated T cell and provides a key homeostatic mechanism of the immune response (Fife and Bluestone, 2008) . One of the early striking evidence of the key role of this molecule is that CTLA-4-deficient animal rapidly die FIGURE 4 | Detection of anti-Ova T cells in animals treated with combination therapies.

This fusion protein prevents CD28 interaction with CD80 and CD86 molecules on na\u00efve and activated T cells and therefore provides a strong and early inhibition on T cell priming (June et al., 1990; Lenschow et al., 1992; Larsen et al., 2005) . CTLA-4/Ig may also induce a negative signalization on the APC side through the induction of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which catalyses the production of inhibitory kynurenine from tryptophan (Grohmann et al., 2002) . CTLA-4/Ig may also possibly provide some level of APC depletion in vivo, although this aspect has been poorly documented and should critically depend on the form of CTLA-4/Ig used. Importantly, CTLA-4/Ig is now clinically available for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Dumont, 2004) and it is thus reasonable to propose its evaluation in the field of gene therapy. Indeed, there has been experimental evidence that CTLA-4/Ig in combination with a monoclonal antibody to CD40L (MR1) in the context of gene therapy can block immune responses and allow vector readministration in the mouse (Halbert et al., 1998; Lorain et al., 2008) . It is difficult to weight the relative roles of CTLA-4/Ig and MR1 in these experiments but a plausible hypothesis is that CTLA-4/Ig provides the strongest immunoregulatory contribution since MR1 alone has been reported to be less efficient in similar experimental conditions (Manning et al., 1998) . The results reported herein are consistent with these earlier reports and provide definitive evidence that CTLA-4/Ig alone efficiently, but only transiently, blocks anti-transgene T cell priming.",

The present results illustrate this point since initial CTLA-4/Ig efficiently blocks the anti-Ova cellular and humoral responses while sustained sOva production finally elicits this undesired response when CTLA-4/Ig is probably cleared from the circulation. Our experimental conditions have been purposely designed to model this very situation where the immune response escapes the initial immunoregulatory regimen in order to evaluate if a second strategy could provide additional protection of transduced cells, i.e., PD-L1/2 gene therapy.",

            "text": "The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has recently been identified as a negative regulator of immunity . The PD-1 immunoreceptor is also a member of the CD28/CTLA-4 family which, upon interaction with either one of its two ligands PD-L1 or PD-L2, down-modulates TCR signaling, reduces cytokine production and affects T cell survival by recruiting the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, thereby dampening the PI3K and Akt pathway (Francisco et al., 2010) . In BALB/c mice, PD-1 deficiency leads to the spontaneous development of a lethal autoimmune cardiomyopathy . This disease is mediated by autoantibodies directed against the cardiac muscle autoantigen troponin I (Okazaki et al., 2003) . Hence, PD-1 controls the physiological tolerance to muscle autoantigens. Also, PD-L1 was recently shown to regulate CD8 + T cell-mediated muscle injury in a mouse model of myocarditis (Grabie et al., 2007) . Several PD-1/PD-L1 dependant mechanisms may act synergistically to induce an effective effector T cell blockade and contribute to tolerance induction. As mentioned earlier, PD-1 engagement on the surface of T cell is known to significantly inhibit TCR signaling thereby preventing T cell activation and cytokine production. In addition to this mechanism, PD-L1 was recently shown to be a potent inducer of adaptive Tregs. Indeed, PD-L1 expressed on CD8 + dendritic cell subset plays an important role on the conversion of naive lymphocytes toward FoxP3 + regulatory T cells (Wang et al., 2008) . Thus, engagement of PD-1 on T cells could induce cell-intrinsic tolerance (by blocking TCR signaling) as well as a dominant form of immunological tolerance by promoting the emergence of FoxP3 + adaptive Tregs. Of note, manipulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is also used by some tumors cells to tolerize surrounding lymphocytes. Indeed, expression of PD-L1 on the surface of malignant cells has been suggested to represent a subversive strategy used by tumors to escape to immuno-surveillance . Thus, we believe that up-regulation of the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of muscle cells by the means of gene transfer should be able to induce tolerization of the immune system by preventing cytotoxicity of PD-1-expressing activated lymphocytes. However, PD-L1 gene transfer alone was not sufficient in our model to prevent the immune response directed against transduced muscle fibers (Figure 2) , suggesting that muscle expression of PD-L1, i.e., at distance from lymphoid compartments, is probably not capable of inducing sufficient adaptive FoxP3 + Tregs. Another explanation would be that PD-L1 expressed in muscle is not effective to block fully activated T cells that have received normal costimulatory signals (i.e., in the absence of CTLA-4/Ig co-administration). This interpretation would be in line with the finding that PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be overcome by CD28 costimulatory ligation in the presence of IL-2 (Freeman et al., 2000; Latchman et al., 2001; Carter et al., 2002; Ishida et al., 2002) . Hence, the use of CTLA-4/Ig to block early CD28 costimulatory signaling may create favorable conditions where escaping T cells could become sensitive to PD-L1/2. This strengthens the notion that CTLA-4 and PD-1 signaling represent two distinct pathways acting synergistically to maintain tolerance (Fife and Bluestone, 2008) . As shown herein, neither CTLA-4/Ig alone nor combination therapies could block immune response at days 40 and 80 (Figures 3 and 4) . Our results are thus compatible with the notion that the use of rAAV2/1-PD-L1 or rAAV2/1-PD-L2 in combination with CTLA-4/Ig, does not completely inhibit the immune priming against sOva that most probably occurs at distance from the site of transduction (e.g., spleen and/or lymph nodes) but instead provides an additional protection by disarming lymphocytes within the target tissue.",

Further, we show that even after CTLA-4/Ig alone or in combination therapies, an anti-Ova immune response is evidenced in ELISpot assays and in an in vivo model of tumor rejection upon adoptive transfer of T cells in recipient animals (Figure 4) . Hence, forced up-regulation of PD-1 ligands in muscle cells yielded a level of protection of transduced cells from the cytotoxic assault Frontiers in Microbiology | Microbial Immunology of circulating anti-Ova lymphocytes and provided in combination therapy a means to prolong transgene persistence and transcription. Therefore, CTLA-4/Ig plus PD-L1/2 combination therapy represents a candidate approach to circumvent the bottleneck of immune responses directed toward the transgene product and may deserve further investigation for non-secreted transgenic protein models and in larger animals.",
