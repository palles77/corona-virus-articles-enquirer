R 0 provides a threshold for elimination and determines when a disease can spread or when a disease will die out. Classically, R 0 is calculated assuming an infinite population of identical hosts. Previous work has shown that heterogeneity in the host mixing rate increases R 0 in an infinite population. However, it has been suggested that in a finite population, heterogeneity in the mixing rate may actually decrease the finitepopulation reproductive numbers. Here, we outline a framework for discussing different types of heterogeneity in disease parameters, and how these affect disease spread and control. We calculate \"finitepopulation reproductive numbers\" with different types of heterogeneity, and show that in a finite population, heterogeneity has complicated effects on the reproductive number. We find that simple heterogeneity decreases the finite-population reproductive number, whereas heterogeneity in the intrinsic mixing rate (which affects both infectiousness and susceptibility) increases the finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is small relative to the size of the population and decreases the finitepopulation reproductive number when R 0 is large relative to the size of the population. Although heterogeneity has complicated effects on the finite-population reproductive numbers, its implications for control are straightforward: when R 0 is large relative to the size of the population, heterogeneity decreases the finite-population reproductive numbers, making disease control or elimination easier than predicted by R 0 .",

Perhaps the most famous example of disease heterogeneity is typhoid Mary, who is estimated to have caused over 50 new cases, despite typhoid having an R 0 of 2.8 (Pitzer et al., 2014;  Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/yjtbi Brooks, 1996) .

May and Anderson explored the effects of heterogeneity on R 0 for directly transmitted diseases and showed that heterogeneity increases R 0 , making eradication harder under a homogeneously applied immunization program (May and Anderson, 1984) . Diekmann et al. (1990) defined and calculated R 0 for heterogeneous populations of directly-transmitted diseases. They calculated R 0 in terms of the next-generation operator, which maps generations of infected individuals to each other. Like other calculations of R 0 , it assumes one infected individual in an otherwise very large population of susceptible hosts. Dye and Hasibeder (1986) showed that for vector-borne diseases, heterogeneity in the mosquito biting rate increases R 0 , which suggests that heterogeneity makes invasion likely and elimination more difficult than would be predicted by a standard calculation of R 0 based on parameters. Lloyd- Smith et al. (2005) showed that for directly transmitted diseases with heterogeneous transmission, like SARS, both the probability that an epidemic will occur and the subsequent size of the epidemic will be affected: heterogeneity made extinction more likely than predicted by the standard calculation of R 0 , but if an epidemic did occur, it was more likely to be explosive.",

Often, heterogeneity is discussed in terms of presence/absence: a population is assumed to be homogeneous or it is not. Less attention is given to the type or types of heterogeneity in disease spread. When heterogeneity is discussed in more detail, it tends to be discussed in terms of heterogeneity in infected individuals, ie \"super-spreaders\" (Galvani and May, 2005; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Stein, 2011) and \"super-shedders\" (Caroline Breese Hall, 2007; Stephens et al., 2009; Chase-Topping et al., 2008) , likely because heterogeneity in susceptible individuals is harder to measure. However, clearly identifying and understanding the different types of heterogeneity and how they affect disease dynamics provides new opportunities for control. Here, we outline a framework for discussing heterogeneity in individual-level parameters.",

            "text": "The mixing rate, also called \"contact rate\" describes the number of contacts that an individual has that could result in an infection. Mixing rates vary by modes of transmission and by disease. The contact rate for a vector-borne disease depends on hosts being bitten by vectors and consequently, it is dependent both on host-related and vector-related factors. The mixing rate for an STI is the number of potentially infectious sexual contacts an individual has. This can be affected by a multitude of factors including condom use, etc. For other directly transmitted diseases, the mixing rate may be harder to quantify and depend on specific disease-related factors such as how long infectious particles remain in the air or stay alive on surfaces, and environmental factors such as humidity (Caroline Breese Hall, 2007; Bean et al., 1982; Karim et al., 1985; Miller and Artenstein, 1967; Kao and Yang, 2006) . Heterogeneity affects mixing rates in a multitude of ways. For a vector-borne disease, such as malaria, heterogeneity in the mixing rate is often a result of host-related factors, such as differential attractiveness to mosquitoes (e.g. Port et al., 1980; Shirai et al., 2004; Lindsay et al., 2000) or the use of bed nets (Lengeler et al., 2004) . Heterogeneity in the mixing rate for sexually transmitted infections can be affected by including rate of sexual partner change, sexual practices (Joseph Hotz Avner Ahituv and Philipson, 1996) , and access to condoms (Chimbindi et al., 2010; MacPhail et al., 2009; Bassett and Mhloyi, 1991; Pettifor et al., 2004) . For directly transmitted diseases, contacts are often harder to define, and heterogeneity arises from a mixture of host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Heterogeneity in the mixing rate can be further broken down into the mixing rate of infected individuals and the mixing rate of susceptible individuals. Here, we assume that individuals have an intrinsic mixing rate that does not change with infection status.",

For example, vectorborne and sexually transmitted diseases involve symmetric contact (both the susceptible and infected individual need to be bitten by a vector, or to have sexual intercourse to transmit disease), whereas food-borne illnesses often involve asymmetric contact (food workers infect food consumers, but not the other way around). Ebola virus disease is an example where behavior is changed by disease: effective mixing rates of well people depend on how likely they are to be involved in care-giving, and likely vary less than the effective mixing rates of infectious people.

Since the finitepopulation reproductive numbers are limited by the size of the population whereas the infinite reproductive numbers are not, the finite-population reproductive numbers diverge from their corresponding infinite population reproductive number as R 0 approaches the size of the population. Where they diverge depends on both the distribution and the coefficient of variation of that distribution; although where the finite-population reproductive numbers depend on these factors, the finite-population reproductive number with CV \u00bc3 diverges around 1/5 N whereas the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number diverges around 1/2 N. Further, for heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing, the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are larger than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is small relative to the size of the population and the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are smaller than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R 0 is large relative to the size of the population. For gamma distributed heterogeneity, this occurs between 1/3 N and 3/4 N ( Fig. 2(a) ) and at around N for log-normally distributed heterogeneity (Fig. B3) .

Of particular interest is the effect of heterogeneity in transmission on R 0 (Dye and Hasibeder, 1986; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Alex Perkins et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2007) . In an infinite population of susceptible hosts, heterogeneity has been shown to increase R 0 , whereas in a finite population, we show that heterogeneity has a more complicated effect on the reproductive number. Smith et al.

However, when the size of the population is small relative to R 0 , many more people are contacted multiple times, absorbing some possible infections, reducing R m \u00f0N\u00de Figs. 2 and B3.

For very small values of the CV, the finite-population reproductive numbers converge on the homogeneous finitepopulation reproductive number; as CV increases, so does the effect of heterogeneity.",

And although heterogeneity in the mixing rate has a more complicated effect on the finite-population reproductive number, it has the same implications for control: it suggests that for a disease with a large R 0 spreading in a small heterogeneous population, the actual reproductive number may be lower than the standard calculation of R 0 , making control easier than predicted.",
