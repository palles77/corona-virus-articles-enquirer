In this regard, a series of 1-[x-(phenoxy)alkyl]uracil derivatives were synthesized and examined for antiviral properties. Compounds 17, 20, 24 and 28 were found to exhibit highly specific and promising inhibitory activity against HCMV replication in HEL cell cultures with EC 50 values within 5.5-12 lM range. Further studies should be undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of action of these compounds and the structure-activity relationship for the linker region.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) belongs to the viral family known as Herpesviridae, and is also known as human herpesvirus-5 (HHV-5). Within Herpesviridae, HCMV belongs to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily. 1 One characteristic feature of the herpesviruses, including HCMV, is the ability to remain latent within the body after infection. 2 Latent HCMV is present in approximately 90% of adults aged over 80 in the U.S., 3 and typically goes unnoticed in healthy people, but can be life-threatening for the immunocompromised person. In this regard, HIV-infected persons, 4,5 organ transplant recipients, 6 or newborn infants are all at high risk of infection. Transplacental HCMV transmission can lead to congenital abnormalities and stillbirth, thus represents one of the most common viral causes of birth defects. 7 HCMV infection may also cause mucoepidermoid carcinoma and possibly other malignancies. 8 Moreover, a number of studies have revealed that HCMV is associated with autoimmune diseases, 9 atherosclerosis, 10 coronary restenosis 11, 12 and increased risk of diabetes. 13, 14 To date only three anti-HCMV agents, ganciclovir, 15 cidofovir, 16 and foscarnet, 17 have been approved for clinical use. They exhibit their effects by inhibiting the activity of the HCMV polymerase, thus reducing viral replication in patients with recognized HCMV infection symptoms. The use of these drugs however has been severely limited by their toxicity. 18 In addition, due to their inherent poor oral bioavailability, they must be administered intravenously to reach appropriate therapeutic levels. The exception to this limitation is valganciclovir, the orally administered prodrug for ganciclovir. 19 Unfortunately, as is typical for many nucleoside drugs, the development of drug-resistant viral strains has emerged. [20] [21] [22] Thus, there is an urgent need for new and more effective anti-HCMV agents with improved activity and pharmacokinetic profiles.",

Potent anti-HCMV and anti-VZV activity was also noted for other heterocyclic-based inhibitors including imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives 3 26-28 and benzothiadiazines 4. 29, 30 Other examples of broad-spectrum herpesvirus inhibitors are represented by derivatives of fused heterocyclic systems including the quinolones, 31 (6) , all developed by Pfizer (Fig. 1) .

Most of the compounds proved to be inhibitory against HCMV. In examining the structure activity relationship for the compounds, it appears that the activity is strongly dependent upon the substituent at the para-position of the benzene core. Polar groups proved unfavorable and resulted in a loss of activity (compounds 18, 21, 29) . Activity for alkyl substituted compounds increased with the size of the substituent: EC 50 for H (9) = Me (12) < i-Pr (14) < t-Bu (15), however, introduction of a bulky phenyl group led to poor activity for 16, thus there appears to be a steric limit. The 4-cyano-(17) and 4-bromo- (20) substituted compounds were found to exhibit the highest activity, which was comparable to ganciclovir. Interestingly, the 4chloro-substituted compound 19 was essentially inactive. One possible rationale for these observations could be complementary polar interactions between the halogen-or cyano-substituents and an appropriate protein functionality, for example, a carbonyl group, since the oxygen-containing compound 29 was inactive. This assumption is partially supported by the fact that reduction of NO 2 -group in inactive compound 21 led to 4-amino substituted compound 30 which exhibited slight anti-HCMV activity.",
