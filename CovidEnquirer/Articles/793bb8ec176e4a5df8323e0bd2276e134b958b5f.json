In addition, the differentiation conditions induce elevated levels of serine proteases, which are essential for productive infection of human influenza viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. We also established improved 2D monolayer culture conditions for the differentiated airway organoids. To demonstrate the ability of differentiated airway organoids to identify human-infective virus, 3D and 2D differentiated airway organoids are applied to evaluate two pairs of viruses with known distinct infectivity in humans, H7N9/Ah versus H7N2 and H1N1pdm versus an H1N1 strain isolated from swine (H1N1sw). The humaninfective H7N9/Ah virus replicated more robustly than the poorly human-infective H7N2 virus; the highly human-infective H1N1pdm virus replicated to a higher titer than the counterpart H1N1sw.

The segmented RNA genomes of IAVs and the low fidelity of RNA polymerase allow antigenic shift and drift, which drive the viral evolution. Thus, novel viruses from birds and pigs cross the species barrier and infect humans, leading to sporadic infections, epidemics, and even pandemics (1, 2) . Despite the tremendous progress made in virology and epidemiology, which subtype or strain of IAV will cause the next outbreak remains unpredictable. A novel reassortant H7N9 influenza virus from poultry has led to recurrent outbreaks of human infection in China since 2013 (2, 3) . More than 1,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 human infections were reported by October 2017, with a case-fatality rate higher than 35% (4). In 2009, the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century was caused by a novel pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm), which originated via multiple reassortments of \"classical\" swine H1N1 virus with human H3N2 virus, avian virus, and avian-like swine virus (5). While swine viruses infect humans only sporadically, this novel strain of swine-derived H1N1pdm virus has infected a large proportion of the human population, establishing sustained human-to-human transmission and circulating globally as a seasonal virus strain since then.",

HA proteins of low-pathogenic avian IAVs and human IAVs carry a single basic amino acid arginine at the cleavage site (6, 7), recognized by trypsin-like serine proteases. Productive infection of Significance Influenza virus infection represents a major threat to public health worldwide. There is no biologically relevant, reproducible, and readily available in vitro model for predicting the infectivity of influenza viruses in humans. Based on the longterm expanding 3D human airway organoids, we developed proximal differentiation and further established a 2D monolayer culture of airway organoids. The resultant 3D and 2D proximal differentiated airway organoids can morphologically and functionally simulate human airway epithelium and as a proof of concept can discriminate human-infective influenza viruses from poorly human-infective viruses. Thus, the proximal differentiated airway organoids can be utilized to predict the infectivity of influenza viruses and, more broadly, provide a universal platform for studying the biology and pathology of the human airway. these viruses in the human airway thus requires serine proteases such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, HAT, and others (8) . However, HA proteins of highly pathogenic avian viruses, such as H5N1, contain a polybasic cleavage site which is activated by ubiquitously expressed proteases. Current in vitro models for studying influenza infection in the human respiratory tract involve shortterm cultures of human lung explants and primary airway epithelial cells. Human lung explants are not readily available on a routine basis. In addition, the rapid deterioration of primary tissue is a major problem in infection experiments, since there is no protocol to maintain tissue viability in vitro. Under air-liquid interface conditions, basal cells isolated from human airway can polarize and undergo mucociliary differentiation. However, this capacity is lost within two or three passages (9) . Collectively, these primary tissues and cells hardly constitute a convenient, reproducible model to study human respiratory pathogens. Although various cell lines, e.g., A549 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, have been commonly used to propagate influenza viruses and to study their virology, they poorly recapitulate the histology of human airway epithelium. In addition, due to the low serine protease activity, most cell lines do not support the growth of the influenza viruses with a monobasic HA cleavage site unless the culture medium is supplemented with an exogenous serine protease, trypsin treated with N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK). Thus, a biologically relevant, reproducible, and readily available in vitro model remains urgently needed for studying the biology and pathology of the human respiratory tract.",

Apical ACCTUB clearly indicated the orientation of polarization. Most organoids are orientated towards the lumen (Fig. 1A , ACCTUB Left), while a small proportion of the organoids are inverted (Fig. 1A , ACCTUB Right). Beating cilia were visible (Movie S1). No type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells were present. Thus, these organoids resembled the pseudostratified ciliated airway epithelium. The AOs were inoculated with human IAV H1N1pdm, the low-pathogenic avian virus H7N9/Ah, and the highly pathogenic avian virus H5N1. The intracellular (cell lysate) viral loads of all three virus strains increased over 2 log 10 units (Fig. 1B) .

In fact, other subtypes of avian IAVs, including H7N2, H9N2, and H9N9, have been cocirculating with the H7N9 viruses in domestic poultry.

For virus inoculation, organoids must be sheared to enable sufficient apical exposure to virus inoculum (21) . As reported previously, primary bronchial epithelial cells cultured in Transwell inserts with the defined medium undergo mucociliary differentiation (22) . This prompted us to transform 3D AOs into a 2D monolayer using Transwell culture. To this end, 3D AOs were enzymatically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, seeded in Transwell inserts, and then cultured in PD medium. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in the 2D monolayers stabilized in the second week after seeding (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). In addition, the dextran penetration assay performed at day 12 indicated that an intact epithelial barrier was formed across the 2D monolayers (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). The intense signal of ACCTUB indicated that the 2D monolayers developed appreciable PD (Fig. 5A) . The productive infection of H7N9/Ah was clearly shown by the virus nucleoprotein-positive (NP + ) cells at 8 h post infection (hpi) in the 2D PD organoids (Fig. 5A) .",

The higher replicative capacity of H7N9/Ah over H7N2 virus was more pronounced in the 2D PD organoids than in the 3D PD organoids; the viral titer of H7N9/Ah in the apical medium was 3-4 log 10 units higher than that of the H7N2 virus (Fig. 5B) . Consistently, H1N1pdm replicated dramatically, with a viral titer in the apical medium 1-2 log 10 units higher than that of H1N1sw. Due to the epithelial barrier formed in the 2D monolayers and the preferential release of virus from the cell apical side, the viral titers in the basolateral medium were consistently lower than those in apical medium at the corresponding time points. Nevertheless, the differences in replicative capacity between H7N9/ Ah versus H7N2 and H1N1pdm versus H1N1sw were even more prominent in basal medium than in apical medium at most time points.",

In particular, our differentiation conditions increase the numbers of ciliated cells (Fig. 2) , the major cell type in the human airway epithelium. The PD medium induces ciliated cell numbers to a nearly physiological level, with synchronously beating cilia readily discernible in every organoid (Movies S2 and S3). In addition, the expression levels of serine proteases (Fig. 3) , known to be important for productive viral infection, were elevated after PD. Among the up-regulated HA-activating serine proteases, the dramatically increased expression of HAT in the differentiated AOs can very likely be attributed to the increased abundance of ciliated cells, since ciliated cells are the main source of HAT in the human respiratory tract (23) . Thus, the differentiated AOs can simulate the human airway epithelium morphologically and functionally. As a further improvement, we developed 2D PD airway monolayers with an intact epithelial barrier to allow exclusively apical exposure to viruses (Fig. 5A  and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ), the natural mode of IAV infection in the human respiratory tract. We then utilized two pairs of viruses with known infectivity to demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that these organoids indeed show significantly higher susceptibility to the human-infective viruses than to the poorly human-infective viruses. These 3D and 2D differentiated AOs support the active replication of human-infective H7N9/Ah and H1N1pdm. In contrast, the H7N2 virus, which has been temporally and spatially cocirculating with H7N9 viruses in domestic poultry and contains internal genes similar to those in H7N9 viruses, replicated much less efficiently in both models. Similarly, the swine H1N1 isolate showed a substantially lower growth capacity than its counterpart, human-adapted H1N1pdm (Fig. 5B) .",

While pigs are considered the intermediate hosts for interspecies transmission of IAVs, swine influenza viruses lacking human adaptation markers rarely infect humans. Sporadic human infections documented in the literature or reported by public health officials are generally mild or subclinical (25) . The ability of the PD AOs to differentiate avian H7 subtype virus and swine H1 subtype virus from the counterpart human-infective viruses suggests that these models could be used to assess the cross-species transmission potential of emerging influenza viruses in humans. In this study, only four strains of virus were assessed in the differentiated AOs as a proof of concept.
