A period of unprecedented growth and reform was on the way prior to emergence of Ebola virus disease. Guinea held its first free election in 2010, and the International Monetary Fund had forecasted its economy would grow 4.5% that year on the back of massive iron ore deposits. Liberia had been forecasted to grow at 7% on its rising mining activity, while Sierra Leone was expected to be Africa's fastest growing economy at 13.9%, according to International Monetary Fund.",

            "text": "The economic indicator used to gauge the status of involved country's economy is the gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the total dollar value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period, and percentage change can be used to gauge growth on a year-to-year basis. For example, if the GDP in Guinea is up 4.5%, this represents that the economy has grown by 4.5% over the last year. According to a report by Elvin Mayer, the GDP is calculated either by adding up what everyone earned in a year (income approach), or by adding up what everyone spent (expenditure method). 2 Ibrahim Abdullah was a truck business owner of Lebanese descent, whose ancestors left Lebanon in the late nineteenth century during the final years of Ottoman rule. 3 He was a 5-year-old child in March 1991, 3 when an attack on a small southern village by a group of armed Sierra Leoneans, Liberians, and Burkinabes identifying themselves as the Revolutionary United Front started a 9-year-civil conflict. Like almost any family in Sierra Leon, he had lost many relatives and was forced to move to Liberia. Over the last decade, he rose through society to own a truck business comprising of a fleet of Caterpillar trucks. He had purchased three of the trucks in the early part of 2014 as part of an agreement with Western Cluster-Liberia to transport iron ore from Bomi and Grand Cape Mount counties. ArcelorMittal, a major mining company, mined iron ore, the main ingredient in making steel and was one of his lead customers. The company's highly profitable Liberian unit produced 5 million tons of iron ore a year, at a cost of less than $30 per ton, below that of most other countries. With iron ore prices falling but still around $100 per ton that made for hefty profit margins. Therefore, Abdullah had every reason to use his lifesavings to expand the business to meet the increasing demands. When reports of Ebola virus-infected patients in Sierra Leon started to emerge, the company reaffirmed its commitment and determination to operate within the scope of the Mineral Development Agreement and ensure that infrastructures are protected as well as the well-being of the people are guaranteed. It was a Monday morning like any other, but that morning, less than half of the drivers showed up for work. Some were sick or taking care of sick relatives, but most wanted to avoid the weak subgrade road travels through villages with Ebola virus-infected patients. With most of the available drivers willing to work longer for extra pay, Abdullah had successfully devised a plan to continue the transport routes scheduled for the week. Then he received a phone call from the representative of ArcelorMittal that the company declared force majeure and evacuated 645 employees from Sierra Leon. 3 Roughly 4000 other employees and contractors in Liberia stayed to secure equipment and carry out other critical activities related to logistics, engineering, and procurement. 3 Abdullah's trucking business was no longer necessary given that the much smaller amount of iron ore expected to be produced could be transported through railway tracks. Abdullah was devastated because he had overextended his company and personal resources for this venture and now had no means to recuperate from the sudden loss of revenue. He had no recourse to enforce the contracts that he had signed with the company because the legal departments of the mining giants had defaulted using the force majeure clause.",

He would scramble over the next few months desperately trying to avoid a complete closure of his business while ArcelorMittal (MT) would go on to report a net income of $22 million or a penny per share in the third quarter of 2014, contrary to a loss of $193 million or 12 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues had gone up 2.2% year over year to $20.1 billion due to increased sales as a result of increased steel shipments and higher marketable iron ore shipments.

The direct effect is probably most apparent and is based on consumption of health-care resources and removal of people either temporarily or permanently from the labor force. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report released on September 20, 2014, in the three affected countries 2803 deaths occurred out of 5843 of total Ebola virus disease cases detected, including confirmed, probable, and suspected cases. 5 Some analysts fear that the true numbers may in fact be as large as two to four times what is reported due to underreporting issues. The major proportion of these deaths occurred in young persons, which exaggerates the workforce depletion effect. Contraction of labor resource resulted from largely workers who were diagnosed and subsequently died from the virus infection.",

There was an unmeasured effect of people staying home due to fear of exposure to the virus. All these factors resulted in reduced productivity, lower output, and lesser household income. The reduction in workforce cannot be compensated by smaller businesses that lack the ability to provide work retribution or shed less profitable parts of the business.

Other behavioral effects in these countries include people who are moving from diseased zones, the decrease in labor participation mainly due to people staying home from their jobs, foreign companies scared of the disease and getting rid of their employees, and closing borders for export of various materials. Such effects also motivate private decision-makers to disrupt travel, trade, and commerce by canceling scheduling commercial flights and reducing in shipping and cargo services. Some governments are motivated to close land borders and restrict entry of citizens from afflicted countries. 6",

The mining sector accounts for 17% of Liberia's GDP. ArcelorMittal (MT), the largest mining company in the country, decided to postpone its planned investment to expand its production capacity from 5.2 million tons of iron ore to 15 million tons, and China Union, the second largest mining company has shut down its operations since August 2014. As a result, mining sector growth forecast by the World Bank for 2014 has been revised from 4.4% growth to 1.3% contraction (Table 13 .2). The mining sector of Sierra Leone, which accounts for about 16% of the country's GDP, has not been affected considerably by the Ebola virus infection outbreak, in contrast to the neighboring countries reviewed in Table  13 .3. However, iron ore prices recently decreased considerably, and mining revenue is expected to decrease. 7 Compared to Liberia and Sierra Leone, the mining sector in Guinea does not make up a major component of the economy. The initial projection of mining sector growth was \u22123% and the revised projection of \u22123.4% is only slightly worse (Table 13 .4). This is also due to the fact that Guinea's major mines are far from the infected zones, and the expected contraction is not expected to deteriorate.",

Agriculture accounts for nearly a quarter of the Liberia's GDP and employs almost half of the available workforce. 8 The major reason for the severe impact on both export and domestic agriculture is due to reduced workforce mobility, people migrating to safe zones, and foreign companies postponing investment due to the evacuation of key expatriates affected. As a result, the World Bank revised its growth expectations from 3.5% to 1.3% (Table 13. 2). Disruptions from the outbreak during the planting season earlier this year are expected to diminish yields for the staple crops of rice and maize during the harvest season, between October and December. Due to the neglect of many small farms that produce food for domestic consumption, the World Bank expects Liberia to experience food shortages that may in turn lead to food price increases. 8 Similarly, Sierra Leone's agricultural sector, which focuses on rice, cocoa, and palm oil, accounts for about half of the economy. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Food Security, the two regions that were the epicenter of the Ebola virus infection outbreak together produced about 18% of the domestic rice output. Quarantined zones restricted worker movement and many farms were abandoned. According to the reports cited by the World Bank, rice prices jumped by 30% in the affected regions of the country. 8 A large amount of Guinea economy is composed of agriculture and services. There was tremendous decrease in the production of cocoa and palm oil, which are the main export products of the sector and now threatens Guinea's economy. 8 Service:",

According to a Bloomberg Report, in Gambia, \"hotel bookings are down by 65 percent due to a fear of the virus.\" 10 This is being attributed to a \"geographic misfortune\" of \"being located within a few hundred kilometers of Senegal's border with Guinea.\" 10 In the unaffected countries in Africa, the stigma of the outbreak is having an impact on potential international investors and multinationals operating in these countries. 10 In East African countries like Kenya, the geographical impact of the Ebola virus disease outbreak is also affecting major sectors like tourism and transportation. 10 However, since the recent Ebola virus disease outbreak began in December 2013, the global airline industry is perhaps the worst affected and has led to several countries imposing various rules and regulations on air travel, including strict measures like increased passenger screenings. A report by the Official Airline Guide says that, before the outbreak in 2013, 264,300 passengers traveled by air from the affected countries to either Europe or North America. However, as of October 2014, year-onyear capacity and frequency are down by 64% from the affected countries. In May 2014, there were some 427 flights from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to any destination in the world. In October, that had fallen to some 152 flights scheduled, providing some 22,782 seats. 10",

It is unknown if the baby died at the yard or if the girl was already dead. Residents said this was not the first such incident, as dumping newborns is increasing since Ebola virus disease broke out in the country.\" 11 Although not uncommon in the past, dumping of newborns has greatly increased since the recent outbreak in the country. The reason is either that the pregnant patient is too afraid to visit the health-care facility due to the fear of Ebola virus disease or, if she is at home, no one will help her because they are afraid of contact with the bodily fluids. Many of the health-care clinics refused to treat pregnant women due to fear of coming into contact with blood and other bodily fluids of women, and sometimes they even do not know if the patient is Ebola virus infected or not. When nothing else works, the patients end up giving birth in the streets. According to an estimate by UNFPA, there will be more than 800,000 women who will give birth in the next 12 months, and 120,000 of these pregnant women will face complications during pregnancy and childbirth and could die if the required lifesaving emergency obstetric care is not provided. This report also states that they still need 64.5 million dollars to provide all the services required to promote health of the expectant mothers and the newborn babies in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Currently, they only have $3 million for this purpose. 11 If these appropriate measures are not taken, they warn that one in seven pregnant women in these West African countries could die during childbirth. 12 There may be a reduction in workforce due to newborn and infant mortality that will be felt two to four decades from now if situation does not improve.",

The researchers also found that men born in 1919 were shorter by about 0.05 inches relative to surrounding cohorts and were of lower weights as teenager with a higher percentage of various health issues. 13 In addition, children born to those women who had been infected with flu were three to seven times more likely to develop schizophrenia later in life. All of these health-related conditions caused not only an increase in economic burden of the country due to increased utilization of health-care expenses, but also led to inefficient and impaired workforce of the country. With the example of pandemic flu how the economy of the country could continue to be affected years later even after the outbreak, we hope that the Ebola virus disease outbreak is aggressively controlled; so, the duration is shortened enough to prevent unwanted health-related effects on the babies born during this period. 14 The Ebola virus disease epidemic continues to spread rapidly in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. If the virus continues to surge in the three worstaffected countries and spans to neighboring countries, the 2-year-regional financial impact could probably reach $32.6 billion by the end of year 2015 9 dealing a potentially catastrophic blow to already fragile states. These economic costs can be limited if swift national and international responses succeed in preventing the spread of the virus and mitigating fear resulting from people's concerns about contagion fueling the economic impact. 12",

Part of the challenges to the political infrastructure were related to travel and transport limitations; restrictions on the movement of individuals; and constraints on the people's right of assembly, and community by laws which have led to a \"do not touch\" policy. The Sierra Leonean government has stopped spending money on services not directly related to battling Ebola virus disease and day-to-day service facilities have largely deteriorated. Open criticism of the government followed as a consequence. Sierra Leon's citizens have begun to question the president Dr Ernest Bai Koroma regarding his capacity to handle the challenges. In one such incident, a journalist was arrested after a guest condemned the President's way of handling the Ebola virus disease outbreak on his inadequate effort to institute emergency measures in the face of the epidemic. 15 The Ministry of Health Sanitation (MOHS) has faced a lot of criticism. President Koroma has also faced disapproval for supporting Miatta Kargbo, Minister for Health and Sanitation. Kargbo's situation became increasingly weak from June 2014, after she suggested that victims of Ebola virus disease had a role in acquiring the infection and deaths could have been avoided if victims had appropriately responded. She had gone on further in criticizing health care workers for the spread of Ebola virus disease through immoral acts. In August 29, 2014, she was removed from office, with the President mentioning the need \"to create a conducive environment for efficient and effective handling of the Ebola outbreak.\" The MOHS was quite overwhelmed by Ebola virus disease and was looking for an outside source for assistance to handle the crisis.",

Some of the initial steps taken that assured control of the government were the imposition of a 3-day, nationwide lockdown in September 2014 and sanctioning of the extension of emergency measures for another 9 months. Moreover, President Koroma's increased presence at isolation units and treatment centers and occasions celebrating survivors, improved morale. The government provided ongoing support of the development of a remote education curriculum to counter balance the schools remaining closed. The President received a crossparty support, from Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) leader, Brigadier (Rtd) Julius Maada Bio, and thus succeeded to create a logic of national unity. 17 In Liberia, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said under the state of emergency, the government will introduce astonishing methods, if need to be the suspension of certain rights and privileges as authorized by the constitution for a 90-day period. The outbreak has exacerbated a lack of trust that many Liberians have in their government. Because of the current uncertainties due to the Ebola virus disease epidemic, several investors, aid workers, and skilled employees started to leave the country despite continuous pleas from the Liberian finance minister for continued assistance. Elections originally scheduled for early October were continually postponed. In a nation where years of civil war have deeply undermined trust in government and its institutions, some worried a constitutional crisis would be one of Ebola virus disease's deadliest symptoms. Concerns regarding political and social unrest leading to coup and civil war still prevail. 18 Similarly, Guinea is also facing political challenges particularly in light of upcoming elections. There are apprehensions among citizens that the delays in the organization of local elections will increase prevailing tensions between the government and the opposition parties. 16 ",
