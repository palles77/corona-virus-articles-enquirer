Along with other innate immunity, this nonspecific response would either clear the invading viruses or allow the adaptive immune system to establish an effective antiviral response at late stages of the infection. The objective of this study was to characterize cellular mechanisms exploited by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to regulate the induction of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, at the transcriptional level. The results showed that IBV infection of cultured human and animal cells activated the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and induced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8. Meanwhile, IBV has developed a strategy to counteract the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 by inducing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a negative regulator of the p38 MAPK, in order to limit the production of an excessive amount of IL-6 and IL-8 in the infected cells. As activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and induction of IL-6 and IL-8 may have multiple pathogenic effects on the whole host as well as on individual infected cells, regulation of the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop by IBV may modulate the pathogenesis of the virus.",

            "text": "The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against an invading viral pathogen and the outcome of an infection is dependent on the ability of host cells to recognize the invading pathogen and activate appropriate signaling pathways. Cells are equipped with a group of proteins known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon stimulation by pathogens, multiple signaling pathways are activated, leading to the induction of a number of latent transcription factors and the establishment of an anti-viral state (Sen, 2001) . In cells infected with RNA and DNA viruses, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is produced as a replication intermediate and recognized as PAMPs by three major types of RNA sensors, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), Tolllike receptor (TLR) 3, and retinoid acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (Mda5), leading to the induction of type 1 interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Garcia et al., 2007; Takeuchi and Akira, 2009 ). Cytokines produced during a viral infection are potent immunomodulatory molecules that act as mediators of inflammation and the immune response. They are key regulators in governing host defense against pathogens. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6, and IL-8 are produced early in the infection, triggering the production of Th1 cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 involved in cellular immune responses. In this report, the cellular mechanisms exploited by coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to regulate the induction of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, at the transcriptional level were studied.",

Of the three MAPK pathways described in mammalian cells, the ERK pathway, the JNK pathway, and the p38 MAPK pathway, the ERK pathway is activated by mitogenic and proliferative stimuli, whereas the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways are activated by environmental stresses. So far, four p38 isoforms, p38\u03b1, p38\u03b2, p38\u03b3 and p38\u03b4, have been identified (Nebreda and Porras, 2000) . Among them, p38\u03b1 is the most widely expressed and best characterized isoform. Evidence available suggests that p38 MAPK activates a specific set of transcription factors, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. For example, embryonic stem cells derived from p38\u03b1 MAPK-null mice showed a reduced IL-6 production in response to chemical stress (Allen et al., 2000) .",

Prolonged activation of p38 MAPK in DUSP1-deficient macrophages (Chattopadhyay et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2005) indicates that p38 MAPK is the target of DUSP1 (Franklin and Kraft, 1997) .

IBV infection of chickens causes an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease (Fang et al., 2007 (Fang et al., , 2005 Shen et al., 2004) . It initially infects the upper respiratory tract, where it is restricted to the ciliated and mucus-secreting cells (Raj and Jones, 1997) . High virus titers were detected in the nose, trachea, lung, and airsacs (Ambali and Jones, 1990; Hofstad and Yoder, 1966) . Following infection of chickens by IBV, interferon was detected in trachea and lung (Otsuki et al., 1987) . Chicken type 1 interferon reduced replication of IBV in chicken tracheal organ culture and kidney cell culture (Pei et al., 2001) . Intravenous or oral application of type I interferon delayed the onset of disease in chickens and its severity. In this study, analysis of the infected cells by Affymetrix microarray, semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot revealed the induction of IRF1, DUSP1, IL-6 and IL-8 at the transcriptional level. Activation of p38 MAPK was found in cells infected with IBV. Furthermore, this study showed that p38 activity was responsible for the induction of the two pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. The p38 MAPK activity was regulated by IBV-induced up-regulation of DUSP1, resulting in the suppression of excessive induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Vero cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of approximately 1 and harvested at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h post-infection. Total RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis with DIG-labeled DNA probes for IL-6, IL-8, and IRF1, respectively. IBV RNAs were also detected to indicate the efficiency of viral infection, and GAPDH as a loading control for normalization. As shown in Fig. 1A , IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 mRNAs were gradually increased after 8 h post-infection, and peaked at 24 h post-infection. Quantification of the corresponding bands by densitometry showed that IL-6 mRNA was induced 17-fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 109-fold at 24 h post-infection, IL-8 mRNA was induced 3fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 57-fold at 24 h post-infection, and IRF1 was induced 2-fold at 8 h post-infection and continued to increase to 8-fold at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1A) . It was noted that the folds of IL-6 and IL-8 induction obtained by this approach were much higher than those obtained by Affymetrix and real-time RT-PCR assays. Nevertheless, these results clearly demonstrate that IL-6, IL-8, and IRF1 are induced at the mRNA level in Vero cells infected with IBV.",

Vero, H1299 and Huh7 cells were individually infected with IBV and harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h post-infection, respectively. Mock-infected cells harvested at 24 h post-infection were used as negative controls for each cell line. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1 showed that all three factors were induced with various efficiencies at the transcriptional level in all the three cell lines. Quantification of the PCR bands showed that IL-6 was induced 4-to 5-fold, IL-8 was induced 2-to 12-fold, and IRF1 was induced 4-to 10-fold over the time-course in IBV-infected H1299 cells (Fig. 2) . In IBV-infected Huh7 cells, IL-6 was induced 2to 7-fold, IL-8 was induced 11-to 13-fold, and IRF1 was induced 3to 5-fold (Fig. 2) . In IBV-infected Vero cells, IL-6 was induced 2-to 6-fold, IL-8 was induced 3-to 7-fold, and IRF1 was induced 5-to 31-fold (Fig. 2) . It was noted that minor induction of these cytokines was also observed in mock-treated cells which might be due to the serum starvation or cell overgrowth (Fig. 2 ). After normalization, the relative induction folds of IL-6 and IL-8 in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 h post-infection determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR were roughly comparable to those obtained by Affymetrix and realtime RT-PCR assays. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was therefore used to quantify the induction folds of these factors in most experiments described in the subsequent sections. IBV gRNA(+) was detected for indication of efficient viral replication, showing gradually increased accumulation of the viral gRNA(+) over time (Fig. 2) . These observations further confirm that IBV infection of cultured cells from different origins induces the transcription of IL-6, IL-8 and IRF1.",

SB203580 inhibits the p38 MAPK activity by blocking its catalytic function but not phosphorylation, resulting in the suppression of the downstream substrate activation in the p38 MAPK pathway (Kumar et al., 1999) . H1299 cells were either treated with 50 \u03bcM of SB203580 or mock-treated with DMSO alone for 1 h prior to IBV infection and throughout the time-course.

Negative control siRNA was transfected into another set of cells as a control.

However, in p38-knockdown cells, the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 was progressively suppressed from 12 to 15 h postinfection, and reduced to a minimal level at 18 h post-infection (Fig. 5A) , confirming that p38 MAPK pathway is important for IL-6 and IL-8 induction. Similar levels of viral RNA were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in both p38-knockdown and control cells (Fig. 5A) . However, at the protein level, less IBV S protein was detected in the knockdown cells infected with IBV at 12 h post-infection, compared to that in the control cells (Fig. 5A) .

As shown in Fig. 5B , detection of both sense and anti-sense strands of IBV gRNAs showed an inhibition of virus replication in p38 KI cells compared to WT cells, with an approximately 10-fold reduction in the production of both positiveand negative-strand gRNAs at 18 h post-infection.

Quantification by densitometry indicated a 5-fold reduction in IBV N protein synthesis in p38 KI cells compared to WT MEFs after normalization to \u03b2-tubulin. These results showed that IBV replication was impaired in p38-deficiency cells. Determination of the level of IL-6 mRNA by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed an approximately 5fold reduction in p38 KI cells (Fig. 5B ).

            "text": "The regulatory role of DUSP1 in IL-6 and IL-8 induction in IBVinfected cells was further investigated by knockdown of DUSP1. DUSP1 iRNA and non-targeting control siRNA were transiently transfected in two groups of H1299 cells followed by IBV infection in a time-course manner. As shown by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, 24-73% DUSP1-knockdown efficiencies were achieved at the mRNA level and IBV infection was minimally affected by detection of viral gRNA(+) (Fig. 6C ). As expected, induction of IL-6 and IL-8 was generally at a higher level (1.5-to 3.21-fold increase for IL-6 and 1.11-to 3.1-fold increase for IL-8) in DUSP1-knockdown cells than that in the control cells at each time point. These results collectively suggest that DUSP1 may negatively regulate the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 at late stages of virus infection. and chemokines. Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines plays an important role in the pathogenesis of virus infection, and may be regulated by the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop. The p38 MAPK is involved in numerous biological processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cytokine production. On the other hand, DUSP1 negatively regulates p38 MAPK phosphorylation and forms a feedback loop. In this study, we show that levels of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, were greatly elevated during IBV infection of cultured cells. This induction may be resulted from activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Meanwhile, DUSP1 was also stimulated to regulate the p38 MAPK activity in the late stage of viral infection. As activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and induction of IL-6 and IL-8 may have multiple pathogenic effects on the whole host as well as on individual infected cells, regulation of the p38 MAPK and DUSP1 feedback loop by IBV may modulate the pathogenesis of the virus. Further studies using avian cells, chicken embryos and young chicks would reveal more information on the functional roles of this regulatory loop in IBV-host interactions, viral replication and pathogenesis. The observation that p38 MAPK is activated in IBV-infected cells is consistent with studies in cells infected with some other coronaviruses. For example, MHV, a prototype coronavirus in group II, was able to activate the p38 MAPK pathway in the infected cells (Banerjee et al., 2002) . Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, were significantly induced by infection of primary mouse astrocytes and microglia with MHV strains JHM and A59 (Yu and Zhang, 2006) . It was also observed that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was greatly elevated in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells at 18 h post-infection (Mizutani et al., 2004) . In this study, treatment of cells either with the p38 MAPKspecific inhibitor, SB203580, or with a small interfering RNA targeting p38 MAPK almost abolished the IBV-medicated induction of IL-6 and IL-8. It was previously suggested that in MHV-infected cells, phosphorylation of eIF4E promoted by p38 MAPK may contribute to the induction of IL-6 (Banerjee et al., 2002) . However, our preliminary data did not show an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF4E in IBVinfected cells (data not shown). Based on the observation that IL-6 induction was detected at the transcriptional level in IBV-infected cells, it is unlikely that eIF4E phosphorylation is a major contributing factor in IL-6 induction by IBV infection.",

            "text": "In this study, up-regulation of DUSP1 was observed in IBV-infected cells. DUSP1 is known to be a negative regulator in the innate immune system. It is a protein phosphatase that regulates the activities of p38 MAPK and JNK, and, to a less extent, the ERK1/2 MAPK activity. It functions as a negative regulator to suppress the production of excessive cytokines and inflammatory responses (Turpeinen et al.) . In DUSP1deficient mice, increased levels of IL-6 and other cytokines were detected . Up-regulation of DUSP1 was detected in cells in response to pro-inflammatory stress stimuli, such as UV irradiation and treatment of cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 (Lasa et al., 2002; Li et al., 2001; Toh et al., 2004) . Up-regulation of DUSP1 upon infections by viruses was also reported (Abraham and Clark, 2006) . One example is the nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which could up-regulate DUSP1 (Tachado et al., 2005) . In this study, either siRNA-mediated knockdown of DUSP1 or inhibition of the DUSP1 activity by a specific inhibitor enhances and prolongs the p38 MAPK activation and the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 in IBV-infected cells. These observations imply that up-regulation of DUSP1 by IBV may be a H1299 cells were transfected with either p38 MAPK siRNA or negative control siRNA twice in a 24 h interval, and were infected with IBV 24 h after the second transfection. Cells were harvested at 0, 12, 15, and 18 h post-infection, RNA was extracted and analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using appropriate primers for detection of IL-6, IL-8, p38, IBV gRNA(+) and GAPDH. Cell lysates in the repeated experiment were also prepared and subjected to Western blot for detection of p38 MAPK, IBV S protein, and actin. The intensity of each band was determined by densitometry, normalized to GAPDH or actin, and the ratio of the corresponding band intensity in the knockdown cells (+) and the control cells (\u2212) was calculated and shown. It includes the ratios of IL-6 (IL-6/R(+/\u2212)) and IL-8 (IL-8/R(+/\u2212)) at the mRNA level, and p38 (p38/P (+/\u2212)) and IBV S (IBVS(+/\u2212)) at the protein level. (B) Requirement of functional p38 MAPK for efficient IBV replication and IL-6 induction. Wild type MEF (WT) and non-functional p38 knock-in MEF cells (p38 KI) were infected with IBV or mocked infected for 18 h. RNA was extracted and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using appropriate primers for IBV gRNA (+), IBV gRNA(\u2212), IL-6, and GAPDH. The same experiments were repeated and total proteins were analyzed by Western blot with p38, IBV N protein and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies. The intensity of each band was determined by densitometry, and was shown as fold induction after normalization to GAPDH or tubulin. viral strategy to prevent drastic activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and limit pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. The mechanisms that control the IBV-mediated up-regulation of DUSP1 await elucidation. One possibility is that some of the IBV proteins may be able to trigger its activation. Alternatively, the virus may up-regulate DUSP1 indirectly by activation of either IL-1 or TNF\u03b1, as an increase in IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 production in IBV-infected cells was also observed (unpublished observations). More systematic studies are underway to address these issues further.",

PKR may act as a major sensor of cytosolic dsRNA (Sadler and Williams, 2007; Yang et al., 1995) , and plays a role in transduction of pro-inflammatory signals by mediating the activation of dsRNA-dependent NF\u03baB (Zamanian-Daryoush et al., 2000) . However, it remains unclear whether the PKR kinase activity is directly required for signal transduction or PKR may simply function as a structural protein via interaction with other kinases and adaptor proteins. For instance, PKR was suggested to interact with TRAF6, TAK1, and TAB2 as a scaffold protein to mediate TLR3-dependent NF-\u03baB and MAPK activation (Jiang et al., 2003) . PKR was also linked to TRAF2 and TRAF5 (Gil et al., 2004) . A more recent study in human keratinocytes proposed a central role for PKR in dsRNA-mediated type , 8, 12, 16, 20 , and 24 h post-infection, respectively. Total RNA was extracted, an equal amount of total RNA was resolved on agarose gel and Northern blot was performed to detect DUSP1, IBV gRNA(+), and GAPDH using specific DIG-labled DNA probes. The intensities of DUSP1 in IBV-infected H1299 were determined by densitometry, and were shown as fold induction after normalization to GAPDH. The signal at 0 h post-infection was treated as 1. The intensities of DUSP1 were determined by densitometry, and were shown as fold induction after normalization to GAPDH. The signal at 0 h post-infection was treated as 1. (B) Effects of inhibition of the DUSP1 activity on p38 MAPK phosphorylation and IL-6 induction. H1299 cells were pre-treated with DUSP1 inhibitor (Ro 10 \u03bcM) or DMSO for 1 h prior to and during IBV infection, and harvested at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h postinfection, respectively. Total RNA was extracted and semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect IL-6, IBV gRNA(+), and GAPDH. Total proteins from repeated experiment were analyzed by Western blot with nti-p-p38, total p38 and actin antibodies. The intensities of IL-6 and p-p38 bands were determined by densitometry, and the ratios of the corresponding band intensities in the presence (+) and absence (\u2212) of the inhibitor were calculated and shown.
