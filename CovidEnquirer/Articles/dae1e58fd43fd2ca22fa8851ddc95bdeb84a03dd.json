By using an infectious cloning system developed recently for the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene, the firefly luciferase gene and several host and viral genes (eIF3f, SARS ORF6, Dengue virus 1 core protein gene) were inserted into various positions of the IBV genome, and the effects on gene expression, virus recovery, and stability in cell culture were studied. Selected viruses were also inoculated into chicken embryos for studies of foreign gene expression at different tissue level. The results demonstrated the stability of recombinant viruses depends on the intrinsic properties of the foreign gene itself as well as the position at which the foreign genes were inserted. For unstable viruses, the loss of expression of the inserted genes was found to result from a large deletion of the inserted gene and even IBV backbone sequences. This represents a promising system for development of coronavirus-based gene delivery vectors and vaccines against coronavirus and other viral infections in chicken.",

While this seems to apply particularly to DNA viruses and retroviruses, it has become clear that there might also be a role for RNA viruses. These viruses, however, are inherently more prone to genetic instability, and this might particularly be the case for coronaviruses in view of the documented high frequency of recombination (Lai, 1996) . Nevertheless, coronaviruses have been shown to accept and express foreign genes, making them attractive candidates for gene therapy vectors and vaccine development (Alonso et al., 2002; Curtis et al., 2002; de Haan et al., 2003 de Haan et al., , 2005 Enjuanes et al., 2001; Hackney et al., 2003; Ortego et al., 2002; Sola et al., 2003; Thiel et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "IBV causes an acute and contagious disease in chickens with significant impact on the poultry industry worldwide. It contains a 27.6 kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. In the virusinfected cells, six mRNA species, including the genome-length RNA (gRNA) 1 and five subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) species (mRNA 2-6), are produced by a discontinuous RNA transcription mechanism (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005) . Each mRNA species possesses a 64 nucleotides leader sequence derived from the 5 end of the genome (Boursnell et al., 1987) . Based on the current discontinuous transcription model, the leader sequence is added to the sgRNAs during transcription of the negative strand sgR-NAs by base-pairing with the transcription regulatory sequences (TRS), a highly conserved core sequence CUU(G)AACAA, in the genome (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005; Stirrups et al., 2000) . SgRNAs 2, 3, 4, and 6 encode the four structural proteins, i.e., spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), respectively. The 5 twothird region of mRNA1 comprises two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, and encodes two polyproteins. The two polyproteins are cleaved proteolytically by two virus-encoded proteinases, the papain-like and 3C-like proteinases, into 15 functional proteins (Nsp2-Nsp16) (Liu et al., 1995 (Liu et al., , 1997 Ng and Liu, 1998 Xu et al., 2001) . Compared to other coronaviruses, Nsp1 is absent in IBV but Nsp2 is considerably larger (Lim and Liu, 1998a,b; Lim et al., 2000; Liu et al., 1998) . In addition, four accessory proteins, or group-specific proteins, are encoded by ORF3a, 3b, 5a and 5b, respectively (Liu et al., 1991; Liu and Inglis, 1992) .",

Two types of coronavirus-derived expression systems were attempted (Enjuanes et al., 2001 ). The first system, the so-called helperdependent expression systems, was employed to express several heterogonous genes, such as chloramphenicol acetyltransfererase (CAT) gene, \u2424-glucuronidase (GUS) gene, green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, firefly luciferase (LUC) gene and interferon-\u2425 (IFN-\u2425) gene by using coronavirus-derived minigenomes from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HcoV-229E) and IBV (Alonso et al., 2002; Hackney et al., 2003; Izeta et al., 1997; Lin and Lai, 1993; Thiel et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 1997) . The second type of expression systems based on reverse genetics of coronaviruses permits the expression of heterogonous genes by construction of recombinant viruses carrying foreign genes in the viral genome (de Haan et al., 2003 (de Haan et al., , 2005 Le et al., 2007; Youn et al., 2005) .",

Two reporter genes, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the firefly luciferase gene, were placed under the control of a TRS sequence derived from ORF5a and inserted into different positions of the IBV genome. EGFP was also fused to four structural proteins, S, M, E and N. Recombinant viruses with variable degrees of stability and expression efficiency of the inserted foreign genes were recovered and characterized. The results showed that stable recombinant viruses were recovered when the luciferase gene was used to replace the ORF3a3b gene cluster. Recombinant IBV expressing other heterogeneous genes derived from host cells and other viruses were also recovered and efficient expression of the target genes was observed in both cultured cells and chicken embryos. This study presents a detailed assessment of using IBV for the development of gene delivery vectors and potential vaccines.",

To ensure the transcription and translation of E gene, a preceding sequence of 25 nucleotides flanking ORF5a TRS was introduced. EGFP ORF sequence was also amplified using primers 5 -cggtctctgATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG and 5 -cggtctctgttcTTATTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC. In vitro ligation of these three BsaI-digested fragments resulted in the deletion of the nucleotides 23853 to 24201 including ORF 3a and 3b and the insertion of EGEP gene at the corresponding position. To insert the EGFP gene cassette between IBV M gene and 5a5b gene, EGFP gene preceded by an IBV ORF5ab TRS and flanking sequences was amplified using the primers 5 -cgggtctcacac-ataacaaaaacttaacaaatacggacgATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG and 5 -cgggtctcacattaCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC. Primer pair IBV20884F and IBV25178R (5 -cgggtctc 25178 ATGTGTAAAGACTACTTC) was used to produce a fragment containing IBV nucleotides 20884 to 25178, while primer pair IBV25179F (5cgggtctc 25179 AAATGTGTGTGTAGAGAG) and IBV27611R was used for the amplification of a fragment containing IBV nucleotides 25179 to the 3 -end. Similarly, for the insertion of EGFP gene between the N gene and the 3 -UTR, two fragments containing IBV nucleotides from 20884 to 27107 (IBV20884F and IBV27107R 5 -cggtctc 27107 ACTCAAAGTTCATTCTCT) and 27106 to 27611(IBV27106F 5 -cggtctc 27106 GTAACATAATGGACCTGT and IBV27611R), and the EGFP gene expression cassette plus the ORF5a TRS and flanking sequences was amplified with primers (5 -cggtctcTTGAGaacaaaaacttaacaaatacggacgATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG and 5 -cggtctctgttaCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT). A BsaI site was introduced at both ends of all fragments. All amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pCR-TOPO-XL (Invitrogen) or pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and verified by sequencing. Plasmids were then digested with BsaI, and fragments of interest were purified. In vitro ligation of BsaI-digested fragments would result in the insertion of EGFP gene expression cassette between nucleotides 25180 and 25181, 27105 and 27106. The same strategies were employed for constructing recombinant viruses expressing the firefly luciferase gene and other foreign genes using various genespecific primers. Briefly, three fragments containing luciferase gene were amplified with primer pairs: 5 -cgggtctctgATGGAAGACG-CCAAAAACAT and 5 -cgggtctcTGTTCACACGGCGATCTTTCCGCCCT; 5 -cgggtctcacacataacaaaaacttaacaaatacggacgATGGAAGACGCCAA-AAACAT and 5 -cgggtctcACATTACACGGCGATCTTTCCGCCCT; and 5 -cgggtctcTTGAGaacaaaaacttaacaaatacggacgATGGAAGACGCCAAAA-ACAT and 5 -cggtctctgttaCACGGCGATCTTTCC, respectively. The luciferase gene was introduced separately into IBV genome at different positions: replacing 3a3b gene, insertion between nucleotides 25180 and 25181 and between nucleotides 27105 and 27106, resulting in the production of three recombinant viruses IBV-Luc 3a3b, IBV-Luc25180 and IBV-Luc27105, respectively. The amplified ORF6 of SARS-CoV Sin2774 (GenBank accession no. AY283798) (5 -cgggtctcacacataacaaaaacttaacaaatacggacgATGTTTCATCTTGTTGAC and 5 -cgggtctcacattaTGGATAATCTAACTC) and core gene of Dengue virus 1 (5 -cgggtctcTTGAG-aacaaaaacttaacaaatacggacgATGAACAACCAACGAAAAAAGAC and 5 -cggtctctgttaCGCCAAGGCTGTGGGCAGCAG) were inserted separately between nucleotides 25180 and 25181 and between nucleotides 27105 and 27106, while the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3f (eIF3f) amplified with primers (5 -cgggtctctg ATGGCCACACCGGCGGTACC and 5 -cgggtctctgtTCACAGGTTTACAAGTTTTTC) was introduced into IBV genome by replacing 3a3b. The recovered recombinant viruses were designated IBV-SARS6, IBV-DenC and IBV-eIF3f, respectively. In addition, constructs IBV-S-EGFP, IBV-EGFP-E, IBV-M-EGFP, IBV-EGFP-M and IBV-N-EGFP were made by insertion of EGFP gene between nucleotides 23850 and 23851, 24505 and 24506, 25177 and 25178, 24505 and 24506, 27102 and 27103, respectively, resulting in the expression of EGEP fused with these structural proteins.",

For both IBV-EGFP25180 and IBV-EGFP27105, Northern blot analysis clearly demonstrated the presence of an extra sgRNA (marked by an asterisk) initiated by the inserted artificial TRS sequences. However, EGFP expression could not be observed in cells infected with passage 5 onwards (data not shown). RT-PCR and sequencing analysis revealed that the complete EGFP coding sequence together with 46 nucleotides (from 27104 to 27150) located upstream of the 3 -UTR was lost in cells infected with passage 5 of the plaque-purified IBV-EGFP27105 (Fig. 2d) . The remaining 11-nucleotide sequence (dashed box) represented the partial core sequence of the inserted TRS (with GAACAA), implying that template switching between neighboring identical TRS sequences might take place during virus propagation and resulted in deletion of the EGFP reporter gene. In cells infected with IBV-S-EGFP, the 3 region of sgRNA2 was shown to contain the EGFP gene of RT-PCR analysis, as demonstrated by a 0.7 kb increase in size when compared to wild type virus (Fig. 2c) . The virus was stable at least up to passage 5.",

In IBV-Luc 3a3b, the luciferase gene was used to replace the group-specific gene cluster ORF3a3b, and the ORF5a TRS was added upstream of the E gene to restore its transcription and expression after interruption of the IRES sequence due to ORF3a3b replacement (Fig. 3a) .

To analyze the growth property and stability of this virus in detail, plaque-purified virus was passaged serially and total RNA was isolated from Vero cells infected with different passages (P4-P7) in a parallel experiment and subjected to Northern blot analysis. The expected size increases in sgRNAs 2, but not sgRNA 4-6 were observed when compared to wild type control (Fig. 3b, left panel) .

Northern blot analysis of cells infected with passage 2 of IBV-Luc25180 clearly demonstrated a decrease in size of sgRNA3 and sgRNA4, implying that the luciferase gene cassette was lost when the virus was propagated in cultured cells (Fig. 3c) . To analyze further the genetic basis of this instability, RT-PCR and sequencing analysis of the luciferase insertion region revealed that the entire luciferase gene together with a 287-nucleotide-long IBV genomic sequence (from 25181 to 25467) was deleted while leaving the original ORF5a and its TRS sequences intact (Fig. 3c) . This finding was concordant with the observation that the luciferase activity was lost in cells infected with passage 2 of IBV-luc25180, whereas the virus started to replicate to higher titers (data not shown). It also implied that the deleted IBV genomic sequence (from 25181 to 25467) was dispensable for virus replication. Western blot analysis showed similar amounts of accumulation of the S protein in cells infected with the deletion mutant virus (D) and wild type virus in a time course experiment (Fig. 3c) . The same RT-PCR strategy was employed to analyze IBV-Luc27105. In cells infected with passage 2 of IBV-Luc27105, the luciferase activity fell suddenly and no full-length RT-PCR fragment was amplified from cells infected with passage 3 of the same recombinant virus. Instead, a 1 kb PCR fragment, which is the same size as the RT-PCR fragment amplified from cells infected with wild type virus, was detected, suggesting that the luciferase gene was lost. Sequencing analysis of the PCR fragment confirmed that only 14 nucleotides from the inserted luciferase gene cassette were left (Fig. 3d) .",

The foreign genes were inserted at the position either between M and ORF 5a or downstream of the N gene, and infectious recombinant viruses were recovered after electroporation of the in vitro transcribed full-length RNA into Vero cells. Infection of Vero cells with recombinant IBV carrying the SARS-CoV gene 6 or eIF3f showed efficient expression of the two proteins (Fig. 4A) . The two viruses were stable up to passage 5 in Vero cells (data not shown). In cells infected with the recombinant virus carrying the dengue virus core protein, efficient expression of the protein was also detected (Fig. 4b) . However, the virus was much less stable when propagated in the cultured cells. In cells infected with the passage 3 virus, full-length core protein and a more rapidly migrating core protein band, probably representing a product encoded by the partially deleted core gene, were detected (Fig. 4b, lane 4) . In cells infected with passage 4 of the virus, the full-length core protein was barely detected (Fig. 4b, lane 5) .

            "text": "Coronavirus possesses several attractive traits as a potential gene delivery system. First, as an RNA virus, it replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of the infected cells without a DNA stage, making integration of viral sequence into the host genome unlikely. Second, it is the largest RNA virus with a genome size of around 30 kb and a cloning capacity of more than 6 kb is therefore expected (Enjuanes et al., 2005) . Third, coronavirus displays a unique transcription process involving transcription of a nested set of 6-8 subgenomic mRNA species. Heterologous genes can be expressed simply by inserting them with an appropriate TRS into the virus genome, as demonstrated for MHV (Fischer et al., 1998) , SARS-CoV (Sims et al., 2005) and IBV (Le et al., 2007; Youn et al., 2005) . Fourth, coronavirus host specificity and tropism could be altered readily by exchange of the S gene between viruses of different host origin (Casais et al., 2003; Sanchez et al., 1997) . Therefore, it is possible to engineer the tissue and species tropism to target expression to different organs and animal species, including humans. Fifth, it may be used to express multiple genes, as demonstrated by the possibility of constructing coronavirus-based HIV multigene vaccine (Eriksson et al., 2006; Thiel et al., 2003) . Finally, the mucosal route is the natural way of coronavirus transmission. In this study, efforts were made to explore the possibility of developing coronavirus IBV as gene delivery vectors and multivalent vaccines. In this study, a number of infectious recombinant IBV carrying foreign genes with variable degrees of genetic stability were obtained by insertion of reporter genes or host and other viral genes at different positions of the IBV genome. Several of these recombinant viruses could be potential vaccine candidates and useful tools for studying the molecular and cellular biology of coronavirus.",

            "text": "This study demonstrated that genetic stability of recombinant IBV carrying foreign genes depends on the size and the intrinsic property of the inserted genes as well as the genomic locations at which they are inserted. It is likely that foreign genes may contain sequences that make them more susceptible to mutation or recombination during coronavirus replication. For example, instability caused by the firefly luciferase in recombinant MHV might the associated with its high GC content (46.7%) when compared to the coronavirus genome (MHV, 41.8%; FIPV, 38.1%) (de Haan et al., 2005) . Indeed, it was shown for poliovirus vectors that manipulation of the G/C contents increased the genetic stability of foreign inserts (Lee et al., 2002) . In contrast, the EGFP gene with a G/C content of 61-64% was stably maintained in the recombinant virus IBV-EGFP27105 genome, as shown in this study. Previous studies also described stable expression of GFP after its insertion into TGEV and MHV (Curtis et al., 2002; Fischer et al., 1998) . Foreign inserts may also contain RNA secondary structures, which are prone to undergo RNA recombination, as recombination was demonstrated to occur more frequently at regions of predicted RNA secondary structure in the MHV S gene (Rowe et al., 1997) . Recombination events within a foreign gene may also be dependent on the degree of base paring between the foreign gene and the virus genome sequence (Lai, 1996) . In addition, the molar ratio of the genuine coronavirus sgRNAs and their encoded proteins could be disturbed after insertion of foreign gene (de Haan et al., 2003) Apart from viral mutation and recombination rates, the selective advantage of variants newly emerged during propagation of the recombinant viruses is also an important determinant for the instability of the recombinant viruses. In this study, a key phenomenon observed for all unstable recombinant viruses was that loss of foreign genes was accompanied inevitably by increasing viral titre (data not shown). It was hypothesized that recombinant viruses carrying full-length foreign genes appear to have a replicative disadvantage than those with deletion or recombination, hence are less favourably selected when propagated in cultured cells.",

Expression of the reporter genes decreased when the virus was propagated serially in cultured cells and the expression became eventually undetectable in subsequent passages. This was accompanied by gradual deletion of the inserted foreign gene and even intergenic IBV backbone sequences. When the reporter genes were inserted downstream of the N gene, expression of EGFP could be observed in serial passages for IBV-EGFP27105 in cultured cells, but the luciferase activity was decreased as early as at the second passage of IBV-Luc27105, implying that this position was at least not stable for the luciferase gene. When GFP gene was inserted into the equivalent position of the TGEV genome, a highly unstable virus was obtained , and attempts to insert GFP at the same position of the MHV genome did not result in a viable virus (Hsue and Masters, 1997) .",

(2002) demonstrated stable EGFP expression in TGEV replicon particles. Recombinant MHV expressing EGFP was also reported to be stable when it was used to monitor the virus spread in vitro as well as in the mouse central nervous system (Sarma et al., 2002) . In a previous study by Sola et al. (2003) , recombinant TGEV engineered by replacing ORF3a3b with GFP led to efficient (>40 g/10 6 cells) and stable (>20 passages) expression of GFP. A stable recombinant FIPV expressing the Renilla luciferase was also made by replacing the nonessential group-specific gene cluster, ORF3abc (de Haan et al., 2005) . Although the functions of IBV ORF3a/3b encoded proteins remain to be elucidated, studies based on IBV and other coronaviruses demonstrated that deletion of such group-specific ORFs did not influence dramatically the replication efficiency or viral RNA synthesis in cell culture, and may even play little role in in vivo replication (Casais et al., 2005; Haijiema et al., 2004; Hodgeson et al., 2006; Ortego et al., 2003; Yount et al., 2005) . This possibly explains the stable expression of luciferase observed in cells infected by IBV-Luc 3a3b.",
