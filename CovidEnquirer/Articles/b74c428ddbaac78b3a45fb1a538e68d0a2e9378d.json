We evaluated the safety, tolerability, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two intranasal, live-attenuated HPIV3 vaccines, designated rHPIV3-N B and rB/HPIV3, that were cDNA-derived chimeras of HPIV3 and bovine PIV3 (BPIV3). These were evaluated in adults, HPIV3 seropositive children, and HPIV3 seronegative children. A total of 112 subjects participated in these studies. Both rB/HPIV3 and rHPIV3-N B were highly restricted in replication in adults and seropositive children but readily infected seronegative children, who shed mean peak virus titers of 10 2.8 vs. 10 3.7 pfu/mL, respectively. Although rB/HPIV3 was more restricted in replication in seronegative children than rHPIV3-N B , it induced significantly higher titers of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies against HPIV3. Taken together, these data suggest that the rB/HPIV3 vaccine is the preferred candidate for further clinical development.",

Like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), HPIV3 can cause bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia and apnea in infants and has been associated with wheezing episodes in older children with asthma [4, 5, [7] [8] [9] . Although precise estimates do not exist, the outpatient burden of HPIV3 is likely substantial, since the number of emergency room and outpatient visits for HPIV3-associated illness may exceed hospitalizations by 10-80fold [4, 6] . Since approximately two-thirds of HPIV3 hospitalizations occur in the first year of life [4, 6] , development of a vaccine capable of inducing protective immunity in infancy is urgently needed.",

Since the immunogenicity of vaccines administered during the first few months of life is typically less than that observed in older children, more than one dose of an HPIV3 vaccine would likely be needed to induce lasting protective immunity in infants and children [10, 11, 14, 15] . Serum antibody responses to the surface antigens of HPIV3, namely the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, are recognized correlates of protective immunity [7, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The roles of other aspects of host immunity in protective responses against HPIV3 are not well understood, particularly in the pediatric population.",

More recently, the tolerability, level of attenuation, and immunogenicity of a cDNA-derived recombinant version of cp45, designated rcp45, was shown to be comparable to what was previously observed with the biologically derived cp45 vaccine [11a] . The use of cDNA-derived virus has the advantage of a short, well-characterized passage history as well as the ability to readily regenerate and modify the virus as needed.",

BPIV3 has evolved in bovines and is restricted for replication in humans, i.e., it exhibits a host-range phenotype. BPIV3 has been shown to be well-tolerated and attenuated in adults, children, and infants as young as one month of age [10, 21] . However, cross-neutralization studies have demonstrated that the BPIV3 HN and F proteins are only 25% antigenically related to the HPIV3 HN and F, and antibody responses to HPIV3 in children administered BPIV3 have been suboptimal [10, 21, 22] . For this reason, cDNA-derived chimeric viruses have been developed that contain the HN and F genes of HPIV3 in a backbone containing one or more BPIV3 genes. The purpose of this strategy is to combine the antigenic specificity of the HPIV3 HN and F glycoproteins with the host range restriction of BPIV3.",

In the present study, we evaluated one example of each of these types of chimeric human/bovine PIV3 vaccines in clinical trials. In rHPIV3-N B , the HPIV3 nucleocapsid (N) gene was replaced by its BPIV3 counterpart; the rest of the genome is HPIV3. In contrast, rB/HPIV3 consists of BPIV3 in which the HN and F genes were replaced by their HPIV3 counterparts. In previous studies, both rHPIV3-N B and rB/HPIV3 were found to be attenuated in nonhuman primates and to induce higher titers of antibody to the HPIV3 HN than were induced by BPIV3 [20, [23] [24] [25] .

We and others previously evaluated BPIV3 as a live-attenuated vaccine against HPIV3 and found that it was well-tolerated and highly infectious in HPIV3 seronegative children and infants as young as 2 months of age [10, 21] . In the majority of children over 6 months of age, experimental BPIV3 vaccines also elicited serum HAI antibody responses to the BPIV3 HN glycoprotein, the major viral protective antigen; however, very few of these children developed high titers of antibody to the HPIV3 HN. This result was consistent with cross-neutralization studies that demonstrated only 25% antigenic relatedness between BPIV3 and HPIV3 HN and F [28, 29] , and suggested that inclusion of the HN and F glycoproteins from HPIV3 would be important for induction of antibodies against these protective antigens. In this study, we describe the evaluation of two experimental chimeric bovine-human PIV3 vaccines. Each of these vaccines contains the HN and F glycoproteins of HPIV3. rHPIV3-N B is a single gene substitution recombinant in which the only contribution from BPIV3 is the N gene and its encoded protein, whereas rB/HPIV3 contains all of the internal genes from BPIV3, and only the F and HN genes and encoded proteins from HPIV3. rHPIV3-N B and rB/HPIV3 were previously evaluated in rhesus monkeys [20, 23, 25] . Replication of these chimeric viruses in nonhuman primates was comparable: each replicated in the upper respiratory tract to a level that was intermediate between the parent wt BPIV3 strain and wt HPIV3, and each was highly restricted in the lower respiratory tract, similar to BPIV3 [20, 23, 25] . Interestingly, however, replication of these two experimental vaccines differed in HPIV3 seronegative children. In our study, the mean peak titer of virus detected in nasal wash fluid was greater for rHPIV3-N B than for rB/HPIV3 (10 3.7 vs. 10 2.8 pfu/mL), and the mean duration of shedding was significantly greater for rHPIV3-N B than for rB/HPIV3 (14.7 vs. 8.2 days). At a dose of 10 5.0 TCID 50 , rHPIV3-N B was slightly less restricted in replication in HPIV3 seronegative children than the parental BPIV3 (mean peak titer 10 3.2 TCID 50 ; mean duration shedding 10.7 days [21] ). While replication of both rHPIV3-N B and rB/HPIV3 was restricted compared to what we have previously observed in children naturally infected with wt HPIV3 [11] , this study underscores the need for careful stepwise evaluation in susceptible pediatric populations to uncover subtle differences that may not be apparent when these viruses are evaluated in nonhuman primates.",

The reasons for this apparent difference are unclear. One potential explanation for this observation might be that the BPIV3-specific accessory P gene products encoded by the rB/HPIV3 vaccine are less able to inhibit human interferon induction and signaling than are the HPIV3-specific P gene products encoded by the rHPIV3-N B vaccine. Greater interferon production and signaling in response to the rB/HPIV3 vaccine might have adjuvant effects resulting in a stronger antibody response, as has been noted in bovines infected with bovine RSV mutants that differed in their ability to control the host interferon response [30] . In any case, the combination of greater restriction in replication with increased antibody response makes the rB/HPIV3 vaccine a more promising candidate than the rHPIV3-N B vaccine. The titer of antibody achieved in HPIV3 seronegative children after a single dose of rB/HPIV3 vaccine was only slightly lower than that measured in seropositive children who had presumably experienced prior infection with wt HPIV3 (Table 2) , and, since more than one dose of this vaccine would likely be administered [31] , it is possible than antibody titers comparable to infection with wt HPIV3 might be achieved following completion of a vaccination series with rB/HPIV3.",

These types of illnesses often occur in infants and preschoolers and can confound the assessment of reactogenicity of a live-attenuated respiratory virus vaccine. In particular, assessing the causal relationship between vaccine administration and a mild illness such as rhinorrhea will require studies in larger numbers of children: for example, the association between the live-attenuated influenza vaccine FluMist and mild upper respiratory symptoms was not apparent until large-scale studies were completed [32] .

            "text": "In summary, we have shown that two chimeric bovine-human PIV3 viruses are restricted in replication in HPIV3 seronegative children. Of the two vaccines, rB/HPIV3 appears to be both more restricted in replication and more immunogenic, making it the preferred candidate for further clinical development. Currently, a live-attenuated HPIV3 vaccine (cp45 and the recombinant version, rcp45) has been shown to be highly attenuated, infectious and immunogenic in phase I and II clinical trials in HPIV3-na\u00efve infants and children [11, 33, 34] . rB/HPIV3 represents a potential additional live-attenuated investigational HPIV3 vaccine that could be evaluated in phase II/III studies. Alternatively, rB/HPIV3 could be used to express the surface glycoproteins of related paramyxoviruses that are important pediatric pathogens, such as RSV or human metapneumovirus [35] . Evaluation of a similar chimeric B/HPIV3 vaccine virus expressing the RSV F protein from an added gene is currently in progress [36] .",

For each vaccine, studies were performed sequentially in adults, HPIV3 seropositive children, and HPIV3 seronegative children. A dose-escalation study was performed in the seronegative cohorts of children receiving rHPIV3-NB because the vaccine was insufficiently infectious at a dose of 10 5 TCID50.
