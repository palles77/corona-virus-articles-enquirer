            "text": "Porcine monomyeloid cell lines were established following transfection of primary porcine alveolar macrophage cultures with plasmid pSV3neo, carrying genes for neomycin resistance and SV40 large T antigen. The parental clone 3D4 exhibited a relatively rapid doubling time (25.5 h), high plating efficiency and mixed phenotype with respect to growth on a solid support. Single cell cloning of the 3D4 parent resulted in establishment of several cell lines; three of them designated 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 were selected for further characterization. All three clones supported the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), swine poxvirus, African swine fever virus (ASFV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), parainfluenza virus, bovine adenovirus (BAV), vaccinia virus (VV), and porcine adenovirus (PAV). Under the conditions tested the cells did not support replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The swine myeloid character was confirmed for all three clones by fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis using monoclonal antibodies 74-22-15 and DH59B, which recognize the pan-myeloid antigen cluster SWC3a. A subpopulation of each cell line was positive for nonspecific esterase activity and phagocytic activity to varying degrees depending on the media formulation. Cells from all three lines exhibited anchorage dependent growth when maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 -15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and nonessential amino acids. Propagation in commercially formulated serum free media resulted in colony formation and growth in suspension. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to serum free media restored cell attachment. DMSO was also able to induce expression of CD14 monocyte marker in the 3D4/31 cell line maintained in FBS containing medium, as determined by FACS with monoclonal antibody CAM36A. Supplementation of RPMI medium with 10% porcine serum upregulated the expression of CD14 and induced expression of porcine macrophage markers recognized by antibodies 2B10 and 2G6 (Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 74 (2000) 163) in all three cell lines. The porcine myelomonocytic cell lines obtained may have a wide variety of applications in porcine virology and immunology.",

            "text": "Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are important effectors and regulators of the immune response and also serve as target cells for replication of a number of viruses. Their infection can thus play an important role in the pathogenesis of a number of viral diseases. For example, macrophages are the only target cells for porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Rossow, 1998) and are the primary targets for African swine fever virus (ASFV) (Malmquist and Hay, 1960; Minguez et al., 1988) . A number of other viruses that infect pigs, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1) (Mc Neilly et al., 1996) , and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) (Morozov et al., 1998; Kiupel et al., 1998) also replicate in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. Work was initiated to establish an immortalized porcine monocyte/macrophage cell line that could be used for propagation and study of selected porcine viruses. The availability of such a cell line would facilitate the isolation and study of these viruses by eliminating reliance on primary cell cultures, difficult to establish and standardize. For example, field strains of PRRSV and ASFV are currently isolated using porcine primary macrophages which are not only difficult to establish but cannot be frozen reliably for long term storage and use. More importantly, it has been shown that the phenotype of porcine monocytic cells at the time of isolation can be heterogeneous (McCullough et al., 1993) which, in turn, may effect the efficiency of ASFV replication. In order to overcome these difficulties, a combination of porcine alveolar macrophages and MA-104 cells has been recommended for the isolation of PRRSV (Benfield et al., 1999) . A continuous porcine monocytic cell line with the potential to differentiate into macrophage type cells, would also be a valuable tool for viral pathogenesis and immune function studies. For these reasons, we sought to develop a continuous porcine monocyte/macrophage cell line and to determine its susceptibility to selected viruses.",

Their apparent loss of contact inhibition as demonstrated by formation of multilayer ridges and their viability after storage in liquid nitrogen at intermittent passage levels also support the argument that they are immortalized. Although the cells were resistant to high doses of the selective antibiotic G418 for a prolonged period of time when compared to immortalized porcine fibroblasts (Choi et al., 1990) , the expression of the SV40 large T-antigen gene was not confirmed, suggesting that an alternative mechanism may account for the immortalization. Preliminary screening of the cells by electron microscopy for the presence of adventitious viruses, especially those with oncogenic potential, did not reveal virus like particles. Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanism of immortalization.",

The addition of porcine serum to the culture media appeared to have the most pronounced effect on the cells based on growth characteristics and marker expression. However their sensitivity, based on GFP-reporter system (Pasick et al., 2002) , to the field strain of ASFV-Lillie did not change, indicating that the differentiation of the continuous porcine alveolar monocyte cell lines did not reach a level of maturation necessary for satisfactory replication of field isolates of ASFV (Natale and McCullough, 1998) . Two other findings suggest that the 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 cells reached only intermediate state of differentiation in porcine serum: (1) high level of CD14 expression on their surface which is an indicator of monocyte-type cells (McCullough et al., 1997) ; and (2) relatively high proportion of the 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 cells displaying non-specific esterase activity . Markers SWC1 and SWC9 will be used along Fig. 4 . Virus susceptibility of the continuous porcine myelomonocytic cell lines 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 in 7.5% FBS/RPMI, compare to the susceptibility of standard assay cells: 3D4/2 (dotted column), 3D4/21 (white), 3D4/31 (dashed), standard assay cells (black column). Panel A illustrates results when cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated overnight in RPMI containing 15% FBS. The maintenance medium was then replaced with 10-fold dilutions of various virus stocks made in RPMI and incubated with the cells for 3 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . After the adsorption period, the virus inoculum was removed and cells were washed once with RPMI and overlayed with their respective maintenance medium containing 7.5% of FBS. Cells were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 and then either fixed for immunostaining (ASFV, CSFV) or evaluated for the degree of cytopathic effect (CPE) (SVDV, VSV, PRV). In the case of cells infected with SwPV, the infected cell supernatant was titrated using a susceptible cell line (ST). Panel B illustrates results when viruses were successively passed twice in each of the three cell lines and the supernatants from the second passage were then titrated (10-fold dilutions) on previously determined, susceptible cell lines along with the original virus inoculum. Infection of the IPAM cell clones was carried out by incubating a 0.5 ml cell suspension (2 \u00d710 5 cells/ml) made in RPMI containing 7.5% FBS with 0.5 ml of virus inoculum in a 12-well plate for 5 days at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Prior to preparing the cell suspension, the IPAM cell clones were maintained in the above medium containing 15% FBS. cient to ensure replication of PRRSV and satisfactory replication of field isolates of ASFV.

The argument that the PMA was the primary differentiating agent in the PMA formulations (Tsuchiya et al., 1982) , was supported by our experiments. Addition of PMA increased the proportion of cells displaying non-specific esterase and phagocytic activities in all three clones, however, it did not change cell culture morphology, Table 3 Effect of culture media formulation on ASFV replication in continuous porcine monocyte/macrophage clones 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 in comparison to standard cell culture systems ASFV-Lisbon 61 (titer log 10) Medium/supplement ASFV-Lillie (titer log 10) with the CD14 and non-specific esterase activity to characterize cell differentiation in future work. Addition of DMSO increased the proportion of cells displaying non-specific esterase activity in all three clones, upregulated the expression of CD14 in clone 3D4/31, and interestingly improved the capability of clone 3D4/21 to replicate the field isolate of ASFV/Lillie compare to the other clones. The best, but not optimal, conditions for replication of field isolate of ASFV in the immortalized macrophages were thus in clone 3D4/21 in the RPMI medium containing 10% FBS/1% DMSO (titer 10 5 compare to 10 6.5 in PBMC).",

It was demonstrated that under specific conditions they differentiated into cells having the characteristics of those at an intermediate stage of maturation. The cells supported replication of wide range of viruses, and may have the potential to support replication of monocytotropic viruses, which require mature-type cells for replication. Although the three cell lines have similar characteristics, they differ in the degree they support replication of some viruses, and in the degree they respond to differentiating agents. The ease of manipulation of these cells and the above mentioned biological characteristics make them potentially suitable for viral diagnostic and immunopathology applications.",
