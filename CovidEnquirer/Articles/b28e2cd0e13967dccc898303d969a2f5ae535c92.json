The activity of 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside and 6-chloropurine riboside against hepatitis C virus (HCV) 1 and SARS coronavirus (SARS Co-V) 2 has already been demonstrated. Moreover, the antitumoral activity of 6-chloropurine riboside has been assayed on leukemic cells. 3 Nucleoside analogues are principally synthesized by chemical methods. Such methods require organic solvents, multiple reaction steps and the removal of protective groups, yielding undesirable racemic mixtures, 4 decreasing conversion and affecting product purification. However, biocatalysis emerged as an alternative to these drawbacks owing to its high catalytic efficiency, inherent selectivity and simple downstream processing. Biosynthesis of 6-modified purine nucleosides by transglycosylation using microorganisms was previously reported. 5 These reactions can be performed stereo-selectively by nucleoside phosphorylase (NP) enzymes. 6 Thermophilic microorganisms are a source of enzymes with extreme stability. 7 The application of these microorganisms as biocatalysts is attractive for industrial bioprocesses.",

Lower yields of 6ChPurdRib productivity were obtained when equimolar quantities of substrates were used. Productivity was 0.63 mM/h when 2:6 mM ratio (6ChPur/dUrd) was evaluated. However, when an excess of 6-halogenated base was tested (6:2 mM ratio), 6ChPurdRib productivity was increased significantly (0.9 mM/h). Biosynthesis of 6ChPurdRib at different growth stages. G. stearothermophilus was grown at 55\u00b0C in media contained 10 g/L meat peptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl and 4 g/L glucose at pH 7, and 1 \u00c2 10 10 CFU were collected at several times.
