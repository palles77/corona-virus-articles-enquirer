Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over-and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package and has already been used successfully in several notable structural studies.",

            "text": "Single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a rapidly advancing technique for determining high resolution 3D structures of proteins and protein complexes. There are several reasons that cryo-EM has become a tool of choice for recent structural biology projects [5] , but key among them is the fact that cryo-EM can be used to study classes of proteins for which other techniques (e.g., X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance) are not effective. These include membrane proteins, proteins larger than \u223c30kDa with multiple conformational states, or with flexible or disordered domains. In all of these cases, the proteins are composed of regions with varying structural properties. Membrane proteins in particular are often encapsulated in detergent micelles or lipid nanodiscs, creating a large disordered region of density around the hydrophobic region of the protein. Despite the common occurrence of such spatial variability, most state-of-the-art 3D refinement algorithms are based on the mathematical assumption of uniformity (rigidity) of the particle. This paper formulates a cross-validation regularization framework for single particle cryo-EM refinement, one that explicitly provides for the spatial inhomogeneity generated by various physical phenomena (disorder, motion, occupancy, etc) found in a typical molecular complex. Our proposed framework incorporates general domain knowledge about proteins, without specific knowledge of any particular molecule. Within this framework we derive a novel refinement algorithm, called non-uniform refinement, that accounts for structural variability, while taking care to ensure that the algorithm retains favourable statistical properties for validation and that it does not introduce avenues for over-fitting during 3D reconstruction.",

According to the model, the unobserved protein structure, represented by a 3D density, is rotated by a 3D pose and projected along the direction of the electron beam. The resulting 2D projection is translated in the plane, modulated by the microscope CTF, and corrupted by additive noise, under a certain noise model. The 3D density map m is typically parameterized as a real-space 3D array with density at each voxel, in a Cartesian grid of box size N , and a corresponding discrete Fourier representation,m = F m. The goal of reconstruction is to infer the unobserved 3D densities of the voxel array, called model parameters. Representing the 3D density, 2D projections, observed images, and the noise model in the Fourier domain is common practice for computational efficiency, exploiting the well-known convolution and Fourier-slice theorems [1, 12, 22, 26] . The unobserved pose variables for each image are latent variables.",

In cryo-EM, and more generally in inverse problems with noisy, partial observations, a critical component that modulates the quality of the results is regularization. Regularization, in intuitive terms, refers to the inclusion of prior knowledge to help penalize model complexity and avoid over-fitting. In cryo-EM refinement it plays a key role in mitigating the effects of noise, so that signal alone is used to infer model parameters. One can regularize problems explicitly, using a prior distribution over model parameters, or implicitly, by applying a regularization operator to the model parameters during optimization. Iterative refinement methods tend to use implicit regularizers, attenuating noise in the reconstructed map at each iteration. In either case, the separation of signal from noise is the crux of many inference problems.",

            "text": "In the cryo-EM refinement problem, like many latent variable inverse problems, there is an additional interplay between regularization, noise buildup, and the estimation of latent variables. Retained noise due to under-regularization will contaminate the estimation of latent variables. This contamination is propagated to subsequent iterations and causes over-fitting. In Fig. 1 , with the TRPA1 membrane protein [21] , over-fitting occurs in the disordered micelle and in the dynamic tail at the bottom of the protein. Conversely, over-regularization attenuates useful signal structure, further degrading latent variable estimates. With TRPA1, signal loss occurs in the central region where the structure is not as well resolved as it otherwise could be. In general, the amount of regularization (or smoothing) depends on a set of regularization parameters, the tuning of which is often critical to successful outcomes. This paper reconsiders the task of regularization based on the observation that common iterative refinement algorithms often systematically under-fit and over-fit different regions of a 3D structure, simultaneously. This causes a loss of resolvable detail in some parts of a structure, and accumulation of noise in others. The reason stems from the use of frequency-space filtering as a form of regularization. Some programs, like cisTEM [11] , use a strict resolution cutoff, beyond which Fourier amplitudes are set to zero before alignment of particle images to the current 3D structure. In RELION [27] , regularization was initially formulated with an explicit Gaussian prior on Fourier amplitudes of the 3D structure, with a hand-tuned parameter that controls Fourier amplitude shrinkage. Later versions of RELION [28] and cryoSPARC's homogeneous (uniform) refinement [22] use a transfer function (or Wiener filter) determined by Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) computed between two independent half-maps (e.g., [3, 13, 25] ).",

In CV, observed data are randomly partitioned into a training set and a held-out validation set. Model parameters are inferred using the training data, the quality of which is then assessed by measuring an error function applied to the validation data. In k-fold CV, the observations are partitioned into k parts. In each of k trials, one part is selected as the held-out validation set, and the remaining k \u2212 1 parts comprise the training set. The per-trial validation errors are summed, providing the total CV error. This procedure measures agreement between the optimized model and the observations, without bias due to over-fitting. Rather, over-fitting during training is detected directly as an increase in the validation error. Importantly, formulating regularization in a cross-validation setting provides a principled way to design regularization operators that are more complex than the conventional, isotropic frequency-space filters. The CV framework is not restricted to a Fourier basis. One may consider more complex parameterizations, the use of meta-parameters, and incorporate cryo-EM domain knowledge.",

As such, the 1 Two key factors directly influence the choice of \u03c1(x) for estimating \u03b8(x) reliably. The first is noise in the raw reconstruction. Aggregating squared error measures the residual variance (the residual power); larger windows provide more accurate variance estimates. The second is residual signal structure. When over-regularized, some high-frequency signal is lost, in which case signal residual is expected to have significant amplitudes near the wavelength \u03b8. (Higher frequencies with insignificant amplitudes are dominated by noise, while lower frequencies are left unchanged by the regularizer and thus cancel the signal in the opposite halfmap.) Integrating a squared band-pass signal provides a phase-independent measure of the local signal power; in our case the minimum window \u03c1(x) is determined by pass-band of the residual signal, which is expected to be close to \u03b8. Thus the minimum \u03c1(x) is naturally constrained to be small multiple of \u03b8. The same reconstruction is shown after uniform isotropic filtering (based on FSC between half-maps). Right: The same half-map reconstruction after non-uniform regularization with the optimal CV regularizer. Non-uniform regularization removes noise from the solvent background and nanodisc region, while preserving the high-resolution structure needed for particle alignments in the well-ordered protein region.

Most importantly, non-uniform refinement uses Eqn. 6 to define the optimal parameters with which to regularize each half-set reconstruction at each refinement iteration.

In addition, the lipid nanodisc (\u223c50kDa) around PfCRT accounts for a large fraction of the total particle molecular weight. It is precisely in cases like this that the nonuniform refinement strategy is critical, as larger disordered regions leave more room for over-and underregularization to influence particle alignments. For PfCRT in particluar, Fig. 4B shows substantial changes in particle alignments between uniform and non-uniform refinement. Most particle images exhibit pose changes of more than 6 degrees, indicating that regularization has a large impact on alignment. It also indicates that a large fraction of particle images may have been grossly misaligned by uniform refinement. Figure 4D shows in detail the quality of the non-uniform refinement map for PfCRT. Transmembrane \u03b1-helices can be directly traced, including side-chains.

As in [33] , we detected two discrete conformational states corresponding to the active and inactive states of the channel. 130,982 particles were found in the inactive state, and the remaining 300,759 were found to be in the active state. We obtained state-of-the-art resolution reconstructions for both the active and inactive states, but here we focus solely on the active state.",

It does, however, have other regions that are disordered or flexible, namely, a central 4-helix bundle, peripheral transmembrane domains, and the Fabs. Notably, non-uniform refinement handles these regions of the structure automatically along with the micelle, and therefore still delivers improved resolution and map quality. Figure 6A shows FSC curves from uniform and nonuniform refinement. Uniform refinement already reaches a 3.4\u00c5 resolution, and non-uniform refinement further improves this to 3.1\u00c5. Figure 6C shows 3D density maps colored by local resolution. With nonuniform refinement, map quality is clearly improved in central transmembrane regions, while flexible parts of the structure (membrane \u03b1-helices closest to the micelle, Fab domains, and 4-helix bundle) remain at intermediate resolutions. Figure 6B shows changes in particle alignment poses and shifts between the two refinement types. These changes are smaller on average than the other examples, congruent with the smaller changes in map features. Figure 6D shows three selected regions from the density maps along with a docked atomic model (PDB-6N4Q [33] ). In \u03b1-helices farther from the center of the protein (left, center), improvement in map quality is readily apparent, with many side chains being somewhat buildable in the uniform refinement map, but having clearly interpretable density in the non-uniform refinement map. Central \u03b1-helices (right) show less improvement, but map quality remains equal or slightly improved. This result is significant because it shows that reconstructions of proteins without disorder are not harmed by using non-uniform refinement.",

B computation captures the additional high-frequency signal lost due to computational errors in alignment or reconstruction from the image data. Figure 7A (left) shows overall B-factors fit to reconstructions for the four datasets discussed above, with uniform and non-uniform refinement, given the same image data. The Guinier plot in Fig. 7 (right) illustrates the difference in high-frequency signal decay between the two types of refinement, here for the Na v 1.7 channel dataset. For all datasets, non-uniform refinement B-factor magnitudes are smaller than for uniform refinement. Since B image is the same in both methods, it follows that non-uniform refinement has lower B computation , losing less high frequency signal to misalignment. This difference also suggests that using non-uniform refinement should in general require less image data to reach the same resolutions as uniform refinement, consistent with what we observed with the STRA6-CaM dataset above.",

Although the aim of non-uniform refinement is not to estimate resolution per se, the regularizer parameter \u03b8(x) does correspond to a local frequency band-limit at each voxel. As such, it might be viewed as a proxy for local resolution, but with some important differences.

This technique is used extensively for visualization, for assessing map quality in different regions of a particle, and during molecular model building. The family of filters and local filter band-limits are typically selected to maximize subjective visual quality and are therefore not optimized against the estimator used to determine local resolution. Considerations are also not made in this technique to control the number of degrees of freedom or model complexity of the local filter parameters. Furthermore, information from opposite half-set reconstructions is typically shared, breaking independence.

Figure 8 gives an example of the over-fitting that often occurs. During iterative refinement, small mis-estimations of local resolution at a few locations (due to high estimator variance [2] ) cause subtle over-or under-fitting, leaving slight density variations. Over multiple iterations of refinement, these errors can produce strong erroneous density that contaminate particle alignments and the local estimation of resolution itself, creating a vicious cycle. A related technique using iterative local resolution and filtering was described briefly in EMAN2.2 documentation [1] and may suffer the same problem. The resulting artefacts (e.g., streaking and spikey density radiating from the structure) are particularly prevalent in datasets with junk particles, structured outliers, or small particles that are already difficult to align. To mitigate these problems, the approach we advocate couples an implicit resolution measure to a particular choice of local regularizer, with optimization explicitly designed to control model capacity and avoid over-fitting of regularizer parameters. Another related technique, used in cisTEM [11] and its predecessor Frealign [12] , entails the manual creation of a mask to directly label a region of a structure that one expects to be disordered (eg., a detergent micelle), followed by low-pass filtering in that region to a single pre-set resolution at each iteration of refinement. This technique, one of the first to acknowledge and address the issue of simultaneous under-and over-fitting, shares the same intuitions behind non-uniform refinement. Nevertheless, it relies on manual decisions about how to regularize a map during refinement. Refinement is sensitive to regularization, and manual choices necessitate a trial and error process that can be tedious and difficult to replicate across datasets or by others.",

In most single particle EM reconstruction methods, the Fourier basis is chosen primarily because the Fourier Slice Theorem facilitates fast projection evaluation and reconstruction.

Wavelet bases have also been suggested [30] , the basis functions of which are simultaneously localized in space and the Fourier domain. Indeed, wavelets are used in methods for local resolution estimation [2, 17, 29] . Kucukelbir et al [16] describe an interesting approach to iterative refinement with an adaptive wavelet basis and a sparsity prior. This approch is also similar in spirit to the goal in this work, but their model has a single regularization parameter for the entire 3D map. It is based on the noise variance estimated from the corners of particle images, which may not capture local variations in noise due to disorder, motion, or partial occupancy. Nevertheless, like the cross-validation approach here, the authors also find that with a data-driven approach they can largely avoid the need for manual parameter setting and the spatial masking that is needed with a Fourier basis.",

Non-uniform refinement uses cross-validation regularization as a principled tool for parameter estimation in noisy inverse problems like cryo-EM reconstruction. In this way, we are able to incorporate into the algorithm, and exploit, the domain knowledge that many types of proteins contain regions with varying levels of disorder, flexibility, or occupancy. These variations lead uniform refinement algorithms to under-or over-regularize regions of a 3D density map during refinement. Instead, non-uniform refinement automatically identifies and treats local regions optimally, without introducing bias into \"gold standard\" estimation of resolution with the FSC and without any specific knowledge about any particular protein.",

The fact that non-uniform refinement locally regularizes 3D maps during refinement indicates that there may in fact be significant structure resolved beyond the global FSC-based resolution to which final maps are filtered before visualization. We do not address this possibility here, but it does raise the interesting question of how one can then effectively measure resolution in general (similar to the premise of [2] ).",

B: Unsharpened density map at the 8 th iteration of a simpler iterative refinement scheme where local resolution estimation and local filtering are performed at each iteration. Both maps are thresholded at the same level. The map in B has acquired clear artefacts of over-fitting, with incorrect highresolution density dominating the peripheral transmembrane region of the protein. This artefactual density continues to strengthen over subsequent iterations, contaminating local resolution estimates and leading to errors in particle alignments.",
