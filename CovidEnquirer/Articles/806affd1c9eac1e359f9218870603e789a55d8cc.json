The presence of rotavirus was studied by direct electron microscopy (EM) and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). From 136 samples analyzed during the six months of the study (September 1983--February 1984), 38 (27.9%) were found to be positive for rotaviruses, with infection more common in animals that were 4--6 weeks old. Atypical rotaviruses were not detected in any of the samples examined. Most rotavirus positive specimens were subgrouped using specific monoclonal antibodies in an ELISA test. The majority of the samples (26 out of 38) were found to exhibit Subgroup I antigenicity. Only two specimens, collected from the same herd in two consecutive months, were found to belong to Subgroup II. To characterize further the circulating rotaviruses, electrophoretic analysis of the RNA genome was performed on samples selected from nine different herds. Great variability in the RNA electropherotypes was observed. No correlation was found between subgroup specificity and the migration of the two smaller segments (Genes 10 and 11), as has been described for human rotaviruses.",

            "text": "Rotaviruses possess a genome composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, surrounded by two concentric protein shells formed by at least six structural polypeptides . Current research focuses on the identification of antigenic variations among rotavirus isolates (WHO Scientific Committee on Viral Diarrheas, 1984) . The major polypeptide of the inner shell (p45K) carries a group-specific antigen, which is common among rotaviruses isolated from different animal species. However, the same polypeptide also carries one of two subgroup specificities (I or II) which is easily detected by using subgroup-specific monoclonal antibodies (Greenberg et al., 1983) . Neither the group-common nor the subgroup-specific antigenicities are found on some \"atypical\" rotaviruses (\"pararotaviruses\") which have been isolated from different animal species, including pigs (Bohl et al., 1982; Bridger et al., 1982) . Subgroup antigens do not appear to be related to neutralization or immunoprotection, but they provide useful markers for epidemiological studies. The other important antigen of rotaviruses appears to be located on the outer-shell glycoprotein (p38K), is related to the neutralization reaction, and defines the different rotavirus serotypes. Thus far, seven different serotypes have been described, and recent findings have demonstrated that certain human and animal rotaviruses may share subgroup or serotype antigens (Hoshino et al., 1984) . Bohl et al. (1984) reported the existence of at least two different serotypes among porcine isolates, with the O.S.U. strain as the prototype of what they called \"porcine Serotype 1\", and the Gottfried strain as the prototype of \"porcine Serotype 2\". The same antigenic difference was found by Hoshino et al. (1984) , with the Gottfried strain belonging, in their classification, to rotavirus Serotype 4 (together with some human isolates), and the O.S.U. strain to their Serotype 5 (together with equine rotavirus H-l). It should be mentioned that the O.S.U. strain shows a Subgroup I specificity, whereas the Gottfried strain is a Subgroup II virus. However, various combinations of subgroup and serotype specificities can be expected as a result of the segmented nature of the viral genome. It is known that Gene 6 codes for the 45K protein, and that one of the genes in the triplet 7-8-9 codes for 38K glycoprotein (Mason et al., 1983) . In vivo reassortment of such genes may result in the generation of new antigenic variants, a phenomenon that can be studied by analyzing the electrophoretic patterns of genomic RNA (Estes et al., 1984) .",

Each sample was studied by both methods, in attempts to identify antigenically distinct \"atypical\" rotaviruses. These are morphologically similar to \"classical\" rotaviruses, but lack the groupspecific antigen detectable by the ELISA test. Overall, the ELISA test proved to be more sensitive than routine examination of samples by EM. Of the 38 positive samples, only 28 were easily diagnosed by EM, whereas no sample positive by EM was negative by ELISA. Atypical rotaviruses were not detected in the specimens examined. At variance with the early infection observed with pathogenic E. coil (Garcla et al., 1986) , rotavirus infection was found to be more prevalent in animals~ that were 4--6 weeks old (Table I) . ",

The diversity of electropherotypes present in a relatively closed population is evident. With the possible exception of the two Subgroup II rotaviruses, for which comparisons were difficult due to the scarcity of one of the samples, no two electropherotypes were identical. With regard to the mobilities of the two smaller genes (10 and 11), all of the samples, regardless of subgroup specificity, showed similar patterns of migration, in contrast to the \"short\" (Subgroup I) and the \"long\" (Subgroup II) patterns described for human rotaviruses . A better comparison of different electropherotypes can be made by coelectrophoresis of the two samples. Such analysis of six selected samples is shown in Fig. 3 . The first co-electrophoresis, performed with samples obtained during October 1983 from two neighbouring farms (Samples B and C), showed doublet bands corresponding to different mobilities of Genes 4, 7 and 8. When Sample C was compared with a specimen obtained the following month, from a more distant herd (Sample D), differences in mobility were observed in Bands 4, 6, 8 and 10, suggestive of a more distant genetic relationship.

At least three different strains have been studied in pigs: a Belgian isolate (Debouck and Peusaert, 1979) , one from the United Kingdom (Bridger et al., 1982) , and one from the United States (Saif et al., 1980; Bohl et al., 1982) . A comparison of the U.K. and U.S.A. strains of atypical porcine rotaviruses revealed that they were unrelated as shown by cross-immunofluorescence studies (Pedtey et al., 1983) . That observation, also supported by genome profile and terminal fingerprint analysis, led to proposals for the existence of at least three separate rotavirus groups: A, that includes the classical rotaviruses, such as the O.S.U. strain; B, atypical rotaviruses with the group antigen of the British NIRO-1 strain; and C, atypical rotaviruses with the group antigen of the American Cowden strain. Antigenic differences among human atypical rotaviruses have also been reported (Puerto et al., 1984) . Examination of porcine field sera indicate that rotaviruses belonging to all three antigenic groups are prevalent in pigs in the United Kingdom (Bridget et al., 1984) . Moreover, Debouck et al. (1984) , in Belgium, reported the frequent excretion of atypical rotaviruses in piglets over 18 days of age, most cases being subclinical infections. We were unable to detect atypical (Group B and C) rotaviruses in the diarrhoeic samples examined. All faecal samples containing rotavirus particles demonstrated the presence of Group A (O.S.U.) antigens by ELISA. Confirmation was made by genomic RNA electrophoresis, since atypical rotaviruses have very characteristic RNA electropherotypes. Group A rotavirus belonging to the two subgroup antigenic specificities were demonstrated, with most samples being classified as Subgroup I. Recent work in our laboratory (Palencia et al., unpublished observations) indicates that herds located in the same region may have both kinds of viruses circulating and even infecting the same animal.",

One is that rotaviruses do not readily spread from herd to herd, as suggested for human strains of rotaviruses (Nicolas et al., 1984) . The second explanation for the electropherotypic variation is based on a high mutation rate of the RNA polymerase, which could introduce point mutations, resulting in different mobilities of the RNA segments. An additional mechanism for rapid genetic evolution could be mediated by gene segment reassortments, a phenomenon that has been documented in vitro for rotaviruses . In favour of the point mutation hypothesis are the data recently presented by Konno et al. (1984) , showing that at the beginning of a human rotavirus epidemic a single electropherotype is found, whereas later a great number of different electropherotypes are present. The authors suggested that a single strain of rotavirus is first introduced into a community, causing an outbreak of infection, and then changes under selective pressure so that genetically different strains emerge. The endemic nature of rotavirus infections in the tropics hampers the detection of \"original\" electropherotypes.",
