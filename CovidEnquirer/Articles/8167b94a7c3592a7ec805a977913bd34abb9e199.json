            "text": "The ability to provide medical care during sudden increases in patient volume during a disaster or other highconsequence event is a substantial concern for health-care systems. History has shown that during disasters and epidemiological outbreaks, hospitals take the burden of caring for the sick and injured. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] In most major city hospitals, inpatient capacity is constrained on a daily basis. [7] [8] [9] Thus, hospitals are concerned about maintenance of inpatient capacity during normal operating conditions, and they are developing methods to improve resource capabilities during surges. 10, 11 Several measures have been suggested for the creation of hospital surge capacity. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] These include: cancellation of elective admissions and operations; redesign of current inpatient space to accommodate more beds when needed; opening of unlicensed or unstaff ed beds; rapidly outfi tting temporary nearby space, such as cafeterias or outpatient facilities; or deployment of temporary portable inpatient units. All these possibilities present unique operational challenges, such as imposition of unpractised routines in the context of rapid incremental demand for inpatient census. Furthermore, most options need hospital staffi ng to be increased at a time when the case-mix index can also be expected to increase. However, during some publichealth emergencies, especially those of a com municable nature, hospitals are likely to have substantial reductions in available staff , as happened during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. [17] [18] [19] Thus, for acute-care hospitals, a means to achieve maximum availability of capacity resources to allow for the care of victims of a disaster is a priority. 20 One novel approach to capacity management during disasters is reverse triage, which includes the safe discharge of current inpatients and refocus of hospital resources to those in even greater need. Patients might be discharged home, to facilities set up to care for less acute inpatients (eg, public-health contingency stations 21 specifi cally designed for this purpose), nursing homes, or other acute-care facilities. Thus, a need exists to develop an easy method to categorise hospital patients for safe discharge to suitable venues (including early discharge home), taking into account the existence and competence (or lack thereof) of available external resources.",

We focus on the main components of the fi rst phase: (1) conceptualisation of the disposition classifi cation system; (2) development of operational defi nitions of consequential medical events and critical interventions; and (3) derivation of risk estimates related to early discharge from a multidisciplinary panel of experts. Subsequent phases of this project will use clinical data obtained from nearly 4000 hospital patients to examine the validity of the classifi cation system to correctly identify those who can be discharged early.",

Evidencebased information was presented about decision-making devices (eg, Patient Outcomes Research Team [PORT] and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [Apache] III), peer-reviewed publications, and data for adverse events, readmission rate of discharged patients, and iatrogenic events related to being in hospital.",

Panellists also agreed that this category of patients could warrant discharge in certain biothreat or other contagion situations in which spread of disease in hospitals would present a substantial added risk. An example would be a patient with acute coronary syndrome with no evidence of high risk for adverse events. Category 3 represented patients who were potentially suitable for transfer to another medical facility. As a group, the risk was judged too high for simple discharge home. An example would be a stable elderly patient who is progressing well 3 days after hip-fracture surgery. Category 4 patients were those at substantial risk and judged likely to need continued acute-hospital resources. Examples of such patients include those in need of emergency surgery, those in need of pressors, and those in active labour. Finally, category 5 patients were those who might be too unstable or critically ill even for transfer to another appropriate facility. Most of these patients would require specialised medical care. Most patients in intensive-care units would be in this category. Table 2 shows the consensus list of critical interventions that if withdrawn would result in a consequential medical event. Less than half the critical interventions were assessed as 7 or higher (on a scale of 1-10). Only two-thirds were ranked higher than 5.

Most of these techniques need increased staffi ng at a time when either staff are not available, staffi ng is degraded because of the disaster itself, or staff are co-opted by the public-health system for other needs.

Once the categories are established, the next step will be to derive a system that allows classifi cation of individual hospital patients in real time. To accomplish this, measurable outcomes and prognostic variables are required. The panel initially defi ned critical interventions as a means to understand the notions of risk. However, the consensus critical interventions will also serve as the outcome measures in subsequent studies. What constitutes a consequential medical event is subjective. Thus, the critical interventions that are the outcome proxy measures were weighted for likely importance. Future analysis will consider the accuracy of such weighting.",

In view of the increasing trend toward electronic medical data, prognostic variables of potential interest-eg, vital signs, key laboratory values, diagnostic considerations, co-morbid conditions-could be captured and continuously updated in real-time. Thus, in the event of a disaster, patients would be predesignated for the lowest risk disposition options, through the use of a system such as the one proposed here. If such a system were in place, each patient would have a continuously, updated reliable risk score to assist in disposition making. Starting with those with the lowest risk, discharges would take place in an ascending order of risk. Furthermore, in the future when prognostic scoring of risk for pre-hospital or emergency-department based disaster triage are developed and reliable, the entire demand for inpatient resources from all sources can be simultaneously ascertained and decisions made accordingly. The value of such a device is not only to augment surge capacity, but also to help with rapid decisions when complete or part hospital evacuations are required, such as happened during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Toronto. A further and potentially important value of the development of a risk-based disposition classifi cation system is that it is also designed for everyday hospital use. Emergency Departments in many parts of the world are often overcrowded, mainly as a result of severely restricted in-patient capacity. Thus, on a small, but real scale, disaster-like settings arise every day. The device being developed here could have a substantial eff ect on the safe management of hospital capacity on a routine daily basis.",

Simulating a disaster, we randomly sampled non-intensive-care unit adult patients from 50 medical units in our three-hospital system during 19 weeks. 37 Of the 4781 patients sampled, 786 (16%) were discharged routinely on the day of the disaster. Of the remaining patients, 2797 (70%) either had no critical interventions or were discharged in any event during the next 72 h. Although full analysis remains to be completed, these data are consistent with those reported by Davis and colleagues. 38 Physicians and nurses in this study opined that about 50% of patients were dischargeable during 72 h. When controlling for patients in intensivecare, the proportion of capacity is similar to ours. Finally, a study from a tertiary-care teaching hospital in the UK, also using opinion survey of nurses showed that more than a third of inpatient beds (including those in intensive-care units) could be made available within 4-12 h of a disaster if increased care were available in the community. 39 The fundamental problem with estimation of capacity on the basis of opinion surveys is absence of evidence that the estimates would result in safe practice. Furthermore, as in the case of the UK study, which called for aug mentation of community resources, it is unclear whether these resources could reasonably be increased during catastrophic events. Our approach is to establish the scientifi c basis for a practice that can be modifi able for use both daily and during catastrophic events.",

Although many of the panellists have varied geographic and institutional experience, we did not attempt to ensure that every hospital structure and size was represented by all disciplines. Thus, inherent geographic or regional bias in the established ranges of risk tolerance could have occurred. However, as noted, about 25% of the panel were not from our system, and most of the panellists had other national and international experience. Even so, the model described is suffi ciently robust that risk tolerance notions can be scaled to an individual hospital and even an individual service. If adopted for daily routine use, risk tolerances for categories 1 and 2 might change or be subject to local customs. We did not consider patient or lay perspectives, but again, the variables of the proposed device can be modifi ed in those settings that wish to consider such views. Also, simulations used here might not represent reality, but most disaster planning is based on simulated exercises due to an absence of empirical data. Furthermore, other systems have been developed on the basis of clinical judgment, in the absence of empirical data. One example is the Abbreviated Injury Scale, 40, 41 which was originally based on clinical-judgment ratings, and has subsequently been shown to be both valid and reliable in measuring injury severity. More recently, Hick and O'Laughlin, 42 using a less structured consensus format, developed an ethical framework for the distribution of scarce intensive-care-unit resources during disasters.",
