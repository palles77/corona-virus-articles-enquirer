Emphasis has been placed on tests with high market share in diagnostic microbiology and on those with technologies that are personally regarded by the authors as particularly interesting. The role of specimen processing in concentrating nucleic acid targets and removing inhibitors of amplification is largely neglected, despite its important role in the sensitivity of the assay. However, many new procedures are automated and include specimen processing as part of a hands-off procedure. Most techniques mentioned here involve real-time PCR (RT-PCR), unless otherwise specified. Because most RT-PCR platforms are closed systems, they decrease the incidence of amplicon contamination in the laboratory, and have allowed many nucleic acid amplification techniques to become commercially available. The authors have also attempted to select current citations to support salient points, and these selections are arbitrary.

The hybridization protection assays are based on the differential sensitivity of the acridinium ester, which is used to distinguish the relatively labile ester on nonhybridized probes from the more stable form in DNA-RNA hybrids. This detection system is also used in this manufacturer's nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). All the AccuProbe assays are similar, but the nucleic acid release steps are variable, depending on the ease of disruption of the organism. 6 The mycobacterial probe tests are particularly valuable when used in conjunction with liquid medium or 7H11 thin-plate techniques 7 used for the rapid detection and identification of mycobacteria required by the College of American Pathologists (Northfield, IL). Thin-plate colonies can be probed the day they are detected, and their morphology can be used as a guide to selection of the appropriate probe. This represents significant time and money savings, although it does not eliminate the need to grow M tuberculosis for susceptibility testing. Cultures in Middlebrook 7H9 broth must be AFB stained to confirm the presence of mycobacteria 8 and then probed with all 4 probes. The probe techniques described are also used to detect amplification products in amplification assays developed by GenProbe/Hologic for sexually transmitted diseases and blood bank testing (discussed elsewhere in this article).",

In the 1980s and 1990s, it was recognized that infection with HPV is necessary but not sufficient for the development of cervical carcinoma. More than 100 HPV genotypes exist, of which 13 are associated with a high risk of cervical carcinoma (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) . More than 70% of sexually active women become infected with HPV. Most infections, even with high-risk organisms, resolve without apparent sequalae. Why others progress is still unknown. 9 The Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (hc2; Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) is FDA approved for primary screening, and to determine whether women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance should be subjected to culposcopy. It may be used with the Cytyc PreservCyt Solution for the Cytyc ThinPrep Pap Test (Hologic). 10 In the first step, the patient specimen is allowed to react with a pool of RNA probes designed to hybridize specifically to the DNA of high-risk HPV strains. Antibody to RNA/DNA hybrids coats the wells of a microtiter plate and captures any hybrids. After washing away unbound specimen and reagents, detector antihybrid antibodies, each conjugated with multiple molecules of alkaline phosphatase, bind to each capture target, thereby amplifying the signal. A colorless substrate for the alkaline phosphatase is added and chemiluminescence develops proportional to the amount of second antibody bound.",

The need for more sensitivity has been questioned, because hc2 has already been shown to be sensitive, but not highly specific, for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or overt malignancy. The presence of high-risk DNA below the detection limit of hc2 seems to be associated with a low risk for malignancy. 9 However, new information suggests that infections acquired in the early years of sexual activity may reactivate with aging. 11 If this is supported by further studies, more sensitive assays might be indicated. There is also a suggestion that unusual HPV strains may cause cervical carcinoma or precursor lesions in restricted populations. 12 Thus, the strains included in the assay may need periodic review. Amplification techniques are now available which can distinguish HPV-16 and HPV-18 from the other high-risk organisms, which has facilitated targeted follow-up algorithms, and outcomes data are increasing so that this unique probe technique is becoming less common. The use of hybrid capture as the basis a detection system in amplification assays is still possible, and used in some assays; however, it is not considered a method with high sensitivity.",

Common agents of sepsis can be identified in about an hour after the blood culture bottle has been gram stained.

This is thought to allow the probes to enter the permeabilized bacterial cell more easily and then bind more tightly to the negatively charged rRNA target. Numerous publications confirm that the use of this technique for rapid identification of the common organisms growing in the blood culture bottles improves antibiotic stewardship and shortens length of stay. 1,2 Depending on the patient, identification of a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus may facilitate discontinuation of antibiotics and early discharge.",

            "text": "Affirm VPIII microbial identification test The VPIII probe test (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) is intended for the diagnosis of vaginitis/vaginosis, conditions causing millions of physician visits annually. Affirm detects rRNA from Gardnerella vaginalis, used as an indicator for bacterial vaginosis (BV), C albicans, and Trichomonas vaginalis. The sensitivity has been adjusted to avoid giving positive results with low concentrations of G vaginalis and C albicans, which often colonize the normal vagina using a lateral flow immunochromatographic enzyme assay. This assay maintains low sensitivity (requiring about 5000 copies of trichomonas nucleic acid to give a positive result), which may be ideal for Gardnerella but bad for Trichomonas species. It is formatted to be performed in a cassette superficially resembling the lateral flow tests used for the serologic detection of influenza or rotavirus antigens and was the first FDA-approved molecular test based on lateral flow. The methodology for lateral flow is as follows: after collection on a proprietary swab, the specimen is lysed to release the nucleic acids, buffered to stabilize the nucleic acids and establish stringency, and added to the cassette, which is incubated at the proper temperature for nucleic acid hybridization. The cassette contains 5 \"beads,\" each coupled to a capture probe: 1 for each of the 3 analytes, plus positive and negative controls. Next, enzymelinked detector probes bind to specific sequences on the target organism's rRNA. Unbound sample components and probes are washed away. A colorless substrate is converted to a blue product if sufficient target and detector probe have bound. A blue \"bead\" indicates a positive result. 17 Numerous publications have revealed that health care providers are significantly less accurate than VPIII for the diagnosis of significant candidiasis and T vaginalis. The Affirm test has highlighted the fact that multiple infections are common. The role of the VPIII in the diagnosis of BV is the subject of debate, however, because the use of G vaginalis alone as an indicator of BV is not optimal. In addition, there have been criticisms of the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay, particularly for T vaginalis, and of the inability of the assay to highlight the presence of drug-resistant Candida spp. Automated NAAT assays (including the MAX Vaginal Panel assay by Becton Dickinson) resolve many of these problems. Becton Dickinson now suggests that the Affirm assay may be appropriate for smaller laboratories, whereas larger laboratories may wish to transition to its NAAT assay.",

The first PCR assay, the semiautomated Amplicor C trachomatis/N gonorrhoeae test, was developed by Roche (Basel, Switzerland). It was closely followed by the Abbott LCX assay (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) for the Diagnostic Molecular Microbiology simultaneous detection of C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae, which used ligase chain reaction technology to amplify the targets. In 2003, the Abbott LCX assay for C trachomatis/ Gonococci was withdrawn abruptly from the market. In the late 1990s, other amplification assays became available, a strand-displacement amplification assay from Becton Dickinson, the ProbeTec ET, and a transcription-mediated amplification test from GenProbe were introduced. Both of these evolved over the years and additional tests were also FDA approved. Other testing approaches include the Becton Dickinson ProbeTec C trachomatis/Gonococci Qx assay performed on the Viper XTR, Hologic/Gen-Probe Aptima Combo 2 assay performed on both the Panther and Tigris instruments, the Abbott Real-Time C trachomatis/N gonorrhoeae assay, and the Roche Diagnostics Cobas C trachomatis/N gonorrhoeae assay run on the Cobas 4800 instrument.",

            "text": "This assay is performed on either the Tigris or the Panther instruments. It targets a region of the 23S rRNA of C trachomatis and one from the 16S rRNA from Gonococci. They are amplified via DNA intermediates by using transcription-mediated amplification, a technique that uses both a reverse transcriptase enzyme and a phage-derived RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The detection of the amplicons is achieved using the hybridization protection assay described herein in the section on probe tests. Briefly, single-strand chemiluminescent DNA probes bind to their complementary target, protecting the labile acridinium ester. After hydrolysis of the esters on unbound probes, light emitted from the ester that had been protected within the target-probe hybrids is measured and reported as relative light units. Assay results are determined by a cutoff based on the total relative light units and the curve type. 19, 20 Becton Dickinson ProbeTec C trachomatis/Gonococci Qx assay on the Viper XTR This assay uses the isothermal DNA nick translation technique called stranddisplacement amplification for the detection of target sequences in the patient sample. It targets a sequence in the cryptic C trachomatis plasmid and a sequence of Gonococci genomic DNA, respectively. Extraction of DNA from clinical samples is based on pH-dependent binding of the DNA to ferric oxide particles followed by binding of the combination to paramagnetic beads. After removing the contaminants, the purified DNA is released and amplified by real-time strand-displacement amplification in the presence of a fluorescently labeled detector probe. The presence of the target DNA is determined by comparing the peak fluorescence with a cutoff value. Many articles have discussed the performance of this assay to detect the targets in clinical specimens, such as urine or vaginal/cervical samples. This assay is not evaluated for pregnant women as well as patients younger than 18 years of age. [21] [22] [23] The Abbott RealTime C trachomatis/N gonorrhoeae assay This RT-PCR assay targets 2 sequences within the cryptic plasmid of C trachomatis. This plasmid is found in all serovars of Chlamydia to date. The dual targets allow detection of both the wild-type C trachomatis and the variant, which has a deletion in one of the target sequences. The Gonococci target is found within the organism's Opa gene. Cheng and colleagues 24 evaluated the Abbott RealTime C trachomatis/Gonococci assay in comparison with the Roche Cobas Amplicor C trachomatis/N gonorrhoeae assay. They showed high agreement between the 2 assay. However, their data demonstrated that the Abbott assay was more sensitive than the Roche assay for both C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae with enhanced ability to detect dual infections.",

When activated by incident ultraviolet light, the first fluorophore emits energy at an unmonitored wavelength. If the second probe is bound adjacent to it, the energy is transferred to the second fluorophore, which then emits light at the wavelength monitored by the sensor. At the end of the PCR assay, a melting curve for the amplicon-probe complex can be generated. The melting temperature is characteristic of each amplicon-probe combination. If there is a mismatch between the probe and the amplicon, the melting temperature decreases. 28 The melting temperature difference has been exploited in a test that distinguishes between herpes simplex 1 and 2 (Roche). The PCR primers bind sequences common to both viruses within the HSV DNA polymerase gene. The amplicon detector probes match the HSV-2 sequence, which differs from that of HSV-1 by 2 bp. Melting curve analysis reveals a reproducible melting temperature for HSV-2 that is about 10 C higher than that exhibited by HSV-1. 29 Occasional mutant HSV strains have been detected that have intermediate melting temperatures. These tests can be reported as positive for HSV, but the type is not clear. Types 1 and 2 could be distinguished by sequencing the amplicons, by using an assay using a different target sequence, or by the melting temperature of the amplicon, which is said to be 0.9 C higher for the HSV-2 variant than the type 1 variant. 30 The MultiCode RTx system uses an unusual PCR amplification technique in which no detector probe is used and in which the fluorescence actually decreases as amplification progresses. It was developed by EraGen BioSciences, Inc (Madison, WI; acquired by Luminex Corporation [Austin, TX] in 2011). Their MultiCode-RTx herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 kit was FDA approved in 2011. MultiCode RTx assays use 2 unusual nucleotide bases iC (2-deoxy-5-methylisocytidine) and iG (2-deoxyisoguanoside) that base pair only to one another and that are efficiently incorporated into PCR products. iG is put at the 5 0 end of the RTx primers along with its linked fluorophore. The reaction mix contains iC covalently linked to a quencher. In the initial cycle amplification, the iG, with its attached fluorophore, appears at the 5 0 end of the primer and hence at the 5 0 end of the nascent amplicon strands. When these serve as templates for copying in the other direction, an iC, with its attached quencher is added to the 3 0 end of the new strand, opposite the iG and its fluorophore. The approximation of fluorophore and quencher decreases the fluorescence. In melting curve analysis, fluorescence increases as the amplicons melt, and the melting temperature allows determination of the nature of the analyte. 31",

Even at the peak of an influenza epidemic, an individual may be infected with respiratory syncytial virus instead or concurrently. Furthermore, mixed infections are more common than many had imagined. 35, 36 Some virus infections are treatable, and others have different isolation requirements if the patient is hospitalized. 36 Thus, molecular panels that could detect multiple etiologic agents of diseases clearly are desirable.

The FARP provides a result within about 1 hour, requiring only a few minutes of hands-on time, but can handle only 1 sample at a time. It seems ideally suited to a medium-sized laboratory where technologists without specialized molecular expertise can perform the tests. Some larger laboratories have bought multiple instruments or instruments with higher throughput (eg, Torch from BioFire) to facilitate throughput. But surge capacity may be lacking. The other systems test samples in batch mode with high throughput, but they require sample extraction before testing, and amplicon manipulation afterward, which may confine them to a \"PCR laboratory.\" Each handles 21 samples per run. None is suitable for 2 runs per shift, although staggered technologist start times could allow it with the xRVPF.

At that time, mass spectroscopy was used almost exclusively for the identification of anaerobes by analysis of volatile or volatilized short-chain organic acids. New mass spectroscopy techniques provide a general tool for the identification of microorganisms growing in colonies on culture plates. This requires 2 to 5 minutes and has the potential to improve significantly the turnaround time for microbiology culture reports and to reduce labor costs, especially when coupled with other laboratory automation that is now becoming available. Up-front costs are high, but the cost per test is low and the rapidity of results and low cost per individual result can impact antibiotic usage and patient outcomes, shortening hospital stays and lowering total costs. 3 The new technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Currently, there are 2 FDA-approved MALDI-TOF instruments available in the United States for rapid identification of microorganisms: one developed by Shimadzu Scientific Instruments (Columbia, MD) and licensed to BioMerieux (Durham, NC) and a second, manufactured by Bruker Daltonics (Billerica, MA), and licensed to both Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics (Tarrytown, NY) and to Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD).

            "text": "Interest has also recently been generated in the possibility of using Raman spectroscopy for the rapid identification of a variety of bacteria. Raman spectroscopy uses the interaction of light with molecules to measure functional group vibrations. When photons from an incident, focused laser interact with a molecule, they cause the molecule to transition to an excited vibrational state, accompanied by a corresponding energy loss in the photon; this energy loss results in the light undergoing a frequency shift, and hence a change in color, which is measured. The spectrum is unique for each bacterial species. It can be checked against a database for rapid identification of the pathogen. Raman spectroscopy is distinct from other current techniques because of its ease, low cost, and high speed. It provides information on the chemical composition and the structure of biomolecules within the microorganisms. Thus, slight changes in the chemical makeup of organisms can be determined by Raman spectroscopy and used to differentiate genera, species, or even strains. A study by Chouthai and colleagues, 53 showed reliable, rapid, and accurate identification of Candida species using Raman spectroscopy. Detection of pathogens is possible from complex matrices, such as soil, food, and body fluids. Further, spectroscopic analysis may allow determination of the effect of antibiotics on bacteria.

The AXDX generated an antibiotic susceptibility testing result for 91.3% (95 of 104) samples in which it identified a gramnegative pathogen. They found the overall category agreement of 96.4%, for sensitive, intermediate, and resistant interpretation between AXDX and culture-based antibiotic susceptibility testing, with the rate for minor discrepancies 1.4% (change between sensitive or resistant and intermediate), major discrepancies 2.3% and 33 very major discrepancies 1.0%. 57",

            "text": "LifeScale biosensor rapid antimicrobial susceptibility LifeScale (Affinity Biosensors, Santa Barbara, CA) uses resonant mass measurement to enumerate and determine the mass of bacteria exposed to antibiotics, allowing it to determine antibiotic susceptibility within approximately 3 hours. A beam suspended at 1 end resonates at a specific frequency. If a mass is added to the beam, the resonant frequency decreases an amount related to the added mass. The beam is suspended in a vacuum and the bacteria, in growth medium, pass through a microchannel in the beam. This technology has been developed into the Life Scale Biosensor, which can make these determinations in a standard 96-well plate, including the minimum inhibitory concentration plates prepared by Sensititre (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA). Individual bacteria can be enumerated and their individual masses rapidly determined (in femtograms 10 \u00c015 g) can be determined rapidly as they pass through the microchannel in the beam. Two posters were presented at the 2016 ASM Microbe to demonstrate proof of concept. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using multiple gram-negative organisms that are generally used in clinical laboratories as antibiotic susceptibility testing control organisms. Resonant mass measurement and standard laboratory antibiotic susceptibility testing results were compared. More than two-thirds of these antibiotics demonstrated 100% essential agreement with the standard results after 3 hours or less, whereas the standard techniques required 16 to 24 hours. Two antibiotics were in less than 90% categorical agreement and required a longer incubation time. The results indicate that a rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing based on resonant mass measurement produces reliable antibiotic susceptibility testing results on gram-negative strains. Ongoing investigations are planned to extend these results to gram-positive strains and to validate the method on clinical samples from positive blood cultures. 58, 59 Colorimetric sensor array: use of volatile organic compounds and color active indicator array for rapid bacterial identification The SpecID (Specific Technologies, Mt. Lakes, CA) blood culture system provides organism detection and identification while the etiologic agent of sepsis is growing in a modified blood culture bottle and does so more rapidly than detection alone can occur in similar comparator blood culture bottles. When bacteria grow, they produce characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOC) that accumulate in the head gasses above the culture medium in the bottle; the spectrum of VOC produced is characteristic of a given genus and species of bacteria. An inexpensive, disposable array can be substituted for the top of a bottle or built into a proprietary bottle. This array consists of chemical indicators that change color differently when exposed to the VOC mixtures, allowing for the determination of the VOCs released. The first instrument using this technique was shown in Amsterdam at European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 2016. In a proof-of-principle paper, Lim and colleagues 60 demonstrated that the SpecID fingerprint can detect and identification the VOC fingerprints of organisms in pure culture with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 99.4%, respectively. It could distinguish between strains of S aureus, suggesting that it may be used for epidemiologic purposes as well. Furthermore, detection was rapid, with organism identification with the arrays detecting growth almost 2 hours faster than the standard system. Whether it will work in mixed infections remains to be determined.",

Bottles containing no yeast were reported as negative, and the yeast in all positive bottles were detected correctly, regardless of a wide range of inoculum sizes. Growth by colorimetric sensor array was detected 6.8 hours faster than BacT/Alert system.

Currently available NGS techniques are based on using clonal amplicons for parallel multistrand sequencing. The combination of high-speed and high-throughput data analysis has made NGS an excellent tool to take clinical analysis of nucleic acid sequences to a new level. With NGS, it is possible to detect and quantify quasispecies of HIV, HCV, or hepatitis B virus circulating at low levels in the blood of infected patients and to learn more about their roles in the development of resistance and associated treatment failures. This was difficult or impossible by using methods mentioned previously. Despite increasing numbers of articles on the applications of NGS, this system has not found its way into routine clinical microbiology testing because of lack of FDA approval, high cost, and availability of alternative technologies. 28 From the diagnostic microbiology viewpoint, NGS has significantly improved our ability to study the makeup of entire communities of microorganisms without culture. NGS can provide the genetic sequences of the members of entire microbial communities (microbiomes) and determine their relative frequencies. It could also be used to determine gene expression and metabolic pathway use in a microbial community, although this is currently beyond the scope of the clinical microbiology laboratory. Many studies of human microbiomes are focusing on the relationship between microbial communities and health and disease, including for example, the effect of colonic microorganisms on cardiovascular disease. 4 NGS has also been applied to rapid investigations of outbreaks in hospital settings. We discuss herein 2 NGS-based diagnostic microbiology systems that are currently fairly advanced in development. They highlight the potential of NGS to improve detection and identification of pathogens in the clinical laboratory, especially those involving organisms that may be difficult or impossible to identify, or those situations that are otherwise technically demanding. [70] [71] [72] Systems Based on Next-Generation Sequencing for the Identification of Pathogens from Clinical Specimens Karius digital culture Karius (Redwood City, CA) has developed an NGS-based test to detect the presence in plasma of cell-free DNA, which is presumably derived from infecting pathogens. After amplification, human DNA is removed by a proprietary technique. NGS is performed on the total nucleic acids, enriching for the microbial sequences. These sequences are aligned with a pathogen sequence bank that consists not only of publicly available genetic information, but also of Karius's internal data. Thus, it can potentially detect thousands of infecting organisms. The system is unique in that it can detect sequences from DNA viruses in addition to those from bacteria and fungi. Like standard organism detection assays, this system can detect bacteremia and fungemia.",

It is the first CE-marked (October 2016), NGS-based method to detect bacteria and viruses in patients with known or suspected infections directly from patient blood thereby improving pathogen detection in biological samples. PathoQuest's technology combines an NGS platform and a proprietary sample preparation process with a proprietary pathogen genome sequence database and automated analysis software covering all known clinically relevant human pathogens. Parize and colleagues, 76 using a prototype version of iDTECT, identified a relevant pathogen in more patients in a difficult-to-diagnose population than conventional testing.",
