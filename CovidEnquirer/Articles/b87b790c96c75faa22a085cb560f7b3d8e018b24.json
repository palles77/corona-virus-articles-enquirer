The organisms within these groups are divided depending on the presence or absence of a nucleus within the cell(s) of the organism. Prokaryotes are organisms without a nucleus to wall off their genetic material from the rest of the cell, while eukaryotes are organisms that contain a nucleus within their cells. All organisms within Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotes, whereas Eukarya-as the name suggestscontains eukaryotes. Viruses exist that infect cells of all three domains. Most of the viruses that are discussed in this book infect humans and other animals, which are eukaryotes. The defining characteristic of a eukaryotic cell is the nucleus, which is generally located in the center of a cell. Many structures, called organelles, are distributed in the liquid cytosol between the nucleus and the plasma membrane of the cell (Fig. 3.1 ). In the same way that each organ of our body performs a specialized function, the organelles within a cell each play a specific role in maintaining an operational cell.",

Phospholipids are a class of lipids; fats, oils, and waxes are other lipids. They are so named because the molecule has two parts: a polar head that contains a phosphate group, and a nonpolar portion that is composed of two fatty acid lipid tails (Fig. 3.2A) . As described in the Chapter 2, \"Virus Structure and Classification,\" Refresher on Chemical Bonds, water is a polar molecule and readily associates with other polar molecules. The phospholipid head of the phospholipid, being polar, is hydrophilic, while the nonpolar tails do not associate with water and are hydrophobic. Because of this amphipathic nature of a phospholipid, a group of phospholipids placed in an aqueous solution (such as the environment of a cell) will spontaneously assemble into a double layer of phospholipid molecules with the hydrophilic polar heads of the molecules facing the aqueous solution and the hydrophobic nonpolar tails associating with each other (Fig. 3.2B ). This forms an effective barrier to prevent large molecules from escaping or A eukaryotic cell contains a centrally located nucleus and several important organelles within the cytosol of the cell that viruses take advantage of during infection. Ribosomes in the cytosol manufacture proteins, and the ribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) make proteins that are folded and modified within the rER. These proteins are then packaged in vesicles and travel to the Golgi complex, where they are finished and shipped to other locations within the cell or outside the cell, through the process of exocytosis. Proteins and other molecules enter the cell via endocytosis. The endocytic vesicles become endosomes, which may fuse with lysosomes that contain enzymes to degrade biological molecules. Viruses will also use the ATP generated by the mitochondria within a cell. Note that not all cellular organelles are described here.",

As mentioned above, the plasma membrane is made of a phospholipid bilayer. The current view of how the membrane is assembled is known as the fluid mosaic model, proposed by Singer and Nicolson. The \"mosaic\" part of the model refers to the presence of proteins suspended in the membrane bilayer. Many proteins, including glycoproteins, are embedded into the lipid bilayer ( Fig. 3 .5). Known as integral proteins, these proteins have a variety of functions, including being receptors for extracellular substances or facilitating the adhesion of one cell to another. Peripheral membrane proteins associate closely with the surface of the membrane but are not integrated within it. The \"fluid\" part of this model refers to the proteins and phospholipid molecules that are noncovalently associated with each other and are therefore not static within the membrane but move around freely.

Cholesterol is also enriched in lipid rafts, portions of the membrane that contain integral proteins involved in transmitting signals to the interior of the cell.",

In bulk-phase endocytosis, the cell forms a vesicle that engulfs whatever molecules are present in the extracellular fluid, and so the process is nonspecific. On the other hand, receptor-mediated endocytosis is initiated when specific ligands bind to receptors that are present on the cell surface. The cell has receptors on its surface for many biological factors, including growth factors and hormones. The cell imports the ligands by forming a vesicle that includes the membrane area with the receptors (Fig. 3 .7A). These endocytic vesicles form in a specific area of the membrane called clathrin-coated pits. Clathrin is a protein that forms a honeycombshaped lattice on the intracellular membrane of the endocytic vesicle ( Fig. 3.7B) .

Ribosomes recognize and bind to the 5\u2032-cap of mRNAs, but some viral mRNAs contain internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that allow ribosomes to bind within the mRNA sequence, without a 5\u2032-cap (Fig. 3.22A and B) . IRES are used to initiate translation in internal sections of viral mRNA that are in a different reading frame, or when the virus has interfered with the normal translation process to inhibit host protein synthesis. Ribosomal frameshifting occurs when a ribosome pauses or meets a \"slippery sequence\" within a piece of mRNA. Instead of continuing to read the codons in frame, the ribosome encounters a problem and moves backward or forward one nucleotide. The result is that the ribosome begins translating a different reading frame than it was previously, producing a different mRNA and protein. Viruses like HIV utilize ribosomal frameshifting to encode several proteins within just one portion of DNA. A similar mechanism occurs with termination suppression, in which a stop codon is suppressed and the ribosome continues translating the mRNA, creating a polyprotein. Ribosomal skipping occurs while the ribosome is translating a viral mRNA. Viral proteins prevent the ribosome from joining a new amino acid to the growing protein chain, which releases the protein from the ribosome. Having not encountered a stop codon, however, the ribosome continues translating the remainder of the viral mRNA. The effect is that several viral proteins can be synthesized with only one piece of mRNA. Leaky scanning happens when a host ribosome encounters a start codon (AUG) within a piece of viral mRNA, but the Kozak consensus sequence (the nucleotides surrounding the start codon) is not in a favourable configuration. The ribosome may begin translation at this site, but the next ribosome that binds to the viral mRNA may continue past this weak start codon to begin translation at the next AUG encountered (Fig.  3.22C ). The result is that one viral mRNA can encode two viral proteins. All of these transcription and translation processes promote the synthesis of viral proteins, often faster and with less energy than normal cellular mechanisms.",

So what is the difference between a polypeptide and a protein? A protein is a complete, functional entity. Some proteins are made of only one polypeptide chain, but other proteins are made of more than one polypeptide chain. Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen in our red blood cells, is a protein composed of four polypeptide chains in total. While discussing protein translation in this chapter, we assume that the polypeptide created by the ribosome will be a functional protein, but keep in mind that many proteins are composed of more than one polypeptide chain.",

Viruses must conform to the limitations of the host cell in order to replicate, but they have evolved many strategies to ensure the preferential transcription of their mRNA transcripts and efficient translation of viral proteins. In leaky scanning, the ribosome begins scanning at the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA and encounters a start codon (AUG) within a piece of viral mRNA, but the Kozak consensus sequence is not in a favorable configuration. The ribosome may begin translation at this site, but the next ribosome that binds to the viral mRNA may continue past this weak start codon to begin translation at the next AUG encountered. The result is that one viral mRNA can encode two viral proteins. Many organelles ensure the efficient functioning of the cell. Ribosomes make proteins and can be free within the cytosol or attached to the rER, which folds and modifies proteins into glycoproteins or lipoproteins after they have been made by the ribosome. These are shipped in vesicles to the Golgi complex, which packages them in vesicles to be delivered to the various parts of the cell or the extracellular space.",

This model states that the phospholipids of the membrane move freely within the membrane, as do the many integral proteins embedded in the membrane. l The process of secreting large molecules, like proteins, from the cell is known as exocytosis. Endocytosis imports large molecules into the cell. Bulk-phase endocytosis forms a vesicle that encapsulates the extracellular fluid, while receptor-mediated endocytosis is initiated when ligands bind to receptors on the cell surface. The ligands are imported in vesicles that form in clathrin-coated pits. l Endocytic vesicles soon fuse with endosomes that increase their acidity as they travel into the cell. l In order to infect a cell, viruses must get through the plasma membrane. Some viruses that enter the cell through endocytosis must also escape from endosomes. The cell cycle is the sequential stages through which a cell grows, replicates its DNA, and divides in two through the process of mitosis. l The four phases of the cell cycle are Gap 1, Synthesis, Gap 2, and Mitosis. l Some viruses require cells to be undergoing cell division because they require enzymes present during mitosis. Many viruses interfere with the stages of the cell cycle to increase the efficiency of viral replication. The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology states that DNA is replicated to create more DNA, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, and mRNA is translated by ribosomes to create proteins. l DNA is composed of four different nucleotides (with bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) bonded together. It is double stranded; each strand has directionality and the \"forward\" direction is termed 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032. Because DNA is antiparallel, the 5\u2032 end of one strand is matched with the 3\u2032 end of the other strand. l DNA replication is semiconservative, so each old strand acts as a template for the new DNA strand. DNA polymerase is the enzyme that reads the old strand in the 3\u2032 \u2192 5\u2032 direction and creates the new strand out of nucleotides in the 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 direction. Nucleotides are added according to complementary base pair rules. l DNA polymerases have high fidelity and make one error in every 1 million nucleotides added, on average. l A few viral families take advantage of cellular DNA polymerases to replicate their DNA genomes.Section 3.5 The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: RNA Transcription and Processing l The process of creating an mRNA copy of a portion of DNA is known as transcription. RNA polymerase II binds to transcription factors that assemble on the promoter of the gene, and the enzyme joins RNA nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil) in the 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 direction to create the precursor mRNA transcript. l RNA polymerases have lower fidelity than DNA polymerases. l Precursor mRNA is processed before leaving the nucleus. The transcript receives a 5\u2032 7-methylguanosine cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, and introns are removed via RNA splicing.Section 3.6 The Genetic Code l The \"genetic code\" refers to which amino acids correspond to a sequence of processed mRNA. l The eukaryotic ribosome translates an mRNA transcript in the 5\u2032 \u2192 3\u2032 direction and begins at the start codon, AUG. This codon is found within a larger sequence Viruses have evolved many tactics to take advantage of the cellular transcription and translation machinery. Viruses use cellular transcription, RNA processing, and translation mechanisms to ensure the translation of their proteins. They also interfere with the transcription, RNA processing, and translation of host gene products to ensure the preferential translation of viral products. ",
