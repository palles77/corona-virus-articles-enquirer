Dengue is the most widespread of all mosquito-borne viral infections, with a 30-fold increase in incidence over past 50 y. Almost half of the world's population is at risk in >100 dengueendemic countries. The Asia-Pacific region is most heavily affected, but spread to new areas is occurring (2, 8) . Yellow fever 200,000 cases/y; 30,000 deaths; DALYs <5/100,000 in 2010",

            "text": "Global targets and commitments: Inclusion of yellow fever vaccine in national childhood routine immunization programs administered at 9 mo of age, combined with the implementation of mass preventive vaccination campaigns to rapidly increase the population's immunity and to protect susceptible older age groups in selected high risk areas. Yellow fever is endemic to 45 countries of tropical Africa and Latin America and 900 million persons are at risk. The Yellow Fever Initiative is a joint collaboration of WHO and UNICEF, with the participation of national governments, and supported by the GAVI Alliance. Key partners include global public health agencies, industry, and others. It aims to prevent yellow fever epidemics in targeted countries through support for routine immunization, preventive mass vaccination, surveillance and outbreak response capacity, boosting vaccine production, and ensuring adequate vaccine stockpiling (2, 9) . Global targets and commitments: Global Vaccine Action Plan: \"improve health by extending by 2020 and beyond the full benefits of immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are, or where they live.\" Specific goals: Achieve a world free of poliomyelitis; meet vaccination coverage targets in every region, country, and community; exceed the MDG4 target for reducing deaths of children; meet global and regional elimination targets; and develop and introduce new and improved vaccines and technologies (2, 7, 16) . Influenza 5%-10% annual attack rate globally in adults; 20%-30% in children; 508,000 deaths in 2010; DALYs: 279/100,000 in 2010 WHO advises that country-specific information about risk groups, disease incidence, and cost-effectiveness are needed to aid national policy makers and health program planners in making informed decisions about target groups and timing for vaccination. For countries considering initiation or expansion of programs for seasonal influenza vaccination, WHO recommends that pregnant women should have the highest priority. Additional risk groups to be considered for vaccination, in no particular order of priority, are children 6-59 mo of age, the elderly, persons with specific chronic medical conditions, and health care workers (2, 7, 17) .",
