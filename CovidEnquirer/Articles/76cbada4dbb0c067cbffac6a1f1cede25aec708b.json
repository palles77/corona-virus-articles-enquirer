The purpose of this study was to analyze the patterns of adult and pediatric patients who visited the emergency department (ED) during the outbreak. This retrospective study was conducted by analyzing changes in the patterns of visits among adult and pediatric patients in the ED at one tertiary teaching hospital in Korea. The study was performed from June 1, 2013 to July 31, 2015. The MERS outbreak period was from June 1 to July 31, 2015, and we compared that period to the same periods in 2013 and 2014. We compared and analyzed the patients' characteristics, emergency severity index (ESI) level at the visit, cause of visit, diagnosis, final dispositions, injury/non-injury, length of stay at the ED (EDLOS), and hospitalization rate. A total of 9,107 patients visited the ED during this period. Of these patients, 2,572 (28.2%) were pediatric patients and 6,535 (71.8%) were adult patients. The most common cause of an ED visit was fever (adult patients: 21.6%, pediatric patients: 56.2%). The proportion of non-urgent visits involving an ESI level of 4 or 5 and the EDLOS decreased significantly in pediatric and adult patients in comparison to that during the past two years. This change was significant in pediatric patients. Among adult patients, the rate of injury decreased, whereas it increased among pediatric patients. During the MERS outbreak period, pediatric ED visits due to non-urgent cases decreased significantly and there were more pronounced differences in ED utilization patterns in pediatric patients than in adult patients.",

In that study, the number of pediatric ED patients suddenly increased by 19.7% during the H1N1 outbreak in comparison to an increase of 1% in adult patients (9) . This sudden increase in the use of EDs was caused by a fear of the flu in which the media played a major role. Rubinson et al. (21) also showed that there was a 31% increase in the number of ED patients during the H1N1 epidemic. In 1987, during a Approximately 25%-30% of the patients who visit the ED are trauma patients, and the severity of trauma patients requiring hospitalization is greater in adults than in children (18) . During the MERS outbreak period, the proportion of non-trauma patients who visited the adult ED increased by 1.4%, whereas the percentage of trauma patients increased by 4.1% in the pediatric ED. This is thought that pediatric or adolescent trauma patients could not be easily treated in primary medical institutions in Korea.",

One study showed that during the H1N1 outbreak, ED visits for influenza-like illness peaked quickly in the first week of the outbreak and remained high for approximately 6 weeks (6). The reason why ED visits recovered so quickly was that the Korean government declared that the MERS outbreak had ended on July 28th and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that MERS was no longer likely to spread in Korea (26, 27) . When there were no newly reported infected patients, the anxiety about the MERS infection significantly decreased and patients visited the ED regularly as before. Also, our hospital had no infected MERS patients, so when the end of MERS was declared, ED visits resumed normal. It is possible that other EDs may not recovered as quickly. The results are limited to the interpretation as a result of a single hospital study. Therefore, it is necessary to study the number of patient visits to the ED after MERS in various local hospitals.",

Because the patients in our study were enrolled at only one tertiary hospital, the results cannot reflect the characteristics of all ED patients in Korea. Future research is suggested, and a re-evaluation of all the data from emergency rooms at tertiary educational institutions in Korea during the same period is necessary. The analysis of data from the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) is needed. Second, there might be unmeasured confounding factors that could have affected the outcomes such as an underlying disease. Third, the ESI level that we used might not completely reflect the true disease severity, as it is sorted based on the initial assessment of the acuity level, followed by the expected resource needs.",
