The study population was 257,564 dogs vaccinated in 169 hospitals in 13 US metropolitan areas during a 24-month period. Using a scan statistic for population rate data, significant space-time clusters were identified involving the Atlanta and Tampa/St. Petersburg areas during a 4-month period. Separate spatial-temporal analyses of these cities using coordinates for individual address coordinates identified one significant patient cluster (P = 0.002), associated with a 23.26 km-radius area in Atlanta (20 adverse events in 702 dogs; 2.85%) from November 2002 through February 2003. This percentage of adverse events was significantly increased after adjustment for host-related factors and the number of concurrent vaccinations.",

Trends in reports of vaccine-associated events (VAE) may be related to the immunogenicity of the vaccine, improper administration of a vaccine, a veterinarian's or owner's perception of an association between the event and vaccination, and/or the inclination of the veterinarian or owner to initiate a report.

Clusters of VAEs in time may occur with the administration of a newly marketed vaccine or a new batch/lot of routinely used vaccines.

These events were consistent with immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions, and increased risk was associated with body weight less than 10 kg, age approximately one to 3 years of age, and being surgically neutered. Dogs receiving multiple vaccines at one encounter were also at increased risk of VAEs. Because rabies vaccination of dogs is commonly required by local or state authorities, rabies vaccine is often administered alone or concurrently with other vaccines to pet dogs. Patient risk factors and/or practice vaccination protocols may therefore influence the occurrence and potential clustering of reported VAEs. The purpose of this study was to determine if practitioner-diagnosed adverse events occurring within 3 days of canine rabies vaccine administration are clustered in space and time.",

Data sets of the MHG populations were evaluated separately for spatial, temporal, and spatial-temporal clusters of accumulated VAE. Clusters, a geographically bounded group of events of sufficient size and concentration to be unlikely to have occurred by chance [8] , were identified using the space-time scan statistic. This statistic, defined by a cylindrical window composed of a circular geographic base and height corresponding to time [9] , imposes overlapping circles of different location and size on the map, each of which is a potential cluster. The scan statistic calculates the expected number of cases within the scanning window based on either a Poisson (rate data) or Bernoulli (case-control data) distribution. For analyses of the large MHG populations, the distribution of VAEs was assumed to be Poisson. Scanning for clusters included spatial and temporal dimensions ranging from 0 up to 25% of the study area and/or study period. The selected time precision for temporal and space-time analyses was 1 month, e.g. calculated VAE rates per month. Data sets were scanned for clusters with only increased rates of VAE occurrence (equivalent to a one-sided statistical test) in time, space, and space-and-time. A likelihood-ratio test statistic was calculated, based on the maximum likelihood function, for each cluster of adverse events identified. Its distribution and corresponding P-value were obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation-randomly generating 999 replications of the data set under the null hypothesis of spatial and temporal randomness. The rank of the maximum likelihood from the real data set was compared with the maximum likelihoods from the random data sets. If this rank is R, then P = R/(1 + 999 simulations). The P-value was an indicator of the evidence for a real cluster in the 1000 test statistics calculated. In addition to the most likely cluster, any other identified cluster was reported if the associated P-value was statistically significant and if it did not overlap with the most likely cluster.",

This was useful to compare the sensitivity of the Poisson model assumption for aggregated data to that of the Bernoulli method.
