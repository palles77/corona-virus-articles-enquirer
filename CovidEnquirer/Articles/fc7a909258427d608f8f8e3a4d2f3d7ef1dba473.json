Occasionally, a more dynamic level of control is required to properly detect an emerging disease in a community. Dynamic querying features are invaluable when using existing surveillance systems to investigate outbreaks of newly emergent diseases or to identify cases of reportable diseases within data being captured for surveillance. The objective of the Advance Querying Tool (AQT) is to build a more flexible query interface for most web-based disease surveillance systems. This interface allows users to define and build their query as if they were writing a logical expression for a mathematical computation. The AQT allows users to develop, investigate, save, and share complex case definitions. It provides a flexible interface that accommodates both advanced and novice users, checks the validity of the expression as it is built, and marks errors for users.",

The early detection of known and emerging illnesses is becoming more important. Automated disease surveillance systems have been in existence for over 10 years [2] [3] [4] . Most of these systems analyze data by syndrome and search for disease outbreaks. A syndrome in this context is defined as a group of diseases related in some fashion, such as respiratory diseases. This level of investigation is often sufficient, but a more dynamic level of control may be required to understand an emerging illness in a community.",

In this case, the users needed to create queries that looked for specific keywords in the patient chief complaint or specific combinations of ICD-9 codes [7] . A chief complaint is text entered by a triage professional in an emergency room or a clinic, based on a patient's description of their primary symptoms. Today's public health departments must deal with a multitude of data coming from a variety of sources. For example, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data include sources such as radiology, laboratory, and pharmacy data. A more sophisticated querying tool is needed to assist investigators with creating inquiries across multiple data sources [8] [9] [10] .",

However, we wanted to design a flexible and simple graphical user interface (GUI) for this and other types of surveillance systems. Our prototype system, the Advanced Querying Tool (AQT), allows the investigators to handle complex cases where one can incorporate any data elements available in a disease surveillance system, then mix and match these data elements in order to define valid queries. Hence, this system removes the need for database administrators and application developers to define pre-packaged database queries and user interfaces every time a new and innovative query is written.",

Table 1 provides examples of how a dynamic query tool exploits combinations of data elements available to disease surveillance systems. Most automated disease surveillance systems have a fixed number of predefined syndromes. These applications severely limit the surveillance system value for diseases that fall outside of its broad syndrome categories. The background noise level rises when all the chief complaints that potentially fall into a syndrome category are included, which in turn requires many more positive cases to identify an abnormal condition. Merely adding sub-syndrome categories, that are more granular than syndromes and cover a broader range of conditions than typical syndromic surveillance like injures and chronic disease [12] , provides the users with a more comprehensive means to filter the analysis window. If a disease surveillance system has 400 sub-syndromes, then taken singly the user has 400 additional choices; by combining two or three sub-syndromes, the analysis options are magnified to over ten million choices. Of course not all of these options are sensible, so the actual number of options is somewhat less. Even greater analytic flexibility is provided through the use of data elements contained within electronic medical records. The capability to select a combination of a microbiology laboratory result, radiology result, and ICD-9 code provides for a powerful tool that enables the public health community to rapidly identify specific high risk patients.

Unlike fixed-form query interfaces, AQT will not restrict users in what they can query. Instead, the user will be able to formulate ad-hoc queries across assorted data sources without the need to understand the underlying data models and the query languages associated with different systems. In addition, using this tool should save investigators' valuable time in obtaining the query results. Currently, if the surveillance system cannot generate the desired queries, the application developers and/or database administrators may have to create new interfaces or functionalities. The AQT, however, empowers the users to move forward with their research without waiting for developer or administrator modifications to the surveillance systems.",

AQT will provide an interface for disease surveillance systems to store, retrieve, and share queries.

As mentioned earlier, a main objective of the AQT is to provide an interface that caters to both novice and experienced users. The experienced users simply type the query, while beginners and those who are more comfortable with a guided interface can use list boxes and buttons to generate the queries. In fact, one can type part of the query and use the tool to generate the rest of the query (Figure 4) . When a user types a query directly, it is assumed that the user knows the syntax and valid data elements pertaining to the data source, though the tool does check the syntax and provide feedback. Because we want the users to define and build their query as if they were writing a logical expression for a mathematical computation, the syntax is simple and close to the \"where\" clause of a Structure Query Language (SQL) statement. However, one does not need to know SQL to write the expressions. A query consists of one or more simple expressions joined by \"AND\" and/or \"OR,\" negated by \"NOT,\" and grouped by parentheses. A simple expression is enclosed within square brackets ([]) and defined by a variable, a logical operator, and a value. For example, if an investigator is searching for reported fever cases within a specified zip code, the query then consists of two simple expressions; one which searches for the specified zip code and the other which checks the fever syndrome.

Because data elements such as zip codes and ICD-9 codes have a lot of values for dropdown lists, finding a particular value in these list boxes is very cumbersome. The tool provides an intermediate step for filtering these options into a more manageable list (Figure 9 ). For example, if the investigators are interested in data from certain zip codes in a state, they can reduce the options by typing the first two digits of the zip code and thereby filtering the list. The tool will generate valid expressions and provide a mechanism to check the query expressions when a user types parts or all of them. Every time an expression is generated by the tool and the Add Expression button is clicked, the tool examines the entire query expression, checking it against the syntax rules. Before saving or executing the expression the AQT automatically checks the syntax and if it detects any syntax errors it will provide meaningful error messages in the message area ( Figure 10) . Additionally, at any point the user can click on the validate button and check the syntax. Frequently, investigators want to execute a query over time, run the same query with different values, or use the query inside more complex queries. Similarly as all the other data elements (zip code, syndrome, region, etc.), the permanent storage and retrieval of queries (File system, database, or any other mechanism) are the responsibility of the disease surveillance system. The AQT is merely an interface to assist the investigators with their research by hiding the complexity and inner workings of the underlying data model.",

The surveillance system should implement the inner workings of the permanent storage and retrieval of public queries. The next step is retrieving these saved queries. There are two options in the data element list box in the query builder section of the AQT: one option is for retrieving the private saved queries, and the other option is for retrieving public saved queries ( Figure 12 ).

The previous capability allowed the user to base the custom query on Data Source, Geography System, or Medical Grouping System, however, since the selections were not part of the query statement they could not be modified without returning to the pre-selection screens and re-starting the query process.

What this study added to our knowledge \u2022 Electronic disease surveillance systems need a more sophisticated querying tool to assist public health investigators in conducting inquires across multiple data sources. \u2022 Superior analytic flexibility through the use of data elements contained within electronic medical records enables the public health community to rapidly identify specific high risk patients. \u2022 The Advanced Querying Tool (AQT) was designed as a flexible and simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to develop, investigate, and share complex case definitions.",
