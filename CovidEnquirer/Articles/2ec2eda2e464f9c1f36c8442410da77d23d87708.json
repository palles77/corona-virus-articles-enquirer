Compared with the traditional chitosan microspheres, the microspheres could quickly release intact and penetrative PEI/DNA complexes. What's more, chitosan was modified with mannose to target the primary APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) owing to the high density of mannose receptors expressing on the surface of immature DCs. After i.m. immunization, the microspheres induced significantly enhanced serum antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in comparison to naked DNA.",

Despite the availability of an effective vaccine for more than two decades, hepatitis B remains one of the 10 most common causes of death worldwide. Recovery from acute hepatitis B is the result of a combination of cellular and humoral immune responses. After recovery, HBV-specific T cells persist in the blood for decades [1] . In contrast, in chronic HBV infection, HBV-specific cellular immune responses are typically weak, narrowly focused, and rarely detectable in the peripheral blood [2] [3] [4] [5] . It has been suggested that therapeutic induction of HBV-specific cellular immune responses may lead to recovery from chronic hepatitis B [3] . However, currently traditional immuno-therapeutic approaches do not induce HBV-specific cellular immunity. Data demonstrating that cellular antiviral immunity can be induced following genetic immunization with plasmid DNA encoding HBV antigens have inspired novel approaches for vaccine construction [3] [4] [5] . The use of DNA vaccines in preclinical studies has been well established, with reports of both antibody and CTL responses in multiple independent studies [6] . Nevertheless, DNA vaccines have been met with limited success in both nonhuman primate models and human volunteers and often require multiple high dose immunizations [7] . For reasons such as potency, production, cost, and safety, there is a clear need to induce effective immunity in humans with lower and fewer doses of DNA, as well as to increase the magnitude of the immune response obtained.",

            "text": "There are a number of strategies available that have the potential to improve the potency of DNA vaccines. Several groups have attempted to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines using cationic microparticles [8] , chitosan [9] , nonionic block co-polymers [10] and cationic liposomes [11, 12] as gene vectors. Although such approaches have had some success, they are far from ideal for enhancing cellular immunity because activation of T-cell responses requires antigen presentation by professional APCs. Targeting phagocytic APCs has resulted in more efficient immune activation than direct injection of equivalent amounts of free antigen [13] . For example, biodegradable microspheres are efficiently phagocytosed by macrophages (M\u03a6s) and capable of inducing a cytotoxic T cell response in vivo [14] [15] [16] . These spheres in the range of 1-10 \u03bcm are too large to enter cells via endocytosis, and therefore passively \"target\" phagocytic cells such as DCs by size exclusion. Goh et al demonstrated that MHC-I restricted antigen presentation can be enhanced by using spheres that rapidly degrade in the lysosome leading to disruption of the lysosome. This leads to IL-6 secretion and a response approximately 40-fold higher than that achieved with DNA alone [17] .",

Base on these ideas, we have developed a novel approach to prepare mannose-bearing chitosan biodegradable microspheres with entrapping PEI/DNA complexes in order to enhance delivery of DNA to APCs after i.m. injection. The use of microsphere systems based on biodegradable polymers such as chitosan can provide sustained pharmacological activity of DNA vaccines. Chitosan is a polycationic, biodegradable natural polymer with an extensive record of safe use for gene delivery systems [18, 19] . However, previous research described the entrapment of naked DNA inside the unmodified chitosan microspheres. There might be some disadvantages to these systems, such as the following: (i) the low in vivo and in vitro expression levels suggest that chitosan is unable to mediate lysosomal escape possibly due to limited buffering capacity. (ii) Being insoluble in aqueous media due to its crystalline structure, chitosan forms a very viscous solution even at low concentrations, and is only soluble in water containing acetic acid which may induce cytotoxicity [20, 21] . (iii) Once en-trapped in microspheres, the rate of release of DNA is slow, limiting the amount of DNA available for transfection of target cells and induction of immune responses. The limited life span of APCs requires the release of the encapsulated material in a reasonable time frame.",

This increased the hydrogen bonding between the mannonyl group and solvent and disturbed the hydrogen bonding between amino groups and N-acetyl groups of chitosan. Furthermore, microspheres attached with mannose can target the DCs and be internalized via recognition by the mannose receptor on the DC surface.

Chitosan and its derivatives, synthesized in this study, were soluble in an aqueous acidic solution below pH 6.5.

In our case, it was evident that m-chitosan derivatives were soluble in a slightly broader range of pH than u-chitosan. What's more, the pH range was extended as the DS increased, indicating that the enhanced hydrophilicity was attributed to the mannonyl group (Data not shown).

In this study, u-chitosan and m-chitosan were incubated with lysozyme-containing acetate buffer (pH = 5.0) at 37\u00b0C. A decrease in the viscosity of the polymer solution, resulting from the enzymatic degradation, was investigated as a function of time (Fig. 1) . No significant decrease in viscosity was observed in the u-chitosan solution within 90 min (b10%), whereas the solution of mchitosan exhibited the rapid decrease in the viscosity just after 10 min due to hydrolysis in the presence of lysozyme ( p b 0.001). The preservation of the viscosity of the u-chitosan solution can be attributed to the fact that u-chitosan has a small amount of N-acetylglucosamine residues that are susceptible to lysozyme. It was of interest that the m-chitosan derivatives with a higher DS showed a higher degradation rate, indicating that the mannonyl moieties in the chitosan enhanced the susceptibility to lysozyme (Data not shown).

For naked DNA, the peak level of gene expression in muscle was found 1.7-2.5-fold lower than u-chitosan or mchitosan microspheres (Fig. 5) . Manthope et al [30] have demonstrated the rapid loss of plasmid from muscle after injection of plasmid. Their studies showed that greater than 95% of the plasmid appeared to be degraded by 90 min postinjection, as determined by Southern blotting. Thus, the very low transfection efficiency coupled with the rapid degradation and elimination of DNA from the muscle suggests that nuclease mediated degradation is a rate-limiting step for gene delivery into muscle cells. For chitosan microspheres, the hydrophobic nature of the chitosan may offer protection to the encapsulated DNA from nuclease attack. This increased stability may explain the increased levels of gene expression observed at days 7 and 14.",

In contrast, m-chitosan microspheres were effective at 1 \u03bcg, indicating a N10 fold increase in DNA vaccine potency, based on the lowest dose of DNA required to prime a measurable response. The m-chitosan microspheres may increase the humoral response of naked DNA by extending its longevity in release kinetics and half-time. In addition, m- chitosan microspheres accelerated the antibody responses (data not shown). The detectable antibody responses against HBsAg were achieved within 5 weeks after injection of naked DNA at a 10 \u03bcg dose, whereas only 3 weeks were required for m-chitosan microspheres at the same dose. This acceleration by 2 weeks is statistically significant, and is of clinical interest whenever a rapid immune response is critical. In the past years, outbreaks of Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza A have increased demands for vaccination strategies that rapidly induce immunity [31, 32] .
