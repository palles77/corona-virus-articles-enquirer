The Congo River/Forest Basin has been shown to be one of the 'hot spots' for emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. For example, in the recent past in Uganda alone, there have been outbreaks of Ebola, yellow fever, and anthrax. The Health Alliance, an existing network of six schools of public health from six countries in this hot spot (Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ethiopia) worked to strengthen public health education and systems, including emergency preparedness and response. After collaborating across universities (with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) support) for 5 years, the Health Alliance, recognizing that 60% of new, emerging, or reemerging diseases have animal origins, sought to widen its scope to evolve into a One Health network to more effectively combat the spread of these diseases (One Health Commission, 2016; OHCEA, 2015) .",

Calvin Schwabe Made many important contributions to veterinary epidemiology over his career. He established Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at the Veterinary School, the first department of its kind at a veterinary school. In 1964 he wrote a monograph (Veterinary Medicine and Human Health) in which he proposed that veterinary and human health professionals should collaborate to combat zoonotic diseases and coined the term 'One Medicine' which emphasizes the similarities between human and veterinary medicine.

The PMAC hosted the 1st Global Conference on regional disease surveillance networks and the 2nd International One Health Congress Centennial Commemoration of the Rockefeller Foundation. One of the main objectives of the conference was to foster cooperation and communication across sectors and across borders to mitigate the threat of infectious diseases, existing or emerging, at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. reemerging infectious diseases. These countries are DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda with the regional secretariat located at the Makerere University School of Public Health in Kampala, Uganda. OHCEA has increased its reach to West Africa, with the addition of Cameroon and Senegal. The current institutional membership of OHCEA by country and university, as of 2016, is shown in Table 2 . In each member country, the OHCEA team is spearheaded by schools of public health and schools of veterinary medicine and includes high engagement of government ministries, such as those responsible for health, agriculture, food, livestock, fisheries, education, wildlife, and disaster management and response. OHCEA received a 5-year-subaward funding for implementation of activities funded through the University of Minnesota on an award from USAID for the implementation of the One Health Workforce (OHW) Project. This project will facilitate government-led, university-driven, network-supported coordination and collaboration across all levels of the human and animal health sectors essential to meet the Global Health Security Agenda vision for \"a world safe and secure from global health threats posed by infectious diseases\" (OHCEA, 2015) .",

In 2011 the two schools expanded its membership to schools of veterinary medicine in the region to form what became known as OHCEA. The mission of LIPHEA was leadership in management of disasters and personnel training. The activities of LIPHEA were funded by USAID through the Higher Education until 2009. The main US partner in the LIPHEA team was the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (OHCEA, 2015; USAID, 2014a; One Health Commission, 2016) . Inspired by the evolution of One Health, LIPHEA invited schools of veterinary medicine in the region to join hands in the formation of OHCEA which gradually moved from disaster preparedness and response to OHW strengthening in participating countries. Based on opportunities available within the EPT program, OHCEA quickly became engaged with OHW strengthening in the participating countries.",

Representatives of 111 countries and 29 international organizations, 4-6 December 2007 Met in New Delhi, India, for the International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza. During this meeting, governments were encouraged to further develop the One Health concept by building linkages between human and animal health systems for pandemic preparedness and human security. International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in New Delhi (2008) In response to the recommendations of the previous International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in New Delhi, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and the United Nations System Influenza Coordination (UNSIC) came together in 2008 to develop a document titled, 'Contributing to One World, One Health. A Strategic Framework for Reducing Risks of Infectious Diseases at the Animal-Human-Ecosystem Interface.' The framework built on the lessons learned from the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza response during the early 2000s and presented a strategy for applying the One Health concept to emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) at the animal-human-ecosystem interface.
