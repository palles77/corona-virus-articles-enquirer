Recent events such as the 2004 Asian Tsunami, which resulted in more than 700 patients arriving at Patong Hospital in Phuket, Thailand, within 2 hours, 1 and the 1995 sarin attack in Tokyo, China, which resulted in 500 patients at St. Luke's Hospital within 1 hour, 2 emphasize the need for ED staff to plan and prepare their response to the particular hazards they are at risk for and the potential patient surge that may be generated. This planning, like direct patient care, needs to be driven by more than educated guesses. Careful utilization of current available evidence will help build a strong foundation to serve as the basis for evidence-based ED disaster planning.",

Applying EBM to disaster research is challenging because of a lack of standard terminology and data collection methods, incomplete medical records, and research that is retrospective in nature. 4 Whereas disaster events may not allow for the collection of controlled, experimental data, there is available evidence that can be applied in ED disaster-planning processes. Using current evidence to support or suggest alterations in ED disaster planning will strengthen overall ED preparedness.

In a makeshift patient care area for ED overflow, 38 of 83 staff workers (45.8%) became exposed to sarin. 2 The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-2003 also resulted in significant staff exposures. During the first wave of SARS in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 51% (n = 73) of the patients who contracted SARS were hospital staff. In the second wave, health care workers comprised 39% of cases (n = 29) in which SARS developed. 5 In Taiwan 33% of all SARS cases were health care workers. 6 The US Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry collects information from 15 cooperating state health departments related to incidents involving the release of hazardous materials through its Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) system. 7 The HSEES study of US hazardous material events breaks down the events based on whether the incident occurred in a rural setting or \"other area\" setting. The \"other area\" category includes more populated residential, industrial, and commercial areas; thus it includes urban populated areas.",

Of the 889 patients in the urban setting needing decontamination, 170 were first responders and 342 were hospital staff. These events show that a significant portion of the patients who needed treatment are hospital staff who have become exposed during the decontamination process. Of the total number of patients who needed decontamination in these events, hospital staff represented 23% of the total patients in rural settings and 38% in urban settings. 8 Whether the hazardous event is large or small, the emergency department will most likely lose staff who become exposed to the agent (Figure 1 ), which impacts ED function with decreased staff numbers and increased patient loads. To protect ED staff, there must be clear procedures for dealing with potentially exposed or contaminated patients. This begins with proper assessment of a patient in need of isolation or decontamination and includes understanding what personal protective equipment (PPE) is appropriate. The ED disaster plan must include rapid relocation of the patient from the waiting room to either an isolation room or a decontamination area.",

Large-scale decontamination systems have the capability of handling large numbers of patients but often lack the capability of being immediately operational. Patients arrive rapidly to the emergency department after exposure events. In the Tokyo sarin event, patients arrived at St. Luke's Emergency Department within 12 minutes of the first hospital notification that there had been an event. 2 Large decontamination systems may not be needed because evidence suggests that small numbers of patients (between 5 and 15) usually require hospital decontamination. 8 For ED planning, this means that a scalable decontamination process, one that can start small and then immediately ramp up over time, is needed. Emergency departments should use multiple showerheads in their decontamination rooms in addition to outside systems that may range from garden hoses with nozzles to fixed shower systems concreted in place. Decontamination procedures can start immediately with the first arrival of patients, and if the event escalates, the decontamination process continues at the initial sites until the large showers are assembled and ready to go.",

            "text": "A lesson learned from the sarin attack in the Tokyo subways is that staff will have difficulty identifying the chemical agent involved in the exposure. At 8:28 AM, the first patients arrived at Tokyo's St. Luke's Emergency Department. At 9:00 AM, the emergency department received initial notification that the Tokyo Fire Department had identified the chemical (incorrectly) as acetonitrile. At 9:40 AM, a medical doctor with experience from the previous sarin attack in Matsumoto, Japan, called to advise medical staff to suspect sarin, and the hospital began treating patients with the appropriate MARK 1 sarin antidote kits at that time. It was not until 11:00 AM that the hospital was notified that police analysis had identified the chemical as sarin and the ED staff received that information while watching the television news. 9 Because scene reports may be delayed or inaccurate and laboratory confirmation takes time, ED staff must be knowledgeable about the presenting signs and symptoms of the various types of agents and infectious diseases. Information from patients about the event and their signs and symptoms will be the primary sources of data that ED personnel receive to determine what agent the patients may have been exposed to. Staff must have the ability to start decontamination or isolation procedures as soon as they are suspicious that an exposure occurred, and this clinical suspicion needs to be based in appropriate training. Training needs to include not only basic classes reviewing agent characteristics but also the application of that knowledge into practical considerations, such as how and when to implement ED response procedures. This can be accomplished through interactive classes, role playing, and regular drilling. It is crucial that the ED charge nurses have regular practice with the decision-making steps that they will need to perform when they believe a patient has been exposed to a chemical or infectious agent. Staff should not experience repercussions for \"jumping the gun\" if their suspicions of contamination turn out to be erroneous. In Toronto, ED staff were unaware of the SARS events taking place in Hong Kong and China, because of a lack of international health alerts about SARS. 5 As a result, ED personnel did not know what pertinent questions were needed in the triage assessment (e.g., travel history). Hospitals must ensure that their personnel has up-to-date information to correctly identify and isolate contaminated patients. This consists of maintaining access to health alerts through systems such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Health Alert Network. These alerts should be monitored daily to ensure dissemination to the ED staff.",

Enclosed bombings, such as bus bombings, tend to cause a greater number of fatalities and a greater number of patients with life-threatening injuries because of the amplification of the blast. One study shows a 42% intubation rate for bus bombings compared with a 7% intubation rate for openair bombings. 20 As Figure 4 shows, this typically translates to 7 to 20 patients who will require intubation from a blast event. Surge planning should, therefore, incorporate airway considerations and include the involvement of hospital respiratory therapists. Airway supplies should be rapidly available and include either immediate access to traditional ventilators or disposable ventilators for temporary use.",

The teams often arrive late and leave their hospitals with less coverage. EMS usually has well-established and well-drilled mass casualty plans that do not include the use of an ad hoc team; the arrival of uncoordinated volunteers on the scene detracts from scene coordination rather than enhancing it. The hospital teams might be better utilized by staying at their hospital or moving to more heavily impacted hospitals unless specifically requested by EMS. EMS should then have a clear plan in place to maximize the use of the teams by directing them to patients needing critical medical interventions.",

There were 668 total SARS admissions during the Taiwan outbreak (March-July 2003) and 375 total cases in Toronto (March-June 2003). 5, 22 However, there were also decreases in ED visits and overall bed occupancy during these time periods, attributed in part to people avoiding the risk of becoming infected during a hospital visit. Comparing pre-SARS data and data collected during the SARS event, National Taiwan University Hospital noted a 63% decrease in ED visits, and overall bed occupancy decreased from 86% to 38%. 23 Similarly, China Medical University Hospital noted a 33.4% decrease in ED visits, and among 15 hospitals, there was an overall decrease of 19.9% in bed occupancy. 24, 25 Canada's Hospital for Sick Children found a mean decrease of 27% in patient volume in their emergency department during the SARS epidemic. 26 SARS resulted in staff shortages, primarily in the emergency department and ICU, because of potential exposures, quarantine, and staff choosing not to report to work. However, the documented decrease in ED visits and hospital admissions, noted previously, can help alleviate this shortage. Disaster plans should incorporate closure of a portion of the hospital's general non-isolation beds; staff and supplies from these areas should be used to support the new surge isolation units and the emergency department, which will need to cover staff shortages and will require additional personnel to staff an outside screening center.",

Large-scale events are going to disrupt the infrastructure that supports both civilian and medically used communication systems. Surviving hospital communication systems will be overwhelmed with incoming calls from the community. Even relatively small events (e.g., bombings) will cause a failure in the local communication system. ED communication planning must have backup plans in place that do not rely on public phone or cell phone systems. Simple 2-way handheld radios (walkie-talkies) should be in place to use during communication failure; these types of radios need no outside source (e.g., a cell phone tower) to operate. Runners are still an effective way to communicate during a system failure, but runners must be assigned to that role and there should be at least 1 assigned to each independent area.",
