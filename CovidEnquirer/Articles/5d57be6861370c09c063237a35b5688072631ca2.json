            "text": "Reporting these three clinical cases had the purpose to highlight the acute presentation of AFOP as a particular lung disease more recently described, initially confused with pneumonia, running with severe respiratory failure and immediate need for mechanic ventilation, with no response to antibiotics or steroids. More clinical and radiographical data are needed to characterize this controversial entity and to understand how it can be dealt with to improve patients' management, supported by the apparent correlation of both diagnostic images of CT and histopathology. These studies would emphasize guidelines to establish the surgical biopsy timing and correspondent morphological interpretation.",
