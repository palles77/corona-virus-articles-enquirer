The image identified an obvious ''hotspot'' corresponding to the area of tenderness over the distal radius ( Fig. 1) , which clearly differed from a thermal image of the normal wrist (Fig. 2) . Subsequent X-ray of the wrist revealed an undisplaced greenstick fracture of the distal radius. The child was treated with a plaster cast, referred to the orthopaedic fracture clinic and made an uneventful recovery.",

It has been shown to be useful in aiding diagnosis and guiding management of foot injuries in military recruits when combined with clinical examination, radiographs and bone scanning. 4 Telethermography has been demonstrated as a useful tool in aiding diagnosis and management of sports injuries. 5 Cole et al. demonstrated a significant relationship between early thermographic assessment of the depth of skin burns and clinical outcome. 3 Various types of thermal imaging have also been used in studies of diabetic neuropathic feet, 1 the detection of carpal tunnel syndrome, 7 the investigation of tendon injuries in horses 6 ity's sensitivity for identifying passengers with even low grade pyrexia (>37.5 8C) highlights recent technological advances and brings to attention future possible uses. The main problems previously identified with the use of thermal imaging in the evaluation of a possibly injured limb include a lack of specificity in identifying the site and nature of pathology and difficulty in establishing normal references. While thermography could never replace radiography as a diagnostic tool, it may be useful as an adjunct to clinical examination and X-ray. As this case demonstrates, children can prove difficult to assess in the accident and emergency department environment. Injury localisation in this patient group can prove difficult and the ''survey'' of a limb with X-ray may result. The use of thermal imaging could improve the sensitivity of clinical examination and therefore assist in injury localisation, preventing unnecessary X-ray exposure.",

This is an early response and if it was shown to be reliable then the modality may be useful in a wider area of emergency medicine. Early radiological findings can be unreliable in conditions such as scaphoid fracture and the ''toddler's'' type fracture of the tibial shaft. Thermal imaging could potentially be used in early follow-up to exclude fracture in these situations and prevent prolonged immobilisation and possibly more invasive and expensive bone scanning. It is likely that thermal imaging would be of use when examining bones that are relatively superficial where temperature changes are going to be more apparent.",
