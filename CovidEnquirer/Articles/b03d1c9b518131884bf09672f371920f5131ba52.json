            "text": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of free-access acidified milk replacer feeding on the pre-and postweaning health of dairy and veal calves. Individually housed calves were systematically assigned at birth to 1 of 2 feeding programs: free-access feeding (ad libitum) of acidified milk replacer (ACD, n = 249) or traditional restricted feeding (3 L fed twice daily) of milk replacer (RES, n = 249). Calves were fed milk replacer containing 24% crude protein and 18% fat. Acidified milk replacer was prepared to a target pH between 4.0 and 4.5 using formic acid. Calves were weaned off milk replacer at approximately 6 wk of age. Weaning occurred over 5 d, and during this weaning period, ACD calves had access to milk replacer for 12 h/d and RES calves were offered only one feeding of milk replacer (3 L) daily. Calves were monitored daily for signs of disease. Fecal consistency scores were assigned each week from birth until weaning. A subset of calves was systematically selected for fecal sampling at 3 time points between 7 and 27 d of age. Fecal samples were analyzed for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F5, Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, and coronavirus. Hip width, hip height, body length, heart girth, and body weight were measured at birth and weaning. Postweaning body weight measurements were collected from the heifers at approximately 8 mo of age. Postweaning body weight and carcass grading information was collected from the veal calves at slaughter once a live weight between 300 and 350 kg had been achieved. The odds of ACD calves being treated for a preweaning disease event tended to be lower than that of the RES calves (1.2 vs. 5.2%, respectively). Preweaning mortality, postweaning disease treatment, and postweaning mortality did not differ between feeding treatments. The ACD feeding treatment supported greater preweaning average daily gain (0.59 vs. 0.43 kg/d) and structural growth than RES feeding. Postweaning average daily gain and carcass characteristics were similar for ACD and RES calves. These results indicate that free-access acidified milk replacer feeding tended to support improved health, and greater body weight gain and structural growth during the preweaning period; these effects did not persist in the postweaning period. The growth advantage observed before weaning in the ACD calves likely disappeared due to the weaning methods used.",

            "text": "Calves on North American dairy and veal farms are generally reared on either a traditional or an enhanced milk feeding program (Drackley, 2008; Khan et al., 2011a) . Traditional feeding programs restrict daily intake of fluid milk to a rate of 8 to 10% of birth BW, with the aim of encouraging solid feed consumption and facilitating earlier weaning (Drackley, 2008) . In contrast, enhanced milk feeding strategies allow calves to consume larger quantities of whole milk or high protein milk replacer, which better reflect natural feeding conditions, result in fewer behavioral signs of hunger (De Paula Vieira et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2011a) , and support improved growth performance (Diaz et al., 2001; Jasper and Weary, 2002; Quigley et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2007a; Miller-Cushon et al., 2013) . Moreover, it has been documented that increased nutrient intake from milk or milk replacer during the preweaning period and greater preweaning ADG are positively associated with lactation milk yield (Soberon et al., 2012; Soberon and Van Amburgh, 2013) .",

            "text": "Anecdotal reports indicate that free-access acidified milk feeding is an enhanced nutritional program that has been adopted by many dairy and veal calf producers in Canada (Anderson, 2008 (Anderson, , 2011 . In addition, it has recently been reported that acidified milk is fed to calves on 1.7% of farms in the United States (NAHMS, 2016 ). This feeding system aims to achieve ad libitum consumption by using an organic acid to preserve milk so that it can be fed to calves at ambient temperatures in the summer, and at approximately 20 to 24\u00b0C in cold housing. Several commercial acidified milk replacers have been developed and evaluated for ad libitum feeding, with a typical target pH between 5.0 and 5.5 after reconstitution (Stobo, 1983; Davis and Drackley, 1998) . It has been demonstrated that these commercial acidified milk replacers are associated with improved DMI and greater ADG when offered to calves ad libitum, as compared with traditional feeding (Nocek and Braund, 1986; Woodford et al., 1987) . Nocek and Braund (1986) reported that calves fed ad libitum commercial acidified milk replacer had softer manure, likely as a result of consuming a greater proportion of their daily DMI from milk replacer. However, these calves also had a lower incidence of neonatal calf diarrhea complex and required less veterinary care than traditionally fed calves. More recently, a recommended target pH range between 4.0 and 4.5 for the preparation of acidified milk has been proposed (Anderson, 2008 (Anderson, , 2011 . Further research, under field conditions, is needed to determine health and performance effects of feeding acidified milk at this lower recommended target pH.",

Acidified milk replacer was prepared by cooling milk replacer to a temperature of less than 20\u00b0C and then stirring in prediluted formic acid (The Acidified Milk Solution, 9.8% formic acid, NOD Apiary Products Ltd., Frankford, ON, Canada) until a pH between 4.0 and 4.5 was achieved.

The pH tester was cleaned and calibrated weekly using a cleaning solution (Hanna HI 7061 Electrode Cleaning Solution, Hanna Instruments, Laval, QC, Canada) and pH buffer solutions, respectively. Formic acid is not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for acidifying milk or milk replacer. Citric acid is an alternative acidifying agent that could be used in the United States (Hill et al., 2013) . Calves assigned to the ACD feeding program were able to consume unrestricted acidified milk replacer throughout the preweaning period. The ACD calves in the nursery were fed using a teat and bucket feeding system. An artificial teat (Peach Teat, Skellerup Industries, Christchurch, New Zealand) was fastened to the front gate of each ACD pen; calves had continuous access to their teats. Teats were connected by plastic tubes, fitted with 1-way valves to 20-L feeding buckets with lids. The nursery room was arranged so that feeding buckets were shared between 2 neighboring ACD calves. Feeding buckets were filled with acidified milk replacer daily and replenished as needed. All of the feeding buckets were agitated by hand for at least 10 s twice daily. Feeding buckets, teats, and plastic tubes were cleaned and disinfected each time a block of calves exited the nursery.",

Interaction between treatment and week was tested when overall effects were significant. Tukey adjustment was specified to account for multiple comparisons. All of the final models were evaluated for assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality of residuals. Homoscedasticity was assessed by visually examining a scatter-plot of residuals against predicted values. Normality was assessed using histogram and normal probability plots, as well as checking the residuals for skewness and kurtosis. A square-root transformation was applied to improve homoscedasticity and to help normalize distribution of residuals for the BW at weaning model. Back-transformed means and 95% confidence intervals are presented. Model fit was examined by identifying the correlation structure that resulted in the smallest Akaike information criterion. A first-order autoregressive correlation structure was specified for C. parvum shedding, rotavirus shedding, and coronavirus shedding models.",

The RES calves were provided milk replacer at a higher feeding rate (6 L/d, approximately 14% birth BW) than the traditional restricted rate of 8 to 10% birth BW, which may partially explain the smaller than expected difference in ADG between the ACD and RES calves. Preweaning ADG for the ACD and RES calves may have also been underestimated because weaning weights for the calves were not determined until approximately 1 wk after weaning. As calves make the transition from a milk-based to a fully solid feed diet, they will often experience a growth check in the immediate postweaning period (Sweeney et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2011a ).",

Hence, the delay in collecting the weaning measurements may have contributed to the low preweaning ADG. Calves assigned to the ACD treatment group exhibited greater structural growth than the RES calves. Changes in hip height, hip width, and heart girth from birth to weaning for the RES calves were similar to that of other calves reared on conventional milk replacer feeding regimens (Heinrichs et al., 2003; Lesmeister and Heinrichs, 2004) . The ACD calves, however, achieved less preweaning heart girth, body length, and hip height gain than calves reared on step-down milk feeding methods (Khan et al., 2007a (Khan et al., , 2011b . One can speculate that the reported differences in structural characteristics for the ACD calves versus step-down milk-fed calves are due to step-down feeding programs being associated with greater overall growth during the preweaning period. Nonetheless, results of the current study demonstrate that the ACD feeding treatment supported increased structural growth over RES. Moreover, it is unlikely that the 1 wk delay in collecting the weaning measurements would have had an effect on these structural characteristics.",

            "text": "Several factors could have influenced growth of ACD and RES calves. Milk feeding treatment was confounded by feed delivery; ACD calves were fed milk replacer by teat, whereas RES calves were fed milk replacer by bucket. Hammell et al. (1988) reported greater BW gains for calves offered ad libitum intake by a teat than by bucket. Furthermore, acidification with formic acid could have affected palatability of the acidified milk replacer. Calves are known to have a preference for sweet tasting substances, such as whole milk or milk replacer (Hellekant et al., 1994; de Passill\u00e9 and Rushen, 2006) . In another study by our research team, acidification to a target pH between 4.0 and 4.5 resulted in decreased intake by approximately 1 L/d under free access feeding conditions, and resulted in more frequent milk meals (Todd, 2013) . Moreover, Hill et al. (2013) reported that calves fed milk replacer acidified with citric acid to pH 4.2 consumed less milk replacer than those offered milk replacer acidified to pH 5.2. Milk replacer temperature could have also influenced intake and calf growth. Milk replacer for RES calves was mixed fresh at each feeding and was warm when it was offered to these calves. Temperature of the acidified milk replacer was recorded at each weekly visit by the research technicians, and ranged from 13.2 to 27.5\u00b0C, over the study period, due to changes in ambient air conditions. Cold feeding temperatures negatively affect milk replacer intake and subsequent growth performance of calves (Flipot et al., 1972) , which together with variability in feeding temperatures, may account for lower than expected ADG for ACD calves. Unmeasured environmental factors, such as elevated ammonia levels and ventilation quality in the preweaned calf housing facilities, could have also negatively influenced performance during the preweaning phase (Heinrichs et al., 2005; Lundborg et al., 2005; Lago et al., 2006) . Replacement heifers and veal calves reared on the ACD feeding regimen were expected to have greater preweaning ADG and subsequently maintain a BW advantage after weaning over the RES animals. No differences in postweaning growth performance were observed. Enhanced milk feeding has been associated with improved preweaning growth and increased postweaning weight gain in some studies (Khan et al., 2007a,b; Miller-Cushon et al., 2013) , but not others (Jasper and Weary, 2002; Terr\u00e9 et al., 2006; Hill et al., 2013) . Calves that consume ad libitum or large amounts of milk, generally, have lower solid feed intakes (Appleby et al., 2001; Jasper and Weary, 2002; Quigley et al., 2006; Terr\u00e9 et al., 2006; Borderas et al., 2009) , as well as delayed rumen development and function, relative to traditionally fed calves (Terr\u00e9 et al., 2006) .",

In the current study, calves were weaned over a 5-d weaning period to encourage solid feed intake, during which ACD calves had access to ad libitum milk for 12 h/d and RES calves were fed only once daily. Some evidence shows that calves fed ad libitum milk for 4 h/d adjust their feeding behavior and consume milk at rates similar to those when calves have free access throughout the day 723 (von Keyserlingk et al., 2006) . Thus, one can speculate that ACD calves may have continued to consume large amounts of milk until the final day of weaning, resulting in a relatively abrupt wean off milk, a more difficult transition onto solid feed, poor weight gain during the early postweaning period, and underestimated preweaning ADG because weaning weight was determined approximately 1 wk after weaning was completed. Calves that are abruptly weaned can potentially lose weight during the first week after weaning (Sweeney et al., 2010) . Automated feeding technologies can be adopted to facilitate gradual weaning programs. For example, automated milk feeders can be used to gradually reduce milk availability over several days (de Passill\u00e9 et al., 2011) . Sweeney et al. (2010) documented that for calves fed large amounts of milk, gradually reducing milk availability over 10 d, in comparison to abrupt, 4 d, or 22 d weaning, resulted in the best combination of weaning and postweaning solid feed intakes and growth. It has also been reported that delaying the weaning of calves fed large amounts of milk from 6 to 8 wk of age (Eckert et al., 2015) , or possibly out to 10 or 12 wk of age (Meale et al., 2015) is associated with improved nutrient intake, greater growth performance, more gastrointestinal development at weaning, and fewer behavioral signs of weaning distress. Furthermore, de Passill\u00e9 and Rushen (2016) recently demonstrated performance advantages associated with the implementation of weaning strategies that rely on the calf's ability and willingness to consume starter, especially when calves are fed large amounts of milk. Further research is needed to identify best weaning practices and opportunities to maintain performance benefits of enhanced feeding into postweaning phases of production.",

            "text": "As expected, ACD calves tended to be treated for fewer preweaning disease events than RES calves. However, milk feeding treatment did not affect pre-and postweaning mortality, or postweaning disease treatment. Differences in preweaning disease treatment risk for ACD and RES calves may have resulted from improved nutrition. Khan et al. (2007a) reported that occurrence of diarrhea among enhanced-fed calves was significantly lower than that of calves reared under a restricted feeding regimen. Moreover, in a separate study, calves on a higher plane of nutrition had improved recovery from the effects of disease due to experimentally induced C. parvum infection (Ollivett et al., 2012) . Thus, free-access acidified milk replacer feeding may have positively supported preweaned calf health by allowing calves to consume more nutrients from milk. However, differences in detection and treatment of disease events may explain the treatment effect on preweaning disease, potentially reducing internal and external validity of the study results. Farm person-nel were not blind to treatment, and therefore, bias could influence recording of intensity of assessment and selection for disease treatment. Furthermore, meal feeding of RES calves likely facilitated more intense individual observation twice daily and the subsequent detection of changes in appetite and intake. Alternatively, because milk was continuously provided to ACD calves, their feeding behavior may not have been as easily observed. Reported incidence of preweaning disease was considerably lower than estimates used for sample size calculations, which were based on disease treatment information and historic calf health status data collected for this farm. Only 20% of the calves that died during the preweaning period were treated for disease before death, suggesting disease events may have been under-diagnosed. In addition, the suspected cause of death was not determined for 3 ACD and 2 RES calves. Farm files have been checked to confirm that (1) no records were found of health interventions being administered to those calves listed as dying without receiving prior treatment for disease, and (2) no cause of death was provided by farm staff members for the 3 ACD and 2 RES calves. Hence, without the support of farm records, one can only speculate that for some cases, disease went undetected and the cause of death could not always be established. Moreover, it must be noted that given the large number of hypotheses tested in the current study, there may have been potential for type I error.",
