We prospectively evaluated the usefulness of intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change in reducing VAP. Methods: A time-sequence nonrandomized intervention design was used. The study consisted of a 9-month observation phase (control group, 237 patients), a 6-month education phase, followed by a 7-month intervention phase (studied group, 227 patients). The occurrence of VAP, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality were recorded. Results: VAP occurred less frequently in the studied group (6 of 227 patients, 2.6%) than in the control group (26 of 237 patients, 11.0%; P \u03fd 0.001).",

For VAP patients, the ventilator days were 28.8 \u03ee 17.2 days and 20.2 \u03ee 4.0 days (P \u03ed 0.009), respectively, and the length of ICU stay was 27.6 \u03ee 17.0 days and 20.3 \u03ee 4.0 days (P \u03ed 0.012), respectively, in the control and studied groups. Intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change was the only independent factor responsible for a decrease of VAP in the studied group after stepwise logistic regression analysis (P \u03ed 0.003 V entilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial infection. The data from the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System indicated that VAP was the second most nosocomial infection, after urinary tract infection, affecting approximately 27% of all critical patients. 1 In Europe, VAP and low respiratory tract infection accounted for 65% of all infections in the European Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care Study. 2 With the advances of improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention, VAP remains a significant cause of mortality. 3 In addition, VAP is associated with increased morbidity and prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and hospitalization, all of which impact medical resources and finances. 4 -6 It is estimated that a single VAP episode prolongs the duration of hospital stay by 6 to 30 days or even longer, and incurs additional medical expenses ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 U.S. dollars per patient. 6, 7 Accordingly, effective prevention of VAP can be a lifesaving and cost-effective measure.",

From October 2004 to March 2005, all nursing staffs in ICU were informed why the study would be done, how the staffs would execute the intervention, and why the compliance of the intervention would be maintained high enough. Change of body position every 2 hours except for routine mouth care in the early morning was the routine nursing protocols in our ICU. The intervention was suction of oral secretions before each positional change. Other suction of oral secretions was allowed if clinically indicated. The suction of oral secretions was performed to clear the oral secretions as completely as possible and the suction tube was not extended into the oropharyngeal space. Accordingly, the patients in the studied group received additional 11 times of suction of oral secretions. The compliance of intermittent suction of oral secretions was monitored by self-report and checked randomly by senior staff during the education phase. The intervention phase of the study was started from April 2005, because the compliance of the intervention was \u03fe8/11 times in every staff. From April to October 2005, there were 227 patients who met the selection criteria were classified into studied group ( Figure 1B) .

For those with VAP, a significant decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay was found in the studied group ( Table 2 ). The duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay of VAP patients were decreased by 7 to 8 days, respectively, in the studied group. Taken together, intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change could reduce VAP occurrence and incidence and lessen the severity of VAP in ICU patients.",

The relatively low occurrence of VAP in this study may be explained in part by the following reasons. Hand hygiene and education for infection control were promoted more aggressively due to the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Taiwan in 2003. 19 Semirecumbent position with head elevation of 30\u00b0or greater, which proved useful in reducing VAP, 4,20 was part of routine care protocols in our ICU for years.

The heterogeneity of the patients as the study conducted in a combined medical and surgical ICU may confound the results or the effect of intervention. The value of intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change in reducing late-onset VAP remains unknown because late-onset VAP was not found in this study. However, the results of the present study can be clinically relevant because all patients studied came from the same ICU and were treated with same protocol except for the intervention evaluated in the studied group. This may decrease or avoid inherent bias caused by different patient population, nursing protocols, and quality of medical and nursing staffs in particular in multicenter studies or in a study conducted simultaneously in different ICUs at a same hospital. Further prospective and randomized studies with larger population are needed to verify these issues.",
