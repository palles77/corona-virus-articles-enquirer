The results showed that total REE contents in the ash samples ranged from 10.2 to 78.9 mg/kg. REEs in bottom ash were apparently higher than those in fly ash. Average REE contents in the ashes followed the sequence of Ce > La > Nd > Y > Gd > Pr > Sm > Dy > Er > Yb > Ho > Eu > Tb > Lu > Tm. Some of the elements, such as Sm, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb in the ash samples were in normal or nearly normal distribution, but Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Gd, Tb, Tm, Lu were not normally distributed, indicating some of the ash samples were enriched with these elements. Crust-normalized REE patterns indicated that two types of the MW ashes were obviously enriched with Gd and La. Sequential extraction results showed that REEs in the ash mainly presented as residual fraction, while exchangeable and carbonate fractions were relatively low. DTPA-and EDTA-extraction tests indicated that REEs in the MW ashes were generally in low bioavailability.",

However, with the growing trend of using disposal plastic or metallic goods in medical treatment, the amount of MW increased rapidly [3] .

In recent years, REEs are widely applied in medical fields such as medical reagents, laser materials, magnets manufacture, etc. Both the high levels and frequently use in medical treatment may lead to the enrichment of REEs in MW incinerator residues. In addition, Yao et al. [13] found that the concentration of REE in fly and bottom ash is several to 20 times higher than those in their raw coals, indicating REEs are concentrated in fly and bottom ash after coal combustion. Furthermore, chemical speciation of REEs may occur after combustion [12] . Therefore, it is necessary to obtain more information of REEs in this type of waste ashes so as to predict any potential risk to environment in future. In most cases, total concentration of REEs is not a good tool for potential risk assessment. Extraction procedures using a selective chemical extractant, such as strong chelating agents, could provide information on the bioavailability of REEs [14] .",

MWI-1 was a mediumscale incinerator located in north China, two mixed bottom ash samples was collected every half-month. MWI-2 was a special type of incineration facility, located in south China, which combined more than ten small fixed grate furnaces. Although air pollution control devices (APCDs) are equipped to each furnace, fly ash could hardly be collected in this type of incinerator, thus only bottom ash were obtained. Two samples were collected every half-month from this incinerator. MWI-3 was a typical small incinerator run by a hospital in a county located in middle China, which has no APCDs, thus no fly ash could be collected. Twelve mixed samples of this incinerator were collected once a week. MWI-4 was a large-scale incineration plant located middle China. This incinerator, representing more than 100 similar facilities, is equipped with APCDs. In this type of incinerator, incineration ashes are mainly collected in the bag filters as fly ash, and the residue mainly consists of unburned glasses, plastics and metallic matters, thus only fly ash samples were collected. Seven mixed samples were collected every week from this incinerator. After sampling, the samples were dried at 105 \u2022 C for 24 h and ground to <0.15 mm using an agate mortar for analysis.",

The recoveries were between 87.19 and 110.85%. of REEs in bottom ashes are 4-8 times of fly ash, which may attribute to the high boiling points of REE elements (1194-3426 \u2022 C). In addition, the input composition, combustion temperature may also contribute to the different concentration of REE in ashes between different incinerators. In case of individual REEs, Ce was the most abundant of the whole REEs, with a range of 1.60-31.52 mg/kg, followed by La (1.02-21.16 mg/kg), whereas, Tm (0-0.01 mg/kg) was the least abundant.

As can be seen, two types of MW ashes were obviously enriched with Gd (0.93 and 0.59, respectively) and La (0.60 and 0.35, respectively). Among them, Gd is widely used in medical field as an effective chelate reagent to improve NMR imaging signal, while La is used as additives to glass to make medical instruments and applied for some medical drugs.

Thus, most of the MW ashes will cause less environment problem of REE when landfill. Nevertheless, it should be noted that MWI-1 were contaminated by Gd (1.09) and MWI-2 were slightly enriched with Gd (0.70), thus Gd may accumulate in the soils when the ash is disposed by landfill. for 2.73-22.01%, while the exchangeable and carbonate fraction (0-5.89% and 0.32-4.28%, respectively) were the lowest.
