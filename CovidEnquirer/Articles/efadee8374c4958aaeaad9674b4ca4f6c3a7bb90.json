Using DAS-ELISA, the detection limit of STIV was found to be 10 3 PFU/ml. The positive rate of 15 STIV samples was 100%, while the positive rate of 100 other aquatic virus samples was 0%. These data show that DAS-ELISA is highly specific and sensitive for the detection of STIV. In clinical tests, 128 samples isolated from pond-reared turtles were subjected to DAS-ELISA and PCR. The overall agreement between the results obtained by DAS-ELISA and PCR was 98.4%. The results indicate that the DAS-ELISA method could be used for diagnosing diseases caused by STIV.",

Phylogenetic analysis based on the major caspid protein (MCP) is considered to be an appropriate method for differentiating different iridovirus strains and species (Bollinger et al., 1999) . Multiple alignment and phylogenetic trees of various STIV MCPs (major capsid proteins) show that STIV belongs to the genus Ranavirus (Zhao et al., 2007) . The complete sequence of the STIV genome has been described (Gen-Bank accession no. EU627010). The STIV genome is 105,890 bp in length and contains 105 potential open reading frames (ORFs), which encode polypeptides ranging from 40 to 1294 amino acids and 20 microRNA candidates. Comparative genomic analysis shows that STIV has a colinear arrangement of genes similar to that of frog virus 3 (FV3), which is a member of the Ranavirus (Huang et al., 2009) .",

However, the quantitation of a virus cannot be obtained by simply purifying STIV from tissue cultures or infected cells, since the purified viral proteins may contain host proteins which will not indicate the actual amount of SITV copies. As it is difficult to quantify standard samples by weight or copies in detection limit tests, the TCID 50 of virus stock solutions is measured to quantify the serial dilution. The detection limit of this ELISA was 10 3 PFU/ml. This result shows that the DAS-ELISA was sensitive to detecting very low concentrations of the STIV virus. Results from different test viruses showed that the DAS-ELISA had high specificity for STIV and had no cross-reaction with other types of virus.",

As CO cell line is not only sensitive with STIV, the results of tissue culture must be identified by other detection methods. PCR detection method is the most common method for the detection of STIV at present. In this study, the correlation rate between DAS-ELISA and PCR was 98.4%. The number of positive samples detected by DAS-ELISA was two more compared to that determined by the tissue culture and PCR method. It is possible that the STIV gene concentration was lower than the sensitivity of tissue culture or PCR, and two false negatives may have been detected. The DAS-ELISA method could also detect antigens of STIV. In other words, it could detect live viruses in samples. In contrast, PCR could only detect gene fragments. These results clearly suggest that the DAS-ELISA has high specificity and sensitivity, and produces more reliable results than PCR.",
