When information is lacking on a given species, the best model to use is typically the closest relative from which data are available. This requires knowledge of species relationships. Because of ethical concerns, humans are not commonly used for experimentation; some common and appropriate laboratory models used are other primates or the closest relatives of the primates, rabbits and rodents. However, the understanding of animal classification that most current adults have been taught in grade school is fundamentally erroneous. Many commonly used terms, such as reptile or lizard, as they are generally interpreted, can lead to misunderstanding of relationships.",

In comparative medicine, understanding what constitutes a monophyletic group is needed to understand relationships and to choose appropriate models. A group that is not monophyletic is called paraphyletic. Paraphyletic groups may not share a common ancestor or may exclude some descendants of the common ancestor. It is illogical to predict that paraphyletic groups would share characteristics that are not in nonmembers. Primates constitute a monophyletic group; when the primates except for humans are referred to, the term nonhuman primates is generally used. This qualification in the term helps the reader understand that a paraphyletic group is being referred to.",

The amniotes consist of the reptiles (including birds) and the mammals. The amnion was a major evolutionary advance, enabling the amniotes to have a completely terrestrial life cycle without the need to return to water for reproduction. This is also the first place in tetrapod evolution where common knowledge gives us fundamental errors. Herpetology is the study of nonavian reptiles and amphibians; it does not include mammals and birds. However, nonavian reptiles are far more fundamentally similar to birds and mammals than they are to amphibians, so it is not reasonable to expect nonavian reptile biology to resemble amphibian biology more closely than avian biology or mammalian biology. This is most medically apparent when looking at skin function, respiration, or reproduction.",

Within the sauropsids, the first group to diverge is the squamate (lizards and snakes)/sphenodontid (tuatara) clade. After this, the testudines (turtles) diverged, and the last two major sauropsid groups to diverge were the crocodilians and the dinosaurs, collectively known as the archosaurs. The recognition of dinosaurs as reptiles is widespread in our culture. However, what is not generally recognized is that dinosaurs are not extinct and that birds are the only surviving group of dinosaurs. This is supported both by the fossil record and by sequence data. 2 Part of this failure may be due to an erroneous picture of nonavian dinosaurs: they shared a number of traits with birds, including feathers, 3 and there is evidence they were warm blooded. 4 Nevertheless, although birds themselves constitute a monophyletic group, if birds are not considered to be part of the reptile group, then reptiles are not a monophyletic group. What we really mean by reptiles is sauropsids, and birds are a group of reptiles. The term nonavian reptile should be used if excluding birds from the reptiles, an awkward term indicating a logically awkward paraphyletic group.",

In a mammal, a persistent right aortic arch is a developmental problem that obstructs the esophagus, and the left aortic arch is the main outflow for oxygenated blood from the heart. In archosaurs, the right aortic arch is the major outflow. 5 Unlike birds, crocodilians have retained their left aortic arch, but the function it serves is primarily to transport hypercapneic blood to the stomach, where it is used to create James F.X. Wellehan, Jr. CHAPTER 3 an extraordinarily low gastric pH. 6 Indeed, crocodilians are one of the few groups of animals studied in which oral fluoroquinolones do not result in good blood levels, and it is possible that breakdown in the extremely acidic stomach may play a role in this. 7, 8 Both birds and crocodilians have four-chambered hearts. A four-chambered heart is not needed for separation of right and left blood flow, which is accomplished in nonarchosaur reptiles that lack a ventricular septum. 9 The major advantage of a ventricular septum is facilitation of pressure differentials between the left and right sides of the heart, as may be needed in an animal with a high metabolic rate. Ventricular septa evolved separately in archosaurs and mammals; both groups have warm-blooded members.",

A vertebrate host is a nutrient-rich environment. However, some nutrients may be sequestered; significant resources are spent by the host synthesizing transferrin, lactoferrin, and ferritin to make it unavailable. Many bacterial virulence pathways have evolved to access this sequestered iron. 17, 18 Homeothermic vertebrates also provide a highly temperaturecontrolled environment, whereas poikilothermic hosts require the ability to survive at different temperatures. Because of this, infectious disease manifestation may be highly temperaturedependent in poikilotherms. [19] [20] [21] This adds an extra dimension to disease ecology, especially with latent or persistent infections. Further investigation of the role of temperature in disease manifestation in poikilotherms is strongly indicated, especially with populations of many reptile species critically declining and likely to be affected by anthropogenic climate change. 22 Competition is also a major selective pressure in a vertebrate; many organisms want to live in such a nutrient-rich environment. The majority of antimicrobials are derived from molecules secreted by other microbes to compete for ecologic niches. Animal guts are some of the most diverse and rich ecosystems to be found anywhere. Many organisms that have evolved in such a competitive environment have resistance to many antimicrobials; Enterococcus sp. is a classic example.",

Many parasites tend to have slower generation times compared with viruses or bacteria, which makes rapid reproduction and moving on to a new host less of a viable strategy. The costs of parasites to their definitive hosts are relatively minimal in many cases because it is advantageous to parasites to preserve their habitat. Bullfrog tadpoles carrying the pinworm Gyrinicola batrachiensis have better feed conversion and metamorphose earlier than uninfested controls, rendering the relationship mutualistic rather than parasitic. 23 However, for parasites with indirect life cycles, causing disease in an intermediate host may be advantageous. If a rodent carrying pentastomid larvae is debilitated, it is more likely to be eaten by a snake, completing the life cycle. This may also result in greater disease in accidental hosts. 24 Some parasites do survive well in the environment; this reduces the selective pressure not to harm the host. Parasites that survive well in the environment are much more likely to cause significant disease; perhaps the best known examples of this in reptiles are Rhabdias sp., which cause pulmonary disease in squamates that may be fatal. 25 Most fungi also survive well in the environment, resulting in little selective pressure to keep their host alive. They compete significantly with bacteria for the same niches; this has resulted in the production of antibacterial compounds by fungi and antifungal agents by bacteria. The fungi are some of the closest relatives of animals; fungi, choanoflagellates, and metazoa (multicelled animals) form a clade known as the Opisthokonta. 26 An animal is much more closely related to a mushroom than it is to an oak tree. Antimicrobial drugs generally exploit differences in chemistry and metabolism between pathogen and host. Because fungi and vertebrate hosts diverged more recently, there are fewer differences to exploit, and antifungal drugs tend to have narrower therapeutic indices and use a smaller subset of mechanisms.",

Several studies have suggested that wild turtles may have a lower carriage rate for Salmonella. 33, 34 The only realistic way to reduce the risk of Salmonella in farmed turtles over the long term is to alter the ecologic niche that it inhabits. Keeping farmed animals in high population densities increases contact rates, pathogen loads, and stress, lowering barriers to transmission. Increased ease of transmission reduces the selective pressure to keep the host alive and healthy. Reducing the risk of Salmonella in hatchling turtles probably means farming at lower densities and eliminating high-density turtle farming. 35",

            "text": "Nucleic acid type is another property with a major impact on viral evolution and ecology. Large deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses often adapt to a balance with their hosts. This usually involves latency or chronic infection, with a delicate balance with the host immune system. A larger number of genes is often used to maintain this balance. Because the viruses are larger and more complicated, they require more accurate replication to avoid accumulating lethal mutations. DNA viruses usually have much more accurate replication, with either host or viral proofreading mechanisms in place. Many DNA viruses evolve at rates not much more rapid than their hosts, which enables larger viral genomes with greater numbers of genes. Large DNA viruses, especially those with intranuclear replication, are the most host-specific viruses. 38 There is evidence that some of these viruses have codiverged evolutionarily along with their hosts; this evidence is strongest in the adenoviruses and herpesviruses. In Figure 3 -3, a herpesvirus phylogenetic tree is shown. A potential root can be placed where the arrow is marked, representing an ancestral herpesvirus in an ancestral amniote. The earliest amniote divergence is between mammals and reptiles, as seen in Figure 3 -1. All known members of the Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae use mammal hosts, and the longer branch lengths in this area indicate that these viruses have diverged over a longer period of time. Heading toward the Alphaherpesvirinae, the first agents to diverge infect squamates; the squamates are the earliest divergence within the reptiles. The next group to diverge is the scutavirus, infecting turtle/tortoise hosts; this is also consistent with host divergence patterns. There are no reliable crocodilian herpesvirus sequences available for comparison. Mardivirus and Iltovirus infect avian hosts. However, the mammalian alphaherpesviruses nest within the clade infecting avian hosts. The branch lengths within the mammalian alphaherpesviruses are relatively short, which indicates that these viruses have not diverged from each other to the same extent that mammalian herpesviruses in the other subfamilies have. One plausible explanation for this is that the mammalian alphaherpesviruses represent a host jump to mammals from the Dinosauria. Chickenpox, caused by the alphaherpesvirus human herpesvirus 3, may be a descendant of a dinosaurian virus and may be more aptly named than had been realized.",

A long-lived host may provide a suitable habitat for decades. However, this balance in a definitive host may not apply to other hosts. Hosts that are similar enough for a virus to infect but dissimilar enough for the intricate balance of latency/chronicity not to work may result in overwhelming and often fatal infection. The most significant pathology associated with herpesviruses is in aberrant hosts. A well-balanced host-virus relationship may actually be beneficial to the host. Columbid herpesvirus 1, endemic in Rock Doves, causes disease in squabs kept in stressful conditions, but the overall pathologic damage is relatively minimal. However, in raptors, which prey on Rock Doves, Columbid herpesvirus 1 causes an overwhelming infection that is rapidly fatal. 39 The advantage to the pigeon populations of killing off predators likely outweighs the disadvantage of minor disease in neonates. RNA viruses reproduce less accurately. They generally lack proofreading and have the highest mutation rates of any organisms on the planet. These mutation rates mean that genetic complexity is not possible; the high error rates would render progeny requiring a large gene set nonviable. RNA viruses have small genomes and fewer genes. The advantage of such a high error rate is that RNA viruses are capable of rapidly outmaneuvering the host immune system. The strategy of RNA viruses is more likely to be rapid reproduction and moving to a new host. Because they have less complex relationships with their hosts, RNA viruses are much more capable of moving to new host species. This ability to move to new hosts reduces the selective pressure not to harm the host, and many RNA viruses are more pathogenic. A metaanalysis found that of the 20 virus families infecting the best-studied vertebrate host species, humans, four RNA virus families, Reoviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Togaviridae, accounted for more than half of emerging and reemerging viruses. 40 When one considers major viral human diseases that have recently emerged, highprofile diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Coronaviridae), West Nile (Flaviviridae), influenza (Orthomyxoviridae), Ebola (Filoviridae), and Hendra (Paramyxoviridae) are all RNA viruses.",

Approximately 1% of the typical vertebrate genome encodes for vertebrate proteins, whereas 8% to 9% of the vertebrate genome is retroviral in origin. The diversity of retroviruses in reptiles is only beginning to be understood. 41 Because of the prevalence of retroviruses in their genomes, reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that converts viral RNA back to DNA, is commonly expressed in host cells. This has also resulted in less frequent incorporation of other viruses into host genomes, especially those that replicate in the nucleus.

It is unfortunately common and considered acceptable to house snakes in breeder racks, where enclosures that are smaller in dimension than the length of the snake are stored in vertical racks in close proximity. The stress of close confinement results in elevated corticosteroids and immunosuppression . 43 The design of these breeder racks makes good biosecurity practices impossible. High population densities lower transmission barriers, reducing pressure to keep hosts alive and selecting toward virulence. 44 It is also common in the reptile trade to select for color phases. This usually involves some degree of inbreeding to select for what are often recessive traits. A major driving force for the evolution of sex is acquisition of genetic diversity for immune function. Inbreeding results in selection for greater disease. 45 Finally, reptiles are still often wild-caught, and stressed wildcaught animals are brought to large distributors who have species from all over the world in the same facility with insufficient biosecurity. This is an ideal situation for pathogen host jumps, which is where the most dramatic disease is seen. 46 Mixing of species by the exotic animal trade has already proved disastrous, with the transferral of monkeypox from Gambian Pouched Rats to Prairie Dogs to humans. 47 An orthoreovirus was first isolated in 1996 from a Mediterranean Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo graeca) in Switzerland and later characterized by sequencing. 48 This virus has more recently been associated with a high mortality rate and syncytial cell enteropathy/ hepatopathy in Leopard Geckos widely distributed in the United States. 49 This almost certainly represents a host jump at a breeding institution or distributor.",

Genetic diversity in populations needs to be valued and monitored through appropriate use of studbooks and cooperative rather than competitive interactions with breeders. Breeding for mutations needs to be discouraged. Housing needs to be entirely revised so that larger enclosures for individual animals allow feeding and cleaning to be done without cross-contamination to other animals. Importation of wild animals for sale as pets needs to be strongly discouraged. Facilities need to focus on single species and have smaller numbers of animals at lower densities.",
