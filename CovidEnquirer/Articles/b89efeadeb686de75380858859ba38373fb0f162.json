Such molecular studies (see Chapter 3) indicate that there are homologies between viral and host proteins; of particular interest to the antiviral field are those involved with genome replication and other virus enzymes. Although no host enzymes exist in eukaryotes to replicate RNA (a prerequisite for all RNA viruses) and reverse transcriptase (RT) has no corresponding host function, many viral and host genes appear to have common origins. These findings support the view that, during the coevolution of virus and host cell, there have been exchanges of functional modules, mediated by several forms of genetic recombination. Further evolution of modern viruses is continuing with mutations (substitutions, additions, deletions), recombinations, or reassortments (Holland and Domingo, 1998) .",

For example, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) have a latent state enabling the virus to survive lifelong in the host. Reactivation at intervals allows the herpesvirus to spread to new individuals, enabling transmission through space and time. In contrast, influenza virus is usually cleared from the host within days or weeks, but has the ability to spread rapidly from person to person, potentially worldwide. Only in the relatively recent past, since Jenner's first use of cowpox as a vaccine for human smallpox, have viruses faced a new threat to their replication-human intervention. Faced with vaccines and specific antiviral compounds, some viruses appear to be poorly adapted to survive. A well-known example is smallpox, which was eliminated from the human population by vaccination. Similarly, poliovirus has been eradicated from most countries of the world. The use of vaccines has greatly reduced the burden of human disease caused by several other human viruses (e.g., rubella, mumps, measles, hepatitis A [HAV] , and hepatitis B [HBV] ). Nevertheless, there seems to be no prospect of eradicating these viruses in the near future and patients with chronic HBV cannot be cured by vaccination. In complete contrast, several human viruses have, through their evolutionary history, developed survival strategies which happen to enable them to resist vaccines (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C [HCV] ). Specific antiviral compounds have been developed for several of those viral infections that have not been adequately controlled by vaccines. Examples of widely licensed compounds are given in Table 13 .2.",

We start by summarizing those evolutionary outcomes that have enabled human viruses to resist mankind's best efforts at control. The review then focuses on how viruses acquire resistance to compounds that specifically target a virus protein (e.g., polymerase, . For the therapy of chronic viral infections, such as HIV, the concept of the genetic barrier has emerged as key factor for delaying antiviral resistance. In some cases, the price to the virus of gaining resistance may be reduced \"fitness.\" There may, however, be other less obvious effects. Conceptually, one way to avoid virus resistance is to use a compound to target a host protein rather than a viral protein. Such an approach seems to risk causing unacceptable toxicity, although recently it has been shown that there can be specificity for the virus-infected cell. We end by asking the question, how will viruses respond to such an indirect challenge?",

Most potential mutations will give a nonfunctional enzyme and a nonviable or \"less fit\" virus. There may be very few (even a single) specific mutation(s) that interfere with the binding of the antiviral compound to the enzyme yet does not reduce by too much the catalytic activity. Such mutations, which usually appear first, are therefore termed \"primary mutations.\" Initially, the degree of resistance may be modest and so there is pressure to create additional \"secondary mutations,\" which enhance the level of resistance to the drug. These structural changes often result in reduced catalytic activity and probably will affect the fitness of the virus (the term \"fitness\" embraces not only the viability or replication rate of the virus but may also include effectiveness of immune evasion genes, transmission, etc.). So yet further mutations may appear which are apparently unrelated to the protein sites that interact with the drug. Such \"tertiary mutations\" may have no direct effect on biochemical drug\u00c0protein binding but may increase enzyme efficiency so as to compensate for the deleterious effects of the primary and secondary mutations. Many compensating mutations are suspected but often their precise role has yet to be elucidated. Of course, virus mutations do not always fit tidily into these human concepts. There may be a \"step\" mutation which then allows further mutations. In the case of HIV protease, both the protease and the corresponding cleavage sites can co-mutate to give cross-resistance to PIs (section 13.6.3).",

(2006) investigated the mutations giving resistance to HPMPC and if the drug resistance was inextricably linked to reduced virulence. If this were the case, then there would be no reason for malicious introduction of mutations conferring resistance. Drug-resistant vaccinia virus (VV) was obtained by serial passage of the virus in cell cultures with increasing concentrations of HPMPC. In parallel, wt virus was passaged in drug-free cultures. From the final passage, seven plaque-purified HPMPC-resistant (HPMPC R ) isolates and five plaque-purified wt isolates were obtained. As it was thought that resistance to HPMPC would be due to mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene (E9L), this gene was sequenced for each of these isolates. The results are summarized in Table 13 .4.",

Therefore it seemed likely that only two point mutations, A314T and A684V, were potentially associated with resistance. These are within the 3 0 \u00c05 0 exonuclease proofreading domain and the polymerase catalytic domain, respectively. Marker rescue methods were used to investigate the role of each of these in drug resistance. The cloned DNA encoded A314T, A684V, or both A314T and A684V mutants. As a control, wt DNA was included to test for any of the polymorphisms having an effect on drug resistance. The results showed that A314T and A684V contributed to resistance but both together gave the greater resistance (about 10-fold) to HPMPC.

Indeed, large-scale screening of isolates of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 obtained from typical lesions of labial or genital herpes show no obvious trends to resistance (,1%) after extensive use over the period from the early 1980s to date (Bacon et al., 2003) . However, resistance to nucleoside analogs does appear to be more common in patients with neonatal HSV and herpes keratitis. In the former, resistance may be observed in 5% of patients and for ocular isolates from herpes keratitis, Duan et al. (2008) reported that 11/173 (6.4%) patients yielded resistant isolates and 10/11 of these isolates mapped to TK, with these authors arguing that the cornea represents an immunologically privileged site. In immunocompromised patients, resistance to ACV and similar drugs has commonly been reported in about 5% of patients and in some cases up to 20%. Often, such viruses comprise mixtures of wild-type together with one or more different resistant mutants. There may be two reasons underlying the apparent divergence between results in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Most important, many resistance mutations clearly result in loss of virus \"fitness.\" This is most easily demonstrated for TK-defective strains in a variety of animal models. Such strains are much less neuropathogenic (Field and Wildy, 1978) and, while they can establish a latent infection, these seem unable to reactivate efficiently to produce infectious virus (see 13.8.3). Also, other resistance mutations undoubtedly result in subtle defects that may diminish the ability of the virus to reactivate efficiently from latency and/or replicate successfully. Secondly, the establishment of neuronal latency with wt virions during primary infection means that subsequent reactivations originate from the pool of sensitive virus.",

These primary mutations generally reduce the activity of the compounds by only 2-to 5-fold, not enough to be clinically resistant but sufficient to confer a selective advantage to the virus. These variants will overtake the wt HIV and allow other mutations to develop. For indinavir and ritonavir, the first mutation is V82A/T/F/S, for nelfinavir, D30N. For other PIs, especially saquinavir, the first mutation is often L90M (Clavel and Hance, 2004) .

There have been several reports of NA-inhibitor resistance among clinical isolates. For example, a study in Japan found that 9 of 50 children with influenza A (H3N2) virus infection who had been treated with oseltamivir had a virus with drug resistance, although it was suggested that these mutations were less fit than the wt viruses from which they were derived (Kiso et al., 2004) . One study followed resistance from 1996 through (Tashiro et al., 2009 . During the period 1996\u00c02002, influenza A N2 viruses were circulating but no resistant viruses were detected (0/175). During the season 2003\u00c02004, 0.3% (3/1180) of N2 samples were resistant. During the following three seasons, no N2 resistant viruses were detected but N1 virus started circulating. In 2004\u00c02005 and 2006\u00c02007, no resistant viruses were detected but in 2005\u00c02006, 3% (4/132) were found. This survey confirms that resistance to oseltamivir occurs in the normal population far less readily than does resistance to amantadine. Unfortunately, the situation changed dramatically and globally within 3 years (Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010) . Among seasonal H 1 N 1 influenza, the proportions of oseltamivir-resistant viruses were low (ca. 1%) in 2006\u00c02007 but then resistance emerged rapidly worldwide; in the United States, high-level resistance (100-to 3,000-fold) was found in about 20% of samples tested in 2007\u00c02008 and about 90% in 2008\u00c02009. Sequencing confirmed the H275Y mutation in resistant strains. It appears that a natural, spontaneously arising variant had spread globally, without drug selection pressure, during 2007\u00c02008. Early work in cell culture and animals suggested that the H275Y mutant virus was somewhat disabled, but there seems to have been co-selection of other compensating mutations, perhaps to the hemagglutin gene (HA), to give a \"fit\" virus enabling this variant to spread globally.",

With N1, just a single mutation, H275Y, gives high-level resistance but the corresponding mutation in N2, H274Y, does not give resistance. Instead two mutations, E119V and R292K, give high-level resistance with N2.",

However, aside from this factor, it is as easy to form resistant mutants, one in the RT and one in the protease, as for the monotherapies. It is more effective to combine two or three compounds that target the same HIV enzyme. An ideal situation is when the resistance mutations to one drug confer enhanced sensitivity to the other.

The virus envelope glycosylation is required for the proper folding of the gp120, for efficient entry of the virus into target cells, and for hiding the potentially highly immunogenic protein surface of gp 120. Dendritic cells have a receptor, DC-SIGN, which captures HIV via the (high-mannose) glycans and then directs transmission of HIV to T-lymphocytes. The expression of gp120 in the cell membrane of virus-infected cells allows fusion with uninfected cells, resulting in giant multinucleated cells. Carbohydratebinding agent (CBA) have the potential to inhibit all these steps. As proof of concept, several plant lectins, with binding preference to mannose-containing glycans, have been shown to inhibit all the above steps. More encouraging for drug potential, Pradimicin A (PRMA) is a non-peptidic, small molecular weight CBA.

The mutations are predominantly in gp120, notably not in gp41, and result in loss of glycosylation sites, mainly the high-mannose glycan sites. There is a high genetic barrier due to the possibility that many PRMA molecules can bind to each single gp120 molecule and there has to be multiple glycan deletions for significant phenotypic resistance. When in the presence of an immune system, it is hoped that these CBA-resistant strains of HIV will be rendered susceptible to neutralizing antibody due to the exposure of the gp120 protein surface which is normally hidden under a protective glycan cover. There is now some evidence for this. Hu et al. (2007) used cyanovirin-N (CV-N) , a CBA, to generate strains of HIV resistant to CV-N and other CBAs so that they could investigate the impact of the immune system on these CBA-resistant strains. One of the isolated resistant clones, GCV4, had five mutations resulting in the loss of glycosylation at amino acid residues 289, 332, 339, 392, and 448, all these being in the constant regions C2, C3, and C4 of gp 120. When used to infect cells with control serum, wt and GCV4 infectivities were not changed by the concentration of the serum. In contrast, when serum from HIV 1ve patient was used, the serum had a greater potency against GCV4 than wt HIV. Furthermore, GCV4 was more sensitive to monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed to the V3 loop of gp120, a major determinant of viral entry. There was about an 8-fold higher sensitivity to MAb 1101 and over 200-fold for MAb 447-52D. As controls, there were no changes in sensitivities to MAbs directed at other parts of gp120. Furthermore, when wt and mutant SIV (lacking several gp120 glycans) were compared in monkeys; the wt gave long-lasting viremia (about 7 log 10 ) whereas the mutant virus gave a short period of high virus levels which dropped as antibody levels rose.",

For example, TSG101 is a host protein which is part of the system regulating transport within the cell. Importantly, TSG101 is normally found only in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells, but an influenza viral protein binds to TSG101, and this results in TSG101 being localized to the cell membrane. Using TSG101-specific antibodies, it was shown that at time of infection with influenza virus, there was no TSG101 on the surface of the cell but by 24 hours after infection, TSG101 was on the surface. This was confirmed with different cells and various strains of influenza. Furthermore, TSG101 monoclonal antibodies reduced the release of influenza virus from infected cells, indicating that TSG101 plays a vital role in the replication cycle of influenza virus.

To think that the blocking of TSG101 would permanently inhibit virus replication is both overly optimistic and unwise. The virus may mutate to increase its binding to the host protein so that it outcompetes the inhibitor. Alternatively, it is possible that there is a secondary mechanism for the release of virions from the cell. The efficiency of such a secondary mechanism could be enhanced by mutations, the new virus variant then becoming dominant.",

            "text": "The origins and evolution of viruses may be shrouded in mystery but one current aspect is certain. Only in the relatively recent past, since Jenner's first use of cowpox as a vaccine for human smallpox, have viruses faced a new threat to their replication-mankind's intervention. Through the course of evolution, viruses have developed many hugely varying strategies for their highly successful survival. Now faced with this new threat posed by vaccines and specific antiviral compounds, some viruses are poorly adapted to survive. The human smallpox virus has been eliminated from the human population. The global polio eradication initiative has been highly successful. Its aim, to eradicate polio worldwide, seems achievable but remains elusive. The use of vaccines has been successful in preventing many viral infections, including rubella, mumps, measles, HAV and HBV. However, there seems to be no prospect of eliminating these viruses in the near future. More recently, specific antiviral compounds have been developed to control those human viruses for which, generally, no effective vaccines are available. ACV, active against herpesviruses (HSV-1 and -2, VZV), was the first truly active and selective antiviral agent. Some three decades later, it is still being used but has been joined by just two other drugs, the prodrug of ACV, VACV, and FCV. Although these drugs can limit the symptoms of acute infection, the incidence of latent infection has not been reduced. The mainstay for therapy and prevention of HCMV is just one drug, valganciclovir (VGCV). The spread of HIV has prompted a huge search for effective drugs and combinations of three or four drugs are providing at least several years of clinical control. From this research, drugs against HBV were developed. As for HIV, a similar combination approach is being developed for HCV. The very high mutation rates for HIV and HCV, combined with their high replication rates (10 9 and 10 12 virions/day, respectively, in an infected patient without therapy), means that the threat of breakthrough remains ever-present especially if drug doses are missed. The concept of genetic barrier has been helpful in guiding combination therapies to give effective control of patient symptoms for at least several years. Although HIV has spread across the world and caused so much human disease in just a few decades, perhaps the virus with most potential to cause a rapid pandemic is influenza virus. The 2009\u00c02010 pandemic, caused by H 1 N 1 strain of influenza is the first influenza pandemic that may have been constrained by the use of antiviral drugs and the rapid development of a vaccine.",

            "text": "The last three decades have seen many advances but also highlighted the limitations of mankind's attempts to control viruses. Truly active and safe antiviral compounds seemed rather a remote possibility until ACV was discovered. Even then, when HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS, a vaccine approach was seen as the preferable way forward with an effective vaccine expected in 2 years. Instead, it has been remarkable how combination pills have given HIV patients an easy-to-use, once-daily dosing regimen, which is well tolerated. In too many publications, the Introductions state that virus resistance is limiting the use current antiviral compounds, and therefore new compounds with a different virus target and new mode of action are required. Even better to delay resistance, look for compounds which raise the genetic barrier. So far, the best combinations have been with compounds that target the virus polymerase. Similar combinations with protease inhibitors have not been so successful because the protease and the virus polypeptide cleavage sites can co-mutate, an option not available to the virus polymerase. Although the genetic barrier needs to be increased for long-term delay in resistance in chronic infections, with any drug combination used in naturally self-limiting infections, the extra effect in reducing viral load quickly may well be a useful benefit.",
