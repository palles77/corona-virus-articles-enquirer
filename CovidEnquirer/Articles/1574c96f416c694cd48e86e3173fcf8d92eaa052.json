It remains unclear as to why proper hand hygiene practices cannot be sustained and what role health literacy plays in older adults fight against infectious diseases. Methods: A convenience sample of 433 old adults aged 65 and above was recruited. Their hygiene practices and health literacy were evaluated using a structured questionnaire adopted from the Centre for Health Protection and the Chinese version of the HLS-Asia-Q questionnaire. Results: The percentage distribution of the hand hygiene performance, from always to never, was 18%-10%. A majority 63.28% (274) of them were classified as having inadequate health literacy (0-25), while a meager 1.62% (7) of them as having excellent health literacy (42.01-50). The Spearman correlation showed a significant positive relationship (P < 0.05) between the participants' health literacy and their hand hygiene practices. Conclusions: Health literacy and hand hygiene are positively related in helping the older adults fight against infectious diseases. To sustain proper hand hygiene practices is to provide frequent hand hygiene training to the older adults.",

As experienced in Hong Kong in 2003, the public awareness of the importance of handwashing had a sudden and significant surge while the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was being contained. At the time, a survey showed 93% of the subjects perceived handwashing as an effective hygiene measure to protect themselves. 1 Another survey with similar results held 2 years later in 2005 by the Centre for Health Protection showed 71.7% of the 3,220 subjects still agreed that keeping hands clean and washing hands properly were effective means to prevent infections through direct contacts. However, this public awareness has not been fostered. This is evidenced in a hygiene survey, carried out by the Public Opinion Program of the University of Hong Kong (HKUPOP) in 2013, which found that 65% of the subjects admitted that they had eased off in hand hygiene protection. 2 Since older adults are usually living in old districts or crowded homes with a poor environment, they are more vulnerable to epidemics and infectious diseases. So, there is an urgent need to study the reasons for the drop, if any, in the awareness and practices of proper hand hygiene of older adults.",

Old people are more likely than others to contract them with mortality rates higher than 50%. Seasonal influenza-related diseases, more common but not as widely reported, are also highly infectious, particularly for those aged 65 or older living in overcrowded homes with limited service facilities. From past statistics, about 70%-90% of the seasonal influenza-related deaths were from people of this age group and roughly 50%-70% of seasonal influenzarelated hospitalizations also came from these older adults. 4 In some critical cases, improper or inadequate hand hygiene technique or forgetting, especially for the older adults, to wash hands had led to death and complications. 5 Further supporting evidence is shown by another survey which found that the effect of age could affect hand hygiene and younger people were noted to show higher hand hygiene awareness. 6 What role does health literacy play in performing proper hand hygiene? As reported in literature, an adequate level of health literacy is needed to make an appropriate health decision. 7 Public health agencies believed there was a relationship between health literacy and hygiene in children. 8 In a meta-analysis, previous findings suggest that only limited knowledge existed about the effects of hand hygiene education on multiple illness outcomes. 9 Obviously, it is appropriate to undertake an exploratory study on this topic, especially when the older adults in Hong Kong were not targeted in these studies.",

However, there is still an absence of health literacy studies in relation to hand hygiene preventable illnesses accounting for grave clinical, social, and economic burdens. 11 Although in McGuckin, et al's 2011 study 12 health literacy was stated as one of the components of patient empowerment in relation to hand hygiene promotion, the study findings did not use age as a variable.

With physical impairments such as hearing and vision loss, one may also suffer from a decreased ability to process health information correctly in a timely manner. Hence, declining cognitive ability and increasing physical impairments will have negative effects on their health literacy. The above weaknesses are evident in our findings shown in Table 1 . The above is also consistent with our findings in Table 2 , in which a majority (63.28%) of the participants had an inadequate level of health literacy and a sizable group (22.17%) had a problematic level of health literacy. In view of the above observations, it is advisable to strengthen the health literacy of the older adults so as to better protect them against infectious diseases.",

On the other hand, those with higher education and income are inclined to consult more external independent sources such as health professionals, the internet, and newspapers. Our findings that most of the participants had little or no primary education may have been a key contributing factor to the high percentage of low health literate participants in this study (85.45%). They knew what to do for proper hand hygiene but did not consistently practice it and had difficulty in understanding health information sufficiently to make informed decisions due to low health literacy. Under these circumstances, the participants were unable to clearly identify or handle certain health information confidently, causing them to have difficulties in interpreting, judging, and evaluating health-related information. This observation is in sync with that of another study which explained that there was a lack of proper health information and that old adults were unaware of the types of vaccination recommended to them. 15 This calls for simplified and standardized health information which could more effectively improve old people's health literacy. From our findings in Table 1 , the participants' hand hygiene awareness (62% with improper hand hygiene practices) after the 2003 SARS outbreak was unsatisfactory. These findings are consistent with Manning 2011's study 14 which showed that the regular use of hand sanitizer remained significantly lower than during the flu pandemic in 2009. During SARS, hand hygiene practices could be attributed to people's raised awareness by the ubiquitous promotion of proper hand hygiene techniques in handling communicable diseases through various media in Hong Kong during that period. Ever since SARS, the Hong Kong Government has stepped up territory-wide health education and promotion to maintain proper hand hygiene practices among health care workers and the general public, for example, education materials like banners and DVDs on hand hygiene have been delivered to the public, private hospitals, and clinics. 16 However, the awareness seems to have tapered off. More than 50% of the participants did not carry out proper hand hygiene practices, thus rendering them more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Proper hand hygiene has been shown to significantly reduce the spread of common cold and flu, especially in the older adults. As shown in Q6 of Table 1 , 63% of the participants were unsatisfactory in using liquid soap to wash their hands. This means the participants had lower protection against infectious diseases; as shown in previous studies nonantibacterial soap combined with hand-hygiene education could have the strongest protective effect against gastrointestinal illnesses. 9 So, it is necessary to encourage old adults to form the habits of using soap to wash hands to safeguard themselves against such illnesses. One plausible suggestion from these findings is that the government can initiate and support frequent proper hand hygiene training for the older adults as a short-term measure against infectious diseases, especially at the homes for the aged.",

On the other hand, if the questions contained complicated messages involving decision making, second opinion seeking, or mental health related, the participants would regard the questions as relatively difficult. This observation has a health policy implication in the enhancement of the older adults' health literacy. Instead of investing huge sums of money to improve their health literacy, it is more worthwhile and cost effective to invest in simplifying and standardizing health information to enhance old adults' comprehension. This observation was similar to the results of Stevens's study, 17 which pointed out that a good understanding of the learning capacity of old adults has direct, practical implications for professionals trying to educate old people about health care services and benefits. Another study also suggested that the health literacy of old adults will greatly improve if familiar examples built on individuals' previous life experiences are used. 18 Besides, using video or audio (rather than textual) health information can also enhance our older adults' heath literacy since most of our participants came from the lower income group and had no formal or only primary education.",

The effect, however, was only short term and has not sustained.

Indeed, the initial rapid spread of SARS in Hong Kong in 2003 was due to people's improper hand hygiene practices and their low-health literacy.
