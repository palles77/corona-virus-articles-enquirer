In this study, we carried out detailed phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparisons based on 74 complete nucleotide sequences of the IBV S1 gene, including strain I0636/16 and 73 representative sequences from each genotype and lineage. The results showed that strain I0636/16 represented a novel genotype, designated as lineage 1 within genotype VII (GVII-1). Further comparative genomic analysis revealed at least two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in a lineage 18 within genotype I (GI-18)-like virus with an asyet-unidentified sequence, likely derived from another IBV strain, resulting a novel serotype with a lower affinity to the respiratory tract in chickens. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first evidence for recombination leading to replacement of the complete spike gene and the emergence of a novel genotype/serotype with a lower affinity to the respiratory tract in chickens comparing to one of its parental virus ck/CH/LGX/ 111119. These results emphasize the importance of limiting exposure to novel IBVs that may serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses, as well as the importance of IBV surveillance in chicken flocks.",

It is a highly contagious viral respiratory disease that is considered as one of the most important causes of heavy economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . All IBV strains replicate primarily in the respiratory tract and cause respiratory diseases in birds. However, some virus strains are also able to replicate in many other epithelial surfaces, including kidneys and oviducts, and infection with these strains may thus result in nephritis, decreased egg production and quality, and significant mortality. Numerous different IBV strains have been reported to date, with pathologies ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to severe kidney and oviduct diseases (Cavanagh, 2007) .",

            "text": "IBV is an avian coronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA genome of approximately 27 kb. The 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes four structural proteins, including spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and four non-structural accessory proteins, 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b. The 5\u2032 end of the genome encodes two polyproteins (1a and 1ab) that contain proteins necessary for RNA replication (Boursnell et al., 1987) . Similar to other coronaviruses, genetic diversity in IBV is created by both recombination events (Kottier et al., 1995) and by mutations, including substitutions, deletions, and insertions (Shi et al., 2000) , that occur during replication of the viral genome. The high mutation rates are attributed to the limit of replication fidelity although it has been shown that coronaviruses possess proofreading enzyme (3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease) which is essential for replication fidelity (Denison et al., 2011) , while recombination events are thought to result from a unique templateswitching copy-choice mechanism during RNA replication (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011) .",

A new classification based on analysis of the whole S1 gene has recently been proposed (Valastro et al., 2016) , including grouping and naming 32 lineages, comprising six genotypes (GI-1-GI-27, GII-GVI), and a number of inter-lineage recombinants. Some of these lineages are distributed in several continents, countries, or regions, such as GI-1 (formerly Massachusetts; Mass), 4/91, or CR88) , , GI-16 (ck/CH/LDL/97I (LDL/97I) or Q1), GI-21 (Italy 02), and GI-23 (Var2) (de Wit et al., 2011; Valastro et al., 2016) , while others are geographically confined to specific regions.",

In addition, IBV variants of indigenous lineages were also found to be circulating in chicken flocks in China. New lineages, GI-7 , GI-28, and GI-29 (Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017) , were recently found in chickens suffering from respiratory and urinary health problems. These results indicated that novel IBV lineages have been emerging continuously in China in recent years. An epidemiological study conducted in China from January 2016 to December 2017 based on the S1 gene sequence isolated and characterized a new variant, designated I0636/ 16, in Guangxi province in 2016 (Xu et al., 2018) . Despite the fact that most heterogeneity of IBVs occurs in the S1 gene, sequence analysis of this gene alone was not sufficient to characterize this novel strain. We therefore carried out a detailed investigation of the S1 gene and the complete genomic sequence of the I0636/16 strain to clarify its genetic characteristics and gain further insights into the origin of the strain. We also investigated the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the IBV strain I0636/16 in the present study.",

Viral stock was prepared by inoculating each of the viruses into 9-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs by the allantoic cavity route, followed by incubation for 48-72 h and chilling at 4\u00b0C overnight. Allantoic fluid was harvested from the inoculated eggs and clarified by low-speed centrifugation at 1500 \u00d7 g for 10 min. Cleared supernatant was stored in aliquots of 0.3 ml at \u221270\u00b0C until further processing. Virus titration was performed using 9-day-old SPF chicken eggs, as described previously (Liu et al., 2009 ). The eggs were examined for IBV lesions including curling and dwarfing up to 7 days post-inoculation. Viral titers were calculated according to Reed and Muench (1938) and expressed as the 50% egg infective dose per milliliter (EID 50 /ml).",

Strain I0636/ 16 was grouped together with all the IBV strains used in this study, which had been isolated from different regions at various times but was grouped apart from coronaviruses isolated from other avian species (Fig. 1B) . Within IBV strains, I0636/16 showed close relationships with IBV strains LGX/111119 (93.5%), CK/CH/GD/GZ14 (93.1%), I0114/14 (92.8%), CK/CH/2010/JT-1 (92.8%), GX-YL9 (92.4%), and GX-YL5 (92.1%), most of which were isolated from South China, particularly from Guangxi province. We investigated the impact of probable recombination events on the origin of strain I0636/16 by conducting an analysis using SimPlot software ( Fig. 2A) . Two major recombination events were observed, one in the 3\u2032 end of Gene 1 (at approximately nucleotide 20,265) and another in the 5\u2032 end of Gene 3 (at approximately nucleotide 24,152). The phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2B ) clearly supported the SimPlot results, with strain I0636/16 showing identities of > 96.6% with LGX/111119, CK/CH/GD/GZ14, I0114/14, CK/CH/2010/JT-1, GX-YL9, and GX-YL5 for the genomic region 1-20,265, compared with an identity of < 86.9% with the Mass-type strains. Similar to this genomic region, I0636/16 showed an identity of 92.5% with LGX/111119 for the genomic region 24,152-27,640, compared with < 85.2% with the Mass-type strains. These results suggested that the LGX/111119 (GI-28 lineage) virus, circulating in chicken flocks in China , was a potential parent of recombinant I0636/16. In contrast, in the second phylogenetic tree, the branch (genomic region 20,266-24,151) that included the spike gene separated the strain I0636/16 from all reference strain sequences, and shared no more than 75% nucleotide identity with any of the reference strains, making difficult to assess the origin of the fragment 24,152-27,629. BLASTn analysis using this fragment of I0623/16 showed that this strain was closely related to strain GX-NN130021 (97% nucleotide identity), but shared no more than 75% nucleotide identity with any other IBV strain in the GenBank database.",

In the present study, we used the complete S1 gene for IBV typing, as suggested previously (Manswr et al., 2018; Valastro et al., 2016) , and found no evidence of recombination events in the I0636/16 S1 gene sequence. We did identify a novel genotype consisted by IBV isolate I0636/1 and the reference strain GX-NN130021, which clustered together in the phylogeny and did not fall within established lineages. In agreement with this result, the two strains shared high nucleotide and amino acid identities (97% and 96.9%), compared with low identities with representative IBV strains from different lineages. Based on these results, these two IBV strains should be grouped into a novel genotype, designated as GVII-1, although the designation of lineage/genotypes should be assigned to monophyletic groups of at least three viruses sampled from at least two different outbreaks (Valastro et al., 2016) . Generally, it is considered that the chance of having the same serotype is higher between strains with the same genotype (Wang and Huang, 2000) , though these data showed that this relationship was not very strong, given that a change in a small percentage of the amino acids in the S1 protein could result in a change of serotype (Cavanagh et al., 1992) . The current virus cross-neutralization results showed that GVII-1 was not only a novel genotype, but also antigenically different from the currently tested genotype lineages. Strain GX-NN130021 was isolated in Guangxi province, China, in 2013 , suggesting that the novel GVII-1 had been circulating in China over a 5-year period. However, the source of this new virus introduction into the chicken population in China remains unknown.",

            "text": "Full-length genome analysis showed that the emergence of the I0636/16 strain involved a double crossover event that replaced the spike gene by that from an as-yet-unidentified IBV strain. However, the remaining parts of the genome originated from commonly known GI-28 IBV strains, suggesting that the I0636/16 strain was a mosaic, and that one of its putative parents was descended from GI-28 lineage viruses. The antigenic differences among IBV strains have been investigated, and previous work showed that S1 sequences had a stronger correlation with protective relatedness than with antigenic relatedness between strains (Ladman et al., 2006) . The as-yet-unidentified parental virus of strain I0636/16, which shared the same spike gene with strain I0636/ T. Ma, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 230 (2019) 178-186 16, might thus be antigenically different from vaccine strains used in China, such as H120 and 4/91; therefore vaccination with these live vaccines might not offer complete protection against infection with the parental virus of strain I0636/16. Similarly, considering the high prevalence of the GI-28 lineage in south China where the novel GVII-1 viruses were isolated, it is reasonable to speculate that the GI-28 lineage may co-infect birds more frequently than other lineages, although the current commonly used vaccines cannot offer complete protection against GI-28 viruses . Vaccination with these vaccines is therefore likely to induce non-sterilizing immunity, which may allow prolonged replication, shedding, and circulation of both the deduced parental strains of GVII-1 viruses. Consequently, although vaccination with attenuated vaccines is carried out intensively in China, this procedure may produce an environment where co-infection with GI-28 and the as-yet-unidentified parental viruses can enhance the likelihood of recombination. Theoretically, the short persistence and shedding, and limited numbers of I0636/16-like viruses isolated so far in China suggest that the probability of recombination between the as-yet-unidentified parental virus and GI-28 viruses may not be high, similar to the hypothesis suggesting that the shorter persistence and shedding of Mass-based vaccines (Bijlenga et al., 2004) and the low percentage of M41-like viruses (Chen et al., 2015; Moreno et al., 2017) LGX/111119 Fig. 4 .

            "text": "T. Ma, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 230 (2019) 178-186 The IBV genome undergoes mutations and recombination, and the exchange of a long region of the genome by recombination may allow viruses to rapidly explore ample areas of the sequence space, potentially leading to the emergence of novel strains with different features in terms of virulence and disease pathogenesis, antigenicity, and cell and tissue tropisms (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Kant et al., 1992; Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011) . The genome of strain I0636/06 was closely related to GI-28 viruses, except in the spike gene. This phenomenon was similar to that of TCoV, the genome of which was also closely related to IBV, except in the spike gene. Replacement of the spike gene of TCoV was responsible for the host shift from chickens to turkeys and a pathogenicity shift from upper-respiratory disease to enteric disease (Jackwood et al., 2010) . Even though the recombination events that replaced the spike gene did not result in a tissue tropism shift in the kidneys of chickens after challenge, the I0636/16 strain showed low affinity to the respiratory tract compared with the parental virus LGX/ 111119 . In contrast, the ability of I0636/16 to reach the cecal tonsils and subsequently to replicate in this tissue was slightly higher compared with that of respiratory tract. The replicase gene of avian coronavirus IBVs is known to be a determinant of pathogenicity (Armesto et al., 2009) , and we were therefore unable to compare the pathogenicity of I0636/16 with one of its deduced parental virus until a source has been identified for the replicase gene because it is as-yetunidentified, though another deduced parental virus (LGX/111119) showed more severe pathogenicity than I0636/16 in SPF chickens. However, we cannot conclude that this difference in pathogenicity was due to replacement of the spike gene until the source of the GVII-1 spike gene has been identified, and alternate explanations for the observed differences between I0636/16 and GI-28 spike should be considered.",

The recombinant I0636/16 was only detected sporadically and persisted for a short time, and thus probably represented strains that were not sufficiently competitive with respect to one of their progenitor strains, LGX/111119-like viruses . However, compared with the unidentified parental virus, I0636/ 16-like strains may be sufficiently competitive, and the parental virus may have been circulating at below cut-off levels for detection, due to its lower replicative capacity and lower percentage.",

The number of passages of the virus in eggs was high (six passages), and the possibility that some genetic changes were introduced as a result of its propagation in the eggs cannot be ruled out. No complete genomic sequences of GVII-1 lineage viruses are currently available in the public database. The present results thus provide valuable information on the characteristics of the I0636/16 strain and contribute to a better understanding of the origin of GVII-1 viruses. Further studies on these isolates will provide information on the emergence, evolution, and effectiveness of current vaccines against these isolates.",
