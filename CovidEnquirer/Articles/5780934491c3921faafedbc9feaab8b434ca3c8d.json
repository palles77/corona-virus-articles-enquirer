With a crude mortality of 9%, its cause was quickly identified as a novel coronavirus that jumped species from animals to man. The SARS coronavirus epidemic, which began in the Fall of 2002, was related to the exotic food industry in southern China, initially involving disproportionate numbers of animal handlers, chefs, and caterers. Subsequently, person-to-person transmission spawned the outbreak. What distinguished this illness clinically was the fact that approximately half of the victims were health care workers (8), infected while caring for recognized or unrecognized patients with SARS. There are many curiosities and uncertainties surrounding the epidemic of SARS with lessons that may be useful to the community of infectious diseases physicians, especially when looking ahead to the next epidemic. Herein we relate our perspectives on useful lessons derived from a review of the SARS epidemic. \u0106 2005 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Diarrhea and dyspnea were common among populations studied with SARS (11), but each was not highly predictive of infection in any single patient with the novel coronavirus. Thus, the high transmissibility to nurses and physicians and the higher than expected mortality were key features strongly suggesting a new pathogen. Furthermore, SARS to many clinicians appeared to have a biphasic course, with cough and fever initially followed in 3-5 days with a normal temperature and increasing hypoxia. The point is that physicians and nurses need to be trained to be alert to the unusual, the unexpected, and the variant clinical presentation. The astute, frontline health care worker is the first defense against spread of an emerging pathogen.",

This is neither new nor unique, and in the future other nations will be similarly concerned about financial losses should they acknowledge an outbreak in their country. Thus, the question is, how can incentives be designed to encourage early and transparent reporting ? We would suggest that the World Bank offer financial support to countries that agree to early reporting with full disclosure about new epidemics. It is likely that the global economy would be better preserved with such a positive financial incentive. Consider the fact that estimates of the cost of SARS ranged from $30 billion to $100 billion (13) . A fraction of that cost could have been invested in China late in the Fall of 2002 to help limit the spread of SARS within Guangdong providence, where it originated. At least in retrospect this would seem to indicate a great return on investment.",

It probably should not be tied to financial penalties, however, because government officials and not the general citizenry would make the decision to obscure the truth. For example, one could consider the banning of the country from participating in the subsequent Olympics, a situation that would cause national shame for the country's political leadership. Alternatively, the offending country might not be allowed to cast votes in the United Nations for a 1-year period. Of course, there are no guarantees that either the favorable financial incentives or an international rebuke would always lead to early reporting, but the ideas are testable.",

The fact is that the boundaries between foreign or exotic and what is traditionally referred to as domestic or local have blurred. We in the developed world cannot afford to be disengaged or appear to show indifference to the health challenge of less fortunate populations living in remote sectors of the world. The noted ethicist Peter Singer argues that given the advances in transportation and communication, coupled with the emergence of transnational companies and universal problems, we must transcend national boundaries to embrace a new ethic of one world (16) .

Alternatively, the students may be in a panic way and plans for managing their exposures and concerns need to be formally addressed and managed. We suggest that institutions recognize the fear and uncertainty among health care workers when a new epidemic hits. Creating telephone hot lines with trained professionals would seem to be an important first step. Thereafter, a Psychological Support Response Team should be formed to outline appropriate procedures to manage the stresses expected and to define specific goals of intervention and therapy. Trained counselors who can explore the origins of individual fears need to be on the team and supported by infectious disease experts who can discuss the facts related to the disease, its incubation period, the risk of transmission and outcomes. Because we will continue to see new epidemics, hospitals might consider developing guidelines now that could be utilized in future introductions of new pathogens.",

Furthermore, a nurse who cared for one of the victims also developed SARS. These contacts represent secondary transmissions of the novel coronavirus. Four contacts of the nurse became ill with SARS, thus representing tertiary transmission of the infection. Herein is the lesson: laboratory-associated cases will occur after epidemics of new pathogens, and assiduous procedures for managing all stored laboratory specimens are essential to avoid such infections. Additionally, secondary and tertiary transmissions can occur and lead to death in some instances. All laboratories with the new pathogen should review their protocols for strict adherence to procedures that will preclude transmission to those handling such agents.

The SARS coronavirus, which has a crown-like appearance when seen through the electron microscope (36) , became an accidental tourist, leaping from animals to nearby people-exotic animal handlers, chefs, and caterers initially. Epidemiologists had suspected this early because these same occupations among people in southern China were five-times over-represented compared to controls (37) . Subsequently, microbiological confirmation came after an almost identical virus was isolated from the civit cat, a member of the mongoose family considered to be a culinary delicacy in the Guandong Province. Other exotic animals were also found to harbor the virus, and healthy animal handlers were shown to have a high prevalence of antibodies to the SARS coronavirus. However, the most important animal source of the epidemic that sparked the initial human infections remains uncertain. Thereafter, person-to-person spread occurred from patients to health care workers and both family members and other contacts. Almost 8500 people in 30 countries were infected, and 9% of the victims died.",

Probably not, yet with the annual visits of influenza and its 36,000 deaths in the U.S., the continuing threat of bioterror, the arrival of monkeypox in the U.S., and recent experience with SARS, which may return, large hospitals need to provide a geographically clustered area with an additional 10 or more rooms with negative air pressure (negative to the hallway) so that a variety of respiratory pathogens can be contained to the patients' rooms. Such steps would go a long way to create a new era of preparedness, not focused only on the latest pathogen. 2) There can be no excuse for health care workers who fail to wash hands between patients. Unfortunately, the current compliance rates in U.S. critical care units are only 40-60%. Better rates of hand washing need to be realized. Hand-washing rates should become an issue for the annual evaluation of health care workers and a necessary component for continued employment. 3) There are a limited number of occasions when the hospital environment needs to be disinfected and not just cleaned. It is recognized that transmission of most infections in the hospital is not from the environment. Nevertheless, we pay insufficient attention to this aspect of infection control when we are beset with specific problems. In all ongoing challenges with multi-antibiotic resistant, hospital-acquired infections (now common in the U.S.), antibiotic-associated diarrheal infections, and now SARS, we have several unique situations in which it is useful to decontaminate the hard surfaces that are commonly touched, such as bedside tables, door knobs, and IV poles. 4) To avoid needlestick injuries and the spread of bloodborne infections, we need to champion the available technology of non-sharp devices such as retractable needles after blood draws. If these technologies are affordable and effectively used, they will have the benefit of reducing in-hospital transmission of hepatitis C, HIV infection, and others-possibly including SARS.",
