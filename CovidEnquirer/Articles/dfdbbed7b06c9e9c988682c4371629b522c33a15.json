An alkyl or aryl substituent was also introduced at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold and expected to introduce additional interactions with the protease. Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation were employed to construct the octahydroisochromene scaffold. The introductions of the P1 site His-al and the substituent at 1-position was achieved using successive reductive amination reactions. Our initial evaluations of the diastereo-isomeric mixtures (16a-d) revealed that the octahydroisochromene moiety functions as a core hydrophobic scaffold for the S2 pocket of the protease and the substituent at the 1-position may form additional interactions with the protease. The inhibitory activities of the diastereoisomerically-pure inhibitors (3a-d) strongly suggest that a specific stereo-isomer of the octahydroisochromene scaffold, (1S, 3S) 3b, directs the P1 site imidazole, the warhead aldehyde, and substituent at the 1-position of the fused ring to their appropriate pockets in the protease.",

Two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa), are coded in the genome as precursor proteins to yield functional proteins.

The distance between the 2-position carbon atom of the cyclohexyl-ring and \u03b1-nitrogen atom of cyclohexylalanine (Cha) was 3.48 \u00c5 (Fig. 1 ). This result suggested that the cyclohexyl ring may be connected to the peptide chain via a methylene linker, yielding a new inhibitor scaffold containing a hydrophobic decahydroisoquinoline ring.

Monoprotection of diol 8 using tert-butyl diphenylsilyl chloride (TBDPSCl) followed by oxidation of the unprotected alcohol in the resulting product via a Ley-Griffith oxidation reaction using tetrapropyl ammonium perruthenate (TPAP) gave the corresponding aldehyde. The product was used with any purification, and reacted with (methoxymethyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride to give 9. The methoxyvinyl group in 9 was then converted to the corresponding aldehyde upon treatment with 10-camphorsulfonic acid. The isolated aldehyde was reacted with methyl triphenylphosphonium chloride to yield a terminal olefin. The TBDPS group in the product was then removed upon treatment with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to give 10. The primary alcohol in 10 was oxidized via a Ley-Griffith oxidation reaction and the resulting aldehyde homologated using a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction upon reaction with ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acetate to give 11. The ethyl ester in 11 was reduced with diisobutyl aluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) and the resulting allylic alcohol stereo-specifically oxidized via a Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in the presence of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and (S, S)-diethyltartrate ((-)-DET) to yield 12 as a single diastereomer. The terminal olefin in 12 was then oxidized via a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using potassium osmate (VI) dehydrate (K 2 OsO 2 (OH) 4 ) and potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 ) in the presence of hydroquinine (anthraquinone-1,4-diyl) diether ((DHQ) 2 AQN). The formation of the expected diol was confirmed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy with the simultaneous production of a small amount of the cyclized product (13) formed via the nucleophilic addition of the resulting alcohol. Thus, the mixture was treated with p-toluenesulfonic acid without any further purification to convert the remaining dihydroxylated product into the desired cyclized product (13) . However, whether product 13 was formed as a single diasteroisomer or an inseparable mixture of diastereomers could not be determined using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Thus, the product was converted into the final products containing different substituents at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold to evaluate whether the fused ring structure would function as a novel inhibitor scaffold. Conversion of key intermediate 13 into the final product was carried out according to the route shown in Scheme 3. The terminal 1,2-diol in 13 was oxidatively cleaved using sodium periodate and the resulting aldehyde subjected to a reductive amination reaction with four different amines in the presence of NaBH 3 CN. Each aminated product was then methylated with paraformaldehyde to give 14a-d. The primary alcohol in each product was oxidized using N-tert-butylbenzensulfenamide/1-chloropyrrolidine-2,5-dione (NCS) and the resulting aldehydes were reductively condensed with H-His-N(OMe)Me to give their corresponding Weinreb amides (15a-d). 15 Each product was finally reduced to their corresponding aldehyde upon treatment with DIBAL-H and purified by LC/MS to give the desired aldehyde product (16a-d), which exhibited a broad single peak in LC.",

Since it was unclear whether key intermediate 13 used for the above syntheses was formed as a single diastereomer or an inseparable mixture of diastereoisomers using 1 H NMR spectroscopy, the 13 C NMR spectrum of 13 was examined and two signals were detected for the methine carbon atom neighboring an oxygen atom in the octahydroisochromene scaffold ( Fig. S-1 ). This result strongly suggests that triol 13 obtained using the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using (DHQ) 2 AQN as a ligand was formed as a 1.5:1 diastereoisomeric mixture (Scheme 2 and entry 1 in Table 2 ). Thus, the reaction conditions used in the asymmetric dihydroxylation were evaluated focusing on the chiral ligand, a key factor in the stereo-selectivity of the reaction. 16 Precursor 12 was treated with K 2 OsO 2 (OH) 4 and K 3 Fe(CN) 6 with or without the chiral ligand as stated above (Scheme 2) and the products immediately converted into triol 13 upon treatment with p-toluenesulfonic acid. The diastereoisomeric ratio of the products was estimated using the methine carbon atom signal in the 13 C NMR spectrum. Table 2 shows that in the absence of the chiral ligand, an equal amount of both the possible diastereomers was obtained (entry 4). A slight preference for one diastereomer was observed when hydroquinine (anthraquinone-1,4-diyl) diether ((DHQ) 2 AQN) was used as the chiral ligand, as in Scheme 2 (Table 2, entry 1). In contrast, a much better preference for one diastereoisomer was observed when 1,4-bis(dihydroquinine)phthalazine ((DHQ) 2 PHAL) or hydroquinidine-2,5-diphenyl-4,6-pyrimidinediyl diether ((DHQ) 2 Pyr) was used as the chiral ligand. (DHQ) 2 Pyr (entry 3) showed a slightly better diastereoisomeric ratio (dr = 7:1) than (DHQ) 2 PHAL (entry 2, dr = 6:1), which made it technically feasible to isolate the major product. As expected, the diastereoisomeric ratio was inverted when hydroquinidine-2,5-diphenyl-4,6-pyrimidinediyl diether ((DHQD) 2 Pyr) was used as the chiral ligand (entry 5, dr = 1:15).",

In the 1 H NMR spectrum of the major product, a nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) was observed between the protons at the 1and 3-positions of the octahydroisochromene ring and between the protons at the 3-positon and bridgehead \u03b1-position, which indicates that these protons adopt a cis-\u03b1-configuration ( Fig. S-1a) . The coupling constant between the proton at the 1-position and the neighboring proton of the secondary alcohol was observed to be 9.7 Hz, which also indicates the cis-configuration of the protons. Taken together, it was estimated that the configuration of the major product was (1-S, 3-R) 13a, as shown in Table 1 . 17 Although the confirmed structure of 13a was the opposite to that expected for the asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction, it has been occasionally reported depending on the substrate used. 18, 19 In this specific substrate, steric hindrance due to the epoxy alcohol interferes with the ordinary interactions with the chiral ligand to direct attack of potassium osmate to the terminal olefin from the less sterically hindered face ( Fig. S-1c ).",

The allylic alcohol obtained from the reduction of ester 11 was oxidized via a Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction using (-)-DET as the chiral ligand to give 12 as a single diastereoisomer. The terminal olefin in 12 was then oxidized via a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction using (DHQ) 2 Pyr as the chiral ligand to give 13a as the major product (dr = 7:1). The mixture was then used for the following reactions without separating the major product. Oxidative cleavage of the 1,2-diol in 13a and the subsequent reductive amination reaction using n-butyl amine and paraformaldehyde were conducted as described for compound 14a (Scheme 3). The final coupling with H-His-N(OMe)Me followed by reduction with DIBAL-H was carried out as described for compound 16a (Scheme 3) to yield 3a as the major product. Since the diasteroisomeric ratio of the major product was relatively high (dr = 7:1), purification of the desired 3a could be achieved using LC/MS without difficulty. A diastereoisomer 3b with the configuration of (1-S, 3-S) was synthesized by employing a combination of (-)-DET and (DHQD) 2 Pyr, which were used in the Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction (yielding a single diastereoisomer) Scheme 3.

Similarly, the construction for the configuration of (1-R, 3-S) in 13d was performed using a combination of (+)-DET and (DHQD) 2 Pyr, which were utilized in the Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation reaction (yielding a single diastereoisomer) and the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction (dr > 29:1), respectively. In both syntheses, the diastereo-excess (dr) was exceedingly high, which led to both the products, 13c and 13d, being obtained as single diastereoisomers.

The IC 50 value of 16a was estimated from the sigmoidal plot obtained from the decrease in the digested substrate ( Fig. S-2) . However, the as-obtained IC 50 value (Table 1 ) was an approximate value and only indicated the inhibition tendency because the obtained plot was not well fitted to the expected sigmoidal curve due to the presence of only 40% of the desired diastereomer (derived from the diastereoisomeric mixture of 13, dr = 1.5:1). Compound 16b and 16d showed 50% inhibition at 400 \u03bcM and 16d showed weak inhibition even at 1600 \u03bcM. In spite of these vague results, they strongly suggest that the octahydroisochromene ring functions as a novel hydrophobic scaffold in the SARS 3CL pro inhibitor. It was also expected that a medium size linear alkyl group at the 1-position, such as n-butyl in 16a, can interact with SARS 3CL pro at a specific site, but bulkier substituents such as the branched group in 16c or planar groups in 16b and 16d exhibit less interactions.",

The docking scores obtained for inhibitors 3a, 3b, and 3d were similar (3a, -8.3615 kcal/mol; 3b, -8.3982 kcal/mol; 3d, -8.4354 kcal/mol), whereas the docking score for 3c was rather low (-7.9265 kcal/mol). The docking mode for 3b (IC 50 = 95 \u03bcM) showed nearly the same interactions with the protease as the parent decahydroisoquinoline inhibitor at its P1 site imidazole as well as those at the P2 site fused-ring system (Fig. 3a) . The warhead aldehyde was also directed toward the active center of the protease, as-observed in the case of the decahydroisoquinolin inhibitor (Fig. 3a ). In addition, the nbutyl substituent at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold in 3b was assumed to be situated on the surface of the protease near the S1\u2032 to S2\u2032 pockets (Fig. 3b) . In contrast, the docking mode for less potent inhibitor 3c (IC 50 = 780 \u03bcM) showed different interactions at the P1 site imidazole and aldehyde warhead at the active center of the protease, although the interactions with the fused-ring system were expected to be similar to 3b (Fig. 3c ). The interactions with the n-butyl substituent at the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold in 3c were different from those of inhibitor 3b. The different modes of interaction observed for 3b and 3c were derived from the change in the configuration of the octahydroisochromene scaffold, which caused an 88% decrease in the inhibitory activity. To confirm the estimated interactions, X-ray crystallographic analysis of 3b complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro is now underway in our laboratory.",

Alkyl and aryl substituents were also introduced to the 1-position of the octahydroisochromene scaffold to form additional interactions with the protease. Sharpless-Katsuki asymmetric epoxidation and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction were used to construct the four possible diastereoisomers of the octahydroisochromene scaffold by selecting the appropriate chiral ligand in each asymmetric reaction. The purity and stereochemistry of the synthesized key intermediate 13 were confirmed using 1 H NMR, NOE, and 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Introductions of the P1 site His-al and substituent at the 1-position was achieved using successive reductive amination reactions.",

            "text": "Inhibitor 16a was prepared as a diastereo-isomeric mixture derived from the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction and showed moderate inhibitory activity toward R188I SARS 3CL pro . In contrast, the diastereoisomeric mixtures of 16b, 16c and 16d, which contain bulky or planar substituents at the 1-position, showed lower inhibitory activity. These results strongly suggested the functionality of the octahydroisochromene as a core hydrophobic scaffold for the S2 pocket of the protease and the additional interactions formed between the 1-position of the scaffold when the substituent is a linear alkyl group of moderate size. Based on these positive findings, the effects of the stereochemistry of the octahydroisochromene scaffold were examined and the results suggest that a specific configuration of the octahydroisochromene, (1S, 3S) 3b, directed the P1 site imidazole and the warhead aldehyde to their counterpart pockets in the protease. In addition, the n-butyl substituent at 1-position of the fused-ring system in 3b was also expected to form some interactions with the protease. In contrast, these functional groups in the enantiomeric octahydroisochromene inhibitor, (1R, 3R) 3c, were probably misdirected causing an 88% decrease in the inhibitory activity. Thus, detailed analysis of these interactions based on X-ray crystal analysis of 3b complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro to optimize the substituent at the 1position as well as an alternative warhead group are ongoing in our laboratory.

After stirring for 20 min, the mixture was cooled to 0\u00b0C and 12 (3.06 g, 15.6 mmol) in t-BuOH/H 2 O (1:1, 20 mL) added, and the resulting mixture stirred for 10 h. The reaction was quenched with aqueous Na 2 SO 3 and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CHCl 3 /MeOH = 20:1) to give the triol as a colorless oil, which was used immediately in the next step without any further purification. To a solution of p-toluensulfonic acid monohydrate (836 mg, 4.40 mmol) was added the triol in CH 2 Cl 2 (50 mL) at room temperature and the resulting mixture stirred for 10 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CHCl 3 /MeOH = 20:1) to give 13a ( 3 CN in aqueous 0.1% TFA (10-20% over 30 min) as the eluent and the cleavage rates were calculated from the reduction in the substrate peak area. Each IC 50 value was obtained from the sigmoidal dose-response curve (Fig. S-2 for a typical sigmoidal curve). Each experiment was repeated in triplicate and the results reported as the average value.",
