The objective of this study was to determine if feeding beef cows Seenriched alfalfa hay during the last trimester of gestation improves passive transfer of ovalbumin (OVA), a surrogate protein marker for IgG absorption. Control cows (n = 15) were fed non-Se-fortified alfalfa hay (5.3 mg Se/head daily) plus a mineral supplement containing inorganic Se (3 mg Se/head daily). Med-Se (n = 15) and High-Se cows (n = 15) were fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay (27.6 and 57.5 mg Se/head daily, respectively); both groups received mineral supplement without added Se. Calves were randomly assigned to receive orally administered OVA at 12, 24, or 36 h of age. Calves that received their oral dose of OVA at 12 h of age had higher serum OVA concentrations across the first 48 h of life if born to High-Se cows compared to calves born to Control cows (P = 0.05), with intermediate values for calves born to Med-Se cows. Our results, using OVA as a model for passive transfer, suggest that if calves do not receive adequate colostrum to reach maximum pinocytosis, then supranutritional Se supplementation in beef cattle may improve passive transfer in their calves, if calves receive colostrum within the first 12 h of age.",

Calves that fail to suckle adequately possess low concentrations of Ig in their serum. Therefore, intestinal absorption of a sufficient amount of Ig is a key factor in neonatal health and survival. Passive immunity provided by maternal Ig protects neonates from enteric disease, diarrhea, and respiratory disease for several weeks after birth [1] . If failure of passive transfer occurs, calves are predisposed to infection, sepsis, and death [2, 3] .",

Epithelial cells of the small intestine absorb colostral IgG1 via pinocytosis. Proteins pass through enterocytes in vacuoles and are released via exocytosis into lacteals [2, 3] . From the lacteals, colostral proteins enter the systemic circulation, which allows newborn calves to receive maternal IgG1 by passive transfer [2, 3] . Closure of the intestine to absorption is defined as cessation of absorption of macromolecules from gut to blood in neonates [9] . It is thought that the process of closure occurs in a retrograde manner, in that the basal cell membrane ceases to release the vacuolated proteins, transport ceases, and then uptake by the pinocytosis tubular system ceases [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Peak serum IgG1 concentrations are normally reached 32 h postpartum [8] . After absorption ceases, serum concentrations of passively acquired IgG1 begin to decline through normal catabolic processes [15] . We have previously shown that supplementing dairy cows with supranutritional Se-yeast during the dry period, or spiking colostrum with Na-selenite, improved IgG status in their calves [16] ; Kamada et al. [17] showed similar results with spiking colostrum with Na-selenite. The underlying mechanism for improved passive transfer is unknown. Selenium has been postulated to act directly on intestinal epithelial cells to activate pinocytosis [17] . Another hypothesis is that supranutritional concentrations of Se delay enterocyte replacement by a more mature population of intestinal epithelial cells, which have been shown to be incapable of passive transfer [18, 19] .",

            "text": "Based on our previous findings in dairy cows, the objective of this study was to determine if feeding Se-replete beef cows Se-enriched alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay during the last trimester of gestation delays turnover and replacement of fetal intestinal epithelial cells in their calves, thus extending the period of time during which large proteins can be transferred from intestinal lumen to neonatal blood. We previously reported that feeding Se-biofortified hay to these pregnant beef cows improved Se status in cows and their offspring, as well as the IgG1 concentrations in colostrum compared to cows receiving control hay [20] . In this paper, to test the hypothesis that passive transfer is enhanced in calves born to cows fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay in the last trimester of pregnancy compared to calves born to Control cows fed the USDA-approved upper limit of Na-selenite in salt [21] , we administered 25 g oral ovalbumin (OVA) to calves at 12, 24, or 36 h after birth, and measured serum OVA concentrations to estimate the time of gut closure. We chose OVA with 44,300 Da molecular weight (MW) as a surrogate protein for IgG (the bovine IgG molecule is approximately 150,000 Da MW) because human albumin with 68,000 Da MW and human IgG with 163,000 Da MW have been previously shown to be absorbed equally in relation to total dose in calves [10] . If passive transfer was prolonged by enhanced Se intake in dams, we expected OVA concentrations in serum of newborn calves to be higher at all dosing time points compared to Control calves.",

For outcome variables (except for colostrum), repeated measures over time were collected in calves. For OVA measurements, we additionally accounted for time of OVA administration. We tested for homogeneity of variance among treatments and for normal distribution of residuals. The effects of agronomic Se fortification on colostral Se and IgG1 concentrations were measured using PROC GLM. Fixed effects in the models were Se application rate (Control, Med-Se, High-Se), calf gender, and age group of cow (2-3 years, > 3 years). For repeated measures within animals (calf WB-Se concentrations, serum IgG1 concentrations, serum OVA concentrations), we modeled repeated measurements within animals using an unstructured variance-covariance structure. The unstructured variance-covariance matrix provided the most parsimonious matrix based on the lowest value by the Aikaike Information Criterion. Fixed effects in the models were Se application rate (Control, Med-Se, High-Se), blood sampling time, and the interaction of blood sampling time and Se application rate.

Once taken up by pinocytosis, macromolecules are repackaged by the Golgi apparatus and transferred across the basal membrane of the cell into the lymphatic system. Movement of macromolecules out of gut epithelial cells in neonatal calves continues after pinocytosis stops, consistent with the observation that maximum concentration of serum IgG1 occurs after gut closure [2, 3] . After fetal epithelial cells are replaced with cells of the adult phenotype, all of the processes associated with absorption of large molecules cease. From our data, it is not possible to determine which of these processes in passive transfer is affected by Se supplementation of dams. Our results are consistent with either or both increased pinocytosis and a delay in turnover of fetal epithelial cells in calves born to High-Se dams.",

This is reflected by the increase in whole blood Se concentrations in Control cows from151 \u00b1 4 ng/mL (mean \u00b1 SEM) at baseline to 193 \u00b1 14 ng/mL at parturition [20] .

            "text": "In summary, we have demonstrated that calves born to High-Se dams and fed OVA at 12 h of age had higher serum OVA concentrations at 24 and 36 h of age compared to Control calves. This suggests that supranutritional Se supplementation of dams can improve passive transfer by increasing the amount of protein transferred. It is possible that neonatal small intestinal development can be affected by maternal Se nutrition in cattle during the third trimester of gestation, thereby altering passive transfer capacity in newborn calves. Enhancing the Se status of the neonatal calf can be achieved by feeding the dam Se-biofortified alfalfa hay during the last 8 weeks of pregnancy. In addition, feeding Se-fortified alfalfa hay to the pregnant beef cow increases IgG1 concentrations in colostrum. Based on these results from OVA administration, we suggest that early feeding (\u2264 12 h of age) will also increase IgG1 concentrations in calves from High-Se dams receiving similar volumes/concentrations of IgG1 colostrum compared to Control calves.",

Calves born to High-Se dams that had OVA administered at 12 h of age attained on average serum OVA concentrations of 8.1 mg/dL. Similar values were measured at 36 h of age, with decreasing serum OVA concentrations (to 4.3 mg/dL) observed in this group at 48 h of age. As shown inFig. 1B, all calves that received their oral dose of OVA at 24 h of age had on average OVA serum concentrations of 3.6 mg/dL at 36 h regardless of Se status at birth (P = 0.78), and all concentrations decreased significantly by 48 h (P < 0.001) with no Se treatment by time interactions (P = 0.46).As shown inFig. 1C, all calves that received their oral dose of OVA at 36 h of age had similar serum OVA concentrations at 48 h of age, which were close to the detection limit in most calves (13 out of 15 calves had OVA serum concentrations < 1 mg/dL).
