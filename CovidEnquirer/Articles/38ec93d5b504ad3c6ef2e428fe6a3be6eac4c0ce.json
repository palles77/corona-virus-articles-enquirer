The initial visit sets the tone of the immediate and future relationship with the patient and begins the process of diagnosing and managing the illness; it is a dynamic encounter, with each of the patient's responses stimulating further probing and forming of diagnostic hypotheses. The physician must be attentive to the patient's story, piecing together each bit of evidence to form a tentative preliminary diagnosis and differential diagnoses. Nothing should escape the eyes and ears of a watchful diagnostician. History taking is more than information gathering: it affords the opportunity to decipher the patient's body language as the inquiry proceeds. At this stage, no symptom or circumstance should be disregarded. With an understanding of biology and medicine coupled with past experience, the physician tries to connect the salient parts of the patient's story to develop a plausible explanation of the physiologic or pathologic events that lead to illness.",

            "text": "Although striving for a single diagnosis, the physician should realize that more than one disease may be present and that rare diseases are diagnosed only by those who consider them. Nevertheless, the maxim \"uncommon presentations of common diseases are more frequent than common presentations of uncommon diseases\" is likely to be true. It is important to continue both to gather information and to be open to reforming the diagnostic hypothesis as more information becomes available. Premature judgment or the failure to continue considering reasonable alternatives after an initial diagnosis is made is the single most common diagnostic error. 1, 2 In the field of decision science, these failures are postulated to arise from \"cognitive dispositions to respond\" and include several of the biases in judgment or reasoning defined in Table 16 -1. 3 It is hypothesized that a greater awareness of these prejudices among clinicians may facilitate \"cognitive debiasing,\" thereby reducing the frequency of these common errors of reasoning. 4 An alternative or potential complementary approach is to use decision-support software to expand the differential diagnosis and avoid overlooking unusual or severe conditions. 5 Bayes theorem implies that diagnostic tests will have a higher yield if the prior probability of the diagnosis is high (also called pretest probability). Specific details from the history raise the probability of different diagnoses and direct further tests in a productive manner. Further diagnostic investigations-imaging, blood tests, pulmonary function studies, and even parts of the physical examination-depend on the history. Historical clues raise or lower probabilities, thereby improving the value of subsequent questions and evaluations. Test results plus findings from the history and physical examination may confirm or refute the main and differential diagnoses, setting up either a management plan or the need for an alternative hypothesis.",

            "text": "Clinical Features. Most episodes of coughing are associated with short-lived upper respiratory tract infections or allergies, and patients, recognizing this, seldom visit their physicians for this type of cough. Nevertheless, cough is the most common complaint for which patients seek medical attention and the second most common reason for having a general medical examination. 31 Physicians should realize that when patients seek their help for cough, it is often out of concern for something new, different, and alarming about the symptom. The essential first step in evaluating a patient with cough is to obtain a thorough history, paying particular attention to the following aspects: acute or chronic, productive or nonproductive, character, time relationships, type and quantity of sputum, and associated features. It is noteworthy that, of the various components of the workup used by the authors of a systematic anatomic investigation to determine the causes of chronic cough, the medical history alone led to the correct diagnosis in 70% of patients. 31 Acute coughing is frequently associated with nasopharyngitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, or other, usually virusinduced, upper respiratory tract infections. Less commonly, it may be the chief manifestation heralding the onset of viral or bacterial bronchopulmonary infection or the inhalation of allergenic or irritating substances. The causes of cough that persisted for 3 weeks or longer in 102 patients were postnasal drip (41%), asthma (24%), gastroesophageal reflux (21%), chronic bronchitis (5%), and bronchiectasis (4%). 31 Other important though less common conditions include eosinophilic bronchitis 32 and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 33 In 1999 the importance of the \"big three\"-postnasal drip, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux-was verified by the results of another survey of the causes of chronic cough. 34 Not everyone agrees, however, and some experts claim that emphasis on the top three conditions is unwarranted and moreover that it stifles interest and research into other important causes and mechanisms of chronic cough. 35 knowledge is lacking for dyspnea, although evidence is mounting that links the symptom with pain. 21, 22 Studies of the neurophysiology of dyspnea are further complicated by the lack of objective tools to quantify a subjective sensation with interindividual variation. Rating instruments-such as the Borg scale 23 and questionnaires, such as the British Medical Research Council questionnaire 24 and Pulmonary Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire 25 -have been validated as useful in measuring dyspnea. Selfadministered, computerized versions of the Transitional Dyspnea Index and Multidimensional Baseline Dyspnea Index appear to be at least as good as interview questioning for this assessment. 26 Progress, though, is being made: recent studies have clearly shown that dyspnea during exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is closely linked to dynamic lung hyperinflation. 27 Clinical Features. Patients with respiratory, cardiac, hematologic, metabolic, and neuromuscular disorders may all complain of dyspnea. A careful and detailed history is necessary to uncover the cause of the sensation. In addition, it is important to document the impact of the symptom on the patient's daily activities and to be alert to the \"decreased activity phenomenon.\" The latter describes patients who say their dyspnea has not worsened, but only because they now walk more slowly or no longer climb stairs or engage in athletic activities. Sometimes this slowing down is so gradual, patients may be unaware or attribute it to aging. Assessing the activity required to bring about the dyspnea is important. How many stairs can be climbed before stopping? How far can someone walk on level ground at her or his own pace without stopping? Does talking on the phone, getting dressed, or eating cause dyspnea? Is the patient short of breath at rest?",

Orthopnea, the onset or worsening of dyspnea on assuming the supine position, like paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, is found in patients with heart disease and chronic lung disease. Measurement of amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide has proved useful in differentiating between a cardiac and a respiratory origin in patients with dyspnea. 28 The inability to assume the supine position (instant orthopnea) is characteristic of paralysis of both leaves of the diaphragm. Dyspnea soon after assuming the supine blood may follow a prolonged coughing episode. Patients may swallow or aspirate blood from the upper airway. Some patients report only that the blood \"welled up\" in their throats. Others will say that it is mixed with sputum. Hematemesis can usually be differentiated from hemoptysis by the presence of symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement, such as nausea and vomiting, a history of peptic ulcer disease, alcoholism, or signs of cirrhosis; when in doubt, esophagoscopy is indicated.",

Pleurisy, or acute inflammation of the pleural surfaces, has several distinctive features. Pleuritic pain is usually localized and unilateral-and tends to be distributed along the intercostal nerve zones. Pain from diaphragmatic pleurisy is often referred to the ipsilateral shoulder and side of the neck. The most striking and defining characteristic of pleuritic pain is its clear relationship to respiratory movements. The pain may be variously described as \"sharp,\" \"burning,\" or simply \"a catch,\" but it is typically worsened by taking a deep breath, and coughing or sneezing causes intense distress. Patients with pleurisy frequently also experience dyspnea because the aggravation of their pain during inspiration makes them conscious of every breath.",

Patients with exaggerated cough responses or habitual cough may have a \"psychogenic\" component; therefore, even when chronic cough has a pulmonary cause, it may respond to behavioral modification. 37 Most physicians have heard the ancient diagnostic axiom, which is still true, that any change in the character or pattern of a chronic cough in a smoker demands a prompt chest radiographic evaluation for lung cancer. Less well known is that cough may be the sole presenting manifestation of asthma 38 or gastroesophageal reflux disease. 39 In low-income countries, where the majority of the global population lives, cough, usually productive but not always, of 3 weeks or longer has been the traditional (and reliable) clinical marker of possible pulmonary tuberculosis that should trigger examination of sputum specimens for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Revised recommendations by tuberculosis experts now include cough of \"2 or 3 weeks,\" or longer, as an indication for sputum examination. 40 Among the many complications of persistent or recurrent cough are tussive syncope; retinal vessel rupture; persistent headache; chest wall and abdominal muscle strains, including the development of abdominal wall hernia 41 ; and even rib fractures.

A neuritic origin may be suggested by the presence of lancinating or electric shock-like sensations unrelated to movements, and hyperalgesia or anesthesia over the distribution of the affected intercostal nerve provides confirmatory evidence. In many instances of new-onset, neuritic chest wall pain, the diagnosis becomes clear a day or two later when the typical vesicular rash of herpes zoster appears. 49 Among the most important types of chest pain is myocardial ischemia, which is usually caused by coronary artery atherosclerosis. These attacks, which are provoked by inadequate oxygen delivery to the myocardium, span a continuum of severity from chronic stable angina to classic acute myocardial infarction. Typical anginal pain is induced by exercise, heavy meals, and emotional upsets; the pain is usually described as a substernal \"pressure,\" \"constriction,\" or \"squeezing\" that, when intense, may radiate to the neck or down the ulnar aspect of one or both arms. 50 Pain from variant or Prinzmetal angina is similar in location and quality to typical anginal pain but is experienced intermittently at rest rather than during exertion. 51 Both typical and variant types of angina are relieved by coronary vasodilator drugs, such as nitroglycerin. Typical angina also decreases with rest or removal of the inciting stress.",

For example, the percussion note over a large pneumothorax is hyperresonant and becomes tympanitic when tension is present; in contrast, percussion over a pleural effusion or pneumonia produces dullness, which has been defined as a low-intensity sound of short duration, feeble carrying power, and rather high pitch. 66 Flatness is the unresonating sound obtained by percussing over the liver. Three different tonal zones can thus be detected when percussing large pleural effusions: normal resonance above the fluid, dullness in the middle, and flatness when completely below the fluid; these variations in sound may result from the presence of an internal meniscus or fluid wedge, which points upward into the lung above it.

Indeed, there is now a body of literature on computer-assisted mapping of breath sounds using both recording and imaging techniques which provides new insights into their origin and they are heard also attenuates or interrupts transmission of normal lung sounds. Accordingly, normal breath sounds are diminished or absent over a pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and peripheral bullae, or distal to an obstructing mass lesion.

There is general agreement that the brief recurrent detonations that characterize fine crackles are caused by the explosive openings of small airways that had closed owing to the surface forces within them. 79, 84 This explains why fine crackles are much more common during inspiration than during expiration and why they are best heard over dependent lung regions-where airways are more likely to close-than over uppermost regions. This is also compatible with the presence of crackles in healthy elderly persons in whom dependent airways close at resting lung volumes. Crackles therefore are best heard during the first deep breaths at the lung bases posteriorly. After several such breaths or intentional coughing, these fine crackles will disappear if the small airways remain open throughout the time the patient is being examined. 84 The timing of crackles is also important. Nath and Capel 85 have shown that late-inspiratory crackles are more often found in restrictive than obstructive lung disease. In a study by P\u00fcril\u00e4 and colleagues, 86 the crackles of pulmonary fibrosis began at 45% of inspiration, whereas those of nonfibrotic lung conditions were heard earlier: COPD at 25%, bronchiectasis at 33%, and heart failure at 37% of inspiration. 86 This suggests that more tension is required to open individual airways in fibrosis than in lungs with secretions or edema. As inspiration progresses, radial traction on airway walls increase until suddenly they pop open. 85 Thus crackles heard later in inspiratory time imply that the tension required to open individual airways is greater. Coughing or deep inspiration may change the quality of coarse crackles, such as those associated with underlying alveolar or airway disease, but the crackles rarely disappear entirely. Expiratory crackles are much less frequent than inspiratory crackles and are often seen in obstructive lung disease. 83 ",

When the lung parenchyma is consolidated and the airway leading to the involved region is patent, breath sounds are well transmitted to the chest wall and are termed bronchial breath sounds (Audio 16-2). Bronchial breath sounds are loud, high-pitched, tubular, or whistling sounds with expiration as loud as or louder than with inspiration. Bronchial breath sounds are similar to tracheal breath sounds (Audio 16-3), and their presence is the classic auscultatory sign of pneumonia with consolidation. Similar sounds are heard in patients with other types of consolidation, such as pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. The presence of this sign assumes that the sounds originate centrally and reach the chest wall. 82 Interposition of a sound barrier between the central airways where sounds originate and the chest wall where thickened and roughened by an inflammatory or neoplastic process, easy motion is prevented and a pleural friction rub may be produced. These sounds vary in intensity but often have a leathery or creaking quality that may be exaggerated by pressure with the stethoscope (Audio 16-11 ). Typically rubs are heard during both inspiration and expiration, but they are evanescent and variable and may be heard in only one part of the respiratory cycle. Surprisingly, rubs may still be heard in the presence of a large pleural effusion, which prevents the coarsened pleural surfaces from actually rubbing against each other.",

Wheezes are usually louder than the underlying breath sounds and frequently noted by patients. A leading theory is that wheezes are produced by fluttering of the airway walls and fluid together induced by a critical flow velocity. 87 The pitch of the wheeze is dependent on the mass and elasticity of the airway walls and the flow velocity. The degree of bronchial obstruction is proportional to the amount of the respiratory cycle that it occupies. There is no relationship to the intensity or pitch of the wheeze and pulmonary function. Wheezes are well heard over the trachea, and listening over the trachea may be superior to listening over the lung in most asthmatic patients 87 (Audio . Wheezing with forced expiration can sometimes be provoked in healthy subjects 79 and does not establish a diagnosis of asthma. More helpful is to elicit wheezing and/or coughing at a full expiration without forced effort.

Ordinarily the patient is asked to say in a quiet voice \"one, two, one, two,\" \"ninety-nine, ninety-nine,\" or \"E, E.\" If enhanced responses are heard, the patient repeats the words while whispering. Because sounds of central origin are attenuated as they are transmitted peripherally through normal air-filled lung, voice-generated sounds have a muffled quality and the words are indistinct. In contrast, in the presence of consolidation, the characteristics of the sounds are remarkably different. The term egophony (Audio indicates sounds that have a high-pitched, bleating quality; a change in sound-filtering properties of consolidated lungs accounts for the presence of egophony, which does not require, as often stated, the presence of an overlying pleural effusion. Bronchophony (Audio 16-9) and pectoriloquy (Audio 16-10) both mean that spoken sounds are transmitted with increased intensity and pitch; when each syllable of every word, especially when whispered, is distinct and easily recognized, pectoriloquy is the preferred description. An E-to-A sign means that the spoken letter \"E\" sounds like \"A\" while listened to over the lungs. Each of these auscultatory findings is a manifestation of the same acoustic property of consolidated lungs and thus has similar diagnostic significance.",

Clubbing is easy to recognize when it is severe (Fig. 16-3) , but subtle changes are more common and less reliable. The hallmarks of clubbing are (1) a softening and periungual erythema of the nail beds, which causes the nails to seem to float rather than to be firmly attached, (2) an increase of the normal 165-degree angle that the nail makes with its cuticle, (3) an enlargement or bulging of the distal phalanx, which may be warm and erythematous, and (4) a curvature of the nails themselves. Of these features, the straightening of the nail cuticle angle appears to be the most sensitive measurement. 93 Patients with clubbing may also have hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, a condition characterized by subperiosteal formation of new cancellous bone at the distal ends of such as Mycoplasma pneumonia, typically cause surprisingly few physical abnormalities despite extensive radiographic involvement (see eFig. but, even in patients with classic lobar pneumonia, the findings may be nonspecific. Although unable to distinguish reliably between newonset pneumonia and other pulmonary diseases, the findings from physical examination-vital signs, mental conditions in which clubbing has been observed. 94 One of the striking features of clubbing is the speed with which it can develop, about 2 weeks in patients with new-onset empyema, and with which it can reverse, also about 2 weeks in patients after corrective cardiac surgery. The presence of clubbing, which was found in 1% of all admissions to an internal medicine department, was associated with \"serious disease\" in 40% of afflicted patients 95 ; therefore new-onset clubbing always warrants a chest radiograph, and if no abnormality is found, a CT scan to look for a pulmonary neoplasm or other lesion, which may still be localized and curable. Clubbing has been found in many diverse conditions, such as children with HIV, 96 hepatopulmonary syndrome, 97 and benign asbestos pleural disease 98 (Table 16 -4) . Both clubbing and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy can be idiopathic or familial; the familial form is often transmitted as a dominant trait. The hereditary form of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is also called pachydermoperiostosis, a condition in which bone and joint involvement is often mild but furrowing of the skin of the face and scalp is usually marked.",
