The predicted polypeptide shares between 27 and 31 o/o sequence identities with the PBl polypeptides of influenza A, B, and C viruses.

Dhori viruses have been isolated from a variety of tick and vertebrate species (Anderson and Casals, 1973; Filipe and Casals, 1979; Karabat-SOS, 1985; Williams et a/., 1973) . The genome of the virus consists of seven unique segments of singlestranded RNA with a total size of approximately 1 1.9 kb. The viral RNAs have been shown to encode information in the negative-sense (Clerx et al., 1983; Fuller et al., 1987; Freedman-Faulstich and Fuller, 1990) and it was previously shown that the Dhori nucleoprotein (encoded by RNA segment 5) shares conserved amino acid sequences with the influenza A, B, and C virus nucleoproteins (Fuller et al., 1987) . The sequence of RNA segment 4 encodes the single envelope protein of Dhori virus (Freedman-Faulstich and Fuller, 1990) . The envelope protein does not share sequence identity with any orthomyxovirus envelope protein. We have also determined the nucleotide sequence of the Dhori segment 6 RNA and this segment most likely encodes the viral matrix protein (unpublished data). The 3'and 5' nontranslated ends of RNA segments 4, 5, and 6 are very similar to the conserved ends of the genes of the recognized members of the Orthomyxoviridae (Clerx et ' To whom correspondence and requests for reprints should be addressed. a/., Fuller et a/., 1987; Freedman-Faulstich and Fuller, 1990) and segment 3 of Thogoto virus (Staunton et al., 1989) .",

The PBl polymerase proteins are the most highly conserved among the proteins of the influenza A, B, and C viruses (Yamashita et a/,, 1989 ) and they are most likely required for nucleotide addition during viral RNA synthesis (Braam et al., 1983) . A pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequence identities of the Dhori virus protein and the influenza A, B, and C virus PBl proteins are shown in Table 1 . The optimized alignments were made by the method of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) and indicate that the Dhori PBllike protein shares sequence identities of 30.7, 26.9, and 29.8% with the PBl proteins of influenza AIPRf8/ 34, influenza B/Ann Arbor/i/66, and influenza C/JJ/50 virus, respectively (Table 1 ). In addition, we compared the sequence of the Dhori PBl-like protein to the PBl proteins of influenza A, B, and C viruses using the PCOMPARE (Intelligenetics) program. This program determines the probability that the similarity between two sequences could occur by chance. The score is expressed as the number of standard deviation units by which the maximum score for the real sequences exceeds the average maximum score for 100 randomizations of the sequence. An alignment score greater than 5 (probability of similarity occurring by chance < 3 X 10p7) implies an evolutionary relationship between proteins (Dayhoff et al., 1983) . Pairwise comparisons (see Table 1 above diagonal) between Dhori and influenza PBl proteins yield alignment scores of 25-26 which clearly indicate an evolutionary relationship between the Dhori virus PBl-like protein and the influenza PBl proteins. A similar comparison between the Dhori segment 2 gene product and the influenza A/PR/ 8/34 PB2 protein and PA protein gave alignment scores of 0.25 and 0.015, respectively.",

            "text": "A comparison of some of the physical properties of the Dhori and influenza PBl proteins indicates that the Dhori protein is the smallest in this group (716 amino acids; M, 81,292) and unlike the influenza PBl proteins which have a strong positive charge at neutral pH (+23-A/PR/8/34; +12-B/AA/i/66; +14-C/U/50) the Dhori protein is slightly acidic with a charge of -10 (PEPTIDESORT; Devereux et al., 1984) . Since the nomenclature of the influenza virus polymerase proteins is based on their charge characteristics a different name for the related protein of Dhori virus may be appropriate and we thus suggest the designation Pa protein. This nomenclature is proposed for the designation of the Dhori polymerase proteins [Pa-(PBl), Pp-(PB2), and Pr-(PA)] since the charge characteristics do not appear to be constant across virus groups. For example, the PA-like polymerase protein of influenza C/JJ/50 virus (Yamashita eta/., 1989 ) encodes a weakly basic protein designated P3 (segment 3 gene product). The third largest RNA segment of Thogoto virus encodes a PA-like protein with only a very weak negative charge (-2.5 at pH 7.0; Staunton et al., 1989) .",

            "text": "Genes of other viruses also share sequence identity with influenza virus segments. It has been previously demonstrated that some members of the coronavirus group and influenza C virus have a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein that recognizes the same Nacetyl-9-0-acetylneuraminic acid receptors on cells (Vlasak et a/., 1988) . The influenza C virus HE glycoprotein shares an approximately 30% amino acid sequence identity with a coronavirus HE glycoprotein present in bovine coronavirus (Kienzle et al., 1990 ) and mouse hepatitis virus (Luytjes et a/., 1988) . This example of significant identity between a plus-strand RNA and a minus-strand RNA virus supports the concept of a cassette model of evolution for the HE gene and is most likely an example of a recombinational event. In contrast, we feel that the relationship of the Dhori virus group to the orthomyxovirus group is most likely an example of divergent evolution in light of the similarities in genome structure and common replication strategies and of the observation that several Dhori virus gene products share significant identity with orthomyxovirus genes.",
