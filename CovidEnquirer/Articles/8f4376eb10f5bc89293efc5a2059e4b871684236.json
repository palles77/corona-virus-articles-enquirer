In previous works we have demonstrated that the Z arenavirus matrix protein represents an attractive target for antiviral therapy. With the aim of studying a new alternative therapeutic mechanism, four Z-specific siRNAs (Z1-to Z4-siRNAs) were tested showing variable efficacy. The most effective inhibitor was Z2-siRNA targeted at the region encompassed by nt 179-197 of Z gene. The efficacy of this Z2-siRNA against JUNV was also demonstrated in virus-infected cells, by testing infectious virus plaque formation (92.8% JUNV yield reduction), viral RNA level or antigen expression, as well as in cells transfected with Z-specific reporter plasmids (91% reduction in expression of Z-EGFP fusion protein). Furthermore, the lack of effect of this Z-siRNA on the expression of other JUNV proteins, such as N and GPC, confirmed the specificity of action exerted by Z2-siRNA on Z transcript. Thus, the present study represents the first report of virus inhibition mediated by RNA interference for a New World arenavirus.",

It has been shown that Z exerted an inhibitory effect on viral RNA synthesis de la Torre, 2001, 2002; L\u00f3pez et al., 2001) . In addition to this regulatory role, Z was also implicated as a virion component with matrix functions, similar to other enveloped negative-strand viruses (Neuman et al., 2005; Perez et al., 2003; Salvato et al., 1992; Salvato, 1993; Strecker et al., 2003) . Consistent with its features, Z presents a RING finger and a canonical late domain motif that enable Z to interact with the host cell (Borden et al., 1998; Campbell-Dwyer et al., 2000; Djavani et al., 2005) and viral proteins. Furthermore, Z-mediated budding requires its myristoyl modification (Perez et al., 2004) , which likely facilitates Z association with membranes at budding sites. Thus, Z has an essential role in the particle formation.",

First, the inhibitory action of Z-siRNA on the expression of the fusion protein Z-EGFP was determined by co-transfection of Vero cells with the plasmid pcDNA3.1-Z-EGFP and either the Z-siRNA or the non-silencing X-siRNA. A series of co-transfections of the reporter plasmid pcDNA3.1-EGFP and the siRNAs were assayed in parallel. At 48 h post-transfection, EGFP fluorescence was analyzed. The EGFP protein was highly expressed in cells transfected with the reporter plasmid in the presence of co-transfected Z-siRNA or X-siRNA (Fig. 3A, panels A and B) . The control non-silencing X-siRNAs had no apparent effect on Z-EGFP expression (Fig. 3A, panel C) , whereas the four specific Z-siRNAs produced a marked reduction in fluorescence (Fig. 3A , panels D-G). As observed in virus yield assay, Z2-siRNA appeared to silence Z-EGFP gene expression more efficiently than the other Z-siRNAs. In fact, the quantification of fluorescent cells showed that Z1-to Z4-siRNA reduced expression of the Z-EGFP fusion protein in comparison to X-siRNA by 67.4, 91.0, 46.9 and 45.2%, respectively (Fig. 3B) .",

It was evident from the results shown in Fig. 3C and D that the Z-specific siRNA reduced the amount of detectable Z-Flag fusion protein in both assays whereas the co-transfection of Vero cells with the control non-silencing X-siRNA failed to block the synthesis of Z-Flag fusion protein. It is also worth to note that the expression in the same cell samples of a non-targeted host protein, actin (ca. 45 kDa), remained almost unaffected (Fig. 3D) . To gain further evidence for the specificity of Z-siRNAs, we investigated whether the presence of Z2-siRNA could decrease other transiently expressed JUNV proteins. To this end, cells were co-transfected with the Z2-siRNA or X-siRNA and plasmids pcD-NAHisMAX A-N or pcDNAHisMAX A-GPC encoding N and GPC JUNV proteins, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 , no effect on N and GPC expression could be detected by indirect immunofluorescence using specific monoclonal antibodies against these proteins, respectively, suggesting that off-target effects are not the cause of the JUNV yield reduction observed in Fig. 1 . 4 .

            "text": "In conclusion, results presented here have shown the effective inhibitory action against the arenavirus JUNV by siRNAs directed against the sequence of the Z transcript. Four Z-specific siRNAs were tested showing variable efficacy. The most effective inhibitor was Z2-siRNA, targeted to the region encompassed by nt 179-197 of Z gene. The efficacy of this agent against JUNV was also demonstrated in virus-infected cells by testing infectious virus plaque formation, viral RNA or antigen expression, as well as in cells transfected with Z-specific reporter plasmids. Furthermore, the lack of effect of this siRNA on the expression of other JUNV proteins, such as N and GPC, confirmed the specificity of action exerted by Z2-siRNA on Z transcript. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect observed in the release of JUNV infectious progeny by Z2-siRNA (>90% inhibition at 24 h p.i.) is similar to the effect described in transient transfection of siRNAs for other viruses, but higher than the activity recently reported for siRNAs targeted to the termini of N and L genes in the arenavirus LASV (M\u00fcller and G\u00fcnther, 2007) . It remains to be investigated if the antiviral potential of RNA interference for JUNV infections here shown after transient transfection of synthetic siRNA targeted to Z gene can be improved by using a viral vector of a short hairpin RNA that resembles siRNAs precursors. However, siRNAs elicit potent effects at relatively low doses; so as to minimize the interference with naturally occurring processes, current therapeutic efforts seem to be focused towards the use of a pool of synthetic unmodified naked siRNAs (Davis, 2009) .",

It would be an ideal situation to get an antiviral approach effective against all these pathogens. Regarding infectious diseases, ongoing clinical trials in the field of siRNA are developed by different companies and most of them are in the preclinical stage, with the exception of HBV and HIV studies that are in phase I, and the most advanced program concerning the treatment of infection by RSV using siRNA developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals that has just finished phase II (L\u00f3pez-Fraga et al., 2008) . Given the diversity of arenaviruses, it will be difficult to design a siRNA treatment able to cross-inhibit several species in the family, even using a highly conserved sequence as antiviral target. In contrast with the cross-reactivity among the Old World arenaviruses LASV, LCMV and Mopeia virus reported with siRNAs targeted to LASV (M\u00fcller and G\u00fcnther, 2007) , in our study we observed no efficacy when JUNV designed Z-siRNAs were used to inhibit the close antigenically related New World arenavirus TCRV. Even, the effectiveness against other JUNV strain was reduced when there is more than one nucleotide change in the target sequence, as shown for Z1-and Z2-siRNA against IV 4454 and XJCl3 JUNV strains (Figs. 1A and 2). Thus, given the variability observed among natural and experimentally isolated JUNV strains (as shown in Fig. 2A for the Z gene of IV 4454 , Rumero, XJCl3, XJ13 and Candid 1 strains), more detailed studies will be necessary in the design of RNAi-based therapeutics for successful clinical intervention of human pathogenic arenaviruses.",
