Design & methods: A total of 2787 family and non-family visitors entering through the glass sliding door of 6 pediatric wards at a university children's hospital were observed for 4 h, respectively, before and after interventions between April 27 and May 20, 2018. In the first intervention, a visual stimulus emphasized the location of the hand sanitizer. In the second intervention, an additional auditory stimulus transmitted a cue through a motion sensor speaker. Results: During the preliminary observation, the HHC rates of family and non-family visitors were 0.0% and 1.5%, respectively; after the visual stimulus, they were 0.6% and 5.4%, and after the audio-visual stimulus, 1.8% and 8.2%. There was a significant increase in the overall HHC with the visual (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.76-20.90) and audio-visual (OR, 8.67; 95% CI, 3.08-33.70) stimuli (Fisher's exact test, p b .05). Conclusions: The HHC of family and non-family visitors entering pediatric wards was very low and the audiovisual stimulus was found to be more effective than was the visual stimulus alone. Practice implications: To reduce healthcare-associated infection, pediatric wards must actively implement effective interventions. Using audio-visual stimulation to increase HHC among visitors will provide advantages. Follow-up research should examine the current state of HHC among visitors in various locations and conditions.",

Since the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2015, hospitals at various levels have announced visiting hours. They have also installed glass sliding doors to block infection routes. However, pediatric wards are an exception; they issue one access card per pediatric patient to authorize access to guardians for reasons such as mental security of hospitalized children and consent for treatment procedures. Given that young children are more likely to cross-infections in ambulatory settings and hospitalized facilities (Buet et al., 2013; McBride, 2018) , visitors (family and nonfamily) must engage in minimum health behaviors for infection prevention before entering pediatric wards. The easiest prevention measure is engaging in hand hygiene using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.",

Previous studies suggest methods such as verifying compliance rates using recorders or electronic surveillance systems (Ellison, Barysauskas, Barton, Rundensteiner, & Wang, 2015; Srigley, Furness, Baker, & Gardam, 2014) , and analyzing related factors such as knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and education experiences regarding hand hygiene through Abbreviations: Before, before intervention; Vis, visual stimulation; AV, audio-visual stimulation. a Frequency of hand hygiene compliance over observations. self-report surveys and interviews (Alsubaie et al., 2013; Kumar, Arya, Chellani, Deb, & Shankar, 2018) . Non-family visitors likely showed a higher HHC rate because they paid attention to unfamiliar surroundings including signage and audible directions. Fakhry, Hanna, Anderson, Holmes, and Nathwani (2012) reported visitors showed higher persistence of HHC than healthcare providers to an audible hand hygiene reminder. Furthermore, it could be a consequence of family members' need for reminders through various methods to increase their HHC. One such method, audio-visual stimulation, has many advantages including its low cost, high effectiveness, and ability to use without prior knowledge.

Audio-visual stimulation was identified as an effective method of increasing HHC. Although the improvement in HHC was significant, the overall HHC of family and nonfamily members remained low. Based on the results of the study, follow-up research by medical institutions should examine the current state of HHC of visitors in various interventions and conditions.",
