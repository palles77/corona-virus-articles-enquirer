These astonishing outcomes obtained by scientists exploiting graphene in many fields, including sensor technology, resulted in the largest research initiative in the European Union (UE) with the \"Graphene Flagship\", tasked with taking graphene from laboratories into the market with a h1 billion budget [2]. If it is well established that nanomaterials entail inorganic materials, there is a new emerging vision, according to which biological materials as DNA and proteins can be considered as nanoscale entities being capable of folding in nanostructures [3\u00c05]. As reported by Nature Nanotechnology journal \"the ability of DNA to selfassemble into a variety of nanostructures and nanomachines is highlighted in a growing number of papers in Nature Nanotechnology. The appeal of DNA to nanoscientists is threefold: first, it is a natural nanoscale material; second, a large number of techniques for studying DNA are already available; and third, its ability to carry information can be exploited in the self-assembly process. DNA is also increasingly being used to organize other nanomaterials, and the related field of RNA nanotechnology is beginning to emerge\" [6]. DNA is largely exploited as biological recognition elements (bioreceptors) in the design of biosensors, a branch of sensor technology. Beside DNA, enzymes are also used as biological recognition elements for catalytic detection as well as peptides and antibodies for affinity detection.",

In the absence of the pathogen, the Ab-QD probes extensively interact through \u03c0\u00c0\u03c0 stacking with GO, which quenches their fluorescence. When the pathogens are selectively captured by the Ab-QD probes, they fluoresce when excited with a laser, since a weaker interaction occurs with GO that, in this configuration, is not more capable of strong fluorescence quenching. As a model pathogen to test the system, Escherichia coli O157:H7.16 was used, while QDs were (core-shell) CdSe@ZnS QDs functionalized with streptavidin. This biosensing approach led to a highly specific and sensitive analysis, noticeable up to 10 CFU mL 21 in standard buffer and 100 CFU mL 21 in bottled water and milk.",

Yoon et al. [30] covalently conjugated the periplasmic glucose-binding protein from E. coli with carboxylated poly(vinyl alcohol)wrapped SWNTs, leading to allosterically controlled optical transduction by reversible exciton quenching in response to glucose. Glucose-binding protein is characterized by two domains linked by a \"hinge\" region; it binds the sugar with very high specificity undergoing a conformational change in which the two domains close around the glucose. This actuation resulted in changes of the polymer\u00c0SWCNT interaction, ultimately causing a highly selective and reversible SWCNT fluorescent quenching, proportional to the glucose concentration. Changes in fluorescence emission of glucose-binding protein/SWNTs were analyzed at different glucose concentrations, over a long observation time ( . 60 h), thanks to the photostability of SWNT.",

After Ni 21 chelation, NTA\u00c0Ni 21 complexes work as proximity quenchers, modulating the intrinsic SWCNT fluorescence intensity as a function of distance from the SWCNT surface. The Ni 21 \u00c0NTA group binds to any capture protein, which possesses a hexahistidine tag. Upon target binding to the capture protein, a variation of Ni 21 -SWCNT distance occurred, allowing for the evaluation of protein binding by means of fluorescence intensity changes. 21 ions act as proximity quenchers of the nanotube fluorescence. Upon binding of a histagged capture protein, the distance of the ion from the SWCNT surface decreases, resulting in a fluorescence-quenching response. Upon binding of an analyte protein to the his-tagged capture protein, a further fluorescence modulation occurs, allowing for direct detection of the binding event [31] .",

Only after 2010 there was a relevant growth of publication number describing CB as electrode nanomodifier. Our group highlighted the mesmerizing electrochemical characteristics of CB in the ink/paste as well as in modifying electrodes by drop-casting to reveal many analytes as catechol, hydrogen peroxide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and thiocholine [32\u00c035]. Our results were validated by other groups: Compton's group [36] reported the gain of using CB over the more specialized MWCNTs in terms of sensitivity toward the detection of nicotine by adsorbitive stripping voltammetry, because the presence of CB allowed higher current responses for nicotine oxidation at lower potentials. Pumera's group [37] demonstrated that CB is more suitable than the thermally reduced GO, being cheaper and not requiring any chemical and physical treatment before use. Fatibello-Filho's group [38] as well as Evtugyn's group [39] successfully used CB-modified electrodes for the detection of different analytes. Arduini et al. [35] reported a miniaturized and disposable electrochemical sensor for phenolic compound detection constructed by modifying the working electrode surface of SPEs with CB dispersion (Fig. 13.7A ). This sensor showed higher sensitivity and better resistance to fouling than the bare SPE, displaying the suitability of CB as an excellent electrode nanomodifier. Catechol, gallic acid, caffeic acid, and tyrosol were detected by square-wave voltammetry with detection limits of 0.1, 1, 0.8, and 2 \u03bcM, respectively.",

Morales-Narv\u00e1ez and coworkers [41] explored the ability of different carbon nanomaterials as quencher in comparison with the most used QDs for FRET measurements. In this regard, the authors exploited QDs as donors and graphite, CNTs, CNFs, and GO as energy acceptors of FRET from QDs. The responses of the explored carbon-based materials as acceptors of QD FRET donors in the proposed platform are displayed in Fig. 13 .8. They observed that graphite was a weak acceptor for spots deposited from high concentration suspensions (0.5\u00c01 mg mL 21 ), while for thinner films at graphite lower concentrations (0.125\u00c00.25 mg mL 21 ), graphite becomes a strong acceptor. Both CNT and CNF in general behave as stronger acceptors in comparison to graphite, whereas, as observed, the strongest quenching is caused by GO at all the studied concentration values (from 0.125 to 1 mg GO mL 21 ).",

In this work, two kind of paper-based substrates, namely filter and copy papers, have been evaluated toward the realization of an affordable device capable to detect targets in few microliters of undiluted serum samples. The AuNPs have been obtained by making an Au precursor salt reacting with a reductant (sodium borohydride) and a capping agent (sodium citrate). However, it should be considered that the synthesis of the final B20 nm NPs needed very clean glassware (in fact, aqua regia and piranha solution have been used for cleaning). The role of AuNPs was dual: they served as anchor points for the attachment of the thiol-extremity of the DNA probe, and they produced an obvious improvement of the electrochemical properties compared to unmodified graphite-based printed electrodes. AuNPs allowed, at a very low cost of production, to reach detection limit of 3 and 7 nM, respectively, for ss and ds sequences. In comparison with the classical approaches, that involve the use of Au macroelectrode, the use of AuNPs for DNA sensing is highly recommendable especially in terms of surface-to-volume ratio. The use of AuNPs has been also adopted for the analysis of heavy metals in environmental context such as the detection of arsenic in surface waters [47] and mercury in soil [48] . Clear advantages must be attributed to the combined presence of AuNPs and CB. The latter allowed increasing the spreading of AuNPs on the top of the SPE area, thus augmenting the available area for detecting the metals. Arsenic and mercury have been detected, respectively, down to 0.4 and 3 ppb as detection limits. The extremely high portability of the platforms permitted to carry out the measurements directly on-site, reducing costs and time-consuming procedures of laboratory-based settings.",

The determination of bacteria is due to non-specific affinity interactions between bacteria's walls and AuAg NSs surface. The electrochemical mechanism is because if the AuAg NSs are exposed to a high concentration of halides and dissolved oxygen, Ag 1 cations can be produced by galvanic corrosion without compromising the particles' structural stability, and anodic stripping analysis can be performed. This proof-ofconcept approach allowed reaching high sensitivities down to 10 2 CFU mL 21 in only 10 min. However, this assay was not able to distinguish and quantify different bacterial strains in complex mixtures and the presence of interfering species such as copper and mercury, lead to an electrochemical quenched effect due to suspected formation of alloys and amalgams between these cations (Cu 21 , Hg 21 ) and the noble metals, Au and Ag, constituting the NSs, as reported in Fig. 13 .9B.",

Briefly, a biotinylated primary anti-S. aureus aptamer was fixed onto streptavidincoated magnetic beads that served as the capture agent. Subsequently, a second anti-S. aureus aptamer (conjugated to AgNPs by means of S\u00c0Ag covalent bond) was allowed to form a sandwich structure with the bacterium, and the electrochemical signal of Ag ions was carried out by means of anodic stripping voltammetry (in strong acidic conditions). The electrochemical immunosensor displayed a dynamic range comprised between 10 and 10 6 CFU mL 21 with a detection limit calculated (S/N 5 3) equal to 1 CFU mL 21 . Authors claimed that the sensitivity of the developed assay is strictly dependent on the Ag ions released by each NP, that is, 10 6 ions from a 40-nm particle. In addition, the use of AgNPs instead of AuNPs should be preferred also because the electrochemical redox reactions of Ag occur at lower potentials with respect to those needed by colloidal Au.",

CuNPs have been used to modify the electrodic surface for the detection of nitrite and nitrate ions in food and beverages samples. The authors developed a sensing tool by electrodepositing CuNPs onto a layer composed by multiwalled CNTs-reduced GONs [45] (Fig. 13.9C ). The presence of CuNPs was necessary to carry out nitrite and nitrate detection at the glassy carbon electrode. In addition, the combination between carbonaceous material and copper allowed reaching a two-fold enhancement of the platform sensitivity. Both the ions were detected by square-wave voltammetry within the 0.1\u00c075 \u03bcM range with detection limits of 20 and 30 nM, respectively, for nitrate and nitrite ions. An experimental issue demonstrated the effect of chloride ions in solution, similar for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and nitrate: their presence might form a surface layer onto the modified electrode, altering the double layer characteristics; to avoid this, an Ag-impregnated filter could be used to remove the excess of chloride ions.",

The synthesis has been entirely attributed to the composition and structure of paper, and NPs of B20 nm have been produced. This approach represented the first paper-based mediated synthesis of NPs and the so-called \"Paper Blue\" has been applied toward the detection of glucose in whole blood. This biosensor was capable to detect glucose linearly up to 25 mM, and the presence of Prussian Blue NPs highlighted a high selectivity even in the presence of common potential blood interferents, for example, ascorbic acid, uric acid, and acetaminophen.

The dissolution of AuNPs represents a new mechanism: in fact, they can be dissolved by a mild oxidant in the presence of CTAB, exhibiting an evident shift from red to colorless. In this case, when the enzymatic substrate (acetylthiocoline) is converted by AChE, the by-product thiocholine protects AuNPs from dissolution; instead, when the inhibitor is present, the enzymatic reaction does not occur properly, AuNPs are oxidized to Au 31 /CTAB and the color changes from red to pink/colorless.

The difference between the NCs and NPs is in the color; while the former is colorless, the latter is yellow. The NCs represent the catalyst for promoting the synthesis of AgNPs, with an associated change of the plasmon absorption spectra at 420 nm. With this procedure, ascorbic acid has been detected in the range comprised between 0.25 and 50 \u03bcM, with a limit of detection as low as B79 nM (using a spectrophotometer), while the detection limit observed for colorimetric assays taken by the photographs was B1 \u03bcM.",

They observed that the color change happened only when both the thiol (SH) and amine (NH 2 ) groups were present in the analyte: CuNPs detected Cys after 2 min while 3 h were necessary to sense L-cysteine ethyl ester (CEE). This behavior can be attributed to the bulkier size of CEE, which may have delayed the contact of SH and NH 2 group with CuNPs. The absorbance peak of CuNPs decreased when the Cys concentration increased, displaying a linear range up to 25 \u03bcM with a detection limit of 0.1 \u03bcM.",

Authors observed a change in color from red to yellow, supposed to be a consequence of complexation between picric acid and capped-CuNPs: picric acid removes cefuroxime around CuNPs, provoking the aggregation of NPs. The limit of detection was determined to be 38 nM, and the method was capable to provide a linear signal up to a level of 20 \u03bcM of picric acid. In addition, the system was evaluated also in presence of species commonly present in aqueous matrices such as pentachlorophenol, 4-nitroanaline, hydroquinone, Cd 21 , Ni 21 , Co 21 , As 31 , Cr 31 and Hg 21 , but only the presence of picric acid was consistent with color change from red to yellow as shown in Fig. 13 .10C.",

Chau et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of PtNPs on reduced GO as peroxidase mimetic for the colorimetric detection of specific DNA sequences [71] . In particular, authors took advantage of the synergic combination of PtNPs and graphene: the former is characterized by a peroxidase-like activity, the latter allows stacking interactions with ss-DNA but not with the ds ones. The assay involved the hybridization of a target sequence with its complementary probe sequence, followed by the addition of hybrid nanocomposite PtNPs/rGO. If the concentration of target is low, the nanocomposite is able to bind with the single-stranded probe and it is stabilized against aggregation. After centrifugation, the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide leads to an intense blue color. Instead, if the level of target is high, the target/probe duplex can be formed, making the nanocomposite aggregated and thus reducing the recovered PtNPs/rGO after centrifugation; the result is a pale blue production upon the addition of TMB and hydrogen peroxide. The linear range and limit of detection of this assay platform were 0.5\u00c010 and 0.4 nM, respectively.",

Beyond the electrochemical properties, this material is very interesting because of its change in color between the different oxidation states: when Prussian Blue is reduced to Prussian White, its color changes from blue to colorless. Having in mind this mechanism, Bagheri and colleagues developed the first paper-based multiplatform highlighting the fading of Prussian Blue for sensing the enzymatic activity [65] , as reported in Fig. 13 .10D. They reported a 96-well chromatographic paper-based platform for the detection of BChE enzyme activity in human serum. Prussian Blue NPs were reagentlessly synthesized within the paper's structure as already reported [65] . The principle of BChE activity detection relies on the reaction between the enzymatic product thiocholine and Prussian Blue. The presence of thiocholine is able to reduce Prussian Blue forming the reduced form, namely Prussian White. The use of a common office scanner was sufficient to detect BChE activity down to 0.8 U mL 21 and linearly within a range of 2\u00c015 U mL 21 .",

The Ce 31 /Ce 41 ratio present in Nanoceria significantly affects its peroxidase-mimetic activity. The combination of this novel material with porphyrin has been evaluated in order to estimate the advantage in adopting a functional molecular material with large conjugated electronic structure. Liu et al. prepared a nanocomposite made with ceria nanorods and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyl phenyl)-porphyrin (H 2 TCPP), namely H 2 TCPP\u00c0CeO 2 [72] . This nanocomposite exhibited an intrinsic peroxidase-like activity toward hydrogen peroxide and TMB similarly to horseradish peroxidase enzyme. The combination of these two materials led to a synergistic effect: the electrons can be easily transferred from the conduction band of porphyrin to the conduction band ceria due to the lower level of CeO 2 than that of porphyrin. In the presence of glucose oxidase, the reported approach was capable to detect glucose down to 3.3 3 10 25 M within a dynamic range between 5.0 3 10 25 and 1.0 3 10 24 M. However, as for the previous section, the use of this nanocomposite in majority is related to its enzyme-like activity.",

In terms of application, they are still at a proof-of-concept stage of tiny objects demonstrating capabilities to autonomously perform different tasks: transporting cargo, destroying cells, remediate pollution. In this direction, the integration of nano/micro entities within electroanalytical and colorimetric devices is highly recommendable. The first combination of micromotors with a SPE has been reported, using Mg-Au-Ni Janus microengines for accelerated destruction of nerve agents, and consequent detection of the non-hazardous remediated product (p-nitrophenol) [76] . In this work, smart micromotors were capable of producing OH 2 ions to increase the pH of the medium and consequently promote the alkaline degradation of paraoxon into a readily detectable p-nitrophenol, Fig. 13 .11A. In addition, the produced H 2 allowed obtaining a rapid and reproducible nerve-agent degradation with a subsequent detection without the need of external stirrers or mixing devices. The use of microengines leads to a 15-fold increased sensitivity toward organophosphate pesticide detection, compared to a nonengineered SPE.

As illustrated, these NPs are suitable to be combined with each other and/or with different biological elements, producing new nanocomposites always with enhanced performances. Their use also permits for the miniaturization of the platforms, allowing for the realization of wearable devices for the real-time monitoring of physiological parameters. In addition, the miniaturization of platforms paves the way for coupling them with another emerging field: the wearable electronics.
