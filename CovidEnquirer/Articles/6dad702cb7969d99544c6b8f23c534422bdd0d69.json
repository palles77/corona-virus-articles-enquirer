This study determined the frequency of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) associated with hMPV in the Republic of Ireland. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 168 adult patients and respiratory specimens from 122 children aged < 5 years were collected between September 2003 and May 2004. The virus was detected by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR using hMPV polymerase (L) and matrix (M)-specific primers in four (2.4%) of 171 BAL specimens obtained from 168 adults. No other respiratory virus was detected in these specimens, and no hMPV RNA was detected in respiratory specimens from children during the same time period. In all four adult cases, two of whom had underlying disease, hMPV was associated with mild, self-limiting upper RTIs. The most common clinical findings included fever (3 \u2044 4 patients), cough (4 \u2044 4) and rhinorrhoea (3 \u2044 4). No patient died as a result of these RTI episodes. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the amplified regions of the M and fusion (F) genes of hMPV. The Irish isolates belonged to cluster 1B, and did not show a separate Irish sub-lineage.",

Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated the existence of two genetic subgroups of hMPV, exemplified by the Canadian strains CAN97-83 (genotype 1) and CAN98-75 (genotype 2) [3] . By analogy with hRSV, it was assumed that these distinct genetic lineages would represent different antigenic subgroups. However, it has been shown that the two hMPV genetic groups are highly related antigenically, and that the fusion protein is a major contributor to this antigenic relatedness [4] . No zoonotic source for hMPV is known, despite similarities between hMPV and avian pneumovirus type C [2, 5] . Infection appears to be seasonal, and resembles that caused by hRSV in that it occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in the winter months [2, 6, 7] .",

The frequency of hMPV infection in hospitalised children was reported as 5.5% in one study, with hMPV-positive children presenting with mildto-severe RTIs [13] . Furthermore, other data indicate that hMPV accounts for at least 5-7% of RTIs in hospitalised children [26] . Specimens, including BALs, collected in the present study were obtained in the same period as BALs from Irish adults with hMPV-associated infections. Improper storage of the specimens from children is very unlikely. Retrospective testing for hRSV by RT-PCR using 66 of the stored specimens proved more sensitive than biological methods (18.1% vs. 12%; results not shown). Furthermore, known hMPV-positive NPAs from a hospital in the UK were used successfully as positive controls, even though the specimens had been frozen and thawed on at least two occasions. An underestimation of the percentage of hMPVpositive samples was observed when only specimens negative for other respiratory viruses were tested for hMPV [17] . It is also possible that a new lineage of hMPV, not amplified by the primers used for RT-PCR, could have caused RTIs in young Irish children. However, phylogenetic analysis of the hMPV isolates from the four adult Irish patients showed that the circulating strains in 2003-2004 belonged to the well-recognised 1B lineage. It is also possible that the occurrence of hMPV shows a seasonal variation, perhaps with sporadic epidemics. Temporal variation in the pattern of hMPV infection has been demonstrated in young and elderly adults, with hMPV illness rates of 1.5% and 7.0% in the winter seasons of 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, respectively [9] . Furthermore, another study [19] showed that the incidence of hMPV infection in infants varied substantially from season to season over a 3-year period, with a positivity rate of 7% in 2001, compared to 40% in 2000 and 2002.",
