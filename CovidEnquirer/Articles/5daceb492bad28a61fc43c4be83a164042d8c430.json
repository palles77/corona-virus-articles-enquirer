An NSP5 43 trans-complementing cell line was used to generate and characterise several 44 recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5.

We showed that the rRV mutant 50 strains exhibit impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped 51 viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we have investigated the mechanism of 52 NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-53 negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines 54 expressing either wt NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results 55 indicate that NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of 56 round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 57 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 58 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional 59 viral factories in other RNA viruses. 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 .

The non-structural 69 protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during 70 RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. 71 However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been 72 directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse genetics (RG) 73 system for rotaviruses. Here we show a novel application of a recently developed 74 RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell 75 line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach 76 allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein 77 during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants we shed light 78 on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and 79 its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent 80 viroplasms. 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97",

We demonstrated that 539 despite the presence of Ser67, deletion mutant NSP5/\uf044T was not phosphorylated 540 and failed to form viroplasms. We have previously shown that co-expression of 541 NSP5/\uf044T was also unable to trigger the phosphorylation cascade of NSP5/S67A, 542 while other NSP5 mutants referred hereafter as activators of phosphorylation, 543 e.g., NSP5/\uf0443 did (24). Interestingly, upon co-infection with two rRVs 544 NSP5/S67A and NSP5/\uf044T, both mutated NSP5 variants were not phosphorylated 545 (Table 1 and Fig. 8B, lanes 3-4) . The NSP5-\uf044176-180 mutant 548 was also unable to induce phosphorylation of NSP5/S67A following the co-549 infection with the two rRVs, despite both containing Ser67 and the C-terminal tail. 550",

Of the two non-structural proteins involved in viroplasm assembly, NSP5 appears 601 to play a crucial role by potentially providing a scaffold that allows for recruitment 602 of additional viral proteins. Only when NSP5 is co-expressed with NSP2 and/or 603 VP2, these proteins assemble into the viroplasm-like structures (VLS), which are 604 also capable to recruit additional structural proteins including VP1, VP2 and VP6 605 (8, 10). Given these observations, we hypothesised that complete removal of 606 NSP5 would be lethal for RV replication. Using a modified reverse genetics Using the NSP5 mutant strains described above and the established stable 673 transfectant MA104 cells we were able to investigate the molecular mechanism 674 that leads to NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. We showed that the NSP5/S67A 675 mutant from the rRV was indeed hyperphosphorylated, albeit not completely, 676 .

Interestingly, this indicates that the NSP5-415 EGPF fusion protein is not able to trans-complement the lack of NSP5, and 416 indeed the rRV-NSP5/KO strain does not replicate in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells. 417 Furthermore, both genomic dsRNA synthesis and infectious progeny virus 418 production were completely abrogated in MA104 cells, but not in the trans-419",

Its replication in wild type MA104 cells was 427 strongly impaired (Fig. 3B right panel), resulting in approximately a 100-fold 428 reduction of the infectious progeny virus titre at different time points post-infection 429 (Fig. 3C). Despite the overall reduction of replication fitness, the rRV-NSP5/S67A 430 mutant virus was stable after 10 passages in the wild-type MA104 cells, 431 confirmed by the sequencing of the progeny virus. Consistent with our previous 432 Ser67 in the initiation of NSP5 phosphorylation cascade (24). While the wt 435 rRV yielded multiple hyper-phosphorylated NSP5 isoforms, the NSP5/S67A 436 mutant mostly produced a single, homogeneous form of NSP5 with an apparent 437 mass of 26 kDa that could be detected in the virus-infected cell extracts at 5 or 438 10 hpi (Fig. 3E). Enzymatic de-phosphorylation with \uf06c-Ppase and alkaline Calf 439 Intestinal Ppase (CIP), previously used to discriminate phosphorylated from non-440 phosphorylated NSP5 (19), further corroborated the observed lack of 441 NSP5/S67A phosphorylation (Fig. 3F). Because of the differences in the 442 molecular weight markers used, the NSP5 band with the fastest PAGE mobility 443 has been traditionally described as 26 kDa, and the most abundant one as 28 444 kDa. Since this nomenclature has been used in many publications, we have 445 preferred to maintain it, despite current PAGE migrations do not correspond to 446 the markers presently used. 447 We then generated two additional rRVs harbouring truncated versions of NSP5, 448 one lacking the 18 AA long C-terminal tail (rRV-NSP5/\uf044T), and the second one 449 with a 5 AA deletion (176-YKKKY-180) just upstream of the tail region (rRV-450 NSP5/\uf044176-180)(Table 1andFig. 1A-B). Despite the presence of Ser67, and 451 the lack of Thr and Ser residues within the deletions, both mutants did not show 452 a classical hyperphosphorylation pattern(Fig. 4A) and failed to replicate, 453 confirmed by the absence of de novo synthesis of genomic dsRNA(Fig. 4B). 454We also investigated viroplasm formation in cells infected with these rRV 455 mutants. At early infection (5 hpi), the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant produced 456 structures resembling viroplasms that appeared smaller and more 457 heterogeneous in shape compared to the regular, spherical ones produced 458 during the wt rRV infection(Fig. 5A upper panel and Fig. 5B). Remarkably, 459 during late infection (10-12 hpi), the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant produced multiple 460 NSP5-containing aberrant structures, as well as fibre-like structures that became 461 more apparent during late infection (12 hpi)(Fig. 5A lower panel and Fig. 5B).",

Interestingly, these mutants yielded fibre-like structures 474 containing only VP6 protein (Fig. 5E-F). Similar VP6-fibres are normally formed 475 when VP6 is over-expressed in cells in the absence of other viral proteins (35, 476 36). 477 Taken together, these results confirm the role of NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation for 478 controlling the assembly of regular-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role 479 of the C-terminal tail in the formation of RV viral factories. 480 481 RNA accumulation in aberrant structures 482 Having examined the viral protein composition of the aberrant viroplasms formed 483 during infection with rRVs exhibiting impaired NSP5 phosphorylation, we then 484 assessed their RNA content.

As expected, most viral transcripts localised in 488 viroplasms of rRV-wt infected cells (Fig. 6A), consistent with the roles of 489 viroplasms in supporting the viral replication and assembly.

For this purpose, we used single molecule RNA 499 fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) to identify the sites of RV 500 transcription. At 10 hpi, abundant gs6 transcripts could be detected in all 501 viroplasms identified in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells infected with the rRV-wt(Fig. 6B). 502Conversely, the rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected cells had sparse EGFP-tagged 503structures, but less than 20% of them contain gs6 RNA(Fig. 6B-C). Interestingly, 504 the less frequently occurring rod-like aberrant structures also showed gs6 RNA 505 accumulation, further suggesting that these structures could represent 506 replication-functional organelles. 507In contrast, smFISH performed on cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/\uf044T showed 508 diffuse distribution of gs6 RNA that did not localise to any structures resembling 509 viroplasms(Fig. 6B), also failing to support the virus genome replication(Fig. 510 4B). 511We then examined the ultrastructures of viroplasms with altered morphologies in 512 the RV mutant rRV-NSP5/S67A using electron microscopy. Upon infection with 513 rRV-wt(Fig. 7A, left panel), multiple membrane-less electron dense inclusions 514 encircled by the well-defined endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) filled with triple-515 layered particles were present in cells. At late infection points (10 hpi), filled with 516 triple-layered particles (TLPs) ER appeared to adopt a more tubular morphology, 517 suggesting a successive step in the virus egress. In contrast, the rRV-518 NSP5/S67A-infected cells contained only few immature viroplasms that lacked 519 the ER network filled with TLPs(Fig. 7A, right panel).

As shown in Fig. 8B (lanes 5-6) NSP5/S67A 562 was hyper-phosphorylated in presence of NSP5/\u22063 mutant and confirmed by the 563 \uf06cPpase treatment (Fig. 8D), although it did not completely rescue the 564 phosphorylation pattern of NSP5 normally observed in rRV-wt infection. When 565 loading large amounts of NSP5/S67A, we have occasionally observed a second 566 faint band with reduced mobility, as in Fig. 8B, lane 2 (indicated with *). 567Interestingly, regular round-shaped structures resembling viroplasms, containing 568 NSP5, NSP2 and VP2 with peripheral localisation of VP6, were recovered in 569 these cells infected with rRV-NSP5/S67A, and yet viral replication was 570 nevertheless impaired(Fig. 8E-F).

In order to 609 characterise replication-deficient NSP5-negative mutants, we have established a 610 trans-complementing system that provides NSP5 to the virus both transiently in 611 BHK-T7 cells, and stably in NSP5-producing MA104 cell line (MA-NSP5), thus 612 enabling facile isolation of rRVs lacking functional NSP5. Using this approach, 613we have demonstrated that NSP5-deficient rRV was unable to form viroplasms 614 -phosphorylation has been previously implicated in the regulation of 621 NSP5 assembly into viroplasms. This phosphorylation, however, requires the 622 interaction of NSP5 with, either NSP2 or VP2, as NSP5 is not phosphorylated623 when expressed alone (8, 22, 23). Previous studies suggest that activation of 624 NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation may require a conformational change that leads to 625 its efficient hyper-phosphorylation via a positive feedback loop mechanism (8, 23, 626 24). Two regions comprising the N-terminal amino acids 1-33 (region 1) and the 627 central region amino acids 81-130 (region 3) have been reported to prevent 628 NSP5 phosphorylation in the absence of other viral proteins, while the 18 amino 629 acids long C-terminal tail was found to be essential for its phosphorylation (8, 23, 630 24). 631 Here, we have shown that all three rRV mutants S67A, \uf044T and \uf044176-180 632 expressing the phosphorylation-negative NSP5 variants were unable to form 633 round-shaped viroplasms upon infection of MA104 cells. Interestingly, further 634 analysis of these mutants reveals some key differences between each NSP5 635 variant. While rRV-NSP5/S67A strain formed aberrant structures resembling 636 viroplasms that poorly support RV replication, this variant was still capable of 637 producing the infectious progeny, in contrast to the two other rRV mutant strains. 638 Interestingly, the phenotype observed with the NSP5 mutant S67A was 639 essentially the same as the one previously reported with the wt virus infecting 640 MA104 cells silenced for expression of CK1\uf061, which is involved in 641 phosphorylating Ser67 and initiating the hyper-phosphorylation cascade (24, 25).642It has recently been shown that CK1\uf061 is also involved in phosphorylating NSP2, 643controlling the formation of rotavirus viral factories (39). Our data obtained with 644 the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant strongly suggest that the lack of NSP5 hyper-both the morphogenesis of viroplasms and their 646 capacity to support RV genome replication. We cannot rule out the role of NSP2 647 phosphorylation in assembly of viroplasms since NSP2 is also likely to be the formation of aberrant structures resembling viroplasms, the amount of RNA 650 produced within those structures in rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected MA104 cells was 651 practically below the detection limit of the 5-EU labelling, while the RNA 652 replication was fully rescued in the trans-complementing MA-NSP5 cell line(Fig. 653 5). It is unlikely that the viral mRNAs produced in MA104 wt cells infected with 654the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain was degraded faster, as most of the ssRNA 655 synthesised is a consequence of the secondary round of transcription from the 656 newly made dsRNA-containing particles. Indeed, very low amounts of dsRNA 657 were detected during the infection of MA104 cells. smFISH results confirmed the 658 presence of small amounts of RV (+)ssRNA in some of these aberrant structures. 659 This result is consistent with the finding that the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain did 660 replicate, albeit at much lower levels than the rRV-wt. Thus, these structures are 661 likely to sustain virus replication with decreased efficiency, which was further 662 confirmed by the electron microscopy analysis of MA104 cells infected with the 663 rRV-NSP5/S67A strain. 664 The important role of NSP5 hyper-phosphorylation was further supported by the 665 results obtained with the two phosphorylation-negative mutant strains NSP5/\u2206T 666 and NSP5/\u2206176-180 that possess Ser67 and yet failed to form viroplasms in 667 MA104 cells. Surprisingly, the \uf044176-180 mutant, containing the C-terminal tail 668 has also failed to form viroplasms in MA104 cells, despite the absence of Ser or 669 Thr within the chosen 176-180 region.

This finding strongly suggests that 679 impairment of NSP5 phosphorylation is the direct cause of the formation of the 680 aberrant structures in the cytosol of the infected cell. Despite the fact that these 681 structures appeared morphologically similar to the classical round-shaped 682 viroplasms in MA-\uf0443 cells, the presence of VP6 around these structures was only 683 observed with the hyperphosphorylated NSP5/S67A mutant, in contrast to the 684 other NSP5 phosphorylation-negative mutants. One possibility is that, during RV 685 infection, accumulation of VP6 in round-shaped viroplasms requires a full-length 686 hyperphosphorylated NSP5, as well as phosphorylation of multiple serine 687 residues likely by CK2 (17, 26). Moreover, the round-shaped structures found in 688 MA-\u22063 cells infected with rRV-NSP5/KO failed to contain VP6. 689 The observed failure to rescue the replication of the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain to the 690 wt levels in MA-\u22063 cells could be the consequence of the incomplete recovery of 691 the complex pattern of phosphorylated isoforms of wt NSP5. This suggests that 692 some intermediate isoforms might be important for the formation of fully 693 functional replication-competent viroplasms. 694We propose a model of the complex hierarchical mechanism of NSP5 hyper-695 phosphorylation during RV infection(Fig. 11). It involves (a) interaction of NSP5 696 with either NSP2 or VP2, required to (b) make Ser67 available for CK1\uf061 697 phosphorylation. This initial step is then sequentially completed (c) by CK2-698 mediated phosphorylation of other serines to generate the NSP5 'activator', 699 during a step dependent (d) on the interaction of the Ser67-phosphorylated 700 molecules with the non-phosphorylated partners in the NSP5 oligomeric 701 complexes. Alternatively (c'), oligomers could be formed before the activation 702 step. NSP5 interactions mediated by the carboxy-terminal tails T result in (e) 703 substrate activation and a fully hyperphosphorylated NSP5. This process leads to 704 (f) the assembly of viroplasms scaffolds containing NSP2, and (g) recruitment of 705 VP6, as well as the other viroplasmic proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 to assemble 706 replication-competent viroplasms.",

After 4-8 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 325chamber, samples were briefly rinsed with the wash buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 326 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 10 % v/v formamide in nuclease-free water), after 327 which a fresh aliquot of 300 \u00b5l of the wash buffer was applied to each sample 328 and incubated twice at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. After 2 washes, nuclei were briefly 329 stained with 300 nM DAPI solution in 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate, pH 330 7.0, and the samples were finally rinsed with and stored in the same buffer 331 without DAPI prior to imaging.332 Transmission electron microscopy. MA104 cells were seeded at 1x10 5 cells in 334 2 cm 2 wells onto sapphire discs and infected at MOI of 75 FFU/cell. At 10 hpi, 335 cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM Na/K phosphate buffer, pH 336 7.4 for 1 h at 4\u02daC and kept in that buffer overnight at 4\u02daC. Afterward, samples 337 were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mM Na/K phosphate buffer for 338 1h at 4\u02daC and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series starting at 70%, followed by 339 two changes in acetone, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections (60 to 80 nm) 340 \uf06c-Protein phosphatase and Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase Assays 346 Cellular extracts were incubated with 2,000 units of \uf06c-protein phosphatase (\uf06c-347 DTT, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mM MnCl2. The mixture was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2 h. 349 Samples were loaded in SDS-PAGE and analysed by Western blotting. For the Calf Intestinal Alkaline Ppase (CIP) assay, cellular extracts were 351 incubated with 1,000 units of CIP (New England Biolabs) in CutSmart\u2122 reaction 352 buffer (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 2h. Samples were 353 subjected to SDS-PAGE and analysed by Western blotting. 354 Electrophoresis of Viral dsRNA Genomes. 356 Cells were infected with the recombinant viruses at MOI of 5 and were lysed 16 357 hours post infection. Total RNA was extracted from lysed cells with RnaZol \u00ae 358 (Sigma-Aldrich) according the manufacturer's protocol and the dsRNA segments 359 were resolved on 10% (wt/vol) poly-acrylamide gels (PAGE) for 2 hours at 180 360 Volts and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (1\uf06dg/ml). 361 Proteins derived from rRVs-infected cellular extract were separated on an SDS-364 PAGE for 2 hours at 35 mA and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride 365 membranes (Millipore; IPVH00010) for 1 hour and 30 minutes at 300 mA (24).

Two essential additional modifications 386 were introduced to trans-complement the potential loss of NSP5 function in the 387 rRV mutants: i) an additional T7-driven plasmid encoding the ORF of wt NSP5 388 (i.e., without gs11 5' and 3' UTRs) was included in the transfection step of BHK-389 T7 cells; and ii) each rescued rRV was amplified in a stable transfectant cell line 390 MA-NSP5, supplying the wt NSP5 in trans. Crucially, we have successfully 391 established a novel MA-NSP5 cell line to support the replication of NSP5-392 deficient recombinant viruses to enable their further in-depth characterisation.Both steps (i) and (ii) were absolutely required for rescuing the NSP5 KO virus, 394confirming the essential role of NSP5 for RV replication. These mutants, as well 395 as additional stable cell lines generated for this study as described in Materials 396 NSP5 expression and localisation to viroplasms in virus-infected cells have been 400",
