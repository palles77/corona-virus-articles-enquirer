Study design: Analysis of Prospective surveillance data for Beijing collected during the outbreak. Methods: Surveillance data were reclassified according to World Health Organization criteria. Cases previously excluded without date of onset of illness were included in the epidemic curve from estimates using the average time between date of onset and date of hospitalization for cases with both dates. Cases who failed to give a contact history were now included; 7% (n \u00bc 5) of cases during the import phase and 61% (n \u00bc 365) during the peak phase. Previously excluded cases were included for plotting on an epidemic curve, and basic spot mapping for distribution of cases was used from attack rates recalculated for age, gender, occupation, residential location, date of onset of illness and demographics. Results: The spot map effectively illustrated clusters by residency, with the innercity sustaining the highest attack rate (33.42 per 100,000), followed by an easterly distribution 5-30 km away (21.62 per 10,000), and lowest in districts 60-160 km away (9.21 per 100,000). The new epidemic curve shows the outbreak commencing 10 days earlier than initially reported, with a three-fold greater increase in cases during the escalation phase than previously estimated. Conclusion: In hindsight, the investigation of the Beijing SARS would have benefited from the use of spot maping as an essential outbreak tool for early identification of specific geographical area(s) for quarantining.

Retrospective examination of reports from the three regions in China most affected, Beijing, 4 Guangdong 2 and Hong Kong-SAR, 3 suggested regional deficiencies in epidemiological data. Post-epidemic analysis using spatial diffusion process provides a powerful understanding of the geographic relationship between populations and their environment. 5 However, it does not provide preliminary assistance that would identify potential hot spots of exposure as the outbreak unfolds. We carried out simple re-analysis of the Beijing data to determine which data could have provided information that would have resulting in early containment.",

During the early phase (import and escalation phases) of the outbreak, case definition was in accordance with the Ministry of Health criteria 6 in the absence of World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and a serology test. Re-analysis, therefore, also included cases initially excluded if they did not fulfil the Ministry of Health diagnostic criteria of SARS 6 requiring cases with contact history of either direct case contact or contact with an endemic area. These cases were now reclassified according to WHO criteria, 7 with cases classified as 'probable' cases only where their signs and symptoms were in accordance with criteria for one of three WHO definitions for 'probable' SARS. All 5327 cases available from the SARS epidemic database, collated by the Disease Control and Prevention Centre, Beijing, 6 were now included in the epidemic curve. Cases were categorized into 15 occupational groups, with restaurants combined with hospitality services and the military and police services combined. 8 Re-analysis included an epidemic curve for 'probable' SARS cases only and calculations of the Beijing population-based rate, stratified by age and sex, using the Fifth General Census of China (version 2000). The original analysis did not include a spot map. Re-analysis included cases plotted for 18 geographic areas with rates calculated per 100,000 residents and then regrouped into three geographic areas according to distance from the city centre: inner city, 5-10 km, and more than 10 km from the inner city. Denominator data were not available to calculate specific exposure rates, such as number of hospitalized patients for a healthcare-acquired infection rate, number of healthcare workers for an occupationally acquired rate or healthcare worker hours for occupationally acquired rate per hours of exposure. The epidemiologic curves were developed using Microsoft Excel 2000, and SPSS version 10 was used to calculate case fatality rates (CFR), odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals for proportions, rates, odds and rates, and tests for significance.",

Our analysis for spot mapping clearly illustrates that the highest attack rate was sustained by residents living in a most densely populated area, within 30 km of the city centre, concurring with the post-epidemic sophisticated analysis of spatial diffusion process. 5 During the 89day epidemic, similar durations were experienced elsewhere in China; 10,11 although our database could not identify community-acquired from occupationally acquired risk, an early spot map would have identified clustering of cases, indicating a likely community exposure. The decline in contact history should have raised suspicion that the definition of 'contact' in the initial phase could have benefited from a re-definition throughout the epidemic. Contact history during an outbreak involving progressive transmission should list exposure to animals, environmental contact (i.e. a hospital or geographic contact by virtue of residential location), as potential contacts. Such redefining, along with spot maps for place of residency or occupation, would have still revealed the heavy case loads in the inner city areas. Although this is not always suggestive of a causative agent, it would be strongly supportive of the usefulness of geographical quarantining. Even though more contacts acquired SARS from spouses (15.4%), the proportion was greater with non-household contact (11.6%) 12 than household contact (8.8%), or friend (10.0%), suggesting that environmental exposure is a causal factor and supported by the clustering on our spot map and the high attack rate in those of working age. Daily commuting to work across densely populated cities assists the dissemination of airborne or droplet spread diseases even when infectivity may be low. 13 Excellent control measures were instigated during the early phase, including quarantining contacts and closing public social and education venues. 12 However, basic spot mapping could support a policy for rapid and severe restriction of population movement within 30 km circumference from the city centre.",

As a result, during the first 24 days into the epidemic, the magnitude was under-estimated by close to onethird by excluding cases without contact history or date of onset of illness. This resulted in a delay of 10 days in which an epidemic could have been recognized for containment. With any outbreak of unknown origin, there will be a paucity of crucial epidemiological data, including the significance of asymptomatic infection, an accurate incubation period, the infectivity and likelihood of person-toperson spread and changes in clinical presentation. The rapid decline in reports of contact history should strongly suggest that strict application of a current case definition could under-estimate the magnitude of the epidemic and efficacy of interventions. To fulfil the criteria of 'contact history', such contact would have had to occur between 1 and 16 days previously. 14 The dramatic decline in contact history may be caused by: (1) failure by healthcare workers to elicit contact history;",

For management of future possible airborne outbreaks, we would recommend the development of a colour-coded public warning system, similar to the three tiered numerical typhoon warning system. 'Yellow' warning would be given to the public to heed specific hygiene practices, reduce public gathering (cinema, dining out etc.), or both, with the understanding that this level could be a false-alarm or upgraded to 'orange', indicating further cases fulfilling a firmer case definition, finishing with 'red' to indicate a definite outbreak. All levels could be down-graded or up-graded with continuous analysis of data. Containment of an outbreak requires interpretation of data analysis using the three public health tenets, 'time, place and person'. These analyses carried out early may be flawed; however epidemiologists must be able to issue early warning with support from both government and non-government bodies and withstand pressure from economic lobby groups when warnings are false alarms or require geographic quarantining.",
