Comparing the number of syncytia at 11 hr with the number of infected cells observed in the sample without an underlying lawn indicated that nearly every infected cell was able to form a syncytium. These results showed that virus transmission was efficient by this route and suggested that virus infected the underlying monolayer via cell-to-cell spread and not via free virus. When BHK or RK13 cells were similarly overlaid with infected DBT cells, small syncytia were apparent by 11 hr p.i. (data not shown) and were more substantial by 22 hr p.i. (Figs. 1 C and 1 E). BHK cells were more susceptible to syncytium formation than were RK13 cells as indicated both by the larger size of the individual syncytium and by the higher ratio of syncytia to single cells.

The MHV-JHM which we used synthesizes little or no HE protein ( ( 14) T.G., unpublished observation), making it unlikely that this protein was responsible for our results. However, two approaches were taken to prove directly that receptor-independent spread was S-mediated. First, syncytium formation was inhibited in DBT, BHK, and RK13 cells if either of two different anti-S monoclonal antibodies (5B19.2 and 5A13.5 (9)) was added to the cell supernatant (data not shown). Second, others have shown that the S protein was capable of initiating syncytium formation in the absence of expression of other MHV proteins (10, 7 I). This was confirmed by dually infecting DBT cells with recombinant VV expressing T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7.3) (16) and a second VV encoding the MHV-JHM S glycoprotein (vTF7.3/S) (17, 78). These cells were extensively washed and seeded onto uninfected lawns of BHK and RK13 cells. As before, the number of infected cells observed in a sample without underlying cells was very similar to the number of syncytia noted on the BHK and RK13 lawns, suggesting spread from the DBT-infected cells. Syncytia were larger and formed earlier when the seeded cells were infected with vTF7.3/S than when these cells were infected with MHV. These results probably reflected a Note. Plates (10 cm') containing no ceils (\"none\") as well as those containing confluent DBT, BHK, and RK13 cells monolayers were overlaid with MHV-JHM-infected DBT cells as described in Fig. 1 . After 22 hr, cells were disrupted by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and virus titered on DBT indicator cells. In each experiment, two to six individual wells were harvested and each sample was titered in duplicate. NT, not tested.",

BHK cells (50-60% confluent) in lo-cm2 wells were transfected with CMV-8 @ galactosidase under the control of the human CMV major immediate-early promoter and enhancer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.)) using lipofectin (Bethesda Research Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's specifications.

After 6-8 hr, cells were assayed for viral antigen as described in Fig. 1 . Cells dually stained for B galactosidase and viral antigen were detected by sequential light and fluorescent microscopy. These results show that virus can spread to cultured cells lacking specific viral receptors and suggest that virus may also spread within infected animals by a receptor-independent mechanism. One case where this might be prominent is in MHV infections of relatively resistant hosts such as rats and monkeys.

Recently, it has been shown that cells expressing no HIV proteins but the fusogenic gp41 transmembrane protein could initiate syncytium formation in cells normally resistant to HIV, consistent with this model (30). Although this mechanism does not depend on the presence of a high-affinity cellular receptor, it may still require cell-cell contact via adhesion molecules or binding to a specific, ubiquitous cell surface protein or sugar epitope.",

Many SSPE variants have alterations or deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of the fusion (F) protein (3 I). This part of the F protein is believed to interact with the matrix (M) protein and its loss may facilitate lateral movement of the protein, with increased fusogenicity. Similarly, some variants of HIV-2 with increased ability to fuse uninfected tissue culture cells have env proteins deleted in their cytoplasmic domains (32). The role of these changes which increase fusogenicity in facilitating receptor-independent spread is not known at present, although by analogy with our results, such changes would make it more likely that this mechanism would occur.",
