The guidelines also fail to recommend the use of disinfecting products with specific claims relating to influenza virus that have been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Agency.",

            "text": "In 1996, the Australian Government through the gazetting of Therapeutic Goods Order Number 54, 1996 (as amended), introduced a range of controls over the disinfectant market in Australia. During the following year, all states of the Commonwealth formally ceded their powers in this area to the Australian Government. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) administers the regulatory scheme, which was augmented in 2002 with the Medical Devices Regulations (2002) to cover not just the higher risk products under a uniform international scheme, but also to bring under control even the cleaning products intended for use within healthcare. The TGA, through a range of instruments, also controls the label claims of all products in this category, and for any of the products intended for use exclusively within healthcare, this is a pre-market scheme. In practice, this means that any therapeutic claims (such as efficacy in disinfection of, for example, influenza virus) are required to be approved by the TGA, and that in order to gain TGA approval, the manufacturer is required to submit fully validated test data for review. It is therefore particularly strange that the Australian Guidelines for Infection Control within the context of an influenza pandemic 1 do not even mention the TGA as the regulator of therapeutic goods. The recommendations contained within these guidelines for surface disinfection focus generically on alcohol and chlorine as active materials. There are four areas of concern over the recommendations as they are currently framed. The affirmation of these guidelines by distinguished authors 2 lends weight to the opinions expressed within the guidelines, but fails to address the legal requirements of the Therapeutic Goods Act or allow for a hierarchy of control so important in managing risk, and particularly risk in occupational safety. 3 First, there is the equity problem of unqualified recommendation of products by brand name within the official interim guidelines where the opportunity of consideration of legal alternatives is not provided. The products named are chlorine-based disinfectants without any specific approved claims (e.g. for killing of the influenza virus on surfaces). The most galling situation is the specific recommendations superimposed, wherein information is provided by the guidelines which if repeated by the companies involved would be strictly illegal under the Therapeutic Good Act 1989. These guidelines as they stand are very good for the company named, but deny equity to all other companies, even when some other companies have products registered and accepted to kill influenza virus, information that the named products do not have on their official labels.",

In the case of liquid chlorine, the actual disinfectant solution will be prepared by dilution of a significantly higher concentration solution. Such solutions are highly corrosive and classifiable as both a hazardous substance and a dangerous good under Australian Occupational Health and Safety regulations. Sodium hypochlorite solutions are also notoriously unstable with respect to loss of active chlorine, and therefore a means of analysing for active chlorine is essential to ensure a correct working dilution.",

There is therefore a workplace requirement 5 to segregate this material from certain other dangerous goods (e.g. class 3 flammable liquids such as alcohol).

During a pandemic, the need for surface disinfection is not limited to clinical areas. For example, a patient waiting room will be a mixed environment with fabrics, carpet, magazines, chairs and other objects that may become contaminated by droplets or fomites from a coughing and sneezing viremic patient. The use of chlorine-based disinfectants may also affect safety measures such as the fire resistance of upholstery. 6 Clearly, the inexpensive option of a chlorine-based solution will be likely to lead to damage that far outweighs the initial cost of purchase. This is so unnecessary when there are products registered to kill influenza virus on surfaces, which are not corrosive, are non-staining and are safe to use when used as directed on the approved label.",
