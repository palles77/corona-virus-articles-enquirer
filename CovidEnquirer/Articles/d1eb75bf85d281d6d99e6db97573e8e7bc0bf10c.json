The earliest recorded successful grafting procedures were autografts in which skin or bone was recovered from one site on a patient's body and then grafted in a different location on the same individual. 1 Autografting procedures were described more than 2,600 years ago in the Sanskrit texts of ancient India. 1 These surgeries to repair facial mutilations involved the use of pedicle flaps from the cheek or forehead as a source for nasal reconstruction. 1 Even today, autografts usually are considered the gold standard in grafting material because of their extremely low risk of disease transmission and graft rejection and their superior ability to incorporate into the body. 2, 3 Increasingly, surgeons are choosing to use allografts (ie, tissues recovered from one individual and transplanted into another). 4 In contrast to autografts, donated allografts can \u2022 provide surgeons with a greater supply of grafting material than can be provided by the surgical patient;",

Possible transmission of CJD through corneas and eye tissue was also reported. . . . 8(p2) These and other infections (eg, endocarditis, septic arthritis) demonstrated that inadequate precautions were being taken in donor selection. In October 1993, a Congressional subcommittee heard concerned testimony from representatives of the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) about questionable practices that were occurring in some tissue banks not accredited by AATB. 23 The resulting federal investigations confirmed . . . that human tissues from foreign sources were being offered for sale in the United States with little documentation as to the source of the human tissue, cause of death, medical conditions of the donor, or results of donor screening and testing. 23 With these revelations and deep concerns for public health safety, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued its first ruling in regulation of the tissue banking industry on Dec 14, 1993. 24 The first rule for human tissues intended for transplantation established donor medical and behavioral suitability requirements. In an effort to prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis B and C, specific minimum serology tests became mandatory.

The explanation given was that because additional costs are associated with maintaining higher quality standards, and because there is no explicit patient demand for higher quality standards to prevent contamination risks, some facilities are not currently following adequate quality control standards. 26(p1539) On July 15, 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) informed the FDA that it had received 54 reports of allograft-associated infections. 8(p3) Considering that at the time, infectious disease transmission by human tissue was not even routinely reported, it was apparent that something had to change.

In general, hospitals are directed to formulate standard policies and assign specific responsibility for the oversight of all facets of their tissue program, including tissue ordering, receipt, storage, issuance activity, and record keeping. Hospitals also must validate that all facilities or individuals who supply tissues are licensed properly by state agencies and/or registered as a tissue establishment with the FDA. 28 RECORD KEEPING. Precise record keeping is very important. When the hospital receives a graft, the graft's unique identification number should be documented in a log along with a description of the graft and its expiration date. The log then should be updated to show implantation data (ie, surgeon, date, graft recipient). The unique graft identification number and description of the graft also must be placed in the recipient's medical record. Even if the graft is never implanted, the log must be amended to show the final disposition of the graft (eg, discarded due to expiration or contamination). Hospitals must promptly report implantation information to the tissue provider. Even if the graft is never implanted, its final disposition still must be reported to the provider of the graft. 28 All hospital records relating to the implantation or other final disposition of tissue grafts must be maintained a minimum of 10 years or longer if required by state or federal laws after the date of distribution, transplantation, other disposition, or expiration, whichever is latest. These record retention mandates are to ensure that grafts can be traced from donor to recipient and from recipient to donor if report-ing of disease transmission or infection becomes necessary. 28 Additionally, all policy and procedure manuals and hospital publications relating to allograft tissues must be kept for 10 years. 28 STORAGE AND HANDLING OF GRAFTS. To ensure safety and effectiveness, tissue grafts must be handled, stored, and transported according to the tissue provider's written directions. Grafts must be documented to have arrived at the hospital at the proper temperature with packaging intact and with all appropriate paperwork. The paperwork should include a means for reporting use of the graft, as well as instructions for graft storage and preparation for implantation. 28 The grafts must be stored under controlled access and at the proper temperatures (Table 1) . Daily temperature charts must be maintained even for those grafts intended to be stored at ambient room temperature (ie, freezedried grafts.) For grafts intended to be stored in refrigerators or freezers, 24hour, seven-day-a-week temperature monitoring must be maintained and documented. Tissue storage records should document that refrigerated grafts are maintained at a certain temperature. 29 All temperature records must be kept a minimum of 10 years or longer if required by state and/or federal laws after the date of distribution, transplantation, other disposition, or expiration, whichever is latest.",

More than 3,300 medical group practices nationwide participated in the study.Only 14% of all medical group practices that participated in the study use an EHR, and fewer than 12% indicated that an EHR has been fully implemented for all physicians and at all practice locations. The study found that the adoption rate increased with the size of the practice. For example, \u2022 fewer than 13% of medical group practices with five or fewer full-time-equivalent (FTE) physicians have adopted an EHR, \u2022 approximately 15% of groups with six to 10 FTE physicians have adopted an EHR, \u2022 nearly 19% of groups with 11 to 20 FTE physicians have adopted an EHR, and \u2022 nearly 20% of groups with 20 or more FTE physicians have adopted an EHR.Other data show that \u2022 nearly 13% of groups were in the process of implementing an EHR at the time of the study, \u2022 approximately 14% planned to implement an EHR within the next year, \u2022 nearly 20% planned to implement an EHR within 13 to 24 months, and \u2022 approximately 42% have no immediate plans for EHR implementation. Although some practices report important efficiency gains from their EHRs, there is widespread dissatisfaction with the design and performance of these technologies. Researchers noted that an important barrier to adoption is that practices are not convinced that EHRs will improve their performance, and the return on investment in terms of cost and quality are not yet evident.
