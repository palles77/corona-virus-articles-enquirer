Characteristics such as a short gestation and a relatively short life span, a docile behavior, and ready availability of animals with welldefined health and genetic backgrounds are responsible for the importance of the rat as a laboratory animal. The rat is a standard species for toxicological, teratological, and carcinogenesis testing by the pharmaceutical industry and governmental agencies. Its early use in behavioral, neurological, nutritional, and endocrinology studies continues today. The size of the rat enables it to be used for surgical procedures, varying from organ transplantation to vascular techniques. Although the number of commonly used inbred strains is dwarfed by those of the mouse, inbred rat strains do represent an important repertoire of disease models (Table I) .",

Wall, ceiling, and floor surfaces should be made of materials that allow for effective sanitation and that are resistant to damage from normal use and manipulation of equipment. The environment of the room should be well controlled, to ensure animal well-being and to help limit variables to those of the experimental design. Although rats, like most other species, can adapt to changes in temperature and humidity, room temperatures within a range of 700-76 ~ F and with a relative humidity of 30-70% are typically accepted as being appropriate. Twenty-four-hour temperature/ humidity recorders, either located in animal rooms or as a component of an electronic environmental management system, are useful in detecting changes in environmental conditions. Practice over many years has shown that, in general, ventilation rates of 10-15 air changes/hr of fresh air are sufficient to compensate for heat load and the generation of NH3 and CO2 from animals. A stable photoperiod is necessary to avoid changes in reproductive behavior, food intake, and weight gain. A cycle of 12 to 14 hr light and 10 to 12 hr dark is typically used for rats. Rats are particularly susceptible to phototoxic retinopathy. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that light intensity at cage level should be between 130 and 300 lux to prevent retinopathy (National Research Council, 1996a,b) .",

Strategies for limiting the transfer of pathogens will vary according to the potential impact that infectious agents may have on a particular group of rats and the study in which they are being used. For instance, an appropriate-sized room or cubicle may reflect the space necessary to separate rats by such criteria as pathogen status, immunological status, vendor, protocol, or investigator. Modifications such as the incorporation of Class 100 flexible wall enclosures may be useful to help ensure the specific pathogen status of rats over an extended period of time. Because of stress produced by noise, rat rooms should be located distant from mechanical rooms, cage washing centers, and species that are apt to produce noise (National Research Council, 1996b).",

This will help prevent pododermatitis and injuries that are more frequently associated with wire floors (National Research Council, 1996b) , and bedding within solidbottom cages provides environmental enrichment. The most frequently used materials for solid-bottom cages are polycarbonate and polypropylene. The former plastic is often preferred because it may be repeatedly autoclaved without damage and because its translucency allows for observation of animals. Various contact bedding materials are appropriate for rats (e.g., hardwood chips, ground corncob, cellulose sheets).",

Accordingly, a reddish secretion or crust located periorbitally and at the nares may be a useful indicator of illness or a husbandry problem (Moore, 1995) . The orbital venous sinus beneath the medial aspect of the orbit is a useful site for blood collection in the anesthetized animal.

However, the refinement of ingredients within diet formulations may vary according to classifications of commercially available products. The three classifications of diets are (1) natural-ingredient, (2) purified, and (3) chemically defined. The most commonly used type for most research applications is the natural-ingredient diet, composed of agricultural products and by-products. This class of diet can be either an open-formula diet, in which the information on the amount of each ingredient is available, or a closed-formula diet, in which such information is held confidential by the producer. The nutrient composition of ingredients in natural-ingredient diets varies from batch to batch because of various factors (e.g., relative costs of grains, weather conditions, harvesting and storage conditions, and concentrations of contaminants). Certified, natural-ingredient diets are used for toxicological and other Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies because each lot is assayed and certified not to exceed established maximum concentrations of a set list of contaminants (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and estrogens) that could influence study results.",

A frequently used purified diet for rats is AIN-76. The downside of this class of diets is that Baker (1979) and Bivin et al. (1979). they are more expensive and often less palatable. Chemically defined diets are formulated with very basically defined ingredients (e.g., specific amino acids, sugars, triglycerides, and essential fatty acids). These diets are costly and tend to lack palatability (National Research Council, 1996b) . Table V summarizes the nutrient requirements of rats (National Research Council, 1995) . In most instances, rats are fed ad libitum. However, there are numerous reports that demonstrate that unlimited feeding of rats on long-term carcinogenesis and toxicological studies reduces longevity and increases the incidence of neoplasia relative to rats fed at 70-80% of the ad libitum food amount. These effects have been found in Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, and F-344 rats and have caused increased variability among 2-year carcinogenicity and safety assessment studies, compromising the usefulness of bioassays in risk assessment (Keenan et al., 1996) . For instance, Wistar rats fed 80% of ad libitum beginning at 16 weeks of age had very significant reductions in the incidence of lung, mammary, pancreatic islet cell, and pituitary tumors relative to controls fed ad libitum. The overall incidence of malignant tumors was 16% in the feed-limited group and 37% in the ad libitum group, even though the feed-limited group had a greater longevity. There was also a reduction in chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the heart, acute inflammation of the prostate, radiculoneuropathy, and acinal hyperplasia of the mammary gland in feed-limited animals (Roe et al., 1995) .",

Rats in estrus often exhibit specific behavior, including ear quivering when the back or head are stroked, and lordosis (\"swayback\" posture) when the pelvic area is stimulated (Blandau et al., 1941) . Additionally, the vulva becomes swollen, and the vaginal wall appears dry in estrus, instead of the moist pink appearance during metestrus or diestrus. This is due to cornification of the vaginal epithelium during estrus (Baker, 1979) . These changes in the vaginal epithelium can be assessed by cytologic examination of vaginal smears (Montes and Luque, 1988) . In estrus, 25-100% of the epithelial cells are cornified (Bennett and Vickery, 1970) . Changes in vaginal fluids and cytology also lead to changes in the electrical impedance in the vagina during estrus. This has been widely exploited as a more precise method of estrus detection (Koto et al., 1987a, b) , using a device referred to as an impedance meter in which an electrical probe is inserted into the vagina.",

Wistar BH rats had an average of 1.69 more pups (11.80 vs. 10.11) when first mated at 105 days than when first mated at 35 days of age (Rosen et al., 1987) . The second litter is usually the largest (Bennett and Vickery, 1970) . After 9 months of age, litter size is further decreased, and the pregnancy rate declines after 12 months of age (Niggeschulze and Kast, 1994) . Loss of fetuses, termed pregnancy wastage, occurs as a function of age (Mattheij and Swarts, 1991) , with less than 5% wastage in 4-month-old rats, 30% in 9-month-old rats, and 65% at 11 months of age. Wastage is primarily due to preimplantation and early postimplantation mortality. In contrast to the decremental effects of aging on litter size, maternal behavior in virgin rats is enhanced at 19-20 months, when compared with those at 3-4 months of age (Gonzalez and Deis, 1990 ). In addition, at least some maternal stressors can lead to fetal wastage. An increase in fetal wastage was reported to be due to an earthquake that occurred when the dams were at 7, 8, or 9 days of gestation, although no difference was noted in the number of live births, fetal weight, or incidence of runts (Fujinaga et al., 1992) . This raises the possibility of similar fetal loss when rats are shipped at this stage of gestation, although such has not been documented in the peer-reviewed literature. Strenuous maternal exercise, i.e., running on a treadmill--has also been reported to result in decreased litter size and decreased fetal weight (Mottola et al., 1992) . Dystocia is rare in rats. Cannibalism is not frequently encountered and is an indicator of maternal stress.",

There is an inverse relationship between fetal or birth weight and litter size (Romero et al., 1992) . This phenomenon is significant for the reproductive toxicologist because the tendency of a test substance to cause decreased fetal weight may be masked if it also causes fetal loss. Other factors also influence birth weight and weaning weight, including the age of the dams. Pups of dams mated at 105 days of age weighed more at weaning than pups of dams mated at 35 or 70 days (Rosen et al., 1987) . The external acoustic meati open between 2.5 and 3.5 days of age. Internally, the cochlea and organ of Corti are immature at birth but develop rapidly to approximately adult morphology by the time of weaning. Rats appear to first be able to hear at about 9 days of age, although they are able to vocalize from the time of birth (Feldman, 1992) . Incisors erupt at 6-8 days of age, although molars do not erupt until 16 (molar 1), 18 (molar 2), and 32-34 days of age (molar 3) (Brown and Leininger, 1992) . The retina is poorly developed at birth, equivalent to a human fetus of 4-5 months. The eyelids open at about 14-17 days of age, although the retina does not fully mature until 30-40 days of age, and the final components in the angle of the anterior chamber are not fully formed until 60 days of age (Weisse, 1992) . Some hairs may be present on the trunk at birth, usually associated with touch domes, indicating that they are guard hairs (English and Munger, 1992) . Pups are considered fully haired at about 7-10 days of age. Maternal antibody is transferred passively across the yolk sac in utero (Laliberte et al., 1984) . Antibody can also be transferred across the intestinal mucosa from maternal colostrum and milk in the suckling rat. This transfer occurs at low rates shortly after birth, reaches maximal rates at day 14, and ceases by the 21 days, when gut closure is said to be complete (Martin et al., 1997) .",

These glands may be surgically removed without compromising fertility rates from AI. Alternatively, sperm may also be collected by stripping directly from the epididymis, although probably not more than twice from each male rat. Sperm from the proximal portion of the cauda epididymidis are reported to have greater fertility than sperm for the middle or caudal portions (Moore and Akhondi, 1996) . Once collected, sperm may be surgically introduced directly into the uterus of estrous females (Orihuela et al., 1999 ). An essential step in assuring the success of AI is the induction of pseudopregnancy in the recipient female by prior mating with a vasectomized male, by mechanical stimulation of the vagina, or by electrical stimulation of the cervix (Bennett and Vickery, 1970; Rouleau et al., 1993) .",

Embryo transfer can also be used to investigate whether specific characteristics are due to, or modified by, the uterine environment, in contrast to being solely determined by genetic factors (Kubisch and Gomez-Sanchez, 1999; Rouleau et al., 1993) . Additionally, embryo collection is the first step in cryopreservation. In embryo transfer, embryos are collected 2-4 days after the females are bred. Embryos are usually washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), with or without added trypsin. Trypsin may more effectively remove pathogens than PBS alone. Embryos are then suspended in PBS with BSA and fetal calf serum and surgically transferred into the uterus or oviduct of the pseudopregnant recipient (Kubisch and Gomez-Sanchez, 1999; Rouleau et al., 1993) . Nonsurgical implantation of embryos through the cervix, using an otoscope, has also been reported (Bennett and Vickery, 1970) but has not found wide use. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is performed in the rat but is used primarily as a research tool for events in fertilization and early development rather than as a colony management tool (Gaddum-Rosse et al., 1984; Vanderhyden et al., 1986) . One form of IVF, the microinjection of spermatids into individual oocytes, is, however, used in mice to rescue or maintain strains that do not produce motile spermatozoa (Tanemura et al., 1997; Songsasen and Leibo, 1998) . The same techniques will probably become more common in rats.",

Many aspects of the rat's normal behavior may affect scientific use of rats in biomedical research and should be investigated by researchers prior to initiating studies in those specific areas. Aspects of rat behavior relevant to experimental design and disease status may be considered in two broad and overlapping categories: normal behavior, and stressors and stress responses.

Sprague-Dawley rats, such as the CD and SD, and Lewis rats are generally more docile than Brown Norway or F-344 rats. Frequent gentle handling will increase docility, whereas infrequent or rough handling will evoke fear responses. Gentle handling not only reduces the likelihood of occupational injury for animal workers but also avoids stress for the rats. Handling-induced stress can lead to altered responses in behavioral studies (Hirsjarvi and Valiaho, 1995; Shalev et al., 1998) . Handling also leads to vocalization, much of which is ultrasonic, in the range of 22 kHz (Brudzynski et al., 1993; Brudzynski and Chiu, 1995; Brudzynski and Ociepa, 1992) . Stress-induced vocalization can make handling more difficult for other rats within hearing range. An additional interesting fact regarding rat vocalization, illustrative of its importance in rat behavior, is that rat pups vocalize in the ultrasonic range, probably to signal their mothers, even before their ears are sufficiently developed for them to be capable of hearing (Feldman, 1992) .",

Microscopic evaluation may reveal the characteristic irregularly branching arrays of gram-positive rods in tissue sections (Brown and Brenn stain) or impression smears (Gram stain). However, if possible, histopathology should always be confirmed by bacteriology. Disease provocation tests, often called stress tests, have also been employed to activate latent infections with C. kutscheri, as with Pneumocystis carinii and Clostridium piliforme. Adequate culture techniques should obviate the need for stress tests. Serology has also been widely employed for detection of C. kutscheri infection in immunocompetent rats (Fox et al., 1987) . As with other serologic assays, especially serologic assays for agents more antigenically complex than viruses, false positives and false negatives occasionally occur, so positive resuits should always be confirmed by culture.",

However, there is some doubt as to efficacy of stress tests that rely on chemical immunosuppression, usually with cyclophosphamide (Boivin et al., 1990) , followed by histopathologic evaluation.

Alternatively, sentinel animals can be placed on soiled bedding, but this may require sentinels to be of the same species (to avoid species specificity's causing false negatives), for not even gerbils are susceptible to all strains of C. piliforme (Motzel and Riley, 1992; Franklin et al., 1994) .",

The probability of successful elimination of P. pneumotropica by cesarean section can be further increased by culturing all uteri after the pups are removed and eliminating any offspring from a culture-positive uterus. Offspring should also be held in strict isolation--i.e., not mixed in with a breeding colony-until repeatedly cultured negative for P. pneumotropica. Pasteurella pneumotropica is not transmitted to a significant degree by fomites, does not persist or multiply in the environment, and only rarely colonizes humans. Therefore, once a colony is free of the agent, there is relatively little risk of reinfection except through introduction or incursion of infected animals.",

The taxonomic classification and subdivision of the genus are controversial and, like much taxonomy, subject to change (see Chapter 3). However, for clarity in communication, it is useful to refer to all salmonellas that one is likely to encounter in rats as belonging to S. enteritidis (Percy and Barthold, 1993a; Le Minor, 1984) . Salmonella enteritidis is composed of more than 2400 serovars. These vary greatly in pathogenicity and geographic distribution, which makes serovar classification of epizootiologic significance. However, this discussion will treat S. enteritidis as a single entity. Salmonellosis may be virtually nonexistent in laboratory rats in the United States, but because infection is thought to be prevalent among many other species of vertebrates, including wild rodents, the potential for introduction remains.",

In addition to these two coronavirus strains, there are others that have been isolated and found to differ antigenically from either RCV-P or RCV-SDA. Historically, RCV-P and RCV-SDA were considered to induce two rather distinct sets of clinical signs and types of lesions in rats (Jacoby et al., 1979) . More recently, however, the clinical signs, pathogenicity, and histological lesions are considered to be variable but similar for both RCV-P and RCV-SDA, and defining the neutralization group of a new RCV isolate is not useful in predicting its pathogenic potential (Compton et al., 1999) . Accordingly, infection with either RCV-SDA or RCV-P cannot be differentiated by comparison of clinical signs or lesions. The antigenic differences between RCV-P and RCV-SDA are significant enough to allow crossinfection with either virus. Probably the most important point to be made from a clinical perspective is that neutralizing antibodies to one virus prototype will not offer significant cross protection from the other virus strain, thus allowing viral shedding and recurrence of clinical signs and lesions, albeit diminished (Percy and Barthold, 1993b; Jacoby, 1986; Bihun and Percy, 1994; Kojima and Okaniwa, 1991; Weir et al., 1990) .",

Control of infection within a colony or facility is based upon the fact that rats shed the virus for only about 1 week, after which they are immune and not latently infected. The virus is not transmitted vertically. Eliminating rat coronavirus from a colony is achieved by allowing the virus to spread quickly to all animals, preventing entry of susceptible rats to the room, and suspension of breeding and removal of preweanlings. The rapidity in which all animals will seroconvert and no longer shed the virus will determine the period of time needed before susceptible animals can be safely introduced or breeding resumed. In most instances, a 6-to 8-week period should be allowed (Jacoby et al., 1979) . Alternatively, if suspension of breeding cannot be done, a method to continue breeding and eliminate SDA is to define a subset of the breeding colony that is seropositive and to relocate these breeding animals to a separate room, allow litters to be born in the original colony until the relocated breeders are in late gestation, and then kill all animals in the original colony (Brammer et al., 1993) .",

Rodents serve as the natural reservoirs for hantaviruses, with each virus in the genus being associated with a specific rodent species. Hantavirus infections in rodents are characterized by being chronic and subclinical, with virus being shed persistently in the feces and urine. Hantaviruses pose as significant zoonotic agents. Rattus norvegicus is the natural host for the Seoul Hantavirus, causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. Hantavirus has been isolated from wild rats in Baltimore and several other cities in the United States. One report cites evidence of human infection with a rat-associated Hantavirus (Childs et al., 1987) . Cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus, are reservoirs for a Hantavirus that has induced hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in individuals living in Florida (Hutchinson et al., 1998) . Transmission of Hantavirus from laboratory rats to laboratory personnel has been reported in Japan, Belgium, and the United Kingdom (Desmyter et al., 1983; Lloyd et al., 1984) . In both reports, multiple cases occurred that resulted in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.",

The lesions occur in 8-to 18-weekold animals with the most severe lesions seen at 8-12 weeks. Bacteriological culturing and PCR assays for Mycoplasma, CAR bacillus, and eubacteria genera suggest that the lesions are not associated with bacteria.

Giardia muris colonizes a wide variety of mammalian hosts, including rats, mice, hamsters, and humans (Levine, 1961) . Recent evidence has suggested that G. muris may actually be a form of G. duodenalis (Sharma and Mayrhofer, 1988b) . Although this conclusion seems to have implications for zoonotic potential, because G. duodenalis is a human pathogen, there does appear to be some host specificity, albeit incomplete. Giardia muris isolated from mice and hamsters, for example, did not produce infection when inoculated into rats (Kunstyr et al., 1992) . Trophozoites were previously reported to attach to the surface of intestinal epithelial cells by means of a flat suction disk (Levine, 1985a) . It is now thought that attachment is via a surface membrane mannose-binding lectin and can occur via any point on the parasite surface, without requiring the disk (Inge et al., 1988) .

The eggs have a distinct operculum, with a row of pores near the operculated end. The eggs hatch by a pneumatic mechanism in 5-6 days; the larvae ingest air through the pores, pass it through the body, and then use that pressure to force open the operculum (Owen, 1992b) . The young nymphs are paler than the yellow-brown adults but are morphologically similar. After three ecdyses, or molts, they become adults. Depending on environmental conditions, the ecdyses require 1-3 weeks. The entire life cycle is completed in 2-5 weeks. Adults live only 25-28 days. Transmission is by direct contact (Hsu, 1979) .",

This agent is latently present in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats and humans, causing pneumonitis in hosts that are severely immunosuppressed. The immunocompromised rat is commonly used as a model of P. carinii pneumonitis that occurs in AIDS patients (Oz and Hughes, 1996) . The agent is naturally acquired by rats through airborne transmission (Hughes, 1982) and is commonly present latently in rats from both conventional and barrier-maintained commercial sources. Diagnosis of infection in immunocompetent rats usually requires at least 6 weeks of treatment with a corticosteroid or cyclophosphamide to elicit a histologically detectable level of infection. Special stains such as methenamine silver demonstrate the fungal cysts within the alveoli. More recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to detect P. carinii infection in rat lungs consistently after only 1 week of treatment with corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide (Feldman et al., 1996) . Pneumocystis carinii has a life cycle consisting of four morphologically distinct stages: trophozoite (1.5-2 gm), precyst (2-4 gm), cyst (5-7 gm), and sporozoites (1-1.7 gm) that develop within cysts (National Research Council, 1991 a). Histopathology may vary from multifocal alveolar aggregates of cysts with interstitial and perivascular infiltrates in less severe cases to pulmonary consolidation with foamy, eosinophilic, honeycombed alveolar exudation and severe interstitial fibrosis (GV-SOLAS, 1999) . Control of the disease in immunocompromised rats can be achieved by treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Royals et al. (1999) reported 2 cases of fungal-induced rhinitis in rats that had no known immunosuppression. Corncob and hardwood bedding from 2 sources were tested to determine if the source of the Aspergillus infection was bedding material. A range of 700 to 5400 fungal spores per gram of nonautoclaved corncob bedding was found. Six genera of fungi (Cladosporidium, Acremonium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Scolobasidium) were isolated from the samples of corncob bedding, whereas only negligible counts were isolated from hardwood bedding samples. The authors suggested that either the use of autoclaved or 7-irradiated corncob bedding should be considered as a means to eliminate fungal contamination of bedding.",

More subtle strain-related tendencies, such as immunologic responsiveness characteristics in Brown Norway and Lewis rats, are exploited by researchers in particular areas of research. In recent years, genetic manipulation has allowed further development of specifically tailored metabolic disease to model critical human defects. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to catalog the innumerable genetic traits or strain-related variations that occur in laboratory rats, and the reader is encouraged to consult large electronic databases, such as the National Library of Medicine, for specific and current information on particular genes, strains, and conditions. In addition to known and characterized, spontaneous or induced, genetic variation in rats, isolated colonies of breeding rats inevitably experience some degree of genetic drift. Although this may be monitored to some degree in inbred rats by molecular techniques such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, it is more difficult to assess the degree to which it has occurred in outbred stocks, where expected interindividual variation may obscure intercolony differences. Nonetheless, any two colonies started from the same source will vary increasingly with time unless there is a sufficient and ongoing exchange of breeders between the colonies. Genetic drift can also be reduced by careful adherence to specific outbreeding programs, such as line breeding with systematic exchange of breeders between multiple lines.",

Second, rats store fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin B12, manufacture vitamin C, and can fulfill many of their requirements for other B vitamins by coprophagy. However, heat and moisture, such as are associated with autoclaving, can reduce vitamin levels, particular lysine, vitamin A, vitamin E, riboflavin, and thiamin. Prolonged storage can have similar effects. In addition, diets designed for maintenance of adult rodents may be too low in protein and fat for optimal growth of young animals or successful reproduction. Clinical evidence of dietary insufficiency may include decreased reproductive performance, litter loss, poor growth, and sparse hair coat. Signs of severe deficiencies of specific vitamins are rare. If they occur, they would include squamous metaplasia of salivary ducts with hypovitaminosis A, disseminated hemorrhage with hypovitaminosis K, and embryonic death and testicular degeneration with hypovitaminosis E.

Only a few of the most common will be mentioned. Sanitation of the animal's cage, bedding, water, and feed, as well as of experimental equipment, is critical. High moisture content in bedding leads to rapid growth of bacteria, which can increase the incidence of urinary tract infections and, possibly, mastitis and skin lesions. Some softwood bedding materials emit aromatic compounds that may increase hepatic microsomal levels, although these compounds are usually completely sublimated during the drying phase in bedding manufacture. Some organisms are airborne and can enter or spread within a facility via air currents. Considerations of air quality might also include factors such as ammonia, other bedding gases, dusts, fungal spores, disinfectant vapors, and pollutants. Management consideration must be given to organisms carried by human caretakers and investigators. Humans are commonly colonized by, and can transmit, Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Campylobacter spp., and so on. In addition, humans can transmit viruses that may result in serologic cross-reactions, if not outright infection, and can also serve as fomites for many other organisms.",

Rats, especially albino rats are susceptible to retinal degeneration when exposed to ambient light levels above a threshold of between 130 and 270 lux (Semple- Rowland and Dawson, 1987) . As a result, recommended room light levels are 325-400 lux (National Research Council, 1996b) . Note that these recommended levels are as measured 1 m above the floor and do not necessarily reflect actual light levels to which rats are exposed in individual cages at various levels in racks at varying distances from light fixtures. Exposure to very high light levels of 1600 lux for 12 hours each day for 8 days resulted in necrosis in Harderian glands (Kurisu et al., 1996) . In addition, exposure to constant light may cause anestrus and other breeding problems as described in Section II,D,3. Exposure (contamination) during the dark phase of the light cycle, with light levels as low as 0.21 lux, has been reported to interfere with growth and metabolism of tumors (Dauchy et al., 1997) .",

One of the authors (DK) has observed this most often when rats are allowed to recover from anesthesia in a wire-bottom cage.

Although it may be inherited as a single dominant gene in the Gunn rat, it appears to be polygenic in the Brown Norway and Sprague-Dawley rat (Van Winkle et al., 1988) . The right kidney is affected more often than the left. Severity of hydronephrosis can vary from a slight dilation of the renal pelvis to such severe dilation that the kidney appears as a transparent cystic structure. The ureter may also be affected to varying degrees. The normal renal pelvis of young animals may appear to be dilated, however, so some caution is required in identifying hydronephrosis (Maronpot, 1996) . Hydronephrosis may also be mistaken for pyelonephritis, in which the material in the dilated pelvis is typically cloudy; for polycystic kidneys; and for renal papillary necrosis. Culture and histopathology of the affected site will distinguish among these conditions. Congenital lesions of the cardiovascular system are less frequently reported but include ventricular and atrial septal defects, dextrocardia, and defects of the valves and endocardial cushion, as well as various anomalies of the great vessels. Overall incidence of cardiac defects has been estimated in one colony of Sprague-Dawley rats at 2.3% (Johnson et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "Chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN) is the most important age-related disease of rat kidneys and is among the most common causes of death in rats in lifetime studies. Synonyms abound, including chronic progressive nephrosis and old rat nephropathy. The condition is more common in males than in females and is progressive, as correctly indicated by its appellation. Gross lesions of CPN are first observed in rats more than 6 months of age and are characterized by pitting of the cortical surface. Because of cortical interstitial fibrosis, removal of the renal capsule may tear the cortical parenchyma. As it becomes more severe in rats more than 1 year of age, the cortical surface becomes increasingly irregular and may develop areas of pallor. Microscopically, glomerular changes are characterized by thickened basement membranes, thickening of the capillary tufts, adhesions to the parietal layer of Bowman's membrane, and segmental glomerulosclerosis (Short and Goldstein, 1992) . As the disease advances, numeroUs tubules in both the cortex and medulla are often dilated and filled with eosinophilic proteinaceous casts. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may occur subsequent to renal functional compromise in advanced cases, resulting in widespread dystrophic mineralization. The etiopathogenesis of CPN is poorly understood and is probably multifactorial. However, several of the major contributing factors have been described (Barthold, 1996b; Percy and Barthold, 1993b) . First, the reported incidence varies with strain. This indicates probably at least some genetic predisposition for the development of CPN. Sprague-Dawley and F-344 rats have high incidences, whereas Wistar and Long-Evans stocks have a lower incidence. Reported incidences, however, are difficult Ito interpret, because of geographic variation in use of different stocks and strains (Wistar rats have been used more predominantly in Europe, and Sprague-Dawley rats in the United States), which could lead to other factors, such as housing and diet, actually causing what otherwise appears to be a strainrelated change. For example, when many of the reports of the incidence of CPN in European rats were published, rats were housed 5 per cage, which is known to result in decreased feed consumption and decreased weight gain, relative to single housing. Second, gender is a determining factor in the development of CPN. Male rats have an earlier onset, higher incidence at any given age, and greater severity of lesions than do females. Third, diet is a critical factor and is also the factor that may be the most amenable to management solutions. It is now clear that moderate dietary restriction will greatly reduce the incidence and severity of CPN at any given age, relative to ad libitum overfeeding. The mechanism is hypothesized to be that overfeeding results in prolonged increases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (Gumprecht et al., 1993) . These increases cause glomerular hypertrophy, leading to macromolecule filtration deficits, mesangial damage, glomerulosclerosis, and protein leakage. Whatever the mechanism, however, 25-30% reduction in caloric intake, relative to ad libitum, results in decreased incidence and severity of CPN in female rats, and decreased severity of CPN in male rats, as well as increased survival in both sexes (Keenan et al., 1995a) .",

In contrast to CPN, which is more common in males, nephrocalcinosis is more common in female rats. In addition to gender, the incidence varies with age and strain and may occur in F-344 rats as young as 7 weeks old. The incidence in F-344 rats may reach 50%, whereas the lower incidence of 0-7% is reported in stocks of Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats (Montgomery and Seely, 1990 ). An especially high incidence is observed in BDIX rats. The incidence and severity of nephrocalcinosis may be increased by several dietary manipulations, including high levels of calcium, high phosphorus, low calcium/phosphorus ratios, or low magnesium (Percy and Barthold, 1993b) . However, it is not clear if dietary levels of these minerals are a key determining factor in the background incidence of nephrocalcinosis. Histologically (Short and Goldstein, 1992) , mineral deposition is observed most frequently at the corticomedullary junction, in cells of the pars recta and thin loops of Henle, as well as in the lumen of these tubules.",

Grossly, the heart is enlarged, occasionally with pale streaks visible. Increased weight of the heart correlates well with the degree of damage observed on histologic examination. Microscopically (Lewis, 1992) , there is necrosis of myocardial fibers and an interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells. Later in the course of the disease, fibrosis may be more prominent. Large reactive nuclei are also observed in myofibers. The most commonly affected myocardial sites are the papillary muscles and interventricular septum. As with chronic progressive nephropathy, the incidence of chronic progressive cardiomyopathy can be dramatically reduced at any age by moderate dietary restriction, i.e., reduction of 25-30% of total caloric intake relative to ad libitum overfed rats (Keenan et al., 1995b) .",

The most common change is thinning or loss of hair, especially over the back . This may be observed in any stock or strain but is especially common in the Brown Norway rat. Old albino rats also have a more yellow appearance at times, because of the accumulation of sebum in the skin. The rings of scales covering the tail increase in number with age to 190 at 1 year (English and Munger, 1992) . They continue to become more prominent and more yellowed with time after that. The yellowish material which accumulates on the tail and adjacent to the ear also may become black with time, probably from oxidation and/or bacterial action. In addition, male rats accumulate brown-pigmented foci on the skin, termed scales (Tayama and Shisa, 1994) . These scales can be detached and can overlay skin of \"normal\" color. They are found on the dorsum, with some on the tail and perineum. Scale formation is abrogated by gonadectomy. The nature of the pigment is unclear, but it may be oxidized lipid or amino acids. Alveolar histiocytosis is a very common incidental finding in the lung of aging rats of many stocks and strains . Grossly, alveolar histiocytosis is visible as white to pale tan foci, usually about 1 mm in diameter, visible on the pleural surface. The foci may extend slightly above the pleural surface in uninflated lung. Microscopically ), clusters of alveoli, often in a subpleural locations or adjacent to a terminal bronchiole, contain increased numbers of large, pale, foamy-appearing macrophages. Occasionally, cholesterol clefts may be visible in the more dense aggregates of macrophages, and a slight infiltration of lymphocytes may be present around adjacent vessels, probably as a response to proinflammatory mediators released by the macrophages. Alveolar histiocytosis should not be mistaken for any of the viral pneumonias of rats, because affected animals are seronegative, and any lymphoid infiltrate is slight and localized to the areas of macrophage aggregation. The cause of alveolar histiocytosis is not known, but it does not appear to be infectious.",
