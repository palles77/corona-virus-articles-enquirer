Extensive linkage maps and an impressive array of inbred strains are now available to expedite sophisticated genetic research. Mice have 40 chromosomes that are differentiated by the size and patterns of transverse bands. The chromosomes are designated by Arabic numbers in order of decreasing size. During the 1970s, chromosome rearrangements were used to assign known genetic linkage groups-identified by Roman numerals--to specific chromosomes and for determining locus order with respect to the centromere. Genes can now be located physically on chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and the Genome Initiative programs are fostering development of molecular maps of mouse chromosomes. The sequence of the mouse genome is expected to be completed by 2003 (Battey et al., 1999) .",

Mice carrying spontaneous or induced mutations and strains susceptible to specific diseases provide a wide variety of mouse model systems for basic research, as well as models for biomedical research to understand specific human disorders. For example, several spontaneous mutations in genes affecting pituitary function or producing hormones provide mutant models for human dwarfing conditions. Targeted mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein genes provide model systems for studying cardiovascular disorders. Mice of the NOD (nonobese diabetic) strain provide a model for human insulin-dependent diabetes. Mice also provide reagents for basic research. For example, inbred histocompatible strains are used extensively as donors of plasma cell tumors to immortalize cell lines (hybridomas) that secrete highly uniform, monospecific immunoglobulins in vitro, theoretically in unlimited quantities. This technology has made a full range of functional mouse antibody molecules available for study. Development of quantitative trait loci (QTL) methodology for mapping genes and the similarity between mouse and human genomes have made the mouse invaluable for identifying genes and underlying complex traits that are inherent to the most common human genetic diseases (Darvasi, 1998; Frankel, 1995) .",

Histocompatibility (H) loci control expression of cell surface molecules that modulate major immunological phenomena, such as the recognition of foreign tissue. For example, the time, onset, and speed of skin graft rejection are controlled by two groups of H loci. The major group is located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, H2) on chromosome 17. These genes cause rapid rejection (10-20 days) of grafts that display foreign H2 antigens. Minor H loci groups are scattered throughout the genome and are responsible for delayed graft rejection. Genes associated with the H2 complex also control other immunological functions, such as cell-cell interactions in primary immune responses and the level of response to a given antigen. Immunemediated responses to infectious agents such as viruses and complement activity are influenced directly or indirectly by the H2 complex. The most recent comprehensive review of the H2 complex is by Klein (1986) . Because information about this subject is being published so frequently, the reader is advised to consult bibliographic indexes such as MEDLINE for recent updates. Non-MHC or minor histocompatibility systems also are under active study (Roopenian and Simpson, 2000) .",

Table I summarizes nine breeding systems. Each requires technical skill and a firm understanding of mammalian genetics. Inbred strains were developed first in 1909 by Clarence Cook Little and offer a high degree of genetic uniformity. Mice within an inbred strain, for practical purposes, are genetically identical to other mice of the same strain and sex. They are defined as being produced by brother-sister matings for more than 20 generations. In fact, a strain should not be considered completely inbred until after 40 generations of sibling matings. Inbred strains are valuable because experimental results are reproducible with relatively small sample sizes. They are useful for genetic mapping because they are genetically well characterized, and allelic combinations can be predetermined for linkage crosses. Wild-derived inbred strains of Mus musculus castaneus and M. spretus are used extensively for mapping because of the large number of polymorphic differences from standard inbred laboratory mice. F1 hybrid mice, produced by mating mice of two inbred strains, also are genetically identical to each other and may offer a more robust animal for some studies. For example, inbred strains may differ in behavior and learning abilities, whereas hybrid mice are less likely to have learning deficits or behavioral anomalies. Mutant inbred strains carry spontaneous, targeted, or induced mutations, transgenes, or chromosome aberrations. The genetic backgrounds of such strains are homogeneous like those of regular inbred strains, but some (or all) mice of the strain carry the mutation (or chromosome aber- Table I Green (1981a) Green (1981a) Flaherty (1981) Green (1981a) Flaherty (1981) Green (1981a) Bailey (1971) Demant and Hart (1986) a Modified from Green (1981 a) . ration). In segregating inbred mutant strains, mutant mice differ from their nonmutant siblings only by the mutation. Therefore, littermates can serve as controls in experiments. In homozygous mutant strains, controls must come from the same or a closely related nonmutant inbred strain. For example, C57BL/6J mice provide controls for the homozygous mutant C57BL/6J-m/m strain. A strain is said to be coisogenic if the mutation of interest occurred in that strain. A strain is congenic if the mutation or gene of interest was transferred from another strain or stock by repeated backcrossing. Detailed descriptions and diagrams of mating schemes have been provided by Green (198 l a, b) , and additional contemporary information on mouse genetics and breeding can be found by consulting Table II .",

            "text": "In contrast to inbred mice, random bred, or outbred, mice are genetically heterogeneous and are often produced by breeding systems that intentionally minimize inbreeding. Outbred mice may be used when high genetic heterogeneity is desired or for experiments requiring large numbers of mice. However, it is preferable to ensure genetic heterogeneity by intercrossing multiple inbred strains to achieve heterogeneity with known genetic input. Individual random bred mice within a colony may differ in coat color, histocompatibility loci, enzyme and DNA polymorphisms, and other characteristics. Random breeding requires the statistically random selection of breeders by using a random numbers table or computer program. Random breeding, or outbreeding, can be achieved only in a large colony. A small breeding population or passage through the genetic \"bottleneck\" of rederivation to improve health status will reduce genetic heterogeneity and lead eventually to some degree of inbreeding. In fact, supposedly \"random bred\" stocks are often genetically quite homogeneous. In a population of 25 breeding pairs, for example, heterozygosity will decrease at 1% per generation with standard randomization techniques. A random breeding program that is easy to manage is the circular pair mating system, in which each pair is mated only once. Conceptually, cages are visualized in a circle, and each cage contains one breeding pair in the nth generation. Another \"circular\" set of cages serves as the breeding nucleus for the n + 1 generation. Each mated pair in the nth generation contributes one female and one male to the n + 1 generation. Random breeding is accomplished by assigning the female and male derived from each nth generation cage to different cages in the n + 1 generation.",

            "text": "Recombinant inbred (RI) strains are sets of inbred strains developed by single-pair random matings of mice from an F2 generation created by crossing mice of two inbred strains. Lines are propagated by brother-sister matings for more than 20 generations to obtain homozygosity. Recombinant inbred strains may take as long as 7 years to produce. RI strains are valuable for mapping phenotypic or quantitative traits that differ between the progenitor strains. Because each line is inbred, genotyping and phenotyping data are cumulative. RI sets are especially valuable for controlling for environmental variability in a trait, because several genetically identical mice from each line in a set can be typed to score the line for a trait (Bailey, 1971; Taylor, 1996) . Recombinant congenic strains are sets of inbred strains derived in a manner similar to that for RI sets, except that one or more backcrosses to one parental strain (designated the background strain) are made after the F1 generation, before inbreeding is begun. The other parental strain is designated as the donor strain. The proportion of background and donor genomes is determined by the number of backcrosses preceding inbreeding (Demant and Hart, 1986) . Advanced intercross Lines (AILs) are a third type of RI line. AILs are made by producing an F2 generation between two inbred strains and then, in each subsequent generation, intercrossing mice but avoiding sibling matings. The purpose is to increase the possibility of recombination between tightly linked genes.

Strains are designated by a series of letters and/or numbers, which frequently provide a shorthand description of the origin and history of the strain (Table III) . For example, the inbred strain C57BL/6J originated from female 57 at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (C), was the black (BL) line from this female, and is subline number 6. Sublines of an inbred strain are designated using Laboratory Registration Codes (Lab Codes), unique-2-to 4-letter codes that may be obtained from a central registry maintained at the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research in Washington, D.C. <http://www4.nationalacademies.org/cls/ilarhome.nsf>. The J in C57BL/6J means it is the subline maintained at the Jackson Laboratory (J). A new type of strain designation has been created for new inbred strains made by intercrossing mice of two existing inbred strains. This is essential because many engineered mutations are made in 129-derived embryonic stem cells, recovered in C57BL/6-129 chimeras, and then maintained by brother-sister matings after the first generation. For example, an inbred strain derived by sibling matings from a C57BL/6 \u2022 129 chimera is designated B6129. A noninbred stock that meets specific criteria is designated by placing the Lab Code before the stock symbol, separated by a full colon. For example, Hsd:ICR designates an ICR outbred stock maintained by Harlan (\"International standardized nomenclature,\" 1972) . Specific designations also distinguish coisogenic, congenic, segregating inbred, and various RI strains. The type of strain or stock often can be recognized from the correct symbol. For example,. BXD-1/Ty is line 1 in a set of RI strains derived from a C57BL/6J (B) female mated to a DBA/2J (D) male and made by Taylor (Ty) .",

When a mutant gene is cloned, the symbol for the parent gene is used and the mutant allele is designated in superscript. For example, Mbp shi is the shiverer mutant allele in the myelin basic protein gene. Nomenclature for genetically engineered mice can be complex and may eventually require simplification. Currently, a transgenic strain is designated by a symbol for the strain followed by a symbol for the transgene. Transgene symbols take the form Tg(YYYYY) #Zzz, where Tg is the transgene, (YYYYY) is a brief description of the inserted DNA (such as a gene symbol), # is the assigned number in the series of events generated using a given construct, and Zzz is the Lab Code. When a transgene causes an insertional mutation in an endogenous gene, the mutant allele of the gene is designated by using the gene symbol and an abbreviation for the transgene as a superscript (e.g., inrg/zz~). A targeted mutation, or knockout, is designated by the mutated gene with the identification of the mutational event as a superscript. For example, Cftr fml Unc is the first mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene created at the University of North Carolina. A gene replacement, or knockin, uses similar nomenclature; Myf5 My~ indicates that the Myf5 gene was replaced by the Myod gene.",

The integrity of the microenvironment is maintained by servicing and changing cages in specifically designed hoods. Mouse cages vary in design, size, and composition.

In the mid-1960s, Schaedler was the first to colonize germfree mice with selected bacteria isolated from normal mice (Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983) . He subsequently supplied animal breeders with this group of microorganisms. These defined bacteria included aerobic bacteria and some less oxygen-sensitive anaerobic organisms. The so-called extremely oxygen-sensitive (EOS) fusiform bacteria, which make up the majority of the normal microbiota of rodents, were not included, because of technical difficulties in isolation and cultivation. Of the defined microbiotas later used for gnotobiotic studies, the one known as the \"Schaedler flora\" was the most popular. In 1978, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) decided to revise the Schaedler flora, or \"cocktail\" consisting of eight bacteria, in order to stan- Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983.) dardize the microbiota used to colonize germfree rodents.

It is necessary to demonstrate that microorganisms of the specified microbiota are present and that adventitious microorganisms are absent. In the past, monitoring relied on bacterial morphology, limited evaluation of biochemical traits, and growth characteristics. Recently, the eight ASF strains were identified taxonomically by 16S rRNA sequence analysis . Three strains were previously identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus (strain ASF 360), L. salivarius (strain ASF 361), and Bacteroides distasonis (strain ASF 519), based on phenotypic criteria. 16S rRNA analysis indicated that each of the strains differed from its presumptive identity. The 16S rRNA sequence of strain ASF 361 is essentially identical to the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of L. murinis and L. animalis (both isolated from mice), and all of these strains probably belong to a single species. closely related to the genus Porphyromonas. The spiral-shaped strain, strain ASF 457, is in the Flexistipes phylum and exhibits sequence identity with rodent isolates of Robertson. The remaining four ASF strains, which are EOS fusiform bacteria, group phylogenetically with the low-G+C content gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes, Bacillus-Clostridium group) (Fig. 6) . The 16S rRNA sequence information determined by Dewhirst et al.

The cortex is divided into B lymphocyte domains, called primary follicles, and T lymphocyte domains, known as the diffuse cortex. The mouse does not have palatine or pharyngeal tonsils. The spleen lies adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach. Different strains of mice have varying degrees of accessory splenic tissue.

Most lymphocytes enter and leave the spleen in the bloodstream. The so-called white pulp of the spleen is organized along the central arteriole and is subdivided into T and B cell zones. The periarteriolar sheath is composed mainly of CD4 \u00a7 and CD8 \u00a7 T cells, and lymph follicles, which often contain germinal centers, are located at the periphery.

Thymectomy is routinely performed in immunological research for experimental manipulation of the immune system. Thymectomy of newborn mice causes a decrease in circulating lymphocytes and marked impairment of certain immune responses, particularly cellular immune responses. Thymectomy in adult mice produces no immediate effect, but several months later mice may develop a progressive decline of circulating lymphocytes and impaired cellular immune responses.

The hypophysis is usually responsive to hormonal influence by day 6 in the male and day 12 in the female. Ovarian follicle development begins at 3 weeks of age and matures by 30 days. Rising levels of gonadotropins evoke signs of sexual maturity at about the same age. in the female, estrogen-dependent changes such as cornification of vaginal epithelium at the vaginal opening can occur as early as 24-28 days. Puberty is slightly later in the male (up to 2 weeks). Sexual maturation varies among strains and stocks of mice and is subject to seasonal and environmental influences.

Pheromones have been divided into two broad categories: primer pheromones and releaser pheromones (Wilson, 1970) . Primer pheromones are probably detected by the vomeronasal organs, which relay messages to the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in modulated behavior. Releaser pheromones trigger a prompt CNSmediated behavioral response in a recipient. Pheromones most frequently affect developmental and reproductive processes. Primer pheromones produced by males also regulate the reproductive physiology of female mice (Keverne, 1998) . More than one response can be elicited by the same pheromone. For example, small, structurally diverse ligands, which bind to the major urinary protein of male mice, demonstrate puberty-accelerated pheromone activity in recipient females. Four of these ligands have been implicated in estrus sychronization (Whitten effect). However, the same chemosensory substances now appear to be responsible for both sexual maturation and estrus cycling in female mice (Novotny et al., 1999) . Pheromone communication must be accounted for in the management of mouse colonies, particularly when subtle behavioral traits or reproductive performance are critical (Ma et al., 1998) .",

Hair nibbling and whisker chewing are examples of social dominance (Fig. 11 ). These traits may be an exaggeration of inherited grooming behavior. Dominant mice usually retain their whiskers--hence the name barber mouse. Hair loss from barbering must be distinguished from hair loss due to ectoparasitism, microbial dermatitides, and abrasions from improperly designed cage covers. Maintenance behavior, such as eating and drinking, is cyclic and occurs mostly during the evening or at night.

The widespread use of genetically engineered mice is likely to modify current concepts because of novel or unpredictable interactions among genetic alterations, the genetic backgrounds on which they are expressed, and exogenous factors, such as infectious agents. Because the number of combinations is extraordinarily high, clinical and laboratory diagnosticians should be alert to the potential for altered disease expression in genetically engineered mice and not be misled by unexpected signs, lesions, and epizootiology.",

            "text": "Many of the agents and conditions discussed under Section III,A, may interfere with mouse-based research. Housing and husbandry in microbiologically sheltered environments are designed to reduce the risks of disruptive infection, especially among immunologically dysfunctional mice, but must be accompanied by effective microbiological surveillance. Several principles are worthy of emphasis at the outset. (1) Surveillance should encomPass resident mice and mouse products (serum, cell lines, transplantable tumors) procured from external sources. Many commercial vendors currently provide sound, contemporary microbiological data on animals that they sell. Further, it is impractical, logistically and financially, to test every batch of commercially procured animals. However, thorough quarantine and testing of mice and mouse products from noncommercial sources should be mandatory. (2) Testing should be consonant with institutional needs. Therefore consideration must be given to the list of agents for which testing will be done, the minimum prevalence level for a given infection that testing is designed to detect, the frequency of testing, the number and location of animals to be tested per unit of time, sample collection strategies, and costs. Additionally, it is important to consider the impact of modern housing systems on detection strategies. Microbarrier cages, while protecting mice against infection, may also limit detection of low-level infection by impeding cage-to-cage transmission. Therefore detection should include preemptive exposure of sentinel mice to multiple bedding samples or the complementary use of molecular diagnostics to sample animals, soiled bedding, or spent air from ventilated cage racks. (3) The tests selected should provide a high degree Cytokine of sensitivity and specificity. The traditional benchmark for testing is serology, but molecular diagnostics, microscopy (especially for parasites), and isolation of the agent (especially of bacteria) may be justified for detection or verification. (4) Interpretation of test results and resulting strategies to eliminate or contain infection should be based on a thorough knowledge of the agent under consideration, its potential effects on mice knowingly or potentially exposed, and the validity of the testing and surveillance methods. Because effective surveillance strategies will vary with research needs and operating conditions, it is prudent to consult at least several literature sources about options for testing and monitoring for infectious agents and disease before launching or modifying a surveillance program (Barthold, 1998; de Souza and Smith, 1989; FELASA, 1994 FELASA, , 1996 Lindsey et al., 1991a; Lussier, 1991; Nicklas et al., 1993; Rehg and Toth, 1998; Small, 1984; Waggie et al., 1994; Weisbroth et al., 1998; White et al., 1998) .

Mousepox is caused by ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus that is closely related antigenically and physicochemically to vaccinia virus. Field strains of ectromelia virus have been isolated in many countries, but several, including Hampstead (low virulence), Moscow (high virulence), and NIH-79 (high virulence), have been used extensively for laboratory study. Ectromelia virus grows well on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated chicken eggs and can also infect HeLa cells, mouse fibroblasts (L cells), and chick embryo fibroblasts. The BS-C-1 cell line is particularly sensitive to infection. Ectromelia virus produces an envelope hemagglutinin whose detection forms the basis for hemagglutination inhibition, a historically important serological test for mousepox.",

The expression of clinical signs reflects an interplay among virus-related factors, including virulence and dose, and host-related factors, including age, genotype, immunological competence, and portal of entry. Acute lethal infection occurs in genetically susceptible strains (Briody, 1959) . Outbreaks among susceptible mice are often volatile, with variable morbidity and high mortality. Clinical signs such as ruffled fur or prostration, may occur for only a few hours before death. This rapidly fatal form is associated with multisystemic necrosis. Mice that survive acute infection can develop chronic disease characterized by a skin rash whose severity depends on the extent of viremia secondary to infection of parenchymal organs. The rash can develop anywhere on the body and may be focal or generalized (Fig. 12) . Conjunctivitis also may occur. The skin lesions usually recede within several weeks, but hairless scars can remain. Additionally, severe viral infection of the feet and tail during the rash syndrome can lead to necrosis and amputation.",

For example, contaminated mouse serum was responsible for recent outbreaks in the United States (Dick et al., 1996; . Natural exposure is thought to occur through skin abrasions, but oral inoculation can cause chronic inapparent infection of Peyer's patches accompanied by prolonged excretion of virus in feces. Mice with chronic skin disease can transmit infection by contact and also are a source of contaminated tissues. Intranasal inoculation can produce necrotizing rhinitis and pneumonia in addition to systemic disease. However, tcage-tocage transmission of infection is low and can be virtually nil if cage bonnets are employed (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b) . Ectromelia virus is highly stable at room temperature, especially under dry conditions, leading to the potential for prolonged environmental contamination in infected colonies (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987c ). Aerogenic exposure is not a major factor in natural outbreaks, and arthropod-borne transmission does not appear to occur. However, intrauterine infection and fetal deaths have been reported. Therefore contamination of cesareanderived progeny or embryo-derived cell cultures is possible.",

DBA/1, DBA/2, BALB/c, A, and C3H mice are among the inbred strains most susceptible to lethal infection, whereas C57BL/6 and AKR are resistant (Wallace, et al., 1985; Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987a) . Immunodeficient mice also should be considered highly susceptible. The mechanisms of genetic resistance are not fully understood but appear to reflect multiple genes, some of which appear to be expressed through lymphoreticular cells, including natural killer cells Gras, 1995, Jacoby et al., 1989) . Natural transmission is facilitated by intermediately resistant mice. They frequently survive long enough to develop skin lesions that can shed virus and serve as a major reservoir for spread of infection. The risks for transmission are further increased by persistence of infectious virus in excreta and exfoliated scabs. Although virus excretion typically lasts for about 3 weeks, virus has been found in scabs and/or feces for up to 16 weeks. Resistant mouse strains also are dangerous because they can shed virus during asymptomatic infections. However, infections in resistant mice tend to be short-lived. Ironically, highly susceptible mice are a relatively small hazard for dissemination of infection, if properly discarded, because they die before virus shedding becomes prominent. Thus, the juxtaposition of enzootically infected and highly susceptible mice can provoke explosive outbreaks. Infant and aged mice are usually more susceptible to lethal infection than young adult mice. Maternal immunity among enzootically infected breeding mice may perpetuate infection by protecting young mice from death, but not from infection. Such mice may subsequently transmit infection by contact exposure.",

            "text": "The primary skin lesion, which occurs 6-10 days after exposure, is a localized swelling that enlarges from inflammatory edema. Necrosis of dermal epithelium provokes a surface scab and heals as a deep, hairless scar. Secondary skin lesions (rash) develop 2-3 days later as the result of viremia. They are often multiple and widespread and can be associated with Fenner, 1948.) conjunctivitis, with blepharitis, and, in severe cases, with buccal and lingual ulcers. The skin lesions also can ulcerate and scab before scarring. Diagnosis. Mousepox can be diagnosed from clinical signs, lesions, serological tests, and demonstration of virus or viral antigen in tissues. Detection of characteristic intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions aids detection of infection. Virus can be isolated from infected tissues by inoculation of cell cultures (BS-C-1) or embryonated eggs. Several serological tests are available to detect mousepox. Historically, the standard test was hemagglutination inhibition (HA1), using vaccinia antigen as a source of hemagglutinin. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is more sensitive and specific and has replaced HAI for serological monitoring among nonvaccinated mice (Buller et al., 1983) . Ectromelia virus infection also can be detected by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay (Neubauer et al., 1997) . Serological differentiation of mousepox from vaccinia infection in vaccinated mice is based on the lack of hemagglutinin in the vaccine strain of virus. Thus, serum from vaccinated mice may react by ELISA but should not react by HAI.",

Because modern housing and husbandry methods based on the use of microbarrier caging are effective for containing infection, testing and culling properly isolated mice is a potential alternative, especially for irreplaceable breeding mice, such as transgenic founders. Such mice can be quarantined along with cessation of breeding to permit resolution of infection (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987b) .

The prevalence of MCMV in laboratory mice is unresolved, because infection is clinically silent and serological surveillance is not widely practiced. Wild mice serve as a natural reservoir for infection, which implies that entry of virus into a modern vivarium is most likely to occur from contaminated animal products. Susceptibility to experimental infection varies with age, dose, route, virus strain, and host genotype. Infection can occur in young and adult mice.

The resistance of rodent parvoviruses to environmental inactivation increases the risks of transmission after virus is excreted. Therefore, contamination of caging, bedding, food, and .clothing must be considered a risk for the spread of infection. Transmission occurs by oronasal exposure, but viral contamination of biologicals used for experimental inoculation, such as transplantable tumors, also can be a source of infection. Continuous contact exposure to infected animals or soiled bedding usually induces a humoral immune response within 3 weeks, but limited exposure may delay seroconversion. Young mice in enzootically infected colonies are protected by maternal antibody, but actively acquired immunity develops from infection sustained after the decay of maternal immunity. MVM, in contrast to MPV, is not thought to cause persistent infection; infection in immunocompetent adult mice usually lasts less than 3 weeks (Smith, 1983b; Smith and Paturzo, 1988 ). Infection appears to last less than 1 month even in oronasally inoculated neonatal mice. Although MVM has not been studied in immunodeficient mice, one should assume that infection will be prolonged in such mice. There is no evidence that MVM is transmitted in utero.",

The virus was isolated following its detection as a lymphocytotropic contaminant in in vitro assays for cellular immunity. The virus grew lytically in a CD8 \u00a7 T cell clone designated L3 and inhibited the proliferation of cloned T cells stimulated with antigen or interleukin 2 (IL-2). Additional isolates confirmed that these viruses are antigenically distinct from MVM. Thus, they constitute a second and distinct serogroup of murine parvoviruses. Molecular analysis of MPV indicates that regions encoding the NS proteins are similar to those of MVM, a finding that accounts for cross-reactivity between the viruses in generic serological tests. However, they differ significantly in regions encoding the capsid proteins, accounting for their antigenic specificity (Ball-Goodrich and Johnson, 1994) . The prototype isolate was first called an \"orphan\" parvovirus of mice because its biology and significance were obscure, but it has subsequently been named mouse parvovirus (MPV). MPV is very difficult to grow in vitro. Immor-talized T cells (L3) are the only cells found thus far to support replication of MPV.",

Modern husbandry and health care have essentially eliminated natural exposure in laboratory mice. Because infection can be introduced inadvertently and is highly contagious, some additional features are highlighted here. Inoculation of neonatal mice with contaminated biologicals or cell cultures is a potential source of entry and spread. Once infection is established, virus is shed in urine, feces, and saliva, followed by intranasal exposure of other mice. Thus airborne dissemination results primarily from contaminated feed and bedding. Intrauterine infection also can occur, and persistent renal infection, contracted neonatally, can be reactivated during pregnancy. Exposure of neonatal mice also can result in viremic dissemination and high mortality. Additionally, survivors can be persistently infected and excrete virus from lung and kidney for months. Infection of breeding-age mice usually results in rapid clearance of virus and protection of offspring by maternally derived antibodies. However, PCR has revealed infection lasting up to 5 months in CBA mice inoculated with virus as adults (Berke and Dalianis, 1993) . Polyomavirus infection can persist in adult immunodeficient mice.",

Among common laboratory species, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection, but only the mouse and the hamster are known to transmit virus. LCMV infection is not prevalent in laboratory mice produced and maintained in modern quarters. Infection is usually introduced through inoculation of virus-infected biologicals, such as transplantable tumors, or by feral mice. Wild mice are a natural reservoir of infection and a potential threat to research colonies if they gain entry inadvertently. Carrier mice usually develop as a result of asymptomatic prenatal or neonatal infection, which induces tolerance to the virus. Such mice can have persistently high con- centrations of virus in many organs, thereby facilitating virus excretion in saliva, nasal secretions, and urine. Persistently infected neonates usually reach breeding age and can perpetuate infection in a breeding colony. Thus introduction of a single LCMV carrier mouse to a breeding colony can eventually result in a high prevalence of persistently infected mice. Infection in adult mice, by contrast, is often acute because of the onset of effective immunity, and the spread of virus is halted. Horizontal spread of infection is enhanced by close contact, but rapid horizontal spread is not characteristic. Mice can transmit LCMV to hamsters, which can remain viremic and \"viruric for many months even if they contract infection as adults. Infected hamsters can transmit virus to other hamsters and mice and are the primary source of human LCMV infection (see Chapter 5). Infected mice are not a significant source of human exposure.

However, lesions comparable to experimentally induced disease are rare during natural infection. Intracerebral inoculation of virus into immunocompetent adult mice can induce nonsuppurative leptomeningitis, choroiditis, and focal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Host tissues are damaged during the course of the cellular immune response to the virus. The character of visceral lesions depends on virus strain and mouse strain; the ratio of cytolytic to proliferative responses in lymphoid organs is mouse strain-dependent. In severe infection, nonsuppurative inflammation can occur in many tissues. The severity of accompanying cytolytic lesions seems to parallel the intensity of cellular immunity. Liver lesions can include hepatocytic necrosis accompanied by nodular infiltrates of lymphoid cells and Kupffer's cells, activated sinusoidal endothelium, an occasional granulocyte or megakaryocyte, and fatty metamorphosis. Cytolysis, cell proliferation, and fibrinoid necrosis can develop in lymphoid organs. Necrosis of cortical thym0cytes can lead to thymic involution. Lesions of late-onset disease are characterized by formation of immune complexes and associated inflammation. Renal glomeruli and the choroid plexus are most severely affected, but complexes may also be trapped in synovial membranes, blood vessel walls, and skin. Lymphoid nodules can form in various organs. Lesions associated with early deaths in neonatally infected mice have not been thoroughly described but include hepatic necrosis. The lesions of acute and persistent LCMV infection reflect separate immunopathological processes. In adult mice with acute LCMV infection, virus multiplies in B cells and macrophages, whereas T cells are resistant. Internal viral epitopes induce humoral immune responses, but surface epitopes elicit cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing antibodies. Thus elimination of virus and virus-associated immunological injury are both T cell-mediated. This apparent paradox has been explained by the view that prompt cellular immunity limits viral replication and leads to host survival, whereas slower cellular immune responses permit viral spread and increase the number of virus-infected target cells subject to attack once immunity is fully developed. Antibody can be detected by 1 week after infection but does not play a significant role in eliciting acute disease. Lesions of LCMV infection appear to develop from direct T cell-mediated damage to virus-infected cells and may involve humoral factors released from immune effector T cells. LCMV also can suppress humoral and cellular immunity in acutely infected mice.",

Employment of adult contact sentinel mice is a useful strategy for detecting LCMV infection by seroconversion. Alternatively, small blood samples can be collected from persistently infected live suspects, which are often viremic, and used to inoculate cultured cells or adult and neonatal mice. Intracerebral inoculation of LCMV-positive tissues should elicit neurological signs in adult mice within 10 days, whereas infant mice should remain asmptomatic. Histological examination of brains from affected adults may reveal nonsuppurative inflammation, but lesions may be minimal in mice infected with viscerotropic isolates. Immunohistochemistry can be used to detect viral antigen in brains of suckling and adult mice. Intraperitoneal inoculation of adult mice may yield short-lived infection with seroconversion, i.e., the mouse antibody protection test. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay also is available (Park et al., 1997) . Virus can be grown and quantified in several continuous cell lines, including mouse neuroblastoma (N-18) cells, BHK-21 cells, and L cells. Application of immunofluorescence staining to detect LCMV antigen in inoculated cultured cells yields results more quickly than animal inoculation. Of course, all diagnostic procedures involving potential contact with live virus should be carried out under strict containment conditions to avoid infection of laboratory personnel. The use of in vitro detection has the added advantage, in this regard, of reducing biohazardous exposure and the use of live animals for testing.",

Typical changes begin with inflammatory edema of bronchial lamina propria, which may extend to alveolar ducts, alveoli, and perivascular spaces. Necrosis and exfoliation of bronchial epithelium ensue, frequently in a segmental pattern (Fig. 24 ). Alveolar epithelium also may desquamate, especially in severe disease, and necrotic cell debris and inflammatory cells can accumulate in airways and alveolar spaces. Alveolar septae are usually infiltrated by leukocytes to produce interstitial pneumonia. Lymphoid cells also invade epibronchial and perivascular spaces.

This apparent paradox may be attributable an immunopathological mechanism in the development of Sendai viral pneumonia. Local immunoglobulin synthesis by infiltrating cells also occurs.

Early clinical and laboratory investigations emphasized their potential to induce hepatitis, so their original designation, which is still used actively, is mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Experience has shown, however, that hepatitis is not a common feature of natural infection in immunocompetent mice. Five prototype strains have received much attention from research scientists. They are: JHM (MHV4), MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-A59. However, numerous additional strains have since been identified that differ in virulence, tissue tropism, and antigenicity. This reflects the fact that mutation is common among coronaviruses, a property that increases risks for recurrent infection. As described further below, MHV isolates are often categorized according to their organotropism into two biotypes: enterotropic strains, which infect primarily the intestinal tract, and polytropic strains, which initially infect the respiratory tract but often progress to multisystemic dissemination (Homberger, 1997) . However, isolates may contain features of both biotypes. Although MHV isolates and strains share internal antigens (M and N), they can be distinguished by neutralization tests that detect strain-specific spike (S) antigens. MHV shares antigens with the coronaviruses of rats, a finding that has been exploited to develop heterologous antigens for serological tests. MHV also is related to human coronavirus OC43.",

NCTC 1469 mouse liver cells are useful for growing many polytropic strains. Enterotropic strains have been grown in CMT-93 cells derived from a rectal carcinoma in a C57BL mouse but are generally difficult to propagate in cell culture. MHV can also be grown in mouse macrophages, cells that have been used for genetic studies of resistance and Clinical signs. The prevalence and severity of clinical signs depend primarily on the age, strain, and immunological status of infected mouse and strain and tropism of virus (Barthold et al., 1993b) . As with many murine viruses, infection is often clinically silent among immunologically competent mature mice. Clinical morbidity is most often associated with suckling mice less than 2 weeks old or with immunodeficient mice. Suckling mice develop signs in various combinations that include diarrhea, inappetance, dehydration, weight loss, lassitude, and ruffled pelage, often terminating in death (Fig. 28 ). Neurotropic strains such as MHV-JHM may induce flaccid paralysis of the hindlimbs, but this sign is rarely encountered alone during natural infection. Conjunctivitis, convulsions, and circling may be seen occasionally. Mildly pathogenic strains may not cause acute disease in athymic mice but rather can cause a progressive wasting syndrome that may be accompanied by progressive paralysis.",

            "text": "MHV infection is, for all practical purposes, an affliction of mice and arguably the most common viral infection in this species. A recent national survey reported MHV in nearly 60% of more than 100 major vivariums, usually among conventionally housed mice but also in more than 10% of barrier-housed colonies (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1997) . There are no reports of natural transmission from mice to other species, but suckling rats can develop necrotizing rhinitis after intranasal inoculation with MHV-S. Sex-related or seasonal differences in susceptibility have not been found. MHV should be considered highly contagious, with natural transmission occurring by respiratory or oral routes. Recent reports suggest that enterotropic biotypes predominate in natural infections (Hom-berger et al., 1998) . Feces and nasopharyngeal exudates can serve as sources of infection. Natural vertical transmission has not been demonstrated. Introduction of MHV through injection of contaminated biologicals can be an important factor in epizootics, especially because some isolates infect B lymphocytes and, by implication, hybridomas nonlytically. Infection in immunocompetent mice is self-limiting. Immunemediated clearance of virus associated with seroconversion usually begins about a week after infection, and mice recover fully within 3 -4 weeks. Humoral and cellular immunity appears to participate in host defenses to infection, and T celldependent immunity is an absolute requirement. Thus, agerelated resistance to MHV correlates with maturation of lymphoreticular tissues. Enzootic infection had been construed to include persistent infection in individual mice. Current evidence suggests, however, that enzootic infection results either from the fresh and continuous introduction of immunologically naive or deficient mice or from the recurrent infection of immune mice with MHV variants that arise by natural mutation. Mutation is favored by immune pressures in enzootically infected colonies as well as missteps during natural replication, which include copying errors and recombination. Thus, mice that have developed immunity to one strain of MHV can remain susceptible to one or more genetically and antigenically divergent strains, resulting in reinfection (Barthold and Smith, 1989a,b; Homberger et al., 1992) . This caveat has practical importance for breeding colonies. Maternal immunity protects suckling mice against homologous MHV strains but not against antigenically variant strains. However, maternal immunity, even to homologous strains, depends on the presence of maternally acquired antibody in the lumen of the intestine. Therefore, the susceptibility of young mice increases significantly at weaning.",

For example, DBA/2 mice are highly susceptible to MHV-3 and die acutely even as adults, whereas A/J mice develop resistance to lethal infection shortly after weaning. However, genetic resistance also is virus strain-dependent. Therefore, mice resistant to one strain of MHV may be susceptible to another strain. It also is worth noting that the expanded use of genetically altered mice with novel or unanticipated deficits in antiviral responses may alter the outcome of virus-host interactions unpredictably. This pertains to MHV as well as other agents. For example, MHV infection has presented as granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis in interferon-gamma knockout mice (France et al., 1999) .",

Viremic dissemination can follow if virus gains access to regional blood vessels and lymphatics. Thus, viremia leads to secondary infection of vascular endothelium and parenchymal tissues in multiple organs including liver, brain, lymphoid organs, and other sites. Mice also may develop central nervous system disease by direct extension of infection from the olfactory mucosa along olfactory tracts. At necropsy, yellow-white foci indicative of necrosis can occur in multiple tissues, with the involvement of the liver as the classical lesion. Liver involvement may be accompanied by icterus and peritonitis. Histologically, necrosis can be focal or confluent and may be infiltrated by inflammatory cells (Fig. 29) . Syncytia commonly form at the margin of necrotic areas and, in mild infections, may develop in the absence of frank necrosis. Syncytia formation is a hallmark of infection in many tissues, including intestine (Fig. 27) , lung, liver, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, brain, and bone marrow and in vascular endothelium in general. Although syncytia are transient in immunocompetent mice, they are a persistent feature in chronically infected, immunodeficient mice (Fig. 30) . Neurotropic variants cause acute necrotizing encephalitis or meningoencephalitis in suckling mice, with demyelination in the brain stem and in peri-ependymal areas secondary to viral invasion of oligodendroglia. Convalescent mice may have residual mononuclear cell infiltrates around vessels or as focal lesions in the liver. Immunodeficient mice can develop smoldering necrotic lesions in the liver and elsewhere. Compensatory splenomegaly may occur because of expansion of hematopoietic tissue.",

Pathogenic strains can cause lesions ranging from villus attentuation and atrophy to fulminant necrotizing enterotyphlocolitis, which can kill suckling mice within several days (Fig. 31) . The stomach is often empty, and the intestine is filled with watery to mucoid yellowish, sometimes gaseous contents. Hemorrhage or rupture of the intestine can occur. Syncytia are a consistent feature in viable mucosa and not only are formed in intestine but also may be pres- ent in mesenteric lymph nodes and endothelium of mesenteric vessels. Enterocytes may contain intracytoplasmic inclusions, but they are not diagnostic. Surviving mice develop compensatory mucosal hyperplasia, which eventually recedes. Older, more resistant mice usually develop transient syncytia without necrotic lesions.

Many animal resources rely on sentinel mouse protocols for continuous serological surveillance, because immune dysfunction can delay or abrogate seroconversion among research mice. ELISA and IFA tests are well established, sensitive, and reliable (Smith, 1983a; . Neutralization tests are used to differentiate individual virus strains in the research laboratory but are problematic for routine use, because of cost, technical complexity, and the effects of natural antigenic mutation inherent to MHV. Additionally, strain-specific, serologic identification per se does not predict biological behavior, including virulence or tissue tropism. Serology also can be used in the context of mouse antibody production assays in which adult mice are inoculated with suspect tissues to elicit seroconversion. Molecular diagnostics are being applied more widely for the diagnosis of MHV infection. PCR protocols to detect virus in tissues or excreta are available (Casebolt et al., 1997; Homberger et al., 1991; Yamada et al., 1993) , and access to testing can be obtained from specialized laboratories. Clinical signs of diarrhea, acute death, or neurological deficits are suggestive but not pathognomonic. The detection of syncytia augmented, when possible, by immunohistochemistry to detect MHV antigens (Fig. 33) is a useful and practical means to confirm infection (Brownstein and Barthold, 1982) . This strategy should attempt to select mice that are in early stages of infection, because necrosis in infant mice or seroconversion in older mice may reduce the chances of detecting syncytia or viral antigens. The option of using immunodeficient mice as sentinels can be considered, because they sustain prolonged infection. However, they should be securely confined because they also amplify virus loads. If properly controlled, amplification in immunodeficient mice can, however, facilitate subsequent virus isolation in tissue culture.",

Additionally, maternally derived immunity can protect infant mice from infection until they are weaned and moved to uncontaminated quarters (Homberger, 1992; Lipman et al., 1987) . Careful testing with sentinel mice should be used to assess the effectiveness of quarantine or \"natural rederivation,\" as just described. This is especially true to account for the potential that a mutant variant could arise during quarantine and result in prolongation of colonywide infection. Immunodeficient mice, by contrast, are susceptible to chronic infection and viral excretion. Therefore, control measures must be more drastic and include depopulation. There also is an emerging gray zone, associated with the creation of genetically altered mice, in which decisions about control strategies are more problematic. It includes mice with unrecognized or unanticipated immune dysfunction or with selective immune dysfunction in which the impact of MHV infection is not known. Such colonies, which may contain highly valuable or irreplacable mice, may be rescued by cesarean rederivation or embryo transfer if vertical transmission of MHV infection is subsequently ruled out.

Control of feral mouse populations, proper husbandry and sanitation, and strict monitoring of biological materials that may harbor virus (e.g., transplantable neoplasms, cell lines) are also important strategies to prevent adventitious infection. (Compton et al., 1993; Homberger, 1997) , and the unpredictable outcome of infection in genetically altered mice is likely to lengthen the list. For example, and apart from its clinical impact, MHV may stimulate or suppress immune responses, contaminate transplantable neoplasms, and be reactivated by treatment of asymptomatically infected animals with several classes of drugs, including immunosuppressive agents, and by intercurrent infections. It also can alter tissue enzyme levels. Additionally, the ubiquitous threat of MHV infection and uncertainty about its potential effects on a given research project provoke concerns that may ex-ceed its true impact. For example, transient infection with a mild enterotropic strain is unlikely to disrupt systemic immune responses, whereas infection with a polytropic strain may be highly disruptive. This is not to say that asymptomatic or strictly enterotropic infection should be taken lightly but simply to caution against overreaction in assessing the impact of an outbreak.

It was discovered by Max Theiler during experimental studies of yellow fever virus in mice, so it is also referred to as Theiler's MEV or simply TMEV. Established strains include TO (Theiler's original), FA, DA, and GD VII, the last of which is named after George Martine (George's disease), an assistant in Theiler's laboratory. The virus is rapidly destroyed by temperatures over 50~ and by alcohol but not by ether. It can be cultivated in vitro in several continuous cell lines, but B HK-21 cells are routinely used for isolation and propagation.

Mycoplasma species may be difficult to grow, so it is prudent to confirm that the relevant expertise and quality control exist in the diagnostic laboratory.

The rolling becomes more constant, but mice occasionally leap or move rapidly. After 1-2 hr of rolling, animals become comatose and usually die within 4 hr. All published reports of rolling disease are associated with experimental inoculation of organisms or exotoxin. Large numbers of organisms are needed to produce disease, and there is no indication that, under natural conditions, organisms replicate in the brain to concentrations required for the induction of these signs. Because animals are frequently inoculated with biological materials by parenteral routes, contamination with M. neurolytica may induce rolling disease inadvertently. Diagnosis can be made from the appearance of typical clinical signs, astrocytic swelling, and isolation of the causative organism.

Stresses, such as overcrowding, high temperature and humidity, moist food, and immunosuppression, may predispose mice to Tyzzer's disease. Susceptibility and resistance also are influenced by host genotype. It has been shown, for example, that C57BL/6 mice are more resistant than DBA/2 mice to Tyzzer's disease (Waggie et al., 1981) . Resistance to severe infection appears to be due, in part, to B lymphocyte function. Athymic mice also appear to have increased susceptibility to Tyzzer's disease (Livingston et al., 1996) . The role of T cells in resistance is not clear, because susceptibility among athymic mice appears to vary. However, the involvement of T cells can be inferred by the fact that several interleukins modulate resistance and susceptibility.

Some strains appear capable of crossinfecting mice, rats, and hamsters, whereas others have a more restricted host range (Franklin et al., 1994) . Therefore the risks for cross-infection depend on the strain causing a given outbreak. The vegetative form of C. piliforme is unstable, but spores can retain infectivity at room temperature for at least 1 year and should be viewed as the primary means of spread. Natural infection is probably due to ingestion of organisms, which are subsequently shed in feces. Feces-contaminated food and soiled bedding are therefore the most likely sources of environmental contamination.

Hepatic necrosis also may occur adjacent to intralobular venules, which can contain microthrombi. Additionally, phlebitis may affect central veins. This lesion has been linked to the presence of organisms by silver stains and electron microscopy. Age-related hepatocytic proliferation can develop in infected livers, a response that is more pronounced in male mice than in female mice . This lesion may increasesusceptibility to hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas among aged male A/JCr and B6C3F1 mice from infected colonies.

Wide-scale, eradication of enzootic helicobacteriosis can be expensive and time-consuming, without guarantee of success. Careful husbandry procedures can limit infection within a colony (Whary et al., 2000) . Therefore, strategies have to be weighed carefully against risks of enzootic infection for the health and use of mice. By contrast, infection should be avoided in immunodeficient mice, including genetically engineered mice with targeted or serendipitous immune dysfunction. Lastly, the outcome of opportunistic helicobacteriosis has not been thoroughly examined. This condition could occur during simultaneous infection with two or more Helicobacter species or during combined infection with an intestinal virus (e.g., coronavirus) and Helicobacter spp. If highly valuable animals are exposed, antibiotic therapy or rederivation may be warranted.",

Some evidence suggests that staphylococci can produce primary cutaneous infections, but they are more likely opportunistic organisms that induce lesions after contamination of skin wounds. Eczematous dermatitis develops primarily on the face, ears, neck, shoulders, and forelegs and can progress to ulcerative dermatitis, abscessation (including botryomycotic granulomas), and cellulitis. Because lesions are often pruritic, scratching causes additional trauma and autoinoculation. Staphylococcal infection in the genital mucosa of males may produce preputial gland abscesses. These occur as firm, raised nodules in the inguinal region or at the base of the penis and may rupture to spread infection to surrounding tissues. Male mice also may develop septic balanoposthitis secondary to penile selfmutilation. Retrobulbar abscesses caused by S. aureus are frequently noted in athymic mice.",

The prevalence of staphylococcal dermatitis appears to be influenced by host genotype, the overall health of the animal, and the degree of environmental contamination with Staphylococcus spp. C57BL/6, C3H, DBA, and BALB/c mice seem to be the most susceptible strains. Age may also influence susceptibility, with young mice being more susceptible than adults. Immunodeficient mice (e.g., athymic mice) contaminated with staphylococci often develop abscesses or furunculosis (Fig. 43 ). As noted above, behavioral dysfunction resulting in selfmutilation, including scratching and trichotillomania, is a likely predisposing factor. Once virulent staphylococci contaminate the environment, colonization of the gastrointestinal tract can occur and produce a carrier state. Phage typing can help to determine the source of infection.

A recent national survey revealed that more than 30% of barrier colonies and about 70% of conventional colonies were affected (Jacoby and Lindsey, 1997) . The epizootiological impact of pinworm infestation is increased by the airborne dissemination of eggs, which can remain infectious even after drying. The life cycle is direct and completed in 11-15 days. Females deposit their eggs on the skin and hairs of the perianal region. Ingested eggs liberate larvae in the small intestine, and they migrate to the cecum within 24 hr. Worms remain in the cecum for 10-11 days, where they mature and mate. The females then migrate to the large intestine to deposit their eggs as they leave the host. There is unconfirmed speculation that larvae may reenter the rectum. Infestation usually begins in young mice and can recur, but adult mice tend to be more resistant. Syphacia infestation often occurs in combination with Aspicularis tetraptera. Because the life cycle of Syphacia is much shorter than that of Aspicularis, the number of mice that are apt to be infected with S. obvelata is correspondingly greater.

Hairs are parted with pins or sticks and examined with a dissecting microscope. Examination of young mice, prior to the onset of immune-mediated equilibrium, is likely to be more productive. Alternatively, recently euthanized mice can be placed on a black paper, and double-sided cellophane tape can be used to line the perimeter to contain the parasites. As the carcass cools, parasites will vacate the pelage and crawl onto the paper. Sealed petri dishes can also be used. Cellophane tape also can be pressed against areas of the pelt of freshly euthanatized mice and examined microscopically. Skin scrapings made with a scalpel blade can be macerated in 10% KOH/glycerin or im-mersion oil and examined microscopically. This method has the disadvantage of missing highly motile species and low-level populations of slower-moving immature forms. It is important to remember that mite infestations may be mixed, so the identification of one species does not rule out the presence of others. Gross anatomical features facilitate differentiation of intact mites. Myocoptes has an oval profile with heavily chitinized body, pigmented third and fourth legs, and tarsal suckers ( Fig. 51 ). Myobia and Radfordia have a similar elongated profile, with bulges between the legs. Myobia has a single tarsal claw on the second pair of legs (Fig. 52) , whereas Radfordia has two claws of unequal size on the terminal tarsal structure of its second pair of legs (Fig. 53 ).

Vitamin E deficiency can cause convulsions and heart failure, as well as muscular dystrophy and hyaline degeneration of muscles. Deficiency of B complex vitamins produces nonspecific signs such as alopecia, decreased feed consumption, poor growth, poor reproduction and lactation, as well as a variety of neurological abnormalities. Choline deficiency produces fatty livers and nodular hepatic hyperplasia, as well as myocardial lesions, decreased conception, and decreased viability of litters. Folic acid-deficient diets cause marked decreases in red and white cell blood counts and the disappearance of megakaryocytes and nucleated cells from the spleen. Pantothenic acid deficiency is characterized by nonspecific signs, such as weight loss, alopecia, achromotrichia, and posterior paralysis, as well as other neurological abnormalities.

It is most often seen among C57BL/6 and C57BL/10 mice because they are used widely. Initial signs include alopecia and papular dermatitis, which usually occur over the dorsal trunk (Fig. 56) . In severe cases, skin ulceration ensues, which is grounds for euthanasia, while scarring and disfigurement can occur among surviving mice. The cause is unknown. Microbiological assessments have yielded a variety of bacteria that are considered to be secondary opportunists, and acariasis has not been incriminated. Seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of disease suggests that environmental factors may play a role. The incidence appears to increase during periods of significant seasonal changes in temperature and humidity, i.e., the onset of winter and early spring. There is some evidence that incidence is related to diet, with mice on ad libitum diets being more susceptible than those on restricted diets.

Its prevalence in some strains approaches 100%. NZB and NZB X NZW F1 hybrid mice, for example, develop immune complex glomerulonephritis as an autoimmune disease resembling human lupus erythematosus, whereas glomerular disease is relatively mild in NZB mice (NZB mice have a high incidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia). Renal changes occur as early as 4 months of age, but clinical signs and severe disease are not present until 6-9 months. The disease is associated with wasting and proteinurea, and lesions progress until death intervenes. Histologically, glomeruli have proteinaceous deposits in the capillaries and mesangium. Later, tubular atrophy and proteinaceous casts occur throughout the kidney. Immunofluorescence studies show deposits of immunoglobulin and the third component of complement, which lodge as immune complexes with nuclear antigens and antigens of murine leukemia virus in glomerular capillary loops. Mice infected with LCMV or with retroviruses can also develop immune complex glomerulonephritis.",

There are, however, some strains of mice that have been specifically inbred and selected for susceptibility to spontaneous tumors. Leukemogenesis in mice may involve viruses and chemical or physical agents. Viruses associated with lymphopoietic and hematopoietic neoplasia belong to the family Retroviridae (type C oncornaviruses) and contain RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). These viruses are generally noncytopathogenic for infected cells, and mice appear to harbor them as normal components of their genetic apparatus. Although they may be involved in spontaneous leukemia, they are not consistently expressed in this disease. Recombinant viruses have recently been discovered that can infect mouse cells and heterologous cells and are associated with spontaneous leukemia development in high leukemia strains such as AKR mice. Their phenotypic expression is controlled by mouse genotype. Endogenous retroviruses are transmitted vertically through the germ line. Horizontal transmission is inefficient but can occur by interuterine infection or through saliva, sputum, urine, feces, or milk. The leukemia induced by a given endogeous virus is usually of a single histopathological type. Chemical carcinogens, such as polycyclic hydrocarbons, nitrosoureas, and nitrosamines and physical agents such as X-irradiation can also induce hematological malignancies in mice.",
