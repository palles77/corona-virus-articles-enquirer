The lack of benefit reported by two large multi-centre randomised trials [4, 5] prompted two meta-analyses published in 1995 [6, 7] to recommend that short courses of high dose steroids should no longer be used in patients with the sepsis syndrome. Subsequent studies in a sicker septic population, however, reported either survival benefit or reduction in catecholamine requirements with longer courses (\u22655 days) of lower stress doses of corticosteroids (200 to 300 mg hydrocortisone daily equivalent) [8] . This strategic shift to an 'adrenal replacement' dose (albeit the doses chosen will still generate supra-physiological levels) arose from the recognition that relative adrenal insufficiency was a common phenomenon in sepsis and a poor prognostic factor. A rebound increase in plasma cytokine levels at three days [9] prompted the recommendation that the steroid dose should be tailed off rather than stopped abruptly.",

Some have since argued that all septic shock patients should receive corticosteroids regardless of tetracosactrin response on the grounds of lack of harm [12] , whereas others counsel caution in view of the risk of potential adverse events such as myopathy [13] .

At nine months the steroid group showed an absolute risk reduction in mortality of 9.2% over placebo (NNT 11).

HIV infection was associated with higher mortality, but no effect of steroid was seen in this subgroup. Adverse events were lower in the steroid group, particularly those that led to a change in antituberculous therapy, such as drug-induced hepatitis.

The primary endpoint was treatment failure defined as the need for extra or repeated treatment of the exacerbation, or mortality. Steroids reduced this risk (odds ratio 0.48 (CI 0.34 to 0.68), NNT 9) but no difference was seen in mortality. There was improvement in breathlessness, and in measures such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and arterial blood gas tests. Hospital stay was not reduced, possibly due to heterogeneity of discharge policy and co-morbidity. Adverse events were more likely with the number needed to harm being 6 overall, and 13 for hyperglycaemia. A further review confirmed a reduction in treatment failure and also a reduced length of hospital stay [50] . This review suggested that two weeks of steroid therapy was as effective as eight, with less associated infection risk. Long-term inhaled steroids also reduced the risk of acute exacerbation in a subgroup of patients with FEV 1 <2L (RR 0.75 (CI 0.71 to 0.8)) [51] .",

A more detailed consideration of the applicability of steroids can be found in some condition-specific reviews, many of which are cited above. The conditions we have covered range widely in severity, duration, site, and type of causative organism. Furthermore, the dosing and duration of steroid therapy varies enormously between conditions and, as clearly illustrated by steroid use in sepsis, benefit or harm may accrue depending on the regimen used. In many of the conditions listed, only limited data are available. There is an obvious need to have more adequately powered trials to provide definitive evidence of benefit or harm, and a better understanding of how steroids modulate disease processes. ",

A systematic review of randomised, controlled trials in mechanically ventilated infants totalling 140 patients found no significant decrease in the duration of ventilation or hospital admission with systemic dexamethasone [29]. Other trials have shown benefit with steroids, with a reduction in hospital stay in nonventilated infants [30,31], and in the need for hospital admission for children presenting with bronchiolitis to the emergency room [32].Cough and wheeze are common long-term sequelae of bronchiolitis. Nebulised budesonide given early did not significantly affect one-year outcome in 161 infants[33]. No difference was also seen in time to discharge, re-admission rates, survival, or visits from a general practitioner, reflecting findings made by other groups[34,35].The use of inhaled steroid for episodic viral wheeze of childhood did not reduce symptom severity, duration, or the need for hospital admission[36].",
