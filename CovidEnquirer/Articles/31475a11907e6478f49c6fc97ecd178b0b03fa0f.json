Results: Both the RVP and the Respifinder assay have an excellent specificity. Sensitivity was 33% and 78% for the RVP and the Respifinder assay, respectively.

            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a common cause of hospitalization and are caused by various bacterial or viral pathogens. 1 To date, more than 20 viruses have been shown to cause respiratory tract infections and every year new viruses are associated with LRTI. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Studies suggest that an early and accurate identification of a viral etiologic agent during emergency department evaluation or in hospitalized patients has been associated with a decrease in antibiotic use, a decreased number of additional tests performed, a decreased length of stay in the emergency department and a decreased length of hospital stay. [8] [9] [10] [11] Clinical diagnosis of a respiratory tract infection is difficult in patients with atypical illness characteristics and in low prevalence setting. Identification of the etiological agent can be useful if there is a need for a specific therapeutic approach, if hospital hygiene measures are necessary and for epidemiological reasons. 12 Laboratory techniques such as antigen immunoassays, viral culture and serology have several shortcomings such as a limited sensitivity, long turnaround times and limited spectrum of detectable pathogens. 12, 13 A combination of methods is often necessary to improve diagnosis. The use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enables same day detection of causal pathogens and therefore the prompt initiation of appropriate interventions. Multi parameter NAAT allow broad spectrum detection of pathogens, thereby saving time and work. 14 In addition, a study by Brunstein and colleagues reports preliminary clinical evidence that the diagnosis of co-infections is medically relevant and that an effective treatment for severe RTI requires the detection of all involved pathogens. 15 ",

The limited sensitivity can be explained by a limited sensitivity for adenovirus, CoV-NL63, CoV-OC43, CoV-229E, PIV-1, InfA and for weak positive samples. A positive result was found with the Respifinder assay in 74 of 95 samples, which is equivalent with an overall sensitivity of 78%. In general, the false negative results can be explained by the limited sensitivity for weak positive samples. The false positive result for InfA H5N1 could probably be explained by cross-hybridization of a variant of InfA H1N1 with the H5N1 probe. According to the kit insert, the diagnosis of a H5N1 infection may not be based on a positive finding with the Respifinder assay alone.",

Furthermore, the clinical relevance of these weak positive samples remains unclear. A recent study, published by Utokaparch et al. 19 suggests that the total viral load for children with LRTI is significantly increased compared to children with non-LRTI.",

However, these analytical evaluation results can give an indication on the technical performance of both assays. 20 A study on the clinical performance of RVP by Mahony et al. 21 seems to indicate that the RVP has a higher sensitivity (98.5%) compared to direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and culture (68.8%). The sensitivity of the Respifinder compared to cell culture was 100%, except for PIV-3 (80%). 17 Data on the performance characteristics of other commercial multiplex assays show that these assays are more sensitive than viral culture. 22, 23 Only few studies compared the performance of commercially available multiplex assays. A study by Balada-Llasat et al., 23 evaluating the performance of 3 commercial assays for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections in adults showed that, when compared to culture, the RVP had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 91%, compared to MultiCode-PLx (EraGen Biosciences, Madison, WI, US) with 89% and 87% and Resplex II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 89% and 94%, respectively. However, the Resplex II offered the broadest virus detection range and the MultiCode-PLx offered the greater ease of use. Another study 22 seems to indicate that the Respifinder has a better sensitivity than the Seeplex RV12 detection kit (Seegen, Rockville, MD, US).",
