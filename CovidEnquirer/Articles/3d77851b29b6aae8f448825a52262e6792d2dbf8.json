There have been numerous reports on the negative impact of cardiovascular comorbidity on postoperative outcome after pulmonary resection in patients with NSCLC [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 14] . As an endogenous regulator of the RAS, ACE2 plays a crucial role in cardiovascular regulation [10] . In the present study, we provide the first evidence that the serum ACE2 level is associated with postoperative morbidities and mortality after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients. ACE2 is highly expressed in the lungs as a membranebound protein in the vascular endothelium, alveolar epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary vasculature, and bronchial epithelia [15] . Pulmonary ACE2 appears to have a role in regulating the balance of circulating Ang II/ Ang 1-7 levels. Ang II induces pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia, which is important in preventing shunting in patients with lung injury [16] . Locally increased Ang II production also triggers increasing vascular permeability facilitating pulmonary oedema [17] . A recent study suggests that ACE2 protects from severe acute lung failure and COPD, and possibly, pulmonary arterial hypertension [15] . ACE2 protein also appears to be the entry-point receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [18, 19] . In addition, interplay between ACE and ACE2 reportedly plays a pivotal role in the development of tuberculous pleural effusions [20] . Thus, ACE2 appears directly involved in pulmonary vascular regulation as well as in pulmonary infection and pleural effusion. In agreement with the previous studies, we found in the present study that the serum ACE2 level in the lowest quartile was associated with significantly higher rates of pneumonia and pleural effusion after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients.",

            "text": "Pneumonectomy is a common type of pulmonary resection performed in 10%-30% of patients offered curative resection for primary lung cancer. However, despite improvements in operative techniques and postoperative care, pneumonectomy remains a high-risk procedure [22] . In agreement with this, patients undergoing pneumonectomy had higher rates of postoperative morbidities and in-hospital mortality than those undergoing lobectomy/bilobectomy in this study. We found that the serum ACE2 level in NSCLC patients was significantly elevated 24 hours after major pulmonary resection and returned to baseline level on day 3 postoperatively. Therefore, only the serum ACE2 level on postoperative day 1 was used for subsequent hazard ratio and association analyses. The high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in lung cancer patients can be explained with common risk factors such as older age and tobacco consumption [23, 24] . Thus, the hazard ratio analysis was adjusted for age, current smoking status, and a variety of other confounding factors that may affect the incidence of postoperative morbidities and/or serum ACE2 levels, including sex, BMI, FEV1, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and tumour clinical stages. After adjustment for the confounding factors, the risk of developing postoperative morbidities remained significantly higher in the lowest serum ACE2 level quartile than in the highest quartile on postoperative day 1, indicating that the serum ACE2 level one day post surgery is an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients. Thus, the serum ACE2 level one day post surgery could be used as a biomarker or prognostic factor for postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients. In addition, our findings also suggest that supplementing ACE2 could be a potential therapy for preventing or improving postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection. Given the important role of Ang II/ACE2 signalling in pulmonary vascular regulation, pulmonary infection and pleural effusion, and possibly atrial fibrillation [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , an increase of ACE2 after major pulmonary Table 6 Association of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) levels with postoperative morbidities and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing lobectomy/bilobectomy. ACE2 and postoperative morbidity resection, albeit short-lived, may be a critical compensatory mechanism against initiation of early postoperative morbidities, which leads to reduced manifestation of postoperative morbidities and mortality. Further studies are needed to uncover the underlying mechanisms. This study was a prospective study with multiple measurements of the serum ACE2 level, which enabled us to conduct the study in a more controlled manner and thus to generate reliable data. There are several limitations in this study: (1) We only assessed short-term outcomes in this study. Nevertheless, evaluation of long-term survival outcomes is underway with the same patient cohort. (2) This study suggests that the serum ACE2 level one day post surgery could be used as a prognostic factor for postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients, the clinical application value of which still needs to be validated in future studies with a larger patient population. (3) Although the total number of patients undergoing major pulmonary resection was well enough for achieving the study objectives, only a small number of patients underwent pneumonectomy. Thus, in stratified analyses by pneumonectomy and lobectomy, the relatively small sample size of patients undergoing pneumonectomy (n = 35) may not be adequate for achieving results with adequate statistical power. We did not find significant effects of the serum ACE2 level on postoperative morbidities and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing pneumonectomy (n = 35), which was very likely due to an inadequate sample size.",
