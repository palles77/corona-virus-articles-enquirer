            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease of the lung, characterised by progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. 1 COPD is the most common chronic respiratory illness in older adults, affecting an estimated 210 million people worldwide. 2 This condition has a substantial impact on quality-of-life. 2 The Global Burden of Disease Study found COPD to be the third leading cause of death globally and the ninth leading cause of years of life lost due to premature mortality in 2010, 3 accounting for 3.7% of years lived with disability and 3.1% of disability-adjusted life years worldwide. 4, 5 COPD also imposes a substantial socioeconomic burden. In 2001, the total cost of COPD in Europe was reported to be \u20ac38.7 billion. 6 Considerable progress has been made concerning the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical management of COPD in recent years. However, significant challenges remain. Improved understanding of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a key research priority. AECOPD are highly relevant clinically, being a major cause of COPD-related morbidity and mortality, 7-11 as well as accounting for a substantial proportion of the significant social, healthcare and economic burden of COPD. 6 It has been estimated that AECOPD account for approximately 70% of total healthcare costs associated with COPD. 12 Patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II or more disease experience 1 or 2 exacerbations annually. Exacerbation varies from patient to patient with severity of disease. 13 Various triggers for AECOPD have been identified; 1 however, up to 75% of all exacerbations are associated with the detection of bacterial and/or viral respiratory pathogens. 14, 15 Exacerbations associated with detectable respiratory pathogens have been shown to have a more marked impact on 14 With the introduction of new molecular sequencing techniques, the traditional belief that healthy lungs are sterile has been refuted. There is increasing evidence that the lower respiratory tract contains a diverse microbial flora that differs between health and disease. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The presence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the inflamed airways of patients with COPD is well-documented, with up to 50% of patients with stable COPD showing evidence of lower airway bacterial colonisation using traditional culture techniques. 15, 21, 22 In patients with COPD, bacterial detection in lower airway derived samples is associated with increased airway inflammation, reduced lung function and more frequent exacerbations. [23] [24] [25] Acquisition of new pathogen strains also appears to be associated with an increased risk of AECOPD. 15, 21, 26 Estimates of the relative contribution of different pathogens to AECOPD vary. However, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae appears to be the major bacterial pathogen associated with AECOPD, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 14, 15 Respiratory viruses commonly associated with AECOPD include human rhinoviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus and adenovirus. 15 Improved understanding of the role of infectious pathogens in AECOPD may lead to the development of more targeted strategies for treatment and prevention.

The incidence rate of all-cause AECOPD and of AECOPD having sputum containing bacterial pathogens (overall and by bacterial species) will be calculated, with 95% CI. The 95% CI of the incidence rate will be computed using a model which accounts for repeated events, namely the generalised linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution for the response variable with logarithm as link function, and the logarithm of time for follow-up as an offset variable as a preliminary approach. Other flexible approaches to statistical analysis may also be used. In addition, the same model with covariates (e.g. smoking status at enrolment, number of moderate/severe exacerbations reported in the 12 months prior to enrolment, presence of respiratory pathogenic bacteria detected at the exacerbation visit and at previous visits) will be applied. Incidence rates will also be calculated for moderate AECOPD and for severe AECOPD.",

The overall objective of the study will aim at refining the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology of exacerbations. This is of note, since there is currently no commonly agreed definition of AECOPD and no current case definition includes a microbiological endpoint. The impact of AECOPD on health-related quality-of-life and healthcare use will be assessed in order to provide a complete picture of disease burden.

This is important since available data suggest that up to 50% of exacerbations may not be reported to healthcare providers and consequently exacerbation rates are lower in studies employing event-based criteria to define AECOPD. 36 Due to the close daily monitoring of symptoms to identify AECOPD, we anticipate that the exacerbation rate in this study will be higher than previously reported. This close monitoring and early therapeutic intervention at exacerbation may also impact on estimates of the overall burden of disease.",

Improved understanding of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a key research priority. AECOPD are highly relevant clinically, being a major cause of COPD-related morbidity and mortality, 7-11 as well as accounting for a substantial proportion of the significant social, healthcare and economic burden of COPD. 6 It has been estimated that AECOPD account for approximately 70% of total healthcare costs associated with COPD. 12 Patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II or more disease experience 1 or 2 exacerbations annually. Exacerbation varies from patient to patient with severity of disease. 13 Various triggers for AECOPD have been identified; 1 however, up to 75% of all exacerbations are associated with the detection Molecular diagnostic and typing techniques will be used to describe the dynamics of airway infection and its potential association with clinical outcome.

In addition, the same model with covariates (e.g. smoking status at enrolment, number of moderate/severe exacerbations reported in the 12 months prior to enrolment, presence of respiratory pathogenic bacteria detected at the exacerbation visit and at previous visits) will be applied.

The study aims to explore the dynamics of airway infection and its possible contribution to AECOPD, as well as the potential role of chronic colonization in stable disease. The overall objective of the study will aim at refining the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology of exacerbations. This is of note, since there is currently no commonly agreed definition of AECOPD and no current case definition includes a microbiological endpoint. The impact of AECOPD on health-related quality-of-life and healthcare use will be assessed in order to provide a complete picture of disease burden. The interaction between airway infection and systemic manifestations of COPD and nutritional status will also be assessed in detail for the first time. Biological specimens collected during the study may also be used for further disease-related testing, including molecular typing to describe and compare To our knowledge, few other studies have employed real-time electronic tracking of symptoms to identify AECOPD and potential aetiological triggers. This is important since available data suggest that up to 50% of exacerbations may not be reported to healthcare providers and consequently exacerbation rates are lower in studies employing event-based criteria to define AECOPD. 36 Due to the close daily monitoring of symptoms to identify AECOPD, we anticipate that the exacerbation rate in this study will be higher than previously reported. This close monitoring and early therapeutic intervention at exacerbation may also impact on estimates of the overall burden of disease.",

However, it is important to recognise that most of these studies have not included molecular microbiological assessments. Recent large observational studies focusing on biomarker discovery have involved close phenotyping of COPD patients, but have not studied the aetiology of exacerbations in depth. [37] [38] [39] In another study, potentially pathogenic bacterial strains were identified using molecular typing techniques, although viruses as potential airway pathogens were not investigated. 21 More recently, the prevalence and load of airway bacteria in stable and exacerbated AECOPD have been assessed in paired samples from 52 patients participating in the London COPD cohort study using modern molecular techniques. 19 Airway bacterial prevalence and load was found to increase significantly during AECOPD, with quantitative molecular techniques proving more discriminatory than culture. However, assessment was 17, 18, 20, 40, 41 In AERIS, samples will be acquired during both AECOPD and stable disease and analysed for a wide range of potentially pathogenic bacteria and viruses using advanced PCR-based techniques as well as traditional culture-based methods. Numerous other approaches are under investigation for the prevention of AECOPD, including anti-inflammatory drugs, immunomodulatory agents, immunotherapy, antioxidants and non-pharmacologic strategies. Vaccination is another potential approach meriting investigation for reducing AECOPD risk. However, optimal strategies targeting key respiratory pathogens are not yet available to the clinician.",

Exacerbation varies from patient to patient with severity of disease. 13 Various triggers for AECOPD have been identified; 1 however, up to 75% of all exacerbations are associated with the detection of bacterial and/or viral respiratory pathogens. 14, 15 Exacerbations associated with detectable respiratory pathogens have been shown to have a more marked impact on ",

The incidence rate of all-cause AECOPD and of AECOPD having sputum containing bacterial pathogens (overall and by bacterial species) will be calculated, with 95% CI. The 95% CI of the incidence rate will be computed using a model which accounts for repeated events, namely the generalised linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution for the response variable with logarithm as link function, and the logarithm of time for follow-up as an offset variable as a preliminary approach. Other flexible approaches to statistical analysis may also be used. In addition, the same model with covariates (e.g. smoking status at enrolment, number of moderate/severe exacerbations reported in the 12 months prior to enrolment, presence of respiratory pathogenic bacteria detected at the exacerbation visit and at previous visits) will be applied.

The study aims atot exploreing the dynamics of airway infection and its possible contribution to AECOPD, as well as the potential role of chronic colonization in stable disease. The overall objective of the study will aim at refining the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology of exacerbations. This is of note, since there is currently no commonly agreed definition of AECOPD and no current case definition includes a microbiological endpoint. The impact of AECOPD on healthrelated quality-of-life and healthcare use will be assessed in order to provide a complete picture of disease burden. The interaction between airway infection and systemic manifestations of COPD and nutritional status will also be assessed in detail for the first time. Biological specimens collected during the study may also be used for further disease-related testing, including molecular typing to describe and compare 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 To our knowledge, few other studies have employed real-time electronic tracking of symptoms to identify AECOPD and potential aetiological triggers. This is important since available data suggest that up to 50% of exacerbations may not be reported to healthcare providers and consequently exacerbation rates are lower in studies employing event-based criteria to define AECOPD. 36 Due to the close daily monitoring of symptoms to identify AECOPD, we anticipate that the exacerbation rate in this study will be higher than previously reported. This close monitoring and early therapeutic intervention at exacerbation may also impact on estimates of the overall burden of disease.",

However, it is important to recognise that most of these studies have not included molecular microbiological assessments. Recent large observational studies focusing on biomarker discovery have involved close phenotyping of COPD patients, but have not studied the aetiology of exacerbations in depth. [37] [38] [39] In another study, potentially pathogenic bacterial strains were identified using molecular typing techniques, although viruses as potential airway pathogens were not investigated. 21 More recently, the prevalence and load of airway bacteria in stable and exacerbated AECOPD have been assessed in paired samples from 52 patients participating in the London COPD cohort study using modern molecular techniques. 19 Airway bacterial prevalence and load was found to increase significantly during AECOPD, with quantitative molecular techniques proving more discriminatory than culture. However, assessment was pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis). However, other potential pathogens and the overall respiratory microbiome may also contribute and have not yet been studied in detail. 17, 18, 20, 40, 41 In AERIS, samples will be acquired during both AECOPD and stable disease and analysed for a wide range of potentially pathogenic bacteria and viruses using advanced PCR-based techniques as well as traditional culture-based methods.",

The selection of subjects with a history of at least a single exacerbation enriches the cohort to some degree and ensures an adequate number of exacerbations are sampled. It is accepted that some aspects of the analysis may not be generalizable to the subgroup of patients who never exacerbate. The analyses proposed in this study will generate epidemiological data to complement that derived from existing COPD cohorts and further explore determinants of COPD and the contribution of bacterial and viral pathogens to AECOPD, as well as to provide some understanding of the limitations of existing data. As exacerbation visits are triggered by patient diary data, accurate and timely diary completion is essential. All subjects participating in this study receive diary training at enrolment and support is available from the study team at all times to promote accurate and complete diary keeping. Cohort retention is a key factor in the successful delivery of such a study and with in-depth sampling protocols, participant engagement, comfort and feedback are key factors in optimising cohort retention and comprehensive data collection. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Combinations of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids are also used in patients with more severe disease and/or frequent exacerbations.

Improved understanding of the role of respiratory pathogens in AECOPD is required and the use of modern molecular microbiological techniques may lead to insights into host-pathogen interactions and the development of more targeted therapeutic approaches.Methods and analyses: Acute Exacerbation and Respiratory InfectionS in COPD (AERIS) is a prospective longitudinal epidemiological study initiated in the UK to assess how dynamic changes in the COPD airway microbiome contribute to the incidence and severity of AECOPD. COPD patients aged 40-85 years are followed monthly for 2 years, and seen in the clinicreviewed within 72 hours of onset of symptoms of AECOPD. Exacerbations are detected using daily electronic diary cards that subjects complete daily. Blood, sputum, nasopharyngeal and urine samples are collected at pre-specified time-points. Molecular diagnostic and typing techniques are used to describe the dynamics of airway infection during AECOPD and stable disease, and its associations with clinical outcome. This study also aims toat refineing the case definition of AECOPD to reflect the possible microbiological aetiology. of exacerbations. The studyAERIS will also assess the impact of AECOPD on healthrelated quality-of-life and healthcare resource utilisation, as well asand the possible interactions between nutritional status, infection and cellular immune responses. Ethics and dissemination: AERIS is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice GCP guidelines, and has been approved by the relevant institutional ethics and review board. All subjects must provide written . The results obtained will be disseminated by presentations at international medical conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. Discussion: To our knowledge, fFew other studies have addressed the complexity of the microbiological and systemic components of COPD or employed real-time electronic tracking of symptoms to identify AECOPD and potential aetiological triggers. It is anticipated that Rresults of AERIS will significantly increase our understanding of the contribution of bacterial and viral pathogenspathogens to AECOPD, potentially leading to research intonew targeted therapeutic and preventative interventions.

The following outcomes will beare recorded: spirometry, FEV 1 , FVC,FEV 1 /FVC ratio, FEV 1 % predicted, mid expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of the forced vital capacity (MEF25-75), single breath diffusion (transfer factor [TLCO] and rate of carbon monoxide uptake [KCO], and body plethysmography (total lung capacity [TLC], residual volume [RV], vital capacity [VC] and RV/TLC). At the enrolment visit, subjects are asked to refrain from using short-acting bronchodilators for at least 6 hours and long-acting bronchodilators for at least 12 hours before key procedures. Prior to the subsequent follow-up visits, subjects may use their usual medication normally. Lung function measurements are performed under controlled conditions and in the sitting position as per standard practice. Anthropometrics (including but not restricted to height, weight, waist and midarm circumference and triceps skin-fold circumference) are measured quarterly. Grip strength and fatigability are measured using standard techniques. Anthropometric data are used to compute the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score. 30 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",

Nasopharyngeal swabs are collected from all patients at study entry and then from a subcohort of 30 patients at monthly follow-up visits and at exacerbation during the first year of follow-up. Urine samples are collected from all patients at study entry and at exacerbation and from the subcohort of 30 patients at monthly follow-up visits during the first year. Breath samples are collected from approximately 80 patients (including the subcohort of 30 patients providing nasopharyngeal swabs) at monthly follow-up visits and at exacerbation visits during the first year. Blood samples are analysed for disease-related biomarkers, biochemistry, cellmediated immune response, RNA profile and nutrients. Sputum samples are processed by traditional culture techniques and multiplex PCR analysis for identification of potential respiratory pathogens (including, but not limited to, nontypeable H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus).
