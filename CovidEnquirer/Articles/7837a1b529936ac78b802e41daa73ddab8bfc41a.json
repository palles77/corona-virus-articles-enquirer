            "text": "Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results demonstrate that cotranslational folding of this protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding and/ or binding events may also stimulate PRF.",

            "text": "Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to exploit the host machinery in order to increase the coding capacity of their highly constrained genomes. There are at least 27 viral genera that utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) in order to produce multiple proteins from a single transcript (https://viralzone.expasy.org/860). PRF is genetically encoded, and minimally requires a portion of the transcript that contains a repetitive \"slippery\" heptanucleotide sequence (slip-site) followed by a region that forms stimulatory RNA secondary structures (an ensemble of stem loops and/ or pseudoknots). 1, 2 A collision between the translating ribosome and the stimulatory secondary structure increases the kinetic barrier to translocation, which causes the ribosome to dwell on the slip-site. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] During this pause, the t-RNA that is annealed within the ribosomal P-site (and most often also the t-RNA in the A-site) 8 begin to sample alternative base pairing interactions that shift the reading frame of the ribosme. 9 Based on these mechanistic considerations, PRF is typically believed to be mediated at the level of RNA structure. Nevertheless, recent reports have also found that the efficiency of -1PRF can be tuned by a variety of regulatory proteins and/ or miRNA. [10] [11] [12] -1PRF is utilized to temporally and stoichiometrically regulate protein production during viral replication and assembly. For instance, the alphavirus structural proteins are most often produced from a single polyprotein that is cleaved into the capsid (CP), E3, E2, 6K, and E1 proteins ( Figure   1A ). 13 The E2 and E1 proteins are membrane glycoproteins that heterodimerize early in the assembly pathway. These dimeric units then form trimeric spike complexes, traffic to the plasma membrane, and initiate viral budding. 14-16 -1PRF during the translation of the 6K protein gives rise to a secondary form of the polyprotein containing the TransFrame (TF) protein, 13 ,17 a known .

Because -1PRF precludes the translation of E1, the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting (1-48% in alphaviruses) 22 influences the stoichiometric ratio of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins and the net accumulation of spike complexes. Current evidence suggests -1PRF is stimulated by a canonical poly-U slip site and a downstream RNA hairpin. 23 However, an effort to map the stimulatory RNA structures within alphavirus polyproteins revealed that deletions within the predicted hairpin region are capable of reducing the efficiency of -1PRF, but appear to be insufficient to knock out frameshifting completely. 22 This observation suggests there may be multiple regulatory mechanisms that mediate -1PRF within the alphavirus structural polyprotein.",

We first mapped the topology of the Sindbis virus (SINV) structural polyprotein. Our results demonstrate that the structural polyprotein forms two topological isomers. The predominant topology features two TM domains upstream of the -1PRF site, and its formation coincides with production of the 6K protein. Alternatively, the minor topology contains an additional TM domain upstream from the -1PRF site that is linked to the production of TF. Using protein engineering in conjunction with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, we demonstrate that the efficiency of -1PRF is dependent upon the force generated by the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the extra TM domain within the minor topomer. Together, our observations highlight novel connections between the cotranslational folding, biosynthesis, and processing of the alphavirus structural polyprotein. Moreover, our findings reveal a novel mechanism that regulates the overall efficiency of -1PRF.",

            "text": "The current model of the alphavirus structural polyprotein suggests the E2 and 6K proteins each contain two TM domains. 13, 28 However, there are two caveats to this model. First, cryo-EM structures reveal that the E2 protein only contains a single TM domain in the context of the viral envelope. 29, 30 Though it has been speculated that a second TM domain within E2 is somehow extruded from the membrane during processing, the marginal hydrophobicity of this segment also raises the possibility that it may fail to undergo translocon-mediated membrane integration in the first place. Second, the hydrophobic portion of the SINV 6K protein is only 35 residues in length, which is quite short for a segment containing two putative TM domains and a loop. These The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/790444 doi: bioRxiv preprint ambiguous topological signals suggest this portion of the polyprotein is frustrated and could potentially form multiple topological isomers, 31 as has been suggested for the coronavirus E protein. 32 To survey the topological preferences of the E2-6K region, we scanned its sequence using a knowledge-based algorithm that predicts the energetics associated with the transfer of polypeptide segments from the translocon to the ER membrane (\u0394G predictor). 33 Energetic predictions suggest only the regions corresponding to the first hydrophobic segments within the E2 (TM1) and 6K (TM3) proteins are sufficiently hydrophobic to undergo robust membrane integration (\u0394G < 0 kcal/ mol, Fig. 1C ). In contrast, the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the second hydrophobic segment within E2 (TM2) is predicted to be inefficient (Fig. 1C) . To test these predictions, we measured the translocon-mediated membrane integration of each putative TM domain using a glycosylation-based translocation assay. 34 Briefly, the sequences of each putative TM domain were cloned into a chimeric leader peptidase (Lep) reporter protein. 34 Membrane integration of the putative TM segment (purple helix, Fig. 1D ) results in the modification of only a single glycosylation site in Lep, whereas the passage of the segment into the lumen results in the modification of two glycosylation sites (Fig. 1D ). Chimeric Lep proteins were produced by in vitro translation in the presence of canine rough microsomes, which contain native ER membranes and translocons. Consistent with predictions, Lep proteins containing TMs 1 & 3 acquire a single glycosyl modification, which suggests these segments undergo robust translocon-mediated membrane integration (Fig. 1E ). In contrast, the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the second putative TM domain of E2 (TM2) is significantly less efficient (Fig. 1E) Fig. 2A ). It should also be noted that -1PRF only modifies the sequence of the loops downstream from these TM domains (Fig. 1C , orange line), and is therefore unlikely to impact their topological preferences.",

This model correctly places the E2 and E1 ectodomains within the ER lumen, and places the two palmitoylated cysteine residues in E2 (C716 and C718) within the cytosol. 35, 36 To probe the topological preferences of the SINV polyprotein in the cell, we produced and characterized a series of reporter constructs that begin with the E3 protein and end at the C-terminal edge of each of the three putative TM domains within E2 and 6K ( Fig. 2A, Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Each of these fragments was genetically fused to a C-terminal cassette containing a short GS linker and glycosylatable GFP (gGFP) gene, which contains two glycosylation sites within the core of the eGFP protein. 37 Topological signals that direct the gGFP protein into the cytosol will produce a fluorescent gGFP, whereas the glycosylation of gGFP within the ER lumen renders the protein non-fluorescent (Fig. 2B ). Each construct was then expressed in HEK293T cells, and flow cytometry was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of the gGFP reporter at a consistent expression level as judged by the intensity of a bicistronic reporter protein (Supplemental Fig. 2) . Expression of the reporter constructs containing gGFP downstream from Fig. 2A ) generates fluorescent gGFP (Fig. 2C) , which suggests the C-termini of these TM domains reside within the cytosol. In contrast, the reporter construct with gGFP downstream from TM3 (after R785) exhibits an attenuated GFP signal at an equivalent expression level (Fig. 2C) , which suggests the gGFP fused to the C-terminus of TM3 is projected into the ER lumen.

Our model suggests the cluster of unmodified cysteines in the 6K protein (C786, C787, C789, and C790) reside at a C-terminal portion of TM3 that is projected into the ER lumen (Fig. 3A) and is therefore inaccessible to palmitoylating enzymes. However, these same residues are palmitoylated in the TF protein, 25 which suggests the orientation of TM3 must become inverted upon frameshifting in order to expose them to the cytosolic leaflet. Such an inversion could potentially occur as a consequence of the membrane integration of TM2 (Fig. 3B ), which exhibits a weak propensity to undergo translocon-mediated membrane integration (Fig. 1E) . Furthermore, the efficiency associated with the transloconmediated membrane integration of TM2 (~ 20 %, Fig. 1E ) is comparable to the frequency of -1PRF in the SINV polyprotein (~16%). 22 Taken together, these observations potentially suggest a connection between the formation of a secondary topomer and -1PRF.",

To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether mutations that alter the hydrophobicity of TM2 also influence -1PRF. Both energetic predictions and in vitro translation measurements suggest the introduction of two non-native leucine residues into TM2 (T738L & S739L, LL mutant) enhances the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 (predicted \u0394\u0394G = -1.7 kcal/ mol, Supplemental Fig. 3 ). In contrast, the introduction of two glutamate residues into TM2 (V735E & I736E, EE mutant) is predicted to increase its transfer free energy by 3.3 kcal/ mol, which should significantly reduce its membrane integration efficiency (Supplemental Fig. 3A ). The effects of the EE substitutions appear to be subtle in the context of the Lep protein (Supplemental Fig. 3B ), though this likely reflects the limited dynamic range of this translocation assay. 34, 38 Nevertheless, these results clearly show that the LL and EE mutations alter the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2.",

The EE substitutions in TM2 decrease mKate intensity by 61 \u00b1 16% relative to WT (n = 3, Fig. 4A ). In contrast, the LL substitutions increase the mKate intensity by 30 \u00b1 11% (n = 3, Fig. 4A ). It should be emphasized that each of these reporters contain both the native slip-site and stem loop regions, and that these mutations do not alter their sequences. Thus, these findings demonstrate that -1PRF is sensitive to mutations that impact the membrane integration efficiency of TM2. Together, biochemical evidence suggests that TM2 is inefficiently recognized by the translocon (Fig. 1E) , and cellular topology reporters suggest that this segment is most often localized within the cytosol (Fig. 2) . Nevertheless, mutagenesis reveals that the propensity of the nascent chain to form a secondary topomer is positively correlated with -1PRF.

The portion of the transcript containing the EE and LL mutations is over 100 nucleotides upstream from the ribosomal slip site, and should therefore not perturb the stimulatory RNA structures that are currently believed to modulate -1PRF. 2, 22, 23 These mutations instead alter the portion of the nascent chain that falls just outside of the ribosomal exit tunnel during -1PRF, which suggests the nascent chain itself may stimulate frameshifting. Though it has yet to be implicated in ribosomal frameshifting, the cotranslational membrane integration and/ or folding of the nascent chain is known to generate tension on the ribosome. [41] [42] [43] [44] Furthermore, the C-terminal residue of TM2 is positioned 45 residues upstream of the slip site, which corresponds to a distance that should maximize the tension on the nascent chain at the moment the slip site occupies the ribosomal active site. 41, 42 Previous investigations have demonstrated that the force generated by the membrane integration of the nascent chain is sharply dependent upon this spacing. 41, 42 Therefore, to assess the potential role of this force in ribosomal frameshifting, we generated a set of SINV -1PRF reporter constructs (used in Fig. 4A ) containing a series of insertions and deletions that alter the distance between TM2 and the ribosomal slip site (see Supplemental Table 1 ). Reporter constructs were then expressed in HEK293T cells, and -1PRF reporter intensities were quantitatively compared at a uniform expression level by flow cytometry (Supplemental Fig. 5) . A comparison of reporter intensities reveals that -1PRF is maximized at the WT distance of 45 residues (Fig. 4B) . In all cases, deletions and insertions that change the distance between TM2 and the slip site significantly reduce the efficiency of -1PRF (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the insertion of a 10-residue G/S linker decreases the intensity of the frameshift reporter by 76 \u00b1 8% (n = 3), which suggests the membrane integration .

New beads are translated at a rate of 5 amino acids per second, and emerge from the ribosome-translocon complex into an environment with an implicit representation of the bilayer and cytosol (Supplemental Movie 1). 45 These simulations were previously found to sufficiently recapitulate several aspects of cotranslational membrane protein folding including the formation of topological isomers and the generation of tension on the nascent chain. 44, 46, 47 CGMD simulations of SINV polyprotein biosynthesis suggest the nascent chain samples several different topological isomers (Fig. 5A) , and that its topological heterogeneity persists after the polyprotein has cleared the translocon.

In contrast, the EE mutations reduce the pulling force on the nascent chain by an average 2.3 pN relative to WT. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in frameshifting arise from the effects of these mutations on the pulling force on the nascent chain. Simulations of polyprotein variants bearing insertions or deletions that alter the distance between TM2 and the ribosomal slip-site indicate that the native distance (45 residues) is nearly optimal for the transmission of pulling force through the nascent chain (Supplemental Table 1 ), which is consistent with the observed patterns in frameshifting (Fig. 4B) .",

We also provide evidence to suggest this mechanism is likely to be conserved across the alphavirus genus. To date, the mechanistic basis of -1PRF has been generally attributed to the kinetic effects of mechanochemical forces that are generated by structural elements within the mRNA. Indeed, we do find that PRF in the SINV structural polyprotein is dependent upon the RNA stem loop downstream of the slip-site (Supplemental Fig. 6 ). Nevertheless, it is clear that the forces generated by the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 dramatically enhance the frameshifting efficiency. To our knowledge, the findings reported herein constitute the first instance in which forces generated by conformational transitions in the nascent polypeptide chain have been implicated in the efficiency .

Though additional investigations are needed to elucidate how pulling forces in the nascent chain physically stimulate -1PRF, a causative role for tension in both the transcript and nascent chain seems plausible given that ribosomal frameshifting fundamentally arises from the movement of the tRNA with respect to the mRNA. It seems likely that cotranslational folding is one of many regulators, which include both host and viral effectors, that tune the net efficiency of PRF. This creates the potential for mechanistic diversity that could provide an evolutionary benefit for alphaviruses, as -1PRF is rendered tunable by either downstream or upstream mutations that impact the stability of the mRNA hairpin or the conformational ensemble of the nascent chain, respectively. This flexibility could also potentially provide the virus with a means of maintaining desired -1PRF levels in the presence host factors that globally regulate -1PRF through mRNA interactions. 12 It should be noted that the implications of these findings potentially extend beyond the realm of viral proteins. A wide variety of molecular transitions have been found to generate tension within the nascent chain including the folding of soluble domains near the ribosomal exit tunnel 43 and the translocon-mediated membrane integration of nascent TM domains. 40, 41 These observations suggest the tension in the nascent chain should fluctuate as the structural features emerge from the ribosome (Fig. 6A) , which may therefore provide the ribosome with a readout for the progress of cotranslational folding. In the case of the SINV structural polyprotein, the topological frustration within the nascent chain leads to the production of two competing topomers that generate distinct pulling forces on the ribosome in a manner that ultimately impacts the fidelity and processivity of translation ( Fig. 6 B & C) . Additional investigations are needed to explore the potential relevance of this type of cotranslational feedback to protein homeostasis. Indeed, interactions between the .

This could potentially account for the fact that the deletion of components of the ribosome-associated chaperone complex has been found to attenuate -1PRF in yeast. 50 Future investigations are needed to evaluate the full range of -1PRF effectors and how these are potentially exploited for regulatory purposes.",

Despite the significant simplifications involved in this model, the CGMD model has proven accurate in capturing the integration probabilities, topology distributions, and forces experienced in previous studies. 44, 45, 47 In order to obtain the distribution of topologies for various polyprotein mutants, the translation and integration of each sequence was simulated 560 times. In order to reduce computational cost, simulations only included the first three TMDs of the alphavirus polyprotein. In order to focus on the topological preferences of TM2, restraints were applied to enforce that TM1 adopts its native topological orientation. Pulling force measurements were performed by pausing translation when the -1PRF site resides within the ribosomal peptidyl transfer center. During this pause, the final bead was fixed in place and the force on the bead exerted by the nascent chain was measured along the translocon channel axis. Due to the truncation of the exit tunnel in our model, the final bead corresponds to the amino acids 27 residues N-terminal of the -1PRF site.

            "text": ",45 Briefly, simulations are carried out in the context of a coarsened representation of the ribosome exit tunnel, Sec translocon, and nascent chain. The nascent chain is composed of beads that each represent three amino acids, and new beads are sequentially added to the nascent chain in order to explicitly simulate translation. Translation occurs at a rate of 5 aa/s, which mimics the rate of translation by eukaryotic ribosomes. Each bead interacts with the translocon, ribosome, and other beads in a manner that is dependent on the hydrophobicity and charge of its composite amino acids. Interactions with the solvent and lipid bilayer are modelled implicitly. The ribosome and Sec translocon are fixed in place, with the exception of the lateral gate of the translocon, which stochastically switches between the open and closed conformations in a manner dependent on the free energy difference between the two configurations. The geometries of the ribosome and translocon are based on cryo-EM structures. 52 Residuespecific interactions have been parameterized based on over 200 \u00b5s of simulations with the MARTINI forcefield. Fitting is performed using a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework. 53 This approach represents an update relative previous published methodology, and the new parameters utilized herein are included in SupplementalTable 2.

A) Representative snapshots from CGMD simulations are shown during translation at the slip-site, which is the point during elongation at which pulling forces on the nascent chain are measured. The ribosomal exit tunnel is shown in brown. The translocon is shown in gray and its lateral gate is highlighted in green. The nascent chain is shown in blue, except for the portions that correspond to TMs 1 & 2, which are highlighted in orange and red, respectively. The snapshot on the left depicts a representative trajectory in which TM2 passes through the lateral gate and into the membrane. The snapshot on the right depicts a representative trajectory in which TM2 fails to enter the translocon.

Cartoons depict the manner in which the translocon-mediated membrane integration of the nascent chain generates a fluctuation in pulling force that triggers PRF during synthesis of the SINV structural polyprotein. A) The pulling force generated by the transloconmediated membrane integration of each TM domain generates a pulling force on the nascent chain that is maximized during the conjugation of the amino acid that lies ~45 residues upstream of the C-terminal residue of the TM domain. B) The translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 is marginally efficient, which results in the formation of two topologies during translation of the SINV polyprotein. TM2 most often fails to undergo translocon-mediated membrane integration, which results in the formation of a topology featuring only two TM domains (TMs 1 & 3) in the form of the polyprotein containing the 6K protein. However, the translocon-mediated membrane integration of TM2 generates an alternative topology in the frameshifted form of the polyprotein containing the TF protein.
