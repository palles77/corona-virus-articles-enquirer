Turkey coronavirus was partially purified from infected intestine of turkey embryo by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and RNA was extracted. The N protein gene was amplified from the extracted RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The recombinant expression construct (pTri-N) was identified by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Expression of histidine-tagged fusion N protein with a molecular mass of 57 kd was determined by Western blotting analysis. By chromatography on nickel-agarose column, the expressed N protein was purified to near homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The protein recovery could be 2.5 mg from 100 ml of bacterial culture. The purified N protein was recognized by antibody to TCoV in Western blotting assay. The capability of the recombinant N protein to differentiate positive serum of turkey infected with TCoV from normal turkey serum was evident in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). These results indicated that the expressed N protein is a superior source of TCoV antigen for development of antibody-capture ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV.",

The clinical signs usually appear at 7-28 days of age and include inappetence, wet droppings, ruffled feathers, decreased weight gain, growth depression, and uneven flock growth.

The N protein is abundantly produced in coronavirus-infected cells and is highly immunogenic. The N protein binds to the viral genomic RNA and composes the structural feature of helical nucleocapsid. The complete sequence of TCoV N gene was recently obtained in this laboratory (Akin et al., 2001) . The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of TCoV N gene shared high (>90%) similarity with those of infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) N gene (Boursnell et al., 1987) .",

The N protein gene of TCoV had been expressed in baculovirus system recently (Breslin et al., 2001) . A complicate and competitive ELISA was demonstrated with this baculovirus-expressed N protein (Guy et al., 2002) . However, the expression level of the cell culture-based baculovirus system is usually lower than that of prokaryotic system and the purity of this recombinant N protein was not clear. It is cheaper and more convenient to prepare large amount of pure recombinant protein in prokaryotic system. In addition, the antigenic integrity of N protein expressed in prokaryotic system is expected to be maintained because it is not glycosylated. The complete sequence of TCoV S and M genes has not been reported. The purpose of the present study was to express TCoV N gene with a prokaryotic expression system for preparation of large quantities of highly purified viral protein, which can be used as coating antigen for development of Ab-capture ELISA for serologic diagnosis of TCoV infection.",

Turkey coronavirus N protein gene was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with these two primers NF and NR. The amplified product containing the entire open reading frame (1,230 bp) was digested with Nco I and Kpn I and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The digested TCoV N gene fragment was purified and cloned to Nco I and Kpn I sites of plasmid pTriEx-1 (Novagen, Madison, WI). The pTriEx expression system allows the expression of recombinant N protein with a six histidine-tagged sequence on the C-terminal end. The construct was transformed to competent Escherichia coli strain Origami (DE3)pLacI (Novagen). Transformants were grown in LB medium containing 100 g/ml ampicillin, 34 g/ml chloramphenicol, and 1% glucose.
