            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important disease to pork producers worldwide. Commercially, both live and killed PRRSV vaccines are available to control PRRS, but they are not always successful. Based on the results of mucosal immunization studies in other viral models, a good mucosal vaccine may be an effective way to elicit protective immunity to control PRRS outbreaks. In the present study, mucosal adjuvanticity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) was evaluated in pigs administered a modified live PRRS virus vaccine (PRRS-MLV) intranasally. A Mtb WCL mediated increase in the frequency of NK cells, CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, and \u2425\u2426 T cells in pig lungs were detected. Importantly, an increased and early generation of PRRSV specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL compared to pigs inoculated with vaccine alone. In addition, there was an increased secretion of Th1 cytokines (IFN\u2425 and IL-12) that correlated with a reciprocal reduction in the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGF\u2424) as well as T-regulatory cells in pigs vaccinated with PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL. Further, a complete rescue in arginase levels in the lungs mediated through Mtb WCL was observed in pigs inoculated with PRRS-MLV. In conclusion, Mtb WCL may be a potent mucosal adjuvant for PRRS-MLV in order to potentiate the anti-PRRSV specific immune responses to control PRRS effectively.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important chronic viral diseases of pigs [1] . The causal organism of this disease is PRRS virus (PRRSV), which belongs to the family Arteviridae in the order Nidovirales [2] . The clinical signs of PRRS are reproductive failure, abortion, and high pre-weaning mortality [3] . PRRSV causes immunosuppression resulting in susceptibility of pigs to other poly-microbial infections [4, 5] . The virus induces weak, innate immune responses as a result of reduced IFN-\u2423 production and dampened natural killer (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity [5, 6] , which lead to a weak/delayed adaptive immune response. Although increased PRRSV specific antibodies are generated early post-infection, virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies appear quite late and remain at low levels [7] . A killed PRRSV vaccine is available but it has failed to provide adequate protection. A modified-live PRRS virus vaccine (PRRS-MLV) has been in use to control clinical PRRS in young pigs. Unfortunately, like the PRRSV infection, PRRS-MLV also induces delayed neutralizing antibody and dampened cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, it is important to improve the efficacy of PRRSV live vaccines to control PRRS effectively.",

The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 produced by myeloid cells initiates the virus specific adaptive immune response [11] . Additionally, the CMI response is manipulated by the metabolism of an essential amino acid, l-arginine, whose level in the body is modulated by the enzymes arginase (1 and 2) and nitric oxide synthase [12] . The role of arginase in viral infections of the respiratory tract or in vaccination is limited, however, arginase 2 deficient mice have an increased susceptibility to viral infections [13] . The requirement of arginase to abort the multiplication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been reported [14] . In contrast, uncontrolled replication of Leishmania was correlated with enhanced arginase activity [15] .",

Therefore, effective mucosal vaccination is an appropriate strategy to provide protection against various infectious agents. Protective mucosal immunity is mediated by CD4 + T helper (Th) cells, CD8 + cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and NK cells in HSV genital infections [17] . Similarly, intranasal delivery of an influenza vaccine FluMist (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) provided immunity comparable to that induced by a natural infection [18, 19] . An added advantage of mucosal vaccination is that it can induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses [20] . Intranasal immunization of HIVliposome resulted in an effective virus specific immune response at both mucosal and systemic sites [21] .",

            "text": "To increase the efficacy of mucosal immunization, a potent adjuvant or delivery system is needed to overcome the immune tolerant mechanisms at mucosal sites [22, 23] . Mucosal administration of a live attenuated vaccine with a suitable adjuvant induces long lasting protection in various studies performed in bovine herpes virus-1, influenza, and parainfluenza-3 virus [24] [25] [26] . Killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an excellent candidate adjuvant used in the preparation of Freund's complete adjuvant [27] , but its use in humans and in food animals is contraindicated due to a severe granulomatous inflammatory reaction induced at the injection site. This adverse effect results from toxic cell wall components of Mtb (such as mycolic acids, arabinogalactan, wax D) [28, 29] . However, adjuvanticity of various purified components of Mtb have been evaluated individually with satisfactory results [30, 31] . In particular, certain individual components and a total fraction of whole cell lysate (WCL) of Mtb free from its toxic cell wall constituents have been demonstrated to possess superior adjuvanticity in rodents, guinea pigs, and rabbits [32] [33] [34] [35] . However, the knowledge related to mucosal adjuvanticity of Mtb WCL to protect against viral infections of the respiratory tract is limited.",

Initially, we performed studies in pigs to choose a suitable bacterial candidate to use as a mucosal adjuvant by inoculating nine different bacterial preparations belonging to Mycobacterium, Vibrio, and Streptococcus species intranasally; the detailed results of which will be presented elsewhere. From that study, we selected Mtb WCL for its potent adjuvant properties such as its ability to augment PRRSV specific Th1 cytokines and immune cells, and suppress immunosuppressive responses. In this study, immune responses of pigs administered PRRS-MLV+/\u2212 Mtb WCL intranasally were evaluated at both mucosal and systemic sites.",

Here we report that pigs vaccinated intranasally with PRRS-MLV had signif- icantly reduced intracellular arginase levels in their lungs at PID 60 compared to physiological levels from the mock pigs. In contrast, arginase levels in pigs administered PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL were completely rescued. Interestingly, the rescue was significantly higher than in pigs inoculated with PRRS-MLV at PID 30 and 60 (Fig. 6 ). Repeated analysis of arginase from pigs receiving PRRS-MLV+/\u2212 Mtb WCL at all the PID was also statistically significant with reference to increase or decrease in lung arginase levels, respectively (Fig. 6) . Three mock-inoculated and nine pigs each inoculated with PRRS-MLV or PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL intranasally were euthanized on PID 15, 30 or 60 (n = 3 pigs at each PID), and lymphoid cell subsets were enumerated by flow cytometry. a CD3 + and CD3 \u2212 cells were gated to enumerate CD4 and CD8\u2423 expression. b CD25 + cells were gated to enumerate CD4 and Foxp3 expression and the percent of total CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + cells are shown.

We detected an increased frequency of NK cells in PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL inoculated pigs; however, the NK cell frequency was comparable to mock pigs in PRRS-MLV alone received pigs. These findings suggest that PRRSV modulates NK cell function rather than its frequency in pig lungs. NK cells play two major roles in antiviral defense such as secretion of cytokines (predominantly IFN-\u2425), and lysis of infected and transformed cells. PRRSV infection suppresses the NK cell cytotoxic function in pigs [5] . In a recent study, 25 pigs experimentally infected with a PRRSV showed approximately a 50% reduction in their NK cell killing function just two days post-infection (Dwivedi and Renukaradhya 2011, unpublished data) . Now we report that PRRS-MLV delivered intranasally also suppresses the NK cell cytotoxic function; however, when PRRS-MLV was administered with Mtb WCL, an increased frequency with moderate rescue in their function was observed. Enhanced production of theTh1cytokine IL-12 in the lungs of PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL inoculated pigs was detected early (PID 7 and 15). IL-12 is critical for augmenting the innate NK cell function and is responsible for the induction of protective mucosal immunity against intracellular pathogens [9, 54] . Direct NK-DCs crosstalk in mucosally vaccinated animals with adjuvant resulted in enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses [55] .",

It has been demonstrated that PRRSV infection induces a polyclonal activation of B cells in pigs [4, 58] , leading to generation of non-neutralizing as well as auto-antibodies [59] . Also in PRRSV-MLV administered pigs, enhanced production of non-neutralizing antibodies directed mainly to PRRSV-nucleocapsid protein (internal viral protein), and also antibodies directed to anti-decoy neutralizing epitopes of the virus was detected [7, 57] . In contrast, our study shows a reduction in the total PRRSV specific antibodies with increased VN titers mediated by Mtb WCL to PRRS-MLV. Generation of antibodies against mucosal pathogens and soluble protein antigens is dependent on CD4 + Th cells [60, 61] . Consistent with that information, a polarized Th1-based response mediated via CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and enhanced secretion of Th1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected in PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL inoculated pigs. Generally, the Th1 and Th2 immune responses mutually suppress each other when either of one is significantly upregulated. Therefore, our results clearly suggest that the mucosal adjuvant Mtb WCL suppressed the secretion of PRRSV specific non-neutralizing antibodies and at the same time promoted the secretion of neutralizing antibodies critical for PRRSV clearance.",

In our study, at an early time point (PID 7), significantly increased secretion of IL-6 mediated through Mtb WCL was detected in pig lungs. Associated with that finding, there was a significant increase in the myeloid cell population (CD172 + ) in TBLN of pigs vaccinated with PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL. As a lymphoid organ, TBLN is a site where sensitization and activation of immune cells take place; therefore, increased frequency of myeloid cells in TBLN might indicate the Mtb WCL-mediated initiation of the CMI response.",

A physiological level of arginase is essential in the body as arginase knockout mice die by 2 weeks after birth [76] . Glutamine is an important fuel for lymphocytes and macrophages, and plasma glutamine is decreased in HIV infected individuals, where a decrease in the levels of glutamine impairs lymphocyte function [77] . The amino acid proline promotes the growth and differentiation of B-cells and also NK cell activity [78, 79] . Therefore, one of the immune dysregulation mechanisms of PRRSV in pig lungs appears to be mediated through downregulation of arginase, because reduced intracellular arginase was detected in pigs inoculated intranasally with PRRS-MLV. Therefore, mucosal immunization with Mtb WCL has the potential to rescue an important molecular mechanism mediated by the enzyme arginase in pigs vaccinated with PRRS-MLV. Considering the modulation of function of arginase by PRRS-MLV, the direct role of arginase on anti-PRRSV specific mucosal immunity needs to be investigated in detail.",

This adjuvant has the ability to potentiate innate, humoral, and CMI responses by modulating both cellular and molecular mechanisms required for generation of anti-PRRSV specific protective immunity. Further, in continuation of this study, adjuvanticity of Mtb WCL was also confirmed in post-challenge studies which detected a cross-protective immunity to a genetically variant PRRSV MN184 [80] . Considering the fact that PRRS-MLV by itself has the ability to reduce PRRSV viremia and is capable of providing partial protection, it may be a fruitful approach to use this vaccine along with Mtb WCL intranasally. The ability of Mtb WCL to overcome immunosuppression and to augment the virus specific CMI response opens up new avenues to explore its mucosal adjuvanticity against other viral infections.",
