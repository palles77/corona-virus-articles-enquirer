It is caused by Brucella, a small, slow growing, intracellular Gram-negative coccobacillus that is transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals or intake of contaminat-ed raw animal products, such as unpasteurized milk [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] . Brucellosis almost always causes fever, which may be associated with night sweats [5, 8] . Common treatment includes doxycycline and aminoglycosides, although complicated cases, such as brucellosis combined with endocarditis, osteoarticulitis, or neurobrucellosis, may require stronger medicatinos administered for a longer duration [9] [10] [11] . Brucellosis is endemic to the Mediterranean basin, the Persian gulf, India, ",

It has lately also been found in some Central Asian countries, such as Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan. The spread of the disease is attributed to increasing travel between affected countries [13] . The first case of brucellosis in Korea was reported in 2002 [14] . Until now, the major mode of transmission of brucellosis remains unclear. However, brucellosis of Korea seem to be transmitted through close contact with blood, fetus, urine, and placenta of domestic cow that has been infected by B. abortus, or inhalation of B. arbortus while examining or slaughtering cow [15] . This case report details the first incidence of B. melitensis imported to Korea from a patient who recently visited Iraq that resulted in brucellosis and infective spondylitis. In this international era, brucellosis in Korea is no longer limited to B. abortus. In the future, more cases of imported brucellosis are expected due to the fact that many Korean businesses are located in the Middle East, leading to increased exposure to pathogens endemic to this area.",
