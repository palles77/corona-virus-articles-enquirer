For influenza and other viruses there is evidence that viral load and persistence are associated with certain clinical outcomes but it is not known if there is an association between viral load and hospital length of stay. Methods: 306 adults hospitalised with viral acute respiratory illness were studied. Associations between viral load and length of stay were examined. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to control for age, comorbidity, influenza vaccine status, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial co-infection, clinical group and virus subtype. Results: High viral load was associated with a longer duration of hospitalisation for all patients (p < 0.0001). This remained significant across all virus types and clinical groups and when adjusted for age, comorbidity, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, bacterial coinfection and other factors. Conclusions: High viral loads are associated with prolonged hospital length of stay in adults with viral acute respiratory illness. This further supports existing evidence demonstrating that viral acute respiratory illness is a viral load driven process and suggests that viral load could be used in clinical practise to predict prolonged hospitalisation and prioritise antivirals.",

            "text": "Viral load is strongly associated with length of stay in adults hospitalised with viral acute respiratory illness Introduction Acute respiratory tract infections are responsible for a huge burden of disease and are the third most common cause of death worldwide. 1 Although bacteria have previously been considered to be the principal aetiological agents of severe respiratory infection, the global importance of respiratory viruses in this group has been increasingly recognised in recent years. 2e8 There were around 400,000 hospital admissions with acute respiratory infection in England in 2014, 9 excluding exacerbations of chronic lung disease, and recent studies have shown that respiratory viruses are detectable in around 40e50% of hospitalised adults with acute respiratory illness. 4, 10 For influenza virus, human challenge models have demonstrated that viral load, as measured by viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on upper respiratory tract samples, is correlated with symptom severity and the magnitude of the host inflammatory response. 11e13 For hospitalised adults with severe and complicated seasonal influenza viral load is highest at the point of hospitalisation 14 and is higher, with more protracted shedding, compared with outpatients. 14 In addition, the time to viral clearance is related to certain clinical outcomes in this group, including length of hospital stay. 14, 15 In hospitalised patients with the virulent avian H5N1 influenza A, who generally have life threatening disease, the pharyngeal viral load on admission to hospital is higher than in patients with seasonal influenza 16 and is higher in non-survivors versus those who survive. 17 For the other respiratory viruses there are also data in adults to suggest a relationship between viral load and clinical outcomes. In a human challenge model using healthy adult volunteers, RSV nasal viral load is closely correlated with clinical symptoms and recovery. 18 Observational studies have shown that RSV viral load is higher and viral shedding more protracted in hospitalised adults compared to outpatients, 19 and that a high viral load in hospitalised adults is a risk factor for the development of complications including respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. 20, 21 In human challenge models of asthma and COPD exacerbation, using challenge with rhinovirus, viral load measured in sputum correlates with the degree of host inflammatory response. 22, 23 In addition, a study involving healthy university students with naturally acquired rhinovirus infection demonstrated lower viral loads in individuals with asymptomatic rhinovirus detection compared to individuals with symptomatic colds. 24 The most appropriate end-points for clinical trials of respiratory virus antivirals in hospitalised adults have not been agreed. As antiviral drugs work by inhibiting viral replication and available evidence suggests that virological and clinical outcomes are closely correlated, virological end-points have been suggested and used as primary outcome measures for antiviral trials. 17 Additional studies to further characterise the details of the relationship between clinical and virological outcomes in hospitalised adults are therefore required.",

Length of hospital stay is the key determinant of cost in patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness 26 and so represents an outcome measure which is both clinically and economically important. For this reason it is often employed as a primary or secondary outcome measure in clinical trials in hospitalised patients. Although affected by factors other than acute illness such as patient age and comorbidity, and variations in practice between different centres, providing these can be adequately controlled for hospital length of stay represents a useful and robust clinical outcome measure. It has been suggested that prolonged hospitalisation (e.g. >5e7 days) could be used as a clinical end-point for future trials of influenza antivirals in addition to other rarer clinical events such as ICU admission and death. 17 Defining the relationship between viral load and length of hospital stay is therefore of significant interest and importance.",

The multivariable model controlled for age, sex, comorbidity, influenza vaccine status, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation, presence of bacteria, clinical group (exacerbation of asthma, exacerbation of COPD, community acquired pneumonia and influenza-like illness/bronchitis) and virus subtype (Influenza A and B, Rhino/enterovirus and other viruses); these covariates were identified a priori. A zero-truncated model was chosen due to the fact that duration of hospitalisation could not be less than one day; negative binomial regression was chosen due to overdispersion of the outcome, suggesting Poisson regression was not appropriate.

This was a consistent finding across all clinical groups and all virus subtypes and was maintained when adjusting for age, comorbidity, duration of illness, bacterial co-infection and other potentially confounding factors. Our results support the existing body of evidence suggesting that respiratory viruses may cause severe acute respiratory illness and that the resulting clinical illness is a viral load driven process with clinical outcomes predicted by viral load magnitude, kinetics and persistence. Whilst there is already a substantial body of evidence suggesting a relationship between certain clinical outcomes and viral load for influenza and some other respiratory viruses, this is the first study to demonstrate an association between viral load and hospital length of stay and to show a relationship for multiple clinical groups and across multiple viral subtypes within the same study. Our findings suggest that the detection of a high nasopharyngeal viral load in an adult patient hospitalised with acute respiratory illness could be used clinically to identify patients at high risk of prolonged hospitalisation. Although currently most laboratories test for influenza using realtime PCR and so generate Ct values routinely, these are not generally available to clinicians or used for clinical decision making. This study suggest that these results could be passed on to clinicians and used to inform clinical decision making including the priority use of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza and antivirals for other viruses when they become available.",

This suggests that in contrast to healthy adults with uncomplicated viral infection (where viral load peaks quickly and declines rapidly) for hospitalised adults with complicated respiratory viral illness, the viral load remains an important determinant of clinical outcome at this later time point and is therefore potentially modifiable with effective antiviral therapy. This is consistent with a number of observational studies of hospitalised adults with influenza showing reduction in viral loads and clinical benefits from neuraminidase inhibitors even when started beyond 48 h of symptom duration. 14, 29, 30 Although not explored in this study a high viral load is also suggestive of increased infectiousness and an increased risk of nosocomial spread and so patients with a high viral load detected on admission to hospital would represent a priority group for side room isolation and enhanced infection control practices.",

This study strengthens this position and extends it to patients with other respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus and to patients in specific, less well studied clinical groups such as exacerbation of asthma and COPD. Furthermore this study suggests that high viral load could be used as a method to stratify patients in future trials of novel candidate antivirals agents where duration of hospitalisation is used as an outcome measure. The strengths of our study include the large numbers of patients with confirmed viral acute respiratory illness, the consistency of the PCR methods for all patients and the use of multiple logistic regression analysis to adjust for confounding variables such as age, comorbidity, duration of illness prior to hospitalisation and bacterial coinfection. In addition no patients with influenza were treated with neuraminidase inhibitors in our cohort which is consistent with UK prescribing practice at the time of the study and prior to the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, and allows a unique opportunity to examine the associations between viral load and clinical outcomes in untreated patients with influenza without confounding from antiviral treatment.",

            "text": "Although this is a large 'real world' clinical study, and as such is generalizable to typical adult patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness, it does have several limitations. Retrospective observational studies are prone to bias and although this has been well controlled for using our multivariate model, including variables known to potentially influence hospital length of stay, we cannot exclude the possibility of other unpredicted and unmeasured variables influencing the results. The findings of this study are however biologically plausible and are consistent with previously published studies demonstrating a relationship between viral load and clinical outcomes. Furthermore the association seen in our study between high viral load and increased severity of influenza pneumonia using the CURB65 score suggests that high viral load is indeed a marker of severity in patients hospitalised with acute viral respiratory illness. We did not use a formal quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay in this study and instead relied on the semi-quantitative Ct value from our real-time PCR assays. Real-time PCR Ct values are now considered by many to be a robust surrogate for quantified viral load and are increasingly reported in published studies of acute viral illness including those examining respiratory viruses 6, 31 and also in the recent Ebola virus pandemic. 32, 33 Furthermore, the use of protocolised sampling techniques, processing by dedicated research staff and the removal of inter-operator variability of results interpretation (as all samples were analysed by the same scientists in the same laboratory) gives reassurance as to the robustness of the Ct result in this study. Although all patients had respiratory swabs taken from the nasopharynx, as is standard clinical practise when testing for respiratory viruses in the UK, this site may be insensitive for the detection of respiratory viruses in some patients with lower respiratory tract infection. 34 Some studies have found increased rates of respiratory virus detection from sputum compared to upper respiratory tract samples 34, 35 and so it is possible that some of our patients that were excluded due to negative PCR on nasopharyngeal samples may have actually had detectable viruses in their lower respiratory tract. It is also possible that when viruses are detected from both upper and lower respiratory samples that the viral load might be different between the two. We would suggest that the findings of this study are validated in a large prospective cohort incorporating sampling from the upper and lower respiratory tract and examining viral kinetics and persistence over the course of hospitalisation.",

Note: For each unit decrease in Ct value (i.e. increase in viral load), there is a 6% increase in expected days in hospital. Likewise, for each additional year of age, length of stay increases by 2%.
