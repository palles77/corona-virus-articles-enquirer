Although human leukocytes could be isolated from the spleen of mock-infected mice during the 2-weeks experiment, the proportion of engrafted human leukocytes in mice infected with MV (10 3 -10 5 pfu) or rMV-E1E2 (10 4 pfu) was decreased. Viral infection of the splenocytes was confirmed by the development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in cocultures of splenocytes and B95a cells and verified using RT-PCR. Finally, human antibodies against MV were more frequently observed than E2-specific antibodies in serum from mice infected with a low dose of virus (MV, 10 0 -10 1 pfu, and rMV-E1E2, 10 1 -10 2 pfu). These results showed the possibility of hu-PBL-NOJ mice for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of viral proteins.",

Despite prevention efforts and advanced treatment strategies, including combined PEGylated alpha interferron (PEGIFN-\u2423) and ribavirin therapy [6, 7] , the clinical efficacy of this treatment is limited [8, 9] . Alternative novel antiviral agents that have been shown to elicit effective responses in chronically infected patients, such as inhibitors of viral protease, helicase, and polymerase, are currently being developed but are expensive [10] . Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine that either induces the production of high-titer, long-lasting, and cross-reactive neutralising antibodies or induces a cellular immune response is important.",

            "text": "Immunological approaches to control HCV infection have proven to be ineffective, in part because HCV adapts to escape from the host immune system [11] . Furthermore, a high percentage of immunocompetent individuals are infected by HCV despite their ability to mount an active immune response [12] . A preventive HCV vaccine is required to protect unexposed individuals from HCV infection. This vaccine will most likely need to target the viral envelope glycoprotein, E1 and E2, and must also be bivalent, safe, and provide long-lasting protective immunity. To address this challenge, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a live-attenuated recombinant vector derived from the pediatric measles virus (MV) that expresses HCV antigens. The MV vaccine is a well-known, live-attenuated vaccine and has proven to be one of the safest, most stable, and effective human vaccines [13] . This vaccine is produced on a large scale in many countries and used at low cost through the Extended Program on Immunisation of the WHO [14, 15] . While this vaccine has been shown to induce life-long immunity with a single dose, boosting is effective. Efforts to develop vaccines using recombinant MV expressing different proteins derived from dengue virus [16, 17] , human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [18] [19] [20] [21] , Human papilloma virus (HPV) [22] , Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [23] , or West Nile virus (WNV) [24] have been described. We constructed a recombinant MV expressing the E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins of HCV (rMV-E1E2) [25] and demonstrated that this virus could infect B95a cells and express HCV E1.",

This mouse develops all human lymphoid cell lineages that repopulate the animal's lymphoid organs. Our group previously generated the non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID/Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) knockout (NOJ) mouse model and then established a human hemolymphoid system in this mouse [26, 27] . In this study, we infect human PBL-transplanted NOJ mice with MV and rMV-E1E2 and then characterise the humoral immune responses elicited by the transplanted human cells, in order to evaluate rMV-E1E2 as a vaccine candidate.",

In this study, we examined the infectivity of a rescued Edmonston B strain of MV and a recombinant rMV-E1E2 that was constructed using reverse genetics [25, 30] . We demonstrate that these viruses can infect hu-PBL-NOJ mice. This is the first report demonstrating that rescued virus, including a recombinant virus, can infect hu-PBL-NOJ mice. Furthermore, an adequate viral titer could control the generation of antibodies in these mice. Based on the flow cytometry data, most of the human leukocytes disappeared following infection with high virus titer (10 3 -10 4 pfu) and human antibody was not detected in these mice (data not shown). In contrast, a population of human leukocytes was detected in the mice that were inoculated with a lower dose of virus (10 0 -10 2 pfu). In addition, we could detect human antibodies in the serum of mice that were infected with a low dose of virus, suggesting that this viral titer range is suitable for the induction of an antibody response that targets rMVs in the hu-PBL-NOJ mouse system. This range of virus concentration is adequate for antibody production and the resulting antibody response might suppress the viral growth of 10 0 -10 1 pfu MVs in hu-PBL-NOJ mice.",

There have been several reports detailing the infection of experimental transgenic mice that expresses human CD46 and CD150 with some strains of measles virus [35, 36] . However, unlike in other animal models, a population of human cells is the target of the virus in this study. Furthermore, the use of hu-PBL-NOJ mice allows one to monitor the immune response that is generated by human leukocytes against the immunogen. Based on our results, hu-PBL-NOJ mice should be a useful tool for studying the immune response during early MV or rMV-E1E2 infection. Since there is no animal model of HCV infection, monitoring the immune response of human leukocytes permits the accurate evaluation of potential vaccine candidates.",
