The diagnosis of AMG was based on clinical signs compatible with the disease and an abnormal serum anti-AChR antibody concentration. Serum anti-AChR antibody concentration was measured by immunoprecipitation radioimmunoassay using a feline-specific antigen with a diagnostic value of 0.3 nmol/L. 9 All imaging studies of the thorax were interpreted by a board-certified veterinary radiologist. Criteria used for exclusion were the presence of an identifiable CMM on thoracic imaging or administration of methimazole or carbimazole. The wheelbarrow exercise stress test (WEST) was employed during the neurological examination of some cats in an attempt to evaluate their degree of skeletal muscle strength and tolerance to exercise. This test involved elevating and supporting the caudal half of the body while moving the cat forward thereby promoting ambulation through the thoracic limbs (Video S1).",

The WEST was employed in an attempt to induce or exacerbate any skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability, particularly in cats with vague clinical signs. In the present study, 5 of the 6 cats evaluated demonstrated skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability progressing to exhaustion within 1 minute of this activity and were not able to resume normal ambulation until a short period of rest (Video S1). This included 1 cat in which neuromuscular disease was uncertain from the neurological examination as the only abnormality was intermittent appendicular skeletal muscle tremors. Upon performing the WEST, it became apparent that the cat was intolerant to exercise and that the appendicular skeletal muscle tremors might have represented appendicular skeletal muscle weakness. The only cat in which the WEST did not reveal evidence of skeletal muscle weakness nor fatigability had a normal neurological examination and had been described to have already improved by the owners at the time of initial presentation.

This would appear plausible given that some CMMs, such as thymomas, are hypothesized to induce AMG as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome in humans. 2, 24 Another factor might be that the previous study 17 was not able to evaluate serum anti-AChR antibody concentration over a sufficient amount of time for immune remission to occur. In this previous study, 17 serial measurement of serum anti-AChR antibody concentration was performed in 19 cats affected by AMG without evidence of a CMM, of which 88% had a decrease in serum anti-AChR antibody concentration despite some experiencing an initial increase. 17 Because the timescale over which serum anti-AChR antibody concentration evaluation occurred is unknown in this previous study, 17 perhaps some of these concentrations might have normalized if given more time. It is worthy to note that immune remission can take up to 18 months to occur in dogs with AMG. 20 Thirdly, the lack of occurrence of immune remission among cats without evidence of a CMM in the previous study 17 might have related to failure to identify neoplastic disease at the time of presentation. Neoplasia has been identified in dogs in which immune remission was not achieved as long as 3 years after diagnosis of AMG. 20 The authors however note that AMG in cats has not been associated with neoplasia located outside the mediastinum to date.",

The brain and cervical spinal cord region were evaluated in 1 cat, whereas the thoracolumbar spinal cord region was assessed in the other cat. No abnormality was reported in either MRI study. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from the cistern of the conus medullaris in the lumbosacral region (n = 2), or from both the cistern of the conus medullaris in the lumbosacral region and the cerebellomedullary cistern (n = 2), was submitted for analysis in 4 cats. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed albuminocytological dissociation in 1 cat on both the cisternal and lumbar samples (45 mg/dL on the cisternal sample, 65 mg/dL on the lumbar sample) and did not reveal any abnormality in the remaining 3 cats. A single dose of neostigmine was administered IV to 1 cat as part of a Tensilon-like challenge test, resulting in transient complete resolution of the previously observed bilateral weakness and fatigability of the facial skeletal muscles involved in the menace response and palpebral reflex.",

Serology for Toxoplasma gondii in 4 cats demonstrated evidence of previous exposure but not of active infection in 2 cats, whereas the remaining 2 cats were naive to the protozoa. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed on CSF for Toxoplasma gondii (n = 3), coronavirus (n = 3), and FeLV (n = 1). Polymerase chains reactions were performed on blood for Toxoplasma gondii (n = 2), coronavirus (n = 2), and FIV (n = 1). All PCR results were negative. Serum anti-AChR antibody concentration was abnormal in all cats, ranging from 0.59 to 8.4 nmol/L (median value of 4.55 nmol/L). Treatment consisted of an immunosuppressive course of prednisolone at a dosage of 1 mg/kg PO Q12h for 1 month in 4 cats. This dosage of prednisolone was then slowly tapered, before being discontinued within 6 months after having been started. The remaining 4 cats did not receive any treatment. None of the cats received any supportive treatment or therapy with anticholinesterase agents. excellent in all cats as their repeated general and neurological examinations performed at least 3 weeks after any treatment had been discontinued did not reveal any abnormality, and as their owners reported complete resolution of the previously observed clinical signs. Serum anti-AChR antibody concentration measurement was repeated in all cats 6 months after diagnosis and at least 3 weeks after any treatment had been discontinued. At such time, serum anti-AChR antibody concentrations had normalized, indicating that immune remission was attained in all cats, including the 4 cats which did not receive any treatment, and whose natural course of disease therefore involved spontaneous remission. Serum anti-AChR antibody concentration was also measured 3 months after diagnosis in 1 cat undergoing treatment with prednisolone, at which point the concentration had decreased, but immune remission had not occurred yet. At the time of writing of this study, 5 cats had died or were euthanized at an old age due to unrelated disease but were not reported to have experienced any reoccurrence of the clinical signs of AMG at any point during their life, whereas the remaining 3 cats were still alive and were also not reported to have experienced any reoccurrence of the clinical signs of AMG at least 4 years after diagnosis, indicating that the long-term outcome for the disease was excellent in all cats.",
