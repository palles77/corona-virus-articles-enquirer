JHMV can remain up to 20 days in the latent state and about 14 days before the cultures lose the capacity to resume virus production upon return to 325\u00b0C. Although persistently and latently infected RN2-2 cells display resistance to superinfection by a heterologous agent VSV, these cells do not release detectable soluble mediators (e.g., interferon) of the antiviral state. Nevertheless, RN2-2 cells are competent to synthesize and release interferon when treated with the appropriate inducers. These observations suggest that interferon does not play any role or may not be the major factor in the control of latency in the Schwannoma cell. Hybridization",

Among the RNA agents the coronaviruses have sparked considerable interest in connection with demyelinating diseases of the CNS.

The epidemiological surveys which revealed that in some countries essentially 100% of the human population is seropositive (Hovi et al.. 1979; Hasony and MacNaughton, 1982; MacNaughton, 1982) attest to the ubiquity of these agents.",

The duration of latency with JHMV during which reactivation remains possible is shorter, perhaps only 14-20 days.

            "text": "The conversion of JHMV infection from the persistent into latent states upon temperature elevation to 39S\"C, and the prolonged latency which can occur in the in vitro cultures, could have direct bearing on understanding the infectious process during JHMV infection of the rat central nervous system (CNS). Since symptom-free rats. surviving an initial intracerebral infection with JHMV, can be caused, following treatment with the immunosuppressive agent. cyclophosphamide, to develop a chronic. demyelinating disease (Sorensen et al., 1982) . it is quite possible that this virus can be perpetuated in a covert form within the CNS. Consistent with this view is the finding that rats which remain asymptomatic for as long as 150 days after inoculation may harbour JHMV RNA in the CNS (Sorensen et al.. 1984 ). In the present study several approaches were taken towards an understanding of the nature of the block in virus production at the elevated temperature. As previously discussed by Lucas et al. (1978) , involvement of defective-interfering particles or development of thermosensitive virus variants was not demonstrable and, therefore, is unlikely to account for the inhibition observed. Host factors might be responsible for the observed virus suppression. One possible candidate for the host factor in question is IFN. It is' well known that during chronic in vitro infections with neurotropic agents, such as rabies virus, there is an inverse correlation between the cycling virus titre and IFN levels in the medium (Wiktor and Clark, 1972) . It may also be significant in the present context that IFN activity can be enhanced at elevated temperature (Heron and Berg, 1978) . Thus, in our system it was postulated that IFN or interferon-like substance might influence the control of the persistence at 325\u00b0C and suppression of infectious particle formation at 39.5\"C. Although in the present study the development of resistance to infection of RN2-2 cells by a heterologous virus. VSV. could be demonstrated during persistent and latent infections with JHMV and likewise with measles virus (Coulter-Mackie and Dales, unpublished observations), no evidence was obtained to demonstrate that such persistently or latently infected cells produce IFN or an IFN-like substance. These two viruses differ in that measles virus is known to be an IFN inducer (DeMaeyer and Enders, 1961: McKimm-Breschkin and Rapp, 1981) while JHMV probably does not induce IFN in cultured cells. although replication of this coronavirus is sensitive to exogenous IFN (Garlinghouse et al., 1984) . However, since these Schwannoma cells are inducible for IFN with UV-inactivated reovirus and can respond to exogenously added IFN. yet continue to produce JHMV at a normal rate after the addition of purified rat IFN to persistently infected RN2-2 cultures. it is questionable whether IFN exercises any control in this system or that involving rat neural cells in general. Therefore, the interference with VSV replication during latency or persistence remains unexplained.",

The situation regarding the other major JHMV structural polypeptides E, and E, remains unresolved. While these glycoproteins were expressed normally at the permissive temperature, we were unable to detect their presence during latency, despite the presence of mRNA species corresponding to E, and E, during the initial 2-3 days of latency. These data suggest that infection at the elevated temperature may lead to either a differential inhibition of the synthesis of envelope polypeptides, or their rapid turnover, or both. The Western blot analysis also revealed a processing step connected with the nucleocapsid protein, which is blocked during latency. The nucleocapsid is initially produced as the 56K form and integrated into the virus. Soon after infection, however, the nucleocapsid material of the inoculum exists as a 50K molecular weight polypeptide (Figs. 4 and 5) . This precursor-product relationship has been documented by Cheley and Anderson (1981a) . Both sizes of this antigen were found to be phosphorylated (our data, not shown, and Siddel et al., 1983) . The 50K proteins found in infected RN2-2 cells incubated at 32.5\"C are likely. therefore, to represent the product of processing which may occur during cell-to-cell spread of progeny virus. Upon incubation of RN2-2 cells at 395\u00b0C assembly and/or spread of the virus progeny are probably inhibited. This is consistent with our preliminary observations (Adler et al., unpublished) , which reveal that compounds interfering with JHMV entry into L-2 cells also affect processing of 56K nucleocapsid of inoculum virions.From the above it is clearly evident that in latently infected RN2-2 cells the viral genomes are not dormant and merely segregated to daughter cells but are instead, active in transcription and translation. It remains to be shown, first of all, whether genome duplication is reduced or stopped. secondly, whether the expression of some functions is specifically reduced during latency and thirdly, why the production of infectious progeny ceases. 45. 2055213.
