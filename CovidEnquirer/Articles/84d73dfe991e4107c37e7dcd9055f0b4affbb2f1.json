This self-healing process can occur autonomously or can be triggered by an external stimulus (eg, heat, radiation). Various concepts have been developed over the past decade and are still being fine-tuned. A lot of emphasis is put on the use of self-healing concrete, composites and coatings for corrosion prevention. The use of self-healing coatings on textiles has been less investigated to date.",

The coating has an enhanced flow (mostly at elevated temperatures) which enables a refill of the scratch. The restored scratch gains strength because of restored bonds (chemically/physically) (Garc\u00eda et al., 2011; Ghosh, 2009 This technology is already in use in the aerospace and automotive industry. Self-repairing car paints have been developed in which heat triggers the repair action. Several companies have developed self-healing systems which possibly could be implemented on textiles.

These organisms affect the textile's lifetime by destroying the fibres and discolouring the fabric and they may spread unpleasant odours (Boryo, 2013; Burgess, 1954) . The latter has been an important incentive to develop antimicrobial textile treatments for garments, bedding and sportswear. In addition, textiles may act as vectors for infectious diseases or spread nosocomial bacteria throughout hospital facilities (Leung and Chan, 2006; Treakle et al., 2009; Curtis White et al., 2010) . Several methods have been devised to hamper bacterial growth (bacteriostatic) or even kill bacteria (bactericide) on textiles. The treatments include releasing toxic compounds from fabric or attack microorganisms when they approach the fibre surface. Some treatments offer broad-spectrum protection whereas others are predominantly useful against bacteria or fungi. Antimicrobial compounds include metals, organometal derivatives, phenolic compounds, nitrogen and halogen compounds and nanoparticles (Coleman, 2005; Dastjerdi and Montazer, 2010; Gouveia, 2010; Shahidi and Wiener, 2012; Varesano et al., 2011; Vaun Mcarthur et al., 2012; Lacasse and Baumann, 2004; Simoncic and Tomsic, 2010) .

Although silver is relatively more effective against bacteria compared with copper, which is more effective towards fungi, in both cases the metal ion needs to be released from the metal core to exert its activity. The metal ion will form complexes with vital compounds of the microorganism such as the cell membrane, enzymes and DNA. As a result, the microorganism's metabolism fails in several crucial areas (Lemire et al., 2013) . Therefore, resistance against these ions is unlikely to develop because the microorganism is under attack at several targets at the same time. However, as to all antimicrobial products, also for silver and copper, resistive strains have been identified but only in very specific environments such as wastewater treatment plants and mining (Silver, 2003) . The active metal ions can be released by dissolving directly from the metal, or by ion exchange. The latter is often used in silver-based products in which silver ions are bound to a ceramic matrix (Lorenz et al., 2012) . Although the mobile metal ion is the active compound, metal-based antimicrobials are often not considered to be leaching out. In contrast to toxic chemical compounds, silver and copper ions easily form metal complexes with any organic substance in the vicinity. Leaching test methods such as agar diffusion tests (EN 20645 and AATCC 147) will therefore show no or only limited leaching from silver-treated fabrics.",

These molecules have a positive charge, attracting the negatively charged cell membrane of microorganisms. Mostly, the positively charged nitrogen head is followed by a long organic chain. This combination allows the molecule to puncture the cell membrane, consequently destroying the microorganisms (Curtis White et al., 2010) . The advantage of the quats' molecules is their odour-free nature and the ability to add functional groups to the organic chain, which allows them to form a chemical bond to the textile fibres.

Clearly textiles are also prone to fouling, and this chapter will focus on biofouling or biofilm formation and how it can be tackled. Fouling is a result of the stagnating flow of fluids at the surface from which debris will deposit, attracted by van der Waals forces. This process occurs within minutes after submersion. In case of biofilm formation, the first molecules depositing on the surface are proteins and polysaccharides. On the one hand, these molecules cover up any surface functionality and provide a suitable ground for bacteria to attach and develop on this new extracellular matrix (ECM). Bacteria possess surface-bound adhesion proteins designed to bind to such ECM, thus mediating colonisation of the surface. Once the bacteria and other microorganisms have gathered, exertion of more and more proteins and polysaccharides form the so-called external polysaccharide matrix in which the microorganisms thrive and form a complex ecosystem (Bixler and Bhushan, 2012; Harder and Yee, 2009) . Some microorganisms and even macroorganisms are expert in colonising virgin surfaces by excreting specially designed attachment proteins such as adhesins (well known in various infectious bacteria) and mussel adhesion proteins (Mytilus edulis) (Klemm and Schembri, 2000; Qin and Buehler, 2014) .",

Increasing the shear at the surface and limiting surface energy can be achieved by creating very sleek omniphobic surfaces (Genzer and Efimenko, 2006) . Usually, water-and oil-repellent fluorine-based coatings are used to reduce surface free energy as much as possible. As a result, both the static layer of fluids near the surface and the van der Waals forces are reduced (Van Zoelen et al., 2014) . However, microorganisms still manage to colonise these surfaces by secreting viscous, slime-like substances that cover the entire surface and thus cover the underneath functionalities. In contrast to creating hydrophobic and oleophobic surfaces, positive results have been obtained by creating extremely hydrophilic surfaces. The reasoning behind this is that fouling (organic) molecules are partially composed of long-chain hydrocarbon segments that are strongly repelled by the superhydrophilic surface properties (Patel et al., 2010) .",

The problem of UV ageing is mostly recognised for outdoor textiles, leisurewear and car interiors but also indoor textiles close to windows such as upholstery, curtains and sun blinds. UV-protective additives in finishing, dyeing, coating and extrusion focus on blocking the highly reactive UV rays from reaching sensitive pigments, binders or fibres. Some products have a high affinity for the UV waves and are preferably attacked by UV, transforming it into harmless heat (UV absorbers). Others block the propagation of free radicals initiated by UV irradiation (radical scavengers). A third mode of action is to decompose peroxides formed by UV irradiation in combination with oxygen. These products act as antioxidants but can also improve UV durability (peroxide decomposer). A final mode of action is to quench excited states and divert the energy into lower-wavelength light (fluorescence or phosphorescence) or heat (quenchers) (Patra and Gouda, 2013; Kasza, 2013; Lacasse and Baumann, 2004) . The different modes of action of UV-stabilising additives are presented in Fig. 4 .4 whereas Table 4 .2 summarises typical light-stabilising compounds.",

Sunlight consists of visible light, accompanied by about 53% IR light. IR radiation with wavelengths in the range of 780 nm up to 1 mm ( Fig. 4.3) is responsible for heating phenomena. Thus, coated textiles exposed to sunlight will heat up when absorbing these wavelengths. It is claimed that a lower-temperature increase in the coating will result in enhanced durability because of less polymer degradation and thermal expansion Pasternack, 2013) . Only limited research has been performed on the effect of reflective pigments, the related temperature rise of the coating and the durability of the coatings (Salminen, 2014) . The reflection of this IR radiation on a coated textile can be augmented by the incorporation of IR-reflective pigments. This results in a lower absorption and transmission of IR, and therefore less heating. These coatings are denominated as low-E coatings (low emissivity).",

Moreover, a given belt will last longer if it is used in mild UV conditions (eg, indoor, sporadically) compared with severe UV conditions (eg, southern Europe, long-distance open transport). As a result, there is no general rule of thumb to assess the safety of a used belt with respect to UV ageing. To counteract this concern, a coating has been developed using a mixture of UV stabilisers to be printed on the belt. In case of UV damage, the print will discolour and indicate the level of UV damage endured by the belt so far. If the safety limit has been exceeded, a text urging the user to replace the belt becomes visible. Fig. 4 .13 exemplifies such label printed on a 35-mm flat web lashing. At UV exposures above 1000 h (EN14836, QUV accelerated ageing test), the replace text is clearly visible and indicates that the belt has endured too much UV irradiation to be used safely.",

For this application, a unique balance between antifouling properties and seaweed anchoring points is crucial.",

To date, no examples of commercially available self-healing textiles are known. Research in this area is limited but the outcome is promising. In the future, self-healing coatings based on the microcapsule technology or an intrinsic approach can be expected. The self-healing coating will be able to repair at an early stage of damage, enhancing the durability and prolonging the lifetime of the coated textile.",
