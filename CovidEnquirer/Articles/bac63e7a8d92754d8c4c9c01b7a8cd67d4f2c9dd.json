Objective: Our objective was to determine the public expectations of the hospital during disasters regarding resource provision. Methods: A survey was distributed to adult patients or family members at three emergency departments (EDs).

Additionally, respondents answered questions regarding prior disaster experience and demographics. Results: There were 961 respondents (66.9% were female, 47.5% were white, and 44.6% were black). Respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the hospital should provide the following services: event-specific vaccination (84%), medication refill/replacement (76.5%), food and water (61%), grief or stress counseling (53%), FEMA access assistance (52%), short-term shelter (51%), family reunification (50%), long-term shelter (38%), and hospital transportation (29%).

There were no differences based on frequency of ED use, sex, income, or prior disaster experience. Conclusion: There is a high public expectation that hospitals will provide significant nonmedical disaster relief.

            "text": "Recent natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and epidemics, including Hurricane Katrina, the World Trade Center attack, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, have underscored the importance of disaster preparedness for many organizations. Hospitals and other health care centers lie at the center of a community's response to an emergency and are a natural focus for efforts to develop and update emergency protocols. Regulatory agencies at the local, state, and national levels have initiated standards to ensure hospitals are capable of handling a surge in patient load in the case of an emergency. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Participation Agreement and The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations require that hospitals have comprehensive emergency management plans, including provisions to have adequate staff to handle increased patient loads during a disaster (1) . Although additional responsibilities have been assigned to hospitals, little supplemental funding has been allocated to see these requirements to completion (1, 2) . In conjunction with the decline in staff-to-patient ratios, decreased compensation, and increased costs, many hospitals do not have the staff or resources to plan an effective response to a major emergency (1, 3, 4) .",

Recent disasters have shown that the public views hospitals as not only sources of medical care, but also as centralized sources of community support and assistance (5, 6) . This perception of hospitals as rallying points during an emergency generates expectations that cannot be ignored. Research has indicated that community members are likely to gather at hospitals in search of food and water, family and friends, information regarding the emergency, shelter, or electricity (2,5\u00c07). In addition to meeting immediate medical needs of the community, hospital fulfillment of these nonmedical expectations provides reassurance to the public that one of the fundamental institutions within society is still functional.",

The potential mismatch between perceived public utilization of the hospital and actual utilization could lead to the overcrowding of hospitals and the diversion of staff members from medical care to crowd management far beyond current expectations of most hospital emergency planners. The incongruities between the public's expectations and reality need to be examined, so that hospital and community emergency management plans can be revised to address these issues. The purposes of this study are to identify the public's perceptions of hospital responsibilities to those presenting without medical injury or illness during a disaster, and delineate factors associated with higher public expectations.",

The third hospital was located in a suburban area and served all ages (annual ED census 55,000). All ED visitors/patients were approached during recruiting hours (recruiting hours/shifts consisted of day and night shift, and all days of the week). The only exclusions were age younger than 18 years, those presenting with an Emergency Severity Index of 1 (i.e., those with very high medical acuity), and those who were incapable of reading or speaking English. Only one person per group (patient and his/her accompanying family or friend(s)) could take the survey. Completed paper surveys were collected anonymously.",

Lastly, demographic questions assessed participants' age, race, sex, relationship to the patient, utilization of the ED, visits to a primary care provider, and number of hospitalizations. A group of 10 U.S. disaster preparedness researchers provided feedback on content validity. The content validity index (CVI) was computed for each item (8) . No items had a CVI <0.80, so none were deleted. Items were revised based on feedback from the CVI panel. The final survey contained 15 questions plus demographic items. The questionnaire was then pilot tested using a 10-person panel of representative subjects. The final survey was considered exempt by the Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board.",

Data from the paper surveys were entered into the database. Five percent of surveys were secondarily checked for data entry accuracy by the first author. Surveys with extensive incomplete data ($70%) were excluded from analyses. An overall expectations score was calculated by assigning 1 point for each resource/service that individuals expected the hospital to provide during a disaster (i.e., if they marked that they strongly agreed or agreed somewhat that an item/service should be provided by the hospital). The highest possible expectation score was 9 (i.e., 1 point for each of the 9 items). Descriptive statistics were computed for each question and used to describe individuals' expectations of hospital responsibility during a disaster to those coming to the hospital without a medical problem or to those accompanying someone with a medical issue. Linear regression was used to describe factors associated with higher expectation scores. Nonsignificant variables, such as income, hospital location, and sex, were not included in the final model; only the final model is reported. c 2 tests were used to compare perceived expectation agreement rates (agree vs. not agree) when comparing response by race (white vs. non-white).",

            "text": "This study had two key findings. First, that there are high expectations from the public for nonmedical resources from hospitals during disasters. Secondly, that few identifiable variables alter those expectations. These findings indicate that all hospitals must expect an influx of non-ill or injured patients expecting services during disasters for which hospital emergency planners may not have accounted. One caveat to this is that this study did not measure individuals' expected utility of these resources, only what individuals expect that hospitals should provide to community members. It is possible that individuals expect more than they might anticipate they would personally need. The relationship between individuals' expectations of hospitals vs. their anticipated needs during an event requires better delineation that should be the focus of future studies. Findings from this study indicate that the general public expects hospitals to provide a variety of nonmedical resources and services during disasters, something that is likely not currently addressed in current hospital emergency management plans. This points to the need for hospitals to work with community disaster planners to redirect the public toward more appropriate locations to receive nonmedical resources during disasters. Prior research describes the importance of pre-existing networks and community relationships to rapidly mobilize and distribute resources during disasters (9) . Appropriate communication regarding access to resource and services is imperative if the community is to remain resilient during disasters (10) .",

Hospitals cannot be expected to provide food, water, medication refills, or short or long-term shelter for those without medical problems during disasters when eventrelated medical surge will already be pushing health care facilities beyond their usual limits. Indeed many, if not all, of the nonmedical resources that individuals in this study reported to expect hospitals to provide during a disaster would best be sourced elsewhere in the community. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends that event-specific vaccinations and medications be distributed using points of distribution rather than hospitals (11) . Community-based shelter is generally planned by the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, and other community-based planning agencies. Lack of functional reunification plans is a recognized gap in community disaster planning (12) . In the United States, the American Red Cross has traditionally performed family reunification during disasters. It is possible that hospitals may be able to assist with reunification, but the American Red Cross and community-based organizations, such as local worship centers, may also be used.",

Regardless of which community agency or organization will be responsible for distributing resources during a disaster, it is vital that communities educate the general public about accessing resources during an event. Identifying and communicating these plans in advance will maximize community response to a disaster. It will also help to divert healthy members of the community away from overwhelmed hospitals, allowing the medical community to focus on providing care to the ill and injured. Development of pre-event messages are recommended for shortening response time and decreasing the public's confusion about where to obtain resources during a disaster (13) .",

It is also not surprising that those with family members dependent on electricity would have an increased expectation for the hospital to provide resources during disasters, as they have an intrinsic tie to the hospital and increased medical vulnerability.
