Monitoring and testing for pathogens associated with BRD may facilitate the development of appropriate, targeted vaccination programs.

However, each of these methods has limitations. Although the TTW allows collection of a sample from the lower airways while bypassing the normal flora of the nasopharynx, the procedure is invasive and timeconsuming. In contrast, nasal swabs are simple to collect. However, the results of bacterial culture of nasal swabs may be difficult to interpret because of the potential for contamination by commensal organisms. The guarded NPS has been proposed to provide a more reliable sample of bacteria causing pneumonia, 6 but these samples can be unwieldy to collect, because the available guarded swabs are designed for mare uterine culture, making them longer than necessary for nasopharyngeal sampling; they also are relatively expensive. To our knowledge, no published study has compared the results of NS to guarded NPS in cattle with clinical BRD. Thus, it is not clear that NPS is sufficiently superior to NS to warrant the additional effort and expense they require. Furthermore, neither NS nor NPS provides a sample of the lower airways. The BAL has been proposed to provide a representative sample of the lower respiratory tract, 7 but the method of collection provides the possibility of upper airway commensal contamination of the sample. Moreover, because BAL samples only the bronchoalveolar unit distal to the wedged tube, it is possible to miss pathogens not evenly distributed throughout the lung.",

We are not aware of published reports comparing these 4 diagnostic tests for identification of pathogens associated with BRD in dairy calves. Therefore, the objective of our study was to evaluate the agreement among results obtained by TTW to those obtained by NS, guarded NPS, or BAL in calves clinically affected by BRD, by comparing pathogens isolated by each sampling method in the same calf.

For collection of NS, the calf's nares were wiped clean with a single-use paper towel. A 13-cm polyester nasal swab c then was inserted into the nostril to the full length of the swab, rubbed on the mucosa, and withdrawn. Next, the NPS sample was collected. The calf's nares again were wiped clean with a single-use paper towel, and a 59-cm guarded polyester swab d was advanced to a depth approximately 2 cm rostral to the medial canthus of the eye. The swab was advanced approximately 4 cm farther, rotated, and withdrawn into the sheath before removal. One NS and 1 NPS were collected from each nostril. The samples collected from the left nostril were submitted for viral multiplex RT-PCR, and the samples from the right nostril were submitted for bacterial culture. The swabs for viral RT-PCR were placed in viral transport media (Eagle's minimal essential media with HEPES and sodium bicarbonate; gentamicin was added at 50 mg/mL and amphotericin B was added at 250 mg/mL and pH was adjusted to 7.0-7.3), and the swabs for bacterial culture were stored in Brucella broth with 10% glycerol; media were obtained from the Biological Media Services at the University of California, Davis. After the NS and NPS were collected and a TTW was obtained, a 6 9 6 cm area over the ventral trachea was clipped, subjected to sterile preparation of alternating scrubs with chlorhexidine scrub followed by 70% isopropanol, repeated 3 times, and locally blocked with 2 mL of 2% lidocaine. A commercially available TTW kit with a 15-gauge cannula and a 48-cm catheter e was used for sample collection. After placement of the needle and catheter, 30 mL of sterile isotonic saline was instilled and withdrawn. A drop of the sample was removed from the retrieved volume of fluid with a plastic disposable serologic pipette for cytologic evaluation (cytology results to be reported elsewhere), and the remainder then was divided into equal aliquots for bacterial culture and viral RT-PCR. After collection of the TTW, the BAL was obtained. The calf's nares again were wiped clean with a single-use paper towel. A BAL tube f was advanced through the nose until it wedged in a bronchus, and 100 mL of sterile isotonic saline was instilled and withdrawn. Retrieved fluid aliquots were pooled, and a drop of the sample was removed for cytologic evaluation (results to be reported elsewhere), and the remainder was divided into equal aliquots for bacterial culture and viral RT-PCR. One aliquot was subjected to aerobic bacterial culture for identification of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and also Mycoplasma culture. Colonies identified as M. haemolytica were tested to confirm they were not Bibersteinia trehalosi or indole-positive Mannheimia spp., which can appear to be similar to Mannheimia haemolytica. Any isolate with morphology consistent with Mycoplasma spp. was subjected to digitonin testing to differentiate Mycoplasma spp. from Acholeplasma spp. 11 The second aliquot was subjected to viral multiplex real-time RT-PCR to identify the following viruses, with published primers and probes: BHV-1, 12 bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 (BVDV1 and BVDV2), g BRSV, 13 and bovine coronavirus (BCV). 14 Speciation of Mycoplasma isolates to identify Mycoplasma bovis was completed by PCR as previously described. 15 Briefly, DNA was extracted from Mycoplasma isolates with a commercially available kit h according to the manufacturer's directions. The PCRs were prepared in 25 lL volumes with M. bovis-specific primers described. 15 The PCR assays were performed with an initial cycle at 94\u00b0C for 5 minute; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 20 second, annealing at 52\u00b0C for 1 minute, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute; and extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minute. Samples that did not contain M. bovis DNA were included for quality control purposes to monitor for DNA contamination during the processing of the PCR assay reactions. The specificity of the amplified band was confirmed on the basis of detection of a single band representing a 319-bp product.",

The TTW was established as the reference standard for test comparison. Therefore, the pathogens detected by TTW for each calf were evaluated for agreement with the corresponding pathogen results for each of the other tests from the same calf: NS, NPS, and BAL. McNemar's exact test was used to compare the methods with respect to their marginal proportions of positive results, with significance set at P < .05. A sample size of 100 calves was used based on the availability of funding and a consideration of the power to detect a significant difference among methods with respect to the paired proportions of positive test results. It was determined that a sample size of 72 calves with a particular pathogen would provide a power of 80% to detect a difference of 15 percentage points in the proportions of positive test results, assuming a 5% type I error probability and discordant test results in 20% of the calves. Based on previous research by Lehenbauer et al. (personal communication), it was assumed that approximately 70% of the calves might be expected to have the most common pathogen; thus, a minimum enrollment of 100 calves was desired. The agreement among diagnostic tests then was evaluated by calculation of the kappa statistic and the percent positive agreement. Kappa values were interpreted to indicate strength of agreement as defined by Altman 16 : <0.20 = poor; 0.21-0.40 = fair; 0.41-0.6 = moderate; 0.61-0.80 = good, and 0.81-1.00 = very good. The percent positive agreement between 2 methods was calculated as 100 times the number of calves that were positive by both methods divided by the average number of calves that were positive by either method. 17 Analyses were performed by commercially available statistical software. i",

To our knowledge, no previously published studies have compared the results of all 4 of these methods, although previous studies have compared NS or NPS to lower airway sampling. 6, 8, 9 The results of our study suggest that NS, NPS, or BAL are all similar in their ability to determine when M. haemolytica, P. multocida, or M. bovis are present in the lower airways of dairy calves with acute BRD, as identified by TTW. In contrast, for the viral agents identified in this study, agreement (as measured by percent positive agreement and also by the kappa statistic) was stronger for BAL and TTW than for NS or NPS and TTW. Moreover, for BCV, the significant McNemar's test indicated that the positive test For some agents, the total number of samples is less than 100 because samples were not included if the laboratory reported them as contaminated or indeterminate.

One study compared the bacteria isolated from guarded NPS to those isolated from postmortem lung lavage in 4-to 6month-old beef calves with naturally occurring acute BRD. 6 With samples from 20 animals, these investigators found that identification of these pathogens by NPS was a reliable way to predict that they also would be present in lung lavage. Another study compared results of bacterial culture to identify M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and H. somni from guarded NPS to results of culture of samples collected by \"guarded transtracheal swab.\" 9 These investigators found that when both samples were positive on bacterial culture, the same organism was present 96% of the time. Similar to previous findings, 6 when the 2 samples were not in agreement, it was more common for the NPS to be negative when the lower airway sample was positive than vice versa. Another study evaluated the bacterial pathogens isolated from guarded NPS and BAL by endoscopy in 59 feedlot cattle with signs of acute BRD and 60 matched control cattle. 8 Using data from both cases and controls, these investigators found that kappa ranged from 0.47-0.61 for M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and M. bovis. They concluded that NPS accurately represented the results of lower airway culture at the group level but not at the level of the individual animal. In our study, the proportion of samples found to be positive for M. haemolytica, P. multocida, Mycoplasma sp., or Mycoplasma bovis by NPS was not significantly different from the proportion found to be positive for these bacterial pathogens by TTW.",

However, given that approximately half as many nasal swabs were positive for BRSV as compared to TTW, if a larger number calves positive for BRSV had been identified, the difference between NS and TTW might have reached statistical significance. In contrast, for BCV, the NS and NPS both yielded significantly higher proportions of positive results compared with TTW.
