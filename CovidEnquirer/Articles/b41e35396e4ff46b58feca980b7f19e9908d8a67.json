A training set of spectra was used to generate diagnostic models, and a blind testing set was used to determine the accuracy of the models. Candidate peptides were identified using nano-liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the training set results, 3 diagnostic models recognized LTBI subjects with good cross-validation accuracy. In the blind testing set, LTBI subjects could be identified with sensitivities and specificities of 85.20% to 88.90% and 85.7% to 100%, respectively. Additionally, 14 potential LTBI biomarkers were identified, and all proteins were identified for the first time through proteomics in the plasma of healthy, latently infected individuals. In all, proteomic pattern analyses can increase the accuracy of LTBI diagnosis, and the data presented here provide novel insights into potential mechanisms involved in LTBI.",

Most people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) retain the initial infection and develop latent TB. This state is characterized by evidence of an immune response against the bacterium but no signs of active infection. Latent TB can be maintained for the lifetime of the infected person. However, the MTB bacilli that persist in symptom-free individuals can reactivate and cause active disease in approximately 10% of those infected over a lifetime (Jasmer et al., 2002; Pai et al., 2004; Tufariello et al., 2003 ). An estimated one-third of the world's population is infected with MTB (Dye et al., 1999) . This large reservoir of individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) poses a hurdle for TB elimination (CDC, 2000; Sterling et al., 2006 Sterling et al., , 2011 .",

            "text": "For nearly a century, the tuberculin skin test (TST) was the only available test for the detection of LTBI. However, the TST has its limitations, including low sensitivity in immunocompromised patients, cross-reactivity with the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine and environmental mycobacteria, and the need for a second visit, which often results in missed follow-ups (Menzies, 2000) . A decade ago, interferon-\u03b3 release assays (IGRAs) were developed, in which interferon-\u03b3 titres are measured after the in-vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with antigens such as early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10). IGRAs have now become the gold standard for identifying individuals whose immune systems have previously encountered MTB (Lawn and Zumla, 2011) . However, the sensitivity of these assays remains limited (70-85%) (Sester et al., 2011) , and the higher material costs of IGRAs and their need for laboratory infrastructure, trained personnel, and venipuncture under field conditions pose serious practical limitations, particularly for high-burden, resource-limited countries. To date, no community-based surveys have been performed using IGRAs. In addition, the mechanisms involved in maintaining a latent infection are complex, and many fundamental questions regarding these mechanisms remain unanswered. Consequently, there is a need for better biomarkers for diagnosing LTBI and a greater understanding of the LTBI pathogenesis.",

Particularly, magnetic beads combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) are a promising high-throughput approach to identify new potential biomarkers in various body fluids. Magnetic beads have large surface area and can capture more lowabundance peptides and proteins. The combination of magnetic beads and MALDI-TOF MS can leverage the advantages of both methods and, therefore, reduce the complexity and enrich low-abundance proteins (Huang et al., 2009) . The technical performance of affinity bead purification is similar to that of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and it can be used to process many samples in parallel (Cheng et al., 2005) . Many protein biomarkers of diseases have been identified using Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease 79 (2014) 432-437 this technique (Dekker et al., 2010; Fiedler et al., 2009; Komori et al., 2012; Schwamborn et al., 2009) . Previously, 1 study demonstrated that proteomic patterns based on such profiles can distinguish active TB from non-TB individuals (Deng et al., 2011) . However, there remains a lack of published data using this method as a tool for biomarker discovery in LTBI.",

ClinProt is a well-established system that enables proteomic profiling using the bioinformatics software ClinProTools, which provides algorithms for multivariate statistical analyses and improves the detection of candidate peaks (Ishigami et al., 2012) . In 2012, Sandhu et al. (2012) published a report demonstrating that active TB can be accurately distinguished from LTBI in symptomatic patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS). Unfortunately, this research did not identify the distinguishing proteins because the major drawback of the SELDI-TOF-MS approach is that the retained proteins cannot be directly recovered from the ProteinChip arrays. Moreover, chip-to-chip variation is another obstacle for the SELDI analysis. To overcome these problems, a magnetic bead-based plasma profiling method was developed in this study. This method leaves sufficient materials for subsequent protein identification experiments and can reduce assay-to-assay and researcherto-researcher variations using functionalized magnetic beads and automated machines (Wong et al., 2010) .",

These proteins may take part in inflammation control, which implicates active innate immune responses in an infection with MTB and suggests that the inflammatory response may play an important role during an LTBI. Among the APPs found in LTBI, fibrinogen is a necessary cofactor for toxic and proinflammatory activities. Fibrinogen includes fragments of the fibrinogen \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 chains, but in this study, we demonstrate that the fibrinogen \u03b1 chain precursor is the best discriminator and GA, SNN, and QC these 3 models all selected this protein. It is possible that fibrinogen \u03b1 chain is more associated with an inflammatory response to MTB than \u03b2 and \u03b3 chains of fibrinogen. Liu et al. (2008) found that fibrinogen was up-regulated in the proteomic profiling of TB pericardial effusions and proposed that fibrinogen may be significantly involved in the etiology of the tuberculous pericardial effusion. A study of an in vivo mice model of mycobacterial granuloma formation observed that fibrinogen promoted granulation tissue formation and suppressed leukocyte necrosis (Sakamoto et al., 2010) . In the present study, we found that the fibrinogen \u03b1 chain precursor was significantly increased in the plasma of LTBI individuals. Our results and those of other investigators indicate that fibrinogen and/or its fragments may be involved in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of TB or LTBI and may serve as useful markers.",

HLA-F adjacent transcript 10 expression is induced by interferon-\u03b3 and tissue necrosis factor \u03b1, which are crucial for protective immunity against mycobacteria (Tufariello et al., 2003) . Another up-regulated enzyme, leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase (LTB4DH), is a member of the zinc-independent medium chain dehydrogenase reductase family.

We observed up-regulated expression of TKT, implying its important role as an antioxidant. Prx-I belongs to a ubiquitous peroxiredoxin family, which has been shown to have multiple functions, such as enhancing natural killer cell activity, increasing cell resistance to oxidative stress, regulating transcription activator protein, and protecting erythrocytes against oxidative stress (Chen et al., 2004) . Our current data showed that the Prx-I level in LTBI individuals was lower than in healthy controls, suggesting that the capacity of self protection is impaired in LTBI individuals in response to oxidative stress.

Additionally, 14 potential LTBI biomarkers were identified. Some of the identified proteins might participate in the regulation of inflammatory, antioxidative and host immune responses against MTB. It should be noted that measuring plasma protein levels is technically much easier than other approaches, such as IGRA, and offers an economical and effective initial detection tool in a clinical setting. It is our hope that further validation of these plasmatic profiles in LTBI will provide information on LTBI-associated targets and the process of pathogenesis.",
