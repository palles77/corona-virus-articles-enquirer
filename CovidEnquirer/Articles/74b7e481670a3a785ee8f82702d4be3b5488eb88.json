The demand for health functional foods is steadily increasing, and red ginseng is the most demanded food among women in the 50s, followed by multivitamin, omega-3, glucosamine and aloe. To date, there is insufficient evidence on the effect of red ginseng on exercise capacity, somatic symptom and cognitive performance in healthy individuals. Moreover, evidence is insufficient that a nutritional dose of vitamin or mineral reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer, or mortality rate. A steady intake of oily fish is recommended to prevent the incidence of cardiovascular disease for postmenopausal women. Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids is expected to prevent cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with almost no intake of oily fish and those not taking statins. It still remains controversial whether glucosamine is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Hence, physicians should fully inform patients with all controversial information about the effectiveness of glucosamine when prescribing glucosamine for patients with osteoarthritis.

About 25 different supplements including chitosan, squalene and others are approved as supplementary health foods, and they have been sold as medicine or food. The term \"health food supplements\" used until 2002 is now currently converted to \"health functional foods.\" This term is used interchangeably as dietary supplements in the United States, food for specific health use in Japan, and food supplements in Europe. 1 Even though accurate statistics have not been available in Korea, the scale of Korea' s health functional food market was estimated to be worth 3.9 trillion won in 2011. Some reports have suggested that sharp rise in demand for health functional foods has been observed as external environmental factors such as avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have increasingly drawn much attention since 2008. Red ginseng is one of the most widely consumed health functional foods, in addition to multivitamin, omega-3, glucosamine and others. The most commonly consumed food is red ginseng, followed by multivitamin, omega-3, glucosamine and aloe in women in the 50' s. 2 ",

While ginseng is usually grown for 4 to 6 years, peeled and then dried to reduce the water content to 12% or less. White ginseng may contain less of the therapeutic constituents. Red ginseng is made from 6-year-old fresh ginseng that is steamed at 100 o C and then sun-dried. Through this process, ginseng starch begins to gelatinize, increasing the amount of saponin content. Therefore, red ginseng is more widely used as herbal medicine compared to white ginseng. The pharmacological action of red ginseng is mostly generated by ginsenosides, known as ginseng saponins, and polysaccharides. In addition, polyacethylenes, sesquiterpenes and peptidoglycans are identified to have pharmacological effect. 4 In traditional medicine, red ginseng is known as an adaptogen that restores and enhances normal well-being.",

In a study of Hwang et al. 5 1 g/kg of red ginseng was given to mice orally daily during two weeks of exercise. Consequently, fat oxidation during the initial exercise period significantly increased in the red ginseng group compared to the nonred ginseng group. Furthermore, the liver glycogen stores significantly decreased immediately after the one-hour exercise but compared to at rest in the red ginseng group, but did not differ between immediately after the one-hour exercise and at rest in the red ginseng group. These findings suggest that the administration of mice with red ginseng during two weeks of exercise boosts fat oxidation and has glycogen-sparing effect, and red ginseng is involved in delaying peripheral fatigue during exercise. 5 Lee et al. 6 Some reports have proposed that red ginseng can improve erectile dysfunction in men. 9, 10 With respect to the effect of red ginseng on sexual dysfunction, animal tests have shown that red ginseng has a relaxing effect on rabbit vaginal smooth muscles through NO pathway and hyperpolarization via Ca 2+ activated K + channels. 11 Moreover, red ginseng has found to improve sexual arousal in postmenopausal women. 12 According to Choi et al. 4 there is insufficient evidence on the effect of red ginseng on exercise capacity, somatic symptom and cognitive performance in healthy individuals.",

This study was performed to examine whether esophageal and gastric cardia cancers were reduced in patients with esophageal dysplasia that appeared to be a precancerous lesion. According to the results, although multivitamin supplementation did not decrease the incidence of esophageal, gastric and other cancers and cerebrovascular disease and mortality rate in overall, mortality rate was reduced in the group administered with selenium, vitamin E and beta carotene in combination compared with other groups administered with other components. 13 During the 10-year follow-up after stopping multivitamin and mineral supplementation, the effect of combined administration of selenium, vitamin E and beta-carotene persisted in reducing mortality rate, but this effect lasted only in subjects aged below 55 years. 14 In contrast, the intake of antioxidant vitamins and minerals did not lower the incidence of cancer or ischemic heart disease in healthy individuals according to the SU.VI.",

For these reasons, antioxidants supplements need to be considered as medicinal products rather than supplements. Thus, sufficient evaluation is necessary before marketing. 21 Since the conversion of ALA contained in vegetable oil to DHA or EPA is very inefficient, there is weaker evidence that ALA intake decreases cardiovascular events compared with DHA or EPA. Thus, it is almost impossible that taking flaxseed oil may influence cardiovascular disease progression. 22 The mechanisms by which omega-3 fatty acids may reduce risk for cardiovascular disease are thought to be attributable to lowered serum triglyceride levels and antithrombotic, antiinflammatory and antihypertensive activities. 24 Several clinical studies identified that intake of fish oil reduces serum triglyceride level and blood pressure in both normal individuals and patients with hypertriglyceridemia, and lowers the frequency of arrythmia and the progression of atherosclerosis. Thus, we have arrived at a conclusion that daily intake of 0.5 to 1.8 g of EPA/DHA decreases mortality rate caused by cardiovascular disease, and the sufficient amount of omega-3 fatty acids can be achieved by eating fatty fish at least twice a week. 25 The American Heart Association recommends that adults http://dx.doi.org/10.6118/jmm.2015.21.1.12 eat fish (particularly fatty fish) at least twice a week, and foods rich in ALA such as tofu, soybeans, walnuts, flaxseeds and their oil, and canola oil. Moreover, 1 g of EPA and DHA daily is recommended when coronary artery disease is already present, and 2 to 4 g of EPA and DHA daily is suggested to decrease triglyceride levels by 20% to 40%. 26 In the analysis results of the Nurses' Health Study on postmenopausal women, the incidence rate of coronary artery disease was significantly reduced with an increasing intake frequency of fish at once a month, 1 to 3 times a month, once a week, 2 to 4 times a week, and more than 5 times a week.",

In the study, more than 18,000 Japanese patients with hypercholesterolaemia were recruited., The incidence rate of cardiovascular disease was reduced by 19% in the group consumed 1.8 g of EPA with statins daily for 5 years compared to that of the group with statins alone. 29 According to a recent meta-analysis of 20 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) performed on about 68,000 subjects, omega-3 supplements did not reduce overall mortality rate, and mortality rate caused by cardiovascular disease, and the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. 30 However, several limitations have been pointed out in the results of those studies. 31 Therefore, consistent consumption of fatty fish is recommended to prevent the risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Taking omega-3 supplement is expected to prevent cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women almost not eating oily fish and not taking statins. 32 The results from literature reviews provide that omega-3 intake, beside cardiovascular disease, has preventive effect on osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction, cancer and inflammation. 33 Glucosamine Glucosamine is an endogenous aminomonosaccharide synthesized from glucose, and is a precursor for the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins.",

Nevertheless, patients with DM should monitor their blood glucose level more frequently when taking glucosamine supplements. Moreover, glucosamine made from crustacean shells is strictly forbidden in people with shellfish allergy or asthma. Physicians should fully inform patients with osteoarthritis about the effects and controversies of glucosamine when prescribing glucosamine supplements. Glucosamine with potential benefits can be taken into consideration especially when other drugs are not usable. Since most positive results are noticed 30 to 90 days after taking glucosamine sulfate, patients will decide whether they should continue treatment after trying glucosamine sulfate for 60 days. 34 In conclusion, although some study results suggest that red ginseng can boost immunity against influenza infection and improve erectile dysfunction, but its beneficial effects are unclear in healthy persons. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence that multivitamin intake prevents the risk of chronic disease or cancer and reduces mortality rate in healthy adults on a balanced diet. Eating fishy oil more than twice a week or taking omega-3 on a regular basis lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease. It still remains controversial glucosamine is effective in osteoarthritis, so it can be taken into account in patients who are unable to take other osteoarthritis medicines after detailed consultation.",

When they observed human alveolar epithelial cells infected with H1N1, RGE did not increase the viability of cells prior to infection, but reduced the cytopathogenic effect of H1N1 infection with RGE level and cell death caused by influenza virus infection. Yin et al. 7 administered mice with saponin, polysaccharide, total RGE and antiviral medication orally to identify which components of red ginseng have anti influenza effect, and observed survival after injecting the lethal dose of influenza A virus. As a result, they verified that polysaccharides are main components for antiviral effect. Oh et al. 8 demonstrated that red ginseng supplements has the potential to improve postprandial plasma glucose level and they suggested that red ginseng supplementation may be beneficial for individual with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 DM.",

Major types of omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Omega-6 fatty acids include linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA). Mammals require the two essential fatty acid, ALA and LA to yield more bioactive derivatives through elongation and desaturation, and longer chain derivatives, EPA and DHA as well as AA can be obtained through oral intake of diet. 23 LA is elongated and desaturated to form AA which encourages the production of proinflammatory cytokines, setting the stage for inflammation. ALA is elongated to EPA and DHA which are major components of the phospholipid membranes of the brain and retina and have anti-inflammatory effect. 24 Omega-3 rich foods are salmon, herring, anchovi, sablefish, whitefish, tuna and others. Common vegetable oils have a higher content of omega-6 than omega-3. Although flaxseed, canola, mustard, walnut, soybean and other vegetable oils are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vegetable oils abundantly contain ALA and have low levels of EPA or DHA.",
