Here we report that self-administered intranasal interferon can be effective, and show how prophylaxis against rhinovirus infection is affected by both the quantity of interferon, and the interval between a dose and virus challenge. Finally, the medication regimen suggested for use in field trials (3.85 MU 3 times/day) was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in volunteers. Although virus challenge was at a time when those being treated with interferon would be most susceptible, a substantial protective effect was still demonstrated.",

Healthy volunteers of both sexes, aged 18 to 50 yr were recruited, screened for suitability, and housed in isolation in groups of 2 to 3 at the Common Cold Unit according to our usual procedure [2] . Initial blood samples were taken for haematological and biochemical tests, including estimation of electrolytes, and to provide serum for the determination of neutralising antibody to human rhinovirus types 9 (HRV9) and 14 (HRV14). Volunteer accomodation units (flats) were divided into 2 groups so that the occupants were matched for age and sex. One group was allocated to interferon treatment, and the other to placebo administration. This procedure reduced the risk of treatment error by ensuring that only one treatment schedule was represented in each flat. On every trial, the occupants of 1 or 2 flats in each group were challenged with saline; the remaining volunteers were given nasal drops containing HRV9, followed 1 h later by HRV14 (geometric mean doses calculated from back titration were 50 TCIDs0 and 190 TCIDs0, respectively).",

Volunteers were familiarised with the sprays (containing PBS) on the day before medication began.

However there were large and significant reductions in clinical score and nasal secretion, which were accompanied by a significant reduction in the proportion of volunteers excreting virus on day 2 after challenge ( Fig. 2) . That prophylaxis was successful in this trial, in spite of the reduced dose of interferon may have been because virus challenge closely followed the second dose. To investigate this possibility, we repeated the study with an interval of 13 to 14 h between the second interferon dose and the virus challenge. There was a similar response to challenge with HRV9 and HRVI4 in both the interferon and placebo-treated groups ( Table 3) . Although there were fewer colds and antibody rises in the interferon-treated group, these reductions were not significant. There was no significant difference between the two groups in either clinical score, nasal secretion or virus excretion, nor was there a consistent trend in any variable to suggest a prophylactic effect of interferon (Fig. 3) .

In these experiments, mild, moderate or severe colds were considered significant, as they were invariably accompanied by laboratory evidence of infection, either virus was isolated, an antibody rise demonstrated, or both; also they did not occur in saline-challenged volunteers. No significant colds were produced by virus challenge in any of the interferon-treated volunteers, and interferon protected against challenge with both HRV9 and HRV 14 (data not shown). However, in further experiments the surprising degree of protection produced by a single daily dose decayed to undetectable levels within 13 to 14 h. In experiments in which the dose of interferon was varied, 2.37 MU twice a day had a significantly greater protective effect than 0.0218 MU or 0.223 MU. However 3 out of 25 volunteers treated with 2.37 MU, and challenged with virus 6 h or more after the third dose developed colds. There was a consistent (but not statistically significant) trend toward protection in the 2.37 MU treatment group when the interval between the third dose of interferon and virus challenge was 6 and 7 rather than 10 and 11 h. This suggests that HuIFN-a2 given 6 h before virus challenge had a greater protective effect than when given only 1 to 2 h afterwards (this being the interval after which the fourth dose of interferon followed virus challenge in the 10 and 11 h challenge group).",

Experiments which measure a clinical response to rhinovirus challenge may be insufficiently sensitive to detect all but large effects on virus replication. We found that protection against clinical symptoms decayed rapidly, and that relatively large amounts of intranasally administered HuIFN-ct2 were necessary in order to prevent a cold. As protein solutions are rapidly cleared from the nose with a half-lifetime of approximately 20 rain [ 1] , high concentrations of interferon may be maintained with a smaller daily dose if the frequency of dosing, rather than the quantity in a dose is increased.

A suitable formulation and presentation of HulFN-ct2 was tested in a placebo-controlled trial in volunteers in which we sought to demonstrate the minimum protective effect of such a regimen. Although volunteers were challenged with rhinovirus at a time when those receiving interferon might be expected to be most susceptible to infection (4 and 5 h after the fourth dose) a substantial protective effect was still demonstrated. Interferon treatment produced significant reductions in both clinical and laboratory evidence of infection, although protection was not complete as there were 2 significant colds amongst 17 treated volunteers.",

However, the beneficial effects of a drug may be less easily detected in field trials than in carefully controlled volunteer studies. By reproducing conditions in our experiments as unfavourable for prophylaxis as any which might be expected to occur in nature, we tried to ensure that the dosage regimen chosen would have a substantial protective effect against naturally acquired rhinovirus infection.
