In an attempt to define whether cellular or humoral immune responses are involved in the occurrence of the autoimmune based disease process, Lewis rats were treated with different combinations of antibodies and T cells reactive with either MV and its structural proteins or MBP and MBP-peptides. The only treatment combination after which experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-like disease and pathology developed was when non-encephalitogenic T cells reactive against residues 69-81 of MBP were adoptively transferred into MV-infected Lewis rats. The results of the study show that T cells which are non-encephalitogenic in the normal central nervous tissue are capable of inducing an allergic encephalomyelitis in animals with a viral infection involving the brain.",

            "text": "Autoimmune reactions have been observed to occur in acute and chronic RNA and DNA virus infections (Ter Meulen, 1989) . The pathogenetic significance of such autoimmunity, however, is not well understood in most circumstances. Particularly autoantibodies disappear usually when the virus has been eliminated from the body. In contrast, cell-mediated autoimmune reactions (CMAI) may persist in the absence of the causative infectious agent, for example in postinfectious encephalomyelitis or after antiviral vaccination (Johnson, 1987) . That CMAI do play a pathogenetic role has been shown by inducing clinical disease and neuropathological changes following the adoptive transfer of myelin basic protein (MBP) autoantigen-Correspondence to: Dr. U.G. Liebert, Institut fiir Virologie und Immunbiologie, Universit~it Wiirzburg, Versbacher Strasse 7, D 8700 Wiirzburg, Germany. specific CD4 \u00f7 T cells and subsequent induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats and mice (Zamvil et al., 1985; Sedgwick et al., 1987) . In order to elucidate the mechanisms of virus-induced autoimmunity, an animal model has been established in which in the course of persistent infection, measles virus (MV) induced T lymphocytes with autoreactivity for CNS antigens were detected (Liebert et al., 1988 (Liebert et al., , 1990 . Evidence for a pathogenetic role of the observed autoreactivity is based on: (1) adoptive transfer of EAE-like disease with MBP-reactive CD4 \u00f7 T ceils derived from infected rats; (2) fine specificity of encephalitogenic T cells in animals with EAE and subacute measles viral encephalitis (SAME); and (3) substitution of sequences from the encephalitogenic region of MBP by measles virus in the induction of EAE. Previously we have shown that immunization of Lewis rats with a peptide comprising residues 69-81 (GSLPQKSQRSQ) of guinea pig MBP sufficed to lead to the development of EAE in MV infected rats. The peptide 69-81 represents 11 of the 14 amino acid sequence (residues 69-84: GSLPQKSQRSQDEN) which form the major encephalitogenic region of MBP and are required to induce EAE in unprimed Lewis rats (Hashim et al., 1986) .",

Passive transfer of antibodies or immunoglobulins was done according to the schedule published by Linington and Lassmann (Lassmann et al., 1988; Linington et al., 1988) . MV antibodies were prepared by immunization of rats or rabbits with gradient purified measles virions as well as MBP, or peptides 69-81 and 69-84 respectively.

First, different MV-reactive hyperimmune sera or purified immunoglobulin from monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas were intravenously administered into rats that were immunized with MBP peptide 69-81. This treatment was ineffective as neither clinical nor histological changes were observed (Table 1) . For a second set of experiments, T cell lines were established by immunization of rats with MV (lines MV1L, MV3L, MV4L) or bacterially expressed recombinant nucleocapsid (N) protein (line MVN1L). All lines proliferate with MV antigen added to cultures. Lines MV1L, MV3L and MV4L recognized the N as well as the haemagglutinin (H) protein of MV. Additional reactivity to matrix (M) or fusion (F) protein was detected in line MV4L, and for line MV1L a minor reactivity was seen against M protein (Table 2) . Line MVN1L was induced by immunizing rats with recombinant N protein, selected in vitro from bulk cultures by addition of inactivated measles virions during the first two restimulation cycles and maintained with the alternating addition of either MV or N protein. This line was reactive only with N protein and showed no proliferation with any of the other MV structural proteins ( Table 2 ). The four cell lines did not proliferate (3HdT uptake) when MBP or MBP peptides were added to cultures. From the third restimulation cycle, the four T cell lines expressed the a//3 T cell receptor and were CD4 \u00f7 as determined by FACS analysis. Experiments where OX6 and OX18 monoclonal antibodies were added in the 219 6-8-week-old Lewis rats were subcutaneously immunized with 100 p,g MBP peptide 69-81. 10-12 days later, anti MV sera from rabbit (RaMV serum, 1 ml) or rat (raMV serum, 0.5-1 ml), mouse immunoglobulin (Ig, 500/xg) directed against the MV nucleocapsid (N) or haemagglutinin (H), protein A column-purified from hybridoma supernatant were given intraperitoneally for 5 days.

In three alternating cycles of antigen restimulation and expansion in IL-2, bulk single-cell spleen and lymph node cultures were restimulated with peptide 69-81. After the third restimulation, both cell lines reacted only with MBP peptide 69-81 but not with longer peptides or complete MBP which comprise the 69-81 sequence. Furthermore, both cell lines do not proliferate in the presence of MV or its proteins (Table 4 ). FACS analysis revealed the a/[3 TCR \u00f7 CD4 \u00f7 CD8-phenotype which characteristically is seen with the protocol used for T cell line establishment ( Table 5 ). The addition of antibodies against rat CD4 (W3/35), CD8 (OX8), as well as MHC class I (OX18) and II (OX6 and OX17) to cultures that contained antigen-presenting cells, T line cells and peptide 69-81 showed absent or reduced proliferation when antibodies OX6 or W3/25 were The distribution of the T cell receptor Vfl-genes was determined by FACScan analysis. added, while OX8 as well as OX17 and OX18 were ineffective. Hence, the results confirm the FACS results and further reveal MHC class II restriction of the cell line (Table 4 ). The use of monoclonal antibodies directed against V/3-gene products showed that both MBP peptide 69-81-reactive cell lines, similar to a MBP cell line expressed predominantly (line $67-1) or exclusively Vfl 8.2 (Table 5) . One of the two peptidereactive T cell lines (line $67-2) was used for adoptive transfer experiments. 0.5-16 x 106 T cells were intravenously injected into rats 28-42 days after intracerebral MV infection. At this time point, the blood-brain barrier is intact and measles virus can not be recovered from the CNS. In some rats, however, viral antigen is present in isolated cells of neuronal type in the cortex and basal ganglia as well as thalamus. Within 4-6 days of transfer of a minimum of 2 x 106 $67-2 T ceils, an EAE-like disease occurs. In all rats with clinical signs of encephalomyelitis and in some without clinical symptoms, the characteristic perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of lympho-mononuclear cells were seen in transverse and longitudinal sections through the spinal cord. In contrast, no lesions were detected in sections from rats that were mock-infected or infected with inactivated MV, even when cell numbers as high as 16 x 106 were transferred intravenously (Table 6 ).",

In contrast, immunization with the peptide after mock-infection or UV inactivation of the virus was ineffective (Liebert et al., 1990) . It was concluded that in MV-infected Lewis rats the immunological response to viral antigen probably complements the T cell responsiveness to a normally non-encephalitogenic MBP epitope and that additional factors may be involved in the development of virus-induced autoimmune reactions against brain tissue. It has also been reported that the immunological expression of either of two epitopes of MBP residues 75-84 and 69-81, which cover the entire, major encephalitogenic site, does not lead to the development of EAE in Lewis rats (Offner et al., 1987; Hashim and Day, 1988) . Here we show that T ceils specific for MBP peptide 69-81 acquire encephalitogenic potential when adoptively transferred into MV infected animals. Transfer of these cell lines into mock-infected rats or rats that were intracerebrally injected with inactivated MV was ineffective and lead to neither clinical nor histological signs of EAE. These results correlate well with earlier oberservations in animals immunized with the peptide 69-81 (Liebert et al., 1990) .",

            "text": "The presence of MBP-reactive CD4 + T cells to MBP is one of the requirements for the induction of EAE. Furthermore, it was shown that demyelination may occur when antibodies enter the CNS as a consequence of blood-brain barrier disturbance caused by small numbers of encephalitogenic T cells (Lassman et al., 1988) . On the basis of our complementation experiments with peptide 69-81 and MV infection, we tried to define a region on measles virus carrying the required sequences for either humoral or cellular immune responses responsible for EAE in peptide 69-81-primed rats. However, all attempts failed and we did not succeed so far to substitute the active MV infection by either humoral or cellular immune responses against MV or its proteins. A possible explanation could be that the peptide-reactive T cells in contrast to MBP-specific T cells are incapable in disturbing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. This interpretation, however, is unlikely, since we detected increased levels of both albumin and anti-MV antibodies in the cerebrospinal levels of both albumin and anti-MV antibodies (when MV antibodies were administered intravenously, data not shown). No increased immunoglobulin level was detected in the CSF of control rats which received no peptide-reactive T cells but equivalent amounts of MV antibodies. This indicates increased permeability of the barrier for immunoglobulins in recipients of peptide-specific T cells. Taken together, the inability to induce EAE with isolated immune responses, either humoral or cellular, against MV or MV proteins, and the synergistic interaction between MBP peptide-reactive T cells and MV infec-tion in the induction of EAE in Lewis rats indicate that complementation for EAE requires the active infection and replication of MV in brain cells. The mechanism of EAE induction in the measles-infected animals does apparently not involve cross-reactivity of MBP or MBP peptide-reactive T cell lines with MV components. Sequence comparison between the 69-84 sequence of MBP and MV proteins has not revealed homology or the presence of common T cell epitope motifs (Liebert et al., 1990) . A possible explanation for the synergism between MV infection and MBP peptide T cell response may be a modification of cvto-and lymphokine expression in brain cells after viral infection Moskophidis et al., 1991; Shankar et al., 1992) which ultimately may upregulate MHC class II or adhesion molecules in the CNS (D6rries et al., personal communication) . It is conceivable that these changes could facilitate the interaction between T cells and the CNS. Moreover, processing and presentation of MBP peptides may be altered in the infected CNS so that additional peptides not present in an immunological form are seen by the immune system. One such peptide could represent the 69-81 sequence of MBP. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of peptide 69-81 reactivity in all analysed MBP-specific T cell lines isolated from rats suffering from EAE and the failure to isolate peptide 69-81-reactive T cells from MBP-primed rats (Liebert et al., 1990) . Additional investigations including peptide rescue experiments from viral-infected brain cell cultures are necessary to investigate this possibility. It is tempting to speculate that autoimmune diseases may develop on the basis of similar phenomena and ultimately lead to chronic inflammatory CNS processes which perpetuate even in the absence of the triggering agent. Further investigations will hopefully elucidate mechanism(s) of virus-induced autoimmunity and provide therapeutic approaches to prevent the initiation of autoimmune disease processes.",
