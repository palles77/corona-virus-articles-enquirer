This study attempted to identify the stage-specific difficulties encountered by Taiwan's surviving frontline nurses during the anti-SARS process. A two-step within-method qualitative triangulation research design was used to obtain the in-depth and confidential thoughts of 200 participants during the precaring, tangible caring, and postcaring stages. Six major types of stage-specific difficulties with and threats to the quality of care of SARS patients were identified according to each specific stage of the caring process. Four themes were further explored; these are discussed to provide a background context in obtaining better understanding of the multifaceted needs of nurses during this crisis. Consequently, a conceptual framework was developed to depict this complex phenomenon.",

During the past 20 years, more than 30 new disease-causing organisms, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have been identified; these organisms became visible to science as a result of environmental factors, demographic factors, and a marked increase in international commerce and travel (Kumate, 1997; World Health Organization [WHO] , 2003a). Lee (2004) stated that SARS was the first disease to affect the entire world since globalization. From November 1, 2002 , to August 7, 2003 , across 32 countries/regions, the total cumulative number of cases (CNC) of SARS was 8,422 and the number of deaths (ND) was 916. The top five countries/ regions by CNC and ND (WHO, 2003a) were China (CNC = 5,327, ND = 349), the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (China; CNC = 1,755, ND = 300), Taiwan (CNC = 665, ND = 180), Canada (CNC = 251, ND = 41), and Singapore (CNC = 238, ND = 33). SARS cases erupted in major cities throughout Taiwan over a very short time. The entire national health care system, in the metropolitan Taipei area in particular, approached collapse, and the first level of the health care warning system was triggered. In Taiwan, 18.2% (n = 121) of the probable SARS cases were health care workers, including nurses (9.5%, n = 63), physicians (2.6%, n = 17), and allied personnel (6.2%, n = 41). The fatality rate in Taiwan reached 27% (n = 180), and 17 (2.6%) health care workers, including nurses (0.6%, n = 4), physicians (0.5%, n = 3), and allied personnel (1.5%, n = 10), died from SARS (Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, 2003) .",

To carry out their routine nursing duties, they encountered intense physical and psychological challenges during the SARS epidemic (Chan, 2003; Lo, 2004; Mok, Chung, Chung, & Wang, 2005; Tzeng, 2003) . Moreover, many frontline nurses were the last person to learn of a patient's SARS-related diagnosis and the actual as well as potential dangers inherent in the practice setting; neither were they warned or provided with adequate protection to ensure their safety at an early stage (Mok et al., 2005) . Finally, feelings of being devalued and sacrificed as well as other related complaints came out and were discussed by nurse clinicians and leaders from nursing associations, legislators, and schools of nursing (Hall et al., 2003; Lee & Lin, 2003; Lu, 2003; Nickell et al., 2004; Parish, 2003) .",

Finally, 200 of 266 qualified nurses (75%) expressed interest in participating in this project; because it was difficult to make an appointment with each of them individually, 25 semistructured focus group interviews (6-10 persons per group) were held at each participant's convenience (Lee et al., 2005) .",

The questions for the interview guide and the questionnaires included (a) the respondents' personal profile of their professional and anti-SARS experiences; (b) the semistructured questions related to the difficulties encountered during their precaring stage (starting with the day they were informed to prepare themselves for caring for suspected SARS patients in the near future until the day before their first contact with SARS victims), the tangible caring stage (starting with the first day and ending with the last day of their direct care of suspected SARS patients), and the postcaring stage (the 6-month period starting with the day they no longer had contact with suspected SARS patients until the day they were interviewed for this project); and (c) a background context including conditions/situations and rationales for the identified difficulties. These questions were developed from an extensive literature review, from the PI's empirical anti-SARS experiences, and in consultation with five well-known experts with anti-SARS experience, the Taiwanese culture, and the nursing crisis management programs.

Second, themes framing the background context of the participants' responses were identified, extracted, and discussed. This allowed the influencing factors that contributed to the participants' conceptions of their anti-SARS experiences to be further understood. In this project, the unmet needs of nurse clinicians were a major background theme and framed the difficulties that they encountered across all stages of the SARS epidemic. Finally, a conceptual framework depicting the relationship between the participants' reflections and the attributed background context was developed to have a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the issues discussed.",

Likewise, Hong Kong and Western scholars also pointed out that one of the major difficulties with natural hazards is knowing where to find accurate information and how to coordinate efforts by sharing accurate information in a quick and organized manner (Burkle, 1995; Libman et al., 1997; Mok et al., 2005) . Providing nurses with SARS-related knowledge would decrease uncertainty (Mishel, 1990 (Mishel, , 1997 Mok et al., 2005) and allow them to become involved in making decisions, thus making them aware of alternatives as well as the anticipated consequences of each possible course of action. Libman et al. suggested several strategies for improving medical disaster coordination and communication: (a) use of the Internet and availability of the electronic addresses of people in the areas of health and disaster relief to establish connectivity; (b) establishment of disease telemonitoring capability; (c) building up educational and training programs that are available through the Internet; (d) networking all nongovernment organizations and government agencies before a disaster occurs; and (e) establishment of a disaster information server.",

The need to support the dynamic requirements of nurses in achieving a balance between the nursing profession, family roles, and personal expectations Exposure to a highly contagious environment is a huge workplace stressor (Orji, Fasubaa, Onwudiegwu, Dare, & Ogunniyi, 2002; Tan, 1991; Wu, 1996) . Most nurse clinicians were forced to weigh the serious and imminent health risks to themselves and their families against their professional duty to care for the sick during the initial SARS outbreak. Canadian and Hong Kong staff also reported being fearful for their own and their families' health and found that caring for colleagues as SARS-related patients was emotionally difficult (Maunder et al., 2003; Mok et al., 2005; Nickell et al., 2004) . During the SARS outbreak, the morale of the frontline staff was challenged as they shouldered an increasing clinical load when colleagues contracted the disease (Mok et al., 2005) . The death of four of Taiwan's nurses was a further blow to staff morale. Lee and Lin (2003) described four negative impacts of the SARS crisis on the nursing profession. First, because of the shortage of protective equipment and manpower, nursing staff stayed around the clock working in a high-risk care environment. Second, the low responses and inadequate actions of officials and authorities and the resulting increased stress exhausted the nursing staff both physically and mentally. Third, it became increasingly apparent that the isolation and quarantine procedures resulted in a shortage of nursing manpower. Lastly, it raised additional issues about the education of the next generation of nurses in Taiwan, particularly where it concerns conflicts between nursing ethics and professional identity. When confronted with challenges to one's identity, the specters of self-doubt and insecurity can begin to loom large (Matthews, 2003) . During the early anti-SARS process, the ideal moral concepts held by nurse clinicians and student nurses were challenged, and they began to feel powerless and helpless. Indeed, some of them considered switching careers.",

This will help call attention to the issues of nurses' heavy workload and their need for support and appreciation in times when fighting for public health in critical situations. As stated by the president of Taiwan and the president of the International Council of Nursing, Christine Hancock, the SARS epidemic has highlighted the value and critical importance of nurses and their work everyday and everywhere (International Council of Nurses, 2003; Lo, 2004; Parish, 2003) . The challenges from the SARS epidemic outbreak have not only empowered nurses' crisis management competence but also improved or challenged their appreciation of their self-identity.",

            "text": "From the results of this study, the SARS outbreak ought to have aroused the sensitivity of government officials toward important nursing issues that have long been ignored, including political involvement, manpower, benefits, financial incomes, and so on. There are several reasons why local and national health institutions should invite nurses with disaster management experience to participate in decision making and action plans. First, nurses have invaluable frontline empirical experience as well as immediate and reliable information. Gottlieb (2004) stressed that nurses have always played a key role in case detection, infection control, public education, risk mitigation, and risk containment. Second, nurses form the largest professional group in the health care marketplace; hence, their inputs should be seriously considered and incorporated in the design of institutional missions and policies (Des Jardin, 2001) . Third, a significant part of nurses' responsibility is to act as patient advocates and ensure that patients retain their right to quality care and informed choice. DiGaudio (1993) asserted that the active involvement of nurses in policymaking would lead to better resource allocation. Meanwhile, increased participation would promote nurses' control over their practice and enhance the respect given to nurses as professionals. As such, political and action involvement at the local and national levels will offer nurses various opportunities to influence and seek changes in their workplace and to act as a voice for others.",

It appears that the SARS epidemic highlighted many significant problems not only in contemporary health care delivery systems but also in the interdisciplinary and international health care environments. The value of reciprocity does not only rely on individuals or paperwork: It also needs to be brought about by the support and protection by health institutions of their health care providers (Singer et al., 2003) . Health care providers are expected to deliver services in an atmosphere of utmost integrity that will only occur when providers have courage, feel safe, and are supported to do the right thing in difficult situations (Kerfoot, 1999) . As such, government and health institutes are expected to provide the following forms of help to nurses: (a) offering adequate personal protective material and equipment at all relevant sites; (b) fostering a reciprocal supportive relationship between health team members; (c) offering an accessible counseling \"hotline\" and anti-SARS program to provide timely mutual support and training during quarantine; and (d) providing plausible tangible reimbursement for staff who take extraordinary responsibilities during epidemics and disasters.",

First, face-toface focus group interviews were used as the primary data collection method because the sample included 200 participants. Although significant efforts were made to ensure the rigor of data collection, some participants' private concerns might not have been fully discussed owing to a lack of adequate time or a wish to retain confidentiality. Second, a postinterview self-report questionnaire was used to facilitate the participants' expression of feelings and thoughts that might be confidential to them. Nevertheless, the interactions in focus group interviews might have influenced the responses obtained by 30% of the participants who replied via the questionnaire; this may have modified their original perceptions of their experiences. Lastly, 96% of the participants were female; thus, the perceptions of the difficulties and related background contexts for males might not have been identical. The final point particularly deserves further investigation before drawing comparative conclusions.",
