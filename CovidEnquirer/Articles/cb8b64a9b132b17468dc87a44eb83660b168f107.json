Prior to EMS calls, 2 surfaces were seeded with FX174. On call completion, EMS vehicle and equipment surfaces were sampled before decontamination, after decontamination per current practices, and after implementation of the intervention. Results: Current decontamination practices did not significantly reduce viral loads on surfaces (P \u00bc .3113), but H 2 O 2 wipe intervention did (P \u00bc .0065). Bacteriophage spread to 56% (27/48) of sites and was reduced to 54% (26/48) and 40% (19/48) with current decontamination practices and intervention practices, respectively. Conclusion: Results suggest firefighters' hands were the main vehicles of microbial transfer. Current practices were not consistently applied or standardized and minimally reduced prevalence and quantity of microbial contamination on EMS surfaces. Although use of a consistent protocol of H 2 O 2 wipes significantly reduced percent prevalence and concentration of viruses, training and promotion of surface disinfection should be provided.",

            "text": "Prior studies have identified that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant health and occupational risk to firefighters and medical patients, with numerous cases reported across the nation resulting in severe or fatal outcomes. 1 Previous U.S. studies show that 4.6% (13/280) of EMS personnel and 22.5% (9/40) of firefighters were colonized with MRSA, rates much higher than in the general population (0.8%). [2] [3] [4] [5] Roberts et al 3 determined that 58% of nasal MRSA isolates obtained from fire station personnel were confirmed to be genetically related to environmental surface isolates, suggesting transmission between personnel and the surfaces. Although MRSA has been the primary focus of EMS responder infectious disease transmission studies, the information is relevant to exposure risks from other infectious agents. Fomites have been shown to play a role in transmitting an array of human pathogens either directly by surface-to-mouth or abraded skin contact or indirectly by contamination of fingers and subsequent hand-to-mouth, eyes, nose, and cut or abraded skin contact, suggesting potential infection risk for EMS responders and their patients. 2, 6, 7 In many communities, such as the one in this study, fire services are the first line of response in emergency medical calls. Typically, in U.S. fire services, medic trucks are staffed by a firefighter and a firefighter paramedic and dispatched to scenes to provide medical assistance. The fire engines are staffed by a firefighter engineer, firefighter captain, firefighter paramedic, and a firefighter and dispatched to more serious medical calls and fires. In the most serious emergency calls, both the medic truck and engine are dispatched to the scene. The medic trucks are able to transport patients; however, freestanding ambulatory services often assist the fire department in transporting patients from the scene of an emergency to hospitals. Fire engines and the medical equipment carried in them have not been previously evaluated as reservoirs of potential pathogens. Data on cross-contamination of both of these common EMS vehicles during emergency calls were not available, prior to this study. The current study used a bacteriophage tracer to characterize the cross-contamination within medic trucks, fire engines, and on EMS equipment used during calls to elucidate the exposure potential to EMS responders and patients, and the fomitehand-fomite transmission relationship in an actual field setting. Additionally, current decontamination practices were evaluated and compared with an activated hydrogen peroxide wipe (Clorox Healthcare, Oakland, CA) intervention.",

In phase 2 (September 20, 2012-October 4, 2012), samples were taken after decontamination per current practices. In phase 3 (October 4-8, 2012), samples were taken after the implementation of an activated hydrogen peroxide wipe intervention. During each phase, 58 surface samples were obtained from 5 EMS calls: 3 from engine surfaces and 2 from the medic truck. On arrival to the station, surfaces of the engine and rescue vehicles were disinfected using activated hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) wipes (Clorox Healthcare). Two hard nonporous sites (LIFEPAK handle and EPCR clasp) were seeded with bacteriophage (concentration of approximately 10 8 PFU/mL) using cotton-tipped applicators (Puritan Medical, Guilford, ME) each hour, until the occurrence of an EMS call, to maintain viral loads. The surfaces selected for seeding were chosen because they were not handled by emergency responders until arrival on a scene and therefore represented contamination that may occur during a call. Samples were collected using swabs (3M, Forest City, IA) containing 1 mL of letheen broth to neutralize residual disinfecting chemicals on sampled surfaces. Before the start of the EMS calls, approximately half of each of the seeded surfaces were sampled using letheen broth swabs to obtain the starting concentration of the surfaces (n \u00bc 10 per phase). The additional nonseeded surfaces of interest were also sampled before the start of the EMS calls to ensure bacteriophage contamination of these sites did not occur prior to a call (n \u00bc 48 per phase).

A previous laboratory-based study by Lopez et al 26 reported average fomitefinger transfer efficiencies for poliovirus, E coli, and S aureus as 36.3%, 21.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. With FX174 being most physiologically similar to poliovirus, its transfer efficiencies from fomite to hand and vice versa are likely greater than that of bacteria, which may cause overestimation of rate of transfer for bacteria, such as MRSA, in this study. However, with bacteria likely being more apt to survive on environmental surfaces for much longer periods of time than FX174, it is likely that its greater persistence would eventually lead to greater transfer incidence than that measured in a single laboratory study.",

However, prior to intervention education and training, firefighters only disinfected surfaces when visibly soiled, which is likely why the reduction observed was not significant. In the only other existing study to assess efficacy of current cleaning procedures in emergency vehicles, the total percent reduction of bacteria-positive sites was greater than what was observed in this study at 25.6%, but attributed to researchers using paramedics to swab allocated areas of the vehicle, once before cleaning and once after cleaning, enabling EMS crews to know which sites were of interest. 12 This may have caused them to focus on those sites more rigorously for cleaning and disinfection, which would bias results. In the current study, the firefighters were blinded to which surfaces were being sampled to minimize the potential for information bias. Additionally, researchers accompanied firefighters on calls for several weeks prior to the start of the study in an attempt to lessen the Hawthorne effect, which is the tendency of subjects who know they are being observed to temporarily change their behavior. [31] [32] [33] [34] The viral loads of seeded surfaces were significantly reduced with the introduction of the H 2 O 2 wipe intervention (P \u00bc .0009, Kruskal-Wallis), and the percent of cross-contaminated sites was reduced by 16% (from 27/48 to 19/48). During the intervention phase, firefighters were instructed to use the activated H 2 O 2 wipes on surfaces they recalled handling during the EMS call. Often, sites targeted by researchers within the vehicle (eg, steering wheel, headphones, grab bars, portable radios) were not selected for disinfection by firefighters. Had firefighters been trained on what surfaces to clean and disinfect, the results may have been more pronounced. The amount of virus recovered from these surfaces prior to EMS calls was not significantly different between study days (P \u00bc .3113, Kruskal-Wallis), indicating that significant differences detected in viral loads after the EMS calls were not caused by variability in starting seeded virus concentrations.",

Although it is possible for viruses to be airborne on surface disruption, the physical separation of many of the cross-contaminated additional surfaces of interest from the seeded surfaces suggests that the firefighters' hands were the main vehicles for transfer of the virus. The crosscontamination of surfaces within the emergency response vehicles suggests that the firefighters were exposed to the virus during EMS calls. Although gloves were observed being used during most EMS calls, some of the cross-contaminated surfaces (eg, steering wheel, headphones, EPCR, seatbelt buckles, portable radios) are commonly handled with ungloved hands immediately after the call. The aforementioned sites handled with ungloved hands were contaminated 46.4% (35/69) of the time after EMS calls, during all 3 phases of the study, highlighting the importance of the fomitehand-fomite transmission route.",

Future studies should identify procedures and products to disinfect soft and porous surfaces within the emergency response vehicles and EMS facilities because the porous jumpbag handle had the greatest viral load, even after implementation of the activated H 2 O 2 wipe intervention. EMS vehicle seats and other soft surfaces in the vehicles should be targeted for pathogen sampling, and if necessary, development of sanitizing procedures for soft surfaces in EMS vehicles should be investigated.",

Cross-contamination was detected on a total of 56% (27/48), 54% (26/48), and 40% (19/48) of surfaces predecontamination, after current decontamination practices, and after introduction of the activated H 2 O 2 wipe intervention, respectively. Although gloves were used during EMS calls, the aforementioned sites were sometimes handled with ungloved hands after EMS calls, suggesting microbial exposure to firefighters. This study identified a lack of standardized surface decontamination protocols, and results suggest that current practices only minimally reduce prevalence and quantity of microbial contamination on EMS surfaces. Concentrated effort to develop and evaluate more effective infection control practices in EMS settings should be promoted to reduce potential risk to the health and safety of EMS responders and their patients.",
