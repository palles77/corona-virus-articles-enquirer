            "text": "Physical examination of the cardiovascular system involves examination of mucous membranes for color, refill time, and moistness; thoracic palpation and auscultation, assessment of arterial pulse quality via the median or medial saphenous arteries; assessment of jugular filling; and palpation of the ventrum for edema. Common ancillary tests include blood analysis, blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. The areas suitable for cardiac auscultation lie conveniently within the shortfleeced axilla, under the forelimb above the elbow. On the left side, the pulmonic valve is heard best over the third intercostal space, under the triceps brachii, whereas the aortic valve area is located more dorsally at the fourth intercostal space. The mitral valve area is located more ventrally on the left hemithorax at the costochondral junctions over the fourth or fifth intercostal space, and the tricuspid valve is heard best on the right hemithorax over the fourth intercostal space at the caudal edge of the triceps brachii. Areas over all valves should be palpated for the presence of a thrill. Healthy adult camelids in the Oregon State University herd have resting heart rates between 48 and 72 beats per minute (beats/min), with rare individuals spiking up to 84 beats/min. This range is slightly lower than the 60 to 90 beats/min or higher rates that are sometimes cited. Adults with higher heart rates are likely to be excessively stressed, volume depleted, or otherwise compromised. Neonates typically have heart rates varying from 90 to 120 beats/min, although rates up to 140 beats/min may be found in some newborns. Juveniles typically will have heart rates less than 100 beats/min by age 1 month, and this declines to the adult range by age 1 year. 1 The first and second heart sounds should be heard clearly on the left side of the thorax in all but the most obese camelids. These sounds are more difficult to discern on the right side but should be audible in an adequately restrained camelid in a quiet environment. With careful auscultation, soft third and fourth sounds are discernible in some healthy camelids. Loud S3 or S4 heart sounds are usually indicative of serious cardiac disease, reflecting the presence of ventricular enlargement and ventricular dysfunction. Physiologic and innocent murmurs are often identified in adult and immature camelids. Anemic, systemically ill, and even apparently healthy camelids may exhibit soft, nonpathologic systolic murmurs (\u2264grade 3 of 6) over the left heart base. These murmurs are usually crescendo-decrescendo, ejection-type murmurs occupying midsystole, with preservation of the first and second heart sounds. Scansen and co-workers recently identified highvelocity and turbulent flow in the branch pulmonary arteries of several young crias and offered an elegant explanation for some of the innocent murmurs identified in immature camelids. 2 The murmur and the flow disturbances resolved within a few months, which suggests that this finding is benign, therein resembling the condition of peripheral pulmonary stenosis seen in human infants. Often, however, the precise cause of these soft murmurs is not apparent even with the aid of color flow echocardiographic evaluation.",

            "text": "Loud systolic murmurs are abnormal and may be detected in camelids with septal defects, outflow tract obstructions, and insufficiency of the atrioventricular (AV) valves. The systolic murmur of a ventricular septal defect may be either band shaped or crescendo-decrescendo and is typically best heard on the right side of the chest. Heart murmurs resulting from outflow tract obstruction are typically crescendo-decrescendo or diamond-shaped and are usually best heard at the left heart base. The regurgitant murmurs of AV valve insufficiency are typically band shaped or plateau shaped and are best heard at the left or right apex, depending on the valve affected. Regurgitant murmurs tend to be longer (pansystolic) than systolic ejection murmurs (holosystolic), so both the first and second heart sounds are usually obscured in camelids with AV valve insufficiency. In comparison with horses and dogs, insufficiency of the AV valves occurs much less commonly in llamas and alpacas. Diastolic murmurs are also relatively rare, almost always clinically significant, and are usually caused by insufficiency of the aortic valve, or more rarely, the pulmonic valve. Such murmurs are usually best heard at the heart base on the left side of the thorax. The continuous murmur of a posterior descending artery (PDA) is also best heard at the left heart base as in other species. It is important to recognize that many significant congenital and acquired cardiac lesions in camelids result in no discernible murmur. For example, camelids with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary hypertension may not evidence a murmur but will often have accentuated splitting of the second heart sound because of asynchronous closure of the semilunar valves. Thus, it must be appreciated that auscultation alone is not entirely reliable for ruling out the presence of cardiac disease.",

            "text": "Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are primarily recorded to elucidate the nature of an auscultated rhythm disturbance. A standardized six-lead ECG may be easily obtained in the standing camelid by attaching two electrodes above the olecranon on the forelimbs and the remaining two electrodes just above the patellas on the hindlimbs. Leads are attached with alligator clips and wetted with alcohol. Clipping the fleece is usually not necessary. It is often preferable to obtain ECGs in young crias by restraining them in right lateral recumbency. In either circumstance, ECG tracings are most easily interpreted when a paper speed of 50 millimeters per second (mm/s) is selected for the recording. It is useful to complement the limb leads with a rhythm strip that is recorded by using a base-apex lead; the rhythm strip is obtained by repositioning the right front leg electrode to the base of the neck on the right and by moving the left front leg electrode to a location over the cardiac apex on the left side of the chest. This lead often provides the largest amplitude complexes thereby facilitating cardiac rhythm analysis. 3 Normal ECG reference values for camelids have been reported in several published studies (Figure 36 -1). [4] [5] [6] In the recent report by Kraus and coworkers, heart rate was seen to vary from 60 to 100 beats/min with a mean heart rate of 80 beats/min. 6 The mean (+/\u2212 standard deviation [SD] ) duration of the electrical events were reported as follows: P waves: \u221240 milliseconds (ms; +/\u2212 12); PQ interval: 150 ms (+/\u2212 33); QRS complex: 50 ms (+/\u2212 8); Q-T interval: 360 ms (+/\u2212 60); ST segment: 230 ms (+/\u2212 46). QRS morphology was found to be extremely variable. The mean polarity of the QRS complexes was negative in 60% of the lead I recordings, in 56% of the lead II recordings, and in 51% of the lead III recordings. The QRS complex was least variable for lead V10, where the QRS complexes were positive in 88% of the animals examined. The amplitudes of the R and S waves tended to be low in the limb leads, as often noted in herbivores. Values obtained from mean electrical axis (MEA) estimations were extremely variable but were directed mainly to the right and in a cranial direction. In contrast to humans and small animals, ECG recordings obtained from camelids provide little information about the overall size of the heart or the enlargement of specific chambers. The Purkinje fiber network of camelids penetrates completely through the wall of the ventricles from the endocardium to the epicardium, as in sheep, resulting in a pattern of activation that effectively obscures the hallmarks of chamber enlargement seen in humans and smaller mammals such as the dog and the cat. 4, 7 In our experience, neither the recorded voltage nor the estimated MEA appears to be useful for the detection of chamber enlargement.",

Thoracic radiography is also useful for identifying pleural effusion, its severity, and its likely cause. In this regard, it is complementary to thoracic ultrasonography. In neonates, thoracic radiography is particularly useful for distinguishing heart disease from the far more common pulmonary parenchymal diseases associated with immaturity or infection. It is often possible to obtain lateral and dorsoventral radiographs in young crias, and two-view studies are advisable whenever they can be accomplished without causing undue stress to the animal.

The techniques used to perform echocardiography in camelids do not differ substantially from those used in other large animal species. Low-frequency transducers, ranging from 2 to 3.5 megahertz (MHz), are required to adequately examine adult animals. In crias, either a 5-MHz or a 7.5-MHz transducer provides the necessary resolution required for optimally imaging immature patients. Uncooperative subjects should be sedated if their clinical condition is sufficiently stable. Interrogation of the heart is typically accomplished from a combination of imaging windows located at the ventral aspect of the fourth or fifth intercostal space on the right side of the thorax and at the cardiac apex on the left. To obtain optimal images from the right side, it is very helpful to have the right forelimb positioned as far forward as the animal will accommodate so that the ultrasound transducer can be positioned as far cranial and dorsal as the lung permits. From this location, twodimensional images should be obtained in six short-axis imaging planes through the left ventricle: (1) through the cardiac apex, (2) at the level of the papillary muscles, (3) the chordae tendineae, (4) the mitral valve, (5) the heart base at the level of the aorta and left atrium, and, if possible, (6) at the level of the main pulmonary artery as it bifurcates at the origin of the left and right pulmonary arteries ( Figure 36-4) . Two long-axis imaging planes should be recorded from this same location by rotating the transducer counterclockwise to obtain an image plane that optimizes a view of the left ventricular outflow tract and another imaging plane optimizing a view of all four chambers of the heart together with the mitral and tricuspid valves ( Figure 36 -5) .

Alternatively, two-dimensional imaging may be used to guide the orientation of the M-mode beam to obtain the desired imaging location. Relevant measures of chamber size may be made from either the two-dimensional or M-mode images permitting the calculation of a variety of functional indices. Normal M-mode echocardiographic measures that are available are based on one study of 23 healthy llamas weighing 110 to 166 kg (mean = 138 kg) and another study of 27 healthy alpacas weighing 43 to 101 kg (mean = 68 kg). 3, 10 The reported normal ranges are very wide, reflecting the inclusion of animals with widely differing body weights. M-mode echocardiographic data from a small population of crias (12 alpacas and 5 llamas) were also recently made available. 3 Left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening (%FS), calculated as the % change in LV short-axis diameter from end-diastole to end-systole, is the most commonly used index of systolic function. As a rule of thumb, %FS should be 25% or greater in healthy camelids, regardless of age, breed, or sex. Two-dimensional color flow Doppler imaging is a particularly useful and cost-effective imaging modality for the evaluation of camelids with congenital or acquired heart disease. Not only can the architecture of the heart be easily visualized and accurately measured, but flow disturbances within the heart and great vessels can be easily appreciated and fourth intercostal space. The ratio of heart height to the height of the thorax, both measured along the cardiac long access, ranges from 0.68 to 0.74 in healthy adult llamas, and 0.65 to 0.84 in alpaca crias. 8, 9 Cardiomegaly is usually obvious in camelids with serious heart disease and is typically revealed by an increase in cardiac width beyond three intercostal spaces, an increase in heart height beyond three fourths the height of the thorax, and elevation of the trachea with reduction in the angle of divergence from the thoracic spine below the reported normal range of 10\u00b0 to 19\u00b0 (mean 14.4\u00b0 + 2.0\u00b0) in adult llamas, and 9\u00b0 to 22\u00b0 (mean 14.2\u00b0 + 3.6\u00b0) in alpaca crias. 8, 9 Using a modification of the Buchanan vertebral heart score (VHS) system, Mattoon and colleagues have provided scaled criteria for identifying cardiomegaly in llamas. 8 According to this method, the height plus width of the normal adult llama heart ranges from 7.7 to 9.1 \"vertebral lengths\" (mean VHS = 8.4) or 2.75 to 3.55 times the distance from the cranial aspect of T3 to the caudal aspect of T5. In crias, the ratio of cardiac height plus width to T3-T5 has been reported as 3.12 \u00b1 0.21, which is very similar to adult animals. Left heart enlargement is usually easily identified on the lateral radiograph, but reliable identification of right heart enlargement is often more problematic. In young crias, dorsoventral thoracic radiography allows for more sensitive detection of right heart enlargement. In crias, the mean cardiac height plus width to T3-5 ratio on dorsoventral radiography has been reported as 2.5 \u00b1 0.25 and the cardiac to thoracic width ratio as 0.80 \u00b1 0.06. Ambiguous radiographic findings can often be clarified by an echocardiographic evaluation, which is much more accurate for identifying specific patterns of chamber enlargement.",

            "text": "The pulmonary vasculature should be routinely and systematically evaluated on thoracic radiography, and discrepancies in the absolute and relative size of the arteries and veins should be noted. In young crias, the ratio of the right cranial pulmonary artery to third rib has been reported as 0.42 + 0.11 and the ratio of the right cranial pulmonary vein to third rib as 0.45 + 0.11. In adult llamas, the ratio of the right cranial pulmonary artery to the height of T4 is reported as 0.28 \u00b1 0.04 and the ratio of the right pulmonary vein to the height of T4 as 0.30 \u00b1 0.04. Thus, in normal camelids, the cranial lobar pulmonary veins are similar in size or only slightly larger than the accompanying arteries. Developing left heart failure should be considered when the pulmonary veins are substantially larger than the arteries. When interstitial or alveolar perihilar infiltrates are identified together with enlarged pulmonary veins and an enlarged left atrium, congestive heart failure (CHF) is likely. In animals suspect for congenital heart disease, pulmonary overcirculation, resulting from a left-to-rightshunting PDA or VSD, is typically evidenced by concurrent enlargement of the cranial lobar arteries and veins together, with an overall increase in the opacity of the lungs. Right-toleft shunts, in turn, are usually evidenced by diminutive pulmonary vessels and reduced opacity of the lung fields. Evaluation of caudal vena caval size is also easily accomplished on lateral radiography, and this assessment takes on added importance in camelids when right heart failure is suspected, since jugular venous distension cannot be readily evaluated by physical examination. As a general rule, the diameter of the caudal vena cava should not exceed the height of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebrae. disturbances resulting from aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valvular insufficiency or from a VSD via the right parasternal long axis views (Figure 36-8 ). Echocardiographic imaging from the left apical region on the left side of the chest allows the generation of four-chamber and five-chamber views of the heart, the latter referring to the inclusion of the four cardiac chambers plus the LV outflow tract together with the proximal aorta. This view is particularly useful for evaluating the velocity of blood quantified. Images are initially obtained from the right side of the thorax, where flow disturbances in the vicinity of the pulmonic, aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves can often be appreciated. From this location, accurate flow velocity determinations via spectral Doppler can be achieved only for flow through the pulmonic valve, as such measures require the interrogating ultrasound beam to be parallel with the direction of flow. Nonetheless, it is often possible to document flow ",

            "text": "The most commonly reported abnormalities of the camelid cardiovascular system are congenital heart malformations. Boon and co-workers summarized the prevalence of congenital heart disease in llamas presented for evaluation at Colorado State University (24 of 663 total camelid admissions = 3.6%) and from data obtained from the Veterinary Medical Data Base from 1986 to April 1993 (35 of 2167 = 1.6%). 10 Heart malformations have been reported to comprise 6.4% of all camelid congenital defects and were identified in 2.2% of camelids that were necropsied. 12 It is important to be mindful that a substantial percentage of crias with congenital heart disease have more than one anatomic cardiac defect, emphasizing the need for a meticulous cardiovascular examination. Various reasons have been put forward for the perceived high prevalence of congenital heart disease in camelid populations compared with what is seen in other domestic hoofstock. The most plausible explanations focus on the proposed heritability of most congenital heart defects and the founder effect of a small gene pool for camelids in those countries where sizeable camelid herds have been built up from a relatively limited number of imported camelids, as well as bottlenecks in their native populations. A large variety of congenital heart defects has been described in camelids, including VSD and atrial septal defect (ASD), vascular ring anomalies, endocardial cushion defects, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), pseudotruncus arteriosus, persistent truncus arteriosus, transposition of the great vessels (TGV), pulmonic stenosis, double outlet right ventricle, mitral and tricuspid valve dysplasia, and tricuspid valve atresia. 3, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Nineteen cases of congenital heart disease in llamas were identified from 1980 to 1990 at the University of California, Davis, and of these, 11 had VSDs, 4 had TGV, 2 had ASDs, 1 had ToF, and 1 had PDA (Dr. W.P. Thomas, personal communication). Fifteen cases of congenital heart disease have been identified in alpacas at the Oregon State Veterinary Teaching Hospital over the last 6 years including 4 with VSD, 4 with vascular ring anomaly, 2 with TGV, 1 with pseudotruncus arteriosus, 1 with ToF, 1 with hypoplastic left ventricle, 1 with coronary sinus to right atrial fistula, and 1 flow as it moves away from the transducer while flowing out through the aortic valve. Increased flow velocity usually indicates outflow tract obstruction, but mildly increased flow velocities may also be observed with left-to-right shunts and other causes of increased stroke volume. Quantification of valvular stenosis and insufficiency via the modality of spectral Doppler velocity recordings has supplanted cardiac catheterization as the preferred method for determining disease severity. Transvalvular flow velocities recorded in healthy llamas and alpacas are very similar to those reported for dogs and cats. It is noteworthy that often very small jets of valvular insufficiency are present in the immediate vicinity of all the cardiac valves in healthy camelids, and such observations should not be considered indicative of valve disease. 11 Arterial Blood Gas Analysis ABG analysis is useful for determining whether a suspected cardiac abnormality has led to significant right-to-left shunting of blood. Right-to-left shunting allows deoxygenated venous blood to enter the aorta without passing through the lungs, reducing the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) below reference values. Affected animals have a decreased activity level or tolerance for exercise. To differentiate shunting from other causes of hypoxemia, presupplemental and postsupplemental oxygen concentrations may be compared; shunts prevent an increase in PaO 2 , whereas oxygenation increases with most other causes of hypoxemia. Serial ABG analyses may be used to track failure, as some animals with left-to-right shunts or a mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood entering the aorta will have a worsening of hypoxemia as left heart failure progresses.",

In some affected animals, the point of maximum intensity of the murmur is located at the left heart base, but a right-sided murmur is almost always still identifiable. When the defect is located in the muscular portion of the interventricular septum, the murmur may be heard in a more caudal location on the right side of the thorax near the cardiac apex. On those occasions where aortic insufficiency develops as a consequence of an undermined aortic root, an additional diastolic murmur may be heard in association with the VSD murmur, producing a characteristic \"to and fro\" type of cardiac murmur.

All chambers of the heart are enlarged, but the right side is often enlarged to the extent that it provides the apex of the heart. Severe systolic dysfunction is typically present and pulmonary hypertension may also be evident. Although one llama appears to have survived adequately for 1 year at less than 300 meters (m) above sea level, other affected camelids have shown clinical signs at a young age. Once clinical signs develop, the affected animal usually dies or is euthanized within a few weeks or months. Interestingly, one affected 2-year-old llama began to show signs only after spending a year at high altitude. Diuretics have been used to palliate the clinical signs, but they do not have much effect on the progression of the disease or the eventual outcome. The occurrence of this defect in two related camelids raises the likelihood of a genetic cause, but the heritability of this defect remains speculative. ToF is another well documented cyanosis-producing cardiac defect occurring in camelids and is characterized by pulmonary stenosis with hypoplasia of the pulmonary arteries, a high VSD, an enlarged and dextropositioned aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. This constellation of findings is the result of maldivision of the conotruncal septum during embryonic development. Extreme variants of this abnormality include those cases in which the pulmonic valve and the main pulmonary artery are completely atretic, creating the appearance of a \"pseudo\" truncus arteriosus ( Figure 36-11 ). In such cases, pulmonary perfusion is accomplished by a PDA connecting the aorta to the right and left pulmonary arteries. Acyanotic forms of ToF are also seen when the pulmonic stenosis lesion is mild and right ventricular systolic pressures are not elevated above the pressure in the left ventricle. Echocardiography is particularly useful for identifying the complex anatomy of all the components of these complex congenital heart defects. Effective treatment requires surgical repair of the observed defects and, to our knowledge, this has not been accomplished in camelids.",

Ostium secundum ASDs develop in the middle of the interatrial septum, in the region of the fossa ovalis, and are the most common type of ASD. Sinus venosus ASDs occur in the uppermost region of the interatrial septum, typically in association with anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. In crias, the foramen ovale is patent at birth and usually closes within the first 2 weeks of life. In the absence of cardiac enlargement, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is generally regarded to be of little consequence, as the higher left atrial pressure results in physiologic closure of this potential communication between the atria. Significant shunting across a PFO only becomes problematic when another cardiac disorder causes an increase in atrial pressure and atrial enlargement sufficiently severe to allow shunting similar to that seen with a small secundum type ASD. We have also seen a 12-year-old alpaca with a PFO and bilateral CHF, in which we suspected the defect may have played a contributory role to the severity of its condition.",

Such murmurs are the result of an increased stroke volume passing through the right ventricular outflow tract rather than the quiescent shunting of blood within the atria. Fixed splitting of the second heart sound may sometimes be noted and is a useful clue to the presence of an ASD. Right-to-left shunting through a PFO may be seen in crias with pulmonary and tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary and tricuspid atresia, and other congenital heart defects resulting in elevated right atrial pressure. Small and even moderatesized ASDs are generally well tolerated. Clinical signs are uncommon unless the defect is quite large or accompanied by other cardiac abnormalities.

This anomaly is often accompanied by aberrant origination of the right subclavian artery (Figure 36-15 ). The more familiar right aortic arch with constricting left ligamentum has also been observed. In those cases with a PDA, the size of the shunt was small, and a continuous murmur was only noted in one affected alpaca. Most affected animals presented at ages 3 to TGV has been documented in both llamas and alpacas on multiple occasions, yet this disorder is very uncommon in other domesticated animals. In this condition, the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle and the aorta arises from the right ventricle (Figures 36-12 and 36-13) . This anatomic arrangement is not compatible with life unless some of the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs is able to pass from the left to the right side of the heart via an intracardiac communication or from the pulmonary artery to the aorta via a PDA. A variety of other cardiac malformations, including abnormalities of the coronary arteries, may also be identified. Affected individuals are always severely cyanotic at birth, and they usually survive only a short period. Other complex cyanosis-producing cardiac abnormalities, including with swallowed and regurgitated food. On occasion, the development of clinical signs may be delayed until early adulthood. Routine thoracic radiography often demonstrates a dilated esophagus both cranial and caudal to the heart base, sometimes with retained ingesta. It is sometimes possible to 5 months, and the clinical signs were largely attributable to constriction of the esophagus. Dysphagia, abnormal regurgitation, choke, bloat, and failure to thrive are common clinical signs. Cough may also occur as a consequence of tracheobronchitis or pneumonia caused by inoculation of the airways identify a persistent right aortic arch on a dorsoventral thoracic radiograph, but other vascular ring malformations may easily escape detection. Esophagoscopy, contrast esophagography, or fluoroscopy may be performed to confirm the stenotic lesion in the esophagus at the heart base (see Figure 36 -15), but visualization of the vascular malformation responsible for the constriction is best accomplished by using angiography or contrastenhanced computed tomography (CT). Inasmuch as the surgical approach to attempt repair is dependent on the precise nature of the malformation, consideration should be given to sophisticated imaging studies whenever surgical repair is contemplated. Surgical repair has been attempted, but success has been limited, partially because of concurrent aspiration pneumonia.",

Thevetia has similar toxins, including thevetin A and thevetin B. These glycosides are present in the highest concentrations during the plant's flowering period and are not lost during drying. They act as digitalis analogs, inhibiting the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. Intracellular potassium declines, and calcium increases. Myocardial cells lose their resting potential, pacemaker function, and eventually all electrical functions. Enterohepatic circulation of toxins leads to extended effects.

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is not used as much as in other species because the elliptical shape of camelid erythrocytes has an inconsistent effect on automated analysis. On the basis of these indices and published reference values, anemia appears to be a common, albeit subjective, finding in New World camelids. The subjectivity comes from the fact that most published reference ranges related to red blood cell (RBC) or hemoglobin mass appear to be more generous at the upper end of the range and less so at the lower end, where the bulk of the camelids seen at my practice lie. The low end of published values for PCV are generally 27% to 30%, the higher end of the range is approximately 39% to 45%, and the midpoint is around 35%. [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] In contrast, 75% of our clinic population has initial PCV values between 20% and 30%, with less than half over 27%, and only 10% have PCV values above burning oleander, identification of the leaves in ingesta, or two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography or liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy of gastric (C1) contents for oleandrin. Chromatography may also be performed on urine or colonic contents, but using these samples for testing appears to be less sensitive. However, obtaining gastric contents from a severely ill camelid may have life-threatening consequences, so less invasive sample collection may ultimately be advisable. Toxin has also been detected in human blood. 46 If chromatography is unavailable, oleandrin also cross-reacts on digitalis radioimmunoassays. On physical identification of macerated leaves, it is helpful to look for the distinctive parallel secondary veins. These veins are less regular and at a more acute angle to the central vein on Eucalyptus leaves.",

The standard characteristics used to evaluate this in other species, including the presence of reticulocytosis, metarubricytosis, polychromasia, or anisocyotosis, may be seen in camelids with nonregenerative anemia, and even in healthy, nonanemic camelids. 54 Megalocytic or megaloblastic anemias appear to be rare and are difficult to discern because of the problems with MCV measurement. Even in the face of moderate to severe anemia, the magnitude of the regenerative response is often underwhelming. Once PCV drops below approximately 13% in clinical cases, the regenerative process often appears to be arrested altogether. In experimental trials of anemia induced experimentally through whole blood removal, metarubricytosis increases to only 20 per 100 white blood cells (WBCs; high normal = 3 per 100 WBCs), and reticulocytosis increases to only 1.5% (high normal = 0.6%). 55, 56 Some individual animals on these experimental trials remained anemic for at least 3 months in spite of having no known reason for suppressed regeneration.

In most cases, the mechanism of anemia is difficult to verify, and erythrocyte indices are within reference ranges. Blood loss may be external or internal, with internal parasites such as Mycoplasma haemolamae, Eimeria, liver flukes, and gastric nematodes the most common culprits. [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] The importance of Haemonchus contortus, in particular, has been recognized in recent years, particularly with increasing concerns of anthelmintic resistance among GI nematodes. Haemonchosis is the most common cause in our area for PCV less than 10% in camelids; GI neoplasms, and mycoplasmosis are rarer causes. External examination for wounds, lice, ticks, and lymphadenopathy, fecal examination for internal parasites, and blood film examination for mycoplasmosis should be performed in cases of unexplained anemia, and bone marrow analysis should be considered with chronic anemia. Fluorescent staining methods are used to distinguish Haemonchus from other strongyle-type egg producers (see Chapter 5) . It also must be kept in mind that blood-sucking by Haemonchus females starts with the L4 larvae, meaning that anemia can occur during the prepatent period. Each female worm ingests approximately 0.05 ml of blood per day; every 1000 worms ingest approximately 1.4% of an adult alpaca's blood volume each day. Other internal parasites are rarely associated with anemia of this severity, but are commonly seen in camelids with PCV between around 15% and 25%. Significant non-parasitic GI bleeding has been seen with lymphoma or carcinoma, ulcerative gastritis caused by ingestion of sand or hair, and copper 35%. Similar results may be obtained for erythrocyte counts and hemoglobin concentrations. Thus, either a high proportion of our clinic population is anemic, or reference values inappropriately indicate that most North American camelids have values at the low end or slightly below reference values.",

This may be explained by the following apparent anomaly: A roughly linear relationship appears to exist between PCV or erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in camelids except that hemoglobin concentration appears to plateau above 10 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) as PCV declines through the twenties and erythrocyte count declines from about 13 to 10 \u00d710 6 cells per microliter (cells/\u00b5L).

            "text": "Given the lack of specific clinical signs, the clinician usually becomes aware of the presence of anemia in a patient after determination of PCV or a complete CBC. The indications for these blood tests are varied, but something usually alerts the handler or veterinarians that all is not right. Clinical evidence of weakness, lethargy, tractability, or anorexia are common but usually more reflective of a primary disease process than of anemia. In rare cases, anemia is the primary disorder, and membrane pallor may be present and noted. This means of detection is likely to become more common as color qualitative systems such as FAMACHA (Faffa Malan Chart) become more popular. The next step is assessing severity and significance. PCV values between approximately 20% and the lower end of the reference range, or hemoglobin values greater than 10 mg/dL are so common among unthrifty or ill camelids that they are unlikely to be of any great significance or require any special diagnostics or treatment beyond a normal ill-thrift evaluation. Once these lower thresholds are surpassed, it may be worth performing a PCV-to-protein calculation. When PCV is 20% or less, if blood loss is the primary problem, the PCV should be approximately 8.7 to 10.8 times the plasma albumin concentration (in mg/dL) and 4 to 15.4 times the plasma total protein concentration (in mg/dL). Ratios less than this tend to reflect disproportionate protein loss and indicate the need recumbency, and weight loss, to acute collapse and death. Advanced clinical signs often correlate with high levels of parasitemia and anemia but also may be the result of some concurrent disorder. The interplay between mycoplasmosis and other disease is an ongoing question. Immunosuppression is thought to facilitate severe parasitemia but may also be the result of parasitemia. Camelids showing severe anemia or signs should generally be investigated for the presence of another disorder such as immunodeficiency, and treatment of that disorder should accompany any treatment for mycoplasmosis. Specific factors identified as contributing to heavy parasitemia include weather stress, heavy GI parasite loads, immune suppression or deficiency (juvenile llama immunodeficiency syndrome, corticosteroid administration, Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection, or debilitation caused by another disease. 60, 65, 69 Diagnosis is made by identification of the parasite on blood film examination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The parasites are 0.5 to 1 micrometer (\u00b5m) in diameter, coccoid, rod shaped, or ring shaped and may be seen singly, in pairs, or in clumps. They tend to gather at the periphery of erythrocytes but may also be seen free in the plasma or overlying the middle of erythrocytes (where the ring-form is most common). They may be seen with Diff-Quick stain, but show up better with Giemsa stains. They must be differentiated from stain precipitate or Howell-Jolly bodies; the Howell-Jolly bodies should be within the erythrocytes. Blood smears should be made as soon as possible after the sample draw and preferably before refrigeration because the parasites fall off the erythrocytes quickly. 59 Only a few or all erythrocytes may be parasitized.",

            "text": "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemolamae (formerly Eperythrozoon) is a well-recognized blood parasite of New World camelids. It was first identified in llamas in North America in 1988 and has since been identified in most countries where New World camelids are raised. 58, 59 It has been found in llamas, alpacas, and guanacos, and vicu\u00f1a are presumed to be susceptible as well. 58, 59, 62, 68 Recent work has revealed it to be a close relation to M. suis of pigs and more distantly related to the hemotropic bacteria of cattle (M. wenyonii), and other hemotropic mycoplasma (hemoplasmas). 57 The hemoplasmas are gram-negative bacteria that lack a cell wall. They attach to the wall of erythrocytes with microfibrils, causing slight depressions at the site of adherence, but do not appear to penetrate host cells. They are presumed to cause disease through glucose consumption, activation of an inflammatory or immune response, and accelerated removal of parasitized erythrocytes by the reticuloendothelial system. Prevalence of infection in various populations has been estimated to range from approximately 10% to 20%. 62, 67, 68 The mode of transmission is unknown. Biting insects may play a role, and the identification of infection in presuckling neonates suggests that vertical transmission may also occur. 63 Most infected camelids show no clinical abnormalities beyond episodic parasitemia. If one infected camelid is identified in a herd, it is likely that others are infected as well, often with varying degrees of illness, including some in apparent good health. It has been seen in camelids of all ages, including neonates less than 1 day old. 63 Those that are ill may show anything from mild signs, including progressive lethargy, long-lived in camelids, that is, transfusions are more than just an emergency procedure. Routinely transfusing camelids with PCV at 12% or less and occasionally transfusing when the PCV is between 13% and 16% appears to be a reasonable strategy. Chemically stabilized, purified bovine hemoglobin offers another alternative. A current commercial product has seen limited use and appears to be safe and effective. 79 Blood transfusions in camelids are relatively easy and well tolerated. Reactions are rare, so cross-matching is frequently skipped. Most larger New World camelids such as llamas may serve as donors for other New World camelids; the use of camel donors for this purpose has not been evaluated or described. Taking up to about 1 L per 75 kg of body weight from the donor appears to be well tolerated. This represents approximately 20% of the donor's blood. A sterile catheter or bleeding needle is placed into the donor's jugular vein, which is occluded ventral to the site, and the blood is allowed to flow into bottles or bags containing 100 mL of acid citrate dextrose solution or sodium citrate solution (3.25%) per liter. When the jugular is manually held off, a 1 L bag fills in about 15 minutes or less.",

Evidence of illthrift, a decrease in serum iron concentration (<70 microgram per liter [mcg/L]) and clinical improvement after the administration of iron are supportive. Iron dextran (5-8 mg/kg, SQ, q7 days) appears to be an effective treatment. Adverse reactions to the injection appear to be rare, but appropriate warning of the client is warranted. Copper deficiency may be primary or secondary. Affected camelids also usually show evidence of ill-thrift and possibly neurologic signs. Hematologic changes include decreases in hemoglobin and MCHC. Demonstrating hypocupremia, inadequate dietary copper or high concentrations of antagonizing substances is confirmatory. Injectable coppers may be used with caution. With most nutritional deficiencies, anemia shows little evidence of a regenerative response, but hematocrit rebounds over several weeks after treatment.",

Mild to moderate anemia may require no additional treatment beyond addressing what is perceived to be the causative disorder. However, the persistence of anemia after the insult is gone is troubling and may indicate the need for some intervention. Modest interventions include dietary mineral supplements, high-quality nutrition, and an effective parasite control strategy.

In rare cases, affected llamas die of acute sepsis prior to the development of weight loss or chronic disease. Occasionally, a herd history of similar cases exists, potentially in related camelids. The most common time for identification is at ages 10 to 12 months, with llamas as young as 2 months and as old as 3 years identified. 60, [85] [86] [87] [88] Colostral or transfused antibody may play a role in preventing disease signs over the first several months of life.

Serum iron concentration and total iron binding capacity are low or at the low end of the normal range. WBC counts and fibrinogen may be high or low and appear to relate to whether the llama is currently fighting an infection and the nature of that infection.

This challenge was complicated by the lack of knowledge or tools available to investigate camelid immune function at the time of presumptive peak prevalence of JLIDS. The disease was initially defined by lack of sufficient antibody response to vaccination against Clostridium perfringens types C and D. Unfortunately, that test is not currently available for camelids, to our knowledge, and a major attempt to screen a large healthy llama population using this technique failed to reveal new cases. Flow cytometric studies by a different group suggested that camelids with JLIDS have extremely low circulating B-cell counts and led to the suggestion of an autosomal recessive genetic defect, but the use of flow cytometry to identify new cases prospectively has not been reported. 89 A reduced stimulation index to Streptococcus protein A on lymphocyte blastogenesis assay also supports the role of B-cell dysfunction. 86 Most of the signs associated with JLIDS may also be caused by a host of other diseases, some of which may be present in llamas with JLIDS. Hence JLIDS is easy to miss, especially when diagnostic efforts cease upon identification of one of these complicating factors. The occurrence over time of compatible disease signs in related llamas, chronicity of signs, or the refractory nature of identified infectious or parasitic diseases provide evidence that an underlying immune defect may be present and justify further diagnostics.",

Some camelids also develop pleural or peritoneal effusions that may contain neoplastic cells. Cytologic examination of bone marrow may be useful for diagnosing the neoplasm in camelids without palpable lymphadenopathy, and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid may be helpful in camelids with neurologic deficits. Definitive diagnosis is made through histopathologic examination of tissue or cytologic evaluation of a body fluid. Tru-cut biopsy samples are sufficient, whereas interpretation of fineneedle aspirates is often problematic because of poor preservation of neoplastic cells. The biopsy should be taken from a peripheral mass or, if necessary, from an internal organ. Usually, the tumors occur in multiple sites, including lymph nodes, liver, renal cortices, spleen, lungs, heart, bone marrow, gastrointestinal organs, uterus, and the spinal canal.

Ingestion of contaminated feeds or infected milk may be another route of interspecies transmission. 110 After initial inoculation, camelids may be febrile, lethargic, and anorexic for a week or more. 111 They have an acute local reaction, which may be obscured by fleece, and neutrophilic leukocytosis. The malaise, fever, and leukocytosis are often gone by the time of clinical identification, and the acute local reaction is replaced by subcutaneous swelling, possibly draining pus out of a fistula. 109 With time, ill-thrift might develop; with mammary infection, poor growth of offspring might be noted. The most common sites for externally palpable abscesses are around the head, associated with major lymph nodes, and in the mammary gland. External abscesses may break open and drain intermittently.

Unlike in sheep, abscess contents are relatively liquid and drain readily. Because of the herd implications of identifying this specific infection, more specific diagnostics are usually warranted. Bacteriologic cultures on discharges or aspirates from lesions may be performed to grow and identify the organism, but open lesions are often contaminated, and C. pseudotuberculosis does not grow readily from all lesions. The PCR test may enhance speed and sensitivity but is not widely available. A number of serologic tests have been examined in small ruminants as well, but most have issues with sensitivity, specificity, or both. Hemolysis inhibition testing and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against cell wall components have been reported in alpacas. 109, 111 In small ruminants, culling is usually the treatment of choice, based on the refractory nature of this disease to treatment, the high rate of internal abscesses, and the likelihood that infected animals are worsening environmental contamination. In camelids, individual animal treatments are more common. Affected camelids should be isolated, especially if they have open wounds or a draining mammary abscess. When possible, subcutaneous abscesses should be removed en bloc. It this is not possible, they may be opened and cleaned frequently with disinfectants. On the basis of South American data, ultrasonographic or cross-sectional imaging of the perirenal lymph node area should be considered, as these tests would have the highest likelihood of finding an internal mass. The mammary gland should also be examined closely in female camelids. Antibiotics should be considered, particularly those of the penicillin class. However, although C. pseudotuberculosis may appear sensitive to many antibiotics in the laboratory, clinical response is often poor. Intracellular or sepsis, initial antibiotic choice should provide broad-spectrum coverage, including anaerobes. Combinations of a penicillinclass drug and an aminoglycoside are the most popular protocol, once the camelid is adequately hydrated. Other treatments may include general supportive care, fluids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, or endotoxin binders, as needed, as well as appropriate treatment for organ specific signs or underlying diseases. Prognosis is better if sepsis is acute, the camelid still appears principally fit, and any underlying process is temporary. It is worse with drawn out diseases, weak or recumbent camelids, or those showing major dysfunction of any particular organ system. Most of the organisms of sepsis are opportunists, so preventing the predisposing diseases and recognizing and treating them early are the best defenses.",

These concerns were originally based on evidence of seroconversion in camelids in South America and the occurrence of vague illnesses, including apparent immunodeficiency, in North America. 129, 130 Of further concern was the increasing knowledge that nonruminant hosts such as the white-tailed deer could serve as BVDV vectors and reservoirs. 131 BVDV was isolated on rare occasions from llamas and alpacas with upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, or ill-thrift, and linked through maternal or fetal titers to reproductive failures. [131] [132] [133] These infections appeared to be transient, leading to short-term seroconversion and viral shedding. Experimental efforts to model the disease through intranasal infections with various strains of BVDV including type 1a, type 1b, and type 2, consistently revealed that adult camelids developed viremia and nasal shedding after infection but that these were transient, lasting less than 10 to 13 days, and accompanied by minimal to no clinical signs. 134, 135 Concerns about persistence of infection in camelid herds, particularly in association with reproductive failures, and supported by the 2002 report of isolation of BVDV type 1b from a fetus, could not be substantiated using BVD Type 1a. 134, 136 On the basis of these findings, each incident of natural infection was presumed to arise from a new cross-over event from a ruminant or other noncamelid host.",

False-negative results on these tests have arisen from true neonates, in which maternal antibody is thought to interfere for up to 12 weeks, particularly with virus isolation. Serologic tests often yield negative results from persistently infected animals but are often positive in herdmates, especially the dam and other contact animals. Some crias with seropositivity may be chronically infected and thus may serve as a source of infection for herdmates. 145 Serologic testing of representative animals is a good initial screening test for whether a herd has been exposed or not. Ear-notch immunohistochemistry is positive in some cases. Postmortem tests are the same as in acutely infected animals except that the virus is usually more widespread.

A similar exposure window is postulated for camelids, with presumptive infection occurring around 65 to 70 days of pregnancy in some reports, around 70 to 80 days in one experimental trial, and between 64 and 114 days during one outbreak. 137, 138, 144, 145 Infections before that period may lead to embryonic death and infection after that period may lead to abortion, stillbirth, or premature underweight birth, and it is possible that the window for development of persistent infection is wider than has been confirmed experimentally. If the fetus is infected during the appropriate window, it also develops viremia and widespread tissue distribution of the virus but does not develop an antibody titer. It remains infected lifelong, potentially suffering illness and also serving as a source of infection for herdmates. To date, over 60 crias in the United States are thought to have been born persistently infected. In one study, 25% of the tested U.S. alpaca herds had at least one seropositive cria, and 6% had at least one persistently infected cria, indicating that exposure to BVDV is relatively common and that the risk for developing persistently infected crias is real. 146 Clinical signs described in the recent outbreaks include transient bouts of lethargy and anorexia in adults, followed weeks to months later by abortions or stillbirths. Crias born during or after outbreaks may be born early and underweight, or appear normal. 145 A small percentage may have abnormally thin, coarse (\"Suri-like\") fleece or congenital neurologic deficits (circling, hyperesthesia), and some rapidly develop poor growth and evidence of infectious disease, including chronic ocular or nasal discharge, pneumonia, or diarrhea. Others remain healthy for several months or longer before showing signs. Clinicopathologic examination of persistently infected crias may reveal mild anemia, monocytosis, and hypoferremia. Sixty-four percent of persistently infected crias do not survive beyond 1 year.",
