In recent years, several antiviral drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials; however, no registered antivirals have been approved for clinical therapy. In this study, we established a high-throughput screening (HTS) system based on CHIKV 26S mediated insect cell fusion inhibition assay. Our screening system was able to search potential anti-CHIKV drugs in vitro. Using this system, four compounds (niclosamide, nitazoxanide, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid) were identified. These compounds were then further analyzed using a microneutralization assay. We determined that niclosamide and nitazoxanide exhibit ability to against CHIKV-induced CPE. The anti-CHIKV abilities of these compounds were further confirmed by RT-qPCR and IFA. Moreover, niclosamide and nitazoxanide were found to (1) limit virus entry, (2) inhibit both viral release and cell-to-cell transmission, and (3) possess broad anti-alphavius activities, including against two clinical CHIKV isolates and two alphaviruses: Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semliki forest virus (SFV). In conclusion, our findings suggested that niclosamide and nitazoxanide were able to inhibit CHIKV entry and transmission, which might provide a basis for the development of novel human drug therapies against CHIKV and other alphavirus infections.",

During this outbreak, the virus was also transmitted to south India (Parola et al., 2006) and southern Europe, including Italy and France (Gould et al., 2010; Rezza et al., 2007) . Furthermore, the Carribean has been affected by an outbreak of chikungunya disease since December 2013, and the virus has become a public health threat in central America (Weaver and Forrester, 2015) . Together, the two aforementioned outbreaks has led to hundreds of deaths and caused more than one million people to fall ill (Mavalankar et al., 2007; Weaver and Forrester, 2015) . Symptoms of chikungunya disease include high fever, arthritis, arthralgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, and conjunctivitis. Some patients also suffer from severe joint pain for weeks or months (Burt et al., 2012; Weaver and Lecuit, 2015) .",

Upon entry, the endosome undergoes acidification, which can lead to conformational changes in CHIKV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 (Voss et al., 2010) . Envelop glycoproteins then form trimers, which cause the viral membrane and the endosome membrane to fuse together, forming a pore (i.e. the fusion phase) (van Duijl-Richter et al., 2015) . The viral genome is then released into the cytosol.",

            "text": "The CHIKV RNA includes 49S genomic RNA and 26S subgenomic RNA. The 49S genomic RNA encodes four non-structural proteins which are responsible for viral genome synthesis (i.e. genome synthesis). CHIKV envelope glycoproteins and capsid proteins are translated by 26S subgenomic RNA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then are delivered into Golgi apparatus for further processing and glycosylation. Those structural proteins form the spike complexes pE2-E1, which are transported to the plasma membrane. Finally, the spike complexes are assembled with the nucleocapsid cores (Schwartz and Albert, 2010; van Duijl-Richter et al., 2015) ; and the viruses bud out and release to become mature virions (i.e. the release phase). CHIKV can also be spread through cell-to-cell transmission, which allows virions to efficiently avoid attacks from the host immune system (Hahon and Zimmerman, 1970) . Antiviral drugs are developed to disrupt the life cycle of virus. As indicated, the four main steps of viral multiplication include binding, fusion, genome synthesis, and transmission (including release and cell-to-cell transmission) (Abdelnabi et al., 2015; Parashar and Cherian, 2014) . Virus fusion is a critical step of CHIKV infection. The fusion process is dependent on low-pH and the presence of cholesterol (Kuo et al., 2011) ; (Kuo et al., 2012) . Similar findings have been reported for the Sindbis virus (SINV) and the Semliki forest virus (SFV) (Boggs et al., 1989; Chanel-Vos and Kielian, 2004; Kempf et al., 1987; Lanzrein et al., 1993) . Therefore, fusion inhibitors are potential candidates for anti-CHIKV drugs. In this report, we described the use of an CHIKV 26S mediated insect cell fusion inhibition assay that uses baculovirus-based expression as a high-throughput screening (HTS) system to search for novel anti-CHIKV drugs (Macarron et al., 2011) . We also discussed the effects and mechanisms of two potential anti-CHIKV candidates, niclosamide and nitazoxanide. Our results suggested that the antiviral properties of niclosamide, and nitazoxanide made them promising compounds for further development of anti-CHIKV drugs.",

Depending on assay design, intracellular CHIKV RNA was used to determine the effects of test compounds on virus binding (pre-infection, pre), virus entry (during infection, co) and viral genome replication (post-infection, post). Moreover, a TCID 50 assay conducted during the post-infection stage was used to quantify extracellular CHIKV progeny (i.e. viral release). Niclosamide treatment during infection (co) significantly reduced the intracellular CHIKV RNA level (Fig. 5B) . Moreover, the production of extracellular CHIKV progeny was significantly reduced when cells were treated with niclosamide both during and post-infection stages (Fig. 5C ). Above results implied that niclosamide could affect both virus entry and release. Nitazoxanide also decreased the intracellular CHIKV RNA level when it was added during infection (co) and post-infection (post) (Fig. 5B ). Besides, nitazoxanide was able to suppress the production of CHIKV progeny during the post-infection stage (Fig. 5C ). Previous studies indicated nitazoxanide with the antiviral activity in post infection of influenza A virus and rotavirus (Rossignol, 2014) . Nitazoxanide might affected influenza A virus assembly (Rossignol et al., 2009) and rotavirus replication (La Frazia et al., 2013) . Our data also suggested that nitazoxanide might possess inhibition abilities against virus entry, genome synthesis and virus release.",

Cell-to-cell transmission is considered an important transmission pathway and allows viruses to avoid attacks by immune system. Previous studies indicated that CHIKV structural proteins might involve not only in virus binding and fusion but also virus release (Masrinoul et al., 2014) and cell-to-cell transmission (Lee et al., 2011) . Our previous study indicated that suramin was able to inhibit virus entry, fusion, release and cell-to-cell transmission (Ho et al., 2015) . The above data had proved that niclosamide and nitazoxanide were able to inhibit virus entry and release. Furthermore, niclosamide and nitazoxanide were tested and found to significantly suppress cell-to-cell transmission of CHIKV infection. This study is the first to demonstrate that those two compounds can inhibit the cell-to-cell transmission of CHIKV infection.",

Further investigated those two compounds can affect CHIKV entry and transmission and also possess broad anti-alphaviruses abilities. Niclosamide and nitazoxanide could be used for the development of anti-CHIKV or antialphavirus drugs in the future. Formulation altering or combining with other anti-CHIKV drugs were able to improve drug efficacy and reduce their dosage. Besides, through structure modification to find some novel derivatives was also another way to develop safe and efficacious anti-CHIKV drugs.",

Conversely, for nitazoxanide, EC 50 values were between 1.96 and 4.95 mM in different CHIKV strains, while EC 50 values in SINV and SFV were 1.53 and 3.56 mM, respectively. The selectively index (SI) for this drug was between 5.05 and 16.34. The cytopathic effect of BHK-21 cells infected with SINV(Fig. S2A)and SFV(Fig. S3A)were further observed but not appeared under the treatment of niclosamide or nitazoxanide.
