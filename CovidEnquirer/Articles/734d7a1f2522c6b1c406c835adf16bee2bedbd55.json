            "text": "Objectives: Inappropriate use of antibiotics is associated with development of antimicrobial resistance. In respiratory infections it is often difficult to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, and empirical treatment is common. Enhanced viral testing is expected to clarify clinical decision-making and reduce the prescription of antibacterial agents, but the impact of such information on patient care is unclear. Methods: We conducted a (1:1) randomized controlled clinical trial involving 998 adults with respiratory symptoms, fever, chest pain or poor general condition in the emergency unit of a tertiary hospital. Multiplex PCR results for 496 patients were available in 24 hours (intervention group) and those for the remaining 502 patients were available in 7 days (control group). Our primary outcome measures were the duration of hospitalization and the consumption of antibiotics within 30 days of enrolment. Results: In all, 841 of 998 (84%) patients had respiratory symptoms at study entry. A respiratory virus was detected in 175 (17.5%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 4.2 days (SD 5.4) in the intervention group and 4.1 days (SD 4.9) in the control group (difference 0.1, 95% CI e0.5 to 0.6, p 0.810). The mean days on antibiotics were 11.3 days (SD 12.6) in the intervention group and 10.4 days (SD 11.4) in the control group (difference 0.9, 95% CI e0.6 to 2.4, p 0.235). Conclusions: Multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses with results available within 24 hours did not reduce the consumption of bacterial antibiotics or the length of hospital stay in adults presenting with respiratory symptoms, fever, chest pain or reduced general condition in acute care.

Active diagnosis of respiratory pathogens has been proposed as one potential solution to this problem. However, in our randomized controlled trial, the knowledge of the results of multiplex respiratory virus testing did not reduce antimicrobial consumption in adults in acute care.

In one randomized controlled trial in the UK, adult patients presenting at hospital with acute respiratory illness or fever were randomized into two groups, for either a molecular point-of-care test for respiratory viruses or routine care. Over 80% of the patients in both groups received antibiotics and the mean duration of antibiotics remained unchanged [14] . Also, when viral detection was combined with serum procalcitonin (PCT) measurement and an algorithm for interpreting the PCT results was provided there was no significant difference in antibiotic use [15] . However, a subgroup analysis in this randomized controlled trial conducted with individuals with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections in a US community hospital showed shorter duration of antibiotic treatment in the algorithm-adherent patients, and fewer patients with positive viral testing and low PCT values were discharged with antibiotics. A large randomized trial of 1656 patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, covering 14 US urban academic hospitals obtained the same result. There was no difference in days on antibiotics or in adverse events between the standard care group and the intervention group, which had an additional viral testing and PCT measurement provided with graded recommendations for antibiotic use based on PCT levels [16] . In a Canadian quasi-experimental before-and-after study combining virology testing with an antimicrobial stewardship intervention, a 1.3-day decrease in mean days on antibiotics was noted compared with the previous year [17] . Without counselling, physicians seem to respond less to positive viral results other than influenza and rely more on radiographic findings when deciding on antibiotic treatment, as shown in a prospective observational study conducted in a Canadian tertiary hospital [18] .",

In an observational study of Medicare patients aged 65 years, mortality among hospitalized individuals with community-acquired pneumonia was 11% [21] . The incidence of pneumonia rose five-fold and mortality was doubled as age increased from 65e69 years to >90 years [21] . A secondary analysis of the EPIC study, in which in-hospital deaths of pneumonia patients were evaluated, noted that only 2.2% of the patients died in tertiary hospitals but 63.4% of these were at least 65 years old and 61.5% had at least two co-morbidities [22] .

There were subgroups with more positive results, however, in that 34% of the patients tested for influenza had some respiratory virus detected. Influenza-like symptoms have been associated with more positive virus detections in other studies as well [23] . Even though 31%e 39% of our participants with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a virus detected, this was true of only 6%e 11% of the individuals with acute coronary syndrome, suggesting that targeting the testing to patients with respiratory infection symptoms or respiratory co-morbidities would probably be more beneficial.",
