In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.",

Dipyridamole is another anti-coagulation drug. In a pilot trial, dipyridamole administration promoted mucosal healing and improved clinical symptoms in patients with colitis or IBD [13]. More importantly, published clinical studies [15-20], including those conducted in China (DOI: CNKI:SUN:XIYI.0.2010-12-026;[21]; CNKI:SUN:YXLT.0.2014-32-031), have demonstrated that dipyridamole has broad spectrum antiviral activity against virus infections.
