This motif is palmitoylated in the Betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV. Here, we demonstrate by metabolic labeling with [ 3 H]-palmitic acid that the S protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus, is palmitoylated as well. This is relevant for TGEV replication as virus growth was compromised by the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate. Mutation of individual cysteine clusters in the cysteine-rich motif of S revealed that all cysteines must be replaced to abolish acylation and incorporation of S into virus-like particles (VLP). Conversely, the interaction of S with the M protein, essential for VLP incorporation of S, was not impaired by lack of palmitoylation. Thus, palmitoylation of the S protein of Alphacoronaviruses is dispensable for S-M interaction, but required for the generation of progeny virions.",

The genus Betacoronavirus comprises the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as well as the recently emerged human pathogens severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. The genus Alphacoronavirus includes important animal pathogens like feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is the subject of this study. The positive-stranded RNA genome of coronaviruses is associated with the N protein, building up the nucleocapsid, which is surrounded by a lipid bilayer.

This paper focuses on the S protein of TGEV. This is a large type 1 membrane protein (250 kDa) that is responsible for the attachment to the cellular receptor and subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The S protein is incorporated into virus particles by interaction with the M protein (Nguyen and Hogue, 1997; Vennema et al., 1996) . This is an indispensable step in the CoV replication cycle to obtain infectious virus particles.",

The CoV S proteins share little sequence homology at this region but the cysteine content is about 35%. For the Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MHV, it has been shown that the S proteins are palmitoylated at the CRM (Petit et al., 2007; Thorp et al., 2006) . In both viruses the palmitoylation of the S protein is implicitly necessary for the incorporation of the S protein into virus-like particles (VLPs) or virus particles (Thorp et al., 2006; Ujike et al., 2012) . However, a partial CRM can be sufficient for the incorporation of the S protein (Ujike et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012) . In contrast to that, the interaction of the S and M proteins has different requirements in both viruses. Treatment with the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate disrupted the interaction of S and M proteins in MHV (Thorp et al., 2006) . Conversely, the SARS-CoV S-M protein interaction is not impaired with a palmitoylation-null S protein cysteine-mutant (McBride and Machamer, 2010) .",

In our study we addressed the role of the S protein CRM of the Alphacoronavirus TGEV during assembly. To this end, we substituted cysteines in the CRM of the TGEV S protein and assessed their effect on VLP formation and on S-M protein interaction. We show that in contrast to the SARS-CoV S protein the TGEV S protein is incorporated into VLPs irrespective of the position of its palmitoylated cysteines. For an efficient interaction between TGEV S and M proteins, palmitoylation of the S protein is not necessary. Our results demonstrate that despite general similarities, coronaviruses show differences regarding the functional role of S protein palmitoylation that may have been induced by evolutionary forces.",

            "text": "The palmitate analog 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) inhibits protein palmitoylation in general (Webb et al., 2000) . To investigate whether palmitoylation has an impact on TGEV infectivity, we performed a treatment with 2-BP ( Fig. 2A) . ST cells were infected with TGEV and treated with different concentrations of 2- BP (0, 0.8, 4, 8, and 12 mM) . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, grown in BHK-21 cells) was employed as a control since the assembly of this virus does not depend on palmitoylation (Thorp et al., 2006; Whitt and Rose, 1991) . These 2-BP concentrations were not cytotoxic for ST cells verified with a WST-1 cell proliferation assay (Fig. 2B) . About 24 h after infection, media were harvested and viral infectivity was determined by plaque assay. The production of infectious VSV particles was not significantly inhibited by the 2-BP treatment ( Fig. 2A ) (Thorp et al., 2006; Whitt and Rose, 1991) . In contrast to that, a significant, dose-dependent decrease of TGEV infectivity was observed upon 2-BP treatment. This decrease in infectivity correlated with a decrease in the amount of virus particles in the supernatant of 2-BP-treated, infected cells, as seen by Western blot of pelleted supernatants for viral proteins (Fig. 2C ). The amount of protein expression in the cell lysates was not influenced by 2-BP treatment (Fig. 2C ). From these results, we conclude that an inhibition of palmitoylation has negative effects on the production of infectious TGEV (but not VSV) particles. While we cannot exclude that the reduction in infectious TGEV particle numbers upon 2-BP treatment is partially caused by inhibited palmitoylation of an essential cellular factor, we considered it most likely that the palmitoylation of a viral protein is required for the production of infectious virions. This led us to assess whether the TGEV S protein is palmitoylated.",

The cysteine-rich motif (CRM) is highly conserved among CoV S proteins, and a CRM is also found in the S protein of TGEV as a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus (Fig. 1) . To determine whether the TGEV S protein is also palmitoylated, TGEV was grown in ST cells in the presence of [ 3 H]-palmitic acid to achieve radioactive labeling, followed by pelleting of the virus, SDS-PAGE and fluorography. This revealed that the S protein of TGEV is indeed S-acylated, visible by the band at about 250 kDa which was absent in uninfected cells (Fig. 2D ). The specificity of this labeling with [ 3 H]-palmitic acid was confirmed by hydroxylamine treatment (Fig. 2D ). Hydroxylamine cleaves thioester linkages at neutral pH and thus any palmitic acid linked to a cysteine residue by S-acylation. The disappearance of the TGEV S protein band after hydroxylamine treatment proves that this protein is S-acylated at at least one cysteine residue. ",

            "text": "As the infectivity of TGEV was reduced after 2-BP treatment and the S protein present in TGE virions was shown to be palmitoylated, we concentrated our analysis on the cysteine-rich motif (CRM) present in the cytoplasmic domain of the TGEV S protein (Fig. 1) . The Swt protein of the TGEV-PUR-MAD strain contains 10 cysteine residues within the CRM (Sanchez et al., 1990) . The CRM of TGEV S can be split up in three cysteine clusters with three to four cysteine residues (Fig. 1) . To test whether specific cysteine clusters have a crucial role during virus assembly, partial Cys-mutants were created in addition to the complete cysteine mutant where all cysteines were replaced by alanines (S_C 1-10 A, Fig. 3A ). As the transfection efficiency of ST cells is quite low, BHK-21 cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding for the different Cys-mutants. The labeling with [ 3 H]-palmitic acid showed that all partial mutants were palmitoylated whereas the complete Cys-mutant was not palmitoylated (Fig. 3B ). The presence of three cysteines in the CRM (S_C 1-7 A) was hence sufficient for the protein to be acylated even if the degree of palmitoylation was lower for this mutant (Fig. 3B ). It is conceivable that palmitoylation of the CRM cysteines is important for fusion, which is mediated by the S protein. The importance of the CRM of the MHV and SARS-CoV S proteins for fusion has already been proven (Bos et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2000;  McBride and Machamer, 2010; Shulla and Gallagher, 2009) . In this study, we however evaluated whether palmitoylation is important for assembly and incorporation of the spike protein into newly generated virus particles. To analyze this role a virus-like particle assay was performed in which the incorporation of S can be analyzed separately from the influence of the fusion capacity of the S protein. The incorporation of the TGEV S protein is an essential step during assembly to form infectious particles. To determine the importance of the TGEV S protein's CRM during virus assembly we analyzed the capability of the TGEV S Cys-mutants to be incorporated into virus-like particles (VLPs, Fig. 3D and E). The co-expression of the TGEV E and M proteins is the minimal requirement for VLP formation (Baudoux et al., 1998) . If the S protein is co-expressed with M and E it will be incorporated into VLPs (Vennema et al., 1996) . In contrast to the authentic TGEV S protein the complete Cys-mutant S_C 1-10 A was not incorporated into VLPs (Fig. 3D) . The analyzed partial Cysmutants S_C 1-3 A, S_C 4-7 A, S_C 8-10 A, and S_C 1-7 A behaved like the TGEV Swt protein and were incorporated into VLPs (Fig. 3D ). To confirm these results and to account for variations in protein levels in Western blots, we additionally performed immunofluorescence analysis to show the cell surface transport of S protein (Fig. 3E) . We obtained comparable intracellular expression levels of all tested TGEV S proteins and the TGEV M protein. Like in the VLP assay analyzed by Western blot, the S_C 1-10 A mutant was the only S protein which was not detectable on the cell surface and therefore not incorporated into VLPs (Fig. 3E) . These results demonstrate that cysteines are important for the S protein incorporation into viral particles, and that they are at least partially redundant. In contrast to the reports for SARS-CoV (Ujike et al., 2012) , the specific position of the cysteine residue inside the cysteine-rich region seems not to be relevant for the incorporation into VLPs. The presence of one cluster of 3 cysteines (S_C 1-7 A) is enough to incorporate S into VLPs.",

To exclude that the inability of the complete Cys-mutant to incorporate into VLPs is caused by a defect in oligomerization, we analyzed the quaternary structure of S_C 1-10 A with a sucrose density gradient and compared it with the TGEV Swt protein. The results showed that the wild type protein and the Cys-mutant are both detectable in high-concentration sucrose fractions indicating a comparable oligomerization potential (Fig. 3C ).

This conformation may play a minor role in the binding to the M protein but may be important for the incorporation of the TGEV S protein into virus-like particles.

A lot of viruses use palmitoylation to target their proteins to lipid microdomains at the plasma membrane for assembly (Bhattacharya et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2000) . Palmitoylated proteins concentrate with interacting proteins at intracellular microdomains as well. As examples, the chaperon Calnexin and the transmembrane thioredoxin protein are recruited to detergent-resistant membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum by palmitoylation (Hayashi and Fujimoto, 2010; Lynes et al., 2012) . Thus, a version of the TGEV S protein like the complete Cys-mutant S_C 1-10 A that lacks palmitic acids may interact with the M protein in an S-M protein co-expression experiment but may not be sorted to the membrane microdomains at the ERGIC in which virus assembly and budding take place and may therefore not be incorporated into newly generated virions or VLPs. McBride and Machamer have shown that the SARS-CoV S protein is present in DRMs at the plasma membrane in single expression experiments. For a complete Cys-mutant of the SARS-CoV S protein it was shown that it is no longer present in DRMs (McBride and Machamer, 2010) . These results confirm the hypothesis that the palmitoylation of coronavirus S proteins directs them to membrane microdomains and that this localization is indispensable for the incorporation into VLPs and virions.",

Thus, we aimed to find out whether the palmitoylation of S is required for the interaction with the M protein (as in the case of MHV; (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009; Thorp et al., 2006) ), or not (as for SARS-CoV; (McBride and Machamer, 2010; Ujike et al., 2012) ). To determine this, we expressed M (with HA-tag) together with the various cysteine mutants of S, with the background of a destroyed ERGIC retention signal (Y/A, Fig. 4A ). With this Y/A mutation, S is efficiently transported to the plasma membrane in the absence of M, but is retained intracellularly by M ( Fig. 4B and C) . Failure of S_Y/A cysteine mutants to interact with M thus leads to plasma membrane delivery of S even in the presence of M. The TGEV S variants depicted in Fig. 4A were expressed in BHK-21 cells by transfection, in the absence or presence of HA-tagged TGEV M. Immunofluorescence analysis was employed to assess the localization of S and M. All partial Cys-mutants and even the complete Cys-mutant showed a similar protein localization pattern with the M protein ( Fig. 4B and C) . This pattern was identical to the one seen for the S wildtype protein in coexpression with the HA-tagged M protein (S wt, Fig. 4B and C). In contrast to that, the VSV G protein was not retained and not intracellularly clustered by the co-expression of HA-tagged TGEV M protein (VSV G, Fig. 4B and C) . These results indicate that specific interactions between the TGEV S and M proteins lead to an intracellular retention of the mutant S proteins and that the interaction of TGEV S and M proteins is not dependent on the palmitoylation of S. Palmitoylation is known to affect protein trafficking (Greaves and Chamberlain, 2007; Resh, 1999 Resh, , 2006 . Our results show that this is not the case for the TGEV S since the full cysteine-mutant with Y/A-mutation traffics correctly to the cell surface in single expression (Fig. 4C ) and the full cysteine-mutant has a comparable oligomerization potential as the wildtype protein (Fig. 3C) .",

Our results for TGEV are similar to the published results for the SARS-CoV S protein, where the cysteine-rich motif is not important for the interaction between S and M proteins (McBride and Machamer, 2010) . For these coronaviral spike proteins other parts like the transmembrane domain or the ectodomain of S could play a role in the interaction with the M protein.",

            "text": "It is of significant interest to understand how the S protein is incorporated into coronavirus particles because the S protein mediates binding to the cellular receptor and fusion with the cellular membrane and is therefore indispensable for the generation of infectious virus particles. One important result from our study is that the palmitoylation of the cysteine-rich motif at the carboxy-terminus of the TGEV S protein is necessary for the incorporation of S into virus-like particles. Furthermore, our results suggest that the loss of palmitoylation does not affect the interaction with the TGEV M protein. Here, we show that for TGEV, the interaction of the S protein with M has different requirements than the incorporation of S into virus particles. This is the first study about the role of palmitoylation in virus assembly for the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, demonstrating that there are some similarities but also differences in the requirements for coronavirus assembly in MHV (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009; Thorp et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2012) , SARS-CoV (McBride and Machamer, 2010; Ujike et al., 2012) , and the Alphacoronavirus TGEV (Fig. 4D) .",

The same field is shown in each set of images for the coexpression of S and M. (C) Every TGEV S cysteine-mutant is retained intracellularly when co-expressed with the HA-tagged TGEV M protein. The S protein (or the VSV G protein) was detected on the cell surface of non-permeabilized BHK-21 cells expressing either the S proteins alone or in co-expression with the TGEV M. The detection of the HA-tagged TGEV M protein was done after permeabilization with Triton-X 100 prior to antibody incubation.
