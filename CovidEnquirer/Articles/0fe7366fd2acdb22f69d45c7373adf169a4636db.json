            "text": "Prior to the use of molecular detection methods to detect respiratory viruses, detection rates of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens from children with cystic fibrosis (CF) were remarkably low. 1 Viral detection in this patient population was complicated by multiple factors, including tenacious respiratory specimens that inhibited viral growth in cell culture, bacterial and fungal overgrowth contaminating respiratory specimens, and the general problems with cultivation of difficult-to-propagate respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, and other viral pathogens. The use of potentially insensitive serologic assays further hampered the detection of respiratory viral infections in this patient population. None-the-less, the association of respiratory viral infections with exacerbations of lung disease and overall progression of CF airway disease has been appreciated for a number of years. [1] [2] [3] [4] Molecular diagnostic techniques circumvent the problems associated with viral culture in children with CF and permit the detection of viruses that are extremely difficult or impossible to culture even in optimal settings. 2,5-7 Multiple viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have been clearly associated with pulmonary exacerbations and worsening lung function in children with CF. 2, 6, 8, 9 However, clinical symptoms associated with new respiratory viruses such as coronavirus and human metapneumovirus are not well described, and the symptomatic impact of rhinovirus, the most commonly detected virus in CF patients, 2, 6, 8, 9 is not We performed a 2-year prospective cohort study in school-age children with CF to compare respiratory virus detection in upper airway and sputum samples. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of respiratory viruses was performed on respiratory specimens collected during routine clinic visits and during pulmonary exacerbation. Paired upper airway and sputum samples were collected on a subset of participants within the larger cohort study, and the concordance of PCR-based viral detection between sample types was determined. The association between the detection of respiratory viruses and clinical symptoms was also evaluated.",

Among the 329 visits giving rise to these samples, 130 (39AE5%) visits were characterized by respiratory illness requiring antibiotic treatment (intravenous or inhaled antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbation or other antibiotic treatment for respiratory-related illness). Rhinovirus was detected in 35 of 130 respiratory illness visits (26AE9%) and in 43 of 199 non-illness visits (21AE6%).

When respiratory illnesses requiring antibiotic treatment up to 30 days prior to the study visit were included, the association with the detection of rhinovirus was slightly stronger (OR 1AE6; 95% CI 0AE95, 2AE7; P = 0AE07).

This differs from the findings of Wat et al. 16 in the UK who detected rhinoviruses in 7AE4% of samples obtained during routine clinic visits and in 15AE9% of those obtained during an exacerbation (P = 0AE0027), suggesting an association between rhinovirus and pulmonary exacerbations. These discrepant results may reflect our study design, with a smaller study population (44 versus 71 participants) and relatively less frequent sampling (quarterly versus every 2 months). In addition, the UK study included children between the ages 0 and 18, whereas our study excluded patients under 6 years of age. It might be expected that rhinoviruses were more commonly associated with pulmonary exacerbations when younger children were included. Studies in hospitalized children under five who do not have CF have demonstrated rates of rhinovirusassociated hospitalization of 4AE8 per 1000 children, with much higher rates in those with a history of wheezing or asthma (25AE3 hospitalizations pre-1000 children). 18 The detection of rhinoviruses in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects raises the possibility of prolonged viral shedding in children with CF. Prolonged shedding in children with asthma, for example, has been previously reported in several studies. 23 However, because we only followed patients at routine quarterly clinical visits and because our techniques did not type the rhinoviruses, we cannot definitively document prolonged shedding versus multiple reinfections with single or different rhinovirus subtypes.",

Sputum samples were used to assess viral shedding in the lower airway, as the use of an invasive procedure such as bronchoalveolar lavage could not be justified in our study. The question of contamination of sputum samples by respiratory viruses in the upper airway is another potential concern. However, the distribution of our concordant and discordant samples argues against this. Finally, the frequency of sampling (that was chosen to reflect current clinical practice guidelines) was not sufficiently frequent to detect viral infections early in their course.",

Recent studies demonstrating the important short-term and long-term impacts of rhinovirus in children with and without underlying lung disease emphasize the impact of this virus 18 and suggest a need to reexamine its impact in children and young adults with CF.",
