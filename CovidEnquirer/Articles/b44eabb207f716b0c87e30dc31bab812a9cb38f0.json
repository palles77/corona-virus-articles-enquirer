Natural breeding stations exist in Egypt and Bulgaria. Bulls in the breeding stations are provided by development programs of the government or other agencies. Due to difficulties in estrus detection and lack of organization, artificial insemination (AI) is still practiced only to a very limited extent for buffaloes in the Mediterranean region: in Italy for 2.5% of the buffaloes, in Egypt and Iran for 0.5% and in Romania for 0.1%. In the large cooperative and state farms in Bulgaria, AI is used on 80% of the buffaloes. In the other countries it is not used at all. The low use of AI has slowed down the implementation of national selection schemes for genetic improvement of milk productivity. Research trials conducted in Italy have indicated that artificial insemination is feasible and successful in buffaloes using the following technique to synchronize estrus and boost fertility. A progesterone-releasing intravaginal device (PRID) of silicon coils is inserted and left for 10 days; on the seventh day injections of 1000 IU of eCG (equine chorionic gonadotropin) and 15 mg of luprostiol (prostaglandin F 2a ) are given; artificial insemination is performed at 48, 72 and 96 h after removal of the PRID on day 10.",

One-third of Iraqi buffaloes wallow in marshes all year, the water reaching a level halfway up their bodies. They swim far and wide to find food and when the water is high, they stand on platforms made of papyrus, reeds and mud; on these platforms the farmers sometimes build huts to house the buffaloes; these platforms can be pushed to different places in the marshes.",
