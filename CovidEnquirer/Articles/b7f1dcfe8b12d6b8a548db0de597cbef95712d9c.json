            "text": "The virologic test results of 415 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were examined. The peak detection rate for SARS-associated coronavirus occurred at week 2 after illness onset for respiratory specimens, at weeks 2 to 3 for stool or rectal swab specimens, and at week 4 for urine specimens. The latest stool sample that was positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was collected on day 75 while the patient was receiving intensive care. Tracheal aspirate and stool samples had a higher diagnostic yield (RT-PCR average positive rate for first 2 weeks: 66.7% and 56.5%, respectively). Pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens provided a moderate yield (29.7%-40.0%), whereas throat washing and urine specimens showed a lower yield (17.3% and 4.5%). The collection procedures for stool and pooled nasal and throat swab specimens were the least likely to transmit infection, and the combination gave the highest yield for coronavirus detection by RT-PCR. Positive virologic test results in patient groups were associated with mechanical ventilation or death (p < 0.001), suggesting a correlation between viral load and disease severity.",

In Hong Kong, the first recognized outbreak of SARS occurred in early March 2003 in the Prince of Wales Hospital (6, 7) . Subsequently, outbreaks were reported from other hospitals and from the community (8) . As of September 26, 2003, 8,098 cases had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 29 cities, 1,755 of which were found in Hong Kong (9) . No new cases have been found in Hong Kong since June 11, 2003 , and on June 23, 2003, WHO removed Hong Kong from the list of areas with local transmission (10). Since identification of the culprit virus in late March 2003, a network has been set up in Hong Kong to provide centralized laboratory diagnostic services for patients with suspected cases of SARS. The diagnostic approach was based on a combination of serologic testing, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus isolation. Here, we report our experience with the laboratory diagnosis for SARS-CoV infection during this outbreak in Hong Kong, with emphases on the viral shedding pattern, the diagnostic yield of various specimen types, and detection methods.",

Detection of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody was based on an in-house immunofluorescence assay that used virusinfected cells. Of the 433 patients with positive serologic test results, 18 were excluded because no samples had been collected for virus detection. As a result, 415 patients were included in this study. Twelve were pediatric patients 3-16 years of age (mean 11.3, standard deviation [SD] 4.1), divided equally between girls and boys. Three hundred thirty-five were adult patients 17-64 years of age (mean 37.1, SD 11.2), with 60.9% females. The remaining 68 were elderly patients 65-97 years of age (mean 76.7, SD 8.2), with 37 (54.4%) women. Altogether, 48/335 (14.3%) of the adult group and 2/68 (2.9%), respectively, of the elderly group required ventilation and received intensive care but recovered; 4/335 (1.2%) of adults and 21/68 (30.9%) of elderly patients died of the infection. All children recovered without requiring mechanical ventilation or intensive care. transported in sterile containers. For some patients, throat and nasal swab samples were pooled into a single specimen container and processed as a single specimen. These samples were referred as \"pooled throat and nasal swabs\" for the purpose of analysis in this study. Specimens collected were refrigerated (approximately 10\u00b0C) until delivery, which were done on the same day in most circumstances.

All possible resources were deployed to provide a rapid diagnostic service for SARS patients, and a turnaround time of 24 to 48 hours was achieved for RT-PCR. From our experience, more than half of the patients did not have any positive virologic findings.

The ability to detect virus in stool specimens peaked at the beginning of the second week and remained high over week 3 and week 4. Occasionally, the shedding of virus in stool could last for more than 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The viral shedding peak in urine occurred even later, at weeks 3-4.",

            "text": "In summary, viral shedding of SARS-CoV peaks at a time later than expected and occurs when patients are being hospitalized. This, together with the prolonged viral shedding, could partly explain the propensity for this infection to be transmitted in healthcare settings. We observed that all those who shed virus for a prolonged period (arbitrarily defined as the shedding viruses >6 weeks after onset of symptoms) had their positive samples collected while still critically ill and had received intensive care. The infectiousness of these patients is difficult to discuss because the virus was detected by RT-PCR but not by virus isolation. Nevertheless, further investigations on whether the adverse outcome could be related to inadequate viral clearance are worth pursuing. Available data that compare the diagnostic yield of various specimen types are still limited. Wu et al. found that virus was detected in 73% (49/67) of liquid nasopharyngeal gargling samples by a fluorescent PCR (16) . However, our data showed that throat washing samples were the most inferior respiratory specimens. In addition to the difference in the sensitivity of detection assays used, the procedures of gargle sample collection could have affected the diagnostic yield. Yam et al. reported that nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected between days 1 and 5 after admission provided a similar diagnostic yield when compared to stool samples collected between days 5 and 10 (17). However, data comparing respiratory and stool specimens collected at the same period were not available in their study. In an investigation on a community outbreak in Hong Kong, Peiris et al. reported that respiratory viral shedding peaked during the second week (15) . A high positive rate was also obtained from stool samples collected during the second week, but the yield for first week stool samples was not available for comparison.",

However, for SARS, the great risk of generating infectious aerosols during the aspiration procedure needs to be considered. We found that pooled throat and nasal swab specimens provided a higher diagnostic yield compared with nasopharyngeal aspirates. Our data indicate that a combination of stool sample and pooled throat and nasal swab specimens should be the specimens of choice for a safe and high-yield SARS-CoV detection. In situations where specimen load is high, pooling of stool sample with throat and nasal swabs for RT-PCR can be considered to minimize the reagent and personnel costs.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV was first isolated from a monkey kidney cell line and is known to produce characteristic cytopathic effects after a few days of incubation in Vero or Vero E6 cell monolayers. At present, the ideal in vitro growth conditions have not yet been elucidated. Our data on isolation/RT-PCR index showed that about 10%-50% of the RT-PCR-positive respiratory and urine specimens had virus grown from Vero E6 cell culture. However, stool and rectal swab specimens had a much lower isolation/RT-PCR index. The presence of toxic substances in stool or rectal swab samples may have interfered with virus isolation. However, toxicity was only occasionally observed on Vero E6 monolayers after adding stool or rectal swab samples. SARS-CoV can survive for at least 2-4 days at room temperature when mixed with diarrheal or normal stool specimens (18) . Thus, the poor isolation rate could not be a result of viral inactivation by fecal contents during specimen storage and transport. The big difference in isolation rate from stool compared to respiratory and urine samples deserve further investigation, and the possibility of viral growth interference due the presence of IgA antibodies needs to be considered. We found that positive virologic results were associated with more adverse outcomes in patients. This observation could be confounded by the fact that only high-yield specimens, e.g., tracheal aspirate, could be obtained from intubated patients. We verified this point by examining the results of testing other samples from patients with viruses detected from tracheal aspirate samples. We found that all except one of these patients also had viruses detected from other specimen types. Thus, our observations are in line with the fact that more severely affected patients shed a higher load of virus, which facilitated the detection of the virus.",

First, detection of viremia should be included in the diagnostic algorithm because we have found SARS-CoV RNA from blood samples taken within the first few days of onset of symptoms. If this approach is successful, it will close the gap caused by lower virus shedding from the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract that occurs in the first few days after the onset of symptoms. Second, a SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal antibody would be valuable in developing an immunofluorescence assay to detect virus-infected cells from respiratory samples. Such an approach has been shown to provide high sensitivity for influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Third, an assay should be developed to detect viral antigens from stool samples as is available for rotavirus detection. Further work to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV is needed. The unusual shedding pattern of SARS-CoV should be considered when formulating infection control strategies. ",
