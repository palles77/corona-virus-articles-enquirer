Although the physiological function of LRG is not known, increases in the serum level of LRG have been reported in various diseases. In this study, we found that LRG was induced by recombinant human IL-6 in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The induction of LRG by IL-6 was up-regulated synergistically with either IL-1b or TNFa in a pattern similar to those for type 1 acute-phase proteins. We also found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administered intraperitoneally to mice enhanced dose-dependently the expression of LRG mRNA in the liver as well as those for mouse major acute-phase proteins. These results strongly suggest that LRG was a secretory type 1 acute-phase protein whose expression was up-regulated by the mediator of acute-phase response.",

Major APPs, which increased at least 1000-fold higher than normal levels, include serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and either C-reactive protein (CRP) in human or its homolog in mice, serum amyloid P component (SAP). APPs are considered to be non-specific innate immune components involved in the restoration of homeostasis and the restraint of microbial growth before the activation of acquired immunity. The concentrations of circulating APPs, such as CRP and SAA, are related to the severity of the disorder and the extent of tissue damage and thus provide the diagnostic and prognostic information.",

LRG consists of 312 amino acid residues, 66 of which are leucines. This protein contains 8 repeating consensus sequences, each of which consists of 24 amino acid residues and exhibits a periodic pattern in the occurrence of leucine, proline, and asparagines. This consensus sequence, termed leucine-rich repeat (LRR), has since been identified as an LRR-containing domain, now appeared in over 55,000 sequences in PFAM database [4] . Most LRRs are 20-30 amino acids long and the repeat number ranges from 2 to 52. The primary function of LRRs appears to be to provide a versatile structural framework of the formation of protein-protein interactions [5] . Although many LRR proteins have been found to function in the plant immune response and the mammalian innate immune response, the physiological function of LRG is still unknown.",

This finding has led to the hypothesis that human LRG might be a human homolog of the PLIb and function as a PLA 2 inhibitory protein. To test this possibility, mouse LRG was purified from the sera by sequential chromatography on Sephadex G-200, Q-Sepharose, Phenyl Sepharose, and Mono Q columns, but this isolated mouse LRG did not show any PLA 2 inhibitory activities (Shirai et al., unpublished results).",

Recently, with the development of proteomic analysis with 2-D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, it has also been revealed that the expression of LRG increased in various diseases. In inflammation of the small intestine of cystic fibrosis mouse, the amount of LRG increased about 21-fold greater than that for normal mouse, and this up-regulation was associated with an increased number of neutrophils in the intestine [8] . In the sera of patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), lung cancer, and pancreas cancer, the amount of LRG increased 3.5-fold, 6-fold, and 3-fold, respectively [9] [10] [11] [12] .

As shown in Fig. 1B and C, the amounts of LRG mRNA increased slightly and gradually at 12-24 h after the stimulation with the IL-1b and TNFa, respectively. On the contrary, the amounts of LRG mRNA abruptly increased 5-fold at 2 h after the stimulation with IL-6, reached its maximum at 6 h, and markedly decreased less than the basal level at 24 h (Fig. 1D) . IL-1b and TNFa had synergistic actions on the expression of LRG mRNA induced by IL-6 ( Fig. 1E and F, respectively). The amount of LRG mRNA induced by using a combination of IL-6 and IL-1b, and that for a combination of IL-6 and TNFa were 2 and 1.5-fold greater, respectively, than that induced by IL-6 alone. Furthermore, a marked decrease in the expression of LRG mRNA, found at 24 h after the stimulation with IL-6, was attenuated by coexisting IL-1b or TNFa. IL-6 was known to be the major regulator of APP synthesis in human hepatocytes [1, 14] . These results show that the LRG expression in HepG2 cells is up-regulated by IL-6, and IL-6 acts synergistically with coexisting IL-1b or TNFa.",

LRG expression was examined in mouse liver at 6 h after intraperitoneal injections of various concentrations of LPS. As shown in Fig. 3 , LPS was found to induce a dose-dependent enhancement of the expression of LRG mRNA as well as those for the mRNAs of major APPs in mouse, SAA and SAP. The expression of LRG mRNA was most strongly correlated with the dose of LPS (r = 0.51, P = 0.006) in comparison with those of the mRNAs of SAA (r = 0.47, P = 0.012) and SAP (r = 0.35, P = 0.071). The expression of LRG mRNA was highly correlated with that of SAA mRNA (r = 0.60, P = 0.0007). Although we could not quantify the LRG concentrations in the sera of LPS-treated mice in the present study, it is reasonable to conclude that the dose-dependent increase in the level of hepatic LRG mRNA results in the dose-dependent increase in the serum level of LRG protein.",

However, the purified mouse LRG did not show any PLA 2 inhibitory activities (Shirai et al., unpublished re- sults). Since PLIb from the venomous snake sera binds specifically basic PLA 2 included in its own venom and inhibit its enzymatic activity, it was suggested that PLIb directly participate in the clearance of venom PLA 2 for self-protection against its own venom.
