The current use of vaccines and issues surrounding their use are discussed, including motivations for and against vaccinating in a climate of reduced fear of disease, and increased suspicion of vaccines. Attitudes to extended DOI and routine booster vaccinations are explored, and specific disease and prevention issues concerning leptospirosis in particular are presented. The strategy and tactics of implementation of extended DOI vaccines at general practice level are discussed based on the author's own experiences, and thoughts offered on how vaccine manufacturers might support the process at local and national levels, as well as communicating a positive message for continued routine vaccination of dogs and cats, and the advantages that extended DOI offers. #",

Intervet has led the way with their Nobivac 1 canine vaccines, extending the requirement for distemper, hepatitis and parvovirus booster vaccination from once yearly to one every 3 years. However, annual leptospirosis and parainfluenza virus booster vaccination is still necessary. Intervet's intranasal www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 117 (2006) [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] kennel cough vaccine (Nobivac KC) also now has an extended DOI from 3 months to 1 year. Other manufacturers have started to introduce extended DOI canine vaccines too, including the 'Procyon' dog vaccine range from Schering Plough and more recently the 'Vanguard' canine vaccines from Pfizer Animal Health. Extended DOI vaccines for cats are less common, although e.g., Merial Animal Health markets a 2-year DOI vaccine for feline panleucopenia (Eurifel P). However, once yearly ''cat flu'' vaccination: (feline rhinotracheitis [herpesvirus] and feline calicivirus) is still the normal protocol.",

            "text": "Other established vaccines have traditionally been authorised for annual booster vaccination, and although this has been the accepted protocol for many years of successful disease prevention with few associated problems, more recently questions have arisen which challenge this regime. Veterinary Practices in the UK generally follow the manufacturers' Data Sheet recommendations for booster intervals. Some veterinary surgeons, however, have tried to incorporate extended DOI protocols into canine vaccination regimes as extended DOI has become an issue; very often (in the author's experience) as a response to client demand (e.g. giving a canine primary vaccination course with no boosters-not even leptospirosis; giving a primary course followed by a few boosters in younger years only; giving a primary course followed by just annual leptospirosis boosters). In this respect, the problem that practitioners face is that recommending any vaccine or medicine usage ''off data sheet'' carries an increasing risk in modern litigious times. Vaccine manufactures can only reasonably be expected to support the use of their vaccines according to their authorised recommendations (as detailed on the official Summary of Product Characteristics and UK Data Sheet). Fortunately the recent development and availability of extended DOI vaccines will help address many of the concerns being raised regarding ''over-vaccination''.",

Core feline vaccines include those against ''cat flu'' (feline rhinotracheitis [herpes virus] and feline calicivirus) and feline panleucopenia; whereas ''non-core'' include those against feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and rabies.",

Latterly, however, many issues have arisen, especially related to routine canine vaccination. One major factor is the falling prevalence of the once-common, lifethreatening diseases such as distemper, hepatitis and parvovirosis. Paradoxically, this is due to the success of modern vaccines, but with the ''out of sight; out of mind'' philosophy resulting in falling awareness and concern about disease, has come an increased awareness and even fear of the vaccines themselves amongst a percentage of owners. This has been fuelled by several factors, which will be discussed later. Leptospirosis in dogs, especially L. icterohaemorrhagiae, remains a notable disease threat.",

This is in part due to the persistence of these viruses in their host, enabling spread from stressed lactating queens to their kittens before they can be practically vaccinated, but possibly also due to issues of cross protection (or lack of) between vaccinal strains (e.g. F9 calicivirus) and field strains of ever changing virulence. More work is required to develop vaccines with broader efficacy, and FCV vaccines may need to be multivalent in future. Feline panleucopenia vaccines have been much more effective, and offer clearer potential for extended DOI claims. FeLV vaccines have also been successful but are unlikely to lend themselves to extended DOI claims. There are no vaccines currently available in the UK for other common and serious feline diseases caused by viruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline coronavirus (causing the FIP complex), and these diseases remain a problem in practice.",

These include habit and routine, often prompted by practice policy and use of reminder systems (the owners continuing to do what they have always done). Fear of disease and a wish to prevent it are strong drivers when disease is widely prevalent and ''visible''. There are some situations where vaccination is 'mandatory', e.g. kennel and cattery stipulations that animals be vaccinated against core canine and feline diseases, and often also against ''non core'' diseases such as kennel cough. Such requirements may be part of the kennel's local authority license to operate, and are, therefore, compulsory for any animal staying. Another mandatory requirement for vaccination is that for rabies as part of the Pet Passport scheme, which is becoming more popular as owners wish to travel abroad with their pets. The author's own practice has seen a 50% increase in use of rabies vaccines as a result of this in the last 12 months.",

This has been combined with a rising fear of harm associated with vaccination, fuelled by issues involving human vaccines (e.g. child vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] which has purportedly been linked to problems such as autism), and a heightened awareness of supposed pet vaccine reactions. The Canine Health Concern group has been partly responsible for driving these concerns, despite the fact that reported adverse events in dogs and cats are a consistently low percentage of vaccines given (e.g. 0.21-0.61 reports per 10,000 doses) (The Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) report of the Working Group on Feline and Canine Vaccination 2002).

This concern has partly arisen from opinion in academia, especially in the USA, but has been fuelled by negative media attention, and availability of all kinds of unreviewed opinion on the internet. Extended DOI vaccines could go a long way to allay some of these fears, provided their benefits are adequately communicated. There is also a perceived mood of mistrust in some owners. This mistrust is of medicines, vaccines, doctors and veterinary surgeons, who are accused of using routine vaccination solely as a means to make money. The issue of cost and value is ever-present in veterinary practice, and one that needs tackling with energy to ensure that clients feel they have paid for a good service at booster time, and not just a ''quick jab''.",

This has led to startling headlines such as ''vet jabs kill our pets''; ''booster jabs unnecessary''; ''waste of money'' etc. Headlines such as these are bound to cause owners to question vaccines and vaccination policy, and the risk is that such sensationalism will seriously undermine the clear benefits that vaccines have quietly achieved over the last 30-40 years. Anyone who has seen life-threatening diseases such as distemper and parvovirus, and their potential to spread, will understand the obvious benefits of vaccination. A re-emergence of these diseases and their serious consequences is likely if the level of vaccine-induced immunity in the UK canine population falls too low. There is also an associated human health risk from diseases such as leptospirosis (also known as Weil's disease) caught from unvaccinated dogs that may be showing no clinical signs themselves.",

(iii) Extended DOI vaccines offer a positive advantage and will help allay fears of over-vaccination if the message can be communicated effectively. (iv) Leptospirosis in dogs (and man) must not be underestimated and still requires yearly vaccination, enabling regular health checks to continue. (v) The advantages of routine vaccination and benefits of extended DOI must be communicated properly to pet owners to counter irrational fears of the very vaccines that have so effectively reduced incidence of serious disease in dogs and cats over the years.",
