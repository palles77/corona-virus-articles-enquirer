            "text": "Networks inference problems are commonly found in multiple biomedical subfields such as genomics, metagenomics, neuroscience, and epidemiology. Networks are useful for representing a wide range of complex interactions ranging from those between molecular biomarkers, neurons, and microbial communities, to those found in human or animal populations. Recent technological advances have resulted in an increasing amount of healthcare data in multiple modalities, increasing the preponderance of network inference problems. Multi-domain data can now be used to improve the robustness and reliability of recovered networks from unimodal data. For infectious diseases in particular, there is a body of knowledge that has been focused on combining multiple pieces of linked information. Combining or analyzing disparate modalities in concert has demonstrated greater insight into disease transmission than could be obtained from any single modality in isolation. This has been particularly helpful in understanding incidence and transmission at early stages of infections that have pandemic potential. Novel pieces of linked information in the form of spatial, temporal, and other covariates including high-throughput sequence data, clinical visits, social network information, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and clinical symptoms (reported as free-text data) also encourage further investigation of these methods. The purpose of this review is to provide an in-depth analysis of multimodal infectious disease transmission network inference methods with a specific focus on Bayesian inference. We focus on analytical Bayesian inferencebased methods as this enables recovering multiple parameters simultaneously, for example, not just the disease transmission network, but also parameters of epidemic dynamics. Our review studies their assumptions, key inference parameters and limitations, and ultimately provides insights about improving future network inference methods in multiple applications.",

            "text": "Dynamical systems and their interactions are common across many areas of systems biology, neuroscience, healthcare, and medicine. Identifying these interactions is important because they can broaden our understanding of problems ranging from regulatory interactions in biomarkers, to functional connectivity in neurons, to how infectious agents transmit and cause disease in large populations. Several methods have been developed to reverse engineer or, identify cause and effect pathways of target variables in these interaction networks from observational data [1] [2] [3] . In genomics, regulatory interactions such as disease phenotype-genotype pairs can be identified by network reverse engineering [1, 4] . Molecular biomarkers or key drivers identified can then be used as targets for therapeutic drugs and directly benefit patient outcomes. In microbiome studies, network inference is utilized to uncover associations amongst microbes and between microbes and ecosystems or hosts [2, 5, 6] . This can include insights about taxa associations, phylogeny, and evolution of ecosystems. In neuroscience, there is an effort towards recovering brain-connectivity networks from functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and calcium fluorescence time series data [3, 7] . Identifying structural or functional neuronal pairs illuminates understanding of the structure of the brain, can help better understand animal and human intelligence, and inform treatment of neuronal diseases. Infectious disease transmission networks are widely studied in public health. Understanding disease transmission in large populations is an important modeling challenge because a better understanding of transmission can help predict who will be affected, and where or when they will be. Network interactions can be further refined by considering multiple circulating pathogenic strains in a population along with strain-specific interventions, such as during influenza and cold seasons. Thus, network interactions can be used to inform interventional measures in the form of antiviral drugs, vaccinations, quarantine, prophylactic drugs, and workplace or school closings to contain infections in affected areas [8] [9] [10] [11] . Developing robust network inference methods to accurately and coherently map interactions is, therefore, fundamentally important and useful for several biomedical fields.",

            "text": "As summarized in Fig. 1 , many methods have been used to identify pairwise interactions in genomics, neuroscience [12, 13] and microbiome research [14] including correlation and information gain-based metrics for association, inverse covariance for conditional independence testing, and Granger causality for causation from temporal data. Further, multimodal data integration methods such as horizontal integration, model-based integration, kernelbased integration, and non-negative matrix factorization have been used to combine information from multiple modalities of 'omics' data such as gene expression, protein expression, somatic mutations, and DNA methylation with demographic, diagnoses, and phenotypical clinical data. Bayesian inference has been used to analyze changes in gene expression from microarray data as DNA measurements can have several unmeasured confounders and thereby incorporate noise and uncertainty [15] . Multi-modal integration can be used for classification tasks, to predict clinical phenotypes such as tumor stage or lymph node status, for clustering of patients into subgroups, and to identify important regulatory modules [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In neuroscience, not just data integration, but multimodal data fusion has been performed by various methods such as linear regression, structural equation modeling, independent component analysis, principal component analysis, and partial least squares [21] . Multiple modalities such as FMRI, electroencephalography, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been jointly analyzed to uncover more details than could be captured by a single imaging technique [21] . In metagenomics, network inference from microbial data has been performed using methods such as inverse covariance and correlation [2] . In evolutionary biology, the massive generation of molecular data has enabled Bayesian inference of phylogenetic trees using Markov Chain Monte Carlo chain (MCMC) techniques [22, 23] . In infectious disease transmission network inference, Bayesian inference frameworks have been primarily used to integrate data such as dates of pathogen sample collection and symptom report date, pathogen genome sequences, and locations of patients [24] [25] [26] . This problem remains challenging as the data generative processes and scales of heterogeneous modalities may be widely different, transformations applied to separate modalities may not preserve the interactions between modalities, and separately integrated models may not capture interaction effects between modalities [27] .",

            "text": "As evidence mounts regarding the complex combination of biological, environmental, and social factors behind disease, emphasis on the development of advanced modeling and inference methods that incorporate multimodal data into singular frameworks has increased. These methods are becoming more important to consider given that the types of healthcare data available for understanding disease pathology, evolution, and transmission are numerous and growing. For example, Internet and mobile connectivity has enabled mobile sensors, point-of-care diagnostics, web logs, and participatory social media data which can provide complementary health information to traditional sources [28, 29] . In the era of precision medicine, it becomes especially important to combine clinical information with biomarker and environmental information to recover complex genotype-phenotype maps [30] [31] [32] [33] . Infectious disease networks are one area where the need to bring together data types has long been recognized, specifically to better understand disease transmission. Data sources including high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled genomic data to become more cost effective, offering support for studying transmission by revealing pathways of pathogen introduction and evolution in a population. Yet, genomic data in isolation is insufficient to obtain a comprehensive picture of disease in the population. While these data can provide information about pathogen evolution, genetic diversity, and molecular interaction, they do not capture other environmental, spatial, and clinical factors that can affect transmission. For infectious disease surveillance, this information is usually conveyed through epidemiological data, which can be collected in various ways such as in clinical settings from the medical record, or in more recent efforts through Web search logs, or participatory surveillance. Participatory surveillance data types typically include age, sex, date of symptom onset, and diagnostic information such as severity of symptoms. In clinical settings, epidemiological data are generally collected from patients reporting illness. This can include, for example, age at diagnosis, sex, race, family history, diagnostic information such as severity of symptoms, and phenotypical information such as presence or absence of disease which may not be standardized. Highthroughput sequencing of pathogen genomes, along with linked spatial and temporal information, can advance surveillance by increasing granularity and leading to a better understanding of the spread of an infectious disease [37] . Considerable efforts have been made to unify genomic and epidemiologic information from traditional clinical forms into singular statistical frameworks to refine understanding of disease transmission [24] [25] [26] [34] [35] [36] .",

A summary of data types, relevant questions and purpose of such studies is summarized in Fig. 2 , and we further articulate the approaches below. In molecular epidemiology, several approaches have been used to overlay pathogen genomic information on traditionally collected epidemiologic information to recover transmission networks. Additional modeling structure is needed in these problems because infectious disease transmission occurs through contact networks of heterogeneous individuals, which may not be captured by compartmental models such as Susceptible-Infec tious-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Latent-Infectious-Recov ered (SLIR) models [42] . As well, for increased utility in epidemiology, there is a necessity to estimate epidemic parameters in addition to the transmission network. Unlike other fields wherein recovery of just the topology of the networks is desired, in molecular epidemiology Bayesian inference is commonly used to reverse engineer infectious disease transmission networks in addition to estimating epidemic parameters (Fig. 2 ).",

Modeling network diffusion and influence, identifying important nodes, link prediction, influence probabilities and community topology and parameter detection are key questions in several fields ranging from genomics to social network analysis [43] . Analogous frameworks can be developed with different modalities of observational genomics or clinical data to model information propagation and capture the influences of nodes, nodes that are more influential than others, and the temporal dynamics of information diffusion. For modeling information spread in such networks, influence and susceptibility of nodes can serve to be analogous to epidemic transmission parameters. However, these modified methods should also account for differences in the method of information propagation in such networks from infectious disease transmission by incorporating constraints in the form of temporal decay of infection, strengths of ties measured from biological domain knowledge, and multiple pathways of information spread.",

For practicality and relevance, our search, summarized in Fig. 3 , was limited to papers from the last ten years. As our review is focused on infectious disease transmission network inference, we started with the keywords 'transmission' and 'epidemiological'. To ensure that we captured studies that incorporate pathogen genomic data, we added the keywords 'genetic', 'genomic' and 'phylogenetic' giving 5557 articles total. Next, to narrow the results to those that are comprised of a study of multi-modal data, we found that the keywords 'combining' or 'integrating' alongside 'Bayesian inference' or 'inference' were comprehensive. These filters yielded 73 and 61 articles in total. We found that some resulting articles focused on outbreak detection, sexually transmitted diseases, laboratory methods, and phylogenetic analysis. Also, the focus of several articles was to either overlay information from different modalities or to sequentially analyze them to eliminate unlikely transmission pathways. After a full-text review to exclude these and focus on methodological approaches, 8 articles resulted which use Bayesian inference to recover transmission networks from multimodal data for infectious diseases, and which represent the topic of this review. This included Bayesian likelihood-based methods for integrating pathogen genomic information with temporal, spatial, and epidemiological characteristics for infectious diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD), and respiratory illnesses, including influenza. As incorporating genomic data simultaneously in analytical multimodal frameworks is a relatively novel idea, the literature on this is limited. Recent unified platforms have been made available to the community for analysis of outbreaks and storing of outbreak data [44] . Thus, it is essential to review available literature on this novel and burgeoning topic. For validation, we repeated our queries on Google Scholar. Although Google Scholar generated a much broader range of papers, based on the types of papers indexed, we verified that it also yielded the articles selected from PubMed. We are confident in our choice of articles for review as we have used two separate publications databases. Below we summarize the theoretical underpinnings of the likelihood-based framework approaches, inference parameters, and assumptions about each of these studies and articulate the limitations, which can motivate future research.",

[38] proposed a maximal spanning tree graph-based approach that went beyond existing phylogenetic methods. This method was utilized to uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of the influenza A (H1N1) from 2009 and to study its worldwide spread. A total of 433 gene sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) and of neuraminidase (NA) were obtained from GenBank. Classical phylogenetic approaches fail to capture the hierarchical relationship between both ancestors and descendants sampled at the same time. Using their algorithm called SeqTrack [48] , the authors constructed ancestries in samples based on a maximal-spanning tree. SeqTrack [38] utilizes the fact that in the absence of recombination and reverse mutations, strains will have unique ancestors characterized by the fewest possible mutations, no sample can be the ancestor of a sample which temporally preceded it, and the likelihood of ancestry can be estimated from the genomic differentiation between samples. SeqTrack was successful in reconstructing the transmission trees in both completely and incompletely sampled outbreaks unlike phylogenetic approaches, which failed to capture ancestral relationships between the tips of trees. However, this method cannot capture the underlying within-host virus genetic parameters. Moreover, mutations generated once can be present in different samples and transmission likelihood based on genetic distance may not be reliable.",

            "text": "Cottam et al. [40] developed one of the earliest methods to address this problem studying foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in twenty farms in the UK. In this study, FMD virus genomes (the FMD virus has a positive strand RNA genome and it is a member of the genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae) were collected from clinical samples from the infected farms. The samples were chosen so that they could be used to study variation within the outbreak and the time required for accumulation of genetic change, and to study transmission events. Total RNA was extracted directly from epithelial suspensions, blood, or esophageal suspensions. Sanger sequencing was performed on 42 overlapping amplicons covering the genome [53] . As the RNA virus has a high substitution rate, the number of mutations was sufficient to distinguish between different farms. They designed a maximum likelihood-based method incorporating complete genome sequences, date at which infection in a farm was identified, and the date of culling of the animals. The goal was to trace the transmission of FMD in Durham County, UK during the 2001 outbreak to infer the date of infection of animals and most likely period of their infectiousness. In their approach, they first generated the phylogenies of the viral genomes [54, 55] . Once the tip of the trees were generated, they constructed possible transmission trees by recursively working backwards to identify a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in the form of a farm and assigned each haplotype to a farm. The likelihood of each tree was then estimated using epidemiological data. Their study included assumptions of the mean incubation time prior to being infectious to be five days, the distribution of incubation times to follow a discrete gamma distribution, the most likely date of infection to be the date of reporting minus the date of the oldest reported lesion of the farm minus the mean incubation time, and the farms to be a source of infection immediately after being identified as infected up to the day of culling. Spatial dependence in the transmission events was determined from the transmission tree by studying mean transmission distance. [25] developed a Bayesian likelihood-based framework integrating genetic and epidemiological data. This method was tested on an epidemic dataset of 241 poultry farms in an epidemic of avian influenza A (H7N7) in The Netherlands in 2003 consisting of geographical, genomic, and date of culling data. Consensus sequences of the HA, NA and polymerase PB2 genes were derived by pooling sequence data from five infected animals for 185 out of the 241 farms analyzed. The likelihood of one farm infecting another increased if the former was not culled at the time of infection of the latter, if they were in geographical proximity, or if the sampled pathogen genomic sequences were related. Their model included several assumptions such as non-correlation of genetic distance, time of infection, and geographical distance between host and target farms. The likelihood function was generated as follows: for the temporal component, a farm could infect another if its infection time was before the infection time of the target farm or if the infection time of the latter was between the infection and culling time of the former. If a farm was already culled, its infectiousness decayed exponentially. For the geographical component, two farms could infect each other with likelihood equal to the inverse of the distance between them. This likelihood varied according to a spatial kernel. For the genomic component, probabilities of transitions and transversions, and the presence or absence of a deletion was considered. If there was no missing data, the likelihood function was just a product of independent geographical, genomic, and temporal components. This method also allowed missing data by assuming that all the links to a specific missing data type are in one subtree. MCMC [52] was performed to sample all possible transmission trees and parameters. Marginalizing over a large number of subtrees over all possible values can also prove computationally expensive. Mutations were assumed to be fixed in the population before or after an infection, ignoring a molecular clock.",

This method utilized the FMD dataset from the study by Cottam et al. In order to simplify the posterior distribution further, latent variables denoting unobserved pathogens were removed and a pseudo-distribution incorporating the genetic distance between the observed and measured consensus sequences was generated. The posterior distribution corresponded to a pseudo-posterior distribution because the pathogens were sampled at observation time and not infection time. The genetic distance was measured by Hamming distance between sequences in isolation without considering the entire genetic network. Several assumptions including independence of latency time and infectiousness period were made. In determining the interval from the end-of-latency period to detection, the informative prior was centered on lesion age. This made this inference technique sensitive to veterinary estimates of lesion age. This study considered a single source of viral introduction in the population, which is feasible if the population size considered is small.

The posterior probability distribution was estimated using the MCMC technique. The performance of the method was evaluated by measuring the probability assigned to actual transmission events. The assumptions made were that all infected hosts were observed, time of onset was known, sequences were sampled from a subpopulation of the infected hosts, and a single source/host introduced the infection in the population.

Unlike other existing studies, the authors took into account within-host evolution and did not assume that branches in phylogenetic trees correspond to actual transmission events. The generation time corresponds to the time between a host being infected and infecting others. For pathogens with short generation times, genetic diversity may not accrue to a very high degree and one can ignore within-host diversity. However, for diseases with high latency times and ones in which the host remains asymptomatic, there is scope for accumulation of considerable within-host genetic diversity. Their method used a timed phylogenetic tree from which a transmission tree is inferred on its own or can be combined with any available epidemiological support. Their simulations revealed that considering within-host pathogen generation intervals resulted in more realistic phylogenies between infector and infected. The method was tested on simulated datasets and with a real-world tuberculosis dataset with a known outbreak source with only genomic data and then modified using any available epidemiological data. The latter modified network resembled more the actual transmission activity in having a web-like layout and fewer bidirectional links. Their approach would work well for densely sampled outbreaks.",

In Cottam's [40] approach, the phylogenetic trees generated from the genomic data are weighed by epidemiological factors to limit analysis to possible transmission trees. However, sequential approaches may not be ideal to reconstruct transmission trees and a method that combines all modalities in a single likelihood function may be necessary. Ypma et al. [25] assumed that pathogen mutations emerge in the host population immediately before or following infections. Moreover, the approach weighed each data type via their likelihood functions and considers each data type independent of the others, which may not be a realistic assumption. Jombart et al. [38] also inferred ancestral relationships to the most closely sampled ancestor as all ancestors may not be sampled. Morelli et al. [24] assumed flat priors for all model parameters. However, the method was estimated with the prior for the duration from latency to infection centered on the lesion age making the method sensitive to it and to veterinary assessment of infection age. The method developed by Mollentze et al. [49] required knowledge of epidemiology for infection and incubation periods. Identifying parents of infected nodes, as proposed by Teunis et al., [56] assumes that all infectious cases were observed which may not be true in realistic, partiallyobserved outbreaks. Didelot et al. [26] developed a framework based on a timed phylogenetic tree, which infers within-host evolutionary dynamics with a constant population size and denselysampled outbreaks.",

The specific focus in this review on the application of network inference in infectious disease transmission enables us to consider and comment on common parameters, data types and assumptions (summarized in Table 1 ). Novel data sources have increased the resolution of information as well as enabled a closer monitoring and study of interactions; spatial and genomic resolution of the Bayesian network-inference studies reviewed are summarized in Fig. 4 to illustrate the scope of current methods. Further, we have added suggestions for addressing identified challenges in these methods regarding their common assumptions and parameters in Table 2 .

Another approach to improve the granularity of collected data could be community-generated data. These data can be finegrained and can capture information on a wide range of cases from asymptomatic to mildly infectious to severe. This data can be utilized to incorporate additional transmission parameters of a community which can be more representative of disease transmission. As exemplified in Fig. 4a , community-generated data can be collected at the fine-grained spatial level of households, schools, workplaces, or zip codes and models must then also accommodate these spatial resolutions.",

In general, this will enable understanding and interpretation of influence and information propagation by mapping relationships between nodes in other applications.",
