The viruses have four structural proteins; the protein of greatest serological importance is found at the peplomer tip. The viral structural proteins separated by isoelectric focusing were identified by comparison to SDS-PAGE separations. Three protein bands were identical in pl and one protein band showed a difference in pZ between strains. When the renatured viral proteins were Western blotted and reacted with strain-specific antiserum, antigen-antibody complexing was seen only at points corresponding to the strain-specific variant bands. For IBV strain Mass-41, antigenantibody complexing occurred at a pl of 6.8, and, for IBV strain Ark-99, at 7.2. No cross reaction of antisera was observed for either strain.",

            "text": "More than thirty IBV strains and numerous strain variants are now classified by serological criteria King and Hopkins, 1983) . The varying pathology is demonstrated in animals or by embryo testing (Naqui et al., 1988) . Biophysical methods such as isoelectric focusing (IEF) and high-performance liquid chromatography suggest quantitative criteria independent of conventional serology and animal testing by which virus strains can be classified. Groupings of viruses by serology do not always give clear delineations of strains and serological tests can give imprecise information with regard to minor strain variation which may result in altered pathogenicity during animal infections. The interior viral proteins tend to be evolutionarily conserved, in contrast to the outer proteins which can be highly variable (Yagyu and Ohta, 1990) . The primary antigenic area of Coronavir-us IBV, the epitope to which protective antibody is made, is located on the more distal subunit of the peplomer or spike (S-l) of the virus. This area controls cell attachment and virus neutralization (VN), determining the virus' tissue affinity and the greater part of its serological grouping (Cavanagh, 1983) . Variations of these distal epitopes influence the ability of the virus to attach to specific cell receptors. Altered antigenicity as detected using serum neutralization is due to variation in the surface proteins of a virus. In the case of IBV, alteration in ability to be neutralized by antisera is due primarily to variation in the S-1 protein which forms the peplomer tip (Cavanagh, 1983) . Change in the protein is caused mainly by amino acid alterations, which very often leads to an alteration of the total charge on S-1. The resulting alteration of charge can be detected by a separation of the viral proteins based on the charge on each of the constituent protein molecules. The charge of the molecules can be demonstrated by allowing the dissociated proteins to migrate in an electric field through a stabilized pH gradient until they reach theirpoints of charge neutrality (pZ) (Dunbar, 1989; Bond et al., 1979) .",

In the mature virion, several copies of the S-l subunit form the tip of the peplomer and several copies of the S-2 subunit together span the membrane .

There are conserved epitopes and, although S-2 does not contain the dominant antigenic sites (Cavanagh et al., 1986b) , binding of antibodies on S-2 epitopes may enhance peplomer conformational changes or create steric effects leading to rapid and efficient binding and neutralizing by other antibodies at S-l epitopes (Niesters et al., 1987; Mockett et al., 1984) .",

S-l has I7 potential glycosylation sites (Sutou et al., 1988) , 16 of which were shown to be conserved among 31 strains of IBV . Antigenically closely related strains may have up to 97% S-1 sequence homology (Cavanagh and Davis, 1986) , while distantly related strains approach 50% homology . Serotype and other surface antigenic determinants are located in the N' end of the S-l protein ) and a single amino-acid change in their conformation-depen-dent neu~alization ~pitope(s) may create a new variant (Deaet al., 1990) . A rapid rate of evolution in the S-1 protein sequence can be expected, due to the high mutation rate of the single-stranded RNA genome coupled with the selective pressure favoring the propagation of strains resistant to individual and/or flock immunity (Cavanagh and Davis, 1988 ). S-l neutralization epitopes are comprised of clusters of mutations which have been shown to physically correspond to regions of mutations in the genome. There are no clearly defined hypervariable regions, but in a comparison of 3 1 strains of IBV, a greater number of replacements has been shown to occur in two areas (in amino acid residues 50-l 70 and 250-3 10) and a greater number of insertions and deletions can be located in a portion of the first area (in residues 120-170) .

Glycosylation may affect antigenicity and tissue affinity by the carbohydrate side chains which are part of the antigenic determinant of S-1; or, the attachment of carbohydrate may affect overall folding of the S-l protein, altering the conformation and influencing antigenicity at points far removed from the actual point of carbohydrate attachment. Viral variation may be enhanced by the microheterogenous nature of the surface protein's glycosylation. Virus released from cells in which the glycosylation has not progressed to the same level as the earlier made virions could result in 'accidentally variant' viruses which may then be able to enter a different type of cell by virtue of the altered pattern of their cell attachment sites. These variants may in turn be acted upon by different cellular proteases found in other cell types, so that the cutting of the S-O protein might be altered, thus increasing the possibility of divergent phenotypes. Mass-4 1 and Ark-99 strains of IBV have been shown to be genetically and serologically distinct strains by means of oligonucleotide fingerprinting (Naqui et al., 1988; Kusters et al., 1989) and extensive cross neutralization studies using VN and HI tests (King, 1988; Cowen and Hitchner, 1975) . One-dimensional SDS-PAGE studies of IBV virus, which do not distinguish strains or antigenic variants, show two major proteins and two minor proteins in strains of IB virus (Cavanagh and Davis 1986) . SDS-PAGE fails to distinguish between the similar sized minor protein subunits of the peplomer proteins (S-l and S-2), nor does it detect the most frequent mutations (amino-acid substitutions or alterations of glycosylation) which do not result in substantial molecular weight differences (Lominiczi and Morser, 1988) .",

The criteria of purity have been: the comparison of published SDS-PAGE separations and their similarity to SDS-PAGE separations done in this laboratory on the same purified virus; isopycnic banding of each virus, indicating homogenous density; sedimentation rate, suggesting homogeneity of size and shape; uniform 260-280 nm ultraviolet absorption ratios, indicating relatively the same amounts of nucleic acids and proteins in each strain; the ability of strain-specific antibody to clump or agglutinate purified virus of each strain as visualized by electron microscopy. Although they do not rule out minor protein contamination, these criteria make it unlikely that bands found by IEF are other than viral structural proteins. The IEF bands produced from egg fluids (Fig. 1) did not correspond to any viral bands.",
