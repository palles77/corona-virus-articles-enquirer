Compared with some existing systems, the new program package has the merits of simplicity, high accuracy, reliability, and quickness. The system ZCURVE_CoV has been run for each of the 11 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes. Consequently, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. In addition to the polyprotein chain ORFs 1a and 1b and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins, spike (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nuleocaspid (N), respectively, ZCURVE_CoV also predicts 5-6 putative proteins in length between 39 and 274 amino acids with unknown functions. Some single nucleotide mutations within these putative coding sequences have been detected and their biological implications are discussed. A web service is provided, by which a user can obtain the annotated result immediately by pasting the SARS-CoV genome sequences into the input window on the web site (http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/). The software ZCURVE_CoV can also be downloaded freely from the web address mentioned above and run in computers under the platforms of Windows or Linux.",

In the Z curve method, essentially, the gene recognition is based on the com-positional asymmetry of three codon positions in coding sequences. It was shown that the overall extent of codon usage bias in RNA viruses is low and there is little variation in bias between genes [15] . Coronaviruses belong to the coronaviridae and the G + C content of the published coronavirus genomes ranges from 37% to 42% [7] . Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the published coronavirus genomes have similar codon usage. Based on this consideration, it is possible that gene-finding parameters derived from some published coronavirus genomes may be applied to recognize genes in other coronavirus genomes. Because the SARS-CoV genomes are relatively small (%30 kb), it is difficult to obtain enough seed ORFs from its own genome. Therefore, we used some other published coronavirus genomes to train gene-finding parameters. Consequently, the genomes of avian infectious bronchitis virus, bovine coronavirus, human coronavirus 229E, murine hepatitis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, respectively, were used, in which 48 seed ORFs were selected. The detailed information about the 48 seed ORFs is described in Table 1 of the supplementary materials (see: http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/).",

A method to produce negative samples has been developed previously and it has been shown to be an effective way to solve the problem [12] . The same method is still used in the current study. In this method, a negative sample is just derived from a seed ORF. Generally speaking, if the regular structure of a coding sequence is completely destroyed, it is transformed into a non-coding one. Therefore, the negative sample may be simply obtained by shuffling the corresponding coding sequence sufficiently (20,000 times in current study). The resulting random sequences from all 48 seed ORFs were used as non-coding sequences. The major difference is that the former has some regular structures, whereas the latter is a random sequence. In fact, a random sequence is not a non-coding sequence, but it is a good approximation. As shown below, this approximation generally results in good genefinding results.",

The genome of TOR2 strain was annotated manually [8] and the annotated result is listed on the left part of Table 2 , whereas the annotated result of ZCURVE_CoV 1.0 is listed on the right part of Table 2 . As we can see both annotations are in good agreement with each other, except three ORFs. The three ORFs, i.e., ORF4, ORF13, and ORF14 annotated by Marra et al. [8] are not predicted by ZCURVE_CoV 1.0. These ORFs are completely embedded, with a frameshift, within the genes coding for some structural proteins. The absence of the transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) at the 5 0 end of these ORFs [8] suggests that they are unlikely to be the protein-coding genes. The principal component analysis performed below further confirms the above conjecture. As mentioned in the Materials and methods section, each ORF is represented by a point in a 9-dimensional (9-D) space. Consequently, the positive samples (genes) and negative samples (non-coding sequences) are represented by two groups of points in the 9-D space, respectively. For the TOR2 strain, the 12 putative genes predicted by ZCURVE_CoV and ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14 are represented by the corresponding points in the 9-D space, respectively. We project the points in the 9-D space onto the 3-D space spanned by the first, second, and third principal axes based on the principal component analysis. The fraction of the first three principal components accounts for about 70% of the total inertia of the 9-D space. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the corresponding points in the 3-D space, where green and orange balls represent the positive samples (genes) and negative samples (noncoding sequences), respectively. Blue balls correspond to the genes predicted by ZCURVE_CoV for the TOR2 strain, while red balls correspond to ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14 annotated by Marra et al. [8] .

The high mutation rate of Sars274 implies that either it might be a relatively unimportant protein for SARS-CoV, or the mutations do not lead to biological function changes dramatically.

Accumulating evidence has shown that SARS is caused by a new coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV. A new system to recognize protein-coding genes in SARS-CoV genomes, called ZCURVE_CoV, has been reported in this paper. By applying the program to 11 complete SARS-CoV genomes, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. It is shown that the three protein-coding ORFs annotated by Marra et al. [8] , i.e., ORF 4, ORF 13, and ORF 14, are very unlikely to code for proteins. In addition to ORF1a, ORF1b, and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins S, E, M, and N, the new system ZCURVE_CoV also predicts 5-6 putative genes coding for non-structural proteins. Aligning each of the non-structural gene sequences based on the 11 complete genomes, some mutations have been detected. The biological implications of the mutations have been discussed.",
