It was eventually eradicated from Hong Kong after a mass cull of all poultry, but it apparently continued to circulate asymptomatically amongst birds in southern China, 2 from where it eventually reemerged in the human population in 2002 to 2003 and has been causing ongoing sporadic human infection and disease, with a high mortality (close to 60%) till present. As of August 31, 2009 , the World Health Organization has reported 440 cases of sporadic H5N1 human infection, of which 262 were lethal (a 60% case-fatality rate). 3 In addition, sporadic, generally mild (although there has been at least 1 recorded death because of H7N7) human infections resulting from occasional bird-to-human transmissions, with low pathogenic avian influenza strains (eg, subtypes H9N2, H7N7, H7N2, and H7N3) have been ongoing since 1997, when heightened surveillance for avian influenza viruses began (Fig. 2) . 4 So far, all these low pathogenic avian influenza viruses isolated from these sporadic human infections have been genetically similar to the corresponding avian influenza viruses circulating in birds. Thus, so far and within the limits of current surveillance, there seems to have been no further reassortment of these viruses with either human or swine influenza viruses. Until recently, avian influenza A (H5N1) was considered the prime virus subtype candidate for causing the next influenza pandemic.",

The 1968 A (H3N2) virus was also a reassortant strain in which the HA and PB1 gene segments from an avian influenza strain reassorted with the then currently circulating A (H2N2) virus. 10 Since 1977, this A (H3N2) virus has been cocirculating with an A (H1N1) strain similar to the 1918 A (H1N1) pandemic virus, which was accidentally released from a laboratory. 11 Thus, these 2 viruses have now become familiar to us as the seasonal influenza A subtypes for more than 30 years. Analyses of the viruses that caused the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics therefore proved that zoonotic transmissions of influenza viruses (ie, from animals to man) with gene reassortment were capable of generating antigenically new influenza strains, novel to human immunity, with significant effects on the public health.",

Generally, patients with H5N1 virus infection were hospitalized 4 to 6 days after onset of illness. 18 Common laboratory findings in patients with A (H5N1) infection at the time of hospital admission include leukopenia, lymphopenia, and mild-to-moderate thrombocytopenia. 19 However, for patients with a clinically mild illness, there was no decrease in the white cell count. Chest radiographic findings included patchy, interstitial, lobar, and/or diffuse infiltrates; consolidation; pleural effusion; and pneumothorax. In fatal A (H5N1) cases, the median time from onset to death was 9 days. 18 The fatality rate among hospitalized patients has been high and varies considerably between countries (33%-100%), although the true rate maybe much lower because of an unknown number of milder nonfatal infections in the community. 20 Acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated 76.5% (13 in 17) of cases in Thailand and 44.4% (8 in 18) of cases in Hong Kong. Multiple organ failure, with signs of renal dysfunction and sometimes cardiac compromise, was often noted. In the severe human A (H5N1) infections in Hong Kong, reactive hemophagocytic syndrome was a unique pathologic feature in 3 fatal cases, as were increased blood levels of interferon-a, tumor necrosis factor a, and other cytokines, providing evidence that cytokine responses contributed to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 infections. 21 Exactly how the severity of illness varies by clade or subclade of H5N1 virus infection, by age, or by immunologic, genetic, or other factors is unknown. 18 Most patients who died did not have a preexisting disease, in contrast to situations where other subtypes of human influenza virus infections caused epidemics during interpandemic periods. However, patients with underlying cardiovascular, pulmonary, or renal diseases were, as expected, still more susceptible to severe influenza infection. 20",

All patients had fever, cough, dyspnea or respiratory distress, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and bilateral patchy pneumonia (Fig. 3) . Other common findings were an increased creatine kinase level (in 62% of the patients) and lymphopenia (in 61%). Twelve patients required mechanical ventilation, and 7 died. Within 7 days after contact with the initial case patients, a mild Tang et al or moderate influenzalike illness developed in 22 health care workers, none of whom required hospitalization. 22 In a study of 642 confirmed cases of human A (H1N1) 2009 infection identified from the rapidly evolving US outbreak in April 2009, the age of patients ranged from 3 months to 81 years; 60% of patients were 18 years old or younger. Of patients with available data, 18% had recently traveled to Mexico and 16% were identified from 2009. The initial appearance is suggestive of a developing viral pneumonitis, which then seems to resolve (A-C), but then the patient probably developed a secondary bacterial infection (although not proven conclusively) (D) that necessitated a transfer to the intensive care unit (E) before finally resolving (F). The patient was finally discharged feeling well, with no long-term sequelae. (Courtesy of University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.) school outbreaks of A (H1N1) 2009 infection. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (92%), and sore throat (66%); 25% of patients had diarrhea, and 25% had vomiting. Of the 399 patients for whom hospitalization status was known, 36 (9%) required hospitalization and 2 died. 12 A Canadian study also reported cough in 90% of patients but fever in only 59% of confirmed and probable cases. Other common symptoms included headache (83%), sore throat (76%), and nasal congestion (76%). None of the cases was admitted to hospital. No deaths were associated with the cluster. 23 It is now becoming clear that most cases of A (H1N1) 2009 infection are mild and self-limiting and present in a manner that is indistinguishable from seasonal influenza. As for seasonal influenza, those with preexisting medical conditions such as the traditional chronic diseases (eg, diabetes, asthma, renal or cardiac failure, and any form of immunosuppression) seem to be at greater risk of severe disease and death (and are therefore routinely targeted for the annual seasonal influenza immunization). Even so, with this virus, it has been suggested that obesity may be an additional risk factor for serious disease, 24 as is pregnancy, 25 which is also a recognized risk in seasonal influenza infection.",

            "text": "The age distribution of infection with this novel virus also differs from seasonal influenza. For example, the older age groups (>65 years) have always been considered to be vulnerable to seasonal influenza infection, but they seem to be less frequently infected by this novel virus. This trend is now thought to be caused by some preexisting cross-reacting immunity to this virus as a result of their past exposure to the older circulating seasonal influenza A (H1N1) strains that have been more similar to the current pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 virus. The current circulating seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus and its corresponding seasonal influenza vaccine antigen components seem to not provide any cross-immunity to the pandemic strain. 26 In the more frequently targeted younger adult age groups, an unusual feature has been observed; more patients in this group progress to more serious respiratory disease, whereas there is also a significant gastrointestinal component (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in 10%-50% of cases) involved. 12 In addition, in children infected with A (H1N1) 2009, the incidence of seizures seems to be prominent. Although this is also seen with seasonal influenza, 27 the few recent case reports available so far suggest that outcomes are better with the pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 infection. 28 Antivirals For all these influenza subtypes, apart from the usual respiratory support and monitoring, there are only a few specific antiviral drugs for treatment. In the cases of seasonal influenza A (H3N2), avian influenza A (H5N1), and pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009, virtually all these viruses are resistant to treatment with the adamantane drugs (amantadine and rimantadine) but still susceptible to the NA inhibitors (NAIs) such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. In the case of seasonal influenza A (H1N1), most viruses are resistant to oseltamivir (although zanamivir is still effective in most cases) but still susceptible to the adamantane drugs, although resistance seems to be increasing. Another member of the NAI group, peramivir, is still in clinical trials. Peramivir has an advantage over oseltamivir (taken orally) and zanamivir (taken by inhalation) in that it can be given intravenously. Combination therapy with oseltamivir and rimantadine can be given empirically if the influenza subtype is unknown, and some patients infected with A (H1N1) 2009 have been given this combination as initial empiric therapy. 28 According to the manufacturer's information, oseltamivir is generally well tolerated and its adverse effects are mild and mainly gastrointestinal (ie, nausea, vomiting, Tang et al diarrhea). However, reports from the use of oseltamivir as postexposure prophylaxis (75 mg once daily for 10 days) in primary and secondary school children (age, 4-12 years) have described additional symptoms such as feeling sick, headaches, stomach aches, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, and poor concentration. 29, 30 Table 1 shows the currently recommended NAI doses for treatment and postexposure prophylaxis for patients of different ages. Treatment is recommended for 5 days, whereas prophylaxis is recommended for at least 2 weeks or a minimum of 7 days (eg, at least 10 days as per CDC recommendations in Table 1 ) after contact with the last infected individual and onset of illness. Pediatric dosing is based on weight for those weighing less than 40 kg and older than 1 year. For children younger than 1 year, oseltamivir is not licensed to be administered; however, it can be used on an ''emergency authorization use'' basis, for which the recommended dosing regimen is also shown in Table 1 . There should be careful monitoring for adverse effects when the drug is used in this younger age group outside its licensure.",

Resistance to oseltamivir arising in patients treated with it has been reported in a few cases so far. The most commonly reported resistance mutation, H275Y, occurs in the NA gene. 34, 35 The incidence and prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant A (H1N1) 2009 viruses is likely to increase, given the continued widespread use of the drug for treatment. However, oseltamivir should be used for treating only severely ill cases of A (H1N1) 2009 infection (as per seasonal influenza use recommendations) and not for postexposure prophylaxis unless vulnerable groups have been exposed. 32 There has been one case of oseltamivir resistance reported in an individual with no history of oseltamivir use. 36 The issue of worry then is whether such resistant viruses will eventually become fit enough to transmit efficiently in the population (perhaps displacing the wild-type susceptible virus), making the worldwide stockpiles of oseltamivir effectively useless.",

Other countries are in the process of approving the vaccine, and it is likely that vaccines against the pandemic influenza virus will be widely available in most countries by the time this article is published. The rapid licensing of this new vaccine has only been made possible by the urgency of the pandemic situation and the application of existing seasonal influenza vaccine manufacturing regulations that do not require annual changes in influenza antigen composition of the seasonal influenza vaccine to undergo relicensing each year. To make the limited supply of these vaccines go further, lower antigenic doses and different adjuvants are being tested to immunize as much of the population as required. 41 In addition, individual vaccination benefits the population as a whole by reducing the number of susceptible individuals who can be infected by the virus. Given the currently accepted relatively low value for the reproductive number (R o ) of 1 to 2, 13,14 less than 60% (where required vaccine coverage, V c , is estimated by the formula V c 5 1 \u00c0 1/R o ) of the population requires vaccination to curtail the onward transmission of influenza. However, there are significant technical (ie, how to make and deliver such a huge amount of vaccine in a short time), moral, and economic (ie, who gets vaccinated first and for what price) challenges that will be faced by the planned global immunization program against the pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus. 42, 43 With such large populations being vaccinated, there needs to be careful monitoring for common and rarer (eg, Guillan-Barr e syndrome) adverse effects. 44 Postexposure prophylaxis with oseltamivir for those in close contact with confirmed cases has already been discussed. The disadvantage of mass prophylaxis has been seen in school children when the incidence of adverse effects may be greater than the incidence of secondary infections. 29, 30 This situation becomes more relevant with lower estimates of influenza transmissibility (ie, the lower the value of R o ), although this may be higher in certain situations, such as the dense crowding seen in schools and other public entertainment venues.",

One well-investigated example of this has been the effects of school closure on the subsequent progression of an influenza pandemic. Various mathematical modeling studies have suggested that, although there may be some delay in the spread of the pandemic from closing schools, this measure will only be effective if the subsequent behavior of children outside the school does not result in a similar number of contacts and that such relative isolation is prolonged during the pandemic period. However, the social and economic disruption for the working parents with such a strategy may be difficult to overcome because at least one parent will have to take time off work to look after young children at home. In particular, school closure has to be part of an overall mitigation strategy, including the treatment and home isolation of infected individuals to reduce further contacts. 15 Air travel can rapidly transport infections between different destinations around the world and also act as a source for generating new infections within the crowded confines of modern passenger planes. Various mathematical modeling tools have been used to assess the effect of restricting air travel on the spread of pandemic influenza. However, the benefits may be fairly minor and may not be worth the inevitable and serious social and economic disruption this will cause. 46 The possible nonpharmaceutical public health interventions are summarized in Box 1. 47",

Such understanding allows more effective public health surveillance of seasonal human influenza viruses, as well as candidate pandemic viruses that may cross the species barrier from animals to humans. Development in antiviral drugs for influenza is still slow (compared with rapid advances and the variety in the case of anti-human immunodeficiency virus drugs), but this is counterbalanced by the effective and highly organized and regulated vaccinemanufacturing base that is already in existence for the seasonal influenza vaccines. Unlike infectious agents that infect humans only (such as smallpox and measles), influenza viruses, being zoonotic (with animal and human reservoirs), will continue to pose a persistent and variable threat to human health for the foreseeable future. It is therefore important that systems are in place, in health care institutions and in the general community, to react and adapt quickly to limit human morbidity and mortality caused by this ever-changing pathogen.",

The 1918 Spanish flu influenza and classic swine influenza probably originated from an avian influenza virus population at some point in the past, but arrows indicating their origins have been omitted here because the exact species-crossing events cannot be defined for certain and remain controversial. The reassortment events generating the H3N2 Hong Kong flu pandemic strain have been simplified here because of space constraints.
