            "text": "Background: Although Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) diagnostic delays remain a major challenge in health systems, the source of delays has not been recognized in the literature. The aim of this study is to quantify patient and health-system delays and to identify their associated factors. Methods: The study of 266 patients was based on public source data from the World Health Organization (WHO) (January 2, 2017-May 16, 2018). The diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were calculated and modelled using a Poisson regression analysis. Results: In 266 MERS-CoV patients reported during the study period, the median diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were 5 days (interquartile [IQR] range: 3-8 days), 4 days (IQR range: 2-7 days), and 2 days (IQR range: 1-2 days), respectively. Both patient delay (r = 0.894, P = 0.001) and health-system delay (r = 0.163, P = 0.025) were positively correlated with diagnostic delay. Older age was associated with longer health-system delay (adjusted relative ratios (aRR), 1.011; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.004-1.017). Diagnostic delay (aRR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.006-1.285) and health-system delays (aRR, 1.217; 95% CI, 1.003-1.476) were significantly longer in patients who died. Conclusion: Delays in MERS-CoV diagnosis exist and may be attributable to patient delay and healthsystem delay as both were significantly correlated with longer diagnosis delay. Early MERS-CoV diagnosis may require more sensitive risk assessment tools to reduce avoidable delays, specifically those related to patients and health system.",

            "text": "Delays in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) diagnosis are a serious challenge to health systems worldwide due to the potential transmission clusters in communities and in healthcare facilities [1, 2] . Despite the presence of clinical suspicion in a majority of the MERS-CoV cases [3, 4] , delays in diagnosis and seeking prompt medical care remain common among MERS-CoV patients [5] . A South Korean study reported substantial lag duration between suspected clinical symptom onset and MERS-CoV laboratory confirmation, with a median of 6.5 days on 37 MERS-CoV infection cases [6] . Delayed diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection contributes positively to recovery delay [4] and poor prognosis [7, 8] . In MERS-CoV patients, diagnostic delay may be attributed to the patient and/or to the health system which remain unaddressed in this population. Understanding the various sources of delays in diagnosis and in seeking medical care for MERS-CoV infection may be among the most essential efforts to improve the diagnostic process, as it is necessary to control transmission and optimize medical care.",

Since first identified in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 and until 31 May 2018, 2220 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been reported globally (with a fatality rate of 35.6%), in which 1844 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (WHO, 2018). The study author extracted and included all MERS-CoV cases reported between January 2, 2017 and the latest report on May 16, 2018. The study covers this period because the WHO uses standardized case presentations to report the date of MERS-CoV symptom onset, date of first hospitalization, and date of MERS-CoV laboratory confirmation.

According to the study, patient delay significantly correlates with MERS-CoV diagnostic delay (r = 0.894, P = 0.001). The frequent long patient delay in seeking medical care after experiencing MERS-CoV symptoms may reflect limited patients' awareness of, and knowledge of MERS-CoV symptoms [9] [10] [11] and the need for health education programs for the public [9, 10] , and healthcare practitioners [10, 11] The median health-system delay was 2 days (IQR range: 1-2 days) with 86% of patients being diagnosed with MERS-CoV within two days after first hospitalization. This study shows that healthsystem delay significantly correlates with the MERS-CoV diagnostic delay (r = 0.163, P = 0.025). The health-system delay in identifying a MERS-CoV case may be attributed to the delay in the virus recognition in medical institutions [6] and to the limited awareness among healthcare-workers [11] , as a survey conducted on 1216 healthcare-workers revealed that only 47.6% of the physicians and 30.4% of the nurses were aware that some infected patients had no symptoms [11] . Also diagnosis of MERS-CoV [3] and medical care for patients with MERS-CoV [12] remain major challenges in healthcare facilities. Further understanding on the causes of patient and health-system delay is needed, as it can be used as a modifiable factor to reduce diagnostic delay and to improve the diagnostic process.",

Significant findings in this study must be interpreted carefully, as it indicates correlation rather than causation. Patient and health-system delays were calculated using the date of first hospitalization rather than the date of first consultation in a health facility or a first doctor's visit. Despite these limitations, this is the first study to assess the source of MERS-CoV diagnostic delays (patient and health-system). Early diagnosis of MERS-CoV [3] and its delay [5] continues to be a major challenge, since neither has been sufficiently discussed in previous literature. Furthermore, the study identified several potential interventions related to the decision-making process at patient, doctor, and health-system levels to shorten avoidable delays in the MERS-CoV diagnosis process following symptoms and first doctor visit.",
