However, future catastrophic natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics, nuclear device detonations, or large chemical exposures may change usual disaster epidemiology and require a large critical care response. This article reviews the existing state of emergency preparedness for mass critical illness and presents an analysis of limitations to support the suggestions of the Task Force on Mass Casualty Critical Care, which are presented in subsequent articles. Baseline shortages of specialized resources such as critical care staff, medical supplies, and treatment spaces are likely to limit the number of critically ill victims who can receive life-sustaining interventions. The deficiency in critical care surge capacity is exacerbated by lack of a sufficient framework to integrate critical care within the overall institutional response and coordination of critical care across local institutions and broader geographic areas.",

However, with the anticipation of large volumes of critically ill patients in future disasters, some believe that hospital capacity, and in particular critical care capability, will be a major limiting factor for survival. 15, 19 Numerous authorities have forecast scenarios that will result in large numbers of critically ill and injured casualties.

Eleven of the 15 scenarios predict numbers of critically ill patients ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands in a metropolitan area.

            "text": "The experience with the severe acute respiratory syndrome in Toronto, although not a mass casualty event, stands as example where critical care can prevent deaths even for a disease lacking specific treatment. In the absence of critical care, the case fatality rate in Toronto would have been more than triple (20%) the observed rate of 6.5%. 20 This lesson may have profound import were a serious influenza pandemic to occur. Further, the effectiveness of community mitigation as well as the utility and availability of antivirals to forestall serious illness remain uncertain. 21, 22 Many people, particularly high-risk groups, may have critical illness 23 and without critical care will assuredly die. If critical illness directly or indirectly resulting from influenza is not uniformly fatal with essential critical care services, then availability of life-sustaining interventions may have a profound impact on community survival. 24 The need to augment critical care is not unique to an influenza pandemic. Illness developing after exposures to chemicals, 25 infection with serious pathogens, and exposure to radiologic materials are all likely to result in life-threatening clinical conditions, such as severe sepsis or ARDS. Natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes 26 -28 and tsunamis, 29 can also generate many victims with severe organ dysfunction. In the United States and Canada, severe sepsis and acute respiratory failure, including ARDS, are commonly treated in ICUs 30 -32 ; and importantly, at least half of patients survive with aggressive ICU care. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Unlike the duration of surge demands on emergency departments (EDs) in mass casualty incidents, which are often measured in units of minutes or hours, the critical care response may need to be sustained for days to weeks. Several recent examples highlight this issue. Following the Rhode Island nightclub fire, the emergency department (ED) response lasted only hours, yet 47 critically ill patients admitted to a single hospital resulted in 406 ICU patient days with an average ICU length of stay of 21 days. 39 Similarly, following the 2005 London bombings, the major incident lasted in the ED lasted 3 h and 14 min, yet the average length of stay for the critically injured was 12.4 days (range, 6 to 22 days). 16, 40 Complications seen in the critically ill or injured, such as ARDS, prolong recovery times in ICU 16, [41] [42] [43] and should be anticipated in planning for future mass critical care events.",

Although a rather simplistic conceptual approach, one can confidently state that a system that fails to meet any one of these requirements will not be able to cope with a large surge.

Numerous logistic hurdles will hamper immediate distribution to areas of need during a disaster. Thousands of ventilators may be available at hospitals nationwide, yet an affected community requiring just hundreds of additional devices may not be able to get them in a timely manner. Also, published and unpublished models of varying sophistication portend there will still be a large gap between the total number of ventilators required during the peak of a serious influenza pandemic and available devices. 23,49 -51 In all models, the predicted need will far exceed even the tens of thousands of available ventilators.

There are a variety of inotropes and vassopressors that are interchangeable again increasing availability. However, oxygen remains a critical consumable resource which has a limited supply and distribution network. Most hospitals rely on large storage tanks of liquid oxygen. If this source runs low, oxygen must be trucked in from a supplier. The number of suppliers of medical grade oxygen in North America is limited as are the number of tanker trucks available to transport oxygen. Portable oxygen supplies for use during an infrastructure failure or in 12S off-site critical care facilities are very limited, inefficient and not included in the strategic national stockpile. 44 Staff Like many areas of health care, critical care units face shortages of various team members 56 required for critical care delivery. 44, 50, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] Data from Ontario show that 49% of critical care units had nursing vacancies and 20% had physician vacancies. 50 ICUs facing staffing shortages are routinely forced to cancel surgeries and divert ED admissions to other hospitals. 50 The need to resort to such actions even in non-surge periods bespeaks the limited surge capacity in the critical care system.",

As with staffing, some hospitals face shortages of critical care spaces, 46,71-73 although occupancy varies across the United States. In Ontario in 2006, there were 1,789 critical care beds, 1,057 of which were capable of accommodating mechanical ventilation. 74 The occupancy rate for these beds approaches 90%. 50 Demands on critical care resources are expected to increase in both the United States and Canada as the populations age. 75 On a day-to-day basis, additional capacity can be created in the critical care system by expanding critical care to areas of the hospital such as the postanesthesia care unit. However, this expansion is still limited by the issues of stuff and staff discussed earlier. Therefore, even though the bed spaces may be available to use for critical care, if the hospital rents its ventilators and has no more on site, the ability to expand critical care remains limited unless specific advanced planning and preparation are undertaken. Finally, although it is possible to convert off-site locations 17, 53 (ie, hotels, gymnasiums, sports fields) into medical treatment facilities, the ability to convert such areas to critical care facilities on a large scale is curtailed because of the functional requirements and logistical challenges, such as large-volume portable oxygen supplies.",

However, this is often difficult to do during a disaster when ambulances are occupied with the ongoing prehospital response. Moreover, most areas will not have a sufficient number of dedicated critical care transport teams to evacuate large numbers of critically ill; thus, regular critical care staff would be required.

The US federal health response includes the NDMS to address medical and mental health needs during a disaster. 79 The NDMS was created to address civilian disasters and military contingencies in which there might be a large number of casualties that cannot be accommodated by the Departments of Defense or Veterans Affairs. 76 The NDMS is a private/public partnership that includes a number of specialized teams comprising some 7,000 to 8,000 volunteers and a network of 2,000 hospitals with a total of approximately 100,000 beds. Similar teams are being developed elsewhere in North America. 52 The NDMS has been a valuable resource in many prior disasters. 80 However, there are significant concerns that the system is not equipped to respond to an event involving large numbers of critically ill patients, particularly a biological event, such as a pandemic. 14 Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs) of the NDMS are made up of practicing clinicians who will leave their local communities and deploy to disaster sites. While it may be possible to piece together a team or two of available volunteers from a distant unaffected area to respond to a geographically isolated event, it will be a significant challenge to find enough available DMAT members to meet the needs of many communities during a widespread event, such as an influenza pandemic or simultaneous terrorist attacks in major cities across the nation.",
