Transmitted from person to person, more than 28,000 people were ultimately infected, and more than 11,000 were killed, with the bulk of the cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. 1 As local health care systems struggled to respond to the large number of infected patients, health care providers from the United States and other countries responded to the outbreak in Africa through multiple aid organizations. These heroic individuals were faced with providing care to very ill patients with limited clinical resources. The hysteria over EVD in the media and among the state and local agencies responsible for making decisions regarding the monitoring and quarantine of returning health care workers were reminiscent of challenges encountered in the early days of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) crisis of the 1980s. 2 The media was concurrently attempting to cover the unprecedented outbreak while sharing public policy on the situation throughout the events. 3 In the fall of 2014, a patient who had recently traveled from West Africa was treated at a hospital in the United States. The patient was eventually confirmed to have EVD, ultimately resulting in 2 nurses who had direct contact with the patient also acquiring the illness. 4 EVD is a viral illness with some overlapping symptoms of other common and travel-related illnesses, so educating the public became critical to prevent panic and public concern regarding transmission of the virus (Fig. 1) .",

Despite this, the consensus statement specifically suggested the use of N95 respirators or powered air purifying respirators for respiratory protection to protect health care workers in light of several situations in which transmission could not be fully explained. 6 At the time, the knowledge of EVD and the other viral hemorrhagic fevers was largely limited to primate studies and learnings from outbreak responses.",

The same can be said for the viruses of the genus Marburgvirus (along with ebolaviruses, members of the family Filoviridae): Marburg and Ravn. In addition, other viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, such as Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, Guanarito, and Crimean-Congo, would be expected to produce disease that, although potentially variable in presentation, would also require meticulous attention to personal protection and infection control guidance. In addition to the viral hemorrhagic fevers, several other human diseases are known to be highly infectious, highly contagious, and highly hazardous. As such, patients harboring these diseases are considered to be candidates for care in biocontainment units. Included among these are a group of severe acute respiratory diseases thought capable of transmission via droplet nuclei (and thus requiring airborne precautions), namely severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and certain novel, avian, and prepandemic strains of influenza.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health developed a hierarchy of controls designed to prevent injury and illness in the workplace (Fig. 2) . The hierarchy can be used to guide the development of protocols aimed at protecting health care workers from occupational hazards and exposure. It suggests a ranking of effectiveness with elimination and substitution described as the most effective because they direct removal or replacement of the hazard. This is followed by engineering controls, to isolate people from the hazard, and administration controls, which change the way people work through training or protocol development. PPE is at the bottom of the hierarchy and described as the least effective control. This is not because PPE is ineffective but as a control measure it means the hazard has not been eliminated or replaced, and protection is required. 10 PPE guidelines have been in place in the realm of health careassociated infection and isolation care with little modification for over a decade. 11 Despite this guidance, the lack of standards for design and performance of gowns in particular came to light after the experience of treating patients with EVD in 2014. 12 The Nebraska Biocontainment Unit has described the protocols used for protection of health care workers for EVD care in the literature. 13 The initial standards and procedures set by the hospitals that cared for patients with Ebola in the United States eventually became a guidance resource for managing patients with EVD worldwide. 14 ",

Because EVD cases were occurring in West Africa in 2014, travel screening was initiated at designated international airports with follow-up from the local public health department for active monitoring of fever or other symptoms. 15 Travel screening was also implemented at health care facilities across the country because an ill patient might present for medical care through the emergency department, ambulatory clinic, or other point of entry to a health care facility. 16 Quick front desk assessment was encouraged to include travel history, travel location, timeframe, and symptoms. This action allowed prompt identification and isolation when appropriate until further discernment could be made to drive laboratory testing decisions. Integrating this strategy into the electronic health record hard wired the process and alerted other caregivers if travel and symptom screening triggered an alert. Creation of consistent work flow and process tools for use by caregivers at all entry areas allowed for consistency in whom to contact, the type of isolation needed, the location of PPE, and various other duties or actions to take (Fig. 3) .",

Ebola assessment hospitals are expected to care for patients under investigation until a diagnosis can be confirmed or ruled out. If confirmed, a patient would be transferred to a regional or state designated Ebola treatment center, which is expected to provide care for the duration of the patient's illness. 15 Laboratory resources are a critical element of both a recognition and management plan for patients with EVD. Public health laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network are authorized to perform the molecular screening test for EVD. 17 Risk assessment is a critical element of developing a laboratory plan for EVD testing, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories has developed a template for this process. 18 Laboratories use a combination of point-of-care testing and compact analyzers that fit into a biosafety cabinet, as well as large automated closed-tube analyzers in core testing facilities. 19 When preparing a laboratory to support the care of patients with EVD, a specialized and trained team should be assembled, and a safe space identified to perform the testing. A test menu should be established. The laboratory team should train together and use a buddy system to maintain safety while performing testing. The laboratorians should practice routine skills and run laboratory test controls in the space designated for EVD testing to develop muscle memory for the different skills and clinical challenges that they will face when working with specimens in PPE that is not used in everyday practice. Practicing these skills allows for problemsolving for unique challenges. Successful clinical management of a patient under investigation or a confirmed patient with EVD will depend on a collaborative and connected relationship between the physician team, the nursing team, and the clinical laboratorians, with a strong connection to public health laboratories throughout the process.",

After the 2014 to 2016 EVD outbreak, federal funding became available to advance preparedness to respond to and effectively manage EVD or other infectious pathogens. One of the requests for all states was to create a concept of operations (CONOPs) to include, at a minimum, a plan to coordinate air or ground transport within the state and region. Direction, control, and coordination are described in detail to guide an event response. Anticipated key participating agencies must agree to the process that is outlined. These plans should also specifically discuss financing and how the plan itself is maintained through training and exercises. A critical element in preparedness planning includes exercising the plan to allow for refinement and ensuring the operational capability of a written plan. Forming a training and exercise planning committee can provide a venue to increase engagement across all partners and further develop working relationships among key partners. During the activation of a regional network, some transports may require multiple care teams and, therefore, exchanges of team members, as well as refueling for successful extended ground transports. Extended ground transports should be defined by the designated EMS transport service and the state health department in the state's CONOPs. Consideration should be given to the condition of the patient, the length of time staff can remain in PPE, and the distance the EMS vehicle can travel before needing to refuel. This type of coordinated trip requires advance planning and creative thinking to identify safe locations to perform these tasks. Many regions are exercising their regional plans and working through these challenges. These types of exercises to advance regional planning focus on the communication processes, patient care handoffs and the importance of the connection between EMS and nursing. Clinical updates during the transport and at the point of transition are critical to continuous quality care of the patient.",

            "text": "The decision to transport a patient with EVD is difficult. The risk involved in caring for the patient increases on leaving the relative safety of a controlled clinical care environment in a hospital setting for the fluid, less stable setting of ground or air transportation vehicles. As such, transportation may require clinical management that operates under altered standards of care. As a precaution for any potential generation of aerosols that may affect the driver during ground transport, air handling in the transport vehicle is set to prevent the circulation of air, with the ventilation fan put on high in the driver's compartment to establish a positive-pressure environment. 20 Decisions on the amount of barrier protection required for a ground vehicle transport and for the preparation of the patient should be made well in advance. Some teams use 6-mil plastic sheeting to create these barriers in the patient care area, 19 whereas others have identified prefabricated enclosures or have purchased purpose-built ambulances. If barriers are used, materials will add to the waste burden on arrival to the destination. Cooperative patients may tolerate an impervious suit and mask, whereas others may be unresponsive or unable to adequately control bodily fluids and require a more reliable containment device or wrap. 20 Many of these same challenges exist in the aircraft environment, with additional concerns related to the safety regulations for flight. Limitations exist on the type of chemical disinfectants that can be used so as not to compromise airworthiness (eg, not deteriorate aircraft components), and materials for restraint, such as seat belts or airline seats, are difficult to decontaminate. Moreover, certain electronic equipment routinely used in a ground vehicle or hospital environment may be prohibited on an aircraft due to interference of wireless services. Also, medical equipment must be deemed safe-to-fly by the appropriate authority. Guidance is available on many of these issues specific to the air medical transport of patients with EVD. 21 The high-risk nature of such transports demands clear lines of communication between transport teams and referring and receiving facilities, including frequent, accurate updates by transporting EMS teams on clinical status. Communicating the estimated time of arrival and patient information helps to establish receiving teams' expectations to facilitate timely, successful patient transitions. On arrival at the receiving hospital, a team of isolation unit staff, wearing appropriate PPE and trained in decontamination protocols, should meet the ground transport vehicle. Any fluid spills should be immediately decontaminated, followed by a full decontamination of the intrafacility route on patient placement. The full decontamination process is performed for community reassurance, especially in situations in which the transport occurs in public spaces.",

Protocols are refined based on feedback from the staff, which promotes ownership of the plans.

Each shift included at least 3 registered nurses. If the patient was in need of respiratory care, an RT was also present. Each staff member was assigned a staffing role at the beginning of each shift with specific tasks and everyone rotated through the roles, remaining within their scope of practice. The 3 registered nurses assigned to patient care worked directly at the patient's bedside in 4-hour shifts.
