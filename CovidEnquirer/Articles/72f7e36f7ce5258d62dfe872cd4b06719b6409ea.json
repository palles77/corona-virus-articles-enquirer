This high rate is in accordance with other studies, where dual and multiple infections varied from 5% to 20% of all viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). [10] [11] Coinfections were more common among children (majority \u2264 1 year of age) than adults, and were detected most often associated with IAV than H1N1 2009. Other studies also report high rates of multiple infections in young children, mostly in children aged less than 12 months, 12 and hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection. [13] [14] Among respiratory viruses tested in this study, AdV was the most commonly coinfecting virus with influenza A. Some studies reported high rates of coinfections with AdV. Tiveljung-Lindell et al. 15 observed dual infection with AdV in 16.2%, and Calvo et al. 16 found coinfection in 78.6% of AdV infections.",

Our findings do not allow the conclusion of greater severity of coinfected cases. Papadopoulos et al. 17 reported that coinfections were associated with increased disease severity, but other studies do not support this observation. In the majority of studies, coinfections do not show clinical differences compared to single infection neither in hospitalized 18 nor in outpatient children. 10 Establishing the relevance of coinfections is difficult. Some interpretations include concomitant infections, sequential infections, or long term, post-infection viruses. 19 The development of quantitative PCR, as well as its correlation with the clinical characteristics, may become a useful tool to clarify the role of coinfections.",

At least one viral agent was identified in 104/159 samples (65.4%). Influenza A was the most frequently detected agent, followed by rhinovirus, human metapmeunovirus, adenovirus, H R S V a n d H C o V . N o i n f e c t i o n s w i t h i n f l u e n z a B were detected. Coinfections were observed in 15 cases as previously published.9 Among the 15 coinfections, there were 9 cases of influenza A coinfected with other viruses and were analyzed in this study.Influenza A infection was detected in 41/159 (25.8%) patients, 29/159 specimens (18.2%) were positive for H1N1 2009, and 12/159 (7.6 %) were positive for seasonal IAV. Viral coinfections with influenza A were detected in 9/41 (21.9%) patients, being 26% (6/23) in children and 16.7% (3/18) in adults, a difference not significant (p = 0.47; OR 1.77; 95% CI 0.37-8.31). Coinfection with other viruses was present in 4/29 (13.8%) H1N1 2009 cases and in 5/12 (41.7%) seasonal IAV cases, a difference statistically significant (p = 0.049). The risk of coinfection among IAV cases was four times higher although not statistically significant. The nine cases of multiple infections were: three seasonal IAV plus AdV, one seasonal IAV plus HRV, two H1N1 2009 plus HRSV, two H1N1 2009 plus hMPV, and one triple infection of seasonal IAV plus HRV plus AdV.We analyzed the medical records of six coinfected patients and 27 patients monoinfected of the 41 positive patients for influenza A. 23 of the 41 positive patients were children (median age 4.7 years) and 18 were adults (median age 31.1 years), as shown onTable 1.Two deaths were related to H1N1 2009 and no coinfection was observed in this group. Three expecting mothers were among the H1N1 2009 positive patients and one of them had a coinfection with HRSV. No deaths occurred in this group.All patients had fever (\u2265 38\u00baC), 65% cough, 24.4% coryza, 9.7% dyspneia, 2.4% headache, and 12.2% of the",
