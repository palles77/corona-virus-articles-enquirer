Unlike the other CBF3 components, Skp1p is a highly conserved protein found in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, Skp1p has recently been shown to be a component of a cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complex purified from transformed human fibroblasts and to interact directly with Cdc4p and cyclin F through a novel structural motif (Bai et al., 1996 [this issue of Cell]).
