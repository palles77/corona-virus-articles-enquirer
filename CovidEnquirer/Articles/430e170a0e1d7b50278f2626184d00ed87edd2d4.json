            "text": "The template-dependent polynucleotide polymerases (TDPPs) that replicate cellular and viral genomes are central to life. The DNA genomes of cellular organisms and the majority of DNA viruses are replicated by DNA-dependent DNA polymerases (DdDp). RNA genomes, currently found only in viruses, comprise four types: positive and negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA \u00fe and ssRNA 2 , respectively) viruses, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and RNA viruses that use reverse transcriptase for genome replication. RNA-dependent polymerase is the only enzyme universally conserved in all of the thousands of known non-satellite RNA viruses. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is used to replicate the genomes of viruses with no DNA stage, and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp; reverse transcriptase) is used by viruses with a DNA stage in the life cycle. 1 Despite the diversity of genomes that they replicate, the TDPPs have remarkable structural conservation. All the RNA-dependent polymerases, and many DNA-dependent polymerases, employ a fold whose organization has been likened to the shape of a cupped right hand with three subdomains, termed fingers, palm and thumb. 2 Only the palm subdomain, composed of a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet with two a-helices packed beneath, is well conserved among all of these enzymes. 3 -9 The palm subdomain comprises several ordered sequence motifs, with motifs A, B and C 10 being the most prominent. Motifs A and C are conserved in the TDPPs of all cellular organisms and viruses. 5,11 -13 In RdRps, motif A (DX 4 -5 D, where X is a non-conserved residue) contains two Asp residues separated by four or five residues, while motif C (GDD) contains an Asp-Asp dipeptide, which is often preceded by a Gly. 10 In TDPPs other than RdRps, only the N-terminal Asp residues in motifs A and C are conserved 14 at the end of a b-strand of motif A and in the turn of the b^b hairpin of motif C. These Asp residues are spatially juxtaposed, bind divalent cations, Mg 2\u00fe and/or Mn 2\u00fe , and are crucial for catalysis. Motif B forms a long a-helix and is conserved in RNA-dependent polymerases, and, at the secondary structure level, in other polymerases. 4, 6 Motif B contains a residue (Asn in RdRp) that contributes to the discrimination between dNTPs and NTPs and thus determines whether RNA or DNA is synthesized. 6, 15 Hence, all three motifs are indispensable for proper functioning of polymerases. This structural and functional conservation implies that palm subdomains of all TDPPs may have evolved from a common and ancient ancestor. RdRps also share the palm motif D (a^b structure), and motif E (b^b structure), which is located at the palm -thumb interface; these motifs may not be readily recognized in sequences of every RNA virus.",

            "text": "Due to their universal occurrence and exceptional conservation, 16 -18 RdRps, along with a few other replicative proteins, have been used for the identification and classification of RNA viruses. The phylogeny of RdRps mainly parallels the taxonomy of RNA viruses up to the supergroup level. 19 Among ssRNA \u00fe viruses, Alphavirus and Picornavirus-like supergroups 20,21 are the most numerous, each comprising a dozen or so families. 22 Here, we describe the analysis of the replicases of four RNA viruses from two families. Recently ) are ssRNA \u00fe viruses provisionally classified as tetraviruses, an Alphavirus-like supergroup family whose members have only been isolated from lepidopteran insects. The second virus family is the dsRNA birnaviruses, including infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) that cause highly contagious diseases of young salmonid fish and chickens, respectively. 24, 25 The genomes of TaV and EeV consist of an RNA segment of , 5700 nucleotides (nt) with two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the putative replicase (see below) and capsid proteins. The capsid precursor is expressed from a subgenomic RNA molecule which, along with genomic RNA, is packaged into virions ( Figure 1 Figure 1 ). Counterparts of motifs A, B, and C of the palm subdomain and motif E, 10 were tentatively identified in the birnavirus RdRps through comparison with homologs encoded by ssRNA \u00fe viruses. 27, 28 However, the highly conserved Asp-Asp dipeptide, which is critical for enzymatic activity, was not evident in motif C of the IPNV RdRp. 28 This is in striking contradiction to the replicative competence of birnaviruses. 29, 30 Here we resolve the above conflict, showing that the originally identified motif C in birnaviruses is fortuitous; in fact, a well-conserved motif C is present, but located upstream of motif A in RdRps of birnaviruses as well as TaV and EeV. This organization of the C -A -B motifs is unprecedented amongst viral and cellular TDPPs and yields a palm fold in which the canonical structural elements show a non-canonical connectivity. Our findings further indicate that the RdRps of TaV, EeV and birnaviruses have profoundly deviated from all known RdRps and comprise a unique ancient lineage whose very existence affects our understanding of the evolution of both polymerases and RNA viruses.",

The analyzed RdRps also contain a newly recognized motif, termed G (T/SX 1 -2 G) (Figures 3 and  4) , that is the most conserved sequence in RdRps of TaV, EeV, and birnaviruses ( Figure 3(a) ). In the RHDV RdRp, the G motif occupies a part of the finger subdomain and is flanked by two Lys residues (Lys114 and Lys134) that were predicted to interact with the phosphodiester backbone of the primer in the primer-template duplex. 9 One or two conserved basic residues can also be found in the vicinity of the G motif of other viruses listed in Figure 4 (data not shown).

Accordingly, this region was termed fortuitous C motif (fC; Figure 3 (a) and (b)). Motif D (no consensus) was similarly not found. Surprisingly, a block with the expected properties for motif C is present immediately upstream of motif A in the replicases of TaV/EeV/birnaviruses (C? in Figure 3 and C in Figure 4 ). It includes a GDD (TaV and EeV) or structurally similar ADN tripeptide (infectious pancreatic necrosis virus strain Jasper (IPNVJ) and IBDV), and might therefore be the authentic motif C occupying a non-canonical position in the sequence of these RdRps.

To verify this permutation, we have applied a specially designed computer-assisted protocol that utilizes capabilities of sensitive HMMER and rps-BLAST programs for analyzing artificially permuted sequences. Using this protocol, it was shown that the relocation of the motif C? into the canonical position specifically and selectively converts noncanonical RdRps of the TaV/EeV and IPNV/IBDV lineages into the quasi-canonical RdRps (Figure 4 ; for details see Materials and Methods and Figures  8 and 9 ).

To address this question, the connectivity of the tertiary structure of the PV RdRp, 6 a typical palm-based polymerase belonging to the PF00608 family, was modified to model the permuted C -A -B motif sequence arrangement. To relocate motif C upstream of motif A, the PV structure had to be cut in three loops between the following pairs of elements: aD and b1, aH and b2, b3 and aI. For the permuted structure, three new connections between the following pairs: aD and b2, b3 and b1, and aH and aI, respectively, had to be formed ( Figure 5 (a) and (b)). All connections affected by this permutation are confined to a restricted loop area opposite the active site where the conserved catalytic aspartate residues (D233 and D328) are positioned ( Figure  5 (b)). Three new connections could be modeled without major steric clashes, and the Ca -Ca distances between the termini of the major secondary structural elements in the actual and artificially permuted structures, 9.58-14.27 \u00c5 and 4.26 -10.40 \u00c5 , respectively, are in similar ranges ( Figure  5 (b) and (c)). Thus, the permuted backbone connectivity is compatible with the spatial organization of the major secondary structure elements of the palm fold and could maintain structural integrity of the subdomain, as was observed for circularly permuted proteins. 36, 38 This rearrangement transforms the ferredoxinlike b1aHb2b3aIb4 fold of the palm subdomain, containing an insertion between b1 and aH elements, into a new b2b3b1aHaIb4 structure ( Figure 5(a) ). In this structure, the antiparallel b-sheet of the original fold is partly freed from the covalent linkage to the aH and aI elements, which, in turn, become directly covalently linked, and the b2^b3 hairpin and b1 strand, carrying the principal catalytic Asp residues, are brought into intimate sequential proximity. Similar structural alterations are predicted for the naturally permuted RdRps of TaV, EeV and birnaviruses. They may result in unique structural properties (e.g. intra-and inter-domain mobility) of the palm subdomain that may affect, for instance, the interconversion of open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations of the RdRp active site 9 and, ultimately, functioning of these RdRps.",

It was found that the quasi-canonical RdRps comprise a separate, deeply rooted lineage supported by 953 out of 1000 and 78 out of 100 bootstrap trials in the neighbor-joining and parsimonious analyses, respectively ( Figure 6 and data not shown).

Nt and Ct, N and C terminus, respectively. (b) Permutation of the palm fold of the PV RdRp. Using the Modeller suit of the Insight II package, the permutation found in the TaV/EeV/birnavirus RdRps was modeled onto the PV RdRp by relocation of the H320-E337 18 aa peptide into between E226 and E227 residues. To accommodate this re-organization, three additional mutations were introduced using loops from other proteins as templates: the foreign KVD tripeptide was inserted upstream of the 18 aa peptide and two point mutations P335 ! G and E337 ! P were engineered. The modeled regions were then improved using the Whatif4.99 package.

This domain reshuffling involved changes of the backbone connectivity in three loops rather than one loop and two terminal regions. 40 -42 A complex protocol of sequence comparisons was introduced (see Materials and Methods) to uncover these unprecedented permutations, which must be self-evident in the tertiary structures, which are not currently available. Due to a large evolutionary distance between the permuted and canonical RdRps, the three positions that delimit two adjacent permuted subsequences in each replicase have been identified with small margins which are expected to decrease when more related replicases could be analyzed. Work is in progress (B.T.L. & A.E.G., unpublished results) to extend our approach to the identification of internal permutations in other structurally uncharacterized proteins in sequence databases that should clarify the extent of the contribution of this type of permutation to protein evolution.",

Contrary to the current capsid-based classification of TaV, 23 and the closely related EeV, within the Tetraviridae family, the replicases of TaV and EeV proved to be significantly different in the domain organization and overall similarity from those of the known tetraviruses HaSV and NbV (Figures 1 and 2) . These two groups of viruses therefore employ very different replicative machineries that have diverged relatively early in evolution. With their shared capsid architecture and divergent replicases, TaV/ EeV and the well-established tetraviruses enjoy a mosaic relationship (Figure 1 ) resembling that between Picornavirus-like potyviruses and Alphavirus-like potexviruses. 43 On the basis of this parallel and the phylogeny of RdRps (Figure 6 ), we suggest to re-examine the taxonomic position of TaV and EeV with regard to the Tetraviridae. These viruses may be prototypes for a new family distinct from tetraviruses and not belonging to any existing virus supergroup. A formal proposal to make these changes is to be submitted to the International Virus Taxonomy The discovery of a distantly related group of permuted replicases in birnaviruses was also very surprising, since other replicases from true ssRNA \u00fe and dsRNA viruses are not interleaved. 19 The clustering of TaV/EeV and birnaviruses indicates that these viruses may share important characteristics of RNA synthesis not common to their respective classmates that are involved in contrasting, i.e. virion-independent and dependent, respectively, modes of replication. 44 The unique, intermediate position of birnaviruses between other dsRNA and ssRNA\u00fe viruses was also evident with other virus properties. 45 The observed replicase conservation covers approximately 550 aa and includes the RdRp domain, which is flanked by other uncharacterized domains. It may be relevant to this conservation that the genomic RNAs of viruses of these two groups have unique 3 0 -ends 24,23 which do not have the poly(A) or tRNA-like structures common in many other ssRNA \u00fe and dsRNA viruses. 46 The 3 0 -end is crucial for the initiation of minus RNA synthesis in RNA viruses. 47 In birnaviruses, a fraction of replicase molecules are known to be covalently linked to the 5 0 -end of genomic RNAs; these molecules are likely to be used to prime RNA synthesis. 24 The 5 0 -ends of the TaV/EeV genomic RNAs, which remain to be characterized, might also have a similar structure.",

Amino acid (aa) sequence alignments were generated using ClustalX1.81 58 and Dialign2 59 programs assisted by Blosum position-specific matrices, 60 and were processed for presentation using GeneDoc. 61 An alignment of the RdRps from 58 viruses, representing 13 ssRNA \u00fe virus families and groups of the Picornavirus-like supergroup and Nidovirales, was termed 58RdRp. Protein alignments were sent as input for the Jpred server to generate consensus prediction of secondary structures over several methods. 62, 63 Secondary structures were also predicted using a single sequence as input for the PSIPRED server. 64, 65 Multiple sequence alignments were converted into Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles using HMMER2.01 software 33 or used to build profiles using the Profileweight program. 66 Sequence databases were searched in default mode, unless otherwise stated, using the HMMER2.01 package 33, 37 and a family of Blast programs. 67 The expectation values of similarity (E) of 0.05 or lower for Blast searches and 0.1 or lower for HMMER-mediated searches were considered to be statistically significant. 68 The Profileweight profiles were compared in pairs by sliding a window of a selected length along each possible register, and matches above a threshold were recorded using the Proplot program. 66 The Plotsimilarity routine of the GCG-Wisconsin package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, USA) was used to visualize the conservation in sequence alignments. Cluster phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm of Saitou & Nei 69 with the Kimura correction 70 and were evaluated with 1000 bootstrap trials, as implemented in the ClustalX1.81 program. Parsimonious trees were generated using heuristic search and evaluated with bootstrap analysis using a UNIX version of the PAUP p 4.0.0d55 program 71 that is included in the GCG-Wisconsin Package programs. The resulting trees were visualized using the TreeView program. 72 Protein modeling and structure visualization were performed using Insight II (Accelrys Inc.) and Whatif4.99 packages. 73 Computational analysis of sequence permutations: approach and application to TaV/EeV and IPNVJ/ IBDV To identify and validate sequence permutations, a multi-step protocol was introduced that is briefly described below along with results of its application to replicases of RNA viruses. The identification of a genuine sequence permutation is straightforward, provided an analyzed sequence returns non-linear, permuted matches with other, canonical homologs upon scanning a sequence database using Blast or other search engine. 42 None of these conditions were apparent upon analysis of replicases of TaV, EeV and birnaviruses that differ from the canonical homologs through a permutation of a short internal sub-sequence and profound divergence elsewhere. To meet the challenge of identifying permutations of this complexity, we decided to analyze large spaces of the computer-generated replicase permutants using HMMER2.01 33 and rps-BLASTmediated 67 database searches. We made use of an observation that alignment with a highest score between permuted and canonical homologs is produced when permutation is reversed. 40, 42, 74 In other words, if two protein families have diverged through permutation of a sub-sequence in the ancestor of one of two families, then back-permutation in the proteins of the affected family produces sequences that outscore the parental sequences upon comparison with the other protein family. It is reasonable to assume further that this backpermutation must also outscore any other possible permutations as they, at the best, can only approach the similarity between the back-permutant and the other protein family.",

This reduces the number of permuted sequences that are generated by a factor of approximately S 3 . The stride length, S, should be odd so that unique sequences could be easily generated in the second step (see below), and, in practice, a stride length of 9 aa that is significantly smaller than sizes of expected permutations was used. Using this stride, from 2.6 \u00a3 10 5 to 6.9 \u00a3 10 5 shuffled sequences were generated from replicases of TaV/EeV and IPNVJ/IBDV.

The ratio of the HMMER E-values for the original (E o ) versus shuffled (E s ) sequences was used to rank the permutations in descending order.

This test included rps-Blast-mediated 67 comparisons of the pair of sequences with the ABCC in-house copy of a CD-database curated at the NCBI, 57 and results were plotted for each virus. The rps-Blast E-values were converted into the negative logarithm scores (2ln E) with the (E \u00bc 0.05) threshold being 1.3. Unlike the respective parents, the quasi-canonical replicases of EeV, TaV and IBDV reached a statistically sound level of similarity with a profile of RdRps from Picornavirus-like viruses (Pfam database accession number PF00608 37 ) (Figure 9 , compare the PF00608 scores projected on the 2ln E s versus 2 ln E o axes in the EeV, TaV and IBDV plots). The relocation of motif C? of the IPNVJ replicase also increased the already statistically significant similarity of the parental replicase and the PF00608 profile by five orders of magnitude (Figure 9 , compare the PF00608 scores projected on the 2ln E s versus 2 ln E o in the IPNVJ plot). Although shuffling also increased the similarity of the replicases with some other protein families from a pool of approximately 3500 profiles (Figure 9 and data not shown), these effects were statistically insignificant and could be stochastic in origin. It is worth noting that the profile database contains, in addition to the PF00608 family, several other RdRp families (e.g. PF00946, PF00972, PF00978, PF00998, PF02123) that were not significantly similar to the quasicanonical replicases, indicating that the observed increase in similarity was very specific.",

Distributions of maximum similarity scores for comparison of the original and shuffled replicases of four viruses with known protein families. The original replicase sequences and topscoring permutants (see Figure 8 ) of TaV, EeV, IPNVJ, and IBDV were used to scan a CD-database containing ,3500 entries using rps-Blast. 67 The 2 ln E scores for similarities of each profile with a pair of the original (abscisa) and shuffled (ordinate) sequences were recorded in the quadrant plots labeled according to virus. The intersection of the axes was set at the 1.3 score. Low-left quadrant, statistically insignificant hits of the original and shuffled sequences; upper-left quadrant, statistically insignificant hits of the original sequence and statistically significant hits of the shuffled sequence; upper-right quadrant, statistically significant hits of the original and shuffled sequences; lower-right quadrant, statistically significant hits of the original sequences and statistically insignificant hits of the shuffled sequences. The magnitude of effect of shuffling on the similarity between a replicase and a profile is estimated by the deviation of the hits' position from the imaginary 458 diagonal running through the intersection of the axes. The position of the PF00680 profile hit is highlighted and projected to the axes for each virus.",

Using an extended, gap-free version of the Figure 3 alignment, an unrooted neighbor-joining tree was inferred by the ClustalX1.81 program. All bifurcations with support in .700 out of 1000 bootstraps are indicated. A similar tree topology was inferred from analysis of the 328 parsimonious informative characters of the alignment using an heuristic search and parsimonious criterion (not shown). Different groups of viruses are highlighted. Only selected picornaviruses that do not include PV and HPeV1 employ a 2A protein (X) of the NPGP family. For the virus names, see the legend to Figure 4.",

Distributions of the sum of E o /E s scores for each pair of viruses that are associated with the positions of the origin (I; green) and destination (L; ochre) of permutations in respective alignments, and the highest scores for all sizes of relocated sub-sequences (I -J; insets) were plotted.
