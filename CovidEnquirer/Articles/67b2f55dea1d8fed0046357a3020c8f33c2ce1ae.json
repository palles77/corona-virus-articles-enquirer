            "text": "The innate immune system is attracting interest, not only because of its action in the immediate defence against infections, but also because of its importance for activating an adequate specific immune response. A number of different molecules are involved in recognizing the foreign agents through structures displayed on their surface, the socalled pathogen associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. The recognition molecules may be cell-associated receptors (pathogen recognizing receptors, PRPs) or soluble pathogen recognizing molecules (PRMs). The latter group includes the collectins, among which mannan-binding lectin (MBL) attracts especial interest due to its ability to bind to microorganisms (Jack and Turner, 2003) leading to activation of the complement system. In blood, MBL is associated with MBLassociated serine proteases (MASPs). All the functions of the MASPs are not known although it is clear that MASP-2 is the enzyme of the MBL/MASP complex needed for activation of complement factor C4 (Thiel et al., 1997) . Lately, it has been found that another group of PRMs, the ficolins, may activate the enzymatic cascade of complement using the same MASPs as MBL. While the involvement of MBL in the defence system has been studied extensively, little is presently known about the function of the ficolins. For a more detailed presentation of these proteins, see Holmskov et al. (2003) .",

At birth, the level is about 2/3 of adult level, which is reached in a month, and there is a minor decline in old age . There is a small increase in connection with acute phase responses (Thiel et al., 1992) . This increase is slow (1-2 weeks after the inducing event), and modest (up to threefold increase) compared to the 1000-fold genetically based increase and has unfortunately led to promoting MBL as an acute phase protein, which indeed is formally right. However, we would rather focus on MBL as a protein present when needed and capable of immediate action.",

Exon 1 harbours three missense SNPs giving rise to amino acid exchanges in the first part of the collagenous region. Two of these (Gly54Asp, named \"B\" and Gly57Glu, \"C\") exchange glycine with an acetic amino acid. The third (Arg52Cys, \"D\") introduces a cysteine in the collagen region (the residue numbers includes the leader sequence of 20 residues). The wild type is denoted \"A\". The three variant structural alleles are associated with decreased MBL levels. The promoter region shows a number of SNPs as well, some of which influences the expression of MBL. Here we address only the polymorphisms at \u2212550 (termed H/L), \u2212221 (termed Y/X) and \u221266 (termed P/Q). Due to linkage disequilibrium only seven haplotypes are found; HYPA, LYPA, LYQA, LXPA, HYPD, LYPB and LYQC, giving a total of 28 possible genotypes (e.g., the MBL deficient genotype: LXPA/LYPB). Individuals homozygous for A show MBL levels above 1 g/ml, except some of those homozygous for LXPA. Heterozygous people with A on one gene and B, C or D on the other mostly have MBL levels between 0.5 and 1 g/ml, while those with variant structural allotypes on both genes (genotypes often denoted 0/0) show MBL levels below 50 ng/ml.

            "text": "As noted above, assays using mannan coats and development with anti-MBL antibodies estimate MBL as lectin and thus represent a functional assay for the initial step in the activation of the MBL pathway. If one wishes to estimate the activity of the MBL/MASP complex, thus measuring the MBL pathway activity, one may simply carry out the incubation with the diluted serum sample at 37 \u2022 C, and develop with anti-C4 antibody to determine the amount of C4b bound to the surface. Surprisingly, it appears that at high serum dilution (100-fold) there is little or no activation via the classical pathway through bound anti-mannan antibodies (Super et al., 1990) . Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, we have chosen to take advantage of the observation that while the C1 complex is unstable at high ionic strength, the MBL/MASP complex stays intact. Thus, the sample, serum or plasma (high salt also abolishes coagulation), is diluted in a buffer containing 1 M NaCl and calcium. Following incubation in the mannancoated wells and wash, C4 is added, and deposited C4b is estimated after incubation at 37 \u2022 C. The results of this assay correlate (r = 0.96) with the assay for MBL as lectin or antigen (Thiel et al., 2002) , except in case of MASP-2 deficiency (Stengaard-Pedersen et al., 2003) . Recently, a kit for estimating the functional activity of the entire MBL pathway was made commercially available (Wieslab, Lund, Sweden) . This assay measures the amount of soluble membrane attack complex deposited on the mannan surface following incubation with serum at 37 \u2022 C, and is thus sensitive to defects in any component from MBL to C9. It may be noted that some prefer the term \"lectin pathway\" since L-and H-ficolin appears to function like MBL. However, L-ficolin is not a lectin but a molecule with indiscriminate activity towards acetyl groups (Krarup et al., 2004) .",

The chemotherapy period may thus be a unique situation for studying the role of MBL in the context of an iatrogenic immunodeficiency. Several studies have thus attempted to analyze the correlation between MBL deficiency and infections in such patients. It turns out to be fairly difficult to compare these studies due to a number of aspects: the studies include patients with a variety of underlying malignancies and thus different chemotherapy regimes have been used; some studies only examine MBL genotypes (and may in some cases disregard the strong influence of the promoter allotype, LXPA), while others use MBL levels; the outcome measures differ between the studies (duration of fever and neutropenia-serious infection (with some variation in definition)); different combinations of antimicrobial agents and G-CSF has been used at different centers; the study period differs; some are prospective, most are retrospective, which may present difficulties due to variability in journal keeping, e.g., registration of febrile episodes. What emerge is that the indication of increased infections in patients with low MBL levels seen in some studies seems absent or much less pronounced in patients with particular strong suppression of phagocytic activity due to intensive chemotherapy, as when preparing the patient for bone marrow transplantation, or caused by the specific leukemia, as for AML. We shall first describe some reports, which find clear evidence of the importance of MBL for protection in leukemia patients, and then turn to reports where such correlation was not found. Neth et al. (2001) examined 100 children receiving chemotherapy. MBL genotypes and MBL levels were correlated to the causes, frequency and duration of febrile neutropenic periods. The majority of children were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Children with variant MBL alleles exhibited twice as many days of febrile neutropenia as children with wild type genotypes (p = 0.014). Each episode of febrile neutropenia was also significantly longer in the group of children with variant genotypes. Analysis by MBL quantification supported this as children with less than 1 g MBL/ml had a higher number of days with febrile neutropenia (p = 0.012). No significant relationship was observed between frequency of infections, other measured clinical parameters and MBL genotypes. Peterslund et al. (2001) described 54 adults treated with chemotherapy for a range of hematological malignancies. Within 21 days after start of chemotherapy, 16 patients developed clinically significant infections defined as bacteremia, pneumonia or both. MBL levels, measured in plasma obtained before chemotherapy, were lower in these patients than in the ones without such infections (p < 0.0001). All patients with the infections, except one, showed MBL levels below 0.5 g/ml.",

(2005) conducted a prospective observational study focusing on assessment of MBL as a risk factor for infection during chemotherapyinduced neutropenia in adult hematological cancer patients. They included 255 patients and determined MBL levels as well as MBL genotypes. When analysis was performed on per patient basis a higher rate of severe infections was seen in MBL deficient patients (p = 0.008). The impact was further increased when excluding acute leukaemic patients. Focusing on bacteremia and excluding acute leukemia and bone marrow transplant patients, MBL deficiency was associated with a greater rate of bacteremia (p = 0.01). The association between low MBL and infections was independent of whether or not the patients received prophylactic antibiotics or GM-CSF. When focusing on AML patients alone there was no correlation between low MBL and infections. The authors did not see a difference in duration of febrile neutropenia for any of the groups. Bergmann et al. (2003) studied 80 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and determined MBL levels. They observed no influence of MBL levels on the frequency, severity or duration of fever, and suggested that the severe immunosuppression induced by the combination of the myeloid cancer and chemotherapy may obscure the normal effector functions of MBL.",

They used a relatively long (1 year and more for some patients) follow-up period and found the presence of the haplotype HYA (in cis with wild type on the other gene, i.e., genotype encoding higher MBL levels) to be associated with reduced risk of infection, especially in the period after neutrophil recovery. Surprisingly, such association was seen for both donor and recipient haplotypes. Thus, significantly more frequent infections were seen when donors carrying an MBL mutation were used (OR 4.1). There is no theory to explain the influence of donor MBL allotypes although it has been suggested that some MBL may be synthesized from the donor cells .",

These conditions present major challenges (indeed between 50 and 80% of all critically ill patients may be classified as having SIRS/sepsis) and a large number of studies have tried to identify risk markers. Hansen et al. (2003b) studied patients randomly assigned to either conventional treatment or intensive insulin therapy at an intensive care unit (ICU).

A study by Boniotto et al. (2002) encompassing 117 patients and 130 controls indicated an association between celiac disease and the presence of variant MBL alleles. Later the same group (Boniotto et al., in press) investigated 149 patients and 147 controls and found the frequency of homozygosity for variant MBL alleles to be higher in the patients (p = 0.035). The low MBL genotypes were strongly associated with more celiac disease symptoms (p = 0.001) as well with increased frequency of secondary autoimmune diseases (p = 0.01). By immunohistochemistry MBL was found to be present, together with apoptotic cells, in the basal lamina under the intestinal epithelium, where they had previously found mRNA for MBL (Boniotto et al., 2003) . This finding in Italy is supported from Finnish celiac disease patients. Iltanen et al. (2003) thus found association between the B allotype and MBL in a study of 88 celiac disease patients and 138 controls (p = 0.004). Boniotto et al. (in press) suggest that impaired removal of apoptotic cells due to MBL deficiency might predispose to the development of autoimmune symptoms. A recent paper now describes that mice lacking MBL exhibits less efficient removal of apoptotic cells (Stuart et al., 2005) . In vitro studies have previously implicated MBL in removal of apoptotic cells (Ogden et al., 2001; Nauta et al., 2004) . Another explanation could be that increased susceptibility to intestinal infections and diarrhea, associated with low MBL, may change the intestinal epithelia thus allowing for abnormal stimulation of anti-gliadin immune responses and triggering of the cascade leading to celiac disease.",

Their pathogenesis is unknown, but genetic as well as environmental factors, e.g., microorganisms, are implicated. Rector et al. (2001) examined MBL genotypes of 431 IBD patients (142 UC and 287 CD and 2 with indeterminate colitis) and compared this with 112 affected and 141 non-affected first-degree relatives and 308 healthy controls. The number of individuals with low MBL variant haplotypes was significantly lower in UC as compared to CD (p = 0.01) and to controls (p = 0.02), while no difference was found between CD and controls. It was suggested that MBL may be responsible for the more extensive complement-mediated mucosal damage in UC compared to CD and low MBL levels could thus protect somewhat against the development of the disease. Seibold et al. (2004) , conducting a smaller study, measured MBL levels in 74 CDs, 22 UCs and 32 healthy controls, and MBL genotyped 58 CDs, 18 UCs and 47 controls (excluding patients with active disease from the study). The frequency of homozygous and compound heterozygous for variant exon 1 alleles differed significantly between patients suffering from CD or UC and the healthy controls (p < 0.01). If only CD patients and controls were considered, the significance increased further (p = 0.005). Antibodies against mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are present in many patients with CD (this is a routine clinical parameter). In this study, 47% in the patients with CD and in 0% of the controls. It was found that more CD patients with anti-mannan antibodies had low MBL levels (p < 0.0001) as was also true when looking at T-cell proliferation in response to mannan (p < 0.0001). It would appear that the immune reactivity against mannan in CD is regulated by the MBL concentration.",

The vasculitis has a predilection for the coronary arteries and in the developed world Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children (Royle et al., 2005) . Based on the idea of MBL as an initiator of inflammation, Biezeveld et al. (2003) studied the frequency of MBL genotypes in 90 Dutch patients with Kawasaki disease. They found a higher frequency of MBL mutations as compared to the genotypes in 88 controls (p = 0.03). In children younger than 1 year, those with mutations were at higher risk of development of coronary artery lesions (OR 16, p = 0.026). Kawasaki disease occurs more frequent in oriental children (roughly 50/100,000, 10 times more frequent than in Caucasians) (Royle et al., 2005) . Studying Kawasaki disease among Hong Kong Chinese patients, Cheung et al. (2004) included 71 patients and 41 matched controls and determined MBL genotypes and MBL levels. They did not see a difference between the MBL genotypes of patients and controls. When analyzing for brachioradial arte-rial stiffness, which is an important cardiovascular risk factor in the children, they found this to be associated with low MBL genotypes (multiple linear regression analysis, p = 0.03), concluding that MBL genotypes may modulate the disease. The recent finding of an association between a novel human coronavirus and Kawasaki disease (Esper et al., 2005) may fit with the many indications of MBL having anti-viral activity.",

It has been proposed that MBL may bind to altered self components, which may possibly be found in diabetic patients, and MBL could thus be a potential pathogenic factor for diabetic cardiovascular complications, e.g., nephropathy (Hansen, 2005; Saevarsdottir et al., 2005) . Normoalbuminuric type 1 diabetics have been found to have higher MBL levels than non-diabetic controls, with a stepwise increase in circulating MBL levels with increasing levels of urinary albumin excretion (Hansen et al., 2003a) . No correlation between MBL and C-reactive protein levels (a generally used marker for inflammatory reactions) was seen. Another study showed that a significantly larger proportion of patients with diabetic nephropathy presented a MBL genotype associated with higher MBL level, when compared to the group with MBL genotypes associated with low MBL levels (OR = 1.52) . Saraheimo et al. (2005) confirmed the elevated serum MBL levels in type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy. In a prospective 18-years followup study on 270 type 1 diabetic patients, it was found that for patients with type 1 diabetes and MBL-levels below the median of 1.6 g/ml the risk of developing micro or macroalbuminuria was 26%, while the patients with MBL-levels above the median had a risk of 41% of developing microor macro-albuminuria (Hovind et al., 2005) . The data above suggest that a high MBL geno-and phenotype is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetic kidney disease and that assessing MBL status may prove beneficial in identifying patients at risk for micro-and macro-vascular complications.",

Phase I trials with rMBL have now been successfully concluded. While many of the MBL-deficiency-associated clinical conditions mentioned above would theoretically be candidates for reconstitution treatment, one must initially aim at investigating small defined patient groups with relatively short follow-up periods of immunodeficiency, such as selected patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or SIRS/sepsis patients (but obviously a better definition of the patients may be needed).

One would thus a priory expect significant manifestations of MBL deficiency. Accordingly, there is abundant evidence for association between susceptibility to infections and MBL deficiency. But this appears to surface only in certain clinical situations where other elements of the immune system are compromised. The immune defence is abundant, or redundant, and survival of the individual is ensured by manifold defence mechanisms. A more subtle, regulatory role of MBL is indicated by the prevalence of MBL deficiency in autoimmune disorders, suggesting new avenues of investigation.",
