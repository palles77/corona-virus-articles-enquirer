            "text": "Corporations and other large institutions have become deeply concerned with continuity of operations and the security of their personnel. The new urgency placed on these functions since Sept. 11, 2001 , has drawn attention to a substantial resource already in place in such organizations-their occupational health services. The imperatives of corporate security and homeland defense have, in turn, invigorated and expanded the mission of occupational medicine, one of the oldest recognized medical specialties. 1 Occupational health services are most familiar in the manufacturing sector and in the setting of a plant's medical clinic. Typically, such services include at least one occupational health nurse (also a professional specialization); an occupational physician (typically on contract); and support staff, all of whom report on a regular basis to a plant manager and are responsible professionally to a corporate medical director, who himself or herself serves as a traveling troubleshooter, in-house resource on health issues, and auditor for health affairs. This physician-led, health-centered team typically is engaged in regular interaction and troubleshooting in collaboration with an industrial hygienist and safety officer, who are usually oriented more toward process and plant operations, documenting regulatory compliance, and identifying and measuring health hazards. These hazardoriented professionals usually report to a different manager or directly to the plant manager. This basic pattern was once the norm in industry, but the dramatic reorganization in industry, management focus on core business, and the rise of the service sector have forged a new pattern, in which services are outsourced to contractors and consultants. 2 However, whichever pattern is followed in a particular enterprise, the following essentials are in place in most large operations: a means of monitoring the health of workers, a system for documenting their health, a system for documenting and evaluating hazards, a mechanism for responding to emergencies, and a panel of health consultants. 3 This is exactly the type of infrastructure that large organizations need so that they can respond to disasters and protect the security and continuity of operations. 4 Thus, large organizations already have in place a structure on which to build to protect their operations and personnel. Involvement of the occupational health service in emergency management, which was common in the past, is a natural extension into disaster medicine, involving training and preparation for consequence management and mitigation activities, 5 preparedness for a response indigenous to the physical plant, and planning for the management of risks inherent to the operation. 2, 6 The occupational health service also has an important place at the table as an active member of the healthcare team, interacting with local prehospital care providers and hospitals on the Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC).",

In time of crisis, the occupational physician may help get the community back on its feet by helping to keep an employer open or critical infrastructure functioning. 8 Similarly, the occupational physician has been called on to manage the corporate response to serious health-related issues, such as traveling to areas in which severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other emerging infections are a risk; rapidly investigating suspicious outbreaks of disease or exposure to potential hazards; and determining when re-entry and reoccupancy is possible in contaminated facilities, such as post office facilities contaminated with anthrax. 4 Several companies, including Cathay Pacific, participated in an informal monitoring network during the SARS epidemic to share observed trends and experience when the information they needed was not forthcoming from conventional sources.

It includes physicians, occupational health nurses, industrial hygienists, and other occupational health professionals. The OH-CG is a working council, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services, within what will eventually become a health-sector ISAC (Informational Sharing and Coordination) organization. This is a highly unusual and encouraging development in many respects. ISACs have official status with the Department of Homeland Security and are intended to coordinate the planning response of critical sectors of the American economy and society. They have been formed, for example, in industry sectors such as critical utilities and transportation. The OH-CG was the first health-sector ISAC to be created and is now the Occupational Health Subcommittee of the Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council, the ISAC for healthcare. This is a remarkable achievement for a relatively small medical specialty. Because occupational health is crosscutting across industries, the OH-CG is expected to serve as a resource for other critical sectors rather than to focus primarily on the health sector per se and in so doing uniquely relate to other ISACs as much as the one of which it is a part. Its mission is to provide occupational health professionals with what they need and when they need it in a time of crisis through channels that do not depend on any one mode of communication.",

On-site decontamination may have to be continued at the hospital or a second location away from the industrial incident. Surge capacity operations may be created away from the hospital under the direction of the LEPC, county emergency manager, or hospital. This may include separate healthcare mutual aid agreements specific for the incident and secondary triage and treatment provided by trained physicians and other healthcare providers through the use of vendor agreements or prepositioned equipment and supplies. This strategy will enable the hospital and community healthcare delivery system to operate at near-standard operations during an industrial incident. Any facility that has potable water, electricity, and shelter may participate. Pre-existing arrangements for accessing these sites should be spelled out under mutual aid agreements, vendor contracts, memoranda of understanding, or special circumstances agreements negotiated in advance between the county emergency management office, the hospital, or the local employer. Documentation of expenditures is a critical function, just as it is in the incident command structure, 9 to reimburse all nonvolunteers and contracts executed in the response.",

Some people in situations of perceived catastrophic risk behave irrationally, however, and demonstrate psychogenic symptoms and maladaptive behavior.

However, in times of crisis, survival of the enterprise and protection of people take precedence.
