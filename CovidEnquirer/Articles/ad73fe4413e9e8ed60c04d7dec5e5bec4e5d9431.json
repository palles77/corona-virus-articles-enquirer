Aim: The purpose of this study is to analyze the results of implementing the mini-CEX into the one-month postgraduate residency training in EM. Materials and methods: This study is a retrospective review of mini-CEXs completed by ED faculty members from August 2009 to December 2010. All PGY-1 residents enrolled in this study rotated through the one-month EM training. Each PGY-1 resident received one week of trauma training and three weeks of non-trauma training. The clinical competencies of each PGY-1 resident were evaluated with mini-CEXs, rated by a trauma surgeon and three emergency physicians (EPs). We analyzed the validity of weekly mini-CEX and the impact of seniority and specialty training of ED faculties on observation time, feedback time and rating scores. Results: Fifty-seven ED faculty members (42 EPs and 15 trauma surgeons) evaluated 183 PGY-1 residents during the 17 months of EM training. ED faculties with different specialty training provided similar assessment processes. Most competencies were rated significantly higher by trauma surgeons than by EPs. On the computerized mini-CEX rating, no data was missed and junior EPs rated all competencies significantly higher. The evaluators and PGY-1 residents were generally satisfied with the computerized format. As compared to the first assessment, only some competencies of PGY-1 residents were rated significantly higher in subsequent evaluations. Conclusion: The seniority and specialty training of ED faculty affected the mini-CEX ratings. The computer-based mini-CEX facilitated complete data gathering but showed differences for ED faculty with different levels of seniority. Further studies of the reliability and validity of the mini-CEX for PGY-1 EM training are needed.",

In order to improve the competency of junior resident physicians, the Department of Health authorized the Taiwan Joint Commission to develop the Postgraduate Primary Care Medical Training Program. Each postgraduate resident then received 3-months of general medicine training during residency from 2003 to 2006. The postgraduate Year 1 (PGY-1) general medicine training course was extended to 6 months from 2006 to 2011 and then extended to 1 year in July 2011. Residents must complete this training within 1 year after being accepted for specialty training. One month of emergency medicine training has been part of this program since July 2009. Chang Gung Memorial Hospital is a 3800 bed tertiary hospital in Taoyuan, Taiwan. The emergency department (ED) of the hospital provides the PGY-1 residency-training program and uses the mini-CEX as an assessment tool for clinical competence. As limited knowledge about the variations of assessment outcomes rated by different ED faculties using mini-CEX is understood, this study analyzed the results of implementation of the mini-CEX in the 1-month postgraduate residency training in EM. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, validity, and impact factors of the mini-CEX ratings in the ED setting.",

Each PGY-1 resident was evaluated with a mini-CEX weekly. In the first 12 months, paper-based mini-CEXs were rated by EPs and trauma surgeons. In the followed 5 months, the mini-CEXs rated by EPs were changed to a computer-based format. The satisfaction survey (9point scale) of evaluators and students was also available in the new format. We analyzed the validity of the weekly mini-CEX and the impact of seniority and the specialty training of ED faculty members on observation time, feedback time, and rating scores. We also explored the benefits of implementation of the computer-based mini-CEX format. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

There were no missing data after the implementation of the computer-based format over the next 5 months. The evaluators and PGY-1 residents were generally satisfied with the computerized mini-CEX format; their ratings ranged from 5 to 9 (7.3 AE 0.8 and 7.9 AE 0.8 respectively). Junior faculty were more satisfied with the format than were senior faculty (7.5 AE 0.8 and 6.9 AE 0.9 respectively, p < 0.001). On the computerized mini-CEX rating, junior EPs rated all competencies of PGY-1 residents significantly higher and senior faculty rated most of them lower ( Table 4 ). The scoring difference in each domain was larger for junior faculties than for senior faculties. In our analysis, junior faculty provided longer observation and feedback times than did senior faculty; however, that trend was not statistically significant.",

Torre et al 8, 9 showed that format and seniority were associated with rating outcomes on the mini-CEX. As this assessment tool is widely utilized in various clinical settings and is used to certify residents' clinical competence, a better and more standardized evaluation is crucial. Two randomized studies highlighted the value of rater training and its effect on scores 23, 24 ; however, it was likely to be ineffective if the training was too brief. 23e25 Most studies evaluating the mini-CEX focus on its educational impact as an assessment tool and on the perceptions of evaluators and trainees. 1, 6, 16, 19 We found no published studies looking at the effect of this assessment tool on doctors' performance in the ED. In our analysis, the seniority and specialty training of ED faculty showed differences in the mini-CEX rating for ED trainees. Moreover, the format of the mini-CEX also had an impact on ratings and was different for junior and senior ED faculty members. Rater training for the assessment process and familiarity with the impact of computer-based format on ratings was suggested as one way to promote educational interaction and to improve the quality of assessment for ED trainees.",

Our study was retrospective and the data were collected from computer and paper databases. Although we made every effort to remain objective, possible errors may have been introduced. 3. The computerized format was not utilized in the 1-week trauma-training curriculum so that the impact of these specialty raters on the mini-CEX ratings was limited to the paper-based format. 4. The domains of the computer-based mini-CEX were modified from the paper-based format. The clinical skills domain was replicated with Direct Observation of Procedural Skills and an overall domain was added to the computerized format. However, most of the core competencies were the same in both formats for analyzing the impact of format change on rating outcomes. 5. The analysis of the impact of seniority on ratings was limited to the EM faculty only because mini-CEX ratings by senior faculty (>10 years) among trauma surgeons were too few. 6. There was no satisfaction survey along with the paperbased mini-CEX so it was not possible to analyze the differences in satisfaction between the paper and computer-based formats. 7. The observation time of around 15 minutes was hardly sufficient to assess all seven parameters of mini-CEX for ED cases with moderate to high complexity. However, most cases treated by PGY-1 residents supervised by ED faculties were simple and in line with the goal of 1-month EM training curriculum.",
