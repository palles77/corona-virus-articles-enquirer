This association of influenza B with S. pyogenes infections can be attributed largely to the years 1997, 2001, 2007 and 2008, when late peaks in influenza B counts were followed by peaks in S. pyogenes notifications. This finding reinforces the case for universal immunization against influenza, as partial protection against the 'flesh eating disease'.",

This applies to seasonal 6, 12 and pandemic 10 influenza A, including the 2009 pH1N1 strain, 13 and to influenza B. 6 About 95% of deaths associated with influenza are considered to be caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia, the susceptibility to which is thought to peak 1-2 weeks after exposure to influenza. 11, 14 However, the peak may be later for pneumococcal infections, up to 4 weeks in adults and 8 weeks in children.

However, non-systematic deviations of the observations from the predicted pattern may be easier to associate with a particular cause. 18 Our goal in the present study was therefore twofold. First, to model the reported incidence of four invasive bacterial infections, those caused by S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis, as functions of earlier numbers of positive tests for influenza A and B. Second, in doing so, to represent as fully as possible seasonality and long-term trends in the reported incidences of bacterial infections by means of dedicated model terms, leaving only the remaining variance to be explained by earlier numbers of positive influenza tests.",

(ii) The large coefficient for sine1 reflects the yearly notification peaks, but there is also a weaker six-monthly (cosine2) and twomonthly (cosine6) periodicity. (iii) All the long-term-trend terms are highly significant. (iv) Influenza B counts for a given week (week 0) are associated with increases in S. pyogenes notifications in the same week and in the following one (weeks 0 and +1), of about 3.8% [(1.0376)1)*100] and 3.5% [(1.0354)1)*100] per additional positive influenza B test, respectively. They are also associated, although not statistically significantly, with decreases in S. pyogenes notifications in weeks +2 to +5. These two phenomena together are suggestive of 'harvesting' 31, 32 : at least some of the S. pyogenes infections following influenza B would have occurred even without influenza, but a few weeks later, having merely been brought forward in time by influenza B. However, a model containing influenza B counts for all 6 weeks does not show a better fit than one containing only the counts for weeks 0 and )1 (deviance = 6.96, P = 0.1381), indicating that this apparent 'harvesting' of cases may well be in fact random variations in the parameters. (Note that the N. meningitidis terms marked c and d in Table 1 , although large and almost significant, are in the wrong sequence for harvesting, which is why they are not reported as a finding.) The comparison of observed and expected S. pyogenes counts before and after influenza counts are added to the model (Figures 4 and 5) shows a visible improvement in fit. A comparison of the two dark lines shows that, with influenza B in the model, four transient increases in S. pyogenes infections are now modelled that were not before: those in 1997, 2001, 2007 and especially 2008. Looking back at the time series of influenza B counts (dark line in Figure 1 ), one notes that these were years with late, high peaks in the weekly numbers of influenza B-positive tests. An additional indication that this association may be causal is that the average age of known influenza B cases in these 4 years is significantly higher, 33.9 years, than in other years, 24.6 years (P < 0.000), and closer to the average ages of S. pyogenes cases, 45.9 years.",

Finally, because we tried to model all trends, secular or periodic, as much as possible through dedicated terms, the absence of significant effects of influenza A, or of effects on other bacterial infections than those because of S. pyogenes, does not mean such effects do not exist. These effects may simply be so similar in strength and timing to the overall effects modelled by periodic and spline terms that their contributions are entirely subsumed by these terms.",

Yet, its greater generalizability provides additional support for the recent recommendation to immunize all persons aged \u2021 6 months against influenza. 46 The ability of invasive S. pyogenes infections to cripple or kill previously healthy adults makes even partial protection against them an appreciable argument in the promotion of universal influenza vaccination.",

Weekly bacterial infection counts were roughly Poisson distributed, but variances being consistently larger than means justified the choice of negative binomial regression.The time series of influenza A and B counts (Figure 1) shows that type B varies proportionately more from year to year than type A and usually peaks some weeks later. The smoothed N. meningitidis and H. influenzae counts(Figure 2)show a seasonality that is irregular in period and amplitude; in addition, H. influenzae counts increased markedly between 2003 and 2004, when all invasive H. influenzae infections became reportable, not only those of type B. The smoothed S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes counts (Figure 3)show yearly peaks that are particularly marked for S. pneumoniae; however, the peaks are not synchronous, those for S. pyogenes tending to occur later in the year.",
