Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected whenever an elderly had symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI). PCR and RT-PCR were performed for influenza A/B, human parainfluenza virus 1-4, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, enterovirus, human coronavirus and human Bocavirus (HBoV). Array cards for atypical bacteria were also used in severe cases. Results: In total, 188 episodes of ARI were reported, being rhinovirus the most frequently detected (n = 53), followed by influenza A(H3) (n = 19) and HBoV (n = 14). Severe infections were reported in 19 patients, 11 of which were fatal, Legionela pneumophila, rhinovirus, HMPV and RSV associated with these fatalities. Nine influenza strains were analyzed, all antigenically dissimilar from vaccine strain 2013/14. \"Age\", \"HMPV\" and \"Respiratory disease\" showed an association with severe infection. Conclusions: In this study an etiologic agent could be found in 60% of the acute respiratory episodes. These data provides information about the circulating viruses in ECC and highlights the importance of searching both viruses and atypical bacteria in severe ARI.",

Results of chronic respiratory diseases and quality of life from this project have already been published (Carreiro-Martins et al., 2016) . The team involved was the same of a previous one that studied the health impact of indoor air environment in Children Day Care Centers (ENVIRH) (Ara\u00fajo-Martins et al., 2014; Paix\u00e3o et al.,2014) . Here, we aimed to study the viral role in ARI in residents of ECC of Lisbon, during the 2013/14 winter. In addition, in order to better clarify the role of the respiratory viruses in severe infections, atypical bacteria were also searched in a subset of patients.",

An additional monoplex assay specific for HBoV was also included in this study (Table 1) . Amplification and detection of PCR products were performed using the Rotorgene TM PCR system (Qiagen) acquiring the fluorescence on FAM, JOE, CY5, and ROX channels at each cycle. Samples and negative control (molecular grade water) were individually spiked with MS2 bacteriophage internal control (4,600 pfu per extraction) prior to nucleic acid extraction to identify any inhibitors. Positive controls for all panels were made from a combination of recombinant plasmids and from known positive specimens, diluted to give a cycle threshold value of 20-25.",

One of the strengths of this study was the relatively large sample size of elderly people. Eighteen of the 95 ECC registered in the Lisbon area (19% of the total ECC) agreed to participate, resulting in a total sample size of 1022 residents. Moreover, every resident who was able to answer the questionnaire was invited to participate in the survey. On the other hand, we could not interview many residents, as they were too disabled to participate in the study. For this reason, our sample is not entirely representative of the elderly who attended the ECC. 1  45  34  4  11  5  5  1  1  2  148  27  8  7  3  3  1  3  21  1  1  4  51  0  5  44  1  6  44  13  7  3  3  1  7  14  2  1  8  39  1  1  1  9  33  0  10  334  76  30  1  5  5  2  1  1  1  11  16  3  2  1  12  47  0  13  48  20  6  1  1  2 Another weakness of our study was the low staff compliance with the project for some of the ECC, despite an intensive campaign of information and contacts with them. In fact, four of them did not report a single event, which cannot be explained by the lower number of residents (ECC01 and ECC04 are good examples, with rates of 34/45 and 0/51, respectively). Therefore, any study or campaign including ECC should take into consideration the variability of staff compliance between centers, which can affect significantly the results obtained. One hundred and thirteen of 188 episodes of reported ARI were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Most of the respiratory viruses searched for in this project were detected, confirming the diversity on the aetiology of ARI in elderly patients. In fact, only adenovirus, enterovirus, and HPIVs types 2/4 were never detected in this study, which is in accordance with reports that suggest that these viruses are not frequently detected in this age group (Falsey and Walsh, 2006) , although adenovirus can occasionally be responsible for severe infections in long-term care facilities for the elderly (Kandel et al., 2010) .",

Therefore, despite the fact that 3 of the fatal cases had mixed infections with viruses (2 with HMPV and 1 with rhinovirus) there is a high probability that this bacteria could have contributed to these fatalities. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that viruses could have had an important contribution as well; autopsy was not ordered in any of the fatalities, and postmortem lung specimens were not collected, which could have helped to clarify this situation. Infections caused by L. pneumophila have been described in ECC but often go undetected (Seenivasan et al., 2005) , most facilities do not have the level of microbiology laboratory support that is available to acute care hospitals, and only if the resident is transferred to the hospital will he/she have access to different methods to detect this bacterium. Another important point is the fact that the L. pneumophila infection rate was probably underestimated, for the following reasons: L. pneumophila was searched only in severe infections, and more cases could have been found if this bacterium were searched in all patients; L. pneumophila infections show a seasonal pattern, with peak activity in late summer to autumn, and this study was held during the winter (Phin et al., 2014) ; and finally, upper respiratory samples are not the best samples for the diagnosis of these infections (Cho et al., 2012) .

An aetiological agent could be found in 60% of the acute respiratory episodes, a rate higher than usually reported (Ruuskanen et al., 2011) . Most of the infections were initially considered mild, but worsening was observed in a significant proportion of patients. \"Age\", \"HMPV\" and \"Respiratory disease\" were associates with severe infection. The data highlight the importance of searching both viruses and atypical bacteria in severe ARI in elderly patients, in particular L. pneumophila, which was associated with 6 fatalities in the studied population. The study also provided information about the circulating influenza viruses in this season.",
