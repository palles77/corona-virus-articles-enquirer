These findings indicate that travelers planning to visit MERS-CoV affected countries should be vaccinated against influenza virus. Here, we describe the results from a 2016 and 2017 surveillance study in the most populous province in Korea, the Gyeonggi province (population: 25.5 million; area: 11,730 km 2 ), and we demonstrate the Korean public health effort to prevent local transmission of MERS-CoV. In 2015, the Republic of Korea experienced a large outbreak of MERS-CoV with 186 laboratory-confirmed cases [2] . In this outbreak, interhospital and intra-hospital transmission were determination factors of the MERS-CoV infections [2] . After the outbreak, a Korean national surveillance program with virological testing for MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses was implemented to rapidly identify infected travelers returning from MERS-CoV-affected countries.",

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the suspected cases. There were 56 male cases among 99 suspected cases. Seven of the suspected cases had underlying disease (either hypertension or diabetes, or both).
