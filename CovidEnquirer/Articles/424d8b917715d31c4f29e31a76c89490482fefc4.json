Conclusions: Reviewing the usefulness of variables collected resulted in the recommendation that those included should be: overseas travel, reason for travel, entry and departure dates during the incubation period, vaccination details, traveller's and/or parents' country of birth, country of usual residence, time resident in current country, postcode, hospitalisation and death details. There was no agreement about whether ethnicity details should be collected.",

Similarly, a common vector for Chikungunya virus (Aedes albopictus) has expanded in Europe and the Americas [9] , resulting in outbreaks of this disease in countries not previously affected [10] . The Zika virus epidemic affecting countries in the Western Pacific and South America [11] is another important example of the consequences of disease importations. In Australia, dengue fever outbreaks in the northern state of Queensland have been linked to imported cases [12, 13] , and autochthonous transmission of chikungunya and Zika viruses is similarly possible due to vector presence [13] . Autochthonous mosquito-borne transmission of both dengue and chikungunya has also occurred in the United States and Europe in recent years [14, 15] , while sexual transmission of Zika virus has so far been reported in New Zealand, the United States, Europe and South America [16] .",
