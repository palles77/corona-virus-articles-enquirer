During the outbreak in 2003, this virus infected more than 8000 people, and the fatality rate in humans was as high as 15% (World Health Organization). Its easy transmissibility between humans makes the reemergence of SARS-CoV a distinct possibility, which entails an urgent need to prepare antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV. To date, there is no effective anti-SARS drug available with proven efficacy in vivo [2] , although vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV are being developed [3, 4] . Both compounds are competitive, selective, and reversible inhibitors of the PLpro with K is values $10 to 20 mM. A structure-function relationship study has identified the thiocarbonyl moiety of 6MP or 6TG as the active pharmacophore essential for these inhibitions, which has not been reported before. The inhibition is selective because these compounds do not exert significant inhibitory effects against other cysteine proteases, including SARS-CoV 3CLpro",

            "text": "PLpro of SARS-CoV is a papain-like cysteine protease with deubiquitinating activity. It is located on polypeptide 1a and self-cleaves at three sites on the polypeptide. Its catalytic triad (Cys1651-His1812-Asp1826) has a broad range of pH optima, characteristic of papain-like cysteine proteases [19, 20] . Moreover, PLpro has deubiquitinating activity in vitro, and is capable of hydrolyzing diubiquitin, polyubiquitin, and synthetic ubiquitin peptide substrates [20, 21] . Recently, its crystal structure has been solved, and it shows great similarity to those of two other mammalian deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), USP14 and herpesvirus-associated uiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) [22] [23] [24] . Despite low sequence identity (around 10%), these three proteins share similar tripartite architectures, comprising finger, palm, and thumb domains. There is also a ubiquitin-like domain at the amino terminus of PLpro, which might be responsible for its association with 26S proteasomes, as has been observed for USP14 and a yeast DUB called ubp6 [25] . PLpro also has de-ISGylation activity [21] . ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein involved in the posttranslational modification of proteins. The biological functions of the deubiquitination and de-ISGylation activities of PLpro and its in vivo substrates are unknown at present.",

The grid extension from the site was 3.0 \u00c5 , and the nonbonded cutoff distance was 10.0 \u00c5 . The softened potential energy and distance-dependent dielectric were used (the dielectric constant was 1.0).

The purified protease ran at around 52 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with over 90% purity (data not shown). MASS analysis was also carried out to determine the homogeneity of the enzyme preparation. Single peak around the molecular mass of 52,346 was observed, close to the predicted 52,645 Da (data not shown). When assayed with the peptide substrate under conditions similar to those reported previously [19] , the PLpro from this preparation exhibited very similar kinetic properties to the PLpro isolated from insect cells with the specific activity of 130 mMol min \u00c01 mg \u00c01 using the substrate Dabcyl-FRLKGGA-PIKGV-Edans, as compared to that of 404 mMol min \u00c01 mg \u00c01 from insect cells using the substrate Abz-FRLKGGAPIKGV-Edans [19] , suggesting that the expression system had no major influence on the properties. To identify potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, we screened a library containing 960 compounds using a screening platform that we had established previously [19] . Interestingly, we found that, apart from the zinc ion [19] , thiocarbonyl-containing 6MP (compound 1) and 6TG (compound 2) were effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, with IC 50 values of 21.6 and 5 mM, respectively (Table 1) . NEM (compound 6), a commonly used cysteine protease inhibitor that acts by covalently modifying the active-site Cys through Michael addition, was also found to be an effective inhibitor of PLpro with an IC 50 value of 4.4 mM, however, it was not further investigated. Because PLpro is a deubiquitination enzyme with a structure highly homologous to those of other DUBs [20, 21, 24] , we next tested whether 6MP and 6TG also inhibited the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro. Using ubiquitin-AMC as the substrate, we found that 6MP, 6TG, and Zn 2+ effectively inhibited the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro (Fig. 1) . To determine whether this inhibition is reversible, we first incubated the enzyme with both 6MP and 6TG until no activity of the enzyme could be detected. Next, the enzyme was purified with gel filtration, followed by new activity measurement. The enzymatic activity was restored, suggesting that the enzyme-inhibitor complex dissociated on the column and/or by dilution in the assay buffer, which is indicative of reversible inhibition.",

A substructure search based on the structures of 6MP and 6TG was carried out using the software ISIS (http://www.isis.rl.ac.uk/ dataanalysis/) against the MDL Available Chemical Directory (MDL ACD). Since the major difference between adenosine and 6MP/6TG lies in the thiocarbonyl group, we searched for the different substituted group at this site in the database. Compounds 3, 4 and 5 were discovered and available to purchase commercially (Section 2). Replacement of the thiocarbonyl of 6MP or 6TG with either hydroxyl (compound 3) or a methylthio group (compounds 4 and 5) resulted in compounds devoid of inhibitory activity ( Table 1 ), suggesting that the thiocarbonyl group of 6MP or 6TG is the active pharmacophore for the inhibition. To gain further insight into the inhibition mechanism, a docking experiment was performed. PLpro exists as a monomer in solution [19] . In the crystallization form, there are three monomers existing in the asymmetric unit [24] . The active sites for all three units were the same (data not shown). So we chose subunit one for the modeling study. Both 6MP and 6TG fit well into the active-site cavity of PLpro. The sulfur atom of 6MP or 6TG was juxtaposed closely with the g-S of Cys1651 at a distance of 3.4 \u00c5 , suggesting possible formation of a hydrogen bond (Fig. 2) . This is consistent with the active chemical properties of the thiocarbonyl group. The best docking scores for 6MP and 6TG binding to PLpro were 23.9 and 24.4, respectively. Moreover, the binding energies of 6MP and 6TG to PLpro were 8.2 and 14.7 kcal/mol, respectively.",

As summarized in Table 2 , in the pH range from 6.2 to 8.0, which was shown previously to be optimal for the enzymatic activity of PLpro [19] , the K m values for substrate hydrolysis in the absence of inhibitors ranged from 17 to 25 mM, whereas the k cat values ranged from 0.06 to 0.13 s \u00c01 . The Michaelis constant (K m ) for the substrate and inhibition constant for 6MP and 6TG (K is or K inact ) were similar. To understand the kinetic mechanism of this inhibition, a time-dependent change in enzyme activity as a function of the inhibitor concentration was determined by preincubating the PLpro enzyme with different concentrations of the inhibitors at 30 8C prior to measuring the enzyme activity. For 6MP, the semi-log plots of E t /E 0 versus time were linear in the initial stage (Fig. 4A) , and the pseudo-first-order rate constant (k inact ) at different inhibitor concentrations followed saturation kinetics (Fig. 4C) . For 6TG, the emission curve was curved downwards, indicating a slow-binding mechanism (Fig. 4B) . By fitting the data to Eq. (4) for 6TG (Fig. 4B ) (Section 2), different k inact values at various concentration of 6TG were determined (Fig. 4D) . When we further fitted the saturated curvature to Eq. (5), we determined that the K inact values for 6MP and 6TG were 48 and 32 mM, respectively, and the k max of inactivation were 0.12 and 0.92 ms \u00c01 , respectively (Table 2) . 6TG is a slightly more potent inhibitor than 6MP, as indicated by a slightly lower K inact and a eight-fold higher k max . In summary, both 6MP and 6TG are slow-binding inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, although both 6MP and 6TG have binding affinities for PLpro similar to that of the peptide substrate ( Table 2 ). Based on the above kinetic and modeling results, we propose the following kinetic mechanism (Fig. 5) . 6MP or 6TG might form a hydrogen bond with the enzyme's active site Cys1651 through the thio moiety of the thiocarbonyl group. The hydrogen bonding with Cys1651 blocks the essential sulfhydryl group, preventing its acylation and inhibiting the enzyme's activity.",

Initially, the other SARS-CoV protease 3CLpro, which is also a cysteine protease, was tested for possible inhibition by 6MP and 6TG. A comparison with PLpro was therefore made at 200 mM inhibitor concentration and a 2 h incubation time. Whereas both inhibitors at this concentration almost completely abolished the activity of PLpro (<5% residual activity), they were found to be much less effective inhibitors of 3CLpro (49% residual activity for 6MP and 25% for 6TG, respectively). In the next step, we also used molecular modeling to dock the inhibitors to 3CLpro. The best docking scores for 6MP and 6TG to 3CLpro were 17.8 and 18.4, respectively, which are lower than those for 6MP and 6TG (23.9 and 24.4, respectively). Moreover, the binding energies of 6MP and 6TG to 3CLpro were \u00c014.7 and \u00c016.2 kcal/mol, respectively, which are lower than those to PLpro (8.2 and 14.7 kcal/mol, respectively). Finally, the sulfur atoms of 6MP and 6TG occur at distances of 5.4 and 8.5 \u00c5 , respectively, from the g-S of Cys145 of 3CLpro, too far away to maintain a functional hydrogen bond. Therefore, the lower binding energies, lower docking scores, and greater distances of the drugs from 3CLpro are consistent with the biochemical data that these two drugs are not effective inhibitors of 3CLpro. Moreover, 6MP and 6TG were not effective inhibitors of other cysteine proteases, including cathepsins B, K, L, and S, and papain, even at a concentration of 1 mM (data not shown). Therefore, it seems that 6MP and 6TG are reasonably selective inhibitors of PLpro and do not inhibit other cysteine proteases. (1)).

To our knowledge, 6MP and 6TG are the first reversible chemical inhibitors documented to inhibit PLpro of SARS-CoV, whereas many inhibitors have been developed for the other protease of SARS-CoV, 3CLpro [9] . In this study, we have identified these two compounds as slow-binding inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro, likely compete for the same binding site as the substrate. At the current stage, we could not rule out the possibility that the inhibition is through binding to an allosteric site thereby changing the conformation of the active site. Nevertheless, the inhibition is competitive, reversible and selective against PLpro. Although the affinity of 6MP and 6TG against PLpro is in the mM range, they could be used as lead compounds for further optimization to enhance their potency against SARS-CoV. There are many 4)). (C and D) The observed inactivation rate constants (k inact ) from panels A and B were replotted against 6MP or 6TG concentration. The solid line is the fit of the saturation equation (Eq. (5)) (R sqr = 0.992 and 0.975, respectively). The best-fit parameters (K inact and k max ) are shown in Table 2 . The same experiments were repeated at least three times. such examples reported in the past of successful antiviral treatments with old drugs [36] . In light of the availability of several animal models [4] , especially the one infected by a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, which reproduces many aspects of the human disease including morbidity, mortality and pulmonary pathology [16] . It would be interesting to test whether these two drugs are effective in blocking SARS-CoV replication in these animal models.",

In light of the acute toxicities associated with these drugs and the active thiocarbonyl against subsets of cysteine proteases, the in vivo action of 6MP and 6TG might be more complex than we realize at this stage. It is well documented that 6MP causes some adverse drug reactions in a significant number of patients, which have been found to be caused by a genetic polymorphism of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). The polymorphism produces a TPMT with much lower activity [37, 38] . These patients are less able to metabolize 6MP to the inactive 6-methyl mercaptopurine, resulting in the accumulation of 6TG and subsequent life-threatening myelosuppression [37] [38] [39] . About 1 in 300 individuals carries a mutated TPMT and does not express fully functional TPMT [40] . For these patients, less than 10% of the normal dosage of 6MP can be tolerated [39] . It is likely that locally high dosage of 6MP/6TG might inhibit the subset of cysteine proteases, thereby contributing to the severe cytotoxic effects observed by these two drugs. Furthermore, 6MP can also be metabolically processed by hepatic cytochrome P450 to purine-6sulfenic acid, which binds to proteins by forming disulfide bonds with the thio moieties of the proteins both in vitro and in vivo [41, 42] . Whether purine-6-sulfenic acid forms the disulfide bonds with cellular cysteine proteases remains to be studied.",

To date, there is no potent selective chemical compound available for the inhibition of cellular deubiquitination enzymes other than a ubiquitin aldehyde developed for laboratory studies of the function of DUBs by covalent attachment to the active-site Cys [43, 44] . Hence, the biological consequences of inhibiting DUBs are not clear at the moment. Moreover, the functions of the deubiquitination and de-ISGylation activities of PLpro in vivo are also unknown, as are those of its in vivo cellular substrates. Adenovirus encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme [45] , which is necessary for processing viral precursor proteins during virion maturation [46] . ISGylation and de-ISGylation are involved in the innate immune response to viral infection [47] . Therefore, whether 6MP and 6TG inactivate the cellular DUBs that contribute to adverse drug reactions or other biological consequences requires further investigation. Because both drugs are still used extensively in clinics, especially for children with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia [26, 27] , our study has emphasized the importance to study in depth these drug actions in vivo.",
