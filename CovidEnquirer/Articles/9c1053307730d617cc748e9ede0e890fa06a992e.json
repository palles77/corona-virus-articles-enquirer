This study aimed to estimate the monthly incidence of MERS-CoV cases and to investigate their correlation to climate factors. Methods: The study used aggregated monthly MERS-CoV cases that reported to the Saudi Center for Disease Prevention and Control from the Riyadh Region between November 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Data on the meteorological situation throughout the study period was calculated based on Google reports on the Riyadh Region (24.7136 \u2022 N, 46.6753 \u2022 E). The Poisson regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each climate factor. Results: A total of 712 MERS-CoV cases were included in the analysis (mean age 54.2 \u00b1 9.9 years), and more than half (404) (56.1%) MERS-CoV cases were diagnosed during a five-month period from . High temperatures (IRR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.043-1.065) and a high ultraviolet index (IRR = 1.401, 95% CI: 1.331-1.475) were correlated with a higher incidence of MERS-CoV cases. However, low relative humidity (IRR = 0.956, 95% CI: 0.948-0.964) and low wind speed (IRR = 0.945, 95% CI: 0.912-0.979) were correlated with a lower incidence of MERS-CoV cases. Conclusion: The novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, is influenced by climate conditions with increasing incidence between April and August. High temperature, high ultraviolet index, low wind speed, and low relative humidity are contributors to increased MERS-CoV cases. The climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings and integrated into guidelines to serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection.",

The findings of this study may represent primary MERS-CoV cases. In addition, Gardner categorized climate variables into groups: tertiles and halves. However, our study tends to report the correlation between climate variables (as quantitative) and the occurrence of all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. The study also assesses the effects of five climate factors: temperature, rela- tive humidity, ultraviolet index, cloud, and wind speed, which have been reported to be mostly associated with viral activity in primary cases [9] . The monthly variations in MERS-CoV frequencies [10] should be further investigated by exploring the role of climate factors on the incidence of MERS-CoV infection. This may provide better understanding and the ability to prepare and implement an efficient health information system to reduce the incidence of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the monthly incidence and to investigate the effects of climate factors on the monthly frequency of MERS-CoV infections reported from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was hypothesized that the monthly average of temperature, ultraviolet index, relative humidity, cloud, and wind speed are important factors of the MERS-CoV occurrence in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",

These climate factors must be evaluated in hospitals and community settings, as the virus appears more viable in certain weather [11] conditions and geographic regions [3] . Finding of such studies can serve as source of control measures to prevent and eliminate the risk of infection, particularly in Saudi Arabia.",

In agreement with previous reports [11, 13] , the study highlights the need for considering climate factors on MERS-CoV guidelines for control measures and prevention. The overall findings of the study are that the higher the temperature and ultraviolet index, the higher incidence of MERS-CoV infections, and vice versa for humidity and wind speed. However, we noted limitations in this study. A number of potential confounding factors such as patient characteristics and source of the infections were not included in our investigation. The climate data were taken retrospectively from Google reports on a monthly basis during the span in which the cases were reported. The authors were not able to assess the influence of climate factors on the source of infection, the route of transmission, or the susceptible population. The impact of climate factors on incidence of MERS-CoV in small environments such as families and hospitals can be addressed in future studies.",
