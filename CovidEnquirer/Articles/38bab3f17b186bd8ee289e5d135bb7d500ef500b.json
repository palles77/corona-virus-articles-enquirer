We calculated the temporal probability of transmission 90 between and from the number of days between the dates of infection of the two cases and and 91 the generation time of the disease (t).

After 157 removing the burn-in period and thinning the chain, we deleted the unlikely transmission links in each 158 iteration and identified transmission clusters. Therefore, unlike the previous versions of outbreaker2, 159 the number of importations in each sample can vary and the individual probability of being an 160 importation can be computed (Figure 2). 161 Validation case study: measles outbreaks in the United States between 2001 and 2016 162 Data 163 To evaluate the performance of the model, we inferred the transmission clusters from a dataset that also 164 included information on whether measles cases were part of a cluster based on contact tracing 165 investigations. Measles cases in the United States are reported by healthcare providers and clinical 166 laboratories to their corresponding health department. Each case is investigated by local and state health 167 departments classified according to standard case definitions[46], and linked into clusters 168 epidemiologically (e.g., by establishing a direct contact or a shared location between cases, or when 169 cases are part of a specific community where an outbreak is occurring). Cases are considered 170 internationally imported if at least part of the exposure period (7-21 days before rash onset) occurred 171 outside the United States and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no 172 known exposure to measles in the United States during the exposure period. 173 Confirmed measles cases are routinely reported by state health departments to the CDC. 2,098 measles 174 cases were reported in the United States between January 2001 and December 2016. The number of 175 annual cases did not exceed 700 cases during this time period (Figure 3, Supplement",

We have presented a method for estimating the cluster size distribution of past 395 measles outbreaks from routinely collected surveillance data. We found that adding prior knowledge 396 on the importation status of cases improved the inference of the transmission clusters. Although the 397 method was able to identify a proportion of importations, epidemiological investigations on the history 398 of travel and exposure reduced uncertainty on the clustering of cases. We believe these investigations 399 are needed to produce reliable estimates of past transmission clusters. In lieu of the importation status, 400 if multiple genotypes are co-circulating, increasing the proportion of genotyped cases could help discard 401 potential connections and find imported cases. Even with limited information, this method was able to 402 infer probabilistic transmission clusters in a fast and efficient way. 403The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent 412 the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of",
