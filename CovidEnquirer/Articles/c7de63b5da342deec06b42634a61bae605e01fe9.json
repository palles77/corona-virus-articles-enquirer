Simultaneous administration of CPV and CDV vaccines has been reported to decrease the number of circulating lymphocytes which may in fact produce a temporary state of immunosuppression (Kesel and Neil, 1983; Mastro et al., 1986; Phillips et al., 1989) . The host defense system is traditionally divided into two functionally overlapping categories: the humoral immune system and the cellular immune system (Schultz, 1982a) .

The response of pups less than 3 weeks of age to viral antigens is reported to be lower than that of adult dogs and their lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen stimulation reaches adult values between 6 weeks and 6 months of age (Banks, 1982) .

Our third female was vaccinated pre-breeding but only achieved a CPV antibody titer of 1:160 at the time of whelping. The reason for these poor antibody levels in our adult greyhounds is unknown but could be attributed to environmental stresses. Average antibody titers to CPV vaccination were poor in both experimental groups with all puppies not achieving protective antibody titers until 22 weeks of age. Although the reason for this poor antibody response to CPV is unknown, it should be noted that both schedules initially used killed parvo vaccines. A recent report (Blythe et al., 1994) advocating the use of killed parvo vaccines until 12-13 weeks of age in kennel situations states that modified live parvo vaccines can lower the immune status of pups for up to 3 days. Recent work in this laboratory investigating the use of modified live parvo vaccines in greyhound pups beginning at 6 weeks of age and then vaccinating every 3 weeks have recorded higher CPV antibody titers than when killed vaccines are used (unpublished data). Modified live vaccines typically give a better immune response than killed vaccines by virtue of their ability to undergo limited replication in the host which stimulates both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity (Ellis, 1988) . Since killed vaccines do not replicate in the host they are inherently less efficient inducers of the cell-mediated immune system. It is possible that the killed parvo vaccine administration to these young greyhounds resulted in enough seroconversion to inhibit the ability of the modified live vaccine to replicate. Consequently, lower antibody titers to CPV resulted. A decline in CPV antibody titers was observed in two litters at 12-16 weeks of age. A similar decline in CDV antibody titers post-vaccination has been reported in greyhounds (Webster, 1977) .",

Another study, however, found no evidence of immunosuppression as a result of CPV vaccination (Phillips and Schultz, 1987) . A recent study (Miyamoto et al., 1992) reported a decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts on day 7 post vaccination in both puppies and adult dogs. This study also demonstrated an increase in the blastogenic response of lymphocytes after vaccination in puppies and no change in adult dogs. Consequently, suppression as indicated by lymphopenia or decreased response to mitogen stimulation may be dependent upon sampling time post-vaccination. Our investigations were conducted in order to examine the difference in the immune response to traditional vs. aggressive vaccination protocols and to determine if aggressive vaccination is beneficial in terms of immune function.",

This effect could be due to the more frequent stimulation of the immune system by the maximum vaccination schedule resulting in the proliferation of immature T-lymphocyte subpopulations. Or, as Miyamoto et al. (1992) suggested, vaccination may act in an immunomodulatory fashion in puppies resulting in an increased blastogenic response. The maximum vaccination group did not exhibit a greater response than the minimum vaccination group to stimulation by PHA. Con A has been shown to be a strict T-cell mitogen for the dog. PHA is capable of causing both T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte differentiation (Krakowka and Ringler, 1986) . If immature T-lymphocytes comprise a greater percentage of the peripheral blood population in the maximum vaccination group, these immature T-lymphocytes would be more responsive to Con A than to PHA.",

These antibodies bind to mutually exclusive populations of canine peripheral blood lymphocytes in proportions similar to monoclonals described by Gebhard and Carter (1992) and are co-expressed on approximately 50% of thymocytes from Beagle pups. This is in agreement with the proportion of double positive lymphocyte expression in the thymus of all species where monoclonals have been defined (Tompkins et al., 1990) . Anti-feline CD4 antibody additionally binds to canine peripheral blood granulocytes and immunoprecipitates reduced peptides in the range of 32-37 kDa. This is comparable to that reported for canine specific CD4 antibody (Gebhard and Carter, 1992) . Reported normal values of these lymphocytes subpopulations for adult dogs and cats are similar with 39% CD4 t-and 18% CD8 -t lymphocytes in the dog and 34% CD4 + and 19% CD8 + lymphocytes in the cat (Dean, et al., 1991; Gebhard and Carter, 1992) .

A significant treatment effect and a treatment by time interaction existed for CD4 labeled lymphocytes and for lymphocytes expressing surface IgG. The average weekly means for the minimum vaccination groups were higher than the maximum vaccination groups from 5 weeks of age until the completion of the study (Figs. 3 and 4) . This difference, however, was not significant at any one point in time when the least squares means were compared. Consequently, the difference in treatment appears to depend on the week or on the sampling time post vaccination and not on the specific treatment.",

This could be the result of different sampling times post vaccination in the two treatment groups. The minimum vaccination groups received a modified live vaccine 1 week prior to both of these sampling times. The maximum vaccination groups received a killed vaccine at 9 weeks of age and a modified live vaccine at 12 weeks of age. The higher percentage of IgM expressing lymphocytes may be a reflection of seroconversion in the minimum vaccination groups. A similar proliferation could have occurred in the maximum vaccination groups after the, 12 week modified live vaccination but due to a difference in sampling time post vaccination this response was not detected. In addition, no overall significant treatment effect was detected for IgM expressing lymphocytes. Consequently, this does not likely represent a deficiency in the immune response of the maximum vaccination groups.",

Although this practice does not appear to be detrimental to the immune system, the cost vs. benefit of implementing such extensive vaccination schedules is questionable. It is important to note, however, that most racing greyhounds in kennel situations are exposed to environmental conditions that were not present in the laboratory experiments described here. Therefore, further evaluation of the influence of multiple vaccination schedules on the immune system of racing greyhounds raised in kennel situations and exposed to environmental stress is currently being conducted in this laboratory.",
