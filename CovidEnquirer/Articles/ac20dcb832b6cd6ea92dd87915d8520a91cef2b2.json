Formaldehyde induces both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in a variety of test systems. Inhalation of formaldehyde causes cancer of the nose in rats. The concentrations of formaldehyde in inhaled air that caused nasal cancer in Fisher 344 rats are within the same order of magnitude as those to which humans may be exposed. The data presently available do not permit a direct assessment of the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde to man. Epidemiologic studies on exposed human populations are in progress and may further clarify the situation. Other experimental and human studies on toxic effects such as teratogenicity and reproductive disorders are as yet inadequate for a health risk assessment.",

Its presence in building materials, such as insulation, particle board, and plywood, as well as in other products, has resulted in complaints to the federal regulatory agencies. For example, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has received a number of complaints from consumers concerning adverse health effects associated with the release of formaldehyde gas from urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (4) . Consumers have also expressed concern that the high concentrations of formaldehyde within their mobile homes may be unhealthy (5) . Complaints such as these arise because formaldehyde causes irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and skin, persistent cough, shortness of breath, nausea, headaches, and dizziness. Similar symptoms have been reported by workers who were exposed to formaldehyde resins that are used in the wood, textile, rubber and leather industries.",

This concern was reinforced in January, 1980, when representatives of the Interagency Regulatory Liaison Group (IRLG) reviewed the carcinogenicity data in detail (6) . As a result, CPSC, in cooperation with the IRLG agencies, convened a panel of scientists from eight federal agencies under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program to review health data related to formaldehyde. As part of this review, the panel members were asked to consider the following questions (7): * Is there evidence indicating that formaldehyde may be tumorigenic/carcinogenic at doses other than 15 ppm in the CIIT study? * Are there confounding factors in the CIIT study such as the irritating properties of formaldehyde, viral infection, special susceptibility of the rat to irritants, or protocol defects? If so, what are the relative merits of these factors? * What conclusions can be drawn from the 140 tumorigenic/carcinogenic results in the CIIT study? * What is the applicability of the conclusions drawn in the CIIT study to the human situation? * What is the relation of animal data from other irritant carcinogens to the human situation? * How do other formaldehyde studies in animals and epidemiological studies affect conclusions about the human carcinogenicity of formaldehyde? * Do short-term mutagenicity data support findings of carcinogenicity? * What conclusions can be reached concerning the potential human carcinogenicity of formaldehyde? * Are there additional data needed? * Are these findings relevant to exposure from other routes? * Is there evidence that formaldehyde is teratogenic or causes reproductive effects? To address these questions the panel evaluated the published literature and available data from ongoing studies. This report is the result of the panel's review.",

            "text": "Additional studies (19) have shown that following subcutaneous administration of '4C-formaldehyde to rats, approximately 81% of the radioactivity appeared as CO2. A small amount of the radioactivity was found in choline. Almost 60% of a subcutaneous dose of 14C-formate similarly appeared as 14C-CO2, with small amounts of radioactivity in choline. Neely (20) administered formaldehyde intraperitoneally (IP) to rats and found that 82% of radiolabel was recovered as CO2 and 13-14% as urinary methionine, serine and a cysteine adduct. At lower doses, only methionine was labeled. The author postulated that CO2 was derived from serine (formed from glycine and N5, Nl0-methylene tetrahydrofolate) by deamination to pyruvate and oxidation in the Krebs cycle. The formation of methionine from 14C-formaldehyde and homocysteine had previously been demonstrated by Berg (21) . Formation of methionine would also account for the labeled choline observed by DuVigneaud et al. (19) identified. These are shown in Figure 1 (14) and Palese and Tephly (24) have demonstrated that the catalase reaction ( Fig. 1) is not of major importance and that the primary pathway to CO2 from formate occurs via the tetrahydrofolic acid pathway. This has been demonstrated in rat liver perfusates (23) , monkeys (14) and rats (24) . Since the tetrahydrofolic acid pathway (Fig. 2 Environmental Health Perspectives lead to the transfer of the carbon from formate to a number of other compounds (including serine), it is not clear that the 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase reaction (Fig. 1) is the only reaction of importance for CO2 production in this pathway. The sources of formate in Figure 2 include the degradation of amino acids such as histidine and tryptophan, and possibly serine and glycine as well. Formaldehyde or formate can also result from N-demethylation of drugs such as aminopyrine or ethylmorphine (23, 25) or the metabolism of dihalomethanes (26) .",

In both treated groups, formaldehyde caused a 14-15% increase in the length of gestation; it also increased the average body weight of the offspring and their heart, adrenal, and kidney weights. These changes might have resulted from the extended gestation time. In contrast, the liver and lungs from pups in the treated groups weighed less than those ofthe control pups. Although Gofmekler stated that there was a decrease in the litter size, his data suggest that this may not be accurate. Our calculations, based on data in Gofmekler's article, show that groups exposed to 0.012 and 1.0 mg/m3 of formaldehyde had average litter sizes of 19.6 and 17.3 pups, respectively, as compared to the control value of 11.2. These calculations assume that all females in each group became pregnant. Gofmekler stated that some females in each group did not become pregnant, but did not report the details. This implies that several dams produced over 20 pups each.",

They measured ascorbic acid in whole embryo, placenta, maternal liver and fetal liver; \"nucleic acids\" (apparently RNA) in maternal liver, fetal brain and fetal liver; and DNA in maternal and fetal liver. Significant decreases in ascorbic acid concentrations occurred in the whole embryo and in the maternal liver at both dose levels. A significant increase in ascorbic acid concentration in liver occurred in offspring from dams exposed to 0.012 mg/m3. RNA concentrations in maternal livers were greater at both dose levels than they were in controls. RNA concentrations of fetal brain were similar in control and treated groups. DNA content was significantly lower in maternal and fetal liver in both treated groups than in control animals. The authors concluded that formaldehyde \"significantly inhibited the synthesis of nucleic acids.\" This conclusion is not, however, supported by the data in the article. Gofmekler and Bonashevskaya (37) reported the data related to histopathological changes in the liver and kidneys of fetuses from dams exposed to formaldehyde. The hepatic changes included an increased proliferation of epithelial cells in the bile duct and segmented forms in the hepatic sinusoids. The kidney changes included renal epithelial cells with polymorphic nuclei, casts in the lumina of some tubules, and functional alterations in the renal tubule apparatus. Exposure to 1.0 mg/m3 of formaldehyde also caused a decrease in myocardial glycogen, an involution of the thymic lymphoid tissue and disintegration of lymphocytes. Histologically, the testes of adult males exposed to formaldehyde were similar to those of the controls.",

By two months, the hemoglobin and leukocyte concentrations were decreased in progeny of dosed dams but not in a dose-related manner. Guseva (39) studied the gonadotropic effects of formaldehyde by measuring testicular nucleic acid content in rats. During a 6 month treatment period, 3 groups of male rats were subjected to a combined action of formaldehyde orally (in drinking water) and by inhalation. Group 1 received formaldehyde at a concentration of 0.1 mg/l in drinking water and by inhalation at a level of 0.5 mg/mi. Group 2 received formaldehyde at a concentration of 0.01 mg/l and by inhalation at a level of 0.25 mg/m3. Group 3 received formaldehyde at a concentration of 0.005 mg/l and by inhalation at a level of 0.12 mg/m3. Group 4 served as untreated controls. Treatment in the drinking water was continuous and simultaneous exposure to formaldehyde by both routes occurred five times per week for 4 hr each time. Reproductive function was evaluated by pairing each treated male with two virgin untreated females. Although the number of males was not Environmental Health Perspectives specified, the use of six females per group implies the use of three males in each group. On day 20, an unspecified number of pregnant females were killed and their offspring were removed and examined. Guseva failed to mention the results of the examination of the fetuses. The remaining dams were allowed to produce offspring. The number and weight of newborn rats were recorded. Observations of their subsequent development extended over one month. The time of eye opening and other developmental indices were recorded for the offspring of males in groups 1 and 3 only. The capacity of the treated males to produce offspring was not diminished. There was no effect on the weight of the fetuses or the size of the litters. The offspring were morphologically normal at birth and developed normally thereafter. Gonadotrophin levels were not significantly different between males in the control group and those in the treatment groups.

There are no data on the induction of aneuploidy by nondisjunction or any other mechanism. In this respect, the most extensive data result from experiments with Drosophila on formaldehyde-treated food. It is not known how representative these data are of genetic effects that would be expected from exposures to vapors or solutions. The Drosophila data show that 64% of the transmitted chromosomal effects studied resulted from small duplications or deficiencies, the remainder were due to large inversions and translocations. No data were found which would be useful in determining whether a comparable spectrum of genetic alterations would be found with lower chronic levels of exposure. In conclusion, although heritable genetic damage has been demonstrated, only small increases would be expected from the levels of formaldehyde which might reach the germ cells. The Drosophila data, for example, indicate that sensitivity is limited to effects on males and is restricted to early spermatocytes; whether similar effects can be expected in whole animal systems is unknown.",

F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice (120 male and 120 female rats or mice per group) were chronically exposed to 2.1, 5.6 and 14.1 ppm of formaldehyde vapors for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week. During the first 18 months of exposure, 2, 2, 8 and 44 rats died in the groups exposed to 0, 2.1, 5.6 and 14.1 ppm of formaldehyde, respectively. Of the 44 rats which died spontaneously in the group exposed to 14.1 ppm, 32 had nasal tumors (28 squamous carcinomas and four squamous papillomas). Many of the rats also showed hyperplastic and metaplastic lesions of the nasal epithelium. Hyperplastic and metaplastic lesions were also detected in rats exposed to 5.6 ppm formaldehyde (14 lesions were found in eight rats), indicating that the nasal epithelium was significantly damaged at this lower level of exposure. At 18 months of exposure, 40 rats were killed in each group. Eight of 40 rats exposed to 14.1 ppm had developed nasal squamous carcinomas. Although 150 no carcinomas of the airways were found in the other groups, one adenomatous polyp was found in one rat of each of the groups exposed to 2.1, 5.6 and 14.1 ppm. In addition, a large number of hyperplastic and metaplastic lesions was detected in the nasal epithelium of these rats, even at formaldehyde concentrations as low as 2.1 ppm. No exposurerelated tissue abnormalities were reported at sites other than the nasal cavities and no exposurerelated neoplasias were reported in formaldehyde exposed mice, but examination of the animals sacrificed after 24 months of exposure is not complete. * One complication noticed during the study was a spontaneous outbreak in rats of sialodacryoadenitis. The evidence for this consisted of decreased body weight in all dosed and control rat groups at about the 52nd week of the experiment, followed by prompt recovery of body weight, and histopathological demonstration of typical lesions in lacrimal and salivary glands and in the upper respiratory tissues of dosed and control rats in the 12 month sacrifice groups. Evidence of sialodacryoadenitis was not found in rats sacrificed at 6 or 18 months or in those with unscheduled deaths.

One hundred male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a mixture of gaseous formaldehyde (14.7 ppm) and hydrogen chloride (10.6 ppm) for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for life. Of the exposed rats, 27% developed nasal tumors, of which 25 were squamous carcinomas and *The Chemical Industry Institute ofToxicology recently reported results up to and including the 24 months sacrifice, as follows: in rats exposed at 14.1 ppm there were 93 animals with squamous cell carcinomas, four with squamous papillomas, three with adenomatous polyps and two with carcinomas of the respiratory epithelium; at 5.6 ppm there were two squamous cell carcinomas, four adenomatous polyps and one carcinoma of the respiratory epithelium; and at 2.1 ppm, five rats had developed adenomatous polyps. Additionally, two mice sacrificed at 24 months were found to have nasal squamous cell carcinomas (80) . two were papillomas. No nasal tumors were found in 100 control rats. Both dosed and control rats had pneumonia but the lesions were more severe in dosed rats. The estimated bis(chloromethyl) ether (BCME) level in the exposure chamber (developing as a result of the chemical interaction of formaldehyde and hydrogen chloride) was 1 ppb. This value was computed on the basis of 10 measurements made in the mixing chamber during the course of the study. It is not certain whether the high nasal cancer incidence is a result of the formaldehyde exposure, the (presumed) BCME exposure, or the biological interaction of the two or three components of the gas mixture. Based on their previous studies (83) , the authors considered the BCME level to be too low to be a significant etiological factor for the nasal cancers observed in this study. They also point to the fact that in rats, BCME caused mostly esthesioneuroepitheliomas rather than squamous carcinomas in the nasal cavities. While the results suggest that formaldehyde (rather than BCME) is the major etiological agent in this experiment, considerable uncertainty remains and other interpretations are possible. The authors' comparison of 20 exposure days at 100 ppb of BCME (83) with 500 exposure days at 1 ppb of BCME (82) does not, however, resolve the uncertainty of comparing the different factors involved in dose-rate versus total delivered dose in tumor induction.",

Since the nasal tissues were not systematically examined histologically, the value of these studies in assessing the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde is accordingly limited. In spite of these reservations, the studies have some bearing on the problem of formaldehyde carcinogenicity. In the studies conducted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) by Nettesheim and colleagues (84) , Syrian Golden hamsters were exposed by intratracheal (ITr) instillation to different doses of benz(a)pyrene (BaP) and by inhalation to various concentrations of formaldehyde (acrolein exposures were carried out in parallel studies). Two types of formaldehyde exposure schedules were used: 10 ppm for 5 hr/day, 5 days/week for life (two groups) and 20 or 50 ppm for 5 hr/day, 1 day/week for 17 weeks (seven groups). In all, nine groups of 88 hamsters each were exposed to formaldehyde (with or without BaP exposures; two groups were exposed to formaldehyde only). Significant in the context of this discussion is that no macroscopically recognizable nasal tumors were observed in hamsters, whereas in the studies with rats by Swenberg et al. (79) and by Laskin et al. February 1982 (82) , grossly visible tumors developed. Based on extensive histopathological evaluation, there was no evidence for the carcinogenicity or cocarcinogenicity of formaldehyde for the larynx, trachea and lower airways. No neoplasms were found in two sections of nose from each hamster, but the level of sectioning was not rigorously controlled.",

Coal tar aerosol exposure resulted in lung tumor formation in five animals (one invasive carcinoma) but formaldehyde exposure did not. No evidence was found for any cocarcinogenic effects of formaldehyde. The major shortcomings of this study for evaluating the carcinogenic activity of formaldehyde are that too few animals survived past one year, the individual exposures were short, most groups were exposed only for 35 weeks, and histopathology was inadequately reported.",

There is reason to believe that formaldehyde was a major, if not the only, etiological factor (see above).

It has been reported that exposure of the oral mucosa of rabbits to formalin causes advanced preneoplastic lesions (carcinoma in situ) (87) . Fonnaldehyde has been reported to cause transformation in vitro in a mammalian cell line (88) . Formaldehyde has been shown to be genotoxic in many different test systems (see section on formaldehyde mutagenesis). A closely related aldehyde, namely acetaldehyde, was recently reported to cause nasal cancers (5%) and laryngeal cancers (14%) in hamsters chronically exposed by inhalation to 1650-2500 ppm for 52 weeks (7 hr/day, 5 days/week) (94).",

Neoplastic transformation of mouse Balb/3T3 cells in culture has been demonstrated (88) . Chronic inhalation of the closely related short chain aliphatic aldehyde, acetaldehyde, has been reported to cause not only nasal but also laryngeal carcinomas in hamsters (94) .

Nasal mucosa is directly exposed to formaldehyde and may receive the highest dose although differences in tissue sensitivity and metabolism might also be involved. It should be mentioned that formaldehyde is not the only chemical carcinogen affecting the nasal mucosa. Other carcinogens, in addition to BCME, (including systemic ones) also cause nasal tumors of susceptible hosts, for example, various nitrosamines as well as dioxane and ethylene dibromide (95) . The experimental induction of nasal tumors in laboratory animals is thus not a rarity and does not necessarily involve direct contact, through inhalation, with the nasal mucosa of the test compound.",

The possibility that the infection (presumably caused by a corona virus) contributed to the carcinoma response in this study cannot be discounted, but the panel considered it unlikely, because the signs of infection occurred during a very short portion of the experiment (at most a week) and the first detected nasal tumors had probably already formed at the time of the infection. Although the outbreak of sialodacryoadenitis introduced an uncontrolled variable into the experiment, it is unlikely that the transient viral infection affected the outcome of the experiment.

Repeated mechanical skin abrasion was recently found to have a promoting effect on mouse epidermis (102) . It is therefore conceivable that the \"irritant\" effect offormaldehyde, or more specifically its induction of epithelial hyperplasia, may contribute to some extent to the expression of its carcinogenic activity through a mechanism enhancing the promoting or tumor growth stage of carcinogenesis.

Circumstances that allow an exposure associated with a disease to be judged a cause of the disease have been best described by Hill (107) . First is the strength of the association. Second is the consistency of the observation. The evidence for causality is more persuasive when the association has been repeatedly observed under various circumstances by independent investigators using different methods. Third is the specificity of the association. When a specific exposure is associated with a certain disease, there is a 154 strong argument for cause and effect. In light of multicausation of most diseases, however, the lack of specificity does not irrevocably discount A causal hypothesis. Fourth is the temporal relationship of the exposure and disease. Cross-sectional and case control studies are poorly equipped to settle this issue. Fifth is evidence of a dose-response gradient. Sixth is the plausibility and coherence of the hypothesis.

Chronic health effects attributed to fornaldehyde from cross-sectional studies include respiratory problems, dermatitis, neurologic difficulties, and menstrual and reproductive disorders. Schoenberg and Mitchell (120) studied five groups of employees from a filter-manufacturing plant to determine adverse effects of exposure to phenolic (phenol-formaldehyde) resin fumes. Groups currently exposed to phenolic resins showed an excess of chronic cough and/or phlegm when compared to previously exposed or \"never-on-line\" groups. In addition, after adjustments were made for differences in total cigarette consumption, workers on the present production line more than five years had a significantly lower FEV1.O/FVC and MEF 50%/FVC ratio (p S 0.05) than the \"never-on-line\" group. These results suggest that long term exposure to phenol-formaldehyde resin fumes may lead to chronic airway obstruction. No systematic measurement of formaldehyde concentration was made during this study but, based on measurements by others, levels were estimated to be in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 ppm. Exceptionally high levels (8.8 to 13.5 ppm) occasionally occurred when cross-current fans were turned off during part of the sampling period. In this study every control subject was occasionally exposed to resin fumes, which may explain the high prevalence of acute symptoms such as eye irritation (80%), nose irritation (53%), and lower respiratory tract symptoms (47%) among \"never-on-line\" workers. Shift studies suggested a small reduction in lung function in the production line workers, whereas control workers showed a small increase. As noted by the authors, the limitations of this study include small numbers of exposed subjects, probable formaldehyde exposure among some controls, and the potential for selective bias commonly associated with cross-sectional studies. In addition, the possible role of the parent resins, phenol, and other exposure from the industrial process, such as acrylic fiber break-down products, prevents a clear determination that long-term exposure to formaldehyde may lead to chronic airway obstruction.",

The resin investigated in this study used resorcinol as the phenol donor and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as both a formaldehyde donor and a catalyst. There was no association between lung function and ambient levels of resorcinol, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide or ammonia. Mean concentrations of formaldehyde were 0.05, 0.02 and 0.04 ppm for HR-exposed, HR-not exposed, and control group, respectively. Decrease in pulmonary function was related to the quantity of respirable particulates obtained from personal samples. Chemical analysis of particulates, however, was not performed.

Recurrent episodes of productive cough accompanied by wheeze were a prominent feature and, for five persons, attacks had extended over the previous three years. Inhalation provocation tests were performed on five subjects with histories of recurrent attacks of wheezing. In two of these subjects the test resulted in asthmatic attacks like those experienced at work. Peak expiratory flow rates fell approximately 50% and wheezing began 2 and 3 hr after exposure to formalin and lasted for 10 hr to 10 days. Three of the five subjects had no respiratory reaction to inhalation of formaldehyde similar to that experienced in the dialysis unit. Two of the five had no symptoms, while one developed conjunctivitis. This latter patient developed redness, weeping and sensations of grittiness of the eyes when heavily exposed to formalin. In the absence of symptoms and exposure there was no apparent reduction in lung function. The authors suggest that although formalin may not have been the etiologic agent in all cases, it may have increased the susceptibility to other agents, which could, perhaps, explain the high incidence of bronchitis-like symptoms. In the absence of a comparison group, an alternative explanation of the 156 asthma being attributable to chance alone still exists. However, the explanation is unlikely because of the high proportion of the staff which developed the symptoms and because of the positive responses observed after the inhalation provocation test.",

They experienced acute toxic effects including eye and nose burning, sneezing, coughing, and headaches. Asthma or sinus problems were reported by 3 out of 7 morticians. In addition, two workers experienced dermatitis, with one case being so severe that he discontinued working for a period of time until he recovered. Although it was the professed intention of the authors to correlate the formaldehyde concentrations in each funeral home with the irritant effects on embalmers who worked at the particular funeral home, no data were presented to that end in this study. A dosage effect was implied in the sentence, \"The morticians who spent more time embalming than in general funeral work, also experienced more complaints of irritations.\" It was not clear who and how many people were in the study. Embalming agents contain formaldehyde as well as a variety of other chemicals, such as tissue moisturizers, smooth muscle relaxants, bleaches, an auxiliary antiseptic agent (phenol), dyes, buffers, wetting agents, water conditioners and/or anticoagulants, perfumes and odor suppressors, and vehicles (methanol, ethanol, and glycerine).

            "text": "Yefremov (127) studied 278 workers at two woodprocessing plants where urea-formaldehyde resins were used extensively. They reported that the incidence of chronic diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract was higher in workers exposed to formaldehyde than in a control group consisting of 200 individuals of corresponding ages. The prevalence was from 28.1 to 58.3% depending on work areas, among formaldehyde-exposed workers, compared to 13% among the controls. The highest prevalence of disease (58%) was observed in the workers at the hot press shop, where the concentration of formaldehyde was 2.5 times that in the cold press shop. Disease occurrence was 33.9% at the cold press shop. In all work areas the formaldehyde concentrations were reportedly below the max-Environmental Health Perspectives imum permissible concentration (0.4 ppm). Assuming the age-matched controls represent an appropriate comparison group (no mention was made of matching on sex and smoking history), this report supports the hypothesis that exposure to formaldehyde may lead to chronic respiratory diseases. Kratochvil (128) examined a total of 18 workers of a mean age of 35 with an average formaldehyde exposure of 7 years in a clothing production plant. Formaldehyde exposure occurred during storage and processing of fabric impregnated with ureaformaldehyde and melamine-formaldehyde resins. Catarrhal conjunctivitis was found in 72% of the workers; 28% of the workers exhibited a catarrhal inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, 22% of the workers exhibited chronic bronchitis diagnosed in accordance with the criteria of the World Health Organization, and 11% of the workers showed skin changes. Lung function tests showed that the vital capacity and the differential forced vital capacity exhibited normal values for all workers. The concentrations of formaldehyde in these work areas were below the maximum allowable concentration (0.4 ppm). In the absence of an appropriate control group, an etiologic role of formaldehyde in development of the above conditions is uncertain. In fact, the 22% incidence of chronic bronchitis among the workers corresponded to the incidence of this condition reported for a normal population of a similar age group. Shumilina (129) reported a high incidence of menstrual and reproductive function disorders among 446 women workers (130 finishers and 316 inspectors) exposed to urea-formaldehyde resins. Formaldehyde concentrations of 1.2 to 3.6 ppm were often found in the finishers' work area of the fabric trim shop, while levels from 0.04 to 0.56 ppm occurred in the inspectors' work area. A group of 200 saleswomen not exposed to formaldehyde was used for comparison. The reproductive disorders reported to be more common among those exposed included menstrual disorders, increased complication during pregnancy, and higher percentage of neonates with low birth weights. The role of formaldehyde in the development of these disorders is uncertain, however, because of the lack of information on the work environment and the socioeconomic status of the study and control groups. In addition, many of these disorders are known to be associated with physical and mental stress, personal habits (alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine consumption), nutritional status, and other factors related to the socioeconomic status of women. Still, these findings are intriguing and indicate a need for further studies in this area.",

These workers were exposed to vapors of phenol, formaldehyde, aniline, epichlorohydrin, diphenylpropyl, styrene and a combination of glass fiber and glass-reinforced plastic dust. The levels of each of these chemicals were 1.5 times the respective maximum permissible level in 63% of the samples (maximum permissible level of formaldehyde is believed to be 0.5 mg/m3 or 0.4 ppm). Among the 143 workers examined, 58 (40.5%) had psychoneurologic and sexual complaints. Sexual complaints included a diminution of libido, premature ejaculation, a weakening erection and decrease in the satisfaction derived from an orgasm. Analysis of the sexual complaints revealed a direct relationship to the duration of employment at the plant. Testicular dysfunction among the workers was also reported, including decreased volume and increased viscosity of ejaculate and decreased number of spermatozoids. The authors concluded that these sexual dysfunctions were the results of complex toxic effects of chemicals on the cells of the cortex and those of the subcortical brain stem structures, which participate in the regulation of sexual function. It is impossible to determine how much of the sexual dysfunction might be attributable to formaldehyde since appropriate control groups were not included and these workers were exposed to a variety of toxic chemicals in addition to formaldehyde. Of particular interest are reports of epichlorohydrininduced sterility in animals (131, 132) .",

A total of 50 cases of dermatitis were observed in three years (1962) (1963) (1964) (1965) among 150 employees who handled rubber weather strips coated with phenol-formaldehyde resins. The workers who developed dermatitis had been exposed to the adhesives containing phenol-formaldehyde resins for from one day to two years before the onset of the eruption, with an average period of contact of 17 weeks. The average duration of the eruption was 12 weeks, however, in three cases it persisted up to 21/2 years. The eruption was generally an erythematous vesicular rash of the fingers and hands. Three materials were handled by these employees: (1) the rubber weatherstrips, used for some years; (2) adhesive A and B introduced 4 years before in 1962 and supplied by the same manufacturers; (3) toluene, which was the solvent used to activate the adhesive. The rubber weatherstrips alone were ruled out as a cause because they came from various suppliers and had not changed in composition for a long time. The toluene would not be expected to cause sensitization within a short period of time. Among the 29 patch-tested dermatitis patients, four (14%) gave a weak reaction to phenol alone, while 65% had a positive reaction to the adhesive resins. It is, therefore, probable that formaldehyde in the resins was a causal agent. Outbreaks of dermatitis in several industries using formaldehyde resins were reported by Schwartz, Peck and Dunn (136) . In a factory where plywood was laminated, 600 cases ofdermatitis were reported among about 800 workers during the first six months of operation. In a second reported outbreak, over 40 workers out of a total of 100, developed dermatitis in a factory making tool handles from laminated glass fabric and phenol-formaldehyde resins. Although no unexposed group was available for comparison, the high proportion of formaldehyde exposed workers developing dermatitis is quite impressive.",

In addition, many studies lacked appropriate controls and/or environmental measurement, making it difficult to clearly evaluate the role of formaldehyde. Independent reports of respiratory system disorders and dermatitis among persons from a variety of work settings supply evidence on the consistency of the association, and indicate that formaldehyde is a likely contributor to the origin of these diseases. Only three studies (120, 125, 127) allowed an estimate of the strength of association between formaldehyde and respiratory disease. The risk of chronic respiratory symptoms among exposed groups ranged from about 1.5 to 4.5 times that among nonexposed groups, with little evidence of a dose gradient. The studies of dermatitis among workers exposed to formaldehyde, although reporting a high prevalence, lacked comparison populations necessary to estimate the strength of the association. Respiratory and integumentary systems are plausible response sites since workplace exposure to formaldehyde is likely to occur by inhalation or dermal contact.",

            "text": "The above studies on formaldehyde complaints are all similar and suffer the same deficiencies. None of them can be used to estimate prevalence of symptoms nor can they be used to establish doseresponse relations. These shortcomings include: (1) the surveys are conducted only among those who complain, and although the prevalence of symptoms should be high, it is a biased sample; (2) there are no controls and no measurement of other irritants that could cause health complaints. Thus, these studies are only suggestive of possible problems and by themselves provide little evidence of cause and effect relationships. Morbidity R. Levine of the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology studied approximately 100 West Virginia morticians in a cross-sectional study of lung function (spirometry) and respiratory symptoms. Employment and smoking histories were also obtained. Industrial hygiene measurements made in the mortality study of Ontario embalmers along with symptoms during embalming, number of bodies embalmed, subjective assessment of severity of fumes, and length of employment will be used to assist in the estimation of exposure in this study. Spirometry will be compared to predicted values from Knudson, and internal comparisons will be related to exposure after age, height, and smoking adjustments. Data from this study are being analyzed in terms of the prevalence of respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, dyspnea) and the relation of percentage of predicted pulmonary function to employment (formaldehyde exposure) after adjustment for confounding variables. There is no assessment of skin effects. It is not clear if acute symptoms related to exposure are to be evaluated. Although there is a good rationale for studying this occupational group, an inability to detect a significant response in this study could be due to low cumulative exposure (probably less than 8 hr/day). Length of exposure (years worked or latency) should be adequate. If we assume 50 persons each (smoking groups combined) in a high and low exposure group (the optimal situation) there is an 85% chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference in FEV between exposure groups, if the true difference is 0.5 liters and a level is 5%. If the symptom rate is 20% in the low exposure group, there is less than a 50% chance of correctly rejecting the hypothesis of no difference if the true difference is 20% at the 5% level (two-tailed test). As 160 in all cross-sectional studies, estimates of exposure are only a crude indicator of actual exposure. This is, however, one of the few studies to attempt to assess long term effects of formaldehyde on lung function. Although embalming fluid contains 1-2% formaldehyde, other pulmonary irritants are also present (e.g., phenol) but these may be at low enough concentrations to have a minimal effect. A comparison group (e.g., funeral directors) would have provided more confidence in the results and more power in the analysis.",

Information gathered by-telephone interview included type of home and insulation, formaldehyde odor, health symptoms and other medical data, demographic data on the occupants, and the period prevalence of asthmatic attacks, wheezing, chest pain, stinging or burning skin, burning or tearing eyes. Except for wheezing, the controls reported a higher prevalence of symptoms than did UF foam households. There was no detectable difference in the overall incidence of new symptoms during the year. There was, however, an association of increased symptoms and formaldehyde odor; the incidence of new symptoms following installation of the insulation was 2.7 times higher than in the months preceding the insulation. About 64% of the residents of the UF foam homes reported no problems at all related to the foam insulation. There is the possibility of selective recall in the remaining 36% of the study group because of the possible publicity relating to mobile homes and the specific questions relating to insulation. Despite this potential bias, there was little overall difference between study and comparison populations. There was, however, a doseresponse relation (dose was based on odor). Unfortunately, there were no environmental measurements to correlate with odor perception and symptoms, and apparently no control of other potentially confounding irritants other than formaldehyde. The added insulation may have also increased other respiratory irritants that could have raised the symptom rate. It is not clear how the formaldehyde odor was described to the subjects.

Some of the questions that need answering are: What are the health parameters that will be determined and how often are they being monitored? Are there formaldehyde controls for the mobile homes? If so, how are they selected? If no controls are planned, the study will have limited value. Are other respiratory irritants being measured (e.g., NO2)? About 50% of the homes are newer homes with higher formaldehyde levels than the older homes which are serving as controls and have measurable but low levels of formaldehyde. Assuming a 20% symptom rate and 180 people in each exposure group (high and low formaldehyde), there is about an 85% chance of correctly rejecting the hypothesis of no differences in symptoms when the true difference is 15% at the 5% a level, and about a 99% chance of correctly rejecting the hypothesis of no difference in FEV1 when the true difference is 500 mL at the 50% a level (two-tailed test).

Although the details are unknown, this study design does not promise to add very much to our knowledge. The power in this study is similar to the study by Woodbury and Zenz when the following assumptions are made: (1) the two exposure groups to low and high formaldehyde are of equal size ( -150); (2) the prevalence of symptoms is about 30% in low exposure group.",

The cohort is composed of Ontario's funeral service professionals licensed during . Date of birth, date of first licensure, type of license, years licensed, and place of employment are available for each person. Observed mortality rates will be compared to Canadian national and provincial mortality data. Mortality will also be analyzed as a function of exposure (years worked?). A retrospective industrial hygiene assessment will consist of inquiring about changes in funeral practices with time, surveying several selected funeral establishments. The survey will include air sampling for agents of potential health concern (e.g., formaldehyde, phenol) and examination ofpurchase records to determine amount and kind of chemicals used. Presumably these data are to be used in evaluating dose-response relationships. Assuming the study population comprises 180 deaths (15% of the estimated cohort) and a 20% cancer rate there is about a 50% chance of correctly rejecting the hypothesis of no difference if the true difference is 10% at 5% ot level (or an 85% chance if the true difference is 15% at the 5% ot level). As a group, these three studies of embalmers should provide a good estimate of potential risk from formaldehyde exposure.",

Although single epidemiologic studies usually cannot adequately assess an occupational risk, or the risk of exposure to a chemical agent, taken together these studies should help clarify the situation. There are, however, a number of concerns about these studies. * Are exposures to formaldehyde high enough in these populations to assess possible effects? For example, are embalmers exposed 8 hours/ day, 5 days/week, or is their exposure much less? * Can exposure history be adequately documented? Are individuals with little or no embalming experience distinguishable from those with considerable exposure? Since few if any of the workers are exposed only to formaldehyde, what is the effect of exposure to these other agents? * Is exposure to formaldehyde in the same range as for other populations? The confidence we place in the findings from these studies depends largely on the ability to retrospectively estimate exposure. If exposure in these occupational groups is representative of other exposed populations, the conclusions may be indicative of potential risk to all exposed populations. If these studies do not adequately address the above questions, then further investigation may be required. Such investigation may be pursued within the existing data set, or new populations may need to be investigated.",

Fifteen site visits are planned and these will be completed over the next six months. The major difficulty of the mortality studies of individuals exposed to formaldehyde is the limited ability of such studies to detect excess risk for rare causes of death. Since the known carcinogenic action of formaldehyde is limited to the nasal sinuses in rats, there is a need to evaluate the risk for this site in man, although it is clear that carcinogens may not affect the same tissues in humans as in laboratory animals. It is unlikely that a cohort of sufficient size can be assembled to accomplish this task; however, a carefully designed case-control study might.
