Gallo co-discovered the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the cause of AIDS and together with colleagues discovered one of the first cytokines (IL-2). IL-2 later became critical to growing continuous in vitro cell-lines, and is now important in many immune therapy protocols.

            "text": "Robert Gallo reviewed recent HIV vaccine trials that used four different methods. The Thai-U.S. Army trial (RV144) appeared to have given very modest protection in the early months after vaccination, while the others failed to prevent infection or in one case was associated with greater infection. Gallo explained that for the last several years, the emphasis has been on induction of antibodies to the HIV envelope component, gp120, rather than to a primary induction of cellular immunity to prevent infection. This approach was based on the logic of trying to prevent integration and establishment of a permanent infection. This effort has mainly evolved around two programs. The first was a detailed analysis of the RV144 results, particularly correlates of protection, which have mainly highlighted antibodies interacting with VIV2 gp120 epitopes and epitopes induced by gp120 interactions with CD4, referred to as CD4i Abs, which target conserved envelope regions needed for gp120 interaction with CCR5. Functional correlations were mainly with Fc effector functions rather than neutralizing antibodies (Nab). The second major approach is one that is geared toward inducing broad Nab, which is a reasonable goal, but one that is not being met, as it is proving far more difficult than supposed. Moreover, in studies in nonhuman primates (NHP), as well as the results with RV144, correlation of protection is rare with Nab, even when they are generated.",

This vaccine is in Phase I trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/ NCT02756208). Like all anti-gp120 antibodies correlating with protection, these antibodies do not persist, and attempts to increase persistence have resulted in hyper-activation of T-cells, which then form more targets for HIV infection. Persistent boosting to maintain the antibodies leads to changes in the antibody isotype, which can reduce their efficacy. Based on the RV144 trial and recent NHP studies, Gallo concluded that two critical basic science problems remain to be solved for the development of a successful antienvelope HIV vaccine: durability of the antibodies and a correct immune balance.",

Vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport is a unique mechanism for nuclear export of macromolecular complexes in which a complex in the nucleus buds through the inner nuclear membrane to form a vesicle in the perinuclear space (primary envelopment). The vesicle then fuses with the outer nuclear membrane to release the complex into the cytoplasm (de-envelopment) . This type of transport is observed in herpesvirus-infected mammalian cells for export of viral nucleocapsids, but is not common in other types of cells, indicating that herpesviruses may expropriate this mechanism (Oda et al., 2016) . However, the cellular mechanism for vesicle-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport remains largely unknown. He went on to describe recently identified host cell proteins involved in this unique nuclear export system, and how these proteins could be targets for novel anti-herpetic drugs, since this transport system is essential for the life cycle of herpesviruses and is unique in biology.",

Secretory, polymeric IgA antibodies induced by intranasal, inactivated influenza vaccine have higher neutralizing and cross-neutralizing ability against homologous and heterologous influenza viruses compare to monomeric IgA antibodies in humans (Suzuki et al., 2015) . A method of producing secretory multimeric IgA antibodies in vitro was established recently, and Hasegawa and colleagues examined the improvement of neutralizing effects by multimerization using monoclonal IgA antibodies. The method of in vitro production of multimeric IgA antibodies was established by introducing cDNA constructs of H, L, and J chains of IgA with secretory component (SC) into Expi293F cells. This method allowed production of large amounts of recombinant monoclonal polymeric IgA antibody. The antibody-coding cDNA was isolated and cloned from single plasma cell from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a subject previously vaccinated intranasally with inactivated influenza A (H5N1) vaccine. Monomeric and multimeric IgA antibody specific for influenza virus was prepared, and functional analysisdsuch as ELISA and neutralization testsdwas performed. Similar to secretory IgA antibodies in human nasal washes, the recombinant IgA showed that polymerization of the antibody molecule enhanced the neutralizing activity. Mass spectrometry analysis found that the antibodies had a molecular weight of 720 kDa, suggesting they consisted mostly of the tetramer form. These tetrameric IgA antibodies may be clinically useful as mucosal agents for the prevention and treatment of influenza.",

Long-lived infected macrophages, specifically microglia in the brain or Kupffer cells in the liver, may also play a role, though this remains controversial. On ART, HIV-specific T cells express multiple exhaustion markers, and these cells are often unable to recognize and kill infected cells due to multiple immune escape mutations that are archived in long lived latently infected cells. Furthermore, in some tissue sites such as B-cell follicles in lymph nodes, there is limited penetration of HIV-specific T-cells.",

Other interventions, including activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with bryostatin and ingenols, are under evaluation. Studies of HDACi and disulfiram have demonstrated that HIV transcription can be activated in vivo with varying efficiency, but to date there is no evidence that these interventions alone can clear latently infected cells. In addition, recent in vitro studies have shown that activating transcription with HDACi, but not other LRAs, may lead to profound changes in HIV RNA splicing, therefore limiting potency. Other concerns regarding HDACi include short-and long-term toxicity, changes in host gene expression and adverse effects on immune function. More potent and specific LRAs are necessary and in development for use alone and in combination. Additional interventions to promote cell death may be needed.",

He also noted that for cervical cancers, for which screening programs are available, it is difficult to identify the lesions likely to progress to invasive cancers. Given that only 1 in 500 HPV16-positive cervical dysplasias will eventually progress further, biomarkers clearly are needed. Tumor progression is characterized by increased expression of the viral E6 gene and E6-dependent degradation of p53, and increased expression of E7, which is known to bind and inactivate pRb; and integration of viral DNA into the host genome with the consequent disruption of the E2 viral gene (Annunziata et al., 2012) .",

In particular, predictive biomarkers are needed to detect lesions at high risk of recurrence or progression, in order to implement appropriate treatment and to avoid overtreatment of patients with a high probability of regression. To achieve such goals, expression profile analysis of p53-related genes in HPV-16-positive genital carcinomas, along with autologous nontumor tissue, was performed, and significant differences in the expression levels of genes involved in regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, proliferation and DNA repair pathways were identified. Moreover, oncogenic driver mutations in critical genes (such as PIK3CA and TP53), recurrent chromosomal gain/loss, and oncogene activation by HPV integration have all been recognized to cause deregulation of cell signaling pathways and cancer progression (Tornesello et al., 2014) . More recently, analysis of the regulatory regions of human genes encoding for cell proliferation proteins has shown a high frequency of mutations in lesions associated with less oncogenic HPV genotypes, and even in HPV-negative lesions. Validation of these candidate biomarkers is currently under way on a larger number of cases, including different grades of HPV-related neoplastic lesions (CIN1-3 and invasive cervical cancer). Such studies will contribute to the development of new tools for the identification of premalignant lesions at high risk of progression to invasive cervical carcinoma.",

Murine fibroblasts of skeletal muscles, joint capsules and dermis were found to be primary viral targets, and type I IFN-sensing, non-hematopoietic cells were critical for innate immune control. A genome-wide siRNA screen identified 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors affecting viral replication, which allowed identification of potential drug targets. Twenty-one small molecule inhibitors that affect six host pathways have been identified; three showed prophylactic effects in the mouse model. A calmodulin inhibitor (pimozide) and a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor (TOFA) showed antiviral effects in mice when used together (Karlas et al., 2016) . Other experimental data showed that CHIKV infection does not directly target the placental barrier, therefore vertical transmission from viremic mothers to neonates likely occurs via laborinduced placental breaches. CHIKV also was found to be a significant cause of CNS disease in larger human outbreaks, with the virus detected in affected tissues (G erardin et al., 2016) . Scott Weaver, Chair of a GVN task force on Zika virus (ZIKV), reviewed the sudden emergence of ZIKV from relative obscurity to global menace. Serosurveys have shown its historical incidence in parts of Asia and Africa (Weaver et al., 2016) . A widespread outbreak in the Micronesian island of Yap in 2007 later expanded to neighboring islands in South Pacific. Coincident with these outbreaks, a 20-fold higher incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was noted. The explosive outbreak in Brazil that began in 2015 and has involved millions of people has since spread to 47 other countries and territories in the Western Hemisphere. The peridomestic mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and the invasive Aedes albopictus mosquito have been identified as the major insect vectors. Surprisingly, sexual transmission of ZIKV also was confirmed in travelers returning to non-endemic regions. A most disturbing aspect of the recent outbreaks is the high incidence of fetal microcephaly and other birth defects directly related to infection in pregnant women.",

Why does the overall risk of microcephaly and other birth defects seem to differ in other parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, compared to Brazil? It appears that these new outbreaks in the Western Hemisphere have not been caused by novel viral strains. Instead, the introduction of ZIKV into na\u00efve populations via rapid global travel, the growth of tropical cities, and changing vector populations seem to have allowed virus amplification and subsequent epidemic spread. Prospects for control are dependent on mosquito control, new therapeutics and development of an effective vaccine. Vaccine prospects appear good, with about 40 candidates now in development and animal models available for preclinical testing. Two DNA-based vaccines have entered Phase I trials, and an inactivated vaccine is nearing Phase I. Deploying a vaccine, however, remains dependent on developing an accurate test for ZIKV. Current tests are hampered by antigenic cross-reactivity between ZIKV and other closely related flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, and St. Louis encephalitis, some of which are endemic in the same geographic areas.",

These databases identified 76 and 82 diagnostic amino acid sites from the ZIKV NS1 and E proteins, respectively, that distinguish it from other flaviviruses, with sensitivity/specificity above 98% (Sun et al., 2017) . Similar numbers of such diagnostic sites were also identified for other flaviviral species. Sliding window analysis revealed several contiguous peptide regions that contain multiple diagnostic sites specific for each of the different flaviviruses. These regions are now being used to develop peptide arrays for the detection of antibodies specific for each of the viruses including ZIKV. These peptide arrays could have a significant impact on diagnosis and epidemiological analysis of future disease outbreaks. Diane Griffin at the GVN center at Johns Hopkins University (USA) noted that insect-borne viruses causing encephalitis have become a global health concern due to their recent expansion into new regions. While the fatality rates vary, many patients recovering from serious episodes of viral encephalitis are likely to have lifelong physical and mental disabilities. Viral persistence and immunemediated clearance are important factors in these sequelae. Griffin described experiments with Sindbis virusda prototype alphavirusdusing a variety of mouse models (Griffin, 2016) . Infection of neurons in adult mice resulted in non-fatal encephalomyelitis. Recovery was mediated through a coordinated effort between antibody to the E2 viral surface protein and IFN-g. While IFN-g signaling leads to clinical disease via pro-inflammatory cytokines, it synergistically helps clear the virus by increasing B-cellattracting chemokine production for recruitment of antibodyproducing cells to the central nervous system (CNS). However, the non-cytolytic immune phenomenon does not lead to elimination of intracellular viral RNA from long-lived neurons, so that continued suppression of virus and the prevention of reactivation and reemergence in the CNS require immune control after recovery. Evidence was presented that B and T cells that infiltrated during the acute phase of infection remain there after recovery and continue to exert their protective effect locally. Long-term residence of these immune cells in the CNS is likely facilitated by the continued presence of viral proteins.",

While annual seasonal influenza virus vaccination is effective e albeit underutilized in most countries e a safe, universal vaccine providing broad and long-lasting immunity would represent a major breakthrough. Today's licensed vaccines focus on eliciting humoral immunity to the globular head (HA1) of the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, an antigen subject to antigenic drift, which requires continued surveillance of circulating influenza viruses.

This type of immunogen has been demonstrated to be efficacious following vaccination in mice, conferring heterosubtypic protection against virus challenge. The mechanism by which this approach confers antiviral activity suggests that redirecting immunity to the stalk region preferentially supports induction of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Data presented showed that broadly neutralizing HA stalk-specific antibodies require FcgR interactions for protection. Palese proposed a two-contact model for optimal induction of ADCC by influenza virus-specific mAbs targeting the stalk regiondand not the globular headdand he noted the importance of the HA binding to effector cells via its sialic acid receptor was required for optimal ADCC induction.

Studies of BTV in sheep offer unique perspectives for understanding the pathogenesis of arboviral diseases, as observations made in the naturally occurring disease can be effectively reproduced in a convenient experimental setting, using the same animal species (Caporale et al., 2014) . The clinical outcome of BTV infection in sheep is extremely variable, but similar to other arbovirus infections, in that a rapid onset of the antibody response correlates with a more favorable clinical outcome. BTV infection of its natural sheep host was used to examine a previously uncharacterized mechanism adopted by an arbovirus to manipulate host immunity at the early stages of infection. BTV is transported rapidly via the lymph to the peripheral lymph nodes, where it infects and disrupts follicular dendritic cells (FDC). These cells of stromal origin promote the formation and maintenance of the germinal centers in which B cells differentiate into memory cells and plasma cells, and are also responsible for supporting antibody class-switching and affinity maturation. This work showed that BTV hindered B-cell division in germinal centers, resulting in the delayed production of high-affinity and virus-neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the humoral immune response to a second antigen is also hampered in infected sheep. Thus, an arbovirus can evade the host antiviral response by inducing an acute immunosuppression. Although transient, this immunosuppression occurs at the critical, early stage of infection, when a delayed host humoral immune response likely affects the systemic dissemination of the virus and the clinical outcome of disease (Melzi et al., 2016) .",

Pathogens spilling over from wildlife reservoirs, either directly or via intermediate hosts, were the basis of most of the outbreaks. Striking examples in humans were the emergence of AIDS from chimpanzees, avian flu from migratory birds, and SARS, MERS, and Ebola virus disease from bat reservoirs. A complex mix of predisposing factors in our globalizing world, linked to major changes in the societal environment and global ecology, collectively created opportunities for viruses and other pathogens to infect and adapt to new animal and human hosts. This paved the way for the unprecedented spread of infections, with dramatic consequences for public and animal health, animal welfare, food supplies, economies, and biodiversity. It is important to realize that, because of the complex and largely interactive nature of the predisposing factors, it is virtually impossible to predict the next pathogen threat, where it will come from and when it will strike. However, a better understanding of the underlying processes may eventually lead to enhanced predictive capacity, improving preparedness for outbreaks in humans and animals. Importantly, the increased emergence of viral infections has been largely paralleled by medical, veterinary, technological, and scientific progress. Investments to better understanding human-animal interfaces should offer a future head start in the struggle against infectious diseases of humans.",

Mab 6D6 may, therefore, have potential as a therapeutic agent in animal models. He also described a novel antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism in which Fc receptor-mediated intracellular signaling increased uptake of Ebola virus into cells in vitro (Furuyama et al., 2016) . Activation of the Fc-receptor-mediated signaling pathway was essential for ADE of Ebola virus infection; this finding provides new insights into mechanisms of ADE and the development of treatments for ADE-associated diseases. Finally, he noted that neutralizing and ADE antibodies show balanced effects depending on total antibody concentration, raising theoretical concerns about the use of convalescent human sera or plasma with low antibody titers. Therapeutic treatment with convalescent sera with in vitro neutralizing activity was not sufficient to protect against Ebola virus infection in nonhuman primates (Mire et al., 2016) . It may be that ADE antibodies counterbalanced the neutralizing capacity of other antibodies. These laboratory phenomena warrant further evaluation.",

Viruses can express microRNAs that directly target cellular transcripts, while others produce long non-coding RNAs acting as microRNA sponges or epigenetic modulators. These strategies, based on ribonucleic acids, control the cell's fate without eliciting immune responses due to the absence of viral proteins. Virally encoded miRNAs were first identified in DNA viruses. Most of them are generated from endonucleolytic cleavage of long viral transcripts.
