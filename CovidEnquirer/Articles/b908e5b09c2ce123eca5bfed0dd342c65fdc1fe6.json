Majority of results show that breathing reduces inhalation quantity and the reduction magnitude increases with breathing rate. This is attributed to the fact that the exhalation process plays a more significant role in reducing the dose level than the enhanced effect during inhalation period. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper the decline of the resultant concentration would be leading to lower dose. Nevertheless, under low pulmonary ventilation, results show that breathing increases dose marginally. Results also reveals that ventilation scheme also affects the exposure.",

Measurement is commonly taken at a reference location and the concentration is considered as representative of the entire indoor microenvironment. This approach completely ignores the influence of human-generated thermal plume effects on concentration profile, which has been reported to be an important factor affecting indoor concentration [6, 7] .

MV schemes are the most popular ventilation arrangement for commercial buildings. In schemes of this type, high-velocity cooled air is discharged through supply grills and warm air is expelled through return grills. Both grills are located at the ceiling level. DIS schemes exhibit characteristics completely different from those of MV schemes. DIS schemes supply cooled fresh air at a low velocity to occupied zones through supply air grilles located at lower levels of rooms and expel hot air via exhausts located in the ceiling.",

The profiles exhibit almost a vertical drop during exhalation cycle and the rate increasing with breathing rate. Nevertheless, no profile was observed dropping to the \"theoretical\" zero BNB. This is a distinct difference between the experiments and the ideal pattern which can be plausibly attributed to limitations of the setup. Some constraints related to the experimental setup caused the ideal concentration profile (Fig. 5) to be unattainable. In the breathing circuit, a common path was used for inhalation and exhalation (Fig. 2, Path C) . Although the tubing was kept short, finite time was still required for the filtered air to purge the entire tubing. Thus a certain fraction of particles were retained inside the tube, leading to non-zero concentration during exhalation. Higher breathing rates led to higher purging rates in tubing and hence, fewer particles were retained inside the tube; concentration level dropped further. Comparison of Figs. 4 and 5 shows that the higher the breathing rate, the better the results match with the ideal breathing pattern. Table 1 also confirms that the BNB ratio is inversely proportional to pulmonary ventilation. They may be regarded as a limitation for estimation the dose during breathing. In spite of this constraint, it is believed that it did not affect results of episodic emission shown below.",

This can be attributed to the dynamic behavior of motorized valves as it takes finite time for them to open and close mechanically. More experiments to measure the dynamic properties of valves are required to confirm the hypothesis. Inferring from the results shown in Fig. 4 , the inhalation period of 2.5 s and the exhalation period of 1.5 s were assumed hereafter.

Inferring from Fig. 4 , exhalation cycles lasted less than 2 s while inhalation cycles lasted longer than 2 s. Hence asymmetrical cycling time was adapted for Fig. 6 . The modified cycle of 2.5 s inhalation and 1.5 s of exhalation matches well with measured concentration profile. Fig. 6 (a) shows a single peak profile and the concentration starts to decline when the inhalation cycle begins. On the contrary, Fig. 6 (b) shows a double peak profile and it seems it was counter-intuitive as there was only one peak in the non-breath profile. It was attributed to occurrence of inhalation-exhalation during incoming of the aerosol cloud. The existence of the double peaks and the timing of decline and rise of peaks match very well with the breathing pattern. This shows that breathing can drastically alter the concentration profile (and concentration).",

In Fig. 8 , although each of the three measured concentration profiles show double peaks, the profiles are very different from each other as the second peak occurred at different times, early, middle and later. It is plausible to attribute this to interaction of the incoming aerosol plume with respect to the various instantaneously breathing cycles. The differential time from the first peak to the local minimum is shown in the figure and they are all approximately 1.5 s. This observation shows how the starting time of exhalation affects the ultimate concentration profile at the mouth. Similar observations were found in the MV scheme. Fig. 9 depicts another comparison between three concentration profiles sampled with active breathing and one profile without breathing. It can be observed that each peak was substantially higher than that without breathing, with the peak-to-peak ratio ranging from 1.3 to 1.6.",

Profiles with breathing were observed to have sharp dips at the beginning of the decay part but the decay slowed afterwards (see the insert in Fig. 9 ). This can be explained by commencement of the exhalation cycle, which accelerates the decay, whereas the beginning of the inhalation cycle leads to slower decay. This observation was very different from the profile of the non-breath system in which concentration drops gradually to the background level. Fig. 10 further quantifies effects of pulmonary ventilation on the decay. Three profiles of different pulmonary ventilations are shown in Fig. 10 . The insert in Fig. 10 shows the decay part of the profiles in detail; best-fitted exponential decay rates are shown.

            "text": "It should also be noted that different profile characteristics are exhibited and the most remarkable one is the existence of the second peak. Fig. 11 shows two concentration profiles of 15 m/s emission velocity and pulmonary rate of 7 LPM under DIS scheme to illustrate how they influence on dose. It can be observed that when the double peak concentration profile (Trial 1) started to decline, concentration profile of the single peak (Trial 2) continued to rise. ventilation schemes. Owing to the large variation in concentration profiles (e.g., Fig. 7) , it can be seen that the ratio varies significantly when the breathing system is applied (for instance, see Fig. 11 ). Detailed comparison of Figs. 12 and 13 reveals that the maximum to minimum ratio increases with pulmonary ventilation, i.e. 2.9-6.4 times for 7 LPM to 23 LPM, respectively, for the MV scheme, and 1.6-1.9 times for the DIS scheme. The variation of ratio under the MV scheme is larger than the DIS scheme. Under the MV scheme (Fig. 12) , high-velocity, high-turbulence supply air disturbs the aerosol-laden jet from the expiratory source. Nevertheless, this would not be the case in the DIS scheme, where low-velocity airflow is not expected to disturb the aerosol-laden jet. Thus, the results under the MV scheme fluctuate more and a larger range of variation was caused. Fig. 14 summarizes BNB ratio for mode values for all tested scenarios. The ratio is inversely proportional to the pulmonary rate, regardless of the ventilation mode and emission velocity. This is attributed to the influence of the exhalation process. Under light physical activities where pulmonary ventilation equals 23 LPM, exhalation process plays a significant role in reducing the inhalation level. It overwhelms the enhanced inhalation in the process. The higher the breathing rate, the sharper the resultant drop of concentration would be, leading to lower the dose. However, it is possible that dose would be increased under very low and low pulmonary ventilation, where some results show BNB ratios higher than 100%. This may be attributed to the effect of dose reduction is smaller for very low and low pulmonary ventilation and, therefore, the reduction of dose caused by the exhalation process was not high enough, compared to the enhancement of the dose during inhalation. Besides, the BNB ratio under the MV scheme is lower Fig. 14. Breath to non-breath ratio of scenarios for the mode value. than that of the DIS scheme under the same emission velocity and pulmonary ventilation.",
