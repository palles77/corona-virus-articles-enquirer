            "text": "In order to test the hypothesis that a putative co-factor for the development of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in pigs could be of viral origin, we performed extensive virological examinations on organ material from pigs diagnosed with PMWS originating from within a Danish PMWS-transmission study. Virus isolation attempts were carried out on a large panel of different cell types including primary pig kidney cells and lung macrophages, primary rabbit kidney cells and seven established cell lines (MARC-145, ST117, PK15, BHK21, HeLa, Vero, and MDCK). Although these represent cells with susceptibility to a wide range of known viruses, the results did not provide evidence for a specific virus other than PCV2 contributing to the development of PMWS. Furthermore, in order to test whether specific genotypes of PCV2 may trigger the switch from PCV2 infection to clinical disease, we compared complete DNA genome sequences of PCV2 derived from PMWSpositive as well as PMWS-negative pigs. On the basis of the DNA sequences, the PCV2 isolates were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisting of one isolate originating from a herd unaffected by PMWS, with group 2 consisting of nine isolates originating from four PMWS-affected herds, four PMWS-positive pigs plus one unaffected herd. The PCV2 genomes from the two groups showed 95.5% identity. Alignment analyses of the sequences encoding the replicase and capsid protein from group 1 and group 2 PCV2 isolates showed two amino acid differences encoded in the replicase protein, while 19 amino acid differences were predicted among the capsid protein sequences. The PCV2 DNA sequence analysis supports recent observations from studies in USA as well as Europe, which suggest that strain variations may influence the clinical outcome of PCV2 infection. #",

The disease is characterised by a constellation of clinical signs including wasting, jaundice and respiratory disease with increased mortality in growing pigs between 5 and 14 weeks of age (Harding and Clark, 1997) . PMWS was first reported from high-health herds in Canada in 1991 (Clark, 1997) . Since then, the disease has spread worldwide (Allan et al., , 1999a Ellis et al., 1998; Onuki et al., 1999; Choi et al., 2000) . In Denmark, almost all swine herds are positive for antibodies against PCV2, thus indicating the widespread occurrence of PCV2 in Danish pigs. On the other hand, the observation that only some herds experience clinical problems with the disease (Vigre et al., 2005) suggests a complex etiology.",

In order to test the hypothesis that a putative co-factor could be of viral origin, we performed extended virological examinations on organ material from pigs diagnosed with PMWS originating from a Danish PMWStransmission study (Kristensen et al., 2004) . This study wished to investigate whether healthy pigs from herds unaffected by PMWS would develop PMWS after close contact with pigs which displayed clinical symptoms of PMWS. Two to four weeks after mingling, clinical symptoms of PMWS were observed in pigs from the PMWS-unaffected herds, indicating that the disease complex had been transmitted from diseased to healthy individuals. Our efforts to identify and characterise a viral co-factor in PMWS were based on virus isolation attempts and electron microscopic examination of tissue material from a number of these pigs which became PMWS-positive after mingling.",

Using different selected cell types and culture conditions, a diverse range of cell culture environments for virus propagation was provided. The cell panel represented various target tissues for porcine viruses together with receptors for a wide range of virus families. A wide variety of cells including epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages were represented. In addition, na\u00efve as well as transformed cells were included. Furthermore, the use of two stages of cell confluence, 50-75% and 100%, respectively, at the initial seeding of the tissue material, attempted to take into consideration the different replication properties of specific viruses, e.g. Table 4 Amino acid differences in the replicase and in the capsid protein, respectively, between PCV2 isolates from groups 1 and 2 that various viruses require cells at different stages of the cell cycle to replicate. On the basis of this extensive examination, we conclude that (i) The isolation of PCV2 from the examined organ material was expected and supports the pig selection criteria, which included the presence of PCV2. (ii) PRRSV was isolated from one pig as well. This result was not surprising, as it is well known that PRRSV and PCV2 infection often co-exist in individual animals Wellenberg et al., 2004; Vigre et al., 2006) . (iii) We did not find any evidence for the presence of a specific virus that triggers PMWS. Despite the use of a wide array of variable cell culture monolayers for propagation of a putative cofactor, no candidate could be found. The sporadic staining observed in some of the first passage cultures remains obscure, since further passages did not reveal the nature of this staining. In order to strengthen our attempts to identify a hitherto undetected virus, we used a broad range of different antibodies (Table 1) . Specifically, a difference in staining pattern between anti-sera originating from herds unaffected by PMWS versus PMWS-affected herds could give interesting information, since a specific virus would be expected to stain with sera from PMWSaffected herds, but not with sera from PMWSunaffected herds. Although no such difference was observed, the involvement of a yet unknown virological factor cannot be completely excluded, as alternative cell culture conditions may have been necessary for virus propagation. Finally, it may be speculated that a co-factor important for initiation of PMWS could be present only in the early phase of the infection and then be degraded or otherwise eliminated when clinical and pathological manifestations are evident.",

We found the PCV2 isolates to be divided into two groups (Table 4) : group 1, consisting of one isolate, originating from donor herd 1 (a herd unaffected by PMWS) and group 2, consisting of all isolates from PMWS-affected herds (herds A, B, C, D), donor herd 2 (another unaffected herd) and all individual pigs examined, i.e. the pigs from healthy donor herds which became PMWSpositive after contact with pigs from one of the PMWS-affected herds. Comparison of the genomes showed that all sequences obtained from PMWSaffected herds shared an almost identical PCV2 nucleotide sequence (99.6% to 100% nucleotide identity) whereas the relationship to the healthy donor herd 1 was less close, about 95.5% nucleotide identity. The donor herd 2 sequence (a herd unaffected by PMWS) did not fit into this pattern as it showed a PMWS-linked PCV2 sequence. However, since this herd experienced clinical problems consistent with PMWS about 3 months after initiation of the transmission study, it may be speculated that this herd was not truly PMWS free at examination, explaining the PMWS-linked PCV2 sequence in this herd.",

Thus, the amino acid sequence found in our group 2 is identical to the amino acid sequence found to be linked to PMWS in the Swedish study whereas the amino acid sequence found in group 1 is identical to the Swedish non-PMWS linked sequence.",

We speculate that the PMWS-linked PCV2 strain (group 2) binds more effectively to the host cell surface and therefore outcompetes PCV2 isolate 1 found in herd 1. The level of pathogenicity of the PMWS-linked PCV2 strain may possibly be connected to this observation. However, this needs to be investigated further.",

This observation indicates that if strain variation is important for development of disease, it is likely that the capsid protein is responsible for the pathogenicity but this remains to be established. Furthermore, we identified a deletion in the nucleotide sequence of the capsid-gene from group 2. The loss of a single nucleotide a the 3 0 terminus of the capsid protein coding sequence does not influence the length of the capsid protein. Instead, the change results in incorporation of asparagine as the second last amino acid in the capsid protein instead of lysine. Asparagine is an uncharged, polar amino acid, whereas lysine is a positively charged, polar amino acid. Whether different properties of these two amino acids are important to the function of the capsid protein is unknown.",

The immediate discrepancy between these observations and our results may be related to various factors, e.g. different criteria for defining a herd as PMWS-positive. Recently, Olvera et al. (2007) demonstrated that phylogenetically PCV2 genomes can be divided in two major groups defined as PCV2 groups 1 and 2. Although none of those could be associated with disease status, the definition of two groups of PCV2 as such supports our indications of the existence of two groups in our study. Thus, groups 1 and 2 in our study match PCV2 groups 2 and 1, respectively, by Olvera et al. (2007) . A similar observation was made by Cheung et al. (2007) , who further demonstrated a pattern in phylogenic match and disease. They found that the American PCV2 group 1 isolate was detected in all PMWS-diseased animals, while only two of the diseased animals harbored the PCV2 group 2 isolate.",
