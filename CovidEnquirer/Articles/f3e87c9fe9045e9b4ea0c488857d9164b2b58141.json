We were confronted by this question after a decade of research on what was termed, according to Fenner, \"slow virus infections.\" Progressively, we evolved toward the idea of virus infections with a delayed pathology. The main effort during this period was to study how, and in which form, virus information persisted in cells and in the organism. More recently, in view of the results from our group and from the literature, we began to evaluate critically whether the continuing presence of the virus was always necessary for the appearance of the pathological phenomenon. Last year we published an article with the provocative title, \"Virus Disease without Virus,\" to present the concept that viruses may play a triggering role for several clinical manifestations, even after the virus has been eliminated (Huppert and Wild, 1984) .",

If cell death does not ensue, the alterations may affect the regulation of gene expression. Repair of chromosomal translocation is a infrequent event. By analogy to this situation, the continuing presence of chemical mutagens or carcinogens is not necessary for the transformed state. Once the agent has produced its effect on the cellular genome, its phenotypic manifestation will depend on the altered expression.

At this point, the immunological system may intervene limiting the further spread of virus. During the viremia, a number of cell types will come in contact with the virus, but the ability to infect the cells will depend upon the tropism of the virus. Thus, viruses multiplying in lymphatic cells (measles) or adhering to these cells (reovirus) may have the possibility to pass into the brain.",

The majority of infections are asymptomatic, but in certain cases the virus may generalize and pass into the nervous tissue. Here, the virus can infect neurons which will not be replaced. Depending on the involvement of the nervous tissue, a state of paralysis may ensue. The direct loss of irreplaceable nervous tissue is responsible for the pathological lesion. This persists after the virus has been eliminated. Certain other virus infections do not fall into the above categories. They have either adapted their replication to avoid immunological elimination, or their multiplication is modified by a combination of events. In these systems, the virus may remain in the host cells, either latently or as a persistent infection. In the case of RNA viruses, it has been shown that the less selective environment of a nonlytic system permits the accumulation of mutations in the virus which are normally lost in the lytic system (Holland et al., 1982) . During the evolution of the infection these mutations may give rise to proteins which may be rapidly degraded or can no longer function biologically.",

The most frequently observed lesions are chromosome breaks and pulverization. These typically appear early in infection, and surviving cells present either a normal karyotype or translocations, but not breaks. However, we should remember that a great part of these studies were done before the chromosome banding techniques were in general use. Therefore, translocations may have been seriously underestimated and restricted to situations where a characteristic \"marker\" chromosome could be identified. Chromosomal rearrangements are certainly of greater biological significance then breaks or pulverizations. Whereas the latter modifications are lethal, chromosomal rearrangements are not and are permanent. Breaks and gaps precede rearrangements but, as they have to be repaired, this can only occur in cells which retain the ability to synthesize proteins and DNA. In the presence of chemical inhibitors of DNA synthesis, only open chromosome breaks are seen. However, after the removal of the inhibitor, chromosomal rearrangements appear (Nichols and Heneen, 1964) .",

Allison and Paton (1965) proposed the breakdown of lysosomes followed by liberation of enzymes, especially nucleases, to be the main mechanism. In careful experiments, Aula and Nichols (1968) compared infection of measles and polioviruses (the latter producing lysosomal breakdown but few chromosome changes). They followed lysosome integrity by measuring the release of acid phosphatase. No correlation was found between the amount of enzyme liberated and chromosome alteration. Furthermore, addition of cortisone, known to stabilize lysosomes, did not prevent chromosome alteration. Sablina (1978) showed that chromosome aberrations of HSV-infected permissive and nonpermissive cells depend on DNases of both lysosomal and virus origin. Most hypotheses generally accept that the inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis by virus infection, or competition for precursors, is a plausible explanation. Hand (1976) showed that in mouse L cells infected with mengovirus or NDV, 5 hours after infection, DNA synthesis was normal despite a marked inhibition of r3H1thymidine incorporation. Later, replicative fork progression was slowed down and the number of initiation events decreased. Shelton et al. (1981) have found that one of the reovirus nonstructural proteins binds t o DNA and may interfere with chromosome function in the infected cell. Bellett et al. (1982) reported that actively growing rodent cells infected with human ADV 5 suffer various types of chromosomal damage. ADV uncouples DNA replication and polyamine synthesis. Addition of spermine or aminoguanidine (an inhibitor of diaminoxidase which prevents polyamine catabolism) prevents chromosome damage if added up to 1.25 hours before mitosis. It may be relevant to this that G. A. Quash (personal communication) has found that malondialdehyde (produced by polyamine oxidation) specifically interacts with nucleotides.",

To answer this question, Homma et al. (1968) used HeLa cells persistently infected with type 2 hemadsorption virus (a variant of Sendai) and which have a characteristic karyotypic modification. When HeLa cells were infected with this virus, nearly all the metaphase cells at 40 hours after infection had the modified karyotype characteristic of the persistently infected line. Schwobel et al. (1977) and Epplen et al. (1977) studied BHK cell lines persistently infected with Sindbis, NDV, vaccinia, or pseudorabies viruses. Each of these cell lines presented a decreased modal number of chromosomes. R and Q banding revealed specific chromosomal markers for each of the infected lines. A subline of bhe Sindbis virus persistently infected cells became virus free after 4 years of subculturing. This subline conserved the characteristic modified karyotype. Infection of this cell line with any of the above-mentioned viruses readily gave rise to a persistent infection. Wild et al. (1981) found that BGM cells persistently infected with measles virus had a modified karyotype and several biochemical modifications, especially in phospholipids (this is described in another section of this review).

Their hypothesis is based on observations that most viruses induce a strong T cell response, resulting in activation of virus-specific helper T cells (Mims, 1982) . These factors can induce polyclonal B cells to proliferate and secrete antibody (Dutton, 1975; Altman and Katz, 1982; Muraguchi et al., 1983; Howard and Paul, 1983) . The nonspecific B cell growth and differentiation factors have no or little effect on resting B cells, but they can activate cells previously primed with an antigen. At any given time, there are a number of such cells sensitive to the nonspecific lymphokines released by activated T cells. Thus, B cells may be activated indirectly during the infection.",

While this may be optimized against such invaders, the immunological system may mediate a hypernormal response to environmental antigens that cross-react with self antigens, giving rise to an autoimmune disease. In this respect, it has been possible to associate certain mouse and human histocompatibility antigens with autoimmune disease. The alleles DR 2, 3, and 4 are primarily associated with the conditions of hyperthyroidism and myasthenia gravis, where the antibodies are directed against thyroid-stimulating hormone and acetylcholine receptors, respectively. Whereas there is no direct evidence that viruses may play a role in the selection of variant immunologically competent populations, natural history may provide some indirect proof. Large variability in susceptibility or resistance to infectious diseases exists among genetically heterogeneous individuals in natural animal populations. The grouping based on these differences can often be equated to the same animal species located in separate geographical regions (Biozzi et al., 1984) . Although nonimmunological factors may also be involved, it has been clearly demonstrated that the principal functions of the immune system are subject to polygenic quantitative regulation since they can be drastically modified by bidirectional selective breeding (Biozzi et al., 1980) . It may, therefore, be possible that viruses exert selective pressure on the genetics of the host's immunological system.",

They have shown that inoculation of newborn Swiss mice with less than 88 ngtday of interferon for 7 days was lethal . The livers from these animals were filled with fat vesicles and had decreased glycogen. There were no inflammatory infiltrates (Gresser et al., 1975,19811 , but an inhibition of the maturation of different organs was apparent. Inoculation of a tenth of the lethal dose did not retard growth; however, glomerular lesions appeared from the twentieth day, even though the interferon treatment had stopped at the seventh day. The glomerular lesions were progressive and were followed (several days to weeks) by the deposition of IgG and C3 along the glomerular basement, similar to that observed in \"immune complex\" nephritis (Gresser et al., 1976) . Subsequent work with highly purified material has shown that interferon can produce glomerular lesions as early as the fourth day .

It is now well established that certain of the arenaviruses, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, give rise to persistent infections in a variety of hosts, and high levels of interferon may be associated with these infections. Newborn mice infected with LCM virus rapidly develop a persistent infection. The surviving mice develop glomerulonephritis. If anti-interferon antibody is administered at the time of infection, despite 100-fold increase in virus production, there is no kidney damage or thickening of the glomerular basement membrane .",

Viruses are still the best inducers of interferon, and the production of interferon appears to be an integral part of the host response to virus infection. So, can levels of interferon be used as a diagnosis for chronic infections? Serum interferon levels may be elevated in certain chronic diseases, such as that in NZB/W and MRL mice, which develop an autoimmune disease like SLE (Skurkovich et al., 1981) . Inoculation of type 1 or 2 (y) interferon into these mice increased the incidence of anti-erythrocyte, anti-SS DNA, and anti-soluble nucleoprotein antibody, and increased the severity of renal lesions (Sergiescu et al., 1979; Adam et al., 1980; Engelman et al., 1981) . In man, increased interferon titers have also been described in autoimmune disease (Skurkovich and Eremkina, 1975; Hooks et al., 1979) . Further, the state (active/inactive) of the disease could be correlated with the presence of interferon (Preble et al., 1982) .",

In this case, there is a large reduction in the accumulation of intracellular cAMP following isoproterenol stimulation of P-adrenergic receptors . Both measles and rabies viruses belong to the group of \"enveloped\" viruses, which integrate their glycoproteins into the cell plasma membrane. Can these foreign glycoproteins play a primary role in the dysfunction of the specialized membrane cellular function, by their mere physical presence in the membrane? Barret and Koschel (1983) have shown that addition of specific virus antiserum to C6 cells persistently infected with measles virus leads to a gradual loss of virus membrane antigen. This was accompanied by the recovery of the catecholaminedependent p-adrenergic receptor-stimulated cAMP synthesis. They concluded that the impairment of this cell function was due to the insertion of viral antigens in the cell membrane, rather than their accumulation in the cytoplasm.

Removal of the antibody leads to the reexpression of the virus antigens. When the cells were cloned after antibody treatment, although the cell clones were initially negative for measles virus expression, one third became positive when cultivated for periods up to 9 months. Of the remainder, half could be induced to express virus antigens, whereas the remainder could not. In similar experiments with cells of non-nervous tissue origin, HeLa and Vero, despite modulation of the expression of virus surface antigens, Barrett et al. were unable to suppress the synthesis of internal virus antigens completely.

They gave rise to persistent infections with either the wild type or virus originating from the persistently infected culture. In contrast, the same viruses gave lytic infections in the parental L cells. The cured cell lines were morphologically distinct from the parental line, being larger and less fibroblastic-like. They had an altered cytoskeleton and contained a large number of lysosome-like structures in the cytoplasm. Unlike the parent line, the cured cells were also resistent to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. There are further examples in which uninfected cells derived from persistent infections have altered susceptibility to virus infection; e.g., HeLa cells derived from carrier cultures of poliovirus or Coxsackie A9 virus infections are more resistent to superinfection than the parental line (Ackerman and Katz, 1955; Vogt and Dulbecco, 1958; Takemoto and Habel, 1959) .",

Brain tissue from the obese mice showed no overt pathology and virus could not be detected in this or other tissues. The levels of dopamine and norepinephrine were two to three times lower in obese mouse brain than in controls (Lyons et al., 1982) .

He found an increase in several diseases (immunoreactive, degenerative diseases of bone and cartilage, and certain tumors) in the section of the Danish adult population which had a history of inapparent measles infection in childhood. These obviously represent one end of the spectrum. Presumably, further advances may be made by studying intermediate situations, in which persistent virus infections are established.
