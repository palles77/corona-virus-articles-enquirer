In this study, an ACE gene (LsACE) from the small brown planthopper was found to respond to Rice stripe virus (RSV) infection. The enzymatic activities of LsACE were characterized at different pH and temperature. Twenty planthopper proteins were found to interact with LsACE. RSV infection significantly upregulated LsACE expression in the testicle and fat body. When the expression of LsACE in viruliferous planthoppers was inhibited, the RNA level of the RSV SP gene was upregulated 2-fold in planthoppers, and all RSV genes showed higher RNA levels in the rice plants consumed by these planthoppers, leading to a higher viral infection rate and disease rating index. These results indicate that LsACE plays a role in the immune response against RSV transmission by planthoppers.",

The mammalian ACE is best known for its role in the renin-angiotensin system, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure homeostasis (Bernstein et al., 2013) . Angiotensin I is converted to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II by ACE through the cleavage of a C-terminal dipeptide of angiotensin I. Apart from this, ACE takes part in thermoregulation (Schwimmer et al., 2004) , hematopoiesis (Hubert et al., 2006) , and immune responses (Bernstein et al., 2013) . The mammalian ACE has two distinct isoforms, i.e., a double-domain somatic form and a single-domain testicular form (Bernstein et al., 2013) .",

This virus is efficiently transmitted by the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus in a persistent-propagative manner (Falk and Tsai, 1998) . The genome of RSV contains four RNA segments. RNA1 is negative-sense and encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The other three segments are ambisense and encode NS2, NSvc2 (putative membrane glycoprotein), NS3 (gene silencing suppressor), CP (nucleocapsid protein), SP (disease-specific protein), and NSvc4 (movement protein) (Cho et al., 2013) . As a persistentpropagative plant virus, RSV has a limited replication level in the vector insect under the surveillance of the insect immune system, such as pattern recognition molecules, immune-responsive effectors, reactive oxygen species, and the Toll pathway (Zhao et al., 2016 (Zhao et al., , 2019a . In addition to these well-known immune pathways, the ACE gene of L. striatellus (LsACE) was found to response; its transcript level was upregulated in viruliferous planthoppers (Zhang et al., 2010) .

The molecular weight of the His-tagged recombinant protein was 79.5 kDa ( Fig. 2A) . The hydrolysis activity of LsACE from FAPGG to FAP and GG was measured based on standard curves (Fig. 2B) . The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was over 0.98 for each standard curve. In the pH range from 4.0 to 12, the enzyme activity increased from 2.0 U/L at pH 4.0-8.6 U/L at pH 6.0 and then dropped at pH 7 (Fig. 2C ). LsACE maintained a high activity between 7.2 U/L and 9.2 U/L in a range of temperatures from 20\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C, while the activity remarkably decreased at 40 or 45\u00b0C (Fig. 2D) . Thus, the optimal pH and temperature for LsACE activity were pH 6.0 and from 20\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C, with the best activity at 25\u00b0C.

The expression of LsACE is activated by RSV, and the increase in LsACE is not in favor of the viral infection, as shown by inhibited viral SP expression. Cytoplasmic viral inclusions comprise SP that directly interacts with the ribonucleoprotein particles of RSV; the knockdown of SP expression significantly limited the spread of RSV in the infected insects . In our study, overexpression of SP due to the knockdown of LsACE in planthoppers led to a more serious disease incidence in rice plants, suggesting a higher viral transmission efficiency from vector insects to host plants. Therefore, the immune function of LsACE may be embodied in blocking the RSV spread in vector insects. In contrast, the SARS coronavirus and avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H7N9 share a common regulation on the mammalian renin-angiotensin system, namely, the elevation of angiotensin II levels in parallel with reduced ACE2 and sometimes enhanced ACE activities (Kuba et al., 2005; W\u00f6sten-van Asperen et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014) . The plasma level of angiotensin II is strongly correlated with the disease severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Angiotensin I is cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II and is further converted to angiotensin 1-7 by ACE2 (Imai et al., 2010) .

As a member of the M2 metalloprotease family, ACE is usually involved in the digestion of small hormonal peptides and neuropeptides, such as leucokinin, locustatachykinin, and allatostatin in insects (Lamango et al., 1997) . We identified 20 proteins that putatively interact with LsACE. Of these proteins, several were associated with immune and inflammatory reactions. Kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase 3 (EC 2.6.1.7), also known as kynurenine aminotransferase III, is a component of the kynurenine pathway that is partially involved in neuroactive and immunomodulatory metabolites (Asp et al., 2011) . The DnaJ-like protein subfamily A member 2 is generally considered a potential target of the immune response in rheumatoid arthritis (Kotlarz et al., 2013) . AMP deaminase 2 regulates the accumulation of extracellular ATP, which provokes pro-inflammation and immune effects in systemic lupus erythematosus (Guo et al., 2018) . The RR1 cuticle protein 2 precursor may take part in viral transmission because the homologous cuticle proteins in the small brown planthopper (CPR1) and in the aphid Schizaphis graminum were found to be involved in the viral transmission process (Liu et al., 2015; Cilia et al., 2011) . The macrophage migration inhibitory factor has a central role as a regulator of innate immune and inflammatory responses in human sepsis and other inflammatory diseases (Baumann et al., 2003) . Considering that these proteins are not small peptides, we suggest that LsACE directly binds these proteins to affect their functions instead of cleaving them. One or more immune pathways could be targeted by LsACE.",

Although both ACEs have the HExAH active site motif, recombinantly expressed D. melanogaster AnCE3 does not show enzymatic activities using Hip-His-Leu or Locustatachykinin-1 as substrates (Isaac et al., 2007) , while LsACE is able to cleave the C-terminal dipeptide of FAPGG. The K m value of LsACE towards FAPGG is 36.1 \u03bcM, reflecting a high affinity to this substrate, compared to the K m of 2200 \u03bcM with the substrate Hip-His-leu and 420 \u03bcM with the substrate Hip-Phe-Arg for the mammalian somatic ACEs (Cheung et al., 1980) . The optimal pH for LsACE activity is 6.0, an acidic condition, while the optimal pH for an ACE homolog of Musca domestica is 8.2, an alkaline condition (Lamango and Isaac, 1994) . LsACE maintains high activity in a broad temperature range from 20\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C, which adapts to the seasonal temperature variations in temperate and subtropical East Asia where the small brown planthoppers distribute. The transcript level of LsACE was normalized to that of the elongation factor 2 transcript and was represented as the mean \u00b1 SE. Differences were statistically evaluated by Student's t-test to compare two means. *, P < 0.05.",
