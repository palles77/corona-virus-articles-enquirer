Another variant utilizes methylethylketone and CaCO 3 8 while other references describe condensation promoted by triethylamine in acetic acid. 9 Examples of aniline acylation in acetate buffer 10 and aqueous K 2 CO 3 11 are also known, while another approach proposes the synthesis of 2-chloroacetanilides in base-free conditions. In the latter case, the reaction takes place in nonpolar solvent 12 or in a mixed solvent system. 13 Although there are many options available, it is important to note that most of these methods suffer from numerous side reactions arising from either N-quaternization of the organic base or hydrolysis, which lead to low yields and tedious work-up procedures.

The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at rt and then evaporated to 1/3 volume. Hexane (30 mL) was added and the mixture was kept overnight in a refrigerator",
