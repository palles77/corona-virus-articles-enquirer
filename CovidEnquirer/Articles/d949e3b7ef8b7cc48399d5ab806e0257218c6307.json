RNA structure can be studied using lowthroughput techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. More recent approaches have started to exploit biochemical reactions to perform high-throughput profiling of the RNA structure: Parallel Analysis of RNA Structure (PARS) distinguishes doubleand single-stranded regions using the catalytic activity of two enzymes, RNase V1 (able to cut double-stranded nucleotides) and S1 (able to cut single-stranded nucleotides) (3, 4) , while Selective 2 -Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) (5,6) employs highly reactive chemical probes such as 1M6, NMIA (SHAPE) and NAI-N 3 (icSHAPE) to characterize RNA backbone flexibility. Another technique based on dimethyl sulfate (DMS) (7) is often used for in vivo probing of transcriptomes (8, 9) . DMS experiments are of high quality due to the smaller size of the (CH 3 O) 2 SO 2 probe, yet have low coverage, since the alkylating agent only reacts to adenine and cytosine.",

We searched the positive and negative fragment sets extracted from icSHAPE-Mouse and PARS-Human data for sequence patterns (Supplementary Table S9 ) using DREME (Materials and Methods: Sequence patterns) (19) . In icSHAPE-Mouse sequences, the G/GC/ACGU/GC motif occurs with frequencies of 63% and 43% in the positive (556 645 fragments) and negative (355 740 fragments) sets (Supplementary Table S9 ), indicating poor discrimination. As for PARS-Human, the top motif in the positive fragment set GCU/GC/AG/G (71% frequency) is also non-specific (frequency of 47% in the negative set). This observation indicates that the neural network approach is particularly suitable to identifying complex patterns in biological sequences, which is key to discover trends in large data sets (20) . We also note that CROSS models are sensitive to single point mutations: the signal drops progressively upon insertion of random mutations in the original sequences (PARS-Yeast; Supplementary Figure S7 ).
