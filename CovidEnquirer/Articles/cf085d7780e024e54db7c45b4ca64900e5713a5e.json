Manufacturing was controlled by a common master production batch record, standard operating procedures that included acceptance criteria for deceased donor organ pancreata and critical raw materials, PHPI product specifications, certificate of analysis, and test methods. The process was compliant with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and Current Good Tissue Practices. This report describes the manufacturing process for 75 PHPI clinical lots and summarizes the results, including lot release. The results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a harmonized process at multiple facilities for the manufacture of a complex cellular product. The quality systems and regulatory and operational strategies developed by the CIT Consortium yielded product lots that met the prespecified characteristics of safety, purity, potency, and identity and were successfully transplanted into 48 subjects. No adverse events attributable to the product and no cases of primary nonfunction were observed.",

            "text": "Previous clinical trials assessing treatments for unstable type 1 diabetes have demonstrated restoration of pancreatic b-cell function by allogeneic islet transplantation (1-4). In 2000, the University of Alberta reported that transplantation of allogeneic purified islet products resulted in sustained C-peptide levels, improved glycemic control, and prevention of hypoglycemia in seven subjects with type 1 diabetes (5) . The results were later confirmed by Brennan et al. (6) in a multicenter trial reporting the 12-year follow-up of seven subjects. One subject experienced graft failure 10.9 years post-islet transplantation. The remaining six continued to have sustained C-peptide levels and improved glycemic control. No episodes of severe hypoglycemia, opportunistic infections, or lymphomas were reported. Although significant progress has been made since the initial trials, development pathways for cellular therapy have required convergence toward regulatory guidelines on clinical trial design. Manufacturing differences at the various processing facilities prevented comparison of clinical results across centers, making it difficult to derive overall conclusions and limiting islet transplantation use in medical practice. Factors affecting the quality of islet products, including organ donor acceptance criteria (7, 8) , organ recovery techniques, cold ischemia time (9) (10) (11) , organ preservation and transport solutions (12, 13) , and methods for islet isolation (14) , purification, and culture, have been previously reported (15) (16) (17) .",

Each manufacturing facility was responsible for its own quality control, quality assurance, and compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and Current Good Tissue Practices. The CMC MC provided further quality oversight by qualifying the manufacturing facilities for study participation and conducting batch record reviews. Assays used to determine product viability (fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide [FDA/PI]) (33, 34, 37) , identity/quantity (dithizone [DTZ]) (35) , and biological potency (glucose stimulated insulin release [GSIR] by ELISA) (41) were qualified at each facility before that facility's participation in the trial. Manufacturers were required to meet the predefined assay acceptance criteria for accuracy, precision, selectivity, sensitivity, and reproducibility of each assay.

If the combined total settled tissue volume was #7.5 mL, all purity fractions were pooled into a single infusion bag. If the total settled tissue volume was .7.5 and #15 mL, the tissue was divided into two or three infusion bags, with a maximum tissue volume of 7.5 mL/bag. The pooled tissue for each infusion bag was allowed to sediment, washed, and resuspended in 100 mL CIT Transplant Media (40) .

The median total PHPI dose per subject was 11,972 IEQ/kg (range 5,227-25,553 IEQ/kg), with 42 of 48 subjects achieving clinical success (18). Each of the 75 PHPI lots was released for transplantation in 1 (n = 54), 2 (n = 20), or 3 (n = 1) infusion bags.

Median viability was 94% (6%) in the high-purity sample, and the median GSIR stimulation index was 2.3 (1.6) ( Table 4 ).

The CIT efforts resulted in the successful identification and testing of new enzyme blends by the manufacturing centers. The results presented here show that the enzymes used in digestion yielded lots that met the product specification and, therefore, could be used in manufacturing the PHPI product. During the trial, potency was assessed by viability and identity of islets as determined by FDA/PI (33, 34, 37) and DTZ stain (35) , respectively. The CMC MC developed and standardized a GSIR by ELISA (41) for quality control and as an in vitro assay for potency assessment of PHPI products.
