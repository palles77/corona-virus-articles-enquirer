The physicians of the participating units were requested to provide information, filling in a data form, which included for each patient, the items considered by the Chopard and Kucher score systems [1, 2] as well as by the recommendations of the ACCP08; in addition, also the single bed rest criterion was considered [3] . Seven hundred forty-two forms (84.8%) contained all the requested information and were included in our analysis. The percentage of patients considered at risk by the 4 methods was markedly different. The Kucher and Chopard score systems, respectively, considered 12% and 55% of our patients at increased risk; intermediate values were found using the ACCP08 criteria (16%) and immobilization (29%). The different percentage and distribution of patients considered at risk by the different systems are well displayed in the Venn diagram ( Fig. 1) , which shows that the Chopard score comprises all subjects meeting the ACCP08 and Kucher criteria and part of those immobilized.",

States were asked to provide supporting documentation to substantiate each response. Reviewers examined the submitted documentation and assigned a score for each question based on the criteria shown in Table 1 . Scoring consisted of an ordinal scale describing the level (or completeness) of response for each state's submitted documents and their appropriateness in supporting the activity addressed. Although these results detail preparedness efforts prior to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, information collected post-2009 H1N1 indicates that these results are still valid [12] . However, these data fail to characterize 9-1-1 preparedness. Furthermore, the role of EMS in the 2009 H1N1 response was limited to assisting with vaccination efforts [13, 14] .",

Ensuring EMS workforce health and minimizing health risk is essential to supporting their role in mitigating and responding to an infectious disease outbreak.

This exclusion, coupled with technological enhancements and a heightened awareness of the public safety benefits of emergency call centers, have led to recommendations that call centers be included in emergency response planning, and that policymakers enact processes to integrate 9-1-1 with emergency response programs [27] . As 9-1-1 technologies have advanced, many have realized the potential benefit of integrating 9-1-1 into a wider emergency communications safety net.

Furthermore, communication problems can adversely affect patient outcomes, even resulting in death [28] .

This underscores the need for response agency participation from the early stages of planning, and a clear understanding of the roles and expectations during an incident. This study's finding that only 13.3% of states had complete plans delineating the role of 9-1-1 during a pandemic further demonstrates the absence of 9-1-1 from emergency planning. Many transports to Emergency Departments (EDs) are for non-emergency problems [30] [31] [32] [33] .

Utilizing a triage and classification system can reduce the number of EMS responses, transports, and ED visits, and without adversely affecting patient outcomes [34] . The implementation of a medically safe and appropriate emergency number triage system will be critical to a state's ability to reduce the anticipated surge of requests for both prehospital and hospital care during a severe pandemic. Once triaged, a 9-1-1 caller may be directed to varying options for assistance given locally available resources, including instructions for home care; referral to a primary care provider, to community services (e.g., poison control), or to urgent care clinics. Furthermore, a PSAP triage and classification system can effectively guide EMS equipment and transportation resource usage, thereby lessening the drain on EMS resources during a patient surge [35] . The absence of telephone triage protocols to guide 9-1-1 callers to alternate call centers represents a potentially missed opportunity to consistently and systematically decrease the demand for EMS and ED services during a severe pandemic.",
