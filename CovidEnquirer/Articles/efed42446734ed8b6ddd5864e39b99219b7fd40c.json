The Iridoviridae are large, cytoplasmic DNA viruses with an icosahedral outer capsid, an internal lipid membrane, and an electron-dense core containing a circularly permuted double-stranded DNA genome (209 kbp). CIV infects a wide range of insects (Williams et al., 2005) , replicates productively in the cotton boll weevil Anthonomus grandis (Henderson et al., 2001) , and induces metamorphic arrest and mortality in this host (McLaughlin et al., 1972) . Earlier work showed that UV-treated CIV or viral \"soluble\" protein extract inhibited host protein synthesis in mosquito cells (Cerutti and Devauchelle, 1980) . Recently, our group showed that a CIV virion protein extract (CVPE) induces mortality in neonate boll weevil larvae (Bilimoria, 2001) and apoptosis in spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana and boll weevil cell cultures (Paul et al., 2007) .",

These include caspase activation, cytoplasmic shrinkage, phosphatidylserine exposure, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and cell blebbing (Hay and Kannourakis, 2002) . Apoptosis proceeds through signal transduction pathways, usually involving activation of cysteine-aspartate-specific proteases, i.e., caspases. Various signals activate initiator (apical) caspases, which then trigger effector (executioner) caspases. In Drosophila, one mechanism includes interaction of Eiger (invertebrate tumor necrosis factor ligand) with the wengen membrane receptor. This leads to activation of JNK, which then triggers the central initiator caspase DRONC, instigating a cascade triggering the effector caspase Drice and ultimately apoptosis (Igaki et al., 2002) . The Eiger-wengen mediated pathway appears to be the invertebrate equivalent of the \"extrinsic\" pathway found in mammalian systems. Alternate induction mechanisms in Drosophila include activation of DRONC through ER stress or through bcl-2-type stimulation and could represent invertebrate equivalents of \"intrinsic\" pathways. Induction of apoptosis in uninfected Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) cells appears to involve the equivalents of mammalian apical caspase and caspase-3 (Manji and Friesen, 2001) as initiator and effector caspases, respectively.",

Infected cells were incubated at 28\u00b0C as well as 21\u00b0C for 24 h and observed for cell blebbing. Fig. 1 shows that CIV XS induced 70% blebbing (A), whereas CIV induced 10% blebbing and 55% lysis in these cells (B). Lysis was indicated by the presence of cell debris. CIV UV (10 \u03bcg/ml) induced 62% blebbing and 5% lysis in CF cells (C). Mocktreated cells incubated at 21\u00b0C or 28\u00b0C did not undergo significant blebbing or lysis (D).

Pancaspase inhibitor reduced blebbing as follows: CIV XS -induced by 93% ( Fig. 2A) , CIV UV -induced by 97% (Fig. 2B ), CVPEinduced by 99% (Fig. 2C ). To establish whether the apoptotic pathway in this system requires an apical caspase, CF cells were pretreated with Z-IETD-FMK (a mammalian caspase-8 inhibitor shown to inhibit lepidopteran, Sf-caspase-X) (Manji and Friesen, 2001) prior to challenge with CIV XS , CIV UV or CVPE. The results show that Z-IETD-FMK blocked apoptotic blebbing by at least 97% for CIV XS (Fig. 2A) ; 96% for CIV UV (Fig. 2B) ; 96% for CIV UV ; and 98% for CVPE (Fig. 2C ). Mock treatment with RBSS yielded less than 2% blebbing (Fig 2D) . These results suggest that apoptosis induction in CF cells by high-dosage CIV, CVPE, and UV-treated CIV is dependent on Sf-caspase-X-like activity, which we have designated C. fumiferana initiator caspase (Cf-caspase-i).",

Moreover, inhibition of viral protein synthesis enhances CIVinduced apoptosis, suggesting that CIV gene expression is required for suppression of apoptosis. To determine if viral early gene expression blocks apoptosis induction upon CIV infection, we pretreated CF cells with aphidicolin (5 \u03bcg/ml) (D'Costa et al., 2001) or with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA; 200 \u03bcg/ml) prior to infection. Fig. 9 shows that CIV infection induced only 2% blebbing in the presence of aphidicolin and 1% blebbing with phosphonoacetic acid pretreatment compared to 10% during CIV infections of untreated cells. Thus, blebbing levels are significantly lower under conditions permitting only early gene expression compared to those allowing both early and late gene expression. Late gene expression down regulates many early genes in CIV (D'Costa et al., 2004) , which probably leads to the observed 10% enhancement of blebbing. Fig. 9 also shows that inhibition of viral DNA replication in CIV infections where CIV UV or CVPE had been added as apoptosis inducers resulted in similarly drastic reductions in apoptotic blebbing. Cells challenged with CIV and CIV UV together (data not shown) manifested blebbing in 65% of the cell population, probably due to an overwhelming dose of viral proteins. Reciprocal experiments involving CVPE treatment for 1 h followed by CIV and PAA resulted in 40% blebbing and 35% cell lysis, probably due to excessive dose of viral proteins (data not shown). These Parallel cultures of cells were pretreated with ammonium chloride (AC; 10 mM) and bafilomycin A (Bf; 1 \u03bcM) for 30 min prior to CIV (10 \u03bcg/ml) infection, infected with CIV (10 \u03bcg/ml), or mock-treated with RBSS. Cytopathic effect (CPE) monitored was hypertrophy, syncytia formation, granularity, or lysis. Cells from parallel cultures were harvested at 48 hpi and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond).

            "text": "Since CIV early gene expression blocked apoptosis, it was important to determine the effect of this temporal phase on apical caspase activity (putative Cf-caspase-i) vital to apoptosis induction in this system (Figs. 2, 3) . Therefore, we assayed Cfcaspase-i activity in CF cells at 24 h post-infection (or treatment) under conditions allowing early but not late viral expression. Fig. 10 shows that significant levels of apical caspase activity were detected in CIV infections with or without inhibition of early gene expression with cycloheximide (CHX-CIV; CIV) and in cells treated with CIV virion protein extract (CVPE). On the other hand, when phosphonoacetic acid restricted viral expression to early genes, CIV infection suppressed Cf-caspase-i activity to mock infection levels ( Fig. 10 : CIV-PAA). Challenge of CIV-PAA with CVPE did not induce Cf-caspase-i activity ( Fig. 10 : CIV-PAA-CVPE), indicating strong inhibition of this pathway by viral early gene expression. Cf-caspase-i activity was very low at 3 h post-CIV infection ( Fig. 10 : CIV-3HPI), which is within the immediate-early phase of the CIV replication cycle (D'Costa et al., 2004) . On the other hand, Cf-caspase-i activity 3 h after CVPE treatment was high (Fig 10: CVPE-3HPT ). Cf-caspase-i levels at initiation of infection or treatment were at mock infection levels. These data strongly suggest that one or more factors expressed during the early temporal phase of the CIV gene expression program inhibit Cf-caspase-i activity.",

Binding of CVPE and CIV UV to polysterene beads did not present steric hindrance problems as determined by the ability of virion-associated kinase activity to phosphorylate at least one cellular polypeptide.

A putative apical caspase designated Sf-caspase-X is inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK in S. frugiperda cells (Manji and Friesen, 2001) . Our data show that Z-IETD-FMK also blocks CVPE-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3) and suggest that CVPEinduced apoptosis in C. fumiferana cells is mediated through a putative apical caspase, designated C. fumiferana initiator caspase (Cf-caspase-i). There is some evidence that caspase-8 homologue (DREDD) and FADD homologue (DFADD) detected in Drosophila may be contributing to the apoptotic process in insects (Chen et al., 1998; Hu and Yang, 2000) ; however, this is not firmly established. On the other hand, it is well established that DRONC plays a central role in Drosophila apoptosis as well as metamorphosis and could well be the common conduit for all caspase-dependent apoptosis in insect systems (Waldhuber et al., 2005; Hay and Guo, 2006) . It should also be noted that CVPE as well as CIV induce metamorphic arrest and mortality in the cotton boll weevil (Bilimoria, 2001 ). Fig. 9 . Effect of early viral gene expression on apoptosis induction by CIV UV and CVPE in CF124T cells. Late gene expression in CIV-infected CF124T cells was blocked by inhibiting viral DNA replication with 5 \u03bcg/ml aphidicolin (APH) or 200 \u03bcg/ml phosphonoacetic acid (PAA). Viral early gene expression was permitted for 6 h after infection with CIV (10 \u03bcg/ml), and cells were challenged with CIV UV (10 \u03bcg/ml) or with CVPE (10 \u03bcg/ml). Cells were then incubated at 21\u00b0C and observed for apoptotic blebbing 24 h after initial treatment or infection. MOCK: untreated cells; APH/PAA: cells treated with aphidicolin or phosphonoacetic acid, respectively; CIV UV /CVPE: cells treated with CIV UV only (A1, B1) or with CVPE only (A2, B2); CIV-APH/PAA and CIV UV /CVPE: cells pretreated with APH or PAA, infected with CIV, then challenged with CIV UV (A1, B1) or CVPE (A2, B2) at 6 hpi. Results presented are means of 3 separate experiments in which 100 cells from 5 random fields were counted. Error bars represent standard deviations. Given this and the relationship between the JNK pathway and DRONC in Drosophila, we postulate that Z-IETD-FMK suppresses apoptosis in the CIV-CF cell system by inhibiting putative DRONC-like Cf-caspase-i (Fig. 11) .",

            "text": "We have provided strong evidence suggesting inhibition of apoptosis by one or more viral early gene products. CIV virion protein extract (CVPE) and UV-irradiated CIV induced strong apoptosis as observed by blebbing and TUNEL assays, but induction of apoptosis with infectious CIV was muted. Induction by CVPE, CIV UV , or CIV in the presence of CHX suggests that CIV gene expression or DNA replication was not required for apoptosis (Figs. 1, 2, and 7) . Suppression of apoptosis under conditions that permit early but not late gene expression (Fig. 9) and enhancement of apoptosis under conditions that block early gene expression (Fig. 10 ) further support these findings. Muted apoptosis with infectious CIV (Fig. 7) may be due to expression of iap-like genes documented in the CIV genome, viz ORF 157L (L), ORF 193R (IDL), ORF 332L (IL), and ORF 284R (L) (Jakob et al., 2001; D'Costa et al., 2004) . The first three of these ORFs are similar to iap genes in Cydia pomonella granulosis virus (CpGV; (Crook et al., 1993) and have the following motifs, respectively: ring finger, BIR repeat profile, and bipartite nuclear localization signal. ORF 284R is similar to an ASFV gene coding for a polypeptide (p27) with an IAP domain (Chacon et al., 1995) and is expressed exclusively at late times in CIV infections (D'Costa et al., 2004) . The temporal status of ORFs 157L, 193R, and 332L are not known, but published data do not preclude an immediate-early status for ORF 193R or ORF 332L (D'Costa et al., 2004) . IAP genes, dIAP 1-3, are described in Drosophila where they inhibit caspase-9 homologue, DRONC, and Drosophila tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1, dTraf1. Our data do not preclude early expression of a CIV gene product other than iap that inhibits apical caspase activity and either blocks apoptosis or recruits cellular factors for this purpose (Saito et al., 2006) .",

However, upon infection with CIV, this response is rapidly and significantly inhibited by viral early gene expression. Excessive viral load overwhelms control mechanisms, resulting in profuse, immediate apoptosis. Fig. 11 depicts a working model incorporating our data. This is the first report showing that endocytosis and JNK-like activity are essential components of the apoptotic pathway in a member of the family Iridoviridae and that apoptosis in this virus group is suppressed by early viral expression. This is also the first report of JNK signal requirement during apoptosis induction by an insect virus.",
