Extensive areas of the plasma membrane surface consist of lipid rafts organized into cholesterol-rich microdomains involved in signal transduction, protein sorting, membrane transport and in many processes of viruses infection. Because of the extraction of cholesterol leads to disorganization of lipid microdomains and to dissociation of proteins bound to the lipid rafts, we investigated the effect of cholesterol depletion by methyl-\u2424cyclodextrin (M\u2424CD) on caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV.1) in three important phases of virus infection such as binding, entry and post-entry. M\u2424CD treatment did not prejudice virus binding to cells, while a dose-dependent reduction of the virus yield was observed at the virus entry stage, and 30 mM M\u2424CD reduced infectivity evidently. Treatment of MDBK after virus entry revealed a moderate inhibitory effect suggesting that cholesterol is mainly required during virus entry rather than during the post-entry stage. Alteration of the envelope lipid composition affected virus entry and a noticeable reduction in virus infectivity was detected in the presence of 15 mM M\u2424CD. Considering that the recognition of a host cell receptor is a crucial step in the start-up phase of infection, these data are essential for the study of CpHV.1 pathogenesis. To date virus receptors for CpHV. 1 have not yet been identified and further investigations are required to state that M\u2424CD treatment affects the expression of the viral receptors.",

            "text": "Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV.1) is associated with two different syndromes in goats, depending on the age of the animals at the time of infection. In 1-or 2-week-old kids, CpHV.1 may cause a generalized lethal disease affecting mainly the digestive tract. In adult goats, clinical manifestations involve the respiratory or the reproductive tract according to the site of virus entry, although CpHV.1 infects preferentially the genital mucosa. Following primary genital infection, CpHV.1 replicates in the mucosal epithelium and spreads to sacral ganglia where establishes latent infections (Tempesta et al., 1999) . Members of the Herpesviridae form a large and various family of virus comprising three subfamilies designated alpha-, beta-, and gamma herpesviruses. Based on its antigenic and genetic properties, CpHV.1 belongs to the cluster of ruminant alpha-herpesviruses closely related to bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV.1) (Thiry et al., 2006) . Virions are composed of a large DNA genome encased in an icosahedral capsid, which is in turn coated with a layer of proteins called the tegument, and in an envelope composed of about a dozen viral proteins and glycoproteins in a lipid bilayer. All herpesviruses have a relatively broad host range for cultured cells, at least for entry. The obvious interferences are that each of these viruses can use multiple cell surface receptors for entry or that each can recognize structural features of receptors conserved among human and animal species (Spear et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "The four essential glycoproteins are thought to act in concert to induce fusion of the viral envelope with a cell membrane. Cell entry receptors are required to trigger this fusion, and the viral ligand for all known Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) entry receptors is gD. This summary of requirements for entry can be applies to animal alpha-herpesviruses as well, including pseudorabies virus (PRV) and BoHV.1. The molecule that HSV glycoproteins associated with is not necessarily a protein. It could be a lipid moiety since the virus can associate with lipid vesicles that contain no proteins (Bender et al., 2003; Spear et al., 2006) . Most, but not all herpesviruses, a notable exception is Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), make their initial contact with cells by binding viral glycoproteins to glycosaminoglycans, usually heparan sulfate, on cell surface proteoglycans. This binding to heparan sulphate, that greatly increases the efficiency of viral entry, may not be essential for virus infection and can be mediated by viral glycoproteins. Shukla and Spear (2001) supposed that interactions of one or more viral glycoproteins with cellular receptors could trigger envelope-membrane fusion or cellto-cell fusion. Based on these data several studies were focused on the identification of the viral and cellular domains involved in the interaction of virus and cell. For both alpha-herpesviruses and gamma-herpesviruses, binding to cells can be mediated by a virion glycoprotein that is not essential for entry. Entry requires interaction of a viral ligand with another cell surface receptor. The entry receptors discovered to date fall into three classes (Spear et al., 2000) . They include herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (nectin-1 and nectin-2), two members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and specific sites in heparan sulfate generated by certain isoforms of 3-O-sulfotransferases (Spear et al., 2000) . For HSV, virion gD is the ligand for several cell surface receptors (HVEM, nectins, 3-Osulfated heparan sulfate), any one of which can mediate entry. The entry process has been studied in detail in many herpesviruses, and in particular the interaction of HSV and PRV with cellular receptors. Spear and Longnecker (2003) have analyzed the interaction of HSV gD with an entry receptor to justify viral entry or cell fusion. The binding of gD to one of its receptors results in a conformational change in gD, enabling its interaction with gB or gH-gL and activation of fusogenic activity. Probably gD is not an integral component of the basic fusion machinery. Moreover, receptors for gB and/or gH-gL may exist, and binding of either to these receptors could also trigger fusion activity, by-passing the requirement for gD. These observations emerge in part from results obtained with PRV, that can use several human and animal members of the nectin family as entry receptors. Also, one of the gamma-herpesviruses, Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), has been shown to require only gB, gH, and gL for cell fusion, although the possible potentiating activity of other viral proteins has not been ruled out (Pertel, 2002) . The entry receptors in epithelial cells have not yet been identified but could include integrins. The viral ligands could be gH and/or BMRF2. For HHV-8 entry, gB can bind to one of the integrins. Any one of these interactions of a viral ligand with an entry receptor is thought to activate the fusion activity of gB and gH-gL (Spear and Longnecker, 2003) .",

The \"lipid raft hypothesis\" proposes that cell membranes are organized into distinct cholesterol-rich microdomains that are important for signal transduction, protein sorting, and membrane transport (Brown and London, 1998; Ikonen, 2001; Chung et al., 2005) . Lipid rafts, enriched in glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol and associated proteins, play a critical role in different biological aspects of the life cycle of different viruses and in particular, they are involved in many processes of viruses infection (Pratelli and Colao, 2015) . The tight packaging of the sphingolipids is maintained by the presence of cholesterol, a major constituent of the lipid rafts, and several proteins partition into these membrane domains (Imhoff et al., 2007) . Since lipid rafts are rich in sphingolipid and cholesterol, they are resistant to detergent extraction, which is usually the method of choice to separate physically lipid rafts from other membrane components. On the contrary, the methyl-\u2424-cyclodextrin (M\u2424CD), a derivative of a cyclic oligomer of glucose with a lipophilic property (Pitha et al., 1988) , extracts cholesterol out of membranes, disrupts lipid raft formation on cells, and consequently blocks biological processes that depend on lipid rafts (Chung et al., 2005; Pratelli and Colao, 2015) .",

Cyclodextrins (CDs) are a family of cyclic oligomers of glucose, that differ in the number of glucose units in the ring, i.e. they are composed of six, seven or eight glucose units in \u2423-, \u2424or \u2425-CD, respectively (Beseni\u010dar et al., 2008) . They are highly hydrophilic molecules that can bind and thereby solubilize hydrophobic molecules (Irie et al., 1992) . Derivatives of CDs, which are more soluble and less toxic, were in use in pharmacological research for years as carriers of lipophilic drugs and more recently were employed in studying the effect of both cholesterol depletion and lipid raft disassembly. \u2424-CD and its derivative, methyl-\u2424-CD (M\u2424CD) are mostly chosen for these studies as it extracts membrane cholesterol very efficiently and only negligibly binds other lipids (Beseni\u010dar et al., 2008) .",

For this purpose, MDBK cells were infected with CpHV.1 for 1 h and, after cell-bound virus inactivation, the cells were treated with 30 mM M\u2424CD for 30 min (test 1) and incubated for 48 h. Test 1 compared to the treatment before virus entry (control 2) revealed a moderate but noticeable inhibitory effect, anyhow suggesting that cholesterol was mainly involved during CpHV.1 entry in MDBK cells rather than during the postentry stage (Fig. 5) .",

The drug was then removed from each suspension by ultracentrifugation and the infectivity was determined by virus titration assay. As showed in Fig. 6a , the exposure of CpHV.1 to M\u2424CD resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the virus infectivity and at a concentration of 15 mM M\u2424CD, virus yield suffered a noticeable reduction. The inhibitory effect of M\u2424CD on the viral envelope was partially restored by cholesterol replenishment. The data reported in Fig. 6b demonstrated that 500 g/ml of exogenous cholesterol re-established partially virus infectivity, confirming that CpHV.1 envelope cholesterol was also required for virus infectivity.",

The involvement of these specific membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and (glyco) shingolipids in virus entry, assembly and budding was demonstrated both through the localization of the viral structural proteins and through the effects of lipid rafts-disrupting agents in the replication processes of several viruses (Suzuki and Suzuki, 2006) . Recent studies demonstrated that lipid rafts play a critical role in the process of viral infection. The involvement of membrane lipid rafts in the entry of non-enveloped viruses was demonstrated for simian virus 40 (SV40), rotavirus, echovirus type 1, enterovirus, rhinovirus and human adenovirus subgroup C (Suzuki and Suzuki, 2006) . The essential role of the cholesterol in the replication cycle was also clearly established for many enveloped viruses, and accumulating evidences suggest that enveloped virus entry may require cholesterol in either of the two membrane involved, or in both (Pratelli and Colao, 2015) . Cholesterol in both cellular and viral membranes is required for BoHV.1 infection (Zhu et al., 2010) , and cell membrane cholesterol is required during virus entry for other viruses in the alfa-herpesvirus subfamily. In particular, HSV entry was inhibited by cholesterol sequestering drug in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibitory effect was fully reversible by cholesterol replenishment (Bender et al., 2003; Rahn et al., 2011) . Desplanques et al. (2008) demonstrated that cholesterol is important for PRV infectivity and stability. Infectivity of Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) was sensitive to agents that disrupt lipid rafts by removing cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner and exerted these effects on both target cell and viral membranes. No effect of cholesterol depletion, however, was seen on viral binding (Hambleton et al., 2007) . Inhibitor studies further support a role for the fusion process during Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) entry, suggesting that the cholesterol present in the viral envelope is a key component in viral entry (Huang et al., 2006) . Comparative analysis of the lipid compositions of Cyprinus herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), a member of the new Alloherpesviridae virus family in the Herpesvirales order, and common carp brain (CCB) membrane fractions revealed strong similarities between the lipid composition of the CyHV-3 and CCB lipid rafts. A recent study demonstrated that cholesterol-rich lipid rafts are important for the CyHV-3 replication cycle especially during entry and egress (Brogden et al., 2015) .",

Through separate analysis of three important phases of virus infection such as binding, entry and post-entry, a different requirement of cholesterol in cellular and viral membranes for a productive CpHV.1 infection was observed. Interestingly, the cholesterol sequestering drug M\u2424CD under the experimental conditions employed, did not prejudice CpHV.1 binding to MDBK cells. On the contrary, cell membrane cholesterol was required for CpHV.1 replication at the virus entry phase, and a dose-dependent reduction of the virus yield was observed after M\u2424CD treatment. To corroborate that the decrease in the infectivity was the results of the cholesterol depletion, plasma membrane was replenished with exogenous cholesterol and the inhibitory effect was reversed. The requirement for host cholesterol during post-entry step was also evaluated and MDBK cells were treated with cholesterol sequestering drug after virus entry. The analysis revealed that virus replication was inhibited, but comparing this reduction with control 2 (cells pre-treated with M\u2424CD and then infected) the effect was moderate, suggesting that cholesterol is mainly required during virus entry rather than during the postentry stage.",

Enveloped viruses assemble their capsids in the cytoplasm and then become enveloped by budding from the plasma membrane or into cytoplasmic membranes. Viruses that assemble their capsids in the nucleus have the fundamental problem of transporting capsids across the nuclear membrane. Relatively small non-enveloped viruses, such as polyomaviruses, can move through nuclear pores, while larger non-enveloped viruses, such as adenoviruses, disrupt the nuclear envelope. Herpesvirus capsids are too large to move through nuclear pores and, consequently developed a rather complex process of maturation. The virus promotes primary envelopment of capsids by budding at the inner leaflet of the nuclear membrane and translocation of capsids into the cytoplasm after loss of the primary envelope by fusion with the outer leaflet of the nuclear membrane. Once released in the cytoplasm, non-enveloped capsids acquire a secondary envelope by budding into vesicles of the trans-Golgi network and these mature virions are then secreted from cells (Mettenleiter, 2002) . However, the intracellular distribution of cholesterol is not uniform, with a major fraction displayed in the plasma membrane (Lange, 1991) , resulting in part from its close association with sphingomyelin.",

            "text": "Another point of reflection arises from the results reported in the present study. The cholesterol-sequestering drug inhibited CpHV.1 infection, underlining the requirement for both host and viral cholesterol. As observed for HIV.1 (Popik et al., 2002) it is possible to suppose that virus and/or cellular receptors are associated with lipid rafts. Recognition of a host cell receptor by a virus is the first and perhaps the most crucial step in initiating the disease process. The cellular receptors of several enveloped and non-enveloped viruses was identified and most of these receptors are glycoproteins, although viruses can use lipids or carbohydrates. Heparan sulfate and the new receptors identified by expression cloning will be referred to as coreceptors for entry because, in general, alpha-herpesvirus entry is facilitated by, if not dependent on, interactions of viral proteins with at least two, perhaps more, cell surface receptors (Spear et al., 2000) . For instance, alteration of the lipid composition of the plasma membrane can modulate CD81dependent HCV entry into host cells. Consequently, the depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane or the alteration of the sphingomyelin/ceramide ratio of the plasma membrane, affects HCV entry by reducing the cell surface expression of the tight-junction protein CD81 (Kapadia et al., 2007; Popescu et al., 2014) . Unfortunately, virus receptors for CpHV. 1 have not yet been identified. Until their identification, it is premature to state that M\u2424CD treatment affected the interaction between CpHV.1 and the cellular receptors or affected the expression of the receptors, but it could be a suitable and assessable theory to support in the future.",
