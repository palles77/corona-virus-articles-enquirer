However, cough is also the most frequent symptom of acute respiratory system diseases and is the most common reason why sick patients visit physicians. The largest diagnostic group associated with chronic cough is asthma or asthma-like syndromes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, gastroesophageal reflux, rhinitis/postnasal drip syndrome and unpleasant side effects accompanying the therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) represent other causes of chronic cough. The cough reflex may be elicited by the activation of receptors of non-myelinated nociceptive Ad-fibers and C-fibers and receptors of myelinated Ad-fibers distributed throughout the respiratory tract. In recent times as proper cough receptors are thought to be rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) of myelinated fibers, C-fibers and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) localize on the non-myelinated fibers.",

The defense of the respiratory system against inhaled particles and gases involves the integration of many complex physiological, biochemical and immunological processes that interact directly with the properties of inhaled materials (Korpas and Tomori, 1979) . The various defense mechanisms are integrated to provide local degradation and detoxication, as well as mechanical elimination of both exogenous substances and products of pathological processes from the airways. The most important defensive reflex of the airways is cough, which, together with the mucociliary transport system, forms the main mechanism for cleaning of the respiratory tract (Korpas and Nosalova, 1991; Chung and Chang, 2002; Belvisi and Geppetti, 2004) . Korpas and Tomori (1979) characterized the cough reactions as an attack of powerful expiratory efforts produced by active contractions of the expiratory muscles, preceded by deep inspirations. The violent expiration, which provides the high flow, helps to shear away mucus and remove foreign particles from the larynx, trachea and large bronchi.",

In the absence of abnormal sputum production there is likely to be another reason for cough.

Cough prevalence in populations depends on smoking prevalence and on the level of air pollution. Statistical data are in the range of 5-40% (Fuller and Jackson, 1990; Irwin and Madison, 2002; Wright et al., 2004) . Cough is a common complaint of patients presenting to primary care physicians. Most patients with acute cough have self-limited illnesses like common cold and influenza. Gwaltney (1997) showed that the viral infections represent the most frequent causes of self-limited cough. These viruses include rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and influenza virus. These viruses can cause a spectrum of diseases including common cold, acute infections bronchitis, bronchiolitis and bacterial pneumonia. According to Gwaltney (1997) the highest incidence of cough occurred in patients with influenza (reaching 70% on day 3 of the illness) and rhinovirus colds (approximately 35% over the 7-day period of illness). Antitussive drugs such as codeine and dextromethorphan are among the most commonly used prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in the world (Choundry and Fuller, 1992) . The widespread use of antitussive medications for the treatment of cough associated with upper respiratory tract infection generates many millions of dollars for the pharmaceutical industry (Eccles, 1996) . In the UK, the cough/cold market accounted for \u00a3350 million, whereas in the USA, well over $2 billion was spent on OTC medicines (Morice, 2001) . These facts demonstrate the vast socio-economic consequences of acute cough.",

Coughing is a reflex activity initiated by stimulation of sensory nerves in the lining of the respiratory passages, the tubes we use to breathe. Coughing can be induced from the larynx and tracheobronchial tree, but not directly from structures above or below these sites (Widdicombe, 1998) . In a healthy man, cough is present only when, for example, an insufficiency of mucociliar apparatus and alveolar macrophages prevents them from fulfilling their cleaning role in airways.

From our long-standing results we can conclude that the influence of antitussive agents varies very strongly.

The stimulation of bronchial C-fiber receptors can cause cough, as well as apnea and bronchoconstriction, presumably in response to different varieties or concentrations of stimulants. All the stimuli used for irritation of C-fiber receptors can also activate RARs. Many cough-inducing chemical stimuli (like bradykinin, sulfur dioxide and capsaicin) may act directly on the RARs, but in addition they can activate C-fiber receptors, which release tachykinins. These will in turn act on postcapillary venules, causing plasma extravasations and stimulation of adjacent RARs. The increase in interstitial liquid volume might also affect the structure of epithelium and stimulate the branches of RARs there (Widdicombe, 1995) . In recent times TRPV1 receptors have been identified on Ad nociceptive fibers, which under normal physiological conditions do not synthesize neuropeptides, but can be activated by capsaicin. Reynolds et al. (2004) suggested that C-fibers do not incite cough per se but might be involved in the sensitization of the cough reflex.",

Vagal afferents have been shown to contain mediators such as glutamate and 5-hydroxytryptamine. It is also a wellknown fact that NMDA receptors, opiate receptors and 5-HT receptors are able to modulate transmission through the nucleus tractus solitarius. This region is anatomically adjacent to the area postrema, where the blood-brain barrier is weak or absent, so antitussive drugs given peripherally could be acting at the central site, on the sensory side of the system. Other areas, such as nucleus ambiguus and dorsal vagal nuclei, also contain these types of receptors and could be considered as additional sites of action. Apart from this, activation of NMDA receptors and both the opioid and serotonergic systems can modify the central respiratory network . This is also supported by our results with substances known for their ability to influence these receptors ( Figure 2 ; Nosalova, 1998) . The antitussive actions of these agents may occur via this respiratory action (Kamei, 1996) . Despite huge endeavors of experimental researchers, all of the neurochemical processes participating in the mechanism of action of antitussive agents are still not known. Hedner et al. (1980) highlight an important role of gamaaminobutyric acid (GABA) in tonic modulation of respiratory activity. As the breathing and cough centers are tightly associated, we decided to verify the ability of gabaergic substances to influence the cough reflex. We obtained original priority results (Nosalova et al., 1986a (Nosalova et al., ,b, 1987 , which support the statement that gabaergic substances are able to suppress cough ( Figure 3 ) and that gabaergic mechanisms can take part in mechanism of action of other cough-suppressing agents.

Pathological cough (especially its chronic form) has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life, observed either in physical activity or in the psychosocial domain. Coughing patients suffer often from insomnia, exhaustion, nausea and emesis, worsening of performance at work or incontinence. In many of them it can lead to social problems connected to the need for changing or leaving a job or important social activities (Irwin, 2001) . In addition to this, the intrathoracal pressure changes during the cough (inspirium \u00c013 kPa and exspirium +30 kPa) can cause costal fractures, cough syncope, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, herniation, etc. Patients with coronary lesions may experience anginal pain. Cough also represents one of the ways for transmission of infections (Korpas and Nosalova, 1991) . The most frequent cause of abnormal cough reaction is the presence of pathological processes in the respiratory system, leading to increased irritability of afferent nerve endings or increased sensitivity to different stimuli (Schuligoi et al. 1998; Shinagawa et al., 2000) . These conditions can be found during inflammatory diseases of upper and lower airways of either viral or bacterial origin.",

Stimulation of these nerves causes a constellation of responses known as neurogenic inflammation. Distribution of substance-P-containing nerves is close to that of the RARs mediating cough in the airways (Hay, 2001) . The most important enzyme for the breakdown of SP in these nerve fibers has been found (Sekizawa, 1996) . Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is a key enzyme in the degradation of tachykinins in the airways. This enzyme is strongly expressed in epithelial cells (Barnes, 2001) .

SP stimulates mucus secretion from submucosal glands and mediates the increased plasma exudation and the vasodilator response to tachykinins. Tachykinins also enhance cholinergic neurotransmission by facilitating acetylcholine release at cholinergic nerve terminals and by enhancing ganglion transmission (Watson et al., 1993) . A variety of species, including human tachykinins, stimulate C-fiber receptors and rapidly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors and can cause cough (Widdicombe, 1996) .

In the initial phase it is non-productive (dry), but it can later change into a productive one. Its duration is usually several days and it weakens gradually. This kind of cough often does not need to be modulated therapeutically, as the drugs have no impact on disease outcome (Irwin et al., 1993; Chung et al., 2003) . The drugs are recommended if the cough attacks are too frequent and so significant that they extensively lessen the patient's comfort, or if the cough is persistent and painful.

These agents are effective when cough is a symptom during histamine-mediated conditions such as allergic rhinitis. In this case we can also use nasal cromolyn and corticosteroids. Irwin and Madison (2000) recommend the usage of antibiotic therapy for patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (if acute cough is accompanied by worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, or both), acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia and Bordetella pertussis infection. We deem it very important to say that antibiotic treatment should not be determined generally, such as for 3 weeks, but should be individualized. The duration of the treatment depends on symptoms, remission and normalization of patient's health constitution (well-being).",

If the patient feels that he is being observed, the cough accentuates. Agents from the group of anxiolytics such as guaifenesin (Guajacuran, Figure 6 ), or combinations of anxiolytics, with antitussives like guaifenesin+butamirate citrate in Stoptussin are used in the treatment of psychogenic cough (Nosalova et al., 1986a; Korpas and Nosalova, 1991; Parvez et al., 1996) . We found very strong cough-suppressive effect in benzodiazepine and phenotiazine derivatives ( Figure 6 ). These agents could also be used in the treatment of cough induced by psychogenic factors. In addition, antitussive action could be beneficially used for its tranquilizing effect. At the same time we have to be very careful while administering these drugs in patients who need to enforce expectoration. Special attention must be granted to diazepam ordination in pediatric practice, because in acute respiratory diseases associated with fever it very often used to be a part of polyvalent therapy. Its application could lead to suppression of breathing, consecutive phlegm stasis and global worsening of health of the patient. Psychotherapy, is very useful too.

The inhalation of anesthetizing aerosols leads to desensitization of cough receptors as well as other segments of mucous membranes in the mouth, and the upper and lower parts of the respiratory system, and increases the risk of aspiration . Inhalant procaine, lidocaine and bupivacaine inhibit the cough reflex elicited by both mechanical and chemical irritation. In clinical settings, the local anesthetics are used for the elimination of cough before diagnostic procedures such as laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, intubations, etc. In the mechanism of action of some cough-suppressing agents (benzonatate -Tessalon, dropropizine -Ditustat) a local anesthetic activity takes place apart from other properties Korpas and Nosalova, 1991) .",
