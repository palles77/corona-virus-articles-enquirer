            "text": "Traveling to extreme environments for the purpose of providing humanitarian aid is becoming more common with greater interconnectedness. The number of humanitarian agencies, including both United Nations (UN) bodies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), involved in complex emergencies and other humanitarian aid missions has increased significantly in the last two decades and has been accompanied by an increase in the number of recruited personnel designated to work in complex environments. 1, 2 The humanitarian aid worker (HAW) community is an extremely diverse group of organizations and individuals. Most HAWs originate from North America or West and Central Europe and their popular destinations include Africa (especially the sub-Saharan region) and Southeast Asia, but the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe are also temporary homes for many. They may travel for a period ranging from a few days to a few years and practice many different kinds of aid (medical, educational, agricultural, etc.). Most of them are in their 20s or 30s, but some are even elderly. They may be professional or nonprofessional; they may travel in big groups, in families with children, or as individuals. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Data about the extent of this phenomenon is still scarce. However, two surveys done in the United States in an interval of two decades demonstrated an increase in the percentage of travelers reporting volunteer work as their main travel purpose. Out of 2445 surveyed Americans who traveled to developing countries between 1984 and 1989, 5% did so for the purpose of voluntary/missionary activities. 7 In 2009, the number more than tripled with 17% reported traveling as volunteers or medical aid providers. 8 The GeoSentinel Network, the largest global database of travel-related morbidity, documented 40% of long-term travelers (>6 months abroad) traveled for volunteer or missionary purposes. As well, 7% of the shortterm travelers (<1 month) traveled for similar reasons. 9 If this reflects the nature of traveling, aid workers may become, if they are not already, a group of travelers that pose a specific challenge for travel medicine practitioners as well as for mental health specialists. This group is different from typical travelers because they tend to travel for longer periods, 9, 10 work in close proximity to local populations, and practice high-risk professions (medical work, peacekeeping missions, security, drivers, etc.) in low-resource environments that have poor infrastructures. In addition they tend to practice high-risk behaviors. 2, 11 Despite this fact, there are limited data focusing on this group; Peace Corps volunteers (PCVs), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and various UN agency employees represent one source of information, but these groups tend to be better organized, with structured recruiting, screening, and surveillance programs. This contrasts significantly with the many other volunteers sent on behalf of small, sometimes very inexperienced NGOs. Additional data may be extrapolated from few publications that focus on expatriates, long-term travelers, or others focusing on aid workers from different organizations. Therefore generalizations are difficult to make and personally tailored recommendations should be favored.",

Humanitarian aid workers (HAWs) typically travel for extended periods, work in close proximity to local populations, and work in high-risk environments in low-resource regions. Owing to the nature of their work, HAWs are often unable to avoid high-risk behaviors and frequently encounter stressful conditions, leading to psychologic repercussions. Although morbidity might be high, death during volunteer missions is not common and it is usually not attributable to infectious diseases. Medical evacuations are also not common. One unique aspect of ill-returning HAWs might be their threat to public health in their home countries, as was demonstrated in the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Thus pretravel and posttravel physical and psychologic screening evaluations, in addition to routine health care, are essential for this population.",

Illness among rescue teams or volunteers to natural disaster areas is reported only anecdotally. The only study known that has focused solely on the morbidity of the staff deployed in a field hospital was done during the deployment of the Israeli Defense Force field hospital to Nepal following the 2015 earthquake. Gastrointestinal (GI) complaints were by far the most common, with 53% of the entire staff affected. The group concluded that despite practicing in a standalone and well-equipped facility, prevention of GI problems was very difficult. 13 Thus, critical to all aid missions is careful briefing with regard to the challenges of food and water hygiene. A structured guideline may simplify the short preparation phase, as summarized in the experience of the Israeli Defense Force field hospital to the Philippines following the 2013 tsunami. 12",

Although NGO travelers had better knowledge about the transmission route of malaria, no difference was observed in their knowledge regarding means of prevention or symptoms requiring prompt medical consultation. 10 Furthermore, even medical doctors and nurses working for prolonged periods in malaria-risk areas are reluctant to take long-term malaria prophylaxis. In a study in a health care setting in Equatorial Guinea, including 108 Western medical staff and their families, almost half (n = 49) chose not to take any malaria chemoprophylaxis. 18 This report of poor adherence to malaria prophylaxis should prompt demonstrates that death during volunteer missions is not common and neither is medical evacuation.

Almost all the fatal injuries were of volunteers age 18-34. Death from chronic illnesses were more common in the older age group. 5 Comparing the first two decades and the following two decades of PCVs showed a decline in the overall death rate by more than half. This decrease was mainly attributed to the decline in motor vehicle accidents and the decreasing number of deaths from chronic illness. These changes resulted from restriction of motorcycle use by volunteers and better pretravel screening of applicants with chronic illnesses. 5, 6 According to the 2014 aid worker security report, 14 during 2013 a new record for violence against civilian aid operations was set, with 251 attacks affecting 460 aid workers; among them 155 aid workers were killed, 171 were seriously wounded, and 134 were kidnapped.

Among them, one-third (36.4%) reported a decline in health, and 72.8% reported having at least one medical problem during their mission. The rate of medical problems identified among them varied between regions, while traveling to Africa seemed to pose a greater risk in almost all reported categories of medical issues. 2 A wide range of illnesses are suffered during missions (Table 35 .1). These include conditions with similar incidence to those reported by GeoSentinel among ill-returned travelers: gastrointestinal (44%), febrile (23.3%), and dermatologic (19.5%). 16 However there are specific conditions that seem to be overexpressed among volunteers such as psychologic problems, gynecologic complaints, and dental emergencies (see Table 35 .1). It is very important to note, however, that GeoSentinel clinics (which, as mentioned, deal only with ill-returned travelers) are typically those whose specialty is travel and tropical medicine, and these providers do not typically see general medicine, surgery, trauma, or dental problems.",

These hospitals are mobile, self-contained, self-sufficient health care facilities capable of rapid deployment of immediate emergency requirements for a specified period of time. 17 Occupational exposure is another possible source of infection. It has long been established that health care workers are at increased risk of acquiring bloodborne infections through percutaneous or mucosal exposure. Health care workers traveling to HIV-prevalent countries are estimated to be at an even higher risk. A British study found that the risk of health care workers in developing areas of acquiring HIV infection through work was 1.5% over 5 years, which represents 1 in every 333 workers per year. 22 Another study showed that almost one-third of British medical students doing an elective period in a hospital in a developing country had experienced at least one exposure to potentially infectious body fluids during their clinical training. Of these exposures, 75% were unreported 23 ; 23% of American medical volunteers reported exposure to blood splash, and 2.3% experienced a needlestick. 24 Although the number of exposures do not necessarily differ from those in their home country hospitals, the risk may be much higher due to reusable and perhaps not disinfected medical devices; absence of a stable supply of protective measures such as gloves, gowns, and masks; a higher prevalence of patients with high HIV viral loads; and lack of knowledge or access to appropriate postexposure prophylaxis.",

Of Norwegian missionaries and aid workers serving in different regions, 7% were exposed to proven or suspected rabies during their mission. 26 PCVs are 10 times more likely to be exposed to rabies risk abroad than in the United States, 27 and numbers are as high as 3120 bites per 100,000 volunteers per year.

In addition to the delay in recognizing the existence of the outbreak, the Western world and international aid organizations were not fully prepared to contain the spread of the disease, neither within the disease-stricken areas nor across borders. The most common \"vectors\" for the 20 Ebola cases that were imported to Western countries were evacuated HAWs or those traveling commercially during the disease incubation period. The rapid development of interagency preparedness managed to contain the threat with only a few secondary Ebola cases (three nurses who treated Ebola patients). The lessons learned during and after this outbreak should serve as a model for preparedness and guidance against other potential threats. One might imagine as well the potential for transmission across borders of novel and severe respiratory illnesses such as influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the like.

Contact with an unfamiliar culture can lead to anxiety, stress, mental illness, and in extreme cases physical illness and suicide. 30, 31 Exposure to extreme events with multiple casualties poses an even greater risk of long-term mental health consequences. [32] [33] [34] Relief workers are usually younger and motivated individuals, who travel to places that are both geographically and culturally remote from their usual environs. They often travel without their family or familiar companion. They may travel to war zones and postdisaster areas where they may be exposed to large-scale death and suffering. As well, they often have great aspirations, sometimes unrealistic, about their future volunteer work and its effect on the community. These may all serve as precipitating factors for the development of emotional distress expressed by a wide range of symptoms, and may even develop into more serious mental health conditions. Two percent of PCVs in Madagascar seek mental health counseling outside of the routine support provided by the organization. The rate of reported mental health problems was more than double that among other volunteers in the entire African region. 3 Over 40% of ICRC volunteers reported upon return that their missions were more stressful than they had expected; 30% reported exhaustion for at least 1 week during their mission, while similar numbers reported sleeping problems; 10% used sleeping pills. Others reported behavior changes as contributors to stress: 14% reported an increase in alcohol consumption; 43% admitted to smoking more than usual, and an additional 10% started to smoke for the first time. These behavior changes were more common among those reporting exhaustion. Three percent reported having used illegal drugs, mainly cannabis, during their stays. 2 Suicide as a leading cause of death among international volunteers was first noticed in the Peace Corps: 13% of all reported deaths from 1981 to 1983 were due to suicide. These numbers declined drastically after applying a better screening procedure, with only one reported suicide in the following 20 years. 6,7 Unfortunately many organizations do not have a parallel screening process and follow-up capabilities.",
