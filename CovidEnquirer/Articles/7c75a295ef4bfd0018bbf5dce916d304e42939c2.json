Foals with GI disease are often treated with initial bolus fluid administration (20 mL/kg) of an acetated, isotonic IV crystalloid because this can be a very practical and effective means to stabilize these hypovolemic patients. The author finds continuous administration of IV fluids to foals in the field to be quite challenging particularly with inexperienced clients. Smaller volume (eg, 10 mL/kg) fluid boluses can be repeated every 3 to 6 hours, depending on the amount of fluids being lost (ie, diarrhea or reflux) and the volume of milk that the foal is ingesting. Fluid balance is critically important in foals, and clients and practitioners should carefully monitor for signs of fluid overload with repeated fluid bolus administration.",

In the author's opinion, the immediate cessation of pain is one of the single most important contributions that a veterinarian can make on arrival to evaluate and treat a horse with GI disease. With analgesia, the horse is more easily handled and the owners quickly feel that the situation is under control. Numerous treatments for pain management are available to the equine practitioner in the field setting, and some of the more common options are discussed later. Similar to fluid therapy, pain management options can be separated into both intermittent and continuous dosing.
