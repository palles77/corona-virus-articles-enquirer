            "text": "The field of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has expanded dramatically as new procedures, instruments, and accessories have been introduced into the medical community; more than 20 million GI endoscopies are performed annually in the United States. 1, 2 Although GI endoscopes are used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for a broad spectrum of GI disorders, more health care-associated infectious outbreaks and patient exposures have been linked to contaminated endoscopes than to any other reusable medical device. [3] [4] [5] [6] Failure to adhere to established reprocessing guidelines or the use of defective reprocessing equipment accounts for the majority of these cases. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] In addition, complex endoscopes such as the duodenoscope and linear echoendoscope with elevator mechanisms can transmit bacterial infections even when reprocessing protocols are reportedly followed in accordance with manufacturer and societal guidelines. [14] [15] [16] The topic of endoscope reprocessing has largely been taken for granted by many endoscopists; however, standardized cleaning and disinfection protocols have been available for some time, and, with few exceptions, changes have been gradual. This slow evolution with a high safety profile may have engendered some complacency on the part of endoscopists, to the point that many endoscopists are only vaguely aware of what goes on \"behind the curtain\" of the endoscope reprocessing room. Instruments are used on patients, taken away by GI nurses or other health care personnel, reprocessed, and returned ready for patient use.",

This standard is endorsed by governmental agencies including the Joint Commission (JC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 37 and the FDA. 38 It is also endorsed by gastroenterology societies such as the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), as well as medical organizations, including the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses (AORN), Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates (SGNA), Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). [39] [40] [41] [42] HLD of endoscopes eliminates all viable microorganisms, but not necessarily all are alike, however. Steam is the most extensively utilized process and is routinely monitored by the use of biologic indicators (e.g., spore test strips) to show that sterilization has been achieved. When liquid chemical germicides (LCGs) are used to eradicate all microorganisms, they can be called chemical sterilants; however, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other authorities have stated that these processes do not convey the same level of assurance as other sterilization methods. [28] [29] [30] Other commonly used sterilization processes include low-temperature gas such as ethylene oxide (ETO), liquid chemicals, and hydrogen peroxide gas plasma. 31",

The efficacy of HLD is dependent on several factors and includes the type and level of microbial contamination; effective precleaning of the endoscope; presence of biofilm; physical properties of the object; concentration, temperature, pH, and exposure time to the germicide; and drying after rinsing to avoid diluting the disinfectant. 32 2. Intermediate-level disinfection: the destruction of all mycobacteria, vegetative bacteria, fungal spores, and some nonlipid viruses, but not bacterial spores. 3. Low-level disinfection: a process that can kill most bacteria (except mycobacteria or bacterial spores), most viruses (except some nonlipid viruses), and some fungi. Although this categorization for disinfection levels generally remains valid, there are examples of disinfection issues with prions, viruses, mycobacteria, and protozoa that challenge these definitions. 34 Antiseptics are chemicals intended to reduce or destroy microorganisms on living tissue (e.g., skin), as opposed to disinfectants, which are used on inanimate objects (e.g., medical devices such as endoscopes). The difference in the way the same chemical is used to achieve different levels of disinfection and sterilization is important for endoscopy because the contact times for sterilization with any given LCG are generally much longer (hours) than for high-level disinfection (minutes) and may be detrimental to the endoscope. The relative resistance of various microorganisms to LCGs is shown in Box 4.1.",

[49] [50] [51] [52] Because accessory items often do not have unique identification numbers, it is critical to ensure they are dedicated to and stored with the endoscope that they are used with. This is necessary to ensure that if there is an outbreak, it is possible to identify which accessory components were used. This may require the use of disposable accessory holders or holders such as mesh bags that are also reprocessed along with the accessories. Most accessory instruments used during endoscopy either contact the bloodstream (e.g., biopsy forceps, snares, and sphincterotomes) or enter sterile tissue spaces (e.g., biliary tract) and are classified as critical devices. As such, these devices require sterilization. 49, 50 These accessories may be available as disposable \"single-use\" or \"reusable\" instruments. Reuse of devices labeled single-use only remains controversial but has been commonly employed in many practices, primarily for economic benefits. 44, [53] [54] [55] [56] The FDA 57 considers reprocessing a used single-use device into a ready-for-patient-use device as \"manufacturing,\" and as a result, hospitals or third-party reprocessing 58, 59 companies that reprocess these devices are required to follow the same regulations as the original equipment manufacturers (i.e., obtain 510[k] and premarket approval application; submit adverse event reports; demonstrate sterility and integrity of the reprocessed devices; and implement detailed quality assurance monitoring protocols). This includes the development of standards and policies to determine the maximum number of uses for the devices and the training of staff in the reprocessing procedures. [59] [60] [61] [62] The regulatory burden imposed by these requirements essentially eliminated the practice of the reprocessing of single-use devices by most hospitals.",

            "text": "LCGs have inherent limitations; however, they are universally used to reprocess flexible endoscopes and accessories due to their relative convenience, safety, and rapid action. LCGs used as HLDs should ideally have the following properties: broad antimicrobial spectrum, rapid onset of action, activity in the presence of organic material, lack of toxicity for patients and endoscopy personnel, long reuse life, low cost, odorless, ability to monitor concentration, and nondamaging to the endoscope or the environment. 18, 32 HLD solutions can act as sterilants if an increased exposure time is used 28, 48, 78 ; however, the exposure time required to achieve sterilization with most LCG solutions is far longer than is practical, and therefore these formulations are only used for HLD. 48, 79 The efficacy of chemical disinfectants and sterilants is dependent on their physical properties including concentration and temperature; the length of exposure of the endoscope to the chemical solutions; the type and amount of microbial debris on the endoscope; and the mechanical components of the endoscope such as channels and crevices. Because the chemicals are toxic to humans and the environment, proper handling, thorough rinsing, and appropriate disposal are essential for human safety. 71 When selecting a HLD product, institutional requirements need to be taken into consideration with important variables including the number of endoscopes processed per day, training requirements, turnaround time, cost information, and regulatory issues regarding safe use of the HLD products. Health care workers who use HLDs need to be familiar with and have readily accessible, product/brand-specific Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and keep current with regulatory changes and new product developments. 18 Users should consult with manufacturers of endoscopes and AERs for compatibility before selecting an LCG. The most commonly used FDA approved LCGs for disinfection of flexible endoscopes include glutaraldehyde, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), peracetic acid, and hydrogen peroxide (Table 4 .1) 71,80,81 based chemicals in varying combinations and concentrations. Some formulations contain combinations of microbicidal agents, including glutaraldehyde and phenol/phenate, peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and glutaraldehyde and isopropyl alcohol. The FDA periodically updates a list of approved HLD solutions along with some of their attributes, such as contact time and temperature required for HLD. 82 Sterilization of endoscopes is indicated on occasions when they are used as critical medical devices during open surgical procedures. The risk for contamination of the operative field exists when a nonsterile endoscope enters the abdomen through sterilants. [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] AERs continuously bathe the exterior surface of the endoscope and circulate the LCG under pressure through the endoscope channels. The AER manufacturer identifies each endoscope (brand and model) that is compatible with the AER and specifies limitations of reprocessing models of endoscopes and accessories. Variations in AERs may require customization of the facility design to accommodate requirements for ventilation; water pressure, temperature, and filtration; plumbing; power delivery; and space. All models of AERs have disinfection and rinse cycles. In addition, the AERs may also have one or more of the following automated capabilities: 32,68,71 1. Some AERs utilize and discard small quantities of LCG per HLD cycle, whereas others have a reservoir of LCG that is reused over multiple cycles. The latter design results in gradual dilution of the LCG and requires intermittent testing to verify maintenance of the minimum effective concentration (MEC). Product-specific test strips need to be used regularly to monitor these solutions, 48 which should be discarded whenever they fall below the MEC or when the use-life expires, whichever comes first. 2. The temperature and cycle length can be altered to ensure HLD or sterilization based on the LCG and type of endoscope. 3. The AER should ensure circulation of LCGs through all endoscope channels at an equal pressure with flow sensors for automated detection of channel obstruction. 4. The AER should be self-disinfecting. 5. Vapor recovery systems are available. 6. Low intensity ultrasound waves are an option. 7. Variable number of endoscopes per cycle. 8. Some AERs flush the endoscope channels with forced air or with 70% to 80% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol followed by forced air to aid in drying the endoscope channels, thereby eliminating residual water, which reduces microbial growth during storage. 9. The AER should incorporate a self-contained or external water filtration system. LCGs and AERs must meet specified performance levels for HLD to receive FDA clearance. This is defined as a reduction in residual organic loads and a 6-log 10 killing of resistant indicator organisms (typically Mycobacterium bovis). All AERs marketed in the United States meet these criteria. The ASGE has published a summary of vendor-specific AERs and their compatible LCGs. 65 The FDA has approved labeling some AERs as washer-disinfectors due to the introduction of automated, brushless washing of endoscope channels prior to the disinfection cycle. Utilization of this AER washing cycle provides an extra margin of safety by providing redundancy of cleaning; however, the existing multisociety guideline 45 and other international standards emphasize that manual cleaning is still necessary when a washer-disinfector is used to assure the overall efficacy of HLD. 65, 72 One AER (Steris System 1E [SS1E]; Steris Corp, Mentor, OH) has received FDA approval for liquid chemical sterilization, as opposed to HLD, for heat-sensitive devices that cannot be sterilized by traditional means. 73 This system uses filtered, ultraviolettreated water that enters the AER and mixes with a peracetic acid-based formulation that is subsequently heated to 46\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C for liquid chemical sterilization. 74 This system is designed for \"point of use\" sterilization, as sterile storage is not possible. For flexible endoscopes processed through the SS1E, there is still a requirement for an alcohol rinse and drying prior to placing the endoscope into a storage cabinet.",

            "text": "The FDA also requested that AER manufacturers conduct additional validation testing to evaluate AER reprocessing Agent/Action ever more complex GI flexible endoscopes. The combination of ultrasonic capability with flexible endoscopes has opened up a new tool to use for the diagnosis and staging of cancers. However, along with these improvements that enhance diagnostic capabilities comes the increasing complexity of the endoscope channels. These complexities include double instrument channels with connector bridges, ultrasound probe channels, auxiliary channels, and elevator lever wire channels (sealed and unsealed). These complexities in endoscopes have far-reaching impacts in terms of reprocessing of reusable flexible endoscopes. This has been painfully highlighted by the recent outbreaks of antibiotic resistant bacteria associated with fully reprocessed endoscopes that remain contaminated 15,28,93-104 and act as fomites that transmit bacteria to a high percentage of subsequent patients who are exposed to the contaminated endoscope (see later section on Infection Control Issues for more detailed information on infection transmission). Such outbreaks have focused attention on the cleaning and disinfection of flexible endoscopes. There has been a paradigm change in that it is now recognized that reprocessing of GI flexible endoscopes is an extremely complex process that requires a quality systems approach, which includes specific training for reprocessing personnel, adequate monitoring of various stages in the reprocessing cycle, and ongoing documentation of staff competency. 48, 95, [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] Human factors play a critical role in compliance with reprocessing of GI endoscopes. 115 Ofstead et al (2010) demonstrated that compliance with all the reprocessing steps occurred for only an incision, as occurs with selected methods of intraoperative enteroscopy or postsurgical anatomy endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). 84, 85 Endoscopes, when sterilized, require low-temperature methods because they are heat labile and therefore, unlike most other medical or surgical devices, they cannot undergo steam sterilization. ETO is the most commonly employed low-temperature sterilization process and a valuable method of sterilizing flexible endoscopes. However, a lengthy aeration time is required following ETO sterilization to allow desorption of all residual toxic gas from the endoscope. Additional steps must be taken, such as the application of a venting valve or the removal of the water-resistant cap to ensure proper perfusion with the gas and to prevent damage to the endoscope due to excessive pressure build-up. In addition, there are potential hazards to staff, patients, and the environment related to ETO toxicities (Table 4 .2). 86 The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified ETO as a known (group 1) human carcinogen. Within the past two decades, several new, low-temperature (< 60\u00b0C) sterilization systems have been developed, including hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid immersion, and ozone 87-92 (see Table 4 .2). endoscopes and are not trained on specific cleaning requirements. The use of different sizes and types of channel brushes for the various different channel sizes, the fact that some channels cannot be brushed, and the multitude of different types of cleaning brushes available makes duodenoscope reprocessing a confusing process prone to human error.",

As such, every site offering flexible endoscopy procedures should ensure they have an established quality system for reprocessing these complex devices as recommended by the FDA 110 and CDC. 123 Table 4 .3 provides an overview of what components are needed for such a system. As recommended by the CDC, 123 the first step that all health care facilities should undertake is to perform an audit by reviewing their current endoscopy services to ensure they meet all aspects of a quality system approach. This requires input from administration, risk management, endoscopy staff, and infection prevention and control to ensure that all components are adequately assessed and the appropriate policies and procedures documented and implemented. Table 4 .4 provides an overview of the key steps in reprocessing and outlines where mistakes are frequently made, as well as the impact of such mistakes. It is important that audits done for endoscope reprocessing are observational and based on a specific checklist of critical components, as well as data to substantiate processes (e.g., time data to show contact time with detergent during cleaning, as well as transport times to determine how frequently it exceeds 1 hour). Table 4 .4 is a useful aid to review during initial training of staff, as well as during discussion of audit data on a yearly basis.",

Appropriate benchmarks for cleaning markers have been established. 48, 54, 109, 118, 121, [124] [125] [126] There are a number of rapid cleaning tests (RCT) available for monitoring organic residuals such as hemoglobin, carbohydrate, and protein, as well as those that monitor ATP residuals. There are published data for some of these rapid test methods, 112,125-132 but when selecting a rapid cleaning monitor, it is important to request that the rapid test manufacturer provide their validation data. Review of the pros and cons of the testing method based on the validation data provided by the manufacturer is an important step when selecting the RCT. Examples of the considerations for selecting the RCT are shown in Table 4 .5. Once the RCT has been selected, a way to document the RCT results is needed (e.g., a record sheet that identifies the scope tested, the person doing the testing, date and time of testing, result of testing, and the result of retesting for those scopes that fail the RCT and require recleaning).",

This should be performed on the next patient use of each endoscope after completion of manual cleaning and rinsing. If the initial RCT fails for the majority of the endoscopes, this device-reprocessing guidelines, and endoscope manufacturers' instructions for use. The key \"domino\" in this chain of changes was the 2015 FDA Guide to Manufacturers of Reusable Medical Devices (FDA, March 2015) that required manufacturers to validate that their cleaning instructions were effective and could achieve predetermined benchmarks. Cleaning validation for medical device reprocessing was not previously required; the focus was on validation of the disinfection or sterilization protocols recommended by manufacturers for their medical devices. When transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) associated with contaminated duodenoscopes was recognized and first investigated and reported in the United States, 14 it was unclear why reprocessing of duodenoscopes was failing. However, it was clear that transmission rates from contaminated duodenoscopes were high (up to 45%) and that, in addition to causing infections, patients often became colonized with CRE and remained colonized long after the exposure to the CRE contaminated duodenoscope. Some health care facilities continued to report CRE transmission and suggested that the manufacturers' instructions for use (MIFUs) for endoscope reprocessing were inadequate 15, 103, 116 and that was why endoscope contamination was ongoing. Although there had been recent design changes by the three main duodenoscope manufacturers whereby the elevator wire channel was sealed, the transmission of CRE was reported for duodenoscopes with both sealed and unsealed elevator wire channels. 14,15,103 However, one thing was clear; it was very difficult to adequately clean the lever cavity in duodenoscopes, and visible patient debris under the elevator lever was detected in one published outbreak. 95 This has prompted new validated cleaning instructions for the lever cavity of duodenoscopes. 117 The CRE outbreaks linked to contaminated duodenoscopes prompted the FDA to convene an advisory panel meeting in May 2015, and on August 4, 2015, the FDA issued a Safety Communication 110 with the recommendations from the advisory panel meeting that included: 1. Establishing and implementing a comprehensive quality control program for endoscopy reprocessing to ensure meticulous adherence to MIFUs for duodenoscope reprocessing, adequate training of reprocessing personnel, and audits to ensure ongoing compliance. 2. Supplemental measures to be considered by sites offering ERCP procedures, including:",

Sites need to have a response plan in place regarding notification if culture shows organisms of concern on an endoscope that has been used on multiple patients (i.e., notify the patient, the doctor or both?) not be detected after HLD as these organisms commonly result in a clinically significant infection including gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Enterobacteriaceae) as well as Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp. 159 LCO are less often associated with disease; these bacteria typically include coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, diptheroids, and Bacillus spp. The levels of LCO on a surveillance endoscope culture can vary depending on the reprocessing, handling, and culturing practices in a facility. Typically, fewer than 10 colony forming units (CFU) of LCO does not require intervention as this most likely represents collection process contamination rather than a significant problem with the disinfection or cleaning process. 159 Interpretation of culture results with 10 or greater CFU of LCO should be considered in the context of typical culture results at the facility. 111 Any endoscope found to be contaminated with a HCO or unacceptable CFU of LCO should cause concern and lead to repeat endoscope reprocessing followed by post-reprocessing cultures. The endoscope should be quarantined until it has been demonstrated to be free of HCO and has an acceptable level of LCO. Positive cultures should also prompt a review of the endoscopy unit reprocessing procedures to ensure adherence to the manufacturer's reprocessing instructions and to ensure proper culture methodology. If a reprocessing breach is identified, appropriate facility personnel should be notified and corrective actions should be immediately implemented. When bacteria are persistently recovered by surveillance cultures, refer to the manufacturer's instructions 111, 159 for evaluating the endoscope for mechanical defects and consider having the endoscope evaluated by the manufacturer. In addition, when ineffective reprocessing is suspected based on surveillance cultures, it might be helpful to review positive cultures among affected patients to determine whether transmission of relevant pathogens could have occurred. 111, 159 ",

In the hierarchy of relative resistance to HLD, vegetative bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. and Salmonella spp. are the most susceptible to disinfectants, whereas the mycobacteria are less susceptible and bacterial spores (e.g., Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium difficile) are the most difficult to eliminate (see Box 4.1). Nevertheless, as previously stated, all bacteria with the exception of a few bacterial spores are highly sensitive and eliminated by HLD. Salmonella is a serious primary pathogen, and Pseudomonas is ubiquitous in many water sources, and although both these pathogens have been associated most frequently with endoscopic transmission, they are both sensitive to multiple agents, including glutaraldehyde, and other HLDs. Transmission of bacterial pathogens from flexible endoscopes has been rare since the adoption of the current 2011 multisociety reprocessing guideline, 45, 160 with the exception of duodenoscope-related infections (discussed later).",

Endoscopes can harbor between 10 9 and 10 12 enteric organisms at the completion of some patient procedures. This bioburden is reduced by cleaning (i.e., bedside precleaning followed by manual cleaning) by a factor of 2 to 6 log 10 and the HLD step is expected to provide a 6 log 10 reduction of any microbes remaining after cleaning. 124, 153 Therefore the margin of safety associated with cleaning and HLD of GI endoscopes is low, and any deviation from proper reprocessing could lead to failure to eliminate contamination, with a possibility of subsequent patient-to-patient transmission.",

All these established pathogens are susceptible to currently available chemical disinfectants and sterilants. 17, 32 Low Concern Organisms (LCO) versus High Concern Organisms (HCO) Surveillance cultures of endoscopes are assessed for two general categories of microbial growth, LCO and HCO. HCO should be changed to protect our patients from CJD, citing no reported cases of CJD transmission by endoscopy and the lack of exposure to high-risk CNS tissue during endoscopic procedures. 17, 183 vCJD is a rare but fatal condition caused by the consumption of beef contaminated with a bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent. It differs from CJD in that the mutated prion protein can be found in lymphoid tissue throughout the body, including the gut and tonsils. 182, 184 Only three cases of vCJD have been reported in the United States, and all three patients contracted the disease elsewhere. 184 As vCJD is resistant to conventional disinfectants and sterilants, endoscopy should be avoided, if at all possible, in patients known to harbor this agent. 17, 184 Endoscopes used in individuals with definite, probable, or possible vCJD should be destroyed after use or quarantined to be reused exclusively on that same individual if required. 182, 184 ",

[191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200] [201] [202] In response to the problems with duodenoscope reprocessing, the FDA requested all three duodenoscope manufacturers to revise and validate their reprocessing instructions with provisions for additional duodenoscope reprocessing measures. 191 This led to the modification of manufacturers' reprocessing protocols with a larger emphasis on precleaning and manual cleaning before HLD. 117, [192] [193] [194] One duodenoscope manufacturer (Olympus; Center Valley, PA) subsequently modified the design of the closed elevator channel to create a tighter seal. 195, 196 In addition, the FDA has recommended that health care facilities performing ERCP consider employing supplemental measures for duodenoscope reprocessing when facilities have the resources to do so. 110 Most sites where outbreaks have occurred have chosen per procedure ETO sterilization after HLD as its primary reprocessing method, and in all reported instances, ETO has prevented further MDRO transmission. 110, 185 However, one site reported failure to eliminate MDRO contamination of a duodenoscope after HLD and ETO. 116 Alternative reprocessing endoscopic transmission of other enteric bacteria include Klebsiella spp., 164 Enterobacter spp., 165 Serratia spp., 166 and Staphylococcus aureus. 164 The few reports of endoscopic transmission of Helicobacter pylori were related to inadequate reprocessing of endoscopes and biopsy forceps. [167] [168] [169] Current reprocessing guidelines are shown to inactivate Clostridium difficile spores, 170 and no cases of endoscopic transmission of this infection or mycobacteria have been reported. In summary, there have not been any observed GI endoscopy-related transmission of bacterial pathogens since introduction of the currently accepted reprocessing standards with the exception of duodenoscope-related outbreaks (discussed later).",

Thus, even when a flexible endoscope is contaminated with viral pathogens, the burden of virus cannot increase, as they are not capable of ex vivo replication.

All prions remain infectious for years in a dried state, and resist all routine sterilization and disinfection procedures commonly used by health care facilities. 17, [178] [179] [180] [181] CJD is confined to the central nervous system (CNS) and is transmitted by exposure to infectious tissues from the brain, pituitary, or eye, whereas tissues and secretions that come into contact with the endoscope during procedures, such as saliva, gingival tissue, intestinal tissue, feces, and blood, are considered noninfectious by the World Health Organization. 17, [179] [180] [181] [182] The CDC and other infection control experts conclude that current guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting medical devices need not will help with the investigation and lead to an expeditious correction of any deficiencies that are identified. \u2022 A user facility is not required to report a device malfunction, but it can voluntarily advise the FDA of such product problems using the voluntary MedWatch Form FDA 3500 under FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program. 201 However, if a device failure leads to a death or serious injury, the FDA and the manufacturer must be contacted, as outlined in facility policies, by the designated individual or department at the facility. 202 The FDA encourages health care professionals, patients, caregivers, and consumers to submit voluntary reports of significant adverse events or product problems with medical products to MedWatch (https://www.accessdata.fda.-gov/scripts/ medwatch/), the FDA's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program \u2022 Manufacturers are required to report to the FDA when they learn that any of their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or when they become aware that their device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. 201,202 6. Patient notification and counseling: 200, 203 in instances where a breach in the reprocessing protocol or damaged equipment poses a risk to patients for adverse events, it becomes the institution's ethical obligation to notify patients in a timely manner. Notification may be accomplished by a direct meeting, telephone call, and letter sent by registered mail. The content should include an assessment of the risk, possible adverse events that may occur, symptoms and signs of the adverse event, time range for the adverse event, risk to other contacts, possible prophylactic therapy (including benefits and risks), and recommended medical follow-up. Prompt notification allows patients to take precautions to minimize the risk of transmitting infection to others and allows for early serologic testing. This may help distinguish chronic infections from those potentially acquired at the time of endoscopy and to permit earlier initiation of treatment for newly acquired infections. On the other hand, adverse publicity associated with the reporting of a reprocessing error might lead patients to avoid potentially life-saving endoscopic procedures because of an unwarranted fear of infection. Personal counseling should be offered to all patients. The risk of infection should be discussed and placed in context to minimize patient anxiety. Patients should be advised against donating blood and tissue products and engaging in sexual contact without barrier protection until all serologic testing is complete. A toll-free helpline should be established to provide information to all patients at risk. 7.

Care is needed to ensure all brushing steps are done underneath the water surface to reduce aerosols. Holding the control head above water to insert the channel brush and then pulling the brush out of the channel while the control head is above the water generates significant aerosols of the contaminated detergent solution. In addition, during the air-flushing process after cleaning is completed, a piece of gauze should be placed over the distal end of the endoscope channel prior to placing it in an AER to prevent creation of aerosols when flushing out residual rinse water. A final, often overlooked step, is rinsing and decontamination of the sink after EACH endoscope is cleaned. This ensures that the sink does not accumulate microbial contamination over time and act as a reservoir within the reprocessing area to contaminate reprocessing personnel or other endoscopes. If flushing pumps are used as part of the manual cleaning step, they also require routine (usually daily) decontamination as per MIFU to ensure they do not become a reservoir of microbes that develop biofilm and subsequently contaminate endoscopes that they are used on.",
