            "text": "Seizures have been reported frequently in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) but have not been studied in detail in association with this disease. The purpose of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of neurological signs in a population of 55 cats with a histopathologically confirmed neurological form of FIP. Seizure patterns were determined and it was attempted to relate occurrence of seizures with age, breed, sex and neuropathological features. Fourteen cats had seizure(s), while 41 cats had no history of seizure(s). Generalised toniceclonic seizures were seen in nine cats; and complex focal seizures were observed in four patients. The exact type of seizure could not be determined in one cat. Status epilepticus was observed in one patient but seizure clusters were not encountered. Occurrence of seizures was not related to age, sex, breed or intensity of the inflammation in the central nervous system. However, seizures were significantly more frequent in animals with marked extension of the inflammatory lesions to the forebrain (P \u00bc 0.038). Thus, the occurrence of seizures in FIP indicates extensive brain damage and can, therefore, be considered to be an unfavourable prognostic sign. F eline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a multisystemic disease caused by a macrophage tropic mutant of feline coronavirus (FCoV), is the leading infectious cause of cat death (Vennema et al 1998 , Hartmann 2005 . FIP associated meningoencephalitis is considered to be the most common inflammatory disorder in the feline neuraxis (Bradshaw et al 2004) . The development of FIP is thought to be due to the host immune response (Addie et al 2004) . Up to one-third of cats with 'dry' FIP, but also some cats with the effusive form, have neurological abnormalities . In the brains of cats with FIP histopathological findings were meningitis, ependymitis, periventriculitis and chorioiditis of varying severity (Baroni and Heinhold 1995) . Perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils and macrophages are usually associated with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways, but may extend into the neurophil (Rand et al 1994) . Arteritis, phlebitis, secondary oedema fluid exudation and haemorrhage have also been observed. Hydrocephalus has been seen in association with meningitis, choroiditis, accumulation of cellular debris in the ventricles and obstruction of the CSF flow (Summers et al 1995 , Mu\u00f1 ana 1996 .",

The histopathological diagnosis was based on the presence of typical lesions, which are highly characteristic for FIP (Summers et al 1995) . Unlike other viral infections of the CNS, FIP lesions are primarily related to deposition of FIPV immune complexes in choroid plexus and blood vessels, precipitating a violent pyogranulomatous inflammation in the CSF compartment. Both distribution and nature of the lesions cannot be confused with other viral infections in which parenchymal mononuclear inflammation, neuronal degenerations and gliosis are the main features. All included cats were examined at the Institute of Animal Neurology, University of Bern, Switzerland, during the years 1985e2005. Only records with detailed history, clinical and neurological examination and histopathological diagnosis were selected. Cats were divided into two groups. Group A was composed of cats with a history of seizure(s) and group B included only cats in which no seizure(s) had been reported.",

Unilateral or asymmetrical motor signs without impairment of consciousness characterised simple focal seizures. Complex focal seizures were diagnosed when unilateral or asymmetrical motor signs occurred together with impaired consciousness, or when a purely transient and involuntary change in behaviour (characterised by jumping, biting and attacking real or imaginary objects without provocation or running blindly into objects) was observed. Secondary generalisation of simple or complex focal seizures was noted. Status epilepticus was defined as continuous epileptic activity or the presence of two or more separate seizure episodes without a return to consciousness between them for more than 30 min. Clusters of seizures were diagnosed when two or more isolated seizures were observed during a 24-h period with the patient regaining consciousness between them.",

In addition, we attempted to relate occurrence of seizures with breed, age, sex and neuropathological findings. Cases were selected based on typical histological findings in the CNS. Immunohistochemical demonstration of FIP antigen could have been used to confirm the diagnosis. Apart from the fact that this technique has not been validated in any great number of feline inflammatory CNS lesions, the neuropathology of FIP is highly characteristic (Summers et al 1995) . Because of their immunopathological nature FIP lesions differ totally from other viral infections. Suppurative inflammation could also occur in bacterial and mycotic infections, which would rarely completely mimic the FIP lesions in respect to distribution and morphology and organisms could be readily detected. Therefore, we believe that the inclusion of cases in the present study strictly based on neuropathological criteria was a reasonable approach. Twenty-five percent of the cats in this study demonstrated seizures associated with neurological FIP which is similar to the findings in another retrospective study on cats with intracranial neoplasia, where incidence of seizures was reported to be 22.5% (Troxel et al 2003) . The range of age in our population was similar to previous reports, showing that FIP can occur at any age (Rand et al 1994 , Stacy 2000 and did not differ between the two groups. The claimed predisposition to FIP for some pure breeds of cat (Pesteanu-Somogyi et al 2006) was not apparent in our study. The breed distribution of the cats in our study roughly reflected the breed distribution of our overall feline hospital population. The distribution between the sexes was almost equal in our and previous studies and is consistent with the sex distribution in the overall feline population in our hospital. Therefore, it seems that age, sex and breed play little role in seizure genesis in the neurological form of FIP.",

In contrast, in some studies on secondary epilepsy in cats, generalised seizures dominated (Quesnel et al 1997 , Barnes et al 2004 . Generalised seizures were registered in most of our cases, but the majority of ictal events were observed and described by owners in our study. Therefore, a focal seizure initiating the ictal event could have gone unnoticed. It is usually assumed that clusters of seizures or status epilepticus reflect progression of the underlying disease. Compensatory mechanisms in the brain may become exhausted due to increasing lesion volume and development of significant structural damage. Despite severe and progressive neuropathological lesions, status epilepticus was rare in our case material (1/14) and clusters of seizures were not observed. While we did not find any literature on the incidence of cluster seizures or status epilepticus associated with particular types of structural brain damage in cats our findings suggest that species-specific differences may exist in this respect. For example, intracranial neoplasia induces status epilepticus in up to 15% of human or canine patients (Towne et al 1994 , DeLorenzo et al 1995 , Bateman and Parent 1999 , Knake et al 2001 , Platt and Haag 2002 , Gandini et al 2003 .",

            "text": "The mechanism of seizure induction in FIP has not been studied so far. Most of the examined cats in our study with neurological FIP, with or without seizures, also have lesions in other organ systems. It is impossible to specify the extent to which extra-neural lesions, notably liver disease, could have contributed to seizure genesis in our cats. Neither liver failure nor a clinical presentation suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy was seen in any of our epileptic cats. Rather, we believe that seizures in our animals were due to the observed severe intracranial lesions. In one large study on 220 dogs with inflammatory disease of the CNS, only 13% of the dogs had been suffering from seizures (Tipold 1995 ). It appears from our findings that, in cats too, the presence of an inflammatory process in the CNS per se is not sufficient to elicit seizures. All cats with or without seizures had severe inflammation in the meninges and ventricles, presumably with secretion of vast amount of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines diffusing throughout the CSF compartment. Rather, our findings suggest that secondary structural changes in the cerebrum were responsible for the seizures. The cerebral cortex is the primary element in the generation of an epileptic attack (Fischer et al 2005) . Also in patients with intracranial tumours, supra-tentorial lesions are associated with higher prevalence of seizures in dogs, cats and humans (Zaki and Hurvitz 1976 , Bagley et al 1999 , Troxel et al 2003 , Hildebrand et al 2005 . A clinical forebrain localisation was much more frequent among the cats who suffered from seizures (7/14) as compared with cats without seizures (1/41) in our material. Severe obstructive hydrocephalus and marked extension of the inflammatory process in the forebrain appeared to enhance seizure incidence in our material, and the presence of parenchymal involvement of the cerebrum was significantly related with occurrence of seizures.",
