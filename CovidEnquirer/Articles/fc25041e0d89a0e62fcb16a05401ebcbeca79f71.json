            "text": "Common cold, often known as cold, 1 is an acute upper respiratory tract viral infection caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) etc. It is the most common viral infection with a sporadic incidence and self-limiting nature. The often seen symptoms are nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and cough. The natural course of the cold varies from 4 to 10 days, if no complications involve. Various complications may be present in a common cold including supurative pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis, or acute progression or deterioration of underlying respiratory diseases. Probability of complications increases in the elderly, patients with chronic heart, lung, kidney or cerebral disorders or compromised immunity. Up to now, no evidence-based guidelines have been published on common cold for clinical practice. Generations of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners have developed quite a few formulas for the cold. They have been prepared in various forms such as tablet, pill, powder, capsule, and oral liquid etc specified by China Pharmacopeia. 2 The China Pharmacopeia 2010 documents 56 formulas for the cold. 3 Studies have demonstrated many ingredients or compounds of TCM remedy for common cold. They have the following effects: diaphoresis and antipyretic, 4,5 analgesic and tranquilizer, 6 cough suppressant, 5 anti-inflammation, 7, 8 anti-microorganism, 7 antivirus 5,7,9 and immunoregulation. 7 \"TCM pattern or syndrome is an outcome of analysis of TCM information by TCM practitioner. Pattern classification is a traditional diagnostic method to categorize the patients based on their different conditions\". 10 The treatment of common cold in TCM is based on pattern differentiation. According to TCM theory, common cold is considered as exterior syndrome, which can be further divided into the wind-cold, wind-heat and summer-heat dampness syndrome. Exterior syndrome in common cold is due to external contraction of pathogenic factors of wind-cold, wind-heat or summer-heat damp. Sometimes common cold occurred in the patients who suffer from other patterns. If a patient with Qi deficiency was exposed to wind-cold, this is the Qi deficiency syndrome complicated by exterior syndrome. As clinical guidelines in modern times are made based on evidence, TCM guidelines on common cold shall also be derived from evidence, which was obtained from a systematic literature review. A guideline steering committee and its review group established by China Academy of Chinese Medical Science participated in reviewing and finalizing the guidelines. The evidence-based guidelines on common cold for clinical practice was published in 2011. 11",

The authors have tried to integrate evidence-based medicine into the drafting of guidelines on common cold for TCM treatment. As there is still no enough literature to provide sound evidence that meets the standards of modern evidence-based medicine, it seems quite difficult to formulate the guidelines that are totally consistent with tenet of evidence-based medicine. Apart from the four syndromes mentioned above, following syndromes such as wind-damp exterior syndrome, wind-heat exterior syndrome accompanied with Yin deficiency, deserved further study. Currently, Guidelines for Clinical Studies on New TCM Drugs 62 uses a scale of four levels: totally recovered, significantly effective, effective and ineffective to measure outcome after three-day treatment. There are three outcome measurements: disease, syndrome and temperature, all of which are based on symptom scoring. We propose that symptom relief and its timing should be the major outcome measured to demonstrate instant symptom relief and duration reduction. Follow-up should be conducted to evaluate the incidence of cough after suffering from cold, suppurative pharyngitis, sinusitis and otitis media in order to investigate whether TCM could reduce the incidence of complications and provide a bigger picture for TCM's efficacy. As the treatment course is fairly short in common cold and there has been few reports on adverse events. Safety evaluation should be, nonetheless, incorporated into clinical trials on common cold. The medications recommended in this guideline have been in wide use for a long period of time yet without evidence of modern sense. With the improvement of TCM research and methodology, more good quality studies are to be conducted to update and refine the guidelines.",
