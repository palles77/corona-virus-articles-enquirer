Isolation and propagation of the pathogen in cell culture resulted in discovery of a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (tentatively named SeACoV) related to the bat coronavirus HKU2 identified in the same region a decade ago. Specific fluorescence signal was detected in Vero cells infected with SeACoV by using a positive sow serum collected in the same farm, but not by using TGEV-, PEDV-or PDCoV-specific antibody. Electron microscopy observation demonstrated that the virus particle with surface projections was 100-120 nm in diameter. Complete genomic sequencing and analyses of SeACoV indicated that the extreme amino-terminal domain of the SeACoV spike (S) glycoprotein structurally similar to the domain 0 of the alphacoronavirus NL63, whereas the rest part of S structurally resembles domains B to D of the betacoronavirus. The SeACoV-S domain 0 associated with enteric tropism had an extremely high variability, harboring 75-amino-acid (aa) substitutions and a 2-aa insertion, compared to that of HKU2, which is likely responsible for the extended host range or cross-species transmission. The isolated virus was infectious in pigs when inoculated orally into 3-day-old newborn piglets, leading to clinical signs of diarrhea and fecal virus shedding. These results confirmed that it is a novel swine enteric coronavirus representing the fifth porcine coronavirus.",

CoVs infect humans, other mammals, and birds, causing subclinical or respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases (de Groot et al., 2011; Woo et al., 2012) . As of date, three types of swine enteric CoVs (SeCoVs): transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), have been identified to induce clinical diarrhea in young pigs (Jung et al., 2016; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) . In particular, emergences of variant PEDV fatal to newborn piglets in China in late 2010 (Pan et al., 2012) , and later in the United States in 2013 Tian et al., 2014) , have posed a serious threat to the pork industry. Most recently, several chimeric SeCoV strains with a TGEV genomic backbone replaced by a PEDV spike (S) gene were identified from swine fecal samples in Europe (Akimkin et al., 2016; Belsham et al., 2016; Boniotti et al., 2016) , implying that novel SeCoV pathogens could emerge by inter-CoV recombination under co-infection. The S gene encodes a glycoprotein, forming trimer projections on the viral surface, which is a major structural protein critical for CoV attachment and entry into the host cell (Hulswit et al., 2016) .",

For example, 21-aa substitutions and a 7-aa insertion in the amino-terminal domain (NTD) of the S glycoprotein of a murine hepatitis CoV (MHV) variant confer the ability to bind and in some cases infect cells of nonmurine species including swine cells (Schickli et al., 2004) . In this study, we report the isolation and genetic characterization of a novel swine enteric alphacoronavirus (tentatively named SeACoV), related to a bat enteric coronavirus, from a pig farm that reported newborn-piglet diarrhea in southern China in 2017. This is yet another example to corroborate that the extended host range of CoV, here from bat to pig, is likely associated with aa substitutions at the NTD of the S glycoprotein. Furthermore, we conducted a pilot experimental infection study with this novel SeACoV, confirming its infectivity and ability to induced clinical signs of diarrhea in piglets.",

Clinical signs of affected pigs were characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea (Fig. 1A) . The mortality rate was over 35% in piglets less than 10 days old during February-May 2017. In addition, the small intestine of the diseased pigs Y. Pan et al. Veterinary Microbiology 211 (2017) 15-21 displayed thin walls and contained yellow watery feces (Fig. 1B) , which was indistinguishable from that of PEDV infection described previously Pan et al., 2012) . Fecal and small intestinal samples collected from affected piglets in this farm were submitted to our labs at Zhejiang University and Hog Production Division of Wen's Foodstuffs Group, respectively, for routine laboratory diagnostics. Upon laboratory analysis by RT-PCR, RNA of PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV or porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), was not detected in these samples (data not shown). Other possibly known viral pathogens associated with piglet diarrhea such as porcine enterovirus, rotavirus or mammalian orthoreovirus (Qin et al., 2017) also could not be detected. Subsequently, samples were tested by a pan-CoV RT-PCR assay designed to amplify a conserved region of 251-bp in the ORF1b gene for all CoV members (Moes et al., 2005) . This test was positive for all the selected samples collected during February to May (data not shown). Sequencing of the PCR products revealed that they were 100% identical to the corresponding region (nucleotide [nt] positions 14024-14274) of four known bat enteric alphacoronavirus HKU2 strains (GenBank accession nos. EF203064 to EF203067) identified from Guangdong province and Hong Kong in 2004 and 2006 (Lau et al., 2007) . The prevalence rate of bat CoV HKU2 from these two regions was reported to be 10.9% (7/64) and 8.3% (29/348) in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus), respectively (Lau et al., 2007) . HKU2 infection associated with the other animal species has never been investigated. The results from pan-CoV RT-PCR detection indicated that an HKU2like viral pathogen might be responsible for outbreaks of diarrhea in the pig farm.",

Cultured supernatants from each inoculated cell line were blind-passaged serially. From Vero cell culture, we successfully isolated one SeACoV strain with CPE characterized by syncytia formation at 48 h post-infection, beginning from passage two (P2) and in the following passages after plaque purification (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, viral antigens were demonstrated in SeACoV-infected Vero cells by IFA, with a serum sample collected from a sow mothering the diseased piglets (Fig. 1D ), but not with the specific monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of PEDV, TGEV or PDCoV (Fig. 2) , suggesting that SeACoV are probably antigenetically distinct from the three known porcine CoVs. SeACoV antibody-negative sera from the same farm were also found, as staining with these sera in SeACoV-infected cells displayed no fluorescent signal (Fig. 1E) . Electron microscopy of a negatively stained sample from the supernatant of virus-infected Vero cells demonstrated that the virus particle was 100 to 120 nm in diameter, and had surface projections typical of CoV (Fig. 1F) . SeACoV RNA was detected in supernatants from all virus passages to date (P2 to P8) by RT-PCR with primers SEAF and SEAR. The virus titer reached up to 1 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/ml at P8.

Furthermore, pairwise comparison of SeACoV genomic sequence with HKU2 indicated that the most dissimilar region was in the S gene, particularly, in the extreme NTD (aa 1-238). The entire SeACoV S protein had 86.4% aa identical with S of the HKU2/GD430 strain, but there was only a 67.4% identity in the extreme NTD of the S protein (S-NTD) between SeACoV and HKU2. We identified a total of 75-aa substitutions plus a 2-aa insertion (resulting from a 6-nt insertion as mentioned above) within the SeACoV S-NTD compared to HKU2. In contrast, only 78 aa substitutions were found in the remaining part of the S protein. The extreme NTD changes in SeACoV are likely to be associated with the extended host range, similar to a previously reported MHV variant that was able to expand nonmurine-species tropism, with the phenotype mapped to 21 substitutions and a 7-aa insert in NTD of S1 subunit (Schickli et al., 2004) . During the time of this manuscript preparation, a sequence of another HKU2-related SeACoV strain GDS04, identified in the same region, was reported online but it did not give in-depth analyses (Gong et al., 2017) . It remains unknown if GDS04 can be isolated in cell culture. Moreover, neither detection of serum anti-SeACoV antibodies nor observation of virus morphology was demonstrated. Nevertheless, comparative sequence analysis showed that the GDS04 strain, having the same genomic size (27,155 nt), shared 99.8% nt homology with GD-01/2017/P2 at the complete genome level. However, the GDS04 sequence was determined by the next generation sequencing, which should theoretically be less accurate than the GD-01/2017/P2 sequence determined based upon the consensus sequences from different short RT-PCR fragments covering the full-length genome. The S-NTD of GDS04 also contains 75-aa substitutions and a 2-aa insertion compared to that of HKU2. There are only three aa differences at the positions 86 (D/G), 166 (M/R) and 208 (A/V) in the S-NTD between GDS04 and GD-01/2017/P2. The corresponding aa in bat CoV HKU2 at these positions are G, M and M. For nonstructural protein genes analysis, the SeACoV GD-01/2017/P2 exhibited 99.8% and 97.7% nt identities, 99.8% and 97.5% nt identities, or 99.9% and 98.0% nt identities with GDS04 and HKU2 based on the ORF1ab, the ORF1a, or the ORF1b genes, respectively. These sequence analyses suggested that the SeACoV strains GD-01/2017 and GDS04 could have the same origin.",

            "text": "The S glycoprotein of SeACoV or HKU2 is unique and not related to any currently known betaCoVs at the aa sequence level. Most recently, the structures of several CoV S glycoprotein trimmers have been resolved (Walls et al., 2016a (Walls et al., , 2016b . The betaCoVs comprise of four domains (domains A-D) in the S1 subunit whereas human alphaCoV NL63 shows an additional domain, named domain 0 (equivalent to the extreme NTD) compared to betaCoVs (Fig. 3) . Therefore, a structure homology-modeling was performed in order to better understand the evolutionary origin of the S glycoprotein of SeACoV/HKU2 in the protein structure level. Surprisingly, the result suggested a hybrid structure of SeACoV-S: the extreme NTD (domain 0) of SeACoV-S is structurally similar to that of NL63, whereas the rest part in S1 structurally resembles domains B to D of the betaCoV MHV ( Fig. 3 and Supplemental Fig. S1 ). The S2 subunits of SeACoV and MHV also have a similar structure (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). The deduced structure of the linking region between domain 0 and domain B of SeACoV is uncertain. We hypothesize that the domain A is likely not present, which may be a unique feature of SeACoV/HKU2 S1 subunit. Since domain 0 and domain A are structurally similar and might come from a gene-duplication event (Walls et al., 2016b) , we also hypothesize that either of them is likely dispensable in the S1 of CoVs. In addition, the presence of domain 0 in SeACoV/HKU2 is in line with the enteric tropism of these viruses since PEDV and TGEV also possess this domain (Hulswit et al., 2016) . Future study on developing the SeACoV infectious clone and resolving the alphaCoV/betaCoV-hybrid SeACoV-S glycoprotein structure are warranted to confirm these findings.",

As expected, the five piglets in DMEM-inoculated group neither showed clinical sign nor shedding Y. Pan et al. Veterinary Microbiology 211 (2017) 15-21 virus in the feces throughout the experimental period (data not shown). In contrast, clinical signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea (similar to Fig. 1A) were observed in the five SeACoV-infected piglets at 27 to 40 h post-infection, and thereafter lasted until necropsy. Fecal virus shedding was detected in five SeACoV-infected pigs at 1, 2 and 3 dpi, and in three remaining pigs at 4 and 5 dpi by RT-PCR with the primers SEAF and SEAR (data not shown). Sequencing of the PCR products indicated that they were identical with the SeACoV N gene sequence, confirming that the infectious virus was originated from the SeACoV isolate. Upon histopathological analysis, no intestinal lesions were observed in control pigs (Fig. 5) ; the mean duodenal, jejunal and ileal VH/CD were 3.58 ( \u00b1 0.82), 6.14 ( \u00b1 1.55) and 4.70 ( \u00b1 1.73), respectively. Typical microscopic lesions, showing gradual atrophy with significantly reduced VH/CD (the mean jejunal or ileal value was 2.26 [ \u00b1 0.44] or 0.65 [ \u00b1 0.37]), diminishing capillaries and central lacteals of the intestinal villous (Fig. 5) , were detected in the jejunum and ileum of SeACoV-infected piglets. The duodenal sections displayed only mild microscopic lesions (the mean duodenal VH/CD = 2.59 [ \u00b1 0.27]) in all SeACoV-infected pigs (Fig. 5) . It was different from the result observed for the experimental infection using the virulent Chinese PEDV strain, in which marked microscopic lesions in all the three parts of the small intestine were found (Zhang et al., 2015) . The results indicated that the SeACoV isolate is actually infectious and causes diarrhea in pigs. Since the specific non-swine antibodies against the structural proteins of SeACoV are not available currently, further comprehensively pathological studies by immunohistochemistry and serological assays, which is not the scope of this study, are warranted to provide more information on SeACoV infection.",

The isolated SeACoV can actually infect and cause diarrhea in pigs, and should represent the fifth porcine coronavirus in addition to PEDV, TGEV (considering that porcine respiratory virus, PRCV, is a variant of TGEV), PDCoV and PHEV. To our knowledge, this is also the first study describing SeACoV related to the bat coronavirus HKU2 that could be isolated and propagated in cell culture. However, infection of Vero cells (a monkey cell line) with SeACoV also raises concerns about its potential host range other than swine. We also identified that the extreme NTD (aa 1-238) of SeACoV spike protein consists of 75-aa substitutions and a 2-aa insertion compared to that of HKU2, which is likely to be responsible for the cross-species transmission. Moreover, this region but not the other betaCoV-related domains of SeACoV S1 subunit is structurally similar to the alphaCoV domain 0, implying that these viruses gained enteric tropism through this domain. The results provide much needed information on SeACoV and HKU2 evolution, and the availability of SeACoV in cell culture will guide future efforts to develop effective vaccines against SeACoV. 5 . Representative histological examinations of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum samples collected at 3 days post-infection from piglets inoculated with SeACoV or DMEM in the animal challenge experiment. Sections of jejunum and ileum in the SeACoVinfected group showed scattered areas of villi atrophy, whereas the section of duodenum showed mild microscopic lesions as compared to the DMEM control group.",
