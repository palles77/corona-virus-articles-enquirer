The purpose of this study was to characterize the infectious diseases carried by clinically affected cats and to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections among cats in large-scale cat hoarding investigations. Records were reviewed retrospectively from four large-scale seizures of cats from failed sanctuaries from November 2009 through March 2012. The number of cats seized in each case ranged from 387 to 697. Cats were screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in all four cases and for dermatophytosis in one case. A subset of cats exhibiting signs of upper respiratory disease or diarrhea had been tested for infections by PCR and fecal flotation for treatment planning.",

The seroprevalence of FeLV and FIV were 8% and 8%, respectively. In the one case in which cats with lesions suspicious for dermatophytosis were cultured for Microsporum canis, 69/76 lesional cats were culturepositive; of these, half were believed to be truly infected and half were believed to be fomite carriers. Cats from large-scale hoarding cases had high risk for enteric and respiratory infections, retroviruses, and dermatophytosis. Case responders should be prepared for mass treatment of infectious diseases and should implement protocols to prevent transmission of feline or zoonotic infections during the emergency response and when transferring the rescued cats to other shelters or to adopters.",

            "text": "Responses to suspected large-scale cruelty cases often consist of both forensic and animal rescue components. During the animal rescue, animals are often triaged onsite and then transported to a temporary shelter to await their legal disposition. If the owner loses legal custody of the animals, they might be adopted, transferred to other agencies, or euthanased. Historically, the high prevalence of infectious diseases and lack of socialization of cats seized in largescale cases often resulted in mass euthanasia in shelters already crowded by pet overpopulation. 1,2 In recent years, responding agencies have invested in the physical and behavioral rehabilitation of seized animals to reduce their euthanasia. 3 This has increased the number of animals eventually placed in homes and the cost of intervening in suspected cruelty cases. The costs have exceeded $1-2 million 4 in the largest cases. 5, 6 Medical conditions complicate the long-term sheltering and adoption of seized animals. Infectious diseases pose a risk to other animals in the shelter and potentially to pets in the community. Some infections could have zoonotic risk to both shelter staff and potential adopters. Knowledge of conditions commonly present in large-scale cruelty investigations would assist with planning for the care of seized animals, including ordering of medical supplies, preparation of shelter protocols, and eventual placement of the animals. Although media reports frequently cite high disease rates from such cases, there are no detailed descriptions of diseases diagnosed in cats seized in cruelty investigations. 5, 7 From November 2009 through March 2012, more than 2000 cats were removed from four cat sanctuaries following reports consistent with animal hoarding. In each case, veterinarians performed intake examinations and screened for infectious diseases as needed to guide treatment decisions for ill cats and to segregate infectious cats housed in temporary shelters. The purpose of this study was to examine the available records of cats removed during the four large-scale cruelty investigations to characterize the infectious diseases of cats with respiratory and gastrointestinal signs and to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections.",

The paired swabs from each cat were placed together in a sterile dry polystyrene vial for pooled analysis and labeled with pertinent specimen identification information such as specimen collection date, animal identification, and agency name. Fresh latex gloves were worn during specimen collection for each cat and the vial containing the paired swabs was placed in an individual plastic self-sealing bag to reduce cross-contamination prior to testing.

FHV persists as a latent infection in cats and can recrudesce during periods of stress . As a consequence of stress and crosscontamination, FHV is the most prevalent viral pathogen in cats with acute URI in traditional short-term shelter housing (Bannasch and Foley, 2005; Veir et al., 2008; McManus et al., 2014) . In contrast to cats in short-term shelters, foster programs, or trap-neuterreturn programs, cats housed long-term in sanctuaries are more likely to be infected with FCV than FHV, similar to the findings of cats from the cases in this report (McManus et al., 2014) . The high prevalence of FCV among cats with URI is concerning because of considerable strain variability in its pathogenicity, transmissibility, and environmental stability and its association with a wide array of clinical signs including fever, conjunctivitis, oral ulceration, limping, ocular and nasal discharge, and gingivostomatitis (Reubel et al., 1992; Dawson et al., 1994; Pedersen et al., 2000; Radford et al., 2007; Gerriets et al., 2012) . The reason for the shift from high prevalence of FHV in cats in short-term shelter housing to high prevalence of FCV in cats in long-term group-housed confinement is unknown (Reubel et al., 1992; Lommer and Verstraete, 2003; Dowers et al., 2010) .",

SEZ was reported as the causative agent of death in 78 cats from June 2006 to January 2008 in an Israeli cattery (Blum et al., 2010) . The common finding of SEZ in cats in large-scale cases could explain in part why URI appears to be more severe and even deadly in such circumstances, in contrast to the milder and self-limiting URI commonly associated with cats in short-term shelters in which SEZ does not appear to be commonly involved. SEZ is likely an underrecognized cause of severe disease in cats since screening is not currently included in routine laboratory test panels, and the clinical presentation is different to the dramatic hemorrhagic respiratory disease observed in dogs. B. bronchiseptica is a Gram-negative bacterium considered to be a primary respiratory pathogen of cats found most commonly in high-density housing environments such as shelters or sanctuaries (Helps et al., 2005; Egberink et al., 2009) . Clinical signs vary in severity from mild sneezing and ocular discharge to pneumonia and death (Willoughby et al., 1991; Welsh, 1996; Speakman et al., 1999) . C. felis is currently recognized as primarily an ocular pathogen causing conjunctivitis but continues to be isolated from cats with respiratory tract disease. Reported infection rates range from 1% to 5% of cats without signs of URI to 10-30% of cats with conjunctivitis or URI (Wills et al., 1988; Gruffydd-Jones et al., 1995; Sykes et al., 1999; Low et al., 2007; McManus et al., 2014) .",

The diagnosis, management, and adoption of cats infected with T. foetus can be difficult in a shelter setting.

PCR testing should be repeated after treatment is finished to assure treatment success.

Due to prior difficulties in managing dermatophytosis cases in temporary shelters, in case 4 all cats were dipped in limesulfur at intake to decrease the overall spore burden in the shelter and to reduce in-shelter transmission of disease. Cats that exhibited lesions suspected to be dermatophytosis were immediately segregated.

It is also an ideal empirical treatment for many commonly encountered conditions in cats seized from hoarding cases, including wounds, pyoderma, and otitis. Unfortunately, cefovecin is ineffective against other common bacterial pathogens encountered in cats with URI, such as M. felis, B. bronchiseptica, and C. felis. This means that effective treatment of cats with URI often requires combination therapy with other antibiotics such as doxycycline. Doxycycline should not be used alone for therapy however, as SEZ isolates are frequently resistant to doxycycline (Chalker et al., 2012) .",

Currently, intervention strategies tend to center on emergency management of individual situations, and there is little follow-up or transparency regarding case outcomes. Prospective research is needed to more fully characterize the infectious diseases present in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cats and the effectiveness of preventive care and treatment protocols. Additional topics deserving attention include the management of stress and pain in seized cats, the characterization and management of common noninfectious conditions, and the long-term outcomes of the cats. Case managers should prioritize these factors during incident response planning. This will enable the development of best-practice guidelines and cost:benefit analyses to guide responders across the industry and to continuously improve outcomes for rescued cats.",
