            "text": "Many first-time wheezers also present to the ED. Most instances of wheezing in young children presenting to the ED are solely related to upper respiratory infections (URI) causing inflammation of the lower airways rather than true asthma. 6 The majority of early wheezers do not go on to develop asthma in later childhood or adulthood. 6, 7 This distinction is an important one, as it can affect the efficacy of certain therapeutic options. 8 Clues that increase the likelihood that the wheezing is due to asthma include the frequency of episodes (more than once a month), triggers (exercise, allergens, tobacco smoke), prolonged respiratory symptoms in the setting of URI (symptoms lasting more than 10 days suggest a viral trigger of asthma), personal or family history of atopy or asthma, and a history of a good and rapid response to bronchodilator therapy. 3, 6, 9 Other historical features of the patient that may aid in predicting the severity of the asthma exacerbation include the frequency and compliance in using asthma medications at home, previous hospital visits for asthma exacerbations (requiring admission to the ward or intensive care unit [ICU]), and severity of asthma exacerbations (requiring intubation). Social attributes of the patient and caregivers, such as the ability to purchase medications and comply to their use, a household environment free of known or suspected asthma triggers, and ability to obtain follow-up and access medical services in the event of another exacerbation, have important discharge planning implications and should be elicited early. 2, 3, 7, 9 The physical examination may reveal any combination of the classic constellation of symptoms in the acute asthma exacerbation, which includes wheezing, cough, chest tightness, tachypnea, respiratory distress, intercostal indrawing, and accessory muscle use. 3, 7, 9 Of interest, the use of the scalene muscles and suprasternal retractions have the highest interrater reliability and correlation with asthma severity. 10 Clinical asthma assessment tools, such as the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM; Table 1 ) 10, 11 and the Pediatric Asthma Severity Score (PASS), 12 have been independently shown to be predictive in discriminating a patient's length of stay in the hospital and admission. 10, 12 The strength of these two scales is that they include preschool-aged children, in comparison with older severity scales such as the Pulmonary Index and the Pulmonary Score, which are only validated in older, school-aged children. [10] [11] [12] A recent head-to-head comparison of the two scores showed very similar performance in their ability to predict a prolonged stay (>6 hours) and/or admission when taken at triage. 13 However, a repeat score taken 90 minutes after treatment showed that the PRAM score was more responsive and predictive (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve 0.82 vs 0.72). 13 These tools can be particularly useful when integrated into protocolized treatment regimens. 2, 9, 14 Investigations should include measurement of oxygen saturation, with more severe exacerbations deserving continuous monitoring. A blood gas sample may be useful in severe exacerbations in addition to clinical signs to determine respiratory function and responsiveness to therapy. In particular, normocarbia or hypercarbia in a patient after a round of standard treatment is a worrisome sign. 3, 9 Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is an objective method of assessing the degree of airway obstruction. However, it is often exceedingly difficult (if not impossible) to obtain these measurements in children younger than 6 years, and even with a cooperative child the measurements may not be reliable in an acute exacerbation. 15, 16 If PEF values are obtained, suggested categories include mild (PEF >80% predicted), moderate (PEF 60%-80% predicted), or severe (PEF <60%), 2 though different governing bodies have varying values. 3, 9 Additional blood work and imaging only aid in excluding complications or other diagnoses based on clinical suspicion, 3, 9 and are not routinely recommended.",

            "text": "Children with acute exacerbations should be rapidly assessed and triaged to a location in the ED where observation and frequent reassessment can be performed by medical and nursing staff. Reassessment of patients after each round of treatment is by far the most important aspect in the management of acute asthma exacerbations. Children, and especially infants, are particularly at risk for respiratory failure. Hypoxemia develops more rapidly in children than in adults; therefore monitoring of oxygen saturation is necessary. 3, 9 Oxygen should be administered only to maintain a saturation of greater than 92%-94%, 3, 9 as indiscriminate high-flow oxygen despite good saturations can lead to poorer outcomes. 17 Short-acting b-agonist (SABA) treatment is the most effective method of relieving bronchospasm, and should be given to all patients with asthma exacerbations. 3, 9 SABA can be administered as either intermittent therapy spaced 15 to 20 minutes apart via wet nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a holding chamber, or as continuous therapy via a nebulizer. 18, 19 In mild to moderate asthma, an MDI has been shown to be at least equivalent if not better in efficacy than a nebulizer in infants, children, and adults, [20] [21] [22] [23] and is more cost effective. 24 Factors that influence the choice of MDI versus nebulizer include patient cooperation, response to treatment via MDI, and severity of the exacerbation. Salbutamol (albuterol, Ventolin) 2 to 4 puffs, can be given every 15 minutes via MDI with chamber, waiting 5 tidal volume breaths between puffs. 3, 9 More puffs can be administered (up to 10) in more resistant exacerbations. Salbutamol can also be given at 0.15 to 0.3 mg/kg via nebulizer, with a minimum of 2.5 mg and maximum of 5 mg per nebulized mask. This volume is then diluted with normal saline for a total of 5 mL of fluid per nebulized mask. The most severe exacerbations may benefit from continuous therapy 19 with a nebulizer driven by oxygen if hypoxia is also present. 3, 9, 17 With continuous nebulization, salbutamol is recommended to be given at 0.5 mg/kg/h with the hourly dose not exceeding 10 to 15 mg/h. 3 Levosalbutamol ((R)-salbutamol, also known as levalbuterol) is the pure (R)-enantiomer of the salbutamol molecule. In a typical salbutamol preparation, there is a 50:50 mixture of the (S)-and (R)-enantiomers, and it is the (R)-enantiomer that provides the vast majority of the bronchodilating effects, due to its 100-fold higher affinity for the b2-adrenergic receptor. The selectivity of levosalbutamol theoretically maximizes the bronchodilating effects while minimizing systemic side effects such as tachycardia 25 and hypokalemia. 26 Small trials have shown mixed results, with some trials showing benefit in pulmonary function, 27, 28 reduction in hospital admission rates, 29 and reduced side effects 26, 30 ; whereas other studies have shown no difference. 30, 31 Levosalbutamol is considerably more expensive than the conventional racemic mixture, and current guidelines do not recommend using one over the other. The dose of levosalbutamol is half that of salbutamol.",

There are small studies analyzing the ability of NPPV to avoid intubation Common Pediatric Respiratory Emergencies and improve outcomes in children with status asthmaticus, 70-75 and a Cochrane review showed a trend toward benefit. 76 If the patient is unable to tolerate NPPV and continues to deteriorate, endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation is necessary. 3, 9 Once the decision has been made, the most experienced physician should make the attempt, as asthmatic patients are often difficult to intubate and desaturate quickly. Traditionally the induction agent of choice is ketamine (1-2 mg/ kg IV) because of its mild bronchodilating properties, 77 though the clinical significance of this bronchodilation is questionable, 77, 78 and several trials using ketamine infusion as an adjunct in status asthmaticus have shown no benefit. 78, 79 Ketamine can also increase oral and airway secretions 80 and trigger laryngospasm, and should be used in conjunction with a paralytic agent to counteract this possibility. 81 Other choices for induction include etomidate (0.3 mg/kg IV) and propofol (1.5-3 mg/kg IV). The paralytic agent of choice depends on patient characteristics, the presence of contraindications to particular agents, and physician preference and experience.",

The infection then spreads down to the larynx and subglottic area, causing cough and inflammation and edema of the upper airway and leading to varying degrees of obstruction.

Children from age 2 to 5 years with similar symptoms rarely have bronchiolitis, as asthma, recurrent viral wheeze, or pneumonia are more likely diagnoses. Wheezing is the hallmark of the American definition of bronchiolitis, where British and Australian definitions include inspiratory crackles as part of the diagnosis. 125, 126 Most studies and guidelines define bronchiolitis as the first episode of wheezing or crackles. As the presentations of bronchiolitis, viral-associated wheeze, and asthma may appear similar, attention to the features of patients becomes very important given differing pathophysiology and responses to treatment. 125 RSV continues to be the most common cause, responsible for approximately 50% to 80% of cases. The epidemiology of bronchiolitis follows closely that of RSV. A strongly seasonal virus, RSV causes outbreaks most commonly between November and March in the northern hemisphere and between May and September in the southern hemisphere. Up to half of infected children younger than 2 years will have lower respiratory tract symptoms, whereas older children and adults are more likely to have upper tract disease only. Peak age for bronchiolitis is 2 to 6 months old, with most cases occurring before age 9 months. Reinfection with RSV is common, given poor postinfection immunity.",

Although often taken in patients being admitted, the use of an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) to predict bacterial superinfection in this setting has been shown to be unreliable. A study of 1920 patients with confirmed RSV infection showed that the WBC was unable to distinguish between those with and without serious bacterial infection. 143 WBC can also be significantly elevated in the setting of adenovirus infections. 144 Coinfection should be considered in cases with unexpectedly high or prolonged fevers. Otitis media has been reported to be the most common coinfection with RSV, in the range of 53% to 62%. 130 Although the possibility of RSV etiology is possible in individual cases, bacterial isolation has been shown to be extremely common in this scenario and should be treated as such. The literature has also addressed the issue of the extent of workup necessary in infants 1 to 90 days old with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. It has been shown that the incidence of serious bacterial illness (SBI) is lower compared with controls without the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, 145 though a full septic workup is still recommended for patients younger than 1 month. In two case series of 42 and 187 children having blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures sent despite the diagnosis of bronchiolitis, no cases of septicemia or meningitis were found and the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the latter study was 2%. One study of 282 infants younger than 60 days with bronchiolitis showed a 1.5% incidence of SBI including 3 UTI, 1 pneumococcal bacteremia, and 1 meningitis; however, the clinical presentations included shock, apnea/cyanosis, hypothermia, and resolving pneumonia. 146 These studies together suggest that the yield of a full septic workup in this scenario is very low, including the yield of urine culture, and that antibiotics should be used sparingly and with clear indications. 147 One notable caveat to this is that several studies have documented significantly higher rates of bacterial coinfection (mainly bacterial pneumonia) in bronchiolitic patients ill enough to require admission to the ICU, 148,149 so further testing in this population is likely warranted.",

[150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] Supportive care measures such as suctioning, supplemental oxygen, hydration, and respiratory monitoring remain the current cornerstones of treatment. Nasal suctioning is an easy, useful adjunctive treatment that may improve respiratory status, given the significant secretions in many younger infants who are obligate nose breathers; it is recommended before feeds. 157 No evidence currently exists to support deeper airway suctioning. Oxygen should be administered for saturation less than 90% according to American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines, 130 and is an option in those with saturations of 90% to 94% and moderate signs of respiratory distress. 157, 158 Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation or intubation is indicated for those rare cases presenting with respiratory failure. IV hydration is necessary for those with dehydration and feeding difficulty. Attention to the risk of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is necessary. Chest physiotherapy has been well studied in the inpatient setting and has not been shown to improve short-term clinical scores or hospital course, and is therefore discouraged. 130, [157] [158] [159] The benefit of bronchodilators such as epinephrine and salbutamol is controversial. A recent Cochrane review of more than 1912 infants showed no significant effect of bronchodilators on O 2 saturation, hospital admission rate, length of stay, and disease duration. 160 There was a small improvement in clinical scores in the outpatient studies; however, the clinical significance of this is questionable. Another systematic review included 48 trials using bronchodilators (and/or steroids). 151 Only epinephrine use was found to decrease hospital admissions on day 1 by 33% compared with placebo (relative risk [RR] of 0.67 with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.50-0.89). This figure translates into a number needed to treat of 15 for epinephrine to avoid 1 hospitalization (95% CI 10-45). However, a 2004 Cochrane review found the benefit of nebulized epinephrine in inpatients to be unproven. 150 Future studies will likely clarify the role of nebulized epinephrine ED treatments.",

            "text": "In a much debated study, the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) group published a multicenter ED study of a series of 800 patients who were treated with nebulized epinephrine, dexamethasone, neither, or both, and outcome measures such as risk of hospitalization at 1 week were documented. 164 Unexpectedly, the combined treatment of inhaled epinephrine and dexamethasone demonstrated a significantly reduced admission rate versus placebo at day 7 (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.95). Improvements in breathing and feeding were noted on subsequent days, without harmful outcomes. However, given the high doses of dexamethasone used (1 mg/kg day 1, 0.6 mg/kg days 2-6) and its potential side effects, lack of efficacy of dexamethasone alone, and the lack of other supporting studies, this treatment option needs further validation. Evidence for treatment synergy as well as rationale for potential efficacy via targeting various aspects of the pathophysiology of the disease exists. 126 Nebulized hypertonic (3%) saline has emerged over the last decade as a potentially promising inpatient therapy for bronchiolitis. Given its proposed actions on improving clearance of mucus and cellular debris, initial studies in the setting of cystic fibrosis showed some benefit. 165 Multiple studies and a 2010 Cochrane review 155 have revealed that nebulized hypertonic saline consistently improves post-inhalation clinical scores and decreases length of stay in hospital by approximately 25% or 0.94 days. 166 In contrast to the inpatient data whereby nebulized hypertonic saline is given at intervals of every 8 hours or less over several days, ED studies using 1 to 3 consecutive doses with a bronchodilator have not to date shown statistically significant improvement in short-term clinical scores, nor decreased hospitalization rates (although trends to these outcomes are suggested and decreased severity is found at 24-72 hours). 135, 151, 155, 162, 166, 167 Nebulized hypertonic saline may need to be given at adequate intervals, dose, and duration for a significant treatment benefit to be seen. It may also be possible that ED initiation followed by continuation of treatment may lead to later benefits in hospital. Further research is currently under way to better establish and clarify the roles of nebulized hypertonic saline in both the outpatient and inpatient settings.",

            "text": "Although the classic presenting symptoms of fever, productive cough, dyspnea and chest pain can assist the ED practitioner in recognizing pneumonia, children may have less typical presentations that require a higher level of suspicion and discernment. Neonates and infants may simply present with lethargy, poor feeding, or irritability. Atypical pneumonias may present with predominantly upper respiratory tract or systemic symptoms such as malaise, headache, vomiting, or rash. Neck pain and, rarely, meningismus may be a manifestation of an upper lobe consolidative process. Abdominal pain is a not uncommon presenting symptom of pneumonia in children, although usually cough, fever, or other symptoms of a URI are present. 174 Fever without a localizable source may be a less common presentation, but is well described. The World Health Organization guidelines advocate measurement of respiratory rate as an important initial guide to suspecting pneumonia. These guidelines suggest thresholds of RR greater than 60 in infants younger than 2 months, RR greater than 50 in infants 2 to 12 months old, RR greater than 40 in children 1 to 5 years old, and RR greater than 30 in children older than 5 years 175,176 as a simple tool that may help detect as many as 50% to 80% of pneumonias. Respiratory rates should be counted for a full minute when the child is calm. However, studies show the specificity of tachypnea in developed countries is reportedly low in infants under 6 months (39%) compared with older children up to age 5 years (67%). 177 Tachypnea beyond agespecific limits was found in 61% of children under 2 years old and in 26% of those patients older than 2 years in another study of radiographically confirmed pneumonia, 178 underscoring the limits of using tachypnea alone to predict pneumonia.",
