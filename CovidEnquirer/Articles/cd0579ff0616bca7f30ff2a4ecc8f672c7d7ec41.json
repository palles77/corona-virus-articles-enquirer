Most FeLV-negative lymphomas have neither exogenous integrated FeLV proviruses nor viral structure antigens (Casey et al., 1981) . Nevertheless, FeLV may contribute to the genesis of some FeLV-negative lymphomas. Nonproducer lymphomas are more common in cats from FeLV-positive households (Hardy et al., 1980a,b) , and lymphomatous cats have a higher incidence of latent, reactivatable, bone marrow FeLV infection than do cats with extinguished FeLV infections (see p. 69). Furthermore, lymphomas from some virus-negative cats contain truncated FeLV sequences or viral structural proteins (Fulton et al., 1987; Rezanka et al., 1987) .",

Viremic cats display unusual sensitivity to viral pathogens and succumb to infectious peritonitis (corona) virus (FIPV) and have chronic or recurrent herpetic rhinitis and sinusitis. Viremic cats also are uniquely susceptible to nonviral opportunists and may die of antibiotic-unresponsive enteritis, gingivitis, stomatitis (noma), dermatitis, pneumonia, or septicemia of bacterial origin. FeLV-positive cats also may develop fatal hemotropic hemobartonellosis or systemic toxoplasmosis (Cotter et al., 1975) . Even ostensibly healthy viremic pet cats demonstrate lymphopenia, persistent or cyclic neutropenia, and fluctuating levels of serum complement and immune complexes Kobilinsky et al., 1979; Swenson et al., 1987) .

The envelope glycoproteins are highly immunogenic; especially the amino terminus gp70 component. Antibodies may be induced that are directed to both subgroup-specific components as well as to all FeLVs.

Presumably this occurs because cats are one of the only outbred mammalian species where a retrovirus is replicating at high levels, with provirus moving in and out of the cell chromosome. Such high level replication results in more frequent transduction of cellular DNA sequences. When such cell sequences represent a c-onc gene with potential for cell transformation, solid tumors occur. The newly created viral genomes are replication defective because the acquired cell genes must displace some required virus replication genes to fit in the viral genome. However because such viruses are generated in a milieu of FeLV helper virus-infected tissues, transmission of FeSV from one cell to another occurs. The result is the development of multicentric polyclonal tumors that develop and progress very rapidly. Oncogenes that have been recognized in naturally occuring feline fibrosarcomas include fes (Snyder and Theilen, 1969) , fins (McDonough et al., 1971) , sis (Parodi et al., 1973) , fgr , ras (Youngren et al., 1984) , kit (Besmer et al., 1986) , and abl . The myc oncogene has also been detected in a significant number of recombinant FeLVs that were isolated from cats with naturally occurring leukemia or lymphoma (Levy et al., 1984; Mullins et al., 1984; Neil et al., 1984) , suggesting that transduction of c-myc could be an important mechanism by which retroviruses induce leukemia under natural conditions.",

Recent evidence suggests that its in vivo behavior in critical target hemolymphatic tissues is as likely to be cytopathic as transforming. Replication in both fibroblasts and lymphocytes is initiated by the binding of FeLV gp70 to subgroup-specific cellular receptors demonstrated by interference and direct receptor assays (Sarma and Log, 1973; Hamilton et al., 1987a,b) . Hence, cell-surface FeLV receptors often determine the host range of FeLV isolates. As discussed herein, hypervariability and recombination in the N-terminus of gp70 are responsible for division of FeLV isolates into three subgroups: A, B, and C. On feline fibroblasts, receptors for FeLV-A and FeLV-C are equivalent in frequency and twice as common as receptors for FeLV-B. Replication of all subtypes is usually persistent and highly productive. In contrast, heterologous cells usually bind FeLV-B. Replication of FeLV-B is persistent and productive in mink MvlLu cells and hamster E36 cells but abortive in African green monkey vero cells. Surprisingly, guinea pig cells preferentially bind FeLV-C, and replication is persistent and productive. Mouse cells neither bind nor replicate FeLV.",

Persistent viremia is diagnosed by either fixed cell immunofluorescence for FeLV p27-positive cells or by isolation of helper FeLV in S + L -assay (Hardy et al., 1976) . Chronic productive infection often is accompanied by persistent antigenemia and free p27 antigen is detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Mia et al., 1981) .",

The ecotropic FeLV-A is the most frequent subgroup found in pet cats and is transmitted contagiously ( Jarrett et al., 1978a,b) . FeLV-A is related to endogenous rat genomic sequences and probably entered the ancestral cat population in Northern Africa one to ten million years ago. The contagious spread of FeLV-A may have been restricted by the climatic aridity of the North African desert, by the intrinsic independence of cats in nature and by the lessened viability and fertility of viremic cats. Throughout the millenia, FeLV-A and its feline host may have evolved together. FeLV-A, by itself, has minimal pathogenicity. Molecularly cloned FeLV-As induce viremia readily but rarely cause disease (Luciw et al., 1986; Mullins and Hoover, 1987) . As discussed previously, the majority of receptors on feline bone marrow and lymphoid cells are for FeLV-A. Thus, it is logical that FeLV-A is the most contagious subgroup in nature and the most frequent subgroup isolated from both viremic and latent infections. Cats viremic with FeLV-A alone may be healthy for years and experience transient subclinical lymphopenia only. Alternatively, these cats may by immunosuppressed due to the presence of circulating pl5E and die of opportunistic infection in the preneoplastic period. Cats viremic with FeLV-A develop lymphoma or other diseases three or more years after becoming viremic. When these diseases occur, they may be the result of second (cocarcinogenic) events like the emergence of variant or recombinant FeLVs or the activation or transduction of cat cellular genes against a background of FeLV-Acaused immunosuppression (see p. 86). Hence, FeLV-A viremia may increase the likelihood that secondary events leading to disease will occur.",

One third of cats have a scarcity of leukocyte receptors for FeLV-C (previously discussed); lymphocytes from these low responders replicate FeLV poorly in vitro (Hamilton et al., 1987b) . Experimentally, cats are only susceptible to the induction of persistent FeLV-C viremia if exposed immediately after birth, if simultaneously exposed to immunosuppressive corticosteroids, or if previously made viremic with FeLV-A (Onions et al., 1982; Kociba et al., 1982; Jarrett et al., 1984; Riedel et al., 1986b) . In nature, FeLV-C is recovered only when FeLV-A is also present . The dominant routes of FeLV-C transmission, therefore, are probably via de novo generation and phenotypic mixing. Importantly, once the cat begins to replicate FeLV-C in bone marrow cells, it is destined to develop fatal erythroid aplasia within 3 weeks to 3 months (Onions et al., 1982; Jarrett et al., 1984; Riedel et al., 1986b) . Recent observations indicate that the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) is not a tumor-specific antigen but rather is derived from modified FeLV-C gp70 expressed at the surface of neoplastic and nonneoplastic cells (Vedbrat et al., 1983; Snyder et al., 1983) . In fact, FOCMA antibody lyses all cells expressing FeLV-C gp70 on their surface and neutralizes some FeLV-C virions directly. Monoclonal antibody analysis suggest that the FOCMA-related epitopes are present as defective, immature, or replication-incompetent FeLV-C particles. The critical role for FOCMA antibody in humoral immunosurveillance is unchanged (Essex et al., 1971a,b) ; apparently the cat recognizes a need to prevent FeLV-C from extended replication in vivo. By synthesizing antibody to FeLV-C gp70-related epitopes, the cat is able to protect itself against neoplastic disease (see p. 80).",

The major subgroup differences, therefore, reside principally in the envelope gene. Molecular constructs using the LTR of one subgroup linked to the envelope gene of another subgroup fail to support an influential role for the FeLV LTR in pathogenesis (Riedel et al., 1986b) , this is in contrast to studies in the mouse which suggest that virus competency is in part regulated by the LTR.

Interruption and fatal disruption of the a 1-collagen gene has been described for mouse embryos with endogen-ized Moloney MuLV proviruses (J\u00e4hner and Jaenisch, 1985) . Insertional mutagenesis by weakly transforming avian leukosis virus (ALV) isolated may lead to transcriptional activation of cellular proto-oncogene (c-onc) and eventual lymphomagenesis. Integration upstream to c-onc may generate a hybrid RNA (v-LTR-c-onc) and enhanced or constitutive expression of the one gene product. Integration downstream or in retrograde orientation may lead to one gene activation by viral enhancers. ALVs also frequently transduce c-onc from myeloid and fibroblastoid targets to generate acute transforming viruses. In the cat, activation of c-myc is infrequent in spontaneous lymphomas and myelogenous leukemias (Neil et aL, 1984; Busch et aL, 1983) . Rearrangement of c-myc occurs but may be restricted to thymic lymphomas induced by the Rickard strain of FeLV (FeLV-R, subgroups A, B). Transduction of c-myc is relatively frequent and occurs in about 29% (8/29; see Neil et aL, 1984; Levy et al, 1984; Mullins et aL, 1984) of spontaneous FeLV-positive, thymic lymphomas. Extensive testing of feline lymphomas in the NIH 3T3 transformation assay has failed to show transfer of any other activated feline oncogene (Neil et aL, 1984) .",

In another cloned FeLV-myc provirus, designated CT4, recombination at the pol-env junction generates an open reading frame whose w-myc gene can be expressed without fusion to proviral sequences (Stewart et aL, 1986b) . Both the LC and CT4 w-myc isolates retain the full length feline c-myc coding sequences from exons 2 and 3, but only a short, truncated, variant of exon 1. The FeLV-LC w-myc coding sequence reproduces the feline c-myc sequence faithfully whereas FeLV CT4 w-myc is changed at only 3 coding positions relative to c-myc. The cat w-myc genes do not have mutations in the putative DNA binding region that are characteristic of avian w-myc isolates (Stewart et al., 1986b) . While avian w-myc viruses transform a wide variety of target cells (B cells, macrophages, epithelia, fibroblasts), the feline isolates transform only T cells in vivo and fail to transform fibroblasts in vitro (ibid).

Experimental inoculation of these viruses into newborn kittens induces rapid onset of thymic lymphomas that are oligo-or monoclonal with respect to proviral integration patterns (D. E. Onions, personal communication) . The monoclonality of proviral integration suggest that FeLV-myc genes alone may be insufficient for lymphomagenesis. Rather, secondary selection could influence which transformed cells would evolve into the successful tumor. A likely second event is the transduction of another cellular gene intrinsic to lymphoid maturation. Such an event has been described for one spontaneous Scottish tumor in which FeLV has separately co-opted myc and the \u00df-chain of the T cell receptor (Ti/3) to generate defective separate FeLV-myc and FeLV-fcr proviruses (Fulton et al., 1987) . The proviral sequence is 5'LTR-gag-pol-tcr-env-3'LTR and the v-tcr insert reproduces the V-D-J-C sequence of the rearranged, joined and spliced Ti/3 gene. Exactly how the transduced v-tcr contributes to lymphoma development is not known. A nonconservative change (met-> lys 324) increased the positive charge of the predicted protein in the putative transmembrane region of the T3-T\u00ce/3 complex and alters its hydrophilicity. Changes in the T3-Ti\u00df complex may abrogate the requirement for an a : \u00df heterodimer in the formation of a functional surface T cell antigen receptor. Alternatively, an abnormal T3 : Ti/3 complex may be activated in the absence of specific antigen and hence under autonomous control for proliferation (Fulton et al., 1987) .",

The best understood tumors are the thymic lymphomas induced by FeLV-R. The tumors arise 7 months to 2 years after experimental inoculation, are terminal transferase-positive, have Tij\u00f6 chain rearrangements and are first apparent in the subcapsular region of the thymic cortex (Hoover et al., 1973; Rojko et al., 1987; Rezanka et al., 1987) . Tumor emergence is preceded by an increase in terminal transferase-positive cells and neoplastic lymphocytes in the bone marrow (Hoover et al., 1973; Lafrado et al., 1986b) . Thymectomy does not preclude lymphomagenesis; rather, T cell lymphomas develop in the extrathymic tissues (Hoover et al., 1975) . The transforming event may be the generation of recombinant FeLVs containing subgroup B env genes with MCF env homology (Elder and Mullins, 1983) . FeLV-R-induced lymphomas also show evidence of transduced or activated myc genes (Levy et al., 1984; Mullins et al., 1984; Neil et al., 1984) .",

Inoculation of biologically or molecularly cloned FeLV-C reproduces the disease in neonatal cats (Onions et al., 1982; Riedel et al., 1986a) . The principal lesion is the ablation of early (BFU-E) and late (CFU-E) erythroid progenitors (Onions et al, 1982; Boyce et al., 1981; Abkowitz et al., 1985) . The experimental disease in SPF cats mimics the disease in nature and the BFU-E are infected and disappear beginning at 10-days postinoculation (Onions et al., 1982; Testa et al., 1983) . CFU-E inhibition occurs by 3 to 6 weeks postinoculation and progressive aplastic anemia ensues (Boyce et al., 1981) . In safari cats (domestic cat X Geoffroy cat), CFU-E destruction is the principal lesion and the BFU-E are preserved (Abkowitz et al., 1985) . In vitro, replication-competent FeLV and purified pl5E impair both CFU-E and BFU-E development (Wellman et al., 1984; Rojko et al, 1986) . Antibody to FeLV-C gp70 and complement may further suppress infected BFU-E early in the disease process (Kociba et al., 1987) . Using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase h\u00e9t\u00e9rozygotes, Abkowitz et al., (1985) have determined that aplasia does not result from myelophthisis and the clonal expansion of a transformed myeloid stem cell. Interestingly, these same authors find that factors which promote BFU-E development are secreted by FeLV-infected fibroblasts (Abkowitz et al., 1986) .",

Presumably biting enhances the efficiency of transmission but the routine grooming that occurs in the absence of fighting is also probably important. Transmission is particularly efficient at the neonatal period, presumably due to some combination of maternal grooming and transmission of FeLV in milk. Transplacental transmission in utero does not appear to be as important as neonatal acquisition, despite the presence of infectious virus in blood. When transmission occurs during gestation it probably results in abortion and/or fetal r\u00e9sorption (Cotter et al., 1975) . Infection is considerably more efficient when cats are exposed at the youngest ages, but it is apparent that successful natural transmission can also occur between adults that are several years old. The induction period during which cats remain infected is usually many months or a few years. During this period the infected cats are regularly excreting infectious virus. In fact, healthy carrier cats probably excrete larger amounts of virus than leukemic animals (Francis et al., 1977) . They certainly play a more important role in the transmission cycle, in part because of their mobility and in part because they are usually healthy excretors for considerably longer periods than the duration of their illness.",

In natural and experimental infections, virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody to FeLV-A peaks about 6 to 8 weeks after exposure to FeLV. The delay is thought to reflect dilution by serum and consumption by FeLV-infected cells. Virus-neutralizing antibody to FeLV-B is less common and may be delayed in its appearance for months to years, probably consequent to the relative infrequency of FeLV-B in cats that regress FeLV-A infection. It is more common in multiple cat households with a high incidence of viremia with both FeLV-A and FeLV-B (Jarrett et al, 1978a ) VN antibody to FeLV-C gp70 is elicited early (within 2 to 4 weeks and in response to exposure to FeLV of any subgroup). VN antibody to FeLV-A and -B gp70 only neutralizes extracellular virus. In contradistinction, VN antibody to FeLV-C not only neutralizes extracellular virus but also binds to the surface of FeLV-infected cells, fixes complement and initiates complement-mediated cytolysis (Grant et al., 1983) . The antibodies critical to humoral immunosurveillance and complement-mediated cytolysis of feline lymphoma cells (see p. 80) apparently recognize surface buds of immature or replicationincompetent FeLV-C related material (Vedbrat et al., 1983; .",

Presumably these reactivities are evoked by FeLV budding from the surface of cat leukocytes in conjunction with feline leukocyte antigens (Grant and Michalek, 1981; Lee et al., 1982) . FeLV is known to bud from human lymphoblastoid cells in concert with HLA-A and HLA-B, but not HLA-DR, antigens (Azocar and Essex, 1979) . Furthermore, infection with FeLV elicits a humoral response to a normal cellular protein of 105,000 M r .

Some monoclonal antibodies recognize neutralization epitopes common to FeLV-B and -C, others specifically bind to a 14 amino acid sequence shared by all FeLV subgroup isolates. This sequence, Met-gly-pro-asn-leu-val-leu-pro-asp-gln-lyspro-pro-ser lies within a local peak of protein hydrophilicity midway in the gp70 molecule still within the N-terminal domain. This prolinerich region is not the receptor binding site (Hamilton et al., 1987a) and may rather function as a molecular hinge in the folding of the two-domain protein.

As discussed, antibody to FeLV-C gp70-related antigens fixes complement to trigger lysis of tumor cells. Experimental depletion of complement by treatment of cats with cobra-venom factor causes transient reactivation of latent FeLV infection. Upon restoration of hemolytic complement to normal levels, the cat again regresses productive FeLV infection and antibody titers to FeLV-C-related antigens show reactive increases. In contrast, experimental consumption of complement does not impair resistance in acute FeLV infection (Kraut et al, 1987) , and cat complement is inefficient at direct lysis of FeLV (Kobilinsky et al, 1980) . Also important is the observation that viremia, immune complex disease, and hypocoplementemia coexist in some cats and exacerbate FeLV-induced immunosuppression and, perhaps, lymphoma progression.",

The critical regulation of FeLV infection by complement-dependent antibody was discussed previously. Equally important is the relationship between FeLV and the feline macrophage . Kitten bone marrow and peritoneal macrophages are very susceptible to FeLV infection and produce high titers of replication-competent FeLV. Macrophages from adult cats replicate FeLV poorly and aid in viremia regression. Glucocorticoid treatment of adut cat macrophages shifts the host/virus relationship and permits the macrophages to replicate FeLV readily. In vivo, glucocorticoids abrogate age-related resistance to FeLV and enhance both initial susceptibility and reactivation of latent infection (Rojko et al., 1979b (Rojko et al., , 1982 Hoover et al., 1981) . Similarly, poisoning of adult cat macrophages with the macrophage toxin silica nullifies age-related resistance to FeLV in vivo.",

            "text": "Cats possess two types of cells with natural cytotoxic activity. Natural cytotoxic-like cells are present in peripheral blood and spleen, lyse virus-infected adherent monolayers and are not activated by viral infection. Natural killer-like cells are restricted to the spleen, lyse lymphoid tumor targets, and are maximally stimulated 6 days postviral infection (Tompkins et al., 1985) . Cats also possess a short-lived, nonimmune, peripheral blood cell responsible for the restriction of initial and latent FeLV infection (Rojko et al, , 1982 . The actual role of these cells in protection from viremia has not been determined and may be minimal (Kooistra et al., 1985) . FeLV pl5E specifically inhibits the natural lethal hit events that follow natural killer cell recognition and target-natural killer cell conjugation (Whisler et al., 1987) . Suppression of natural killer function does not require direct FeLV infection of effector cells and is partially nullified by (v) Interferon and IL-2 supplementation (Whisler et al., 1987) . The production of (\u03b3) interferon, a known activator of natural killer cells, also is depressed by pl5E (Engelman et al., 1986b) . The FeLV/interferon interaction is a two-edged sword; both human and cat interferons restrict late stages of FeLV replication (Jameson and Essex, 1984) . The administration of interferon to anemic viremic cats occasionally lead to partial remission of viremia and recovery from anemia (Tompkins and Cummins, 1982) . Lastly, interferon may regulate productivity of infection in lymphoblastoid cells (Azocar and Essex, 1979; Dubey et al., 1982; Lee et al., 1982) . In vitro, transformed T cells are more susceptible to productive FeLV infection than are transformed B cells. Infection with FeLV causes B cells normally resistant to natural killing to become sensitive and causes T cells normally sensitive to natural killing to become resistant. Inhibitors of interferon synthesis decrease natural killing of FeLV-infected B cells but increase natural killing of FeLV-infected T cells. These data indicate that interferon augments natural killing of FeLV-infected B cells only and that FeLV-infected, transformed T cells resist natural killing (Dubey et al., 1982) . If similar mechanisms operate in viremic cats, retroviral infection may enable transformed T cells to escape immunosurveillance. This may be relevant to the T cell tropisms for transformation of certain FeLV isolates (Dubey et al., 1982) .",

These cytotoxic T effectors arise by 7 days postimmunization, peak at 16 days, and disappear by 35 days. Recognition and killing are in response to a combination of FeLV and self antigens on the membrane of the autochthonous transformants (McCarty et al., 1983a) . Whether these cytotoxic effectors express the recently described feline cytotoxic antigen defined by monoclonal antibody (Klotz et al., 1986b) has not been determined. The feline histocompatibilityrestricted cytotoxic effectors that arise consequent to immunization with autochthonous transformants are distinct from the nonhistocompatibility-restricted cells which arise consequent to immunization with producer allogeneic lymphoma (FL74) cells. The latter probably are a mixture of T cells sensitized to alloantigens and natural killer cells.

Certain clones of FL74 cells, which replicate all three subgroups and express membrane FeLV-C gp70related antigens (Essex et al., 1971a,b; Vedbrat et al., 1983; were nonpathogenic and induced protective immunity in most cats older than 4 months of age. This resulted in the patenting of a live tumor cell vaccine in 1976 ( Jarrett et al, 1974 ( Jarrett et al, , 1976 . Research and development of this vaccine ceased due to aesthetic objections to the inoculation of live tumor cells and due to the observation that certain FL74 isolates were highly pathogenic, causing fatal anemias or lymphomas in neonatal kittens. Vaccines employing FL74 cells killed by formalin, heat or ultraviolet light had good immunogenicity and elicited antibodies to cell-associated FeLV-C gp70 moieties and sometimes VN antibodies. Killed tumor cell vaccines also induced protection against FeSV sarcomagenesis but evoked little defense against viremia. Vaccinated, virulent (FeSV) FeLV challenged cats died of FeLV-associated diseases (Yohn et al., 1976; Olsen et al, 1976; Heding et al, 1976) .",

Lewis and his colleagues (1985a,b; 1986) have examined the biochemical defects induced when the hydrophobic pl5E intercalates into the lipid bilayer of the lymphocyte membrane. Incorporation may interfere with the calcium/calmodulin transduction of membrane signals and the subsequent activation of adenyl cyclase in lymphocytes. This would be compatible with observations that FeLV contains calmodulin, that pl5E prohibits cyclic AMP accumulation by lymphocytes and that direct activation of adenyl cyclase by forskolin can override pl5E immunosuppression.

Interestingly, though, most viremic cats have inadequate suppressor cell function (Stiff and Olsen, 1983) . Such defects may facilitate the development of immune-medicated diseases such as Coomb's-positive hemolytic anemia, immune complex disease and membranous glomerulonephritis. Immune complexes which contain intact, infectious, virions as well as FeLV gp70, p27, pl5E, and antibodies to FeLV proteins form readily in the antigen-excess state of chronic viremia Kobilinsky et al., 1979) . Experimentally, immune complexes form early in the preleukemic period (Tuomari et al., 1984) . These small, soluble, antigen-antibody complexes circulate, lodge in tissues like the renal glomerulus, and elicit chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease. It also is possible that immune complexes contribute to the maintenance of the viremic state and to the progression of lymphomas. Removal of circulating immune complexes from viremic cats by extracorporeal immunosorption is reported to result in the reversal of viremia and the remission of lymphoma in some cats (Jones et al., 1984; Liu et al., 1984a) .",

Asymptomatic cats naturally infected with FeLV have a malfunctioning humoral immune response (Trainin et al., 1983; Wernicke et al., 1986) . The primary and secondary responses of these cats have been studied following stimulation with a synthetic antigen, namely the multichain poly (Tyr, Glu)-poly (Ala)-poly(Lys) denoted (T,G)-A-L. After both primary and secondary administration of antigen, the nonviremic control animals responded with increased levels of antibodies within 3 days after inoculation. In the FeLV-infected cats, lower and delayed levels of antibody responses were detected after primary antigenic stimulation. Furthermore, a second challenge with antigen evoked an increase of antibody production only after 9 days. Thus, the humoral antibody response of cats naturally infected with FeLV is diminished when they are exposed to a newly encountered antigen. The suppression of the secondary response was very dramatic in several of the viremic cats.",

These findings do not necessarily indicate a normal function of the immune response and may be an expression of an intense polyclonal B cell activation leading to high serum immunoglobulin levels, similar to observations made on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients (Lane et al., 1983) . (T,G)-A-L is a T cell dependent antigen (Mozes and Haimovich, 1979) . The mitogenic stimulus provided by activated T helper cells is necessary for vigorous B cell proliferation, when the triggering antigen is T cell dependent. In both the primary and the secondary immune responses, the B cells from FeLV-infected cats are capable of synthesizing antibodies to (T,G)-A-L after a considerable delay. Thus, a defect in the production or the release of helper factor which normally would stimulate B cell proliferation can also be considered. On the other hand, the observation that uninfected animals maintain a relatively high level of antibodies against (T,G)-A-L for more than 8 months after the first immunization, while the FeLV-infected animals do not, is compatible with impaired B cell longevity. Similar results on the humoral response of FeLV-infected pet cats have been obtained using sheep RBCs .",
