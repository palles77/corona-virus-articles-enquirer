Serologic studies demonstrated that the virus had not previously circulated in human populations to any large extent and suggested a source of zoonotic origin (2) (3) (4) . A likely natural viral reservoir for the virus was not identifi ed until horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) in several regions in the People's Republic of China were demonstrated to harbor SARS-like CoVs (5) . Subsequently, a number of other SARS-like CoVs, as well as CoVs from antigenic groups I and II, were identifi ed from bats in Asia, Europe, and North America, and coronavirus antibodies were detected in African bat species (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . It is not surprising that a growing number of CoVs have been detected in bats. To date, >60 viral species have been detected in bats because their biodiversity (second only to rodents), high population densities, wide distribution, and ability to fl y over long distances allow them to harbor and easily spread multiple infectious agents. Bats have long been known as natural hosts for lyssaviruses and more recently have been recognized as potential reservoirs for emerging human pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, and Hendra viruses in addition to SARS-CoV (12, 13) .",

The selection of sites was based on preliminary data regarding bat roost locations and observations of bats in the fi eld during the survey. Attempts were made to collect specimens from 10-20 animals of each species present in each location. Bats were captured manually and by using mist nets and hand nets; adults and subadults of both sexes were captured. Each bat was measured, sexed, and identifi ed to the genus or species level when possible. Blood samples and oral and fecal swabs were collected; the animals were then euthanized in compliance with fi eld protocol. Blood, fecal swabs, and selected tissue samples were transported on dry ice from the fi eld and stored at -80\u00b0C.",

The 121-bp sequences in these 5 clusters had an average nucleic acid (NA) sequence identity of 88%, 85%, 81%, 77%, and 80% when compared with the next closest previously characterized CoVs (i.e., BtCoV1A, BtHKU8, BtHKU7, HCoV229E, and BtCoVA970, respectively). The remaining 16 sequences would likely be placed into group 2. Two sequences from Chaerophon spp. bats (location 17) were closely related to a SARS-like CoV cluster, including 1 sequence shown in Figure 2 (BtKY15) and another (BtKY16) that was 1 of the 3 low-quality sequences excluded from the tree. These 2 NA sequences show \u224889% identity with the nearest previously characterized bat: SARS-like CoV, BtCoVRF1, shows \u224880% NA sequence identity to SARS CoV (Urbani strain) and \u224863% NA sequence identity to the human group 2 CoV HCoVOC43. The 15 remaining NA sequences were grouped into 2 clusters. One cluster contains the recently described BtHKU9 with >95% NA sequence identity, and the other cluster (BtKY18-like cluster) contains no other previously known CoVs, with <75% NA sequence identity to BtHKU9. The pattern of CoV detections by bat species and location demonstrates several features concerning coronaviruses in bats. A given bat species in the same location can harbor several distinct CoVs as noted for Chaerophon spp. (location 17), Miniopterus infl atus (location 5), and Rousettus aegyptiacus (location 2 and 16); similar CoVs can also been seen in the same type of bat in different locations, as noted for BtCoV1A-like cluster CoVs being detected in Miniopterus spp. bats of 4 species from different locations. One M. infl atus bat from location 5 harbored 2 different, but closely related, CoVs, 1 (BtCoV 36) from the BtCo-V1A-like cluster and 1 (BtCoV 35) from the BtHKU8-like cluster ( Figure 2 ). CoVs of these 2 closely related clusters were detected in Miniopterus spp. bats, but not detected in other bat genera, including those that shared roosts with Miniopterus spp. bats. This fi nding is consistent with studies from China in which BtCoV1A-like and BtHKU8-like CoVs were frequently identifi ed but only in Miniopterus spp. bats (15) . This may suggest that viruses of the BtCo-V1A-like cluster and the BtHKU8-like cluster are specifically adapted to Miniopterus spp. bats and not easily transmitted to other bat species.",

The extent of this diversity among CoVs may be shown more clearly through additional studies in bats, and increased demonstration of CoV diversity in bats may require a reconsideration of how they should be grouped. The frequency and diversity of CoV detections in bats, now in multiple continents, demonstrate that bats are likely an important source for introduction into other species globally. Understanding the extent and diversity of CoV infection in bats provides a foundation for detecting new disease introductions that may, like SARS, present a public health threat.",
