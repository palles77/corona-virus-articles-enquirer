Dallas was a Viet Nam war veteran who proudly wore his Viet Nam Vet baseball cap as he went about his work. My father, who had been a mobile Army surgical hospital surgeon in Viet Nam, and Dallas, began talking one day and they determined that they had been stationed in the same general vicinity at the same time. Dallas had been badly wounded on 2 occasions and as it turns out, the care he received was at the same unit where my father was based. Over the years, they developed a friendship, and when my father retired as Chair of Surgery, Dallas presented him with his Purple Heart stating, \"on behalf of all the soldiers who were wounded and never knew who saved their lives, I'd like you to have this . . . I'd like to think you are the man who saved my life.\" Such stories of friendship and heroism are not the norm in our everyday lives but this story serves as a testimony to the fact that we make differences every day. We may feel that we are just doing our job, but to the person who is the recipient of our gesture or effort, we may be a hero.",

Few of us would discount the importance of heroes. But in the past few years we have rediscovered the importance of them as living examples of desirable character traits that we would like to see reflected in our society: traits like honesty, civility, courage, perseverance, loyalty, self-restraint, compassion, tolerance, fairness, and responsibility for the common good over and above individual advantage.",

The purpose of his study was to compare and contrast individuals' definitions of heroes across generational lines for notable trends in patterns. Forty males and 40 females who ranged in age from 10 to 90 were divided into 4 life-span phases based on their ages (phase 1, \u03fd20 y; phase 2, 21-40 y; phase 3, 41-60 y; phase 4, 61-90 y). Each subject was asked to define the term \"hero/heroine,\" and to name any personal heroes and why they were chosen. Eighty percent of the subjects in phases 1 and 2 confined their heroes to media personalities and sports figures. They viewed their heroes in terms of fame and fortune (the outcome), not on an accomplishment that was to be admired or emulated. In fact, among school-aged subjects, many recalled reading or learning about historically famous individuals but they did not make the connection between \"traditional\" heroes and their personal lives. As one student said, \"Yeah, I read about a lot of people in my history class. You know, like the people who made the country great and stuff like that. I've forgotten who most of them are, but it's just as well. I mean, why should I remember or admire some guy who's been dead a hundred years? They don't mean a thing to me.\"",

As they aged, these subjects noted that their heroes had to possess something more than \"imagery.\" \"Humanitarian factors\" were consistently important in their definitions. They tended to describe their choices as \"traditional\" he-roes. Sanchez noted that our changing culture has produced a \"nontraditional\" kind of role model, that heroes reflect the culture, and what the culture values will determine the type of heroic act that is to be rewarded. He concluded by stating that \"Heroes symbolize something greater than attaining wealth and fame, performing death-defying acts, or being comfortably shrouded in media-promoted status. They reflect our values, ideals, dreams, and making the right difference. Their qualities endure as the guide and inspiration for all of us to be heroes.\"",

They come from the literature where those born with every disadvantage believe that they are meant to be heroes and fulfill their destinies. They come in the form of children, and as recently as on December 26th in Phuket. There, Tilly Smith, a 10-year-old British schoolgirl, saved her family and 100 people staying at her hotel because she remembered the warning signs of a potential tsunami from a geography class. They come in the form of those serving in the National Guard or Reserves, like the Association for Surgical Education's (ASE) own P. J. Schenarts, who was awarded the Bronze Star for distinguishing himself by heroic and meritorious achievement. They come in the form of statesmen and presidents. When Harry Truman died, Mary McGrory of the Washington Star wrote \"he was not a hero or a magician or a chess player, or an obsession. He was a certifiable member of the human race, direct, fallible and unexpectedly wise when it counted [2] .\" David McCullough wrote, \"ambitious by nature, Truman was never torn by ambition, never tried to appear as something he was not. He stood for common sense, common decency. He spoke the common tongue. He held to the old guidelines, work hard, do your best, speak the truth, assume no airs, trust in God, have no fear [3] .\"",

The warning signs were there, we just didn't pay attention. We forgot about the simple acts of embracing our roles as heroes to our students. According to Lane Gerber [4] , author of \"Married to Their Careers,\" medical students may not care for or wish to emulate many of their teachers; at the same time they are under great pressure to perform and conform. The stressors today's students face are probably only slightly different that what you faced in your training: interpersonal conflicts with faculty and fellow students, fear of increasing responsibilities and the potential consequences of bad decisions, death of patients, dealing with chronic or terminally ill patients, fear of infections such as AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome], discomfort in discussing personal and sexual issues, discomfort in performing physical exams, and loneliness and loss of frequent contact with friends on other rotations. However, these factors can add up to a fellowship of suffering. This is important in understanding of how a professional identity gets formed. A student may not like the residents or faculty with whom he works, but because they have shared common experiences and because those individuals are already \"members of the club,\" they can exert significant influence on a student who is forming his personal and professional identity.",

We found that career choices for students interested in surgery originated primarily from pre-medical school experiences and interactions with surgeons. In contrast, students not interested in surgery made career choices during medical school and those choices were primarily made through exposure to their second-year preceptors. Students interested in surgery felt that their happiness was dependent on the congruence of career and personal satisfaction. Students not interested in surgery tended to separate happiness derived from career versus happiness derived family. Negative perceptions toward surgery were developed and reinforced by media, preceptors, and classmates. All students had minimal exposure to surgeons during their preclinical years and generally agreed that increased involvement with surgeons would be beneficial, particularly through preclinical experience.",

Students want information, and they want early interaction with, and exposure to, surgeons. They want role models.

Thinking out loud is teaching, it's acknowledging the fact that you know that students don't know what is going on. Ask them about what they think they're seeing. Ask them why they think something is occurring. And you know what? Students will walk away feeling you have taught them and feeling that they have learned something. Finish your sentences.

Sharon Salzberg [9] , author of \"Faith: Trusting Your Own Deepest Experience,\" told a story about her yoga instructor, who, in demonstrating a pose, lost his balance. When he asked her classmates what had just happened to him, all tried to provide justification for what he had just done. When he asked her, \"what just happened?\" She stated, \"to be honest, I think you fell.\" \"You're right,\" he replied, \"I fell. Then I started over. That's good yoga.\" The author stated that the incident was one of his best lessons, it was about honoring the role of intention. If we fall, we don't need self-recrimination or blame or anger, we need a reawakening of our intention and a willingness to recommit, to be whole-hearted once again. I think that we have fallen in surgery. Many surgeons in academic surgery have stopped reaching out because they are frustrated by the demands of clinical activities and the regulations that encumber their practices. They are withdrawing from, and in some cases lashing out at, the very things they cite that they love most about being in academics: teaching medical students and residents.",

Instead, I urge each of you to take a moment and reminisce through your personal hall of honor and remember what qualities these individuals possessed. I am grateful to my heroes. Some are new, some are unexpected, many have long held that special role in my life, and all are greatly appreciated. My heroes exist in this room. They are colleagues who have become among my dearest friends, they are the students and residents whose lives I have been privileged to be a part of, and they are the voices of my family and friends who have made me believe that I am limited only by my desire and my imagination.",
