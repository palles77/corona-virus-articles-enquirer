The extent to which health care workers and institutions use these CDC recommended practices is uncertain. Methods: The study examined health care worker adherence to CDC recommended respiratory infection control practices in primary care clinics and emergency departments of 5 medical centers in King County, Washington, using a self-administered questionnaire. All clinical, allied, and administrative health care workers in study settings were invited to participate: 653 (53%) responded, and 630 were included. Results: The survey revealed important shortcomings in overall personal and institutional use of CDC recommended practices, including deficiencies in posted alerts, patient masking and separation, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, staff training, and written procedures. Use of recommended measures was generally higher among nursing staff than medical practitioners. Conclusion: This study found significant gaps in adherence to CDC recommendations for the control of respiratory infections in ambulatory care clinical settings. Practical strategies are needed to identify and reduce barriers to implementation of recommended practices for control of respiratory infections. (Am J Infect Control 2008;36:268-75.) ",

Patients with respiratory illness congregate with other patients and companions in waiting and clinical care areas, which are often more crowded than usual during outbreaks of acute respiratory illness. The chance of disease transmission increases when a potentially contagious respiratory illness is not recognized, as might occur with the first cases of a new outbreak, or when infection control measures focusing on early recognition and corresponding measures are not consistently utilized. 3, 4 The prospects are particularly worrisome for highly transmissible and severe infections, such as pandemic influenza.",

The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic highlighted this risk. Of the 8096 probable cases of SARS observed worldwide, 20% involved HCWs. 5 SARS transmission was observed among workers who first encountered patients with symptoms of respiratory infection in ambulatory health care settings. 1, 3, 4 In some settings, the risk was at least as high for workers in reception and other nonclinical support roles as for workers directly involved in clinical care. 6 Occupationally acquired respiratory infections pose more than a personal risk. Infected workers can transmit infections to patients and companions, including in some cases before the worker develops symptoms or continues to work while sick. 1, [7] [8] [9] Prompted by the SARS experience and concern about the possibility of an influenza pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2004 developed new guidelines for HCW and institutional practices to prevent the transmission of respiratory infections, including but not limited to SARS, at the first point of contact with an undiagnosed, symptomatic person. 10 These guidelines include recommendations for visual alerts in waiting areas, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette procedures for patients including masking and separation of persons with respiratory symptoms, and utilization of standard and droplet infection control precautions by HCWs. 11 The extent to which these recommendations are implemented in practice is not established. Studies of hand hygiene and precautions against bloodborne pathogens in health care settings have consistently found under utilization of recommended practices. [12] [13] [14] [15] In general, the ability or willingness of workers to use safety measures is influenced by a variety of factors including workload, resource availability, and other barriers; adequacy of knowledge and necessary skills; organizational norms and safety climate; and individual practices, perceptions, and beliefs. 14-16 An important step toward designing effective measures to promote infection control practices is to assess the extent to which the desired practices are used and to identify subgroups of workers who may benefit from targeted interventions to improve compliance. Therefore, the present study questioned HCWs in primary and emergency care settings about individual and institutional use of recommended CDC respiratory infection control practices.",

Completed surveys were returned in a stamped addressed envelope (n 5 653; 53%, overall). The percent response ranged from 39% to 76% at each institution. The Institutional Review Board of the medical center with the 39% response rate did not allow use of the incentive. Response rates for the remaining 4 medical centers ranged from 56% to 76%.

Lapses were observed across all HCW occupations, although nurses tended to be more compliant with recommended practices than workers in other occupations, and medical practitioners tended to be less compliant. The study institutions commonly lacked, or workers had no knowledge of, written infection control procedures for undiagnosed patients presenting with respiratory infection symptoms. It is especially concerning that HCWs commonly reported little or no recent training in respiratory infection control and personal protection practices, despite the current concern regarding a potential influenza pandemic. 20 Reception, administration, and allied professional staff who routinely interact with patients were particularly unfamiliar with recommendations that are relevant to their work situation, suggesting a need for greater inclusion of nonclinical workers in infection control efforts. The importance of such efforts was illustrated by the SARS epidemic, during which one study in Hong Kong found higher SARS attack rates for nonmedical support staff (2.7%) than for nurses (1.2%) and other medical staff (0.3%). 6 Infection control and personal protective measures for respiratory infections are intended to be used routinely. However, because of practical constraints such as limited funding; material resources; and space, job, and productivity demands, and human nature, significant challenges can prevent reliable implementation of recommended practices. Unfortunately, although gaps in recommended practices can be inconsequential during routine conditions, they can have severe impacts during an unanticipated outbreak of a highly communicable infection. By the time an emergent event is recognized, there may already be substantial spread of disease to HCWs and other patients. 21 The SARS outbreak in Canada provided a wake-up call regarding the importance of strict adherence to infection control measures and a high baseline level of preparedness for prevention of respiratory infections. The containment of this outbreak in Vancouver, in contrast to the experience in Toronto, has been related to appropriate and timely infection control efforts. 21 Percentage is based on the number of subjects who provided a measurable response to the question. Number of nonresponses (subjects who provided a does not apply, don't know, or blank response) is shown in square brackets. *P value based on x 2 test of homogeneity.",

The patient's role in preventing the spread of infection to others is further reinforced when health care providers give personal instructions beyond the institutional alerts. During the SARS epidemic, personal hygiene education was associated with reduced incidence of influenza and other common respiratory illnesses in the community. 22 In the present study, nurses were much more likely to instruct patients personally about how to prevent the spread of respiratory infections than were medical practitioners or other workers with patient contact in technical or administrative roles. In general, responses from all occupations were lower when asked about information actively conveyed by the worker, compared with information passively conveyed by the institution.",

Similarly, only approximately half of direct care providers reported placing ILI patients in a private examination room as recommended by the CDC. Patient separation was reported more commonly in ED than PC settings, which may reflect differences in physical layout and capacity of the facilities. However, although evidence suggests that spatial separation can reduce the spread of droplet-transmissible infections, 23 implementation in a crowded waiting room is challenging 24 and in most settings requires significant planning and financial resources to identify appropriate additional space.",

However, our data are contradicted by a random-dialed telephone survey of 2231 households in 11 emerging infections programs surveillance areas of the United States (February 2004). 27, 28 Eighteen percent of adults indicated that they had an illness they thought was flu in the preceding 6 months; of those, only 8% of adults who sought treatment said their health care provider asked them to wear a mask, although 82% said they would do so if requested. 28 The differences in the results of these 2 studies may reflect differing methodologies used to collect data: selfadministered questionnaires may overreport effort, and telephone surveys may underreport effort because of limitations of recall. These findings, plus those of the present study, indicate a need to enhance efforts to provide masks for coughing patients at clinic entrances, with particular attention toward HCWs in occupations in which this may be less likely to be considered their responsibility.",

Most workers reported practicing hand hygiene before (90%) and after (95%) direct contact with a patient, but fewer did so immediately after touching items near a patient with ILI symptoms (59%) or checking a pulse or blood pressure (58%). Glove use with ILI patients was inconsistent (54%), particularly among medical practitioners (28%). This may reflect a perception that the risks are low through touching intact skin or objects, even though there is a strong theoretic rationale for the recommendation. 17 Eye protection was rarely used (21%). However, except for patients with suspected SARS or avian influenza, this recommendation is unresolved. 19 The present study had several limitations. The overall participation rate of 53% may have biased sample selection toward workers who participated because of knowledge of, or interest in, infection control. If so, the true use of respiratory infection control practices may be even lower than observed. Regardless, it is reassuring that the overall participation rate in the present study is comparable with that achieved in similar, previous studies, 14, 15, 33 suggesting that the present study can reasonably be compared with existing literature. All HCW occupations were similarly represented with estimated percent response by job category ranging from 44% to 57%. The generalizability of study findings is also potentially limited by the study's reliance on reported practices, rather than observations or other independent confirmation. Many previous, broadly based studies of HCW practices, however, have relied on similar study designs and self-reported knowledge, beliefs, or behaviors. 14, 15, 33, 34 Nevertheless, studies comparing observed versus self-report hand hygiene practices have demonstrated inaccuracies in self-reporting. [35] [36] [37] Bias may have been introduced by a tendency to report desirable practices. Responses might also have differed if the survey had been conducted during the winter influenza season with heightened awareness of respiratory infection control needs, rather than during summer and fall. On the other hand, the chosen study approach is appropriate for describing practices during routine circumstances rather than in response to a seasonal outbreak. Finally, the study was restricted to 5 independent medical centers in a metropolitan area, possibly limiting generalization of findings to other populations or settings. Despite the acknowledged limitations of this study, we believe our findings of HCW and institutional practices in primary and emergency care settings are likely to reflect practices in other facilities and communities in the United States.",

Responses of Does Not Apply or Don't Know were treated as missing values but are shown in the Tables; response percentages were based on the number of subjects who provided a measurable response. Demographic questions were based on previously used questionnaires, 14,15 when possible, or were developed by the investigators.
