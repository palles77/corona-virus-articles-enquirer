Study design: Prospective observational study of all patients who were admitted to six hospitals in Edmonton, AL, Canada, with a diagnosis of CAP from November 15, 2000, to November 14, 2002. Pneumonia was defined as two or more respiratory symptoms and signs and an opacity on a chest radiograph as interpreted by the attending physician. Results: A total of 3,043 patients were enrolled in the study, 246 of whom died (8.1%). On multivariate analysis, increasing pneumonia severity score, increasing age, site of care, consultation with a respirologist or infectious diseases physician, and functional status at the time of admission were all independently predictive of mortality. Increasing pneumonia severity risk score, increasing age, site of hospitalization, functional status, and consultation with an infectious diseases physician or a respirologist were independently associated with both early (< 5 days) and late (> 5 days) mortality. In contrast, partial or complete use of the pneumonia pathway was associated with decreased early mortality, but had no effect on late mortality. A low lymphocyte count and a high serum potassium level were associated with early but not with late mortality. The type of antibiotic therapy had an effect on late but not on early mortality. Conclusions: Functional status at the time of hospital admission is a powerful predictor of mortality and should be incorporated into any scores or models that are used to predict mortality. While there are some common predictors of early and late in-hospital mortality, early mortality is not affected by the timing or type of antibiotic therapy, whereas late mortality is influenced by the type of antibiotic therapy. Hyperkalemia and lymphopenia are associated with early mortality.",

However, in administrative database studies, where large populations are available, the mortality rate ranges from 9.7 to 11%. 3, 4 In the past few years, attention has been paid to processes of care and the impact of these on the outcome of pneumonia. Critical pathways are disease-specific management strategies that define the essential steps of a complex care process. 5 Such pathways were introduced to try to reduce variations in care. We introduced a pneumonia pathway at all six hospitals that provide care for adults in the greater Edmonton area. The objective of this study was to determine the factors that influence inhospital mortality for patients with CAP and whether adherence to the pathway had an effect on mortality.",

Reminders to medical staff regarding assessment of vaccination status for pneumococcal and influenza vaccines were provided, and a recommendation for administration of these vaccines, if indicated, was included in the order sheet. In addition, counseling and literature regarding cessation of smoking were made available to those who were tobacco smokers. A three-part discharge algorithm was part of the pathway.

Univariate analysis was used to exclude predictors that lacked marginal relationship with the all-cause mortality.

Both c-statistic and the Hosmer and Lemeshow lack of fit test were used to evaluate the adequacy of the logistic regression models. Hierarchical logistic regression models with predictors added one at a time were also examined to evaluate the possible collinearity among the predictors. No significant collinearity among the factors was observed. Since the comorbidity and medical history of the patients were accounted for during the calculation of the pneumonia severity index, no further adjustment was made.

The factors selected for the calculation of the propensity score included site, age, nursing home residence, residence with home care, gender, substance abuse, study year, season at the time of presentation, and median household income. The above variables and their interactions (up to five ways) were evaluated for their associations with CAP pathway used. Site, residence with home care, and their interaction were selected to calculate the estimated propensity score for the pathway use. The estimated propensity score of the CAP pathway was incorporated into the analysis of mortality as a covariate in the model. In addition to the estimated propensity score for the use of CAP pathway, the interaction between site and CAP pathway was also evaluated in the multivariate logistic regression model of mortality.

A low lymphocyte count and a high potassium level were associated with early, but not with late mortality. The type of antibiotic therapy had an effect on late but not on early mortality.

            "text": "It is evident that there are many factors that contribute to mortality among patients who require hospitalization for treatment of CAP. These can be grouped as patient factors, processes of care factors, physician factors, and other factors. Fine and co- workers 8 derived a pneumonia severity of illness score based on 20 items that included demographic factors, comorbidity, physical examination findings, and laboratory and radiographic data. Scores ranged from 0 (no points are given for patients \u0545 50 years of age without comorbidity and no physiologic abnormalities) to 250, with higher scores indicating more severe pneumonia. In the original study, patients were grouped into five risk classes for mortality; classes I to III (\u0545 90 points) are at low risk for death, while the mortality rate in class IV was 9%, and 27% in class V. Since the mortality for patients in the risk classes I and II in our study was very low and insufficient for estimation, the pneumonia severity was analyzed as a continuous score. Even though age is the major driver in the Fine risk score (one point is given for each year of age for male subjects and 10 points are subtracted from the total age points for female subjects), we found that increasing age still contributed to the risk of mortality over and above that which was accounted for in the severity score. Thus, we carried out additional adjustment for age in the final logistic regression model due to the residual confounding. An additional independent association between age and mortality was observed in both multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. The pneumonia severity score does not consider other factors that might be important in mortality, namely functional status, site of care, and processes of care. Ethnicity is also an important factor influencing mortality due to pneumonia. Haas et al 15 found that Hispanics and Asian Americans had a lower risk of death from CAP than whites in California. In one study, African-American men admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals in the United States had lower risk-adjusted mortality for a variety of conditions, including pneumonia. 16 Most of the population of Alberta is white. One hundred thirteen of our patients (3.7%) were Aboriginal Canadians. In an administrative database study of all persons admitted to hospital with pneumonia in Alberta over a 5-year period, patients of Aboriginal treaty status constituted 7% of the 43,642 comprising the study population. 17 In that study, Aboriginal status was not associated with increased mortality. In the current study, the mortality rate among those of Aboriginal descent was very low at 0.8%. However, these patients were considerably younger than the remainder of the pneumonia population and were more likely to be in risk classes I to III. A major finding in this study was the contribution of functional status at the time of hospital admission as an independent predictor of mortality. Thus, patients who were in wheelchair or bedridden were 1.4 times and 4 times, respectively, more likely to die compared to patients who walked without problems. Two hundred nineteen persons (7.1%) were using wheelchairs, and 103 persons (3.3%) were bedridden. In a case-control study of 101 patients \u0546 65 years of age with pneumonia, Riquelme et al 18 reported a crude mortality rate of 26%. Bedridden state had a relative risk of 10.75 for mortality. 19 In a study of patients with COPD, Oga et al 20 noted that exercise capacity and health status were significantly predictive of mortality independent of age or airflow limitation. Davis and co-workers 21 studied persons admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital between 1987 and 1992 for cerebrovascular disease or pneumonia. They found that functional status had as much predictive value for in-hospital mortality as laboratory data. Indeed, the requirement for total assistance with bathing was the best single predictor of in-hospital mortality.",

            "text": "Treatment with levofloxacin only was associated with a major reduction in mortality. Since this was not a randomized clinical trial, it is difficult to conclude that this effect was solely due to the antibiotic. The pathway encouraged levofloxacin use, and the fact that patients treated with levofloxacin only had low mortality could also indicate that physicians seldom change therapy in patients who are responding to treatment; indeed, this is confounding by indication. It also indicates that protocolized care with antibiotics consistent with guidelines 7 leads to lower mortality. Furthermore this observation does not demonstrate the superiority of a quinolone over a cephalosporin/macrolide combination. It is noteworthy, however, that we did not find that administration of antibiotic therapy \u03fe 8 h after presentation to the emergency department was associated with increased mortality, as has been described by others. 22, 23 Recently, Silber et al 24 were also unable to show an association between time from arrival at the emergency department to antibiotic therapy, and time to achievement of stability or mortality in patients with CAP. In an illness that typically begins days before the patient presents to the hospital, it seems unusual that a delay of administration of antibiotic therapy of a few hours would be associated with an increased mortality rate. In the absence of data from randomized controlled trials, it is difficult to be sure that this is a real finding, even though as a standard of care timely administration of antibiotic therapy is appropriate. It is important to note that our study and that of Silber et al 24 differed from the two studies 22,23 that found an increased mortality rate if time from arrival to the emergency department to the first dose of antibiotics was prolonged, in that both of these studies dealt with Medicare patients who by definition were all \u03fe 65 years of age. It is also noteworthy that Houck et al 23 could not demonstrate such an effect for those who had received antibiotic therapy prior to presentation. Treatment at hospital C was an independent risk factor for increased mortality in the overall, early, and late mortality models after the adjustment of other factors. Hospital factors such as teaching status, type of ownership, and location have been associated with differences in mortality for a variety of conditions. 25, 26 Understaffing of hospitals with nurses has also been associated with increased mortality. 27 In our study, the hospital with a higher mortality rate is one of the three hospitals in Edmonton that does not have medicine house staff. In conjunction with the other hospitals, it is part of a regional health authority under one administration. We did not monitor nurse-staffing patterns as part of our study. Greater physician experience with pneumonia, as indicated by the number of patients treated in hospital with this illness per year, is reflected in a lower mortality rate. 17 Thus, there are at least two factors that may have been different at the hospital with the higher mortality. At the end of the first year of the study, when we noted the higher mortality rate at hospital C, we reviewed all the deaths from pneumonia and noted only one preventable death.",

            "text": "One of the most interesting findings in our study is that the risk factors for early and late mortality differed substantially. The type of antibiotic therapy affected only late mortality. Austrian and Gold, 28 in a large study of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in the early 1960s, noted that treatment with penicillin had no effect on mortality for the first 4 days of the illness. Mortensen et al 29 carefully determined the causes of death of the 208 patients (9%) who died within 90 days of enrollment in their study of CAP. Fifty-three percent of the deaths were pneumonia related. Factors predictive of pneumoniarelated mortality included hypothermia, altered mental state, increased serum urea nitrogen levels, chronic liver disease, leukopenia, and hypoxemia. Factors predictive of pneumonia-unrelated mortality included dementia, immunosuppressive conditions, active cancer, systolic hypotension, male gender, and multilobar pulmonary infiltrates. Increased age and evidence of aspiration were predictive of both pneumonia-related and -unrelated mortality. In a study of 157 patients with severe ARDS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), 98% had lymphopenia (\u03fd 1 \u03eb 10 9 /L). 28 Lymphopenia in severe acute respiratory syndrome patients peaked during week 2. We recorded only the lymphocyte count at the time of hospital admission. In our study, 67% of those who died within 5 days of hospital admission were lymphopenic at hospital admission vs 29% of the survivors. For those who died \u03fe 5 days after hospital admission, 53.4% were lymphopenic vs 43.8% for the survivors. Clearly, the role of the lymphocyte in pneumonia-related mortality requires further investigation. It should be noted that HIV status did not play a role in lymphopenia predicting mortality. Only 25 HIV-positive patients were in the study, and none died in hospital. Lymphopenia is also a marker for malnutrition. In one study, malnutrition was associated with higher mortality among men (but not women) with pneumonia. 31 Hyperkalemia was an independent predictor of early mortality in our study. In a study of 463 patients with CAP from Chile, 8% of whom died in hospital, hyperkalemia was one of 25 factors associated with mortality. 32 Since a number of our patients had acute renal failure, it is likely that this played a role in the hyperkalemia.",

            "text": "Our study has several strengths. It was prospective, and all patients with a diagnosis of CAP were enrolled. The limitations to our study include the fact that our case definition allowed nonradiologists to diagnose pneumonia on chest radiography. Approximately 25% of the patients had their chest radiographs read as \"no pneumonia\" by a radiologist. However interobserver and intraobserver variability in the interpretation of chest radiographs of patients with possible pneumonia by radiologists is well known. 33 Air bronchograms, atelectasis, and COPD are usually not recognized by nonradiologists. 33 Some patients with radiographs read by radiologists as no pneumonia will in fact have pneumonia. In a study 34 in which simultaneously obtained high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans of the chest and chest radiographs were compared in 47 patients presenting with presumed CAP, HRCT identified all 18 cases that were apparent on chest radiography and an additional 8 cases. Thus, 8 of the 26 of the pneumonias (31%) in this study were not identified by chest radiography. 33 In a somewhat similar study 35 performed on 54 hospitalized patients, additional information provided by HRCT resulted in a change in treatment plan in 39% of patients.",

We have also shown that some of the factors associated with early mortality differ from those associated with late mortality.",
