            "text": "The histologic pattern of AFOP is similar to that of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), cryptic organic pneumonia (COP), and eosinophilic pneumonia [4] ; however, it has its own distinct histopathology. The course of AFOP can be acute or subacute, and clinical outcomes are directly related to the mode of onset. Patients with acute and severe AFOP show a clinical course similar to that of patients with DAD and typically have a poor prognosis. [1] Patients with subacute onset exhibited similarity to COP with respect to clinical manifestations, imaging findings, treatment efficacy, and prognosis. [5] Hwang et al [6] and Cincotta et al [7] proposed that traditional DAD may be an early manifestation of acute lung injury, while AFOP represents its late manifestation. They believe that AFOP is not an independent disease entity but rather a variant of DAD. AFOP was classified as a rare histologic pattern of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society in 2013. [8] The AFOP has a large age range, ranging from 38 days to 78 years of age. The main clinical manifestations are cough, respiratory distress, asthma-like symptoms, and chest tightness. The most common radiologic findings are diffuse, patchy opacities with both peripheral and bilateral distribution; the lesions may be limited to the lung bases. [1] CT images may show solitary nodule with air bronchograms which may progress to diffuse lung opacities. [9] In addition, the images may appear similar to those in other lung diseases such as interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and infectious pneumonia. [10] A definitive diagnosis of AFOP requires histopathologic evaluation. Tissue histopathology is characterized by intraalveolar fibrin in the form of fibrin \"balls\" and organizing pneumonia with a patchy distribution. [11] Specimens for histologic diagnosis of AFOP can be obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy, PNLB, thoracoscopic lung biopsy, or open lung biopsy. Although large biopsy specimens are recommended, we suggest that the method of lung biopsy should be consistent with the actual clinical situation, including the patient's tolerance to specific operations and the location of lung lesions.",

[1] Infectious diseases should be excluded prior to the administration of corticosteroids. AFOP was mistakenly diagnosed in a patient with tuberculosis and the inherent tuberculosis finally progressed to severe bilateral diffuse military tuberculosis owing to the use of steroids. [15] In addition, the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is also likely based on the clinical characteristics (exanthema over right calf and the effect of hormone therapy) despite the lack of skin biopsy. A literature review [16] suggested an association between Sweet syndrome and NTMIs; therefore, the possibility of NTMIs cannot be completely ruled out.",
