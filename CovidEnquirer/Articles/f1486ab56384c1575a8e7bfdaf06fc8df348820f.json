            "text": "Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging viral infectious disease. We report our experience in treating SARS patients. Methods: From April 27 to May 24, 2003, a total of 36 patients with probable SARS were admitted and treated in a hospital rearranged as a special center for the management of SARS patients. Medical records for the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with respiratory failure and intubation. Results: Of the 36 patients with probable SARS (median age, 37 years; range, 22-66 years), 9 were male and 27 were female. Thirty-two patients (88.9%) were infected in the hospital setting. All patients presented with fever, and 33 eventually developed lymphopenia during hospitalization. Chest radiography showed no unique pattern, but pleural effusion was not seen. All patients initially received empiric antibacterial therapy against common causative pathogens of atypical pneumonia. Ribavirin was given to all except 1 patient. Twenty-two patients received immunoglobulin therapy, and 32 were given corticosteroids. A total of 20 patients (55.6%) required supplemental oxygen, and 8 (22.2%) were intubated with mechanical ventilatory support. Two of these patients died. A higher body temperature at presentation (median 39.5 vs 38.6\u00baC), and higher peak values of lactate dehydrogenase (410 vs 282 U/L) and C-reactive protein (10.2 vs 2.5 mg/dL), were associated with subsequent respiratory failure. Multivariate analysis showed that peak level of C-reactive protein was the only independent predictor of respiratory failure and intubation (odds ratio for every increment of 1 mg/dL = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.003, 2.097; p = 0.048). Conclusion: All patients with probable SARS who were admitted to hospital presented with fever and lymphopenia. While the efficacy of different treatments could not be evaluated from this retrospective study, a higher value of C-reactive protein was associated with the development of respiratory failure and subsequent intubation.

Sputum and blood samples from all patients were sent for bacterial culture. Samples for SARS-virus assays (including nasopharyngeal swabs, serum and urine samples), and for serologic testing for the common pathogens of atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Legionella spp.), were taken and sent to laboratories of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control, after which cases were reported to the sanitary authorities in Taiwan.

Nine patients were male and 27 female, with ages ranging from 20-66 years (median, 37 years). Thirty-two patients (88.9%) were health care global alert about outbreak of the illness, which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). At this time, there were known SARS cases in China (both the mainland and the special administrative region of Hong Kong), Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. By May 31, 2003, a cumulative total of 8,360 cases of SARS, with 764 deaths, had been reported by 30 countries. 2 The first probable case of SARS reported in Taiwan was that of a 54-year-old businessman who traveled to Guangdong Province and returned to Taipei, via Hong Kong, on February 21, 2003. 3 From the beginning of March, Taiwan experienced a gradual increase in the number of probable cases of SARS. Initially, most reported cases were either imported or secondary. 3 However, the number increased markedly at the end of April, when local transmission in hospitals became the source of most new infections. Up to June 27, 2003 , there was a cumulative total of 681 probable SARS cases in Taiwan, with 84 deaths. However, few articles were written describing the clinical characteristics and management of SARS patients in Taiwan. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] This study delineates clinical features, laboratory data, chest radiography, management and outcomes for patients with probable SARS at a SARS center in Taipei, and determines factors associated with respiratory failure and subsequent intubation in such patients.",

[10] [11] [12] [13] Approximately 1-half to 2-thirds of the patients presented with moderate lymphopenia (63.9%), mild thrombocytopenia (47.2%), and an elevated LDH level (66.7%), on admission. Interestingly, all but 3 patients developed lymphopenia during hospitalization, and in most cases, this occurred during the second week of the disease. This finding is consistent with that found by Wong et al, who proposed that lymphocyte depletion might result from a direct effect of the virus, or various cytokines, on lymphocytes. 14 Panesar suggested that lymphocyte margination due to glucocorticosteroid therapy or stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis might be another explanation for lymphopenia, 15 while O'Donnell et al pointed out that apoptosis might also play a role. 16 The chest radiograph presentations in our study are also compatible with findings in previous studies. 11, 12, 17 In the early disease stages, a peripheral/pleural-based opacity may be the only abnormality. This may range from a ground-glass appearance to consolidation. Unilateral (50%) infiltration is more common than bilateral or multifocal infiltration in the initial presentation, whereas cavitation and pleural effusion are not features of this disease. The radiographic involve- ment usually progresses to bilateral infiltration, including a pattern compatible with adult RDS. 4, 5, [18] [19] [20] Our univariate analysis showed that initial, multifocal, radiographic involvement was not associated with the development of respiratory failure (p = 0.346). Peiris et al also showed that neither apparently normal nor multilobar involvement on chest radiograph at admission was associated with the development of adult RDS. 13 In the current, retrospective study of a small number of patients, the efficacy of different treatments could not be elucidated. IVIG has been used in combination therapy for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia and cytomegalovirus pneumonia in bone marrow transplant recipients, and for treating RSV pneumonia in selected infants and children. [21] [22] [23] [24] IVIG has also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of other viral pneumonias. [25] [26] [27] Nevertheless, our preliminary results showed that, in SARS patients, the development of respiratory failure was not associated with less frequent or delayed use of IVIG.",

A study of community-acquired pneumonia showed that high interleukin-6 or CRP levels were associated with a long duration of fever and hospital stay, and less frequent clinical or radiographic recovery during follow-up after discharge. 30 Moreover, elevated serum levels of CRP on admission to the intensive care unit correlate with an increased risk of organ failure and death, and persistently high CRP levels correlate with a poor outcome in critically ill patients. 31 We suggest that CRP might reflect the severity of inflammation caused by the SARS virus and be related to immunopathologic damage to the lung, thus predicting a poor outcome.",
