            "text": "The present review comments on the role of the use of zeolites as feed additives on the prevention and/or the treatment of certain farm animal diseases. Both natural and synthetic zeolites have been used in animal nutrition mainly to improve performance traits and, based on their fundamental physicochemical properties, they were also tested and found to be efficacious in the prevention of ammonia and heavy metal toxicities, poisonings as well as radioactive elements uptake and metabolic skeletal defects. During the last decade, their utilization as mycotoxin-binding adsorbents has been a topic of considerable interest and many published research data indicate their potential efficacy against different types of mycotoxins either as a primary material or after specific modifications related to their surface properties. Ingested zeolites are involved in many biochemical processes through ion exchange, adsorption and catalysis. Recent findings support their role in the prevention of certain metabolic diseases in dairy cows, as well as their shifting effect on nitrogen excretion from urine to faeces in monogastric animals, which results in lower aerial ammonia concentration in the confinement facilities. Moreover, new evidence provide insights into potential mechanisms involved in zeolites supporting effect on animals suffered from gastrointestinal disturbances, including intestinal parasite infections. All the proposed mechanisms of zeolites\u00d5 effects are summarized in the present review and possible focus topics for further research in selected areas are suggested.",

Both natural and synthetic zeolites are porous materials, characterized by the ability to lose and gain water reversibly, to adsorb molecules of appropriate cross-sectional diameter (adsorption property, or acting as molecular sieves) and to exchange their constituent cations without major change of their structure (ion-exchange property) [1, 2] . The exploitation of these properties underlies the use of zeolites in a wide range of industrial and agricultural applications and particularly in animal nutrition since mid-1960s [3] .",

Zeolites also enhance the reproductive performance of sows [1, 20, 21] , increase the milk yield of dairy cows [22, 23] and the egg production of laying hens [24, 25] and have beneficial effects on egg weight and the interior egg characteristics [24] [25] [26] . However, the extent of performance enhancement effects is related to the type of the used zeolite, its purity and physicochemical properties, as well as to the supplementation level used in the diets. Besides, the particle size of the zeolitic material, crystallite size and the degree of aggregation, as well as the porosity of individual particles determine the access of ingesta fluids to the zeolitic surface during passage across gastrointestinal tract and strongly affect its ion exchange, adsorption and catalytic properties. Table 1 summarizes the possible mechanisms by which zeolites may exert their performance promoting properties in farm animals.",

One of the latest approaches to this global concern has been the use of nutritionally inert adsorbents in the diet that sequester mycotoxins, thus reducing intestinal absorption and, additionally, avoiding toxic effects for livestock and the carry-over of toxin compounds to animal products. For this purpose, phyllosilicates such as hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicates (HSCAS) and bentonite--which consist of layered crystalline structures and possess similar physicochemical properties with zeolites--have been first used successfully in poultry, pig, sheep, cattle and laboratory animals [33, 34, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .",

In general, adsorption process on binders is strongly related to charge distribution, pore dimensions and accessible surface area of the adsorbent, as well as to polarity, solubility and molecular dimensions of the certain mycotoxin which is to be adsorbed [46] . Molecular sizes of aflatoxins range from 5.18 \u00c5 (B 1 and B 2 ) to 6.50 \u00c5 (G 1 and G 2 ) and only zeolites with entry channels wide enough to permit the diffusion of aflatoxin molecules to the intracrystalline structure are capable of demonstrating a clear sequestering effect. Clinoptilolite, a natural zeolite, has high adsorption indexes in vitro, more than 80%, for aflatoxins B 1 [48, 49] and G 2 [48] and the adsorption process begins with a fast reaction whereby most of the toxin is adsorbed within the first few minutes [48] . On the contrary, Lemke et al. [50] conducted a variety of in vitro adsorption studies and reported a limited degree of clinoptilolite ability to bind aflatoxin B 1 effectively. According to them, adsorbent materials should be checked through a multi-tiered system of in vitro tests in order potential interactive factors, such as intestinal physicochemical variables and feed components, to be precluded. Indeed, a previous in vitro study had demonstrated average aflatoxin retention in natural zeolites of 60%, but also a nitrogen compound-related adsorbent effectiveness, when liquid media quality parameters had been taken into account [51] . The in vivo efficacy of zeolites to ameliorate the consequences of aflatoxicosis, mainly in poultry, has also been verified in many cases (Table 2 ).",

            "text": "As far as other mycotoxins are concerned, mineral adsorbents exert a lower efficacy against mycotoxins containing less polar functional groups, which are required for efficient chemisorption on hydrophilic negatively charged mineral surfaces to occur. This limitation can be overcome by the use of chemically modified clays. Modifications consist of alterations of Elimination of mycotoxin growth inhibitory effects [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] surface properties resulting in an increased hydrophobicity, by exchange of structural charge-balance cations with high molecular weight quaternary amines. In vitro results have verified the binding efficacy of modified montmorilonite and clinoptilolite against zearalenone and ochratoxin A [60, 61] . However, naturally occurring clays also exert a moderate binding efficacy against mycotoxins, other than aflatoxins, as evidenced for zearalenone and ochratoxin A by in vitro [57] and field trials [62, 63] , as well as for cyclopiazonic acid in experiments with broilers [45] . Remarkable conclusions related to zeolites\u00d5 efficacy against zearalenone toxicosis have also been drawn by in vivo studies. Feeding zearalenone to rats, Smith [64] demonstrated that the dietary use of a synthetic anion exchange zeolite could alter the faecal and urinary excretory patterns of zearalenone due to the elimination of its intestinal absorption. Recently, the dietary use of a clinoptilolite-rich tuff was also effective in decreasing zearalenone and a-zearalenole excretion in pigs fed diets contaminated with 500 ppb zearalenone [65] . Additionally, in a field-case of zearalenone toxicosis with mean concentrations of 660 ppb, Papaioannou et al. [20] reported that the supplementation of a clinoptilolite rich tuff at the rate of 2% in the ration of pregnant sows implied a rather protective role against the consequences of zearalenone ingestion, as evidenced by the improvement of indicative performance traits. Similar results were also obtained in swine with the dietary use of a modified clinoptilolite-healandite rich tuff at 0.2% and with zearalenone concentration exceeding 3.5 ppm [66] .",

The exact mechanism of zeolites\u00d5 effect is not quite clear so far, although there is evidence that the use of zeolites may eliminate various predisposing and/or causative factors which are associated in the culmination of intestinal disturbances in an interactive way. Apart from zeolites\u00d5 retarding effect on intestinal passage rate [1] and their water adsorption property, which leads to the appearance of drier and more compact faeces, as in the case of phillipsite [75] or clinoptilolite [76] , Vrzgula et al. [71] also proposed that the ameliorative effect on diarrhoea syndrome of calves might result from either the alteration of metabolic acidosis, through effects on osmotic pressure in the intestinal lumen, or the increased retention of the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. As far as we know, there is no evidence in the available literature for retention of enteropathogenic E. coli on the outer surface of zeolite particles. However, clinoptilolite and mordenite are capable to adsorb and partially inactivate the thermo-labile (LT) E. coli enterotoxin in vitro, thus constricting its attachment to the intestinal Laying hens Significant decrease in liver mycotoxin concentration and liver weight during aflatoxicosis caused by 2.5 mg kg \u00c01 diet [56] cell-membrane receptors [77] . Furthermore, the adsorption capacity of clinoptilolite and mordenite has been proved to be higher than 94% for virions of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus, although infectivity level of zeolite-virus complex seems to remain unchanged [78] .",

The results obtained were satisfactory as the administration of synthetic zeolite A, either as an oral drench or supplemented to the total mixed ration, during the dry period reduced the bioavailability of dietary Ca and efficiently protected against milk fever, by stimulating Ca-homeostatic mechanisms prior to parturition [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] .

The incidence of milk fever was significantly lower in cows that were receiving a concentrate supplemented with clinoptilolite at the level of 2.5% (5.9%) during the last month of the dry period and the onset of lactation compared to the animals in the control group (38.9%), which were not receiving clinoptilolite, whereas was not significantly different than those that were receiving 1.25% clinoptilolite (17.6%) with the concentrates at the same period. The authors suggested that clinoptilolite might have had similar effect with zeolite A in activating Ca homeostatic mechanisms prior to parturition. As a consequence, the animals receiving 2.5% clinoptilolite responded faster and more efficiently in the drop of serum Ca observed at the day of calving and did not show any clinical signs of milk fever the following days. However, the exact mechanism for this positive effect of clinoptilolite is currently unknown and should be further investigated.",

[113] , similar protection is provided in swine as well. The selectivity of clinoptilolite for cadmium (Cd) and Pb has been studied in vitro in order to be investigated whether its use reduces the levels of these elements in rumen and abomasal fluid. The experiments showed that clinoptilolite bent the 91% of Pb and the 99% of Cd in rumen fluid within 24 h, and in the abomasal fluid the 94% of Pb within less than 1 h [114] . The toxic effects of long-term ingestion of Cd (100 ppm CdCl 2 ) on female rats and their progeny were not diminished by the simultaneous feeding of a clinoptilolite-rich tuff at 5% in the diet [115] . Adversely, the efficacy of clinoptilolite against Cd toxicity has been proved in pigs by the same authors who observed that 3% clinoptilolite supplementation prevented the cadmium-induced iron deficient anemia in growing swine that were receiving 150 ppm CdCl 2 [116] . The results of these experiments suggest the feasibility of using zeolites and mainly clinoptilolite as a feed additive in the prevention of certain types of heavy metal intoxications in farm animals or in aquatic biological systems, as is the case in the study of Jain [117] , where is ascertained the capacity of zeolite to enhance the removal of Pb from water, thus decreasing its availability to the teleost fish Heteropneustes fossilis.",

Arnek and Forsberg [118] proved the selectivity of some natural zeolites such as clinoptilolite, chabazite and modernite for cesium and Gomonaj et al. [119] the selectivity of clinoptilolite for strodium and zirconium. Phillippo et al.

Furthermore, Forsberg et al. [121] observed that the administration of mordenite in sheep and goats increased the excretion of cesium with feces and reduced its accumulation in tissues. On the other hand, Rachubik and Kowalski [122] demonstrated that synthetic zeolite-enriched diets exerted an inconsistent pattern of radiostrontium assimilation in the bone tissue and liver or kidneys of rats intragastrically dosed with an aqueous solution of 90 SrCl 2 .",

[123] observed that the inclusion of bentonite, a phyllosilicate, in the ration of sheep at the rate of 0.5% significantly reduced the Cu concentration in liver and suggested the use of this material in order to prevent copper poisoning. In contrast, clinoptilolite does not seem to be effective, as Pond [124] found that the addition of 2% clinoptilolite to the basal diet of sheep containing 10 or 20 ppm Cu did not protect against the toxic signs of Cu and increased the mortality in lambs fed the diet with 20 ppm Cu. A lack of any effect on liver Cu accumulation was also found in growing pigs which were on diets supplemented with 0.5% synthetic zeolite A and 250 ppm Cu [125] . Clinoptilolite was expected to exchange Cu in the lumen of the intestine, thereby decreasing the toxicity of excess Cu for sheep, whose tolerance for Cu is low compared with that of other food animals. However, such action was not observed probably due to a shift in ion-exchange relative to Cu and NH \u00fe 4 or to some other complex interaction, which resulted in a net increase in Cu available for absorption from the intestinal tract [124] . The optimum ratio of clinoptilolite to Cu in the diet for reducing the intestinal absorption of the latter has not been determined, but such information, according to Pond [126] , is needed in order to establish appropriate levels of dietary clinoptilolite supplementation.",

According to Wells and McHugh [127] , the administration of clinoptilolite at the rate of 10% of a conventional diet facilitated the removal of parasites from the intestinal lumen of rats infected with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Furthermore, Wells and Kilduff [128] observed a more accelerated intestinal a-D-glucosidase and aminopeptidase activity restitution in rats fed a commercial diet supplemented with clinoptilolite (5%) and recovering from N. brasiliensis infection. Confirming the observations in rats, Deligiannis et al. [129] recently proved the efficacy of clinoptilolite against parasite infections in growing lambs. They showed that feeding lambs, primarily infected with a single dose of gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes, with a concentrate mixture containing 3% clinoptilolite significantly decreased their total worm burden and faecal egg counts per capita fecundity and demonstrated that clinoptilolite supplementation reduced the establishment of GI nematodes and resulted in a good performance of the animals.",

Promising results were obtained, at first, as regards tetramisoleloaded synthetic zeolite Y [130] and recently, pyranteland fenbendazole-loaded synthetic zeolite Y in rats infested with N. brasiliensis and dichlorvos-loaded zeolite Y in pigs infected with Ascaris suum [131] . In the case of tetramisole and dichlorvos, anthelmintic molecules are small enough to fit through the entry channels of zeolite Y (windows of 7.4 \u00c5 ), while fenbendazole loading requires an initial partial dealumination of the zeolitic carrier and large pyrantel molecules allow only outer surface loading to occur.",

Accordingly, the incorporation of zeolite A in the same diets at 1% exerts a clear beneficial effect in reducing the incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia [132] [133] [134] . Although tibial dyschondroplasia is a metabolic cartilage disease which represents the endpoint of several mechanisms, the incidence is increased when high dietary levels of phosphorus are used [135] or when dietary calcium is lower than 0.85% [136] . Similarly, the beneficial effect of zeolite A is inconsistent and largely depends on the dietary level of calcium. According to Watkins and Southern [137] , the dietary use of 0.75% zeolite A in broilers is accompanied by alterations in mineral absorption and tissue distribution, resulting in increased tibia ash and density and improved fresh tibia shearing force scoring, but only when dietary calcium ranges from 0.6% to 0.8%. In the same direction, the reduction in the incidence and severity of dyschondroplastic lesions in the research of Edwards [134] in broilers was associated with a zeolite-induced decrease in calcium, total phosphorus and, in particular, phytate phosphorus retention.",

The simultaneous presence of clinoptilolite-heulandite enriched zeolite and antimicrobials in Vibrio cholerae serotype 01 cultivations did not ameliorate the total inhibition of bacteria growth. Adversely, in vitro studies conducted by the same authors indicated that the zeolitic material slightly adsorbs theophyline, propanolole and phenobarbital. Interestingly, Lam et al. [139] demonstrated, through quantum mechanical calculations, the possibility of the adsorption of metronidazole on clinoptilolite and suggested that the principal interaction stands at the formation of hydrogen bonds and coulombic forces among groups of the metronidazole molecule and the external surface of the zeolitic matrix. However, in experiments which were carried out in aqueous medium simulating pH and temperature conditions of human gastrointestinal tract, the adsorptive behaviour was basically related to the zeolite\u00d5s level of purification, as in the case of metronidazole, and moreover to the polarity of the molecules, since no interference with sulfamethazole was confirmed [140] . Both antimicrobials have molecule dimensions which are too large to enter the channels of the natural clinoptilolite used in these experiments, implying that potential interactions concern the outer surface of the zeolite, including the mesoporosity. However, the amphoteric character shown by natural zeolites as a consequence of their bufferant behaviour in an aqueous solution, suggests that they could attenuate the side effects derived from gastrointestinal sharp pH changes, favouring the absorption of some simultaneously administered drugs.",

Given the high ammonium and ammonia adsorption capacities of the zeolites, some researchers focused their studies at the evaluation of the effect of the dietary use of zeolites on environmental stressors, such as aerial ammonia, recognized to contribute to persistent health problems under intensive rearing conditions. Ma et al. [144] reported that the incorporation of a zeolitic-tuff in the basal diet of finishing pigs at the inclusion rate of 5% had a favorable deodorizing effect and resulted in a lower aerial ammonia concentration by 28.5%. Furthermore, studies in growing pigs by Barrington and El Moueddeb [145] established the effectiveness of the same dietary scheme in reducing nitrogen volatilization and ammonia emission by 21%, while Saoulidis et al. [146] demonstrated that the dietary use of a clinoptilolite-rich tuff at the supplementation rate of 2% was accompanied by a reduction of 27.1% and 21.3% in aerial ammonia level of growing and finishing pig facilities, respectively. According to them, a possible mode of action by which zeolites exert their beneficial effect on aerial ammonia level, could be the shifting of the nitrogen excretion from urine to faeces and the consequent reduction of urea excretion, the main organic source of ammonia. Previous published data [105] are also confirmatory to this hypothesis.",

In the case of mycotoxicoses, their applicability as binders against polar toxins, such as aflatoxins, has been verified by in vitro and consequently in vivo studies, though the results obtained were characterized by inconsistency in many cases. Latest trends are directed to the in vitro prescreening of candidate zeolitic sorbent materials through a multi-tiered analysis system which will reassure the selection of the most potentially efficacious sorbent for further in vivo evaluation and will elucidate several gastrointestinal and feed factors which may interact with chemisorption process. As regards less polar mycotoxins such as zearalenone and ochratoxin A, innovative derivative zeolitic adsorbents with high binding capacity have been developed, according to chemical modifications related to increased surface hydrophobicity.",

From this standpoint of view, recent research efforts provide insights into theoretical mechanisms interpreting the supportive effect of the dietary use of zeolites on animal diarrhoea syndromes, such as sequestration and lack of cytotoxicity of enterotoxins, binding of endogenous substances implicated in gastrointestinal disturbances, earlier restoration of impaired digestive enzyme activity in animals suffered from diarrhoeas or reduction of nema-todes\u00d5 establishment in the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, zeolite-enriched diets exert a clear beneficial effect on the prevention of certain metabolic diseases in dairy cows, as recently evidenced by researchers who underlined the restrictive role of zeolites in the bioavailability of dietary Ca as the interpreting mechanism in the case of milk fever and the improved dietary energy uptake as the one in the case of ketosis.",
