The present study also investigated the moderating role of heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy in the relationship between social media exposure and risk perceptions. The findings of this study showed that social media exposure was positively related to forming risk perceptions. Moreover, heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy were found to moderate the impact of social media on risk perceptions. The interaction effects suggested that the role of social media in increasing risk perceptions of MERS was heighted by heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy. The results and implications of this study are discussed in greater details.",

Because MERS was regarded as an emerging infectious disease outbreak in South Korea (Kim, 2015; WHO, 2016) , South Koreans were largely uninformed about it. Since they were unfamiliar with MERS, they became increasingly uncertain and concerned about the outbreak.",

Especially, for government and risk communicators, the public's risk perceptions of the public health issues can help individuals understand the situation and manage it better. Media outlets, including television and newspapers, have played a large role in informing the public of health issues as well as shaping the public perception of those issues (Lin & Lagoe, 2013; Morton & Duck, 2001; Shim & You, 2015) . In recent years, the numbers of people using social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, has increased, and the use of social media as an informational source for health can influence people's cognition or behavior related to health issues, including risk perceptions and preventive behaviors (Barman-Adhikari et al., 2016; Young & Rice, 2011) .",

For example, the heuristic and systematic processing model suggests that people's systematic or heuristic information processing can play a role in shaping risk perceptions (Trumbo, 1999; 2002) . Moreover, information processing mode can interact with social media to influence people's perception formation. Social media users encounter various sources of information, including elites news information, users' unfiltered or uncensored information, and tailored information that shows their personal backgrounds or interests according to their online networks (Austin, Liu, & Jin, 2012; Lee & Oh, 2013) . Thus, social media use could interact with information processing mode in order to interpret the differential information. As a result, it is likely that the interaction between social media and information processing mode plays a role in shaping ones' perceptions.",

It is specifically constructed by two dimensions: susceptibility and severity (Pask & Rawlins, 2016) . Susceptibility reflects one's perception of the likelihood of contracting a disease, whereas severity refers to one's perception of the seriousness or harmfulness of a disease (El-Toukhy, 2015; Rimal & Real, 2003) . In particular, when people perceive health-related risks, they not only rely on the cognitive aspects of the likelihood and severity of a healthrelated disease, but also use affective aspects of the worry, concern, or dread that a person feels about a health-related disease (e.g., Freimuth & Hovick, 2012; Oh, Paek, & Hove, 2015) .",

Thus, understanding the public's risk perception can help manage public health issues and help them escape from it during an outbreak. Moreover, because MERS is a disease that was previously unknown to South Koreans, few studies have examined how people form their risk perceptions during the MERS outbreak. It is important to explore the factors that influence the formation of risk perceptions during the emerging infectious disease outbreak.",

The media produce and deliver news and information to citizens regarding public health issues (Lin & Lagoe, 2013; You & Ju, 2015) . Since people rely on media as a source of information, the media can help people understand the risks and can shape their perception of the issue.

In media presentation, it was suggested that perceived susceptibility is related to information that would increase achieving a given health condition, such as numerical risk information, while perceived severity is related to information that would include specific outcomes of a health condition, such as death or negative emotions (McWhirter & Hoffman-Goetz, 2016) . In this regard, it is likely that exposure to users' negative emotions, symptoms, or pain concerning MERS could be positively associated with the perceived severity of the infectious disease while exposure to factual information on MERS, such as an increase in number of MERS patients or mortality and fatality rates of the infectious disease, could also be associated with the perceived susceptibility to the infectious disease. As previous studies have examined the risk perceptions embracing both perceived severity and perceived susceptibility as one concept (Hovick, Kahlor, & Liang, 2014; Pask & Rawlins, 2016; Shim & You, 2015) , this study also integrates the two components into one dimension to examine the impact of social media on risk perception. Thus, during the MERS outbreak, social media exposure for MERS-related information is assumed to contribute to an increase in people's risk perception for the infectious disease. We propose the following hypothesis.",

            "text": "On the other hand, heuristic processing involves relatively simple decision rules that require less cognitive efforts and fewer cognitive resources to formulate their attitudes or perceptions than systematic processing (Fiske & Taylor, 1991) . Specifically, because heuristics are represented in a person's memory, people tend to rely on information that is more easily accessible or available stored in their memory when making a judgement that engages in heuristic processing (Kahlor, Dunwoody, Griffin, Neuwirth, & Giese, 2003; Zuckerman & Chaiken, 1998) . As a quick processing mode that allows people to conserve their cognitive resources (i.e., time and effort), individuals who engage in heuristic processing often use superficial cues, such as previously existing knowledge or similar past experiences, when arriving at a judgment about information (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Trumbo, 2002) . For example, in order to form their attitudes toward the GM food issue, people who engage in heuristic processing relied on past experiences from other situations similar to the GM food and their existing knowledge without seeking additional information on the issue (Kim & Paek, 2009 ). Trumbo's research (1999) also showed that under heuristic processing, individuals employed their prior experiences from other situations similar to caner problems and their existing knowledge for arriving cancer risk judgement. In this sense, when engaging in heuristic processing to shape a risk perception of MERS, people are more likely to rely on their past experiences from other infectious diseases similar to MERS and their existing knowledge without seeking additional information on MERS. Thus, the formation and change of an attitude or perception via the basis of heuristic processing may tend to be less stable than that through systematic processing.",

In particular, the association between heuristic-systematic processing and risk perceptions could differ according to a certain context or situation surrounding people. For example, under an uncertain or high concern environment, systematic processing mode was significantly related to a higher level of risk perception for cancer, whereas heuristic processing was significantly related to a lower level of risk perception on the health issue (Trumbo, 1999) . Thus, in an uncertain or high concern situation, such as the MERS outbreak, it is likely that systematic processing may increase people's risk perception, whereas heuristic processing may decrease their risk perception. Therefore, we put forth the following two hypotheses.",

Self-efficacy refers to a person's belief in his or her own capabilities to manage a specific difficult task they are facing (Bandura, 1997) . In the public health areas, this belief results in protection motivation leads to changes in attitudes, perceptions, or behaviors (Dorsey, Miller, & Scherer, 1999) . In particular, some studies have examined the relationship between self-efficacy and risk perceptions, showing that self-efficacy affects people's risk perceptions of a public health issue (e.g., Coleman, 1993; Han et al., 2014) . It has been suggested that optimistic confidence from one's self-efficacy serves as a major predictor for risk perceptions (Han et al.., 2014) . That is, people with higher self-efficacy have lower risk perceptions on a health issue, whereas those with lower self-efficacy have higher risk perceptions on the same health issue. Thus, it is likely that self-efficacy for MERS influences decreasing people's risk perceptions on this health issue. Based on this consideration, we propose the following hypothesis. H4.

In recent years, some studies have suggested that the impact of media use, including social media, on people's cognitions, attitudes or behavior can depend on their individual differences, such as information processing ability or personality traits (e.g., Kim, Hsu, & Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 2013; Lee & Oh, 2013; Yoo & Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 2014) . Especially, because social media are designed to customize individual's interests or needs based on users' active behaviors, such as constructing his/her profile, building online networks, or selecting news information (Boyd & Ellison, 2008; Glynn, Huge, & Hoffman, 2012; Lin & Lu, 2011) , individual's differences could play an important role in considering the impact of social media. Specifically, people tend to seek and acquire varying gratifications when they use media, such as social media (Hyun & Kim, 2015; Kim et al., 2013) . Moreover, individuals often perceive risks depending on their psychological or cognitive characteristics (Sj\u20ac oberg, 2000; Slovic, 1987) , such as information processing mode (e.g., Trumbo, 2002) or self-efficacy (e.g., Coleman, 1993) . Thus, people may utilize social media satisfying their personal needs from their psychological or cognitive differences to formulate risk perceptions (Smock, Ellison, Lampe, & Wohn, 2011) , that which would lead to various levels of risk perceptions toward a given health issue. For example, one's information processing mode has been found to moderate the effects of media on his or her risk perceptions (Ho et al., 2013) . Since heuristic-systematic processing motivates individuals to process information to reach their risk judgements (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) , it is likely that this information processing moderates the relationship between social media and risk perception. That is, heuristic-systematic processing of MERS may help people process MERS-relevant information from social media, which could differently perceive the risk of the infectious disease. Moreover, because self-efficacy indicates the differences in individual abilities to respond or manage situations (Bandura, 1990 ), it has found that self-efficacy moderates the impact of media on one's cognition or behavior (e.g., Lee, Kwak, Campbell, & Ling, 2014) , suggesting that the potential to moderate the association between social media and risk perceptions. That is, in an uncertain situation, such as the MERS outbreak, as individuals hold different levels of self-efficacy, and when they rely on social media for information regarding MERS to form a risk judgement, the interaction between self-efficacy and social media would lead to different levels of risk perception of the infectious disease. From this perspective, we examine how heuristicsystematic processing and self-efficacy interact with social media regarding people's risk perceptions.",

It secured a panel of about 1 million adults aged 19 years and older reflecting nationally representative demographics, including age, gender, and area of residence, by relying on a proportionate quota sampling strategy. The survey was conducted during July of 2015, the peak of the largest MERS outbreak in South Korea. A recruiting email message was sent to a 10,000-member online panel that was randomly selected using a computer algorithm. Among these, 1000 people participated in the survey, and their responses were included in the analysis, reaching at a completion rate of 35.0%. The mean age of the respondents was 45.24 years old (SD \u00bc 13.46, ranging from 21 to 69), and 50.2% were male (N \u00bc 502). The mean education range was between associate degree and bachelor's degree (SD \u00bc 0.96), and the median monthly household income fell into the range of 4e5 million Korean won (equivalent to approximately $3500e4500; SD \u00bc 1.37). According to the Korean Statistical Information Service (2015), the mean age of the total population of South Korea in 2015 was 40.4 years old, and 50.1% were male. In addition, 45% of the South Korean adults aged 25 years and older held an associate or higher degree, and the median monthly household income was of about 4.2 million Korean won. Although people with higher education were somewhat oversampled, the socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants were similar to those of the general Korean adults in general.",

After accounting for all controls, and in response to RQ1, we found that there was a significant interaction effect between social media exposure and systematic processing (b \u00bc 0.08, p < 0.01, See Fig. 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1 , this interaction suggests that the relationship between social media exposure and risk perception was significantly stronger for respondents who engaged in high systematic processing than for those who engaged in low systematic processing. That is, the influence of social media exposure on risk perceptions was significantly more pronounced among those who engaged in high systematic processing. We also found a positive and significant interaction effect between social media exposure and heuristic processing on risk perception (b \u00bc 0.12, p < 0.001, See  Fig. 2 ). Fig. 2 shows that the relationship between social media exposure and risk perceptions was stronger for individuals who engaged in high heuristic processing than for those engaged in low heuristic processing.

            "text": "First, social media exposure was positively correlated with risk perceptions of MERS. As people use social media as a useful tool to obtain relevant information during the outbreak period (Yoo, Choi, & Park, 2016) , this study suggests that social media can affect the formation of risk perception of the infectious disease. At the beginning of the outbreak, traditional media, such as television and newspapers, did not provide sufficient information about the infectious disease (Yoo et al., 2016) , so people might rely on social media as an alternative information source to satisfy their information needs. Moreover, when individuals are not able to access to information from traditional media, they tend to produce information and to disseminate it themselves on the Internet (Tai & Sun, 2007) . For example, people in China largely relied on the Internet as an alternative source of information because the Chinese government and mainstream media controlled the relevant information during the 2003 SARS epidemic (Tai & Sun, 2007) . Social media provide such a public space where users can readily create and share unfiltered or uncensored information that does not appear in traditional media (Austin et al., 2012) . During the MERS outbreak period, social media users were also found to largely express negative words, such as anxiety, fear, uncertainty, risk, and suspicion, with respect to the infectious disease (SBS, 2015). Because people tend to focus more on negative information (i.e., negativity bias; Meffert, Chung, Joiner, Waks, & Garst, 2006) , an increase social media exposure could promote shaping people's risk perceptions of the infectious disease. Second, our findings showed that systematic processing was positively correlated with risk perceptions of MERS. Individuals who engaged more in systematic processing were more likely to have greater levels of risk perception for the infectious disease. This is consistent with previous findings (Ryu & Kim, 2015; Tortosa-Edo, L opez-Navarro, Llorens-Monzon\u00eds, & Rodr\u00edguez-Artola, 2014 ) that systematic processing could increase risk perceptions, especially under an uncertain situation (Trumbo, 1999) , such as MERS, for which South Koreans were unfamiliar and uninformed regarding the infectious disease. This result also suggests that the relationship between heuristic-systematic processing and risk perception should be interpreted in a specific context or situation. As Trumbo (1999) argued, the notion that only people's rational and systematic judgement can decrease unnecessary overreactions to risks needs to be reexamined. Moreover, since systematic processing requires greater attention for acquiring information (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993) , the increased attention could lead to people's risk acceptability by evaluating the information. As a result, people who systematically process information relevant to MERS might arrive at the conclusion that the infectious disease is a serious concern.",

Contrary to systematic processing, heuristic processing did not exert a significant main effect on risk perception. This suggests that heuristics, such as individuals' past experiences with situations similar to the MERS outbreak or existing knowledge without additional information seeking on MERS, did not solely help them perceive risks toward the infectious disease. It would be partially that making a quick, less effortful information processing does not affect the risk perception of MERS because people were largely uninformed about the infectious disease in an environment with a high degree of uncertainty. Instead, it is likely that people who engage in heuristic processing may need other sources of information, such as media, to formulate a risk judgement, suggesting the potential to have interaction effects with social media during the infectious outbreak.",

Specifically, systematic processing was found to moderate the effects of social media exposure on risk perceptions. When people who engaged more in systematic processing were exposed more to information relevant to MERS on social media, they tended to perceive greater risks of the infectious virus compared to those who engaged less in systematic processing. Similarly, heuristic processing played a role in moderating the influence of social media exposure on risk perceptions. The positive impact of social media in increasing people's risk perceptions for MERS was stronger for people who engaged more in heuristic processing than for those who engaged less in heuristic processing. These significant interactions suggest that people process information systematically or heuristically from social media to shape risk perceptions about MERS. This finding shows that exposure to MERS relevant information in social media could play a role in reinforcing the impact of heuristic-systematic processing on elevating risk perception of the infectious disease. The use of heuristic-systematic processing was heightened when individuals were further exposed to information relevant to MERS on social media which might reflect upon the information they obtained.",

Therefore, interpreting the results from the analysis should be made with care regarding inferences that consider the causal relationships between variables. For example, although social media exposure was correlated with risk perceptions, this relationship alone does not present that social media exposure always precedes risk perceptions.

For example, it is hard to deliver specific messages to a large targeted audience through social media, and measuring exposure can be more demanding than with traditional media sources (Hornik, 2016) . For greater validity, future studies should consider more sophisticated measures for the variable. Moreover, since some studies have indicated that exposure could not be sufficient to measure media influence on people's attitude or belief (Shim & You, 2015) , future research needs to use social media attention as a complementary approach to measure social media influence.",

Although self-reported measures are very convenient and common in some fields of media research (de Vreese & Neijens, 2016), the measurement accuracy heavily depends on respondents' ability or willingness to recall their behaviors. This is particularly problematic when answering survey questions about the frequency of media exposure. To solve this problem, researchers should consider many \"gold standard\" measures, such as media diaries, behavioral measures, and video observation for social media exposure (Fikkers, Piotrowski, & Valkenburg, 2017) .",

Although this study focused not on the influence of exposure to a specific message but exposure to social media message, the different sources and types of news and information might result in different exposure effects. For instance, the perceived trustworthiness of information sources, such as media, government, and general public, is a significant factor determining the level of perceived risk and control over an infectious disease outbreak (Pickles & Goodwin, 2006) .

More research is thus encouraged to explore how social media can affect the public's risk perceptions in the public health areas in greater details. 1 The reviewer suggested that some variables did not meet acceptable reliability standards. We used inter-item correlation as a measure of reliability for two-item variables such as risk perception, heuristic processing, and systematic processing. Although there are several arguments on the inter-item correlation cutoff for twoitem scales, Meade and Craig (2012) used an inter-item correlation cutoff of 0.60 to identify synonymous item pairs.
