            "text": "Introduction Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause substantial child morbidity. Sensitive molecularbased assays aid virus detection, but the clinical significance of positive tests remains uncertain as some viruses may be found in both acutely ill and healthy children. We describe disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses and quantify virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs in healthy children during the first 2 years of life. Methods One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus. Results Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32.7%) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3.4%), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058/2646 (77.8%) positive swabs. Viruses were detected in 1154/1530 (75.4%) ARI episodes and in 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs from asymptomatic periods. Respiratory syncytial virus (AFE: 68% (95% CI 45% to 82%)) and human metapneumovirus (AFE: 69% (95% CI 43% to 83%)) were strongly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms. Discussion The strong association of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus with ARIs and lower respiratory symptoms in young children managed within the community indicates successful development of vaccines against these two viruses should provide substantial health benefits.",

It was conducted in the subtropical city of Brisbane, Australia (latitude 27\u00b0 South, average monthly maximum temperature range 22\u00b0C-30\u00b0C, maximum rainfall in December-February, population 2.2 million) between September 2010 and October 2014. Parents consented antenatally for their child's participation. For enrolment, infants needed to be healthy, without congenital abnormalities or underlying chronic disorders, and to be born at term (36-42 weeks). Recruitment was progressive over 2 years at one of two metropolitan hospitals (one private and one government-funded). Detailed methods of recruitment, study design and sample and data collection are described elsewhere. 14 The Children's Health Queensland, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, and The University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committees approved the study.",

We demonstrated evidence of attribution for ARIs by RNA viruses, which included HRV (HRV-A, HRV-C), influenza (IFV-A), parainfluenza (PIV-1, PIV-3), RSV (RSV-A, RSV-B), HCoV (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) and HMPV; and AdV as the single DNA virus representative.

Increasing age \u22656 months, non-summer months and childcare attendance were independent risk factors for symptomatic VDEs. Age as a host risk factor for symptomatic infection is also noted in other studies, 23 and is presumably due to protection afforded by maternal transplacental and breastmilk antibodies in the very young. 24 Environmental risk factors of season and childcare attendance for ARIs may be related to the intensity and opportunity for exposure in these settings experienced by young children. 10 ",

            "text": "The virus-specific attribution of ARIs was quantified by identifying VDEs during asymptomatic periods and calculating the virus-specific AFE, an infrequently reported metric for helping to determine the relative causal roles of different viruses at a population level. A limitation of the AFE approach is that it cannot inform on the aetiology at an individual level: in individual cases it does not differentiate between those with a true positive test identifying the virus responsible for the ARI and those with a false positive result from asymptomatic virus shedding. Nevertheless, knowing the AFE for respiratory viruses can help inform clinicians on the likely clinical significance of detecting one or more viruses in nasal swab specimens taken from infants or young children during an ARI episode, by assigning the group aetiological fraction for viruses detected in that child. Importantly, AFE estimates can be applied to studies of ARIs in different settings to estimate the true burden of disease in the community, thus informing which viruses should be prioritised in future public health policies and interventions.",

These studies are principally cross-sectional, hospital-based and often have poorly matched controls. Consequently, our estimates of AFE being lower than reported elsewhere is not surprising, and, we believe, are likely to provide more accurate estimates of the ARI and LRTI burden attributable to these viruses in the broader paediatric population.",

Previously, the significance of detecting viruses by PCR was tempered by concerns that this may be from an incubating or unrelated subclinical infection or represent continued virus nucleic acid shedding from a recent ARI that has resolved. The intensive longitudinal specimen and symptom sampling from our cohort, as well as the definitions of VDEs and symptomatic VDEs used, helped identify nascent and subclinical infections. In this context, our observations emphasise the frequency of subclinical infections by respiratory viruses in young children, who when otherwise well, may act as important 'silent' reservoirs of infection. Similar observations and conclusions were reported recently in a household study involving both child and adult contacts of symptomatic cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza. 26 Nevertheless, in addition to influenza, established viruses, such as HRV, PIV-3, RSV, and HMPV are also important community respiratory pathogens, especially the latter two viruses, and potential candidates for vaccine and other therapeutic interventions. 27 This contrasts with the novel DNA viruses, HPyVs and HBoV-1, which have low AFEs calculated for both ARIs and LRTIs, despite their higher detection rates. 28 29 However, as suggested by this cohort, synergy may exist between multiple viruses causing ARIs. Unexpectedly, this involved mostly HRV and DNA viruses, and this finding warrants further study.",

Analysis of incidence rates of ARI in participants that withdrew from the study at different periods showed no clear association between time of dropout and ARI incidence. Regular parent-collected nasal swabs avoids the need for home visits by research staff or clinic attendance during an ARI, minimising possible biased estimates of ARI events and specimen availability from losing families failing to seek healthcare. Moreover, regular weekly nasal swab collections increase the likelihood of virus detections during an ARI episode rather than relying simply on results from a single specimen. Our previous work found that with sensitive PCR techniques, parent-collected nose or nose-throat swabs sent to the laboratory by standard mail had comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal swabs obtained by healthcare workers. 18 19 30 Longitudinal data collection also allows assessment of asymptomatic status by considering past and future illness history, as some viruses are detectable days before and after ARI symptoms develop, 31 and are therefore less likely to yield false-positive findings.",

To reduce the chances of false-negative test results, 21 we excluded from analysis 2679 (23.9%) swabs where the internal control for human DNA, ERV-3, was either undetected or present at very low levels. We excluded both virus-positive and virus-negative swabs to avoid overestimating our incidence and prevalence rates. In addition, some viruses were detected rarely, in particular influenza, a finding reflected in other community studies, 17 but nevertheless limiting our ability to provide precise AFE estimates for these agents. We also excluded codetections in individual virus assessments as multiple aetiological agents make individual contributions of each agent difficult to ascertain, but analysed them separately to look at the association patterns of individual viruses. Symptom information, other than doctor-diagnosed otitis media and pneumonia, captured by daily diaries was not validated. To maximise accuracy, parents were trained to recognise symptoms before commencing the study. While healthcare worker-validated symptoms would be ideal, a study of this scale is logistically challenging without parent participation. This study design has been used previously 18 and with others have shown that parents can be trained to recognise symptoms of interest, 18 often as reliably as healthcare professionals. 32 33 Our rates of ARI, including those associated with wheeze, are comparable with other community studies. 34 35 Finally, as is common for these types of studies, families in our cohort were from more advantaged backgrounds and ARI episodes were predominantly of a mild-to-moderate nature. 22 While many children in our study were first-born and from advantaged families, factors thought to decrease the rate of ARIs, secular changes in Australia have led to an increased proportion of children from these families attending childcare at an earlier age than other sectors of the population. A slightly higher proportion (80%-85%) of our cohort attended some form of care by the age of 15-24 months, compared with 74% of children in the Australian population, with childcare attendance an independent risk factor for ARIs. 25 Moreover, the incidence of ARIs in the ORChID cohort 22 is comparable to other reports in this age group 34 36 37 and RSV and HRV-associated ARIs approximate other community-based studies conducted in more temperate climates of Australia (Perth) and Europe. [38] [39] [40] Our findings for this cohort remain valid and provide important estimates on community respiratory virus exposures and ARIs in Australian children in a subtropical, urban setting.",

With molecular methods used increasingly to detect respiratory viruses in young children, our study provides insights into supporting attribution for virus-specific ARIs in this age group managed within the community. The established RNA respiratory viruses and AdV were more strongly associated with symptomatic than asymptomatic infections, while no such associations were found for the newly described DNA viruses, HPyVs and HBoV-1. These data emphasise the high community levels of HRV circulating among children.
