ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.",

The expression distribution of ACE2 suggests that it might play critical roles in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function, as well as fertility. Since the global outbreak of SARS in 2003, numerous studies have revealed the role of cell surface ACE2 as the cellular receptor for SARS-Cov and NL63 [7] [8] [9] . ACE2 has also been proven to be a major receptor of the novel 2019-nCoV because 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV. As the virus enters the cell by binding to cell receptors to complete intracellular replication, virus release, and induce cytotoxicity, the route of virus infection depends on the expression and distribution of the corresponding receptor [10] [11] [12] . Meanwhile, the damage caused by the virus in different organs is closely related to clinical manifestations and has a major implication for understanding the pathogenesis and designing therapeutic strategies in clinical practice.",

We used the online datasets and bioinformatic methods and found out that ACE2, one of the major receptors for 2019-nCoV,expresses quite highly in renal cells, particularly in tubular cells. IHC results showed no ACE2 expression in cells in glomeruli. Renal tubular cells have reabsorption and excretion functions, and play a key role in excretion of metabolites, maintenance of body fluid balance and acid-base balance. Renal tubular cell injury could cause renal tubules atrophy, thereby aggravating renal interstitial fibrosis, secreting a variety of chemokines and growth factors into the stroma, promoting interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, interstitial intrinsic cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. Therefore, 2019-nCoV could enter the renal tubular cell by binding to ACE2, which induces cytotoxicity and abnormal renal function. Examination and follow-up of the renal function of patients infected with 2019-nCoV is necessary to detect the impaired renal function in time and provide early intervention.",
