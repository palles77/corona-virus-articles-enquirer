Colostrum is the secretion milked from the udder at the first milking after the doe kids. This milk will have a much higher concentration of antibodies than the second milking. For best results, the kids should receive colostrum in the first 6 h of life when immunoglobulin absorption is highest. Intestinal absorption decreases after 24 h of age. Kids should receive 60 ml of colostrum (heat-treated if on a CAE prevention program) per kg of bodyweight per feeding for three feedings in the first 24 h. Cow colostrum (heat treated) can be used as a substitute. Most commercial colostrum substitutes have not proven to be effective. Successful feeding of colostrum will increase serum total protein to greater than 5.5 g dl \u00c01 or serum immunoglobulin concentration to greater than 1200 mg dl \u00c01 . The sodium sulfate serum turbidity test can be used to ascertain the adequacy of colostrum feeding. Good prenatal care will help to improve the concentration of immunoglobulins in colostrum. It is useful to have frozen colostrum for emergencies. Colostrum can be frozen in an ice tray and cubes transferred to plastic ziplock bags for storage. Colostrum cubes of appropriate weight can be thawed, heat-treated, and fed to kids. Colostrum should not be thawed in the microwave.",

Kids that have a birthweight higher than 5 kg are also at risk, because of dystocia. Kids that are suffering from hypothermia lack a sucking reflex and may need to be tube-fed to get colostrum into them to provide energy to aid in warming their bodies. A #14 French urethral catheter can be used for a feeding tube. It is carefully inserted in the esophagus and proper placement is checked by feeling in the esophagus and instillation of a few milliliters of water. Kids can be given 60 ml of colostrum per feeding at 2 h intervals until the kid can suck. If a kid is severely hypothermic (rectal temperature <36.5 C), he needs to be warmed either in warm water or by blowing warm air such as from a hair dryer or portable electric heater.

CAE-free goat milk is superior to milk replacers for raising kids since goat milk contains immunoglobulins at low levels. This may be helpful in protecting the intestinal lining and the respiratory tract from infections. It is possible to raise kids on their dams by allowing kids to nurse during the day and separating them from the does overnight and milking once a day in the morning. Kids with access to their dams only during the day will grow well and have the advantage of learning feeding and social behavior from the dams.

Since protein is limiting for a young kid, a higher level of protein would be expected to increase growth rate. Fat is used as an energy source for kids to grow and to keep warm. Other important nutrients are fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, which help maintain the epithelial lining of the skin, gut, and the respiratory systems, which are the physical barriers to infection. Vitamin C, copper levels, and the addition of probiotics should also be listed on the feed tag. Milk replacers should be mixed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.",

            "text": "During the first 4 weeks of life, kids have a very high nutrient requirement, especially for protein (see Figure 1 ). Given freechoice access to milk, kids could consume about 700-800 ml each day in their first week of life, 1200 ml each day in the second week, and 1500 ml each day in the third week. Milk intake will be lower when feeding milk only 2 or 3 times per day. However, feeding large quantities of milk at any one time can cause digestive upsets such as bloat or diarrhea. For this reason, it is preferable to feed three or four smaller meals the first 4 weeks of life or to limit feed milk. An alternative is to provide free-choice cold (5-10 C) or acidified milk, which causes kids to consume numerous small meals throughout the day. Milk or milk replacer can be acidified with dilute formic acid (1 part of 85% formic acid diluted with 9 parts of water) at the rate of 30 ml dilute formic acid to 1 l of milk or milk replacer. This works best if milk is cool at the time of acid addition and the mixture is mixed vigorously. The pH should be maintained between 4 and 4.5 pH paper (test with) to prevent pathogen growth and preserve the milk. Nipple bucket feeders with cooled or acidified milk need only one nipple per three kids in a pen since the kids consume only small meals ( Figure 2 ).",

Many calf starters fit these requirements. Hay should be introduced at 2-4 weeks of age and should be of very high quality, such as an immature alfalfa or vegetative stage grass-legume mixed hay. Uneaten hay needs to be replaced twice weekly. Weaning at later ages such as 12 weeks results in a larger kid and ultimately a larger doe, which may have potential to produce more milk, but at a greater feed cost. Many producers wean as early as possible to reduce feed costs since milk (or milk replacer) is expensive. Minimally, a kid must be at least 6 weeks of age to be weaned, should have a starter intake of at least 250 g day \u00c01 , and weigh at least 10 kg.

Stress such as mixing animals should be minimized and good nutrition is also very important. Neonatal diarrhea is caused by several infectious organisms such as Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidia, and salmonella. The disease is promoted by a buildup of these organisms in the environment, usually as the kidding season progresses and sanitation is neglected. Kids are more prone to diarrhea when fed large quantities of milk at one time. Insufficient colostrum intake may also be a predisposing factor as is overcrowding. Animals with diarrhea should be strictly isolated to prevent the spread of the organism to other animals. They should be taken care of after healthy animals, and one should be careful not to carry the infection on their clothes or hands to healthy animals. Milk-feeding containers may also spread the disease and need to be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. Sanitation should be reevaluated and corrected at the first sign of diarrhea. Most of the common causes of diarrhea are self-limiting and therefore antibiotics are seldom used for treatment. Treatment should follow veterinary protocol. Generally, treatment consists of keeping the kid hydrated and warm. Usually, electrolytes are given to the kid in place of milk for several feedings and milk gradually introduced along with the electrolytes. It is best to give milk in small feedings every 2-4 h. Electrolytes may need to be administered subcutaneously to correct dehydration. Coccidiosis is a protozoal organism that is part of the normal gut microflora and is present in low numbers. Coccidiosis should be suspected in kids over 2 weeks of age that have pasty diarrhea (has white streaks in it) with a history of stress. As the disease progresses, diarrhea becomes watery, causing rapid dehydration of the kid. Goats seldom have bloody feces as observed in other animal species with coccidiosis. Other symptoms of coccidiosis include off feed, listlessness, weakness, and the infected animal may show abdominal pain by crying or getting up again as soon as it lies down. Coccidia parasitize and destroy cells lining the intestinal tract of the goat and the resultant scarring of the small intestine may stunt the kid. The disease is caused by the kid somehow consuming fecal material, such as in the water trough or feedtrough, in combination with a weak, depressed or immature immune system. The immune system can be depressed by the stress of weaning and therefore coccidiosis can be a major problem at weaning. Damp, cool conditions promote the disease because the infective coccidial oocysts survive longer in the environment.",

Feeding acidified milk or yogurt appears to be beneficial. Deccox M can be mixed in the milk and fed for 4 days every 4 weeks as a preventative, or Albon can be mixed in the milk 2 days a week. Good nutrition can help the immune system to prevent coccidiosis. Since older animals have greater immunity to the disease and may shed high levels of oocysts in the feces, young animals should not be housed with older animals. Coccidiostats such as decoquinate (Deccox) and Rumensin are used in feeds to prevent coccidiosis. Animals to be weaned should be fed a feed containing a coccidiostat for 4 weeks before weaning until 3 weeks after weaning. These coccidiostats are best fed when there is a high risk of coccidiosis such as in young animals less than 6 months of age or in animals undergoing a severe stress such as weaning or if there are cool damp conditions.

Tapeworms (Moniezia species) are an ever present problem in young goats raised in semiconfinement (where they have access to grass since a grass mite is necessary for transmission). When kids are allowed to graze during the warm season, Haemonchus will be the dominant problem in warmer climates and can be particularly deadly. Beginning at 6 weeks of age, fecal samples should be monitored for roundworm eggs every 3 weeks to determine when there is a problem with internal parasites. Symptoms of parasitism include diarrhea, pale mucous membranes, thin, poor-doing animal, and edema. In temperate and tropical climates, one can monitor FAMACHA eye scores during the warm season, which assesses the degree of anemia, which could be assumed due to infection with Haemonchus. One should work with a local veterinarian or parasitologist, who should have a good idea of the species and effective treatments. Deworming all animals by some time schedule promotes dewormer resistance and is unacceptable. In the more humid climates of the United States, there is considerable resistance in parasites to dewormers.

            "text": "Dairy kids need to be disbudded so that they do not develop horns, since they will injure one another with horns and the horns will not fit into feed mangers. Disbudding at an earlier age is easier on the kid and it is easier for the operator also as compared to horn removal later. The most popular method of disbudding kids is to use a hot-iron dehorner. This is best done when kids are less than 2 weeks old. The hair around the bud may be clipped. Lidocaine may be used as an analgesic under veterinary supervision if deemed necessary. The kid is best confined to a kid-holding box during this procedure. A hot iron is applied to burn a copper colored ring (approximately 6 s) around the horn bud. It is possible to apply the dehorner too long and cause brain damage. Proper dehorning eliminates scurs (which are parts of the horn that are not killed by burning and that grow in unusual shapes). If scurs occur, they can be reburned if they are small (check kids a month later). Kids are often tattooed at this time if they are to be registered. Every kid should be identified by attaching an ear tag or neck chain or collar (Figures 6 and 7 ) on their day of birth. Because goats and kids like chewing and playing, they can easily lose their tags. To prevent this, an appropriate tag size is recommended, along with a strong material (i.e., metal) and/or a duplicate tag. For LaMancha breed (earless), if a necklace is unsuitable, the tail may be tattooed on the underside.",
