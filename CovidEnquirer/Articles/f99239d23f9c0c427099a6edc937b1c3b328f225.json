More than 8221 persons worldwide have been affected by this disease, and 735 patients have died since June 2003. The case fatality rate is estimated to be 13% for patients younger than 60 years and 43% for those older than 60 years (4) . The 2003 outbreak in Asia demonstrated how SARS can exert tremendous stress on local health care systems and intensive care services, emphasizing the need to identify patient characteristics on presentation that can lead to stratification into different management groups.",

Bilateral disease, multilobar shadows, and the presence of pleural effusion on initial chest radiographs are predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with communityacquired pneumonia (16 -18) . The initial radiographic features of patients with SARS have been described (6, 19, 20) . Our present study of the predictive value of initial chest radiography adds to these earlier studies. We observed that patients with more extensive lung involvement in terms of bilateral disease and more than two zones of involvement had more systemic disease and worse outcomes. Patients with involvement of more than two zones had a higher risk of liver impairment and more severe lymphopenia, which may reflect systemic viral infection. A recent study reported that patients requiring . This new assay, however, is not widely available, and its correlation with radiographic abnormalities is not known. We also found higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and neutrophil counts in patients with greater lung involvement, which suggests that greater lung damage may occur in patients with extensive lung infiltrate on chest radiographs (7). We found that older age, shortness of breath, and lung involvement of more than two zones were independently associated with the need for assisted ventilation or death. Lee et al reported an odds ratio of 1.8 per decade of life (7) , which is similar to our finding. Booth et al (20) found that comorbid conditions, particularly, diabetes mellitus, were independently associated with poor outcomes. In our study, patients with underlying heart disease had a greater risk of poor outcomes. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen status has been shown to be an independent risk factor for progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome in SARS (6) . However, none of our patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen status developed respiratory failure. One patient with hepatitis B compensated cirrhosis died of liver failure despite lamivudine therapy. A high absolute neutrophil count on presentation has been associated with an adverse outcome; this was thought to be related to severe lung injury (7). We could not establish this association in our study.",

Peiris et al observed that 33% of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome had multilobar involvement on presentation compared with only 18% of patients without the syndrome (6). However, multilobar change was not identified as an independent prognostic factor in their study, perhaps because their sample size was too small and their use of a single frontal chest radiograph was not adequate in defining the number of lobes involved. Other reports did not consider initial radiographic abnormalities as a confounding factor for clinical outcome (7, 20) . As there were correlations between chest radiographic findings and other confounding factors, we used multivariate analysis with logistic regression to determine the independent prognostic value of chest radiograph on presentation and found that involvement of more than two zones was independently associated with an adverse outcome.",

In our study, the interobserver agreement on the normality, laterality, and number of zones was generally good. Complete concordance among the radiologists was greater than 80%, which is considered acceptable. It may be argued that quantitative assessment of the total area of infiltrate rather than the number of zones in-volved may be a more accurate indicator of disease severity. Area estimation, however, is highly subjective and may result in substantial interobserver variability. On the other hand, the level of agreement on assessment of type and distribution of opacification appeared unsatisfactory by the statistic.",

Indeed, 23% to 48% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation (1, 6, 7) , and short-term mortality rates range from 4% to 15% (7, 23) . Our study suggests that radiographic evidence, specifically, frontal chest radiograph on presentation, may have prognostic value in patients with SARS. Patients with more extensive lung involvement on the initial chest radiograph had a higher risk of mechanical ventilation or death. Involvement of more than two zones on initial chest film, older age, and shortness of breath on presentation were independent predictors of an adverse outcome.",
