            "text": "The newborn calf's gastrointestinal tract is sterile at birth, but by 3 days of age coliforms, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria are the predominant flora in the feces. During the preweaning period, calves are susceptible to diarrhea that can lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality. Diarrhea has been related with a decrease of beneficial microbiota and an increase of coliform counts in feces. Prebiotic supplements are believed to decrease diarrhea and positively affect some parameters of the immune system. In calves, these supplements have shown some promising effects on intestinal microbial populations but there is limited information about effects on immunity. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate effects of a prebiotic supplement containing fermentation products of lactic acid bacteria on the mucosal immune system by measuring fecal and salivary IgA and to evaluate calf health and growth performance. In this trial 40 Holstein calves were randomly assigned to receive milk replacer with a prebiotic supplement (20 g/day Prebio Support\u2122; Meiji Feed Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) or the same milk replacer with no prebiotic (control). Fecal and salivary IgA, calf health, plasma IgG, and lymphocyte counts were not affected by treatment. Lactobacilli count in feces was higher (P = 0.05) and Bifidobacteria tended to be higher (P = 0.07) in calves fed prebiotic. Prebiotic supplement increased beneficial bacteria in calves, but did not decrease overall incidence of diarrhea in this trial. Calves in this study were all affected by cryptosporidiosis and some were treated with antibiotics, so it is possible that this limited some of the effects of the prebiotic product. Fecal IgA seemed to be a good measure of mucosal immunity, and more studies are needed to develop methods to measure this type of immunity in calves.",

By 3 days after birth, coliforms, Lactobacilli, and Bifidobacteria are the predominant flora in the feces (Ouwehand et al., 2002; Vlkov\u00e1 et al., 2006) . However, in the neonatal calf the microbial population is in transition and extremely sensitive. Sudden changes in diet or environment, disease, or other stress can cause alterations (Krehbiel et al., 2003; Ouwehand et al., 2002) in this microbial system. Newborn calves are often exposed to high levels of stress during the first days of life because they experience changes in environment, diet, feeding conditions, handling, and immunity. It is during this period that calves develop diarrhea, the most common health concern and cause of death during the preweaning period. Calves with diarrhea require prompt attention and care; failure to treat these calves can lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality (Kertz, 2003; Lundborg, 2004; Ribeiro et al., 2009) . Diarrhea has been related to an increase of coliform bacteria counts in the intestines and a decrease in Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria counts (Krehbiel et al., 2003; Ouwehand et al., 2002) . The increase of coliform bacteria in the intestines may produce putrefactive substances and harm the host (Fujisawa et al., 2010) . As a result, gut microbiota are important to the health and development of the host (Ng et al., 2009; Rowland et al., 2010) .",

The bacteria in these supplements, like Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (Ewaschuk et al., 2004) , Lactobacillus acidophilus (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993) , and Lactobacillus gasseri K7 (Bogovi\u010d et al., 2006) , had been proven to survive the gastrointestinal tract to then colonize the intestinal mucosa. Once in the intestines the bacteria in the supplements are believed to improve intestinal microbial balance by decreasing the adherence of pathogens in the lumen of the intestinal mucosa and affecting the mucosal immune system (Isolauri et al., 2001; Ng et al., 2009) . There are many studies with lactic acid bacteria supplements in humans and rodents, and they have shown beneficial effects at the intestinal level, such as decreasing diarrhea in children (Rowland et al., 2010) , decreasing or increasing the numbers of IgA and CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria (Perdigon et al., 1999) , reducing gastric mucosal inflammation in humans (Sakamoto et al., 2001) , and preventing gastric ulcers in rats (Uchida and Kurakazu, 2004) . Also other aspects of the immune system are influenced, such as increasing plasma IgA in humans and increasing the amount of IgA in response to Salmonella typhimurium inoculation in rodents (Erickson and Hubbard, 2000) .",

Calves were removed from their dams within 1 h of birth, fed pooled frozen colostrum for 2 feedings (4 L/day) and then fed transition milk (second and third milking) from their respective dams for 2 days before being changed to milk replacer. Samples of colostrum (20 mL) were collected and analyzed for IgG and IgA using ELISA (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. Montgomery, TX, USA) to be used as a baseline in further calf IgG and IgA analyses.

Bridgewater, NJ, USA) but no other additives. The second group was fed the same milk replacer with Prebio Support (PB; Meiji Feed Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan), according to company recommendations (20 g/day) which contained fermentation products of L. gasseri OLL2716 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ET-3. Addition of PB began on day 2 and continued through week 5; 10 g of product was added to transition milk or milk replacer at each feeding. All milk replacer was fed twice daily at 6% of birth body weight per feeding. During week 6, calves were fed once a day at 6% of birth weight, and weaned at the end of week 6. Fresh calf starter grain and water were offered ad libitum and fed daily from day 1 of age with refusals weighed weekly to monitor feed intake. Nutrient composition of milk replacer and calf starter is listed in Table 1 .",

However, from day 6 to day 10 Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria counts decreased and Clostridia counts increased. This change of bacteria is probably related to the diarrhea that calves developed. Previously, diarrhea has been related with an increase of coliforms and a decrease in Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria counts (Abu-Tarboush et al., 1996) . Higher counts of Bifidobacteria in calves supplemented with this prebiotic product have been found at 21 days of age (Fujisawa et al., 2010) . Since there was some degree of variability in Clostridia levels in the calves and this seems to correspond to when calves had higher scour scores, this finding may merit further investigation to determine if prebiotic treatment could help decrease clostridial colonization in the intestine during this critical time.",

            "text": "In general, PB increased Lactobacilli counts and tended to increase Bifidobacteria counts in the feces of dairy calves, but did not significantly decrease Clostridia and Enterobacteria. The increase of Lactobacilli has been found before in calves supplemented with mixed Lactobacilli during 9 weeks (Abu-Tarboush et al., 1996) and with L. acidophilus isolated from humans and calves (Bruce et al., 1979) . However, in a previous study with this product (PB) in calves, only an increase in Bifidobacteria, not Lactobacilli, was observed (Fujisawa et al., 2010) . The effects of Lactobacilli supplementation on coliforms have been positive in some trials but not in others and may be related to the specific bacteria used. Bruce et al. (1979) found a decrease of coliforms in calves when an increase of Lactobacilli was found, but Fujisawa et al. (2010) and Abu-Tarboush et al. (1996) did not find this decrease in coliform counts. Lactic acid bacteria supplements are believed to increase beneficial bacteria in the intestine and to decrease various pathogens. However, bacteria in the intestines could be modified by many factors, such as diet, disease, stress, or various drugs (Mitsuoka, 2000) . In this trial C. parvum was a problem for all calves and the use of antibiotics was necessary in some calves to help their recovery. Previous results using a supplement of L. acidophilus in waste milk did not find any effect (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993) , but when they used this supplement in milk replacer without medication they found positive results (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993) . Penicillin, chlortetracycline, and tylosin tend to inhibit the growth of mixed cultures of bacteria. It is possible that we could not realize the potential benefits of PB because of antibiotic sensitivity to cephalosporin (Higginbotham and Bath, 1993) . It is possible that because in this trial pathogens did not decrease with the increase of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, we did not find any effects of PB on the health of calves as reported before in calves fed lactic acid bacteria supplements (Abe et al., 1995; Higginbotham and Bath, 1993) . However, some have reported that lactic acid bacteria supplements decrease diarrhea scores at weeks 5, 7, and 8 in calves (Abu-Tarboush et al., 1996) ; these later weeks were not measured in the present study.",

CD21 lymphocytes increased through time from weeks 1 to 5 in both groups and the values reported here were similar to the ones reported before (Kampen et al., 2006) .

However, calves supplemented with L. acidophilus and L. plantarum or L. acidophilus 27SC for 9 weeks had higher serum IgG levels (Al-Saiady, 2010).

Any resecretion of IgA back into the intestines that originated from colostrum could not be determined in this study. The decline of IgA levels reflects the decrease of IgA from colostrum ingestion. However at day 8, when calves started to develop diarrhea, IgA levels increased. This increase of IgA was likely a cellular response to the onset of diarrhea.
