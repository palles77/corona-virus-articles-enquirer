            "text": "The expression of the genetic information of equine arteritis virus (EAV), an arterivirus, involves the synthesis of six subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. These are 5 and 3 coterminal since they are composed of a leader and a body sequence, which are identical to the 5 and 3 ends of the genome, respectively. Previously, it has been suggested that cis-splicing of a genome-length precursor RNA is involved in their synthesis. This was reevaluated in a comparative analysis of the sg RNA synthesis of EAV, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and the alphavirus Sindbis virus. UV transcription mapping showed that the majority of the EAV sg RNAs made at later stages of infection is not derived from a genome-length precursor. However, complete independence of sg RNA synthesis from that of genomic RNA was never observed during the course of infection. The possibility that this resulted from UV irradiation-induced effects on the synthesis of the viral replicase was investigated by inhibiting translation using cycloheximide. For EAV, ongoing protein synthesis was found to be more important for the synthesis of sg RNA than for that of genomic RNA. In general, MHV transcription was extremely sensitive to translation inhibition, whereas EAV genomic RNA synthesis became independent of de novo protein synthesis late in infection. \u1b67",

For example, the MHV analysis shows differences between relative physical sizes and relative UV sensitivities. Our results are in UV target size of MHV RNA 7 calculated by Jacobs et al.

Due to the fact that at that time the length of the MHV genome was assumed to be only 16 kb, instead of the currently known 31 kb, Jacobs et al.

(1992) , who recently repeated the MHV UV transcription mapping experiments, did not describe a detailed quantitative analysis of the data they obtained late in infection, but concluded that UV sensitivities roughly paralleled mRNA sizes.

A single genome-length minus-strand RNA could be the template used for the early stages of infection and that both MHV genomic and sg RNA synthesis at later stages were still significantly synthesis of genomic as well as sg mRNAs. Nevertheless, anti-leader-containing subgenomic minus strands reduced when translation was blocked. In contrast, the EAV data indicated that the synthesis of sg RNAs was in coronavirus-infected cells have been demonstrated (Hofmann et al., 1990; Sethna et al., 1989 Sethna et al., , 1991 . Their more impaired by inhibition of translation than was the case for the production of genomic RNA. In addition, the presence in double-stranded replicative intermediates suggests that these might function in mRNA transcription data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 revealed that sg RNA synthesis is down-regulated relative to the synthesis of (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990 ). On the basis of these and other observations several coronavirus transcription genomic RNA late in infection (Fig. 5) .",
