In companion animals, diseases of the respiratory tract are also common and, although of little economic significance, are important to the health of the animals and thus to clinicians and pet owners. In the past few years, animal shelters have been recognized as a major risk factor for respiratory diseases in dogs and cats, a comparable situation to what is reported in human beings with nosocomial infections.",

Normal bronchioles also lack goblet cells but instead have other types of secretory cells, notably Club cells (formerly Clara cells) and neuroendocrine cells. Club cells, also referred to as secretory bronchiolar cells, contain numerous biosynthetic organelles that play an active role in detoxification of xenobiotics (foreign substances), similar to the role of hepatocytes ( Fig. 9-4) . Club cells are also critical stem cells in the repair and remodeling of not only the bronchioles but also of most of the respiratory tract. In addition, Club cells contribute to the innate immunity of the lung by secreting protective proteins (collectins) and pulmonary surfactant (see B) . In carnivores and monkeys, and to a much lesser extent in horses and human beings, the terminal portions of bronchioles are lined not only by cuboidal epithelium but also by segments of alveolar capillaries. These unique bronchioloalveolar structures are known as respiratory bronchioles ; also see Fig. 9 -1).",

Vulnerability of the respiratory system to aerogenous (airborne) injury is primarily because of (1) the extensive area of the alveoli, which are the interface between the blood in alveolar capillaries and inspired air; (2) the large volume of air passing continuously into the lungs; and (3) the high concentration of noxious elements that can be present in the air (Table 9 -1). For human beings, it has been estimated that the surface of the pulmonary alveoli is approximately 200 m 2 , roughly the area animal and cultured for microbes, yeasts, and fungi, many species of bacteria are recovered, such as Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica in cattle; Pasteurella multocida in cats, cattle, and pigs; and Bordetella bronchiseptica in dogs and pigs. The organisms that constitute the normal flora of the respiratory tract are restricted to the most proximal (rostral) region of the conducting system (nasal cavity, pharynx, and larynx). The thoracic portions of the trachea, bronchi, and lungs are considered to be essentially sterile. The types of bacteria present in the nasal flora vary considerably among animal species and in different geographic regions of the world. Some present in the nasal flora are pathogens that can cause important respiratory infections under some circumstances. For instance, Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica is part of the bovine nasal flora, yet this bacterium causes a devastating disease in cattle-pneumonic mannheimiosis (shipping fever). Experimental studies have established that microorganisms from the nasal flora are continuously carried into the lungs via tracheal air. Despite this constant bacterial bombardment from the nasal flora and from contaminated air, normal lungs remain sterile because of their remarkably effective defense mechanisms.",

The patterns of degeneration, exfoliation, and inflammation in the olfactory epithelium are similar to those of the ciliated epithelium, except that olfactory complications or secondary bacterial infections, a specific type of progenitor cells known as basal cells or nonciliated secretory cells (preciliated cells) , which are normally present in the mucosa, migrate to cover the denuded basement membrane and undergoes mitosis, eventually differentiating into new ciliated epithelial cells (see Fig. 9 -8). Cellular migration, proliferation, and attachment are regulated by locally released interleukins (IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-13), growth factors, integrins and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagen, and fibronectin. The capacity of ciliated epithelium to repair itself is remarkably effective. For example, epithelial healing in an uncomplicated ulcer of the tracheal mucosa can be completed in only 10 days. This sequence of cell degeneration, exfoliation, ulceration, mitosis, and repair is typically present in many viral infections in which viruses replicate in nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelium, causing extensive mucosal ulceration. Examples of transient infections of this type include human colds epithelium. Neurons in the olfactory mucosa have the unique ability to regenerate, a fact that is being explored as a potential source of new neurons in the treatment of spinal cord injury.",

In brief, injury to ciliated bronchial epithelium may result in degeneration, detachment, and exfoliation of necrotic cells. Under normal circumstances, cellular exfoliation is promptly followed by inflammation, mitosis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and finally by repair ( Fig. 9-9 and see . Depending on the type of exudate, bronchitis can be fibrinous, catarrhal, purulent, fibrinonecrotic (diphtheritic), and sometimes granulomatous. When epithelial injury becomes chronic, production of mucus is increased via goblet cell hyperplasia (chronic catarrhal inflammation). This form of chronic bronchitis is well illustrated in habitual smokers who continually need to cough out excessive mucus secretions (sputum). Unfortunately, in some cases, excessive mucus cannot be effectively cleared from airways, which of the bronchial wall or cylindrical when destruction involves a large segment of a bronchus. Grossly, bronchiectasis is manifested by prominent lumps in the lungs (bosselated appearance or having rounded eminences) resulting from distention of bronchi with exudate, which results in a concurrent obstructive atelectasis of surrounding parenchyma ( Fig. 9-11 ). The cut surfaces of dilated bronchi are filled with purulent exudates; for this reason, bronchiectasis is often mistaken for pulmonary abscesses. Careful inspection, usually requiring microscopic examination, confirms that exudate is contained and surrounded by remnants of a bronchial wall lined by squamous epithelium and not by a pyogenic membrane (connective tissue) as it is in the case of a pulmonary abscess. The squamous metaplasia further interferes with the normal function of the mucociliary escalator.",

Chronic bronchial irritation causes squamous metaplasia of highly functional but vulnerable ciliated epithelium to nonfunctional, but more resistant, squamous epithelium. Squamous metaplasia has a calamitous effect on pulmonary clearance because it causes a structural loss and functional breakdown of portions of the mucociliary escalator. Hyperplasia of bronchial glands occurs frequently in chronic bronchitis, which translates to an increase of the Reid index (bronchial-gland to bronchial-wall ratio) (E- Fig.  9 -2). This index is less than 30% in the healthy human lung and in the lungs of most domestic species, except for cats, which generally have an index higher than 40%.

In some forms of chronic interstitial lung injury, the surface of the alveolar basement membrane could become populated with migrating bronchiolar cells, a process known as alveolar bronchiolization or lambertosis. In severe cases, lambertosis, a metaplastic change, can be mistaken microscopically with alveolar adenomas. Type I pneumonocytes are one of the three structural components of the blood-air barrier, so when these epithelial cells are damaged, there is an increase in alveolar capillary permeability and transient leakage of plasma fluid, proteins, and fibrin into the alveolar lumen (see Fig. 9-14) . Under normal circumstances, these fluids are rapidly cleared from the alveolus by alveolar and lymphatic absorption, and necrotic pneumonocytes (type I) and fibrin strands are phagocytosed and removed by pulmonary alveolar macrophages. When there is persistent and severe injury, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may proliferate in the alveolar walls (alveolar interstitium), causing alveolar septal fibrosis, whereas in other forms of severe injury, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts actively migrate from the interstitium into the alveolar spaces, causing intraalveolar fibrosis.

External changes include the presence of rib imprints on the pleural surface when lungs fail to collapse. In addition, the lungs should be inspected for changes in color and texture and distribution of lesions. Color changes can be various shades of red, indicating hypostatic congestion, hyperemia (acute pneumonia), and hemorrhage; dark blue collapsed lobules or areas are indicative of atelectasis; pale pink to white lungs indicate notable anemia, fibrosis, or emphysema; and uniformly or patchy yellow-brown lungs indicate chronic passive congestion and pulmonary fibrosis likely secondary to chronic heart failure. Lungs from exsanguinated animals are generally paler than the normal pink color because of reduced blood in the pulmonary tissue. Lungs with postmortem autolysis show green discoloration, a change that is also seen in other organs (E- Fig. 9 -3). A covering of yellowish material on the pleural surface indicates accumulation of fibrin. Because it is impossible to describe the texture of normal lungs, experience in palpation is required to appreciate the actual texture of a normal lung. Texture is determined by gently palpating the surface and parenchyma of the lungs. Normal texture can change to firm, hard, elastic (rubbery), or crepitus (with a crackling sound or feeling). For a detailed description of lung texture, see the section on Classification of Pneumonias in Domestic Animals. Palpation of the lungs, which should be gentle, also permits detection of nonvisible nodules or abscesses in the parenchyma. Knowing the distribution of a lesion in the lungs also facilitates diagnosis because particular etiologic agents cause lesions with specific distribution. Distribution of lesions is generally described as focal, multifocal, locally extensive, or diffuse. According to their topography, pulmo-nary lesions can also be classified as cranioventral, dorsocaudal, and so on. Necropsy reports must also contain an estimate of the extent of the pulmonary lesions, preferably expressed as a percentage of the volume of the lungs affected. For instance, a report may read \"cranioventral consolidation involving 40% of the lungs.\" If the lungs have focal lesions, a rough estimate of the number should also be included in the report. For instance, \"numerous (approximately 25), small (1 to 2 cm in diameter), hard nodules were randomly distributed in all lung lobes.\"",

From here, inhaled particles and soluble antigens are phagocytosed and transported by macrophages, dendritic cells, and other professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) into the BALT, thus providing a unique opportunity for B and T lymphocytes to enter into close contact with inhaled pathogenic substances. Pulmonary lymphocytes are not quiescent in the BALT but are in continual traffic to other organs and contribute to both cellular (cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor T lymphocytes) and humoral immune responses.

Instead, the main defense mechanisms of alveoli (exchange system) are phagocytosis provided by the pulmonary alveolar macrophages and antimicrobial molecules of the alveolar lining fluid ( Fig. 9-19 ). Pulmonary alveolar macrophages are highly phagocytic cells, which are not to be confused with pulmonary intravascular macrophages, and are derived largely from blood monocytes and, to a much lesser extent, from a slowly dividing population of interstitial macrophages. After a temporary adaptive stage within alveolar interstitium, blood monocytes reduce their glycolytic metabolism and increase their oxidative metabolism to function in an aerobic rather than an anaerobic environment. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages contribute to the bifurcations. Abrupt changes in the direction of air (inertia), which occurs at the branching of major airways, cause particles in the 2-to 10-\u00b5m size range to collide with the surface of bronchial mucosa (see Fig. 9 -1). Because the velocity of inspired air at the level of the small bronchi and bronchioles has become rather slow, inertial and centrifugal forces no longer play a significant role in the trapping of inhaled particles. Here, in the transitional (bronchiolar) and exchange (alveolar) regions, particles 2 \u00b5m or smaller may come into contact with the mucosa by means of sedimentation because of gravitation or by diffusion as a result of Brownian movement.

Mucociliary clearance, also referred to as the waste disposal system, is provided by the mucociliary blanket (mucociliary escalator) and is the main defense mechanism of the conducting system (nasal cavity, trachea, and bronchi) (see Figs. 9-2 and 9-3). Mucus acts primarily as a barrier and a vehicle, and it is a complex mixture of water, glycoproteins, immunoglobulins, lipids, and electrolytes. These substances are produced by goblet (mucous) cells, serous cells, submucosal glands, and fluid from transepithelial ion and water transport. Once serous fluid and mucus are secreted onto the surface of the respiratory mucosa, a thin, double-layer film of mucus is formed on top of the cells. The outer layer of this film is in a viscous gel phase, whereas the inner layer, which is in a fluid or sol phase, is directly in contact with cilia (see Fig. 9 -3 and see E- Fig. 9 -1). The respiratory system of a healthy human produces approximately 100 mL of mucus per day. Each ciliated cell in the conducting system has approximately 100 to 200 motile and chemosensory cilia (6 \u00b5m long), beating metachronously (forming a wave) at a ciliary beat frequency of approximately 1000 strokes per minute, and in a horse, for example, mucus moves longitudinally at a rate of up to 20 mm per minute. Rapid and powerful movement of cilia creates a series of waves that, in a continuous and synchronized manner, propel the mucus, exfoliated cells, and entrapped particles out of the respiratory tract to the pharynx. The mucus is finally swallowed or, when present in large amounts, is coughed up out of the conducting system. If mucus flow were to move at the activated alveolar macrophages. Similarly, inhaled particles, such as dust, pollen, spores, carbon, or erythrocytes from intraalveolar hemorrhage, are all phagocytosed and eventually removed from alveoli by pulmonary alveolar macrophages. Most alveolar macrophages leave the alveoli by migrating toward the bronchiolar (transitional) region until the mucociliary blanket is reached. Once there, pulmonary macrophages are removed in the same way as any other particle: along the mucociliary flow to the pharynx and swallowed. In the cat, as many as 1 million macrophages per hour move out from the alveoli into the conducting system and pharynx.",

In pigs, 16% of the pulmonary capillary surface is lined by pulmonary intravascular macrophages. In ruminants, 95% of intravenously injected tracer particles or bacteria are rapidly phagocytosed by these intravascular macrophages.

Unlike that of tissue macrophages, the life span of alveolar macrophages in the alveoli is notably short, only a few days, and thus they are continuously being replaced by newly migrated blood monocytes.",

The most common viruses incriminated in predisposing animals to secondary bacterial pneumonia include influenza virus in pigs and horses; bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) in cattle; canine distemper virus (CDV) in dogs; and felid herpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV) in cats. The mechanism of the synergistic effect of viral-bacterial infections was previously believed to be the destruction of the mucociliary blanket and a concurrent reduction of mucociliary clearance, but in experimental studies, viral infections did not significantly reduce the physical removal of particles or bacteria out of the lungs. Now, it is known that 5 to 7 days after a viral infection, the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages and, to a lesser extent, the mucociliary clearance are notably impaired (see Fig. 9 -8). Other mechanisms by which viruses impair defense mechanisms are multiple and remain poorly understood (Box 9-1).

Unlike Streptococcus equi ssp. zooepidemicus (Streptococcus zooepidemicus) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis (Streptococcus equisimilis), Streptococcus equi is not part of the normal nasal flora. Infection occurs when susceptible horses come into contact with feed, exudate, or air droplets containing the bacterium. After penetrating through the nasopharyngeal mucosa, Streptococcus equi drains to the regional lymph nodes-mandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes-via lymphatic vessels. The gross lesions in horses with strangles (mucopurulent rhinitis) correlate with clinical findings and consist of copious amounts of mucopurulent exudate in the nasal passages with notable hyperemia of the nasal mucosa. Affected lymph nodes are enlarged and may contain abscesses filled with thick purulent exudate (purulent lymphadenitis). The term bastard strangles is used in cases in which hematogenous dissemination of Streptococcus equi results in metastatic abscesses in such organs as the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, or brain or in the joints.

Typically, the disease is manifested as a transient, acute, febrile illness, which results in inspiratory dyspnea caused by obstruction of the airways by exudate only in very severe cases. Other forms of BoHV-1 infection include ulcerative rumenitis; enteritis; multifocal hepatitis in neonatal calves; nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis; infertility; and in experimental infections, mastitis, mammillitis, and ovarian necrosis. Except for the encephalitic form, the type of disease caused by BoHV-1 depends more on the site of entry than the viral strain. Like other herpesviruses, BoHV-1 also can remain latent in nerve ganglia, with recrudescence after stress or immunosuppression.

Nasal granulomas (atopic rhinitis) are reported mainly in cattle in Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, where affected cattle develop multiple, small, pink or red, polypoid nodules, starting in the nasal vestibule that in time extend into the caudal aspect of the nasal septum (see Fig. 9 -23). These nodules are composed of fibrovascular tissue mixed with lymphocytes (granulation tissue) superficially lined by hyperplastic epithelium with abundant mast cells and eosinophils in the lamina propria (nasal eosinophilia). The microscopic features suggest that hypersensitivity type I (immediate), type III (immune complex), and type IV (delayed) may be involved in nasal granulomas of cattle. Bovine (idiopathic) nasal granuloma must be differentiated from nasal mycetomas, nasal rhinosporidiosis, and nasal schistosomiasis, which also cause the formation of nodules in the nasal mucosa of cattle. An eosinophilic material consistent with the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon is occasionally observed in bovine mycotic granulomas. This phenomenon seen in some mycotic or bacterial infections is microscopically via the ingestion of contaminated feed and water and, very rarely, via inhalation of infectious droplets.

This disease in horses is clinically and pathologically similar to glanders, hence the name pseudoglanders. In human beings, this infection can cause severe sepsis and septic shock and has also been considered to have potential for biologic welfare. Melioidosis is currently present in Southeast Asia and, to a much lesser extent, in northern Australia and some European countries where the causative organism is frequently found in rodents, feces, soil, and water. Ingestion of contaminated feed and water appears to be the main route of infection; direct transmission between infected animals and insect bites has also been postulated as a possible mechanism of infection. After gaining entrance to the animal, Burkholderia pseudomallei is disseminated by the bloodstream and causes suppuration and abscesses in most internal organs, such as nasal mucosa, joints, brain and spinal cord, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and lymph nodes.

In contrast, the septum in pigs with atrophic rhinitis is generally deviated and the conchae appear smaller and asymmetric ( Fig. 9-33 ).

Laryngeal hemiplegia (paralysis), sometimes called roaring in horses, is a common but obscure disease characterized by atrophy of the dorsal and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles (abductor and adductor of the arytenoid cartilage), particularly on the left side. Muscular atrophy is most commonly caused by a primary denervation (recurrent laryngeal neuropathy) of unknown cause (idiopathic axonopathy) and, to a much lesser extent, secondary nerve damage (see the section on Denervation Atrophy in Chapters 14 and 15). Idiopathic laryngeal hemiplegia is an incurable axonal disease (axonopathy) of the cranial laryngeal nerve that affects mostly larger horses. Secondary laryngeal hemiplegia is rare and occurs after nerve damage caused by other pathologic processes such as compression or inflammation of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes are located immediately ventral to the floor of the guttural pouches. As a result of this close anatomic relationship, swelling or inflammation of the guttural pouches or retropharyngeal lymph nodes often results in secondary damage to the laryngeal nerve. Common causes of secondary nerve damage (Wallerian degeneration) include guttural pouch mycosis, retropharyngeal abscesses, inflammation because of iatrogenic injection into the nerves, neck injury, and metastatic neoplasms involving the retropharyngeal lymph nodes (e.g., lymphosarcoma).",

However, in current anatomy, lobes are defined by the ramification of the bronchial tree. Following this criterion, the left lung of all domestic species is composed of cranial and caudal lobes, whereas the right lung, depending on species, is composed of cranial, middle (absent in horse), caudal, and accessory lobes. Each pulmonary lobe is further subdivided by connective tissue into pulmonary lobules, which in some species (cattle and pigs) are rather prominent and in others are much less conspicuous. From a practical standpoint, identification of the lungs among different species could be achieved by carefully observing the degree of lobation (external fissures) and the degree of lobulation (connective tissue between lobules). Cattle and pigs have well-lobated and well-lobulated lungs; sheep and goats have well-lobated but poorly lobulated lungs; horses have both poorly lobated and poorly lobulated lungs and resemble human lungs; finally, dogs and cats have well-lobated but not well-lobulated lungs. The degree of lobulation determines the degree of air movement between the lobules. In pigs and cattle, movement of air between lobules is practically absent because of the thick connective tissue of the interlobular septa separating individual lobules. This movement of air between lobules and between adjacent alveoli (via the pores of Kohn) constitutes what is referred to as collateral ventilation. This collateral ventilation is poor in cattle and pigs and good in dogs. The functional implications of collateral ventilation are discussed in the section on Pulmonary Emphysema.",

Accessory lungs are one of the most common anomalies and consist of distinctively lobulated masses of incompletely differentiated pulmonary tissue present in the thorax, abdominal cavity, or subcutaneous tissue virtually anywhere in the trunk. Large accessory lungs can cause dystocia. Ciliary dyskinesia (immotile cilia syndrome, Kartagener's syndrome) is characterized by defective ciliary movement, which results in reduced mucociliary clearance because of a defect in the microtubules of all ciliated cells and, most important, in the ciliated respiratory epithelium and spermatozoa. Primary ciliary dyskinesia often associated with situs inversus has been reported in dogs, which as a result usually have chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis, pneumonia, and infertility. Pulmonary agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, abnormal lobulation, congenital emphysema, lung hamartoma, and congenital bronchiectasis are occasionally seen in domestic animals. Congenital melanosis is a common incidental finding in pigs and ruminants and is usually seen at slaughter (Fig. 9-50 ). It is characterized by black spots, often a few centimeters in diameter, in various organs, mainly the lungs, meninges, intima of the aorta, and caruncles of the uterus.

Congenital atelectasis occurs in newborns that fail to inflate their lungs after taking their first few breaths of air; it is caused by obstruction of airways, often as a result of aspiration of amniotic fluid and meconium (described in the section on Meconium Aspiration Syndrome) (see Fig. 9 -52). Congenital atelectasis also develops when alveoli cannot remain distended after initial aeration because of an alteration in quality and quantity of pulmonary surfactant produced by type II pneumonocytes and Club (Clara) cells. This infant form of congenital atelectasis is referred to in human neonatology as infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) or as hyaline membrane disease because of the clinical and microscopic features of the disease. It commonly occurs in babies who are premature or born to diabetic or alcoholic mothers and is occasionally found in animals, particularly foals and piglets.

Pulmonary emphysema, often simply referred to as emphysema, is an extremely important primary disease in human beings, whereas in animals, it is always a secondary condition resulting from a variety of pulmonary lesions. In human medicine, emphysema is strictly defined as an abnormal permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, accompanied by destruction of alveolar walls (alveolar emphysema). This definition separates it from simple airspace enlargement or hyperinflation, in which there is no destruction of alveolar walls and which can occur congenitally (Down syndrome) or be acquired with age (aging lung, sometimes misnamed \"senile emphysema\"). The pathogenesis of emphysema in human beings is still controversial, but current thinking overwhelmingly suggests that destruction of mucus plugs, exudate, aspirated foreign material, or lungworms (see Fig. 9 -53). When the obstruction is complete, trapped air in the lung eventually becomes reabsorbed. Unlike the compression type, obstructive atelectasis often has a lobular pattern as a result of blockage of the airway supplying that lobule. This lobular Lungs are extremely well-vascularized organs with a dual circulation provided by pulmonary and bronchial arteries. Disturbances in pulmonary circulation have a notable effect on gaseous exchange, which may result in life-threatening hypoxemia and acidosis. In addition, circulatory disturbances in the lungs can have an impact on other organs, such as the heart and liver. For example, impeded blood flow in the lungs because of chronic pulmonary disease results in cor pulmonale, which is caused by unremitting pulmonary hypertension followed by cardiac dilation, right heart failure, chronic passive congestion of the liver (nutmeg liver), and generalized edema (anasarca).",

Alveolar emphysema characterized by distention and rupture of the alveolar walls, forming variably sized air bubbles in pulmonary parenchyma, occurs in all species. Interstitial emphysema occurs mainly in cattle, presumably because of their wide interlobular septa, and lack of collateral ventilation in these species does not permit air to move freely into adjacent pulmonary lobules. As a result, accumulated air penetrates the alveolar and bronchiolar walls and forces its way into the interlobular connective tissue, causing notable distention of the interlobular septa. It is also suspected that forced respiratory movements predispose to interstitial emphysema when air at high pressure breaks into the loose connective tissue of the interlobular septa ( Fig. 9-55 ). Sometimes these bubbles of trapped air in alveolar or interstitial emphysema become confluent, forming large (several centimeters in diameter) pockets of air that are referred to as bullae (singular: bulla) (see E- Fig. 9 -4); the lesion is then called bullous emphysema. This lesion is not a specific type of emphysema and does not indicate a different disease process but, rather, is a larger accumulation of air at one focus. In the most severe cases, air moves from the interlobular septa into the connective tissue surrounding the main stem bronchi and major vessels (bronchovascular bundles), and from here it leaks into the mediastinum, causing pneumomediastinum first, and eventually exits via the thoracic inlet into the cervical and thoracic subcutaneous tissue causing subcutaneous emphysema.",

Pulmonary congestion is most frequently caused by heart failure, which results in stagnation of blood in pulmonary vessels, leading to edema and egression of erythrocytes into the alveolar spaces. As with any other foreign particle, erythrocytes in alveolar spaces are rapidly phagocytosed (erythrophagocytosis) by pulmonary alveolar macrophages. When extravasation of erythrocytes is severe, large numbers of macrophages with brown cytoplasm may accumulate in the bronchoalveolar spaces. The brown cytoplasm is the result of accumulation of considerable amounts of hemosiderin; these macrophages filled with iron pigment (siderophages) are generally referred to as heart failure cells ( Fig. 9-57 ). The lungs of animals with chronic heart failure usually have a patchy red appearance with foci of brown discoloration because of accumulated hemosiderin. In This type of edema is an integral and early part of the inflammatory response, primarily because of the effect of inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor (PAF), cytokines, and vasoactive amines released by neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and type II pneumonocytes. These inflammatory mediators increase the permeability of the blood-air barrier. In other cases, permeability edema results from direct damage to the endothelium or type I pneumonocytes, allowing plasma fluids to move freely from the vascular space into the alveolar lumen ( Fig. 9 -60 and see Fig. 9 -14). Because type I pneumonocytes are highly vulnerable to some pneumotropic viruses (influenza and BRSV), toxicants (nitrogen dioxide [NO 2 ], sulfur dioxide [SO 2 ], hydrogen sulfide [H 2 S], and 3-methylindole), and particularly to free radicals, it is not surprising that permeability edema commonly accompanies many viral or toxic pulmonary diseases. A permeability edema also occurs when endothelial cells in the lung are injured by bacterial toxins, sepsis, ARDS, DIC, anaphylactic shock, milk allergy, paraquat toxicity, adverse drug reactions, and smoke inhalation (E- Fig. 9-7) .",

The color varies, depending on the degree of congestion or hemorrhage, and fluid may be present in the pleural cavity. If edema is severe, the bronchi and trachea contain considerable amounts of foamy fluid, which originates from the mixing of edema fluid and air ( Fig. 9-61 ). On cut surfaces, the lung parenchyma oozes fluid like a wet sponge. In cattle and pigs that have distinct lobules, the lobular pattern becomes rather accentuated because of edematous distention of lymphatic vessels in the interlobular septa and the edematous interlobular septum itself ( Fig. 9-62 ). Severe pulmonary edema may be impossible to differentiate from peracute pneumonia; (H&E)-stained sections (see Fig. 9 -60), particularly if a fixative such as Zenker's solution, which precipitates protein, is used. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Acute (adult) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; shock lung) is an important condition in human beings and animals characterized by pulmonary hypertension, intravascular aggregation of neutrophils in the lungs, acute lung injury, diffuse alveolar damage, permeability edema, and formation of hyaline membranes ( Fig. 9-63) . These membranes are a mixture of plasma proteins, fibrin, surfactant, and cellular debris from necrotic pneumonocytes (see Fig. 9-55, B) . The pathogenesis of ARDS is complex and multifactorial but in general terms can be defined as diffuse alveolar damage that results from lesions in distant organs, from generalized systemic diseases, or from direct injury to the lung. Sepsis, major trauma, aspiration of gastric contents, extensive burns, and pancreatitis are some of the disease entities known to trigger ARDS. All these conditions provoke \"hyperreactive macrophages\" to directly or indirectly generate overwhelming amounts of cytokines causing what is known as a \"cytokine storm.\" The main cytokines that trigger ARDS are TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8, which prime neutrophils previously recruited in the lung capillaries and alveoli to release cytotoxic enzymes and free radicals. These substances cause severe and diffuse endothelial and alveolar damage that culminates in a fulminating pulmonary edema (see Fig.  9 -63). ARDS occurs in domestic animals and explains why pulmonary edema is one of the most common lesions found in many animals dying of sepsis, toxemia, aspiration of gastric contents, and pancreatitis, for example. A familial form of ARDS has been reported in Dalmatians. The pulmonary lesions in this syndrome are further discussed in the sections on Interstitial Pneumonia and Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs.",

Fragments released inevitably reach the lungs and become trapped in the pulmonary vasculature ( Fig. 9-65 and see Fig. 9 -64). Small sterile thromboemboli are generally of little clinical or pathologic significance because they can be rapidly degraded and disposed of by the fibrinolytic system. Larger thromboemboli may cause small airway constriction, reduced surfactant production, pulmonary edema, and atelectasis resulting in hypoxemia, hyperventilation, and dyspnea. Parasites (e.g., Dirofilaria immitis and Angiostrongylus vasorum), endocrinopathies (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism and hypothyroidism), glomerulopathies, and hypercoagulable states can be responsible for pulmonary arterial thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs (E- Fig. 9-8) . Pieces of this fact is not surprising because pulmonary edema occurs in the very early stages of inflammation (see E- Fig. 9-7) . Careful observation of the lungs at the time of necropsy is critical because diagnosis of pulmonary edema cannot be reliably performed microscopically. This is due in part to the loss of the edema fluid from the lungs during fixation with 10% neutral-buffered formalin and in part to the fact that the fluid itself stains very poorly or not at all with eosin because of its low protein content (hemodynamic edema). A protein-rich (permeability) edema is easier to visualize microscopically because it is deeply eosinophilic in hematoxylin and eosin Fig. 9-104) . 1, Normal alveolar capillary externally covered by type I and type II pneumonocytes and internally by vascular endothelium (see Fig. 9 -14 for more detail). 2, At the early stages of sepsis, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 [IL-1] and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]) cause circulating neutrophils to adhere to the endothelial surface. Following a \"cytokine storm,\" the marginated neutrophils further activated by inflammatory mediators suddenly release their cytoplasmic granules (proteolytic enzymes and elastases myeloperoxidase) into the surrounding milieu (arrows). 3, Enzymes released by these neutrophils cause injury to type I pneumonocytes (arrows) and endothelial cells (arrowheads), disrupting the blood-air barrier and causing permeability edema (curved arrows), alveolar hemorrhage (double-headed arrow), and exocytosis of neutrophils into the alveolar space (double-headed arrow). 4, Extravasated plasma proteins admixed with surfactant and cell debris form thick hyaline membranes along the alveolar wall. 5, In the unlikely event that the animal survives, the healing process starts with alveolar macrophages removing cellular debris, reabsorption of edema, and hyperplasia of type II pneumonocytes (double-headed curved arrow) that subsequently differentiate into type I pneumonocytes (see Fig. 9 B A recognized in the bovine lung after strong pneumatic stunning at slaughter (captive bolt) ( Fig. 9-66, A) . Although obviously not important as an antemortem pulmonary lesion, brain emboli are intriguing as a potential risk for public health control of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Fragments of hair can also embolize to the lung following intravenous injections (see Fig. 9-66 , B). Hepatic emboli formed by circulating pieces of fragmented liver occasionally become trapped in the pulmonary vasculature after severe abdominal trauma and hepatic rupture (see Fig. 9-66, C) . Megakaryocytes trapped in alveolar capillaries are a common but incidental microscopic finding in the lungs of all species, particularly dogs (see Fig. 9-66, D) . Tumor emboli (e.g., osteosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma in dogs and uterine carcinoma in cattle) can be numerous and striking and the ultimate cause of death in malignant neoplasia.

These three pulmonary idiosyncrasies, along with the enormous length of the capillary network in the lung, explain why recruitment and migration of leukocytes into alveolar spaces develops so rapidly. Experimental studies with aerosols of endotoxin or Gram-negative bacteria have shown that within minutes of exposure, there is a significant increase in capillary leukocytes, and by 4 hours the alveolar lumen is filled with neutrophils. Not surprisingly, the BAL fluid collected from patients with acute pneumonia contains large amounts of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-8. Also, the capillary endothelium of patients with acute pneumonia has increased \"expression\" of adhesion molecules, which facilitate the migration of leukocytes from capillaries into the alveolar interstitium and from there into the alveolar lumen.

Excessive exudation of fibrin into the alveoli is particularly common in ruminants and pigs. The fibrinolytic system plays a major role in the resolution of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. In some cases, excessive plasma proteins leaked into alveoli mix with necrotic type I pneumonocytes and pulmonary surfactant, forming microscopic eosinophilic bands (membranes) along the lining of alveolar septa.

Recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) of horses, also referred to as COPD, heaves, chronic bronchiolitis-emphysema complex, chronic small airway disease, alveolar emphysema, and \"broken wind,\" is a common clinically asthma-like syndrome of horses and ponies. RAO is characterized by recurrent respiratory distress, chronic cough, poor athletic performance, airway neutrophilia, bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion, and airway obstruction. The pathogenesis is still obscure, but genetic predisposition, T H 2 (allergic) immune response, and the exceptional sensitivity of airways to environmental allergens (hyperreactive airway disease) have been postulated as the basic underlying mechanisms. What makes small airways hyperreactive to allergens is still a matter of controversy. Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that it could be the result of preceding bronchiolar damage caused by viral infections; ingestion of pneumotoxicants (3-methylindole); or prolonged exposure to organic dust, endotoxin, and environmental allergens (molds). It has been postulated that sustained inhalation of dust particles, whether antigenic or not, upregulates the production of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and monokine-inducible protein ) and neuropeptides (neurokinin A [NKA], neurokinin B [NKB], and substance P), attracting neutrophils into the bronchioloalveolar region and promoting leukocyte-induced bronchiolar injury.

In other cases, such as in paraquat toxicity, the magnitude of alveolar injury can be so severe that type II pneumonocytes, basement membranes, and alveolar interstitium are so disrupted that the capacity for alveolar repair is lost. Fibronectins and transforming growth factors (TGFs) released from macrophages and other mononuclear cells at the site of chronic inflammation regulate the recruitment, attachment, and proliferation of fibroblasts. In turn, these cells synthesize and release considerable amounts of ECM (collagen, elastic fibers, or proteoglycans), eventually leading to fibrosis and total obliteration of normal alveolar architecture.

Type of exudation, with names such as suppurative pneumonia, fibrinous pneumonia, and pyogranulomatous pneumonia 3.

Miscellaneous attributes, with names such as atypical pneumonia, cuffing pneumonia, progressive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, pneumonitis, farmer's lung, and extrinsic allergic alveolitis Until a universal and systematic nomenclature for animal pneumonias is established, veterinarians should be acquainted with this heterogeneous list of names and should be well aware that one the parts of the face with the tip of your finger has been advocated by some pathologists. The texture of a normal lung is comparable to the texture of the center of the cheek. Firm consolidation is comparable to the texture of the tip of the nose, and hard consolidation is comparable to the texture of the forehead. The term consolidation is frequently used to describe a firm or hard lung filled with exudate. pneumonias ( Fig. 9-68) . Texture of pneumonic lungs can be firmer or harder (bronchopneumonias), more elastic (rubbery) than normal lungs (interstitial pneumonias), or have a nodular feeling (granulomatous pneumonias). Describing in words the palpable difference between the texture of a normal lung compared with the firm or hard texture of a consolidated lung can be a difficult undertaking. An analogy illustrating this difference based on touching Changes in the gross appearance of pneumonic lungs include abnormal color, the presence of nodules or exudate, fibrinous or fibrous adhesions, and the presence of rib imprints on serosal surfaces (see Fig. 9 -68).

Before establishing infection, pathogens must overwhelm or evade the pulmonary defense mechanisms. The initial injury in bronchopneumonias is centered on the mucosa of bronchioles; from there, the inflammatory process can spread downward to distal portions of the alveoli and upward to the bronchi. Typically, for bronchopneumonias, the inflammatory exudates collect in the bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar lumina leaving the alveolar interstitium relatively unchanged, except for hyperemia and possibly edema. Through the pores of Kohn, the exudate can spread to adjacent alveoli until most or all of the alveoli in an individual lobule are involved. If the inflammatory process cannot control the inciting cause of injury, the lesions spread rapidly from lobule to lobule through alveolar pores and destroyed alveolar walls until an entire lobe or large portion of a lung is involved. The lesion tends to spread centrifugally, with the older lesions in the center, and exudate can be coughed up and then aspirated into other lobules, where the inflammatory process starts again.",

When pulmonary injury is much more severe, proinflammatory cytokines induce more pronounced vascular changes by further opening endothelial gaps, thus increasing vascular permeability resulting in leakage of plasma fibrinogen (fibrinous exudates) and sometimes hemorrhage in the alveoli. Alterations in permeability can be further exacerbated by structural damage to pulmonary capillaries and vessels directly caused by microbial toxins. Filling of alveoli, bronchioles, and small bronchi with inflammatory exudate progressively obliterates airspaces, and as a consequence of this process, portions of severely affected (consolidated) lungs sink to the bottom of the container when placed in fixative.

Because of the use of effective antibiotics and prevention, pneumococcal pneumonia and its four classic stages are rarely seen; thus this terminology has been largely abandoned. Currently, the term bronchopneumonia is widely used for both suppurative and fibrinous consolidation of the lungs because both forms of inflammation have essentially the same pathogenesis in which the pathogens reach the lung by the aerogenous route, injury occurs initially in the bronchial and bronchiolar regions, and the inflammatory process extends centrifugally deep into the alveoli. It must be emphasized that it is the severity of pulmonary injury that largely determines whether bronchopneumonia becomes suppurative or fibrinous.

The typical phases of suppurative bronchopneumonia can be summarized as follows: 1. During the first 12 hours when bacteria are rapidly multiplying, the lungs become hyperemic and edematous. 2. Soon after, neutrophils start filling the airways, and by 48 hours the parenchyma starts to consolidate and becomes firm in texture. 3. Three to 5 days later, hyperemic changes are less obvious, but the bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar spaces continue to fill with neutrophils and macrophages, and the affected lung sinks when placed in formalin. At this stage, the affected lung has a gray-pink color, and on cut surface, purulent exudate can be expressed from bronchi. 4. In favorable conditions where the infection is under control of the host defense mechanisms, the inflammatory processes begin to regress, a phase known as resolution. Complete resolution in favorable conditions could take 1 to 2 weeks. 5. In animals in which the lung infection cannot be rapidly contained, inflammatory lesions can progress into a chronic phase. Approximately 7 to 10 days after infection, the lungs become pale gray and take a \"fish flesh\" appearance. This appearance is the result of purulent and catarrhal inflammation, obstructive atelectasis, mononuclear cell infiltration, peribronchial and peribronchiolar lymphoid hyperplasia, and early alveolar fibrosis. Complete resolution is unusual in chronic bronchopneumonia, and lung scars, such as pleural and pulmonary fibrosis; bronchiectasis as a consequence of chronic destructive bronchitis (see bronchiectasis [Dysfunction/Responses to Injury and Patterns of Injury]); atelectasis; pleural adhesions; and lung abscesses may remain unresolved there was notable active hyperemia with little exudation of neutrophils; conversely, the process was referred to as gray hepatization in those chronic cases in which hyperemia was no longer present, but there was abundant exudation of neutrophils and macrophages.

A few hours later, fibrin starts to permeate and accumulate on the pleural surface, giving the pleura a ground glass appearance and eventually forming plaques of fibrinous exudate over a red, dark lung (see Fig. 9 -72). At this stage, a yellow fluid starts to accumulate in the thoracic cavity. The color of fibrin deposited over the pleural surface is also variable. It can be bright yellow when the exudate is formed primarily by fibrin, tan when fibrin is mixed with blood, and gray when a large number of leukocytes and fibroblasts are part of the fibrinous plaque in more chronic cases.

Acute interstitial pneumonias begin with injury to either type I pneumonocytes or alveolar capillary endothelium, which provokes a disruption of the blood-air barrier and a subsequent exudation of plasma proteins into the alveolar space (see Fig. 9-14) . This leakage of proteinaceous fluid into the alveolar lumen constitutes the exudative phase of acute interstitial pneumonia. In some cases of diffuse alveolar damage, exuded plasma proteins mix with lipids and other components of pulmonary surfactant and form elongated membranes that become partially attached to the alveolar basement membrane and bronchiolar walls. These membranes are referred to as hyaline membranes because of their hyaline appearance (eosinophilic, homogeneous, and amorphous) microscopically (see Figs. 9-55 and 9-63). In addition to intraalveolar exudation of fluid, inflammatory edema and neutrophils accumulate in the alveolar interstitium and cause thickening of the alveolar walls. This acute exudative phase is generally followed a few days later by the proliferative phase of acute interstitial pneumonia, which is characterized by hyperplasia of type II pneumonocytes to replace the lost type I pneumonocytes (see Fig.  9 -15). Type II pneumonocytes are in fact progenitor cells that differentiate and replace necrotic type I pneumonocytes (see Fig.  9-14) . As a consequence, the alveolar walls become increasingly thickened. This process is in part the reason why lungs become rubbery on palpation, what prevents their normal collapse after the thorax is opened, and why the cut surface of the lung has a \"meaty\" appearance (see Fig. 9 -74).",

Three important gross features of interstitial pneumonia are (1) the failure of lungs to collapse when the thoracic cavity is opened, (2) the occasional presence of rib impressions on the pleural surface of the lung indicating poor deflation, and (3) the lack of visible exudates in airways unless complicated with secondary bacterial pneumonia. The color of affected lungs varies from diffusely red in acute cases to diffusely pale gray to a mottled red, pale appearance in chronic ones. Pale lungs are caused by severe obliteration of alveolar capillaries (reduced blood-tissue ratio), especially evident when there is fibrosis of the alveolar walls. The texture of lungs with uncomplicated interstitial pneumonia is typically elastic or rubbery, but definitive diagnosis based on texture alone is difficult and requires histopathologic examination. On a cut surface, the lungs may appear and feel more \"meaty\" (having the texture of raw meat) and have no evidence of exudate in the bronchi or pleura (Fig. 9-74 ). In acute interstitial pneumonias, particularly in cattle, there is frequently pulmonary edema (exudative phase) and interstitial emphysema secondary to partial obstruction of bronchioles by edema fluid and strenuous air gasping before death.

In other cases, these chronic changes are accompanied by hyperplasia and persistence of type II pneumonocytes, squamous metaplasia of the alveolar epithelium, microscopic granulomas, and hyperplasia of smooth muscle in bronchioles and pulmonary arterioles.

This combined type of pneumonia is in fact frequently seen in many viral infections in which viruses replicate and cause necrosis in bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar cells. Damage to the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium causes an influx of neutrophils similar to that in bronchopneumonias, and damage to alveolar walls causes proliferation of type II pneumonocytes, similar to that which takes place in the proliferative phase of acute interstitial pneumonias.

By definition, lung injury is hematogenous, and the inflammatory response is typically centered in pulmonary arterioles and alveolar capillaries. Lungs act as a biologic filter for circulating particulate matter. Sterile thromboemboli, unless extremely large, are rapidly dissolved and removed from the pulmonary vasculature by fibrinolysis, causing little, if any, ill effects. Experimental studies have confirmed that most types of bacteria when injected intravenously (bacteremia) are phagocytosed by pulmonary intravascular macrophages, or they bypass the lungs and are finally trapped by macrophages in the liver, spleen, joints, or other organs. To cause pulmonary infection, circulating bacteria must first attach to the pulmonary endothelium with specific binding proteins or simply attach to intravascular fibrin and then evade phagocytosis by intravascular macrophages or leukocytes. Septic thrombi facilitate entrapment of bacteria in the pulmonary vessels and provide a favorable environment to escape phagocytosis. Once trapped in the pulmonary vasculature, usually in small arterioles or alveolar capillaries, offending bacteria disrupt endothelium and basement membranes, spread from the vessels to the interstitium and then to the surrounding lung, finally forming a new nidus of infection.",

Unless emboli arrive in massive numbers, causing fatal pulmonary edema, embolic pneumonia is seldom fatal; therefore these acute lesions are rarely seen at postmortem examination. In most instances, if unresolved, acute lesions rapidly progress to pulmonary abscesses. These are randomly distributed in all pulmonary lobes and are not restricted to the cranioventral aspects of the lungs, as is the case of abscesses developing from suppurative bronchopneumonia. The early microscopic lesions in embolic pneumonias are always focal or multifocal ( Fig. 9-79) ; thus they differ from those of endotoxemia or septicemia, in which endothelial damage and interstitial reactions (interstitial pneumonia) are diffusely distributed in the lungs.",

            "text": "When embolic pneumonia or its sequela (abscesses) is diagnosed at necropsy, an attempt should be made to locate the source of septic emboli. The most common sources are hepatic abscesses that have ruptured into the caudal vena cava in cattle, omphalophlebitis in farm animals, chronic bacterial skin or hoof infections, and a contaminated catheter in all species (see Fig. 9-64) . Valvular or mural endocarditis in the right heart is a common source of septic emboli and embolic pneumonia in all species. Most frequently, bacterial proposed that a genetic mutation alters the cell-cell communication between epithelial and mesenchymal cells in the lung. This aberrant cellular communication leads to an overexpression of inflammatory and repair molecules (i.e., IL-4, IL-13, TGF-\u03b21, and caveolin), leading to increased apoptosis and interstitial deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The chronic interstitial (restrictive) diseases in human medicine include \"idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,\" \"nonspecific interstitial pneumonia,\" \"unusual interstitial pneumonia,\" and \"cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,\" also referred to as idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (idiopathic BOOP). Feline idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an example of this type of progressive interstitial disease in veterinary medicine. It has been reported that in rare cases, chronic alveolar remodeling and interstitial fibrosis can progress to lung cancer. The lung has numerous circular areas of hemorrhage distributed randomly throughout all lung lobes (embolic pattern [see Fig. 9 -68]). These foci arise from injury to the microvasculature in alveolar septa and the visceral pleura secondary to lodgment of bacterial or fungal emboli (septic emboli) from valvular or mural endocarditis in the right heart or from other bacterial or fungal diseases where the bacterium or fungus gains access to the circulatory system as occurs in many bacterial and fungal enteritides or pneumonias caused by Salmonella spp., E. coli, or Aspergillus spp. The pathogenesis of granulomatous pneumonia shares some similarities with that of interstitial and embolic pneumonias. Not surprisingly, some pathologists group granulomatous pneumonias within one of these types of pneumonias (e.g., granulomatous interstitial pneumonia). What makes granulomatous pneumonia a distinctive type is not so much the portal of entry or site of initial injury in the lungs but, rather, the unique type of inflammatory response that results in the formation of granulomas, which can be easily recognized at gross and microscopic examination. As a rule, agents causing granulomatous pneumonias are resistant to intracellular killing by phagocytic cells and to the acute inflammatory response, allowing prolonged persistence of these agents in tissues.",

First, as pure viral infections, their severity may range from mild to severe, making them a frequent interfering factor in training and athletic performance. Second, superimposed infections by opportunistic bacteria, such as Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhodococcus equi, and various anaerobes, can cause fibrinous or suppurative bronchopneumonias. Third, it is possible Equine Henipavirus (Hendra Virus). Fatal cases of a novel respiratory disease in horses and human beings suddenly appeared in approximately 1994 in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane, Australia. This outbreak was attributed to a newly recognized zoonotic virus that was tentatively named equine Morbillivirus. Now called Hendra virus (HeV), this emerging viral pathogen is currently classified as a member of the genus Henipavirus (includes Hendra virus and Nipah virus), in the family Paramyxoviridae. Fruit bats (flying foxes) act as natural reservoirs and are involved in the transmission by poorly understood mechanisms. The lungs of affected horses are severely edematous with gelatinous distention of pleura and subpleural lymph vessels.

Although half of foals with pneumonia have ulcerative enterocolitis, it is rare to find animals with intestinal lesions alone. Occasionally, infection disseminates to lymph nodes, joints, bones, the genital tract, and other organs. Because Rhodococcus equi is present in soil and feces of herbivores (particularly foals), it is common for the disease to become enzootic on farms (\"hot spots\") where the organism has been shed earlier by infected foals. Serologic evidence of infection in horses is widespread, yet clinical disease is sporadic and largely restricted to young foals or to adult horses with severe immunosuppression. Virulence factors encoded by plasmids (virulenceassociated protein A [vapA gene]) are responsible for the survival and replication of Rhodococcus equi in macrophages, thus determining the evolution of the disease.

In young foals, the infection starts as a suppurative cranioventral bronchopneumonia, which progresses within a few days into small variable-size pulmonary abscesses. These abscesses rapidly transform into pyogranulomatous nodules, some of which become confluent and form large masses of caseous exudate ( Fig. 9-82 ). Microscopically, the early lesion starts with neutrophilic infiltration, followed by an intense influx of alveolar macrophages into the bronchoalveolar spaces. This type of histiocytic inflammation persists for a long period of time because Rhodococcus equi is a facultative intracellular organism that survives the bactericidal effects of equine alveolar macrophages. In the most chronic cases, the pulmonary lesions culminate with the formation of large caseonecrotic masses with extensive fibrosis of the surrounding pulmonary parenchyma.

Enzootic pneumonia, sometimes simply referred to as calf pneumonia, is a multifactorial disease caused by a variety of etiologic agents that produces an assortment of lung lesions in young, intensively housed calves. The hostmicrobial-environmental triad is central in the pathogenesis of this disease. Morbidity is often high (up to 90%), but fatalities are uncommon (>5%) unless management is poor or unless new, virulent pathogens are introduced by additions to the herd. Enzootic pneumonia is also called viral pneumonia because it often begins with an acute respiratory infection with BPIV-3, BRSV, or possibly with one or more of several other viruses (adenovirus, BoHV-1, reovirus, bovine coronavirus [BCoV] , and bovine rhinitis virus). Mycoplasmas, notably Mycoplasma dispar, Mycoplasma bovis, Ureaplasma, and possibly Chlamydophila, may also be primary agents. Following infection with any of these agents, opportunistic bacteria, such as Pasteurella multocida, Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Escherichia coli, can cause a secondary suppurative bronchopneumonia, the most serious stage of enzootic pneumonia. The pathogenesis of the primary invasion and how it predisposes the host to invasion by the opportunists are poorly understood, but it is likely that there is impairment of pulmonary defense mechanisms. Environmental factors, including air quality (poor ventilation), high relative humidity, and animal crowding, have been strongly incriminated. The immune status of the calf also plays an important role in the development and severity of enzootic pneumonia. Calves with bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD), which prevents the migration of neutrophils from the capillaries, are highly susceptible to bronchopneumonia.",

Shipping fever (transit fever) is a vague clinical term used to denote acute respiratory diseases that occur in cattle several days or weeks after shipment. The disease is characterized by a severe fibrinous bronchopneumonia, reflecting the fact that death generally occurs early or at an acute stage. Because Mannheimia haemolytica (formerly Pasteurella haemolytica) is most frequently isolated from affected lungs, the names pneumonic mannheimiosis and pneumonic pasteurellosis have been used synonymously. It is known that pneumonic mannheimiosis can occur in animals that have not been shipped and that organisms other than Mannheimia haemolytica can cause similar lesions. Therefore the term shipping fever should be relinquished in favor of more specific names, such as pneumonic mannheimiosis or respiratory histophilosis. irregular areas of coagulative necrosis are typically bordered by a rim of elongated cells often referred to as oat-shaped cells or oat cells that are degenerating neutrophils mixed with a few alveolar macrophages (see Fig. 9 -86). In the early stages of necrosis, there is no evidence of vascular thrombosis, suggesting that necrosis is primarily caused by the cytotoxin of Mannheimia haemolytica and is not the result of an ischemic change. The interlobular septa become distended with protein-rich edematous fluid, and the lymphatic vessels contain fibrin thrombi. The trachea and bronchi can have considerable amounts of blood and exudate, which are transported by the mucociliary escalator or coughed up from deep within the lungs, but the walls of the trachea and major bronchi may or may not be involved. Because of the necrotizing process, sequelae to pneumonic mannheimiosis can be serious and can include abscesses, encapsulated sequestra (isolated pieces of necrotic lung), chronic pleuritis, fibrous pleural adhesions, and bronchiectasis. Clinically, pneumonic mannheimiosis is characterized by a severe toxemia that can kill animals even when considerable parts of the lungs remain functionally and structurally normal.

It was eradicated from North America in 1892 and from Australia in the 1970s, but it is still enzootic in large areas of Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe.

Natural infection occurs in cattle and Asian buffalo. The portal of entry is aerogenous, and infections occur when a susceptible animal inhales infected droplets. The pathogenic mechanisms are still inadequately understood but are suspected to involve toxin and galactan production, unregulated production of TNF-\u03b1, ciliary dysfunction, immunosuppression, and immune-mediated vasculitis.

It was first used to describe acute or chronic forms of bovine pneumonia that did not fit in any of the \"classic\" forms because of the lack of exudate and lack of productive cough. Microscopically, the criteria for diagnosis of AIP in cattle were based on the absence of obvious exudate and the presence of edema, interstitial emphysema (see the section on Pulmonary Emphysema), hyaline membranes, hyperplasia of type II pneumonocytes, and alveolar fibrosis with interstitial cellular infiltrates. At that time, any pulmonary disease or pulmonary syndrome that had a few of the previously mentioned lesions was traditionally diagnosed as AIP, and grouping all these different syndromes together was inconsequential because their etiopathogenesis were then unknown.",

The most common bovine syndromes characterized by edema, emphysema, hyaline membranes, and hyperplasia of type II pneumonocytes include bovine pulmonary edema and emphysema (fog fever), \"extrinsic allergic alveolitis\" (hypersensitivity pneumonitis), \"reinfection syndromes\" (hypersensitivity to Dictyocaulus sp. or BRSV), milk allergy, ingestion of moldy potatoes, paraquat toxicity, toxic silo gases, mycotoxins, and others.",

Atelectasis is confined to the lobules of the lungs ventilated by the obstructed bronchi (dorsocaudal). Interstitial emphysema (interlobular) is caused by forced expiratory movements against a partially obstructed single bronchus. In addition to the inflammation of bronchial mucosa, bronchoaspiration of larvae and eggs also causes an influx of leukocytes into the bronchoalveolar space (alveolitis). Verminous pneumonia is most commonly seen in calves during their first summer grazing pastures that are repeatedly used from year to year, particularly in regions of Europe that have a moist cool climate. The parasite can overwinter in pastures, even in climates as cold as Canada's, and older animals may be carriers for a considerable length of time.",

B, ROS produced by Club cells are also absorbed into capillaries within the lamina propria and are transferred by the circulatory system to pulmonary capillaries where they disrupt the air-blood barrier, causing degeneration and necrosis of type I pneumonocytes. This process leads to leakage of plasma fluid (alveolar edema [pink color]) and extravasation of erythrocytes (alveolar hemorrhage) and neutrophils (inflammation). Ingested pneumotoxicants can be metabolized by the liver, leading to release of ROS into the circulatory system that then disrupts the air-blood barrier in a similar manner. Fig.  9 -77). Microscopically, there are focal intraalveolar hemorrhages caused by larvae migrating through the alveolar walls. Some larvae admixed with edematous fluid and cellular exudate (including eosinophils) may be visible in bronchioles and alveoli. The alveolar walls are thickened because of edema and a few inflammatory cells. Clinical signs include cough and expiratory dyspnea to the point of oral breathing. Hydatid cysts, the intermediate stage of Echinococcus granulosus, can be found in the lungs and liver and other viscera of sheep and to a lesser extent in cattle, pigs, goats, horses, and human beings. The adult stage is a tapeworm that parasitizes the intestine of Canidae. Hydatidosis is still an important zoonosis in some countries, and perpetuation of the parasite life cycle results from animals being fed uncooked offal from infected sheep and consumption of uninspected meat. Hydatid cysts are generally 5 to 15 cm in diameter, and numerous cysts can be found in the viscera of affected animals ( Fig. 9-91 ). Each parasitic cyst is filled with clear fluid; numerous daughter cysts attach to the wall, each containing several \"brood capsules\" with protoscolices inside. Hydatid cysts have little clinical significance in animals but are economically important because of carcass condemnation. Aspiration Pneumonias. The inhalation of regurgitated ruminal contents or iatrogenic deposition of medicines or milk into the trachea can cause severe and often fatal aspiration pneumonia. Bland substances, such as mineral oil, may incite only a mild suppurative or histiocytic bronchopneumonia, whereas some \"home remedies\" or ruminal contents are highly irritating and cause a fibrinous, necrotizing bronchopneumonia. The right cranial lung lobe tends to be more severely affected because the right cranial bronchus is the most cranial branch and enters the ventrolateral aspect of the trachea. However, the distribution may vary when animals aspirate while in lateral recumbency. In some severe cases, pulmonary necrosis can be complicated by infection with saprophytic organisms present in ruminal contents, causing fatal gangrenous pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia should always be considered in animals whose swallowing has been compromised-for example, those with cleft palate or hypocalcemia (milk fever). On the other hand, neurological diseases such as encephalitis (e.g., rabies) or encephalopathy (e.g., lead poisoning) should be investigated in animals in which the cause of aspiration pneumonia could not be caused by persistent immunologic stimuli; hypertrophy and hyperplasia of bronchiolar smooth muscle because of increased contraction and decreased muscle relaxation; and a few eosinophilic granulomas around the eggs and dead larvae. These granulomas, grossly, are gray, noncaseated nodules (2 to 4 mm in diameter) and may be confused with those seen at the early stages of tuberculosis.",

Horizontal transmission between infected and susceptible goats via the respiratory route has also been described. After coming into contact with mucosal cells at the portal of entry, the virus is phagocytized by macrophages, which migrate to the regional lymph nodes. Infected macrophages are disseminated hematogenously to the central nervous system, joints, lungs, and mammary glands.

Gross lesions include a distinctive necrotizing pharyngitis and tonsillitis; ulcerative esophagitis (E- Fig. 9-20) ; severe congestion and edema of the lungs; focal hepatic necrosis; and petechiae in the mucosa of the tongue, esophagus, and intestine and particularly in the lungs and pleura.",

Diagnosis of PRRS in tissue collected at necropsy can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry and PCR techniques. Infected pigs may become carriers and transmit the infection through body fluids and semen. Clinically, PRRS in nursery and young growing animals is characterized by sneezing, fever, anorexia, dyspnea, cough, and occasional death. Some piglets develop severe cyanosis of the abdomen and ears, which explains why this syndrome was named blue ear disease when first described in Europe.",

Another emerging porcine syndrome, characterized clinically by progressive emaciation in weaned pigs, was originally described in the 1990s in Canada, the United States, and Europe. Since then, it has disseminated to many countries, causing economic devastation in pig farms worldwide. Because of the clinical signs and lesions in many organs, this syndrome was named postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) has been incriminated as the etiologic agent and is a member of the Circoviridae family. PCV2 has been associated with a number of syndromes in pigs, including systemic PCV2 infection (the preferred term for PMWS because it may also affect mature pigs), PCV2-associated pneumonia, PCV2-associated enteritis, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), PCV2-associated reproductive failure, and, most recently, PCV2-associated cerebellar vasculitis. The diseases caused by PCV2 are now collectively known as porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD); the most common manifestations are systemic PCV2 infection (PMWS) and PCV2-associated pneumonia as part of the porcine respiratory disease complex. All of these manifestations affect more than one organ, and there is substantial overlap between the syndromes.",

Although the pathogenesis of porcine enzootic pneumonia is not completely elucidated, it is known that Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae first adheres to the cilia of the bronchi by means of a unique adhesive protein, produces ciliostasis, and finally colonizes the respiratory system by firmly attaching to the ciliated epithelial cells of the trachea and the bronchi of the cranioventral regions of the lungs. Once attached to the respiratory epithelium, it provokes an influx of neutrophils into the tracheobronchial mucosa; causes extensive loss of cilia (deciliation); stimulates an intense hyperplasia of lymphocytes in the BALT; and attracts mononuclear cells into the factors have been identified.

Porcine pleuropneumonia is an increasingly important cause of acute and chronic pneumonias, particularly in intensively raised pigs (2 to 5 months old).

Considered a primary pathogen, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae can sporadically produce septicemia in young pigs and otitis media and otitis interna with vestibular syndrome in weaned pigs. Two biovars and 15 serotypes of the organism have been identified; all serotypes can cause the disease, but differences in virulence exist.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) is transmitted to susceptible puppies through infected body fluids. The virus invades through the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva, proliferates in regional lymph nodes, becomes viremic, and in dogs with an inadequate antibody response, infects nearly all body tissues (pantropic), particularly the epithelial cells. Distemper virus hampers the immune response, downregulates cytokine production, and persists for a long time in some tissues. CDV can target the lungs either directly as a viral pneumonia or indirectly by its immunosuppressive effects rendering the lungs susceptible to secondary bacterial and protozoal infections, or as a coinfection with other viruses such as canine adenovirus-2 and canid herpesvirus 1. 15:292-294, 2003.) inclusion bodies occur within epithelial cells in early lesions.

Canine influenza is an emerging contagious respiratory infection of dogs that was first described in the United States and subsequently in other countries. It has a high morbidity (close to 100%), but the mortality, as with most other influenza infections, is relatively low (less than 8%). This disease, first diagnosed in greyhounds, is caused by a novel influenza-A virus (canine influenza virus or CIV), a mutation from a previously recognized H3N8 strain of equine influenza virus. Dog-to-dog transmission does occur and therefore this infection must be distinguished from other viruses of the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) group. Pulmonary lesions are generally mild and transient, but infected dogs are susceptible to secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia. The most relevant lesions in dogs dying unexpectedly from canine influenza are pleural and pulmonary hemorrhages. Microscopically, there is necrotizing tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis with exudation of neutrophils and macrophages. In severe cases, hemorrhagic interstitial or bronchointerstitial pneumonia may be accompanied by vasculitis and thrombosis. Influenza antigen can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages. Clinically, dogs with canine influenza are lethargic, inappetent, and hyperthermic and frequently cough and show nasal discharge. These signs resemble those seen in dogs with kennel cough or secondary bacterial pneumonia. In addition, there are confirmed cases of canine influenza caused by the porcine H1N1 presumably transmitted from infected pet owners.",

CAV-2 infection is a common but transient contagious disease of the respiratory tract of dogs, causing mild fever, oculonasal discharge, coughing, and poor weight gain. The portal of entry is generally by inhalation of infected aerosols followed by viral replication in the surface cells of the upper respiratory tract, mucous cells of the trachea and bronchi, nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, and type II pneumonocytes. Pulmonary lesions are initially those of bronchointerstitial pneumonia, with necrosis and exfoliation of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, edema, and, a few days later, proliferation of type II pneumonocytes, mild infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the alveolar interstitium, and hyperplastic bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Large basophilic intranuclear viral inclusions are typically seen in bronchiolar and alveolar cells ( Fig. 9-101) . Infection with CAV-2 is clinically mild unless complicated with a secondary bacterial infection or coinfections with other viruses such as distemper virus.

In severe cases, dogs and cats die rapidly from septic shock and ARDS (see Fig. 9 -63), which is microscopically characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, protein-rich pulmonary edema, neutrophilic alveolitis, and formation of typical hyaline membranes along the alveolar walls (see Fig. 9-104 ). In animals that survive the acute stages of aspiration, pulmonary lesions progress to bronchopneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is a common sequela to disseminates systemically to other organs. Clinical signs relate to the location of lesions, so there can be respiratory distress, lameness, generalized lymphadenopathy, or cutaneous lesions, among others.",

The gross lesions are multifocal, amber, and subpleural granulomatous nodules up to 1 cm in diameter throughout the lungs. On incision, these nodules may contain viscous exudate. Microscopically, the adult parasites, eggs, and coiled larvae are in the bronchioles and alveoli, where they cause catarrhal bronchiolitis, hyperplasia of submucosal glands, and, later, granulomatous alveolitis, alveolar fibrosis, and fibromuscular hyperplasia ( Fig.  9-107) . During routine examination of feline lungs, it is quite common to find fibromuscular hyperplasia in bronchioles and arterioles in otherwise healthy cats. It was alleged in the past that this fibromuscular hyperplasia was a long-term sequela of subclinical infection with Aelurostrongylus abstrusus. However, this view has been challenged; thus the pathogenesis and significance of pulmonary fibromuscular hyperplasia in healthy cats remains uncertain. In severe cases, fibromuscular hyperplasia is grossly visible in the lungs as white subpleural nodules.",

The pathogenesis of MAS is basically the same as in those of fetal bronchopneumonia (see Fig. 9-109) . Fetal hypoxia, a common event during dystocia or prolonged parturition, causes the fetus to relax the anal sphincter and release meconium into the amniotic fluid. Aspiration of meconium can occur directly from aspirating contaminated amniotic fluid before delivery (respiratory movements with an open glottis) or immediately after delivery when the meconium lodged in the nasopharynx is carried into the lung with the first breath of air. This latter form of aspiration is prevented in delivery rooms by routine suction of the nasopharynx in meconium-stained babies. MAS is well known in human babies, but the occurrence and significance in animals remains largely unknown. MAS has been reported in calves, foals, piglets, and puppies. Although pulmonary lesions are generally mild and transient, aspiration of meconium can be life-threatening for newborn babies and animals because it typically occurs in compromised neonates already suffering from intrauterine hypoxia and acidosis. Neonatal acidosis is known to impair colostrum absorption in calves. Common MAS sequelae are lobular atelectasis, pulmonary hypertension, and possibly airway hyperreactivity.",

Carcinoid tumor of the lungs is a neoplasm presumably arising from neuroendocrine cells and is sporadically seen in dogs as multiple, large, firm pulmonary masses close to the mainstem bronchi. It has also been reported in the nasal cavity of horses. Tumor cells are generally polygonal with finely granular, pale, or slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei are small, and mitotic figures are absent or rare. Granular Cell Tumor. Granular cell tumor is a rare and locally invasive tumor that has been reported mainly in human beings and older horses. The cell origin of this tumor was thought to be the myoblast, but it is currently presumed to be Schwann cells, which are normally present in the bronchovascular bundles of the lung. Microscopically, neoplastic cells are large, polyhedron-shaped with metastatic carcinomas are generally similar to the primary neoplasm and sometimes have umbilicated centers. Proper diagnoses of pulmonary neoplasms in live animals require history, clinical signs, radiographs, cytologic analysis of BAL fluid, and, when necessary, a lung biopsy. Identification of a specific lineage of neoplastic cells in biopsy or postmortem specimens is often difficult and requires electron microscopy or immunohistochemical techniques. Electron microscopy allows identification of distinctive cellular components such as osmiophilic lamellar phospholipid nephritic bodies in alveolar type II epithelial cells or melanosomes in melanomas. Immunohistochemical staining is also helpful in identifying tumor cells.",
