The results presented demonstrate that MHV-4 can selectively block y-interferoninduced class II antigen expression on cerebral endothelial cells. The blocking effect of class II expression occurs in a strain-dependent manner, and is limited to virus-susceptible mouse strains. Virus replication is not required to obtain the blocking effect since UV-inactivated MHV-4 produces the same result. MHV-4 blocking of y-interferon-induced class II antigen expression is observed at both the cell surface (flow cytometry) and transcriptional level (Northern analysis).",

            "text": "Murine cerebral vascular endothelial cells are integral components of the blood-brain barrier, and are believed to be an important site which can restrict infection of the central nervous system (CNS) by viruses and other pathogens (John-son, 1974 (John-son, , 1982 Wiley et al., 1986; Zurbriggen and Fujinami, 1988; Dropulic et al., 1990) . A potential role of cerebral vascular endothelial cells in resisting CNS infection relates to their expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and its impact on viral antigen presentation and generation of anti-viral cytotoxic T cell activity (Hirschberg, 1981; Collins et al., 1984; McCarron et al., 1985 McCarron et al., , 1986 Pober et al., 1985 Pober et al., , 1986 . MHV-4 (mouse hepatitis virus, JHM strain) is a member of the coronavirus family that has been studied in models of virus infections of the CNS (Bailey et al., 1949) . We previously reported the modulation of MHC class I antigens and the lack of effect on class II antigen expression, following MHV-4 infection of mouse cerebral vascular endothelial cells from selected mouse strains (Joseph et al., 1989) . Other investigators have also shown class I modulation on mouse glial cells by a related coronavirus, MHV-A59 (Suzumura et al., 1986) . The results presented in this report show a novel regulatory effect of MHV-4 on MHC expression, i.e., the ability to block y-interferon-induced class lI induction on cerebral vascular endothelial cells. This occurs in a strain-dependent manner. Virus replication is not required to obtain the blocking effect since comparable results were obtained when cells were exposed to UV-inactivated MHV-4. The relevance of these findings in understanding immunopathologic events in the CNS following MHV-4 infection is discussed.",

SJL-derived cells lack a virus-binding receptor for MHV (Boyle et al., 1987) .

MHV-4 is able to selectively block y-interferon-induced class II but not class I antigen expression in a strain-dependent manner. The actual mechanism by which MHV-4 blocks class II antigen expression induced by y-interferon is not yet clear. Similar findings have been described with the Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV), which carries the v-Ki-ras oncogene. Ki-MSV prevents class II MHC antigen (H-2A) induction by y-interferon on C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts (Maudsley and Morris, 1989a, b) . In the Ki-MSV system it has been suggested that interferon response sequences identified in the virus genome might act in trans to down-regulate MHC expression. The human hepatitis B virus (HBV, double-stranded DNA virus) has also been shown to have downregulatory effects on a-interferon activity. For instance, it has been shown to reduce the sensitivity of hepatocytes to interferon. It is believed that the HBV genome integrates into the host interferon consensus sequence, thereby altering the host cellular response to interferon (Thomas et al., 1986) . Both these mechanisms are unlikely to play a role in the blocking of y-interferon-induced class II antigen expression by MHV-4. MHV-4 is a positive polarity RNA virus that completes its replication cycle entirely within the cytoplasm (Wilhelmsen et al., 1981) . Therefore, it is difficult to envision a direct effect by this RNA virus at the DNA level to block the induction of class II-specific genes.",

The blocking of class II antigen expression may also explain the absence of late immune-mediated demyelinating disease in mice infected with MHV-4 (Knobler et al., 1985) . In contrast, in the Lewis strain of rat, MHV-4 has been demonstrated to induce class II antigens on astrocytes and is associated with a late-onset immune-mediated demyelinating disease (Massa et al., 1986 (Massa et al., , 1987 . The mechanism by which these divergent effects on MHC class II induction occur, following exposure to MHV-4 in the rat as compared to the mouse, is unknown at the present time and is an area of further investigation.",
