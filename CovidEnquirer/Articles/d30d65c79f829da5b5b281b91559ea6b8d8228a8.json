The SHFV 3 (+) non-coding region (NCR) is 76 nts in length and forms a stem loop (SL) structure that was confirmed by ribonuclease structure probing. Two cell proteins, p56 and p42, bound specifically to a probe consisting of the SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA. The 3 (+)NCR RNAs of two additional members of the arterivirus genus specifically interacted with two cell proteins of the same size. p56 was identified as polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and p42 was identified as fructose bisphosphate aldolase A. PTB binding sites were mapped to a terminal loop and to a bulged region of the SHFV 3 SL structure. Deletion of either of the PTB binding sites in the viral RNA significantly reduced PTB binding activity, suggesting that both sites are required for efficient binding of this protein.",

The families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae and Roniviridae make up the order Nidovirales. The arterivirus genome is a polycistronic, single-stranded RNA of positive polarity with a 5 type I cap (Sagripanti et al., 1986) , and a 3 poly(A) tract (Brinton et al., 1986; Contag et al., 1986; Sagripanti, 1985; van Berlo et al., 1982) . Arterivirus genomes range in length from 12.7 to 15.7 kb with SHFV being the longest (accession numbers: EAV, NC002532; LDV, NC002534; PRRSV, NC001961; SHFV, NC003092). The viral non-structural genes are encoded by ORF1a/ORF1b, located at the 5 end of the genome and are translated from the genomic RNA. The structural genes are encoded at the 3 end of the genome and are expressed from a nested set of 3 and 5 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs that are generated by a discontinuous transcription process (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995; van Marle et al., 1999; Snijder and Meulenberg, 2001) . The 5 NCRs of the various arterivirus genomic and subgenomic RNAs range in length from 156 to 212 nts, while the 3 NCRs vary from 62 to 150 nts. The lengths of the SHFV 5 and 3 NCRs are 209 and 76 nts, respectively.",

For MHV, a bulged secondary structure located within the 3 NCR adjacent to the nucleocapsid (N) gene stop codon was demonstrated to be required for viral replication (Hsue and Masters, 1997; Hsue et al., 2000) . The 3 side of the bottom portion of this structure was subsequently shown to form a pseudoknot with another 3 NCR SL located downstream (Goebel et al., 2004) . These two structures were found to be mutually exclusive and could potentially function as a molecular switch during viral replication. In the bovine coronavirus (BCV) genome, a pseudoknot was also reported to form immediately downstream of a SL similar to the one reported in the MHV 3 NCR and this tertiary interaction was required for coronavirus defective genome replication (Williams et al., 1999) . For the arterivirus, PRRSV, a SL was predicted near the 5 end of ORF7 and some evidence suggested that nucleotides within the top loop of this structure formed a tertiary interaction (kissing interaction) with nucleotides in the top loop of a predicted SL in the 3 NCR (Verheije et al., 2002) .",

The gels were analyzed using the FUJI Bio Imaging Analyzer. The locations of the RNA-protein complex and free probe are indicated by arrows. weak (42 kDa) protein band were detected with MA104 S100 cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 1C) . No bands were detected when the cell extract was omitted (Fig. 1C , lane 1). Two proteins with the same molecular masses (56 and 42 kDa) were also detected in the SHFV-infected extract suggesting that the two proteins that make up the single RPC are cellular, not viral proteins (Fig. 1C, lane 3) .",

This hypothesis further suggests that the cell proteins involved would be ones that are evolutionarily conserved among different mammalian species. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that the host range of individual arteriviruses is restricted at the level of virus attachment and that a single productive replication cycle occurs after transfection of viral genomic RNA into cells from a non-permissive host (Inada et al., 1993; Meulenberg et al., 1998; Kreutz, 1998) . To determine whether other arterivirus 3 (+)NCR RNAs show cell protein binding patterns similar to that of the SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA, UV-induced cross-linking assays were performed with these RNAs. The initial assays were done with either 32 P-labeled EAV 3 (+)NCR RNA or PRRSV 3 (+)NCR RNA and MA104 S100 extracts in the presence of 600 ng of non-specific competitor. Four proteins with similar molecular masses (85, 77, 56 and 42 kDa) were detected by the SHFV, EAV, and PRRSV 3 (+)NCR RNAs (Fig. 1D) . While the 85 kDa protein appeared to bind the EAV and PRRSV RNAs more efficiently than the SHFV RNA, the other three proteins appeared to bind all three of the viral 3 RNAs with similar efficiency. When 1 g of non-specific competitor was used, the 56 and 42 kDa proteins, but not the 85 and 77 kDa proteins, were detected (data not shown). The EAV and PRRSV RNAs used in these assays did not contain a poly (A) tract.",

Thermodynamic analysis of the SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA predicted a structure consisting of a large 3 SL followed by a small SL (Fig. 3B) . To determine if the predicted structure of the SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA was consistent with the structure formed by this RNA in solution, 3 NCRpl RNA, consisting of the 3 (+)NCR sequence plus an additional 43 3 nts from the plasmid, was used as the template for primer extension structure probing. The presence or absence of the additional 3 nucleotides did not change the Mfold-predicted secondary structure of the SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA. 3 NCRpl RNA and primer P11, which was complementary to 3 nts \u221226 to \u221242 (Fig. 3B) , were annealed. The 3 NCRpl RNA was first partially digested with one of three single-strand specific ribonucleases and then subjected to reverse transcription.

To gain a further understanding of the protein recognition elements in the SHFV 3 (+)NCR, a deletion/mutation strategy was used. Mutations were designed based on the structural information obtained so that they caused only local or minimal perturbations of the structure of the 3 (+)NCR RNA. Mfold analyses were done to predict the effect of each mutation on the SL structure (Fig. 4A) . In RNA-E, the top loop was mutated (5 UCCCU3 was replaced by 5 AAA3 ). Part of the large 3 internal loop sequence (nts 20-23, 5 AACU3 ) was deleted in RNA-F. RNA-G contained a deletion of nts 23-26 and nts 44-48 (5 ACUA3 and 5 AUUAA3 , respectively). This deletion was thermodynamically predicted to change the sequence of the top loop from 5 UCCCU3 to 5 CUA3 , to change the bulge sequence in the top portion of the SL and to stabilize the stem below this bulge by removing the internal loop. UV-induced cross-linking assays indicated that RNA-E bound p56 much less efficiently than the wildtype 3 NCR RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 3) . Reduced binding of p56 to RNA-F was also observed (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and p56 binding to RNA-G was further reduced (Fig. 4B, lane 5) . p42 binding to the RNA-E and RNA-F but not to RNA-G was detected. These data suggest that both the top loop sequence and the sequence of the internal loop in the upper part of the stem are needed for efficient binding of p56. However, even with both of these sites eliminated, a low amount of residual p56 binding was detected.",

A mock column, that contained no RNA linked to the matrix, was also prepared. An S100 cytoplasmic extract prepared from MA104 cells was first incubated with a mixture of various non-specific competitor RNAs and then sequentially passed over an RNA affinity column three times. After washing the column, bound proteins were eluted, concentrated and exchanged into storage buffer as described in Sec-tion 2. Aliquots of the 0.2 M wash and 3 M eluate fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Gold-Blot (Fig. 5A) . Two protein bands with estimated molecular masses of about 56 kDa and a single protein band of about 42 kDa were consistently detected in samples that also contained bands of the same sizes in UV-induced cross-linking assays (Fig. 5B) . The protein purification protocol was repeated several times with similar results. The binding activity of p42 in the 3 M eluate was comparable to that of p56 (Fig. 5B, lane 3) even though the relative amount of p42 in the 3 M eluate was less than that of p56, as indicated by GoldBlot staining (Fig. 5A, lane 2) , suggesting that naturally occurring competitors that affect the relative binding activity of p42 to the viral 3 RNA in the unfractionated cell extract may have been eliminated during the purification process. No viral RNA binding activity was detected in the eluate from the mock column (data not shown). ",

The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and selected peptides were sequenced by automated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a Thermo-Finnigan LCQ Classic quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer Lee, 1997, 1998; Swiderek et al., 1998) . Sequences were obtained for eight peptides derived from the top p56 band, for seven peptides from the bottom p56 band, and for eight peptides from p42 (Fig. 5C ). The peptide sequences obtained from both of the p56 bands showed 100% identity with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein. Three isoforms of human PTB with predicted molecular masses of 59 kDa (PTB1/hnRNP I) (Gil et al., 1991) , 57.2 kDa (PTB2) (Patton et al., 1991) and 42.8 kDa (PTB3) (Ghetti et al., 1992) are produced by alternative pre-mRNA splicing. PTB1 contains 26 additional amino acids and PTB2 contains 19 additional amino acids not present in PTB3. Since none of the peptides analyzed contained sequences that were unique to PTB1 or PTB2, the identity of the isoforms in the p56 doublet could not be confirmed. However, PTB1 and PTB2 are the closest in size to the two proteins that were purified. The sequences obtained from the p42 band showed 100% identity with fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase A. Three isoforms of aldolase (A, B and C) have been previously identified and are expressed from separate genes on three different chromosomes (16, 9 and 17, respectively) . The three aldolase isoforms are identical in size and their sequences are highly conserved (70-82% identical) .",

In these assays, a constant amount of 32 P-labeled SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA and increasing amounts of either purified recombinant His-PTB (Fig. 7B ) or aldolase (Fig. 7E) were used and the amount of RPCs that formed was quantified. The minimum amount of protein needed to observe an RNA mobility shift was determined in preliminary experiments. The lowest concentration of aldolase required was 24.8 nM, while that for His-PTB was 2.5 nM. Because the His-PTB used was not purified to homogeneity, the concentrations for this protein were estimates. The relative amounts of the RPCs and free probe were measured and the values obtained from at least three experiments were averaged. A theoretical saturation binding curve was generated by plotting the percent of bound SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA versus the concentration of either recombinant His-PTB (Fig. 7C ) or aldolase (Fig. 7F) . The entire free probe region and all of the RPC band regions were included in the calculations.

The relative K d for the His-PTB-SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA interaction was estimated to be 7 nM, whereas the relative K d for the aldolase-viral RNA interaction was estimated to be 69 nM. The slope of the line in the inset graph for recombinant His-PTB was 1.24, indicating that approximately 1 His-PTB homodimer binds to one SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA molecule.

PTB binding to the MHV 3 (\u2212)NCR RNA was reported to induce a conformational change in this RNA . Further support for an involvement of PTB in MHV RNA replication was provided by the observation that transcription but not translation of MHV DI RNA was inhibited in cells over-expressing a truncated form of PTB (Choi et al., 2002) . Three regions within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome RNA, namely the 5 NCR, a region in the capsid protein coding region, and the X region of the 3 NCR, were reported to bind to PTB (Ali and Siddiqui, 1997; Ito and Lai, 1999; Tsuchinhara et al., 1997) . Zhang et al. (2004) showed that HCV replication was down-regulated by expression of siRNA against PTB. RNA interference studies unfortunately do not provide information about the roles that cellular cofactors play in viral replication cycles. Also, silencing of some cell genes can cause secondary effects on the cell that suppress virus replication indirectly.",

The EAV and PRRSV 3 NCRs were shown to bind a 56 and 42 kDa MA104 cell protein in UV-induced cross-linking assays and specific competition was observed when they were used as competitors in a competition gel mobility shift assay with an SHFV 3 (+)NCR RNA probe. Although not identical, the predicted secondary structures of other arterivirus 3 NCR RNAs consist of a 3 SL with internal loop or bulge regions along the stem. In each case, pyrimidines are present in the top loop of the 3 SL and on the 3 side of the stem in an internal loop or bulge located near the top of the stem. RNA structure probing analyses have not yet been reported for any of the other arterivirus 3 NCR RNAs. Verheije et al. (2002) reported a tertiary (kissing) interaction between the top loops of a predicted SL located near the 5 end of the PRRSV ORF7 (54 nts from the start codon) and a predicted SL structure within the PRRSV 3 (+)NCR. It is not yet known whether a similar tertiary interaction forms between the SL in the 3 NCR and an upstream SL structure in the SHFV genomic RNA. Possible roles of PTB and aldolase binding to the arterivirus 3 NCR RNA during the virus replication cycle are presently not known. The data reported here suggest that these two proteins could compete for an overlapping binding site and this competition may be functionally relevant.",
