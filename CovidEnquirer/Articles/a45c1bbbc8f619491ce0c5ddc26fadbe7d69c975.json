Mean (SD) AUC PCR log10 viral load was 4.40 (0.91) in placebo and 4.64 (0.88) in paracetamol; difference was \u22120.24, 95% CI: \u22120.78 to 0.29, P = 0.36. In all participants there were no differences in symptom scores, temperature, time to resolution of illness and health status, with no interaction between randomized treatment and whether influenza was detected by PCR. Conclusion: Regular paracetamol had no effect on viral shedding, temperature or clinical symptoms in patients with PCR-confirmed influenza. There remains an insufficient evidence base for paracetamol use in influenza infection. Clinical trial registration: ACTRN12611000497909 at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.",

A meta-analysis of the effect of anti-pyretic drug therapy in animal models of influenza infection found an increased risk of mortality, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% CI: 1.04-1.73). 9 In humans paracetamol prolongs infection in varicella zoster, 10 malaria 11 and rhinovirus, 12 and impairs immune responses. 12, 13 There have been no previous randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trials of the effect of antipyretic therapy on human influenza infection.",

Temperatures within the human febrile range enhance the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cytokines such as interferon (IFN). 14, 15 Paracetamol inhibits polymorphonuclear leucocyte function in vitro 16, 17 with this effect augmented at human febrile temperatures. 18 Prophylactic paracetamol at the time of vaccination impairs the humoral immune response and opsonophagocytic activity in infants, apparently independent of an effect on fever. 19 Human-tropic influenza viruses replicate in the upper respiratory tract at 33-37\u00b0C. Most naturally occurring influenza A strains that infect humans are temperature sensitive, with inhibition of replication at temperatures within the physiological febrile range of 38-41\u00b0C. 20, 21 The degree of temperature sensitivity is one of the characteristics that determine virulence. 22 This trial investigates the effects of paracetamol on viral shedding and clinical symptoms in adults with community-acquired influenza infection. We hypothesized that regular administration of paracetamol during confirmed influenza infection is associated with prolonged viral shedding, worse symptoms, and prolonged illness duration.",

            "text": "There are a number of alternative explanations for our finding of no difference between randomized groups apart from that, in fact, paracetamol does not affect influenza outcomes. The study did not recruit 80 PCR-confirmed cases despite screening with a rapid antigen testing kit with a reported diagnostic specificity of 96-100% for both influenza A and B. 23 All Baseline pernasal samples contained human RNA, indicating that this lower than expected result was unlikely to be due to poor sampling technique. It is possible that the specificity of the rapid antigen test was reduced in this study due to cross reactivity with other respiratory viruses. 23 The lower than anticipated number of PCR-positive influenza cases might be expected to reduce statistical power to detect differences, but the SD of the primary outcome variable was substantially less than anticipated from past research. The CI for the difference excluded the difference we expected to detect, that is half the magnitude of that seen with anti-viral treatment of influenza, 27 but it may be that a smaller difference in the primary outcome variable is still clinically relevant. In terms of the clinical outcome variables, paracetamol did not have any significant anti-pyretic effect whether measured as daily maximum, daily mean or AUC of temperature over 48 h. This may be due in part to the modest febrile response in the participants, the mean maximum temperature on Day 1 in the influenza PCR-positive group was 38.1\u00b0C, falling to 37.4\u00b0C by Day 2. Due to its lack of anti-pyretic efficacy in our sample, we were unable to test our hypothesis that the suppression of fever with paracetamol in influenza infection may be harmful.",

There are no previous studies of paracetamol in proven influenza infection in adults or children. We have found two studies of paracetamol in adults with upper respiratory tract infections. One study reported a non-significant 0.43\u00b0C reduction in temperature with regular paracetamol compared with placebo in presumed nonbacterial upper respiratory tract infections. 30 The other study compared a single 1000-mg dose of paracetamol with placebo in acutely febrile adults with upper respiratory tract symptoms and reported a significant reduction in temperature of 1.08\u00b0C. 31 In summary, this study has found that regular administration of paracetamol had no effect on viral shedding, temperature, symptoms or illness duration in patients with PCR-confirmed influenza infection or influenza-like illness that were also treated with oseltamivir. It is a priority to undertake further studies to ascertain the risk-benefit profile of the routine use of paracetamol alone in the treatment of presumed or PCR-confirmed influenza infection in otherwise healthy adults in the community.",
