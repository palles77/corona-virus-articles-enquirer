Vestibular ataxia occurs when damage or disease affects the vestibular system within the inner ear. Motor activity is not initiated but is refined and coordinated via the vestibular system by controlling muscles used to maintain head position, eye movement, and equilibrium. Dysfunction results in loss of balance; animals often list or fall to one side and may have head tilt. Proprioceptive ataxia is caused by spinal disease, which will result in proprioceptive deficits that can be localized to the affected region of the spinal column. Trauma, intervertebral disk disease, and tumors arising within or compressing the spinal cord or nerves should be considered. 35 ",

As with paresis and ataxia, the most common cause of seizures is hypoglycemia secondary to insulinoma. Prolonged seizure activity can also result in hypoglycemia. Thus it is important to monitor blood glucose concentration long-term in patients that present with low blood glucose during or shortly after seizure activity. Other potential causes of seizures include toxin ingestion; CNS infection, inflammation, trauma, or neoplasia; and metabolic disturbances such as hepatic or renal failure. Idiopathic epilepsy has not been reported in ferrets.",

            "text": "Ferrets can be infected with Aleutian disease virus (ADV), a parvovirus that infects mink and ferrets (see Chapter 5) . The virus is shed in saliva, urine, and feces; infection occurs by inhalation or ingestion. Clinical signs vary from mild incoordination to posterior ataxia, ascending paresis, persistent tremors, and quadriplegia. 43, 46 In one outbreak, clinical signs developed as soon as 24 hours or as long as 90 days after exposure. 46 The most significant biochemical abnormality is a hypergammaglobulinemia, with serum gamma globulin concentrations increased to greater than 20% of the total serum protein concentration. However, not all affected ferrets have high gamma globulin concentrations. 43, 48 Histopathologic changes involving the brain and spinal cord include perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and sometimes plasma cells, nonsuppurative meningitis, astrocytosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, and focal malacia. 43, 48 If you suspect Aleutian disease in a ferret, submit samples for testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or counterimmunoelectrophoresis (see Chapter 5) . Tentative diagnosis is based on a positive result of ADV testing, a high gamma globulin concentration, and the presence of compatible clinical signs. Disease is confirmed at necropsy in suspected ferrets by demonstration of the presence of lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrates on histologic examination of tissue samples. Some infected ferrets may be asymptomatic but remain persistently infected, or the disease may be self-limiting and nonpersistent. 48 The overall incidence of Aleutian disease in ferrets appears to be low; in one serologic study of 446 ferrets, the incidence of seropositive animals was 8.5%. 48 Treatment consists of supportive care and isolation of suspected animals from unaffected ferrets.",

Depending on location, these tumors may be amenable to surgical resection; however, the one reported case of recurrence and metastasis of a chordoma in a ferret was that of a cervical chordoma that had been surgically excised. 51 In the tail, chordomas appear as lobulated, firm, nonencapsulated, ulcerated masses at or near the last caudal vertebra. Microscopically, these tumors consist of lobules of physaliphorous cells with areas of well-differentiated bone or cartilage throughout. 8, 23, 51 Chondrosarcoma of the tail has also been described in ferrets. 22, 29 Clinical and morphologic descriptions are almost identical to those of chordoma. Differentiation must be made on the basis of immunohistochemical staining, with positive uptake of low-molecular-weight cytokeratin occurring in chordoma but not in chondrosarcoma. 8, 23 In ferrets with any distal tail mass, amputate several vertebrae proximal to the lesion. In cases of chordoma and chondrosarcoma, this is considered curative. Recurrence has not been reported. Lymphoma T-cell lymphoma localized to the spine was identified in a ferret presenting with an acute onset of hindlimb paresis, proprioceptive deficits, diminished withdrawal responses, and an atonic bladder. Leukocytosis and lymphocytosis were present, and lysis of the vertebral body was evident radiographically. A mass associated with the soft tissues of the spine was identified by CT scan and ultrasonography. Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the mass confirmed lymphoma. The ferret did not respond to immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone and deteriorated before radiation therapy was initiated. 21",

Although these are benign neoplasms, clinical signs are related to physical displacement or compression of normal structures. 25, 26, 29, 44 Obtain radiographs of any bony swelling to evaluate the extent of the lesion and the bone of origin. Biopsy may be difficult without surgical removal of the mass because of the extreme density of the tumor. The Jamshidi needle biopsy technique has been described. 39 Histopathologic evaluation usually reveals compact lamellar bone, bony trabeculae, and mild to moderate osteoblastic and hematologic activity. 25, 26, 44 Surgical removal is the treatment of choice and is usually curative if excision is complete. 26",

One author (NA) has seen WBC counts over 100,000 with this disease. The WBC count may also be normal at initial presentation but may then increase dramatically during the course of the disease. Mild to moderate anemia is also commonly present and is usually nonregenerative. Biochemical abnormalities reported with this disease are mild to moderate increases in concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and glucose and mild hypoalbuminemia. Interestingly, increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatine kinase (CK) concentrations are not associated with this disease. 18, 40 Gross pathologic changes at necropsy may be absent or may include esophageal dilation, red and white mottling of the esophagus, and white streaks in the heart, diaphragm, and intracostal muscles. Atrophy of the limb musculature and also the tongue and diaphragm is reported. 18, 40 Histopathologic lesions are moderate to severe areas of suppurative pyogranulomatous inflammation, most commonly in the skeletal muscle, esophagus, and heart but also identified in smooth muscle tunics and the submucosa of the stomach, small intestine, and urinary bladder. This profound inflammation occurs in the absence of any infectious or inciting agent. Inflammation is most commonly seen in the muscular tunics but also involves the submucosal and serosal tunics in some cases and frequently extends into the surrounding fascia and adipose tissue. Within inflamed foci, some small arteries, veins, and capillaries also have endothelial cell hypertrophy, neutrophil margination, and perivascular edema or fibrin deposition. 18 Suspect myofasciitis in a recumbent ferret with unresponsive or cyclic pyrexia, muscle pain or sensitivity to touch, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and anorexia. Confirm the diagnosis antemortem with skeletal muscle biopsy from a hind limb. For necropsy diagnosis, be sure to include esophageal samples among those to be examined histologically. Treatment is often unrewarding, although some authors have reported success with aggressive supportive care along with the use of immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q12h for 3 months or longer) and cyclophosphamide (10 mg/kg on days 1 and 14, then every 4 weeks for 3 months or longer) along with chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg PO q12h for 6-8 weeks). Aggressive supportive care can be prolonged (several weeks) and must include fluid therapy and nutritional supplementation; it should also include GI protectants and fever control. 40 The author (NA) has treated some ferrets successfully with this protocol.",
