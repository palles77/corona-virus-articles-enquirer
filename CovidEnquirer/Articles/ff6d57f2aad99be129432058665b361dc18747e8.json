In it, the effects of two groups of mixed lymphocyte cultures and the supernatant fluids of these cultures were tested on C3H macrophages. First, equal numbers (0.5 \u00d7 l0 s) of PRI and C3H lymphocytes were mixed and added to C3H macrophages; than 10% supernatant fluids of the MLC were added to another pair of C3H macrophage cultures. Next, to test the possible transfer of susceptibility from the PRI to the C3H lymphocytes, spleen cells from the congenic, histocompatible but susceptible C3Hss strain were mixed with C3H lymphocytes, and this MLC was added to C3H macrophages. Finally, the supernatant fluid from the latter MLC was added to C3H macrophages. The C3H macrophages in each group were then infected with varying amounts of MHV-PRI. Table I shows that the virus-destroyed macrophages at 100-fold greater dilution with the MLC fluid and cells than with C3H macrophages alone. The C3Hss MLC and supernatant fluid did not increase susceptibility. In the cultures in which macrophages were destroyed, some of these cells showed intensive granulation within a day, became rounded up, and fell into the culture medium. This process increased over time until cell death was complete (Figs. 1).",

The MLC experiments, on the other hand, suggested that the susceptibility of the macrophages was altered by a factor unrelated to susceptibility per se. To test this further, a preparation of supernatant fluid was made from mixtures of spleen cells of C3H and DBA, C3H and C57 black, and C3H and PRI mice. The effects of virus on C3H macrophages treated with these mixtures was then compared with The negative control, i.e. cells treated with fluid from C3H-C3Hss interaction, did not change in susceptibility. These results seem to add further evidence that susceptibility cannot be directly transferred. Viral Assay In Vivo and In Vitro. Previous work with the mouse macrophage system has shown that when very high multiplicities of MHV-PRI virus (i.e. virus adapted to PRI mice) were inoculated onto cultures of C3H-resistant macrophages, there emerged in some of the cultures a new virus that was adapted to the C3H cells, MHV-C3H (5). Thus, it was necessary to ascertain that the experiments did not simply reflect a heightened adaption of the virus to new host cells. This was tested by the following experiments:",

It was the establishment of these two lines of mice which allowed us to differentiate between a hypothesis of conversion, presumed to be like that of transformation (7), and a change in susceptibility brought about by a mixed lymphocyte reaction. In 1962 when the original work on conversion was reported, there was little knowledge of lymphokines and their effect on macrophages. J. H. Huang, in unpublished experiments carried out in our laboratory in 1965, showed that increased susceptibility of resistant macrophage cultures was readily induced by the addition of \"floating\" cells (probably lymphocytes) to the fresh cultures of the resistant macrophages, which contained lymphocytes of another allogeneic type. It was supposed that the virus might be growing in the lymphocytes from the susceptible mice and attaining sufficient titer to destroy the macrophages. This hypothesis could not be ruled out until the congenic strains, C3H (C3Hrr) and C3Hss, had been established.",

Presumably, very high titers of the susceptibility factor are released in the mice in vivo, but the amounts produced in tissue culture where lymphocytes are few are insufficient to confer susceptibility.
