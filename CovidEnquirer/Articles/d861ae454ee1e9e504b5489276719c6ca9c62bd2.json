The population is generally susceptible to this coronavirus, and the elderly and those with certain underlying diseases are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, including hypertension and diabetes [1, 2] . It was reported that the overall proportion of diabetes in COVID-19 was from 5.3% to 20% [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Due to compromised innate immune response, diabetic patients exist increased susceptibility and enhanced disease severity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, COVID-19 with diabetes has much more potential to progress rapidly with acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, which may be eventually followed by multiple organ failure.",

At this stage, the largest epidemiological investigation in China indicated that the mortality of COVID-19 with diabetes up to 7.3% (80/1102), which is dramatically higher than that of the patients without any comorbidities (0.9%, 133/15,536) [6] . Infection of SARS-CoV-2 with diabetes might trigger stress condition and increased secretion of hyperglycemic hormones, such as glucocorticoid and catecholamines, which results in elevated blood glucose, abnormal glucose variability and diabetic complications. Moreover, in order to raise admission capacity of local hospitals, huge amount of Chinese medical personnels went to Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, to battle against this epidemic. However, compared with professional endocrinologists, most of front-line respirologists and critical care specialists in Wuhan may be lack of the concern of blood glucose and insufficient of clinical experience of diabetes therapy, which may lead to blood glucose fluctuation for patients with diabetes. Therefore, timely and standardized blood glucose management for diabetic patients with COVID-19 is urgently needed.",
