A controlled randomized blind design with 800 lactating dairy pregnant cows diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) between Days 35 and 57 of gestation from one dairy farm were included. The cows were randomly divided according to detection of allantochorion membrane (FMS group; n \u00bc 264), detection of amniotic sac (ASP group; n \u00bc 266), and TRUS (control [CON] group; n \u00bc 270). TRUS was considered as the criterion standard method of comparison. The entire PRP was performed by one experienced veterinarian. Then, all the cows were reexamined only by TRUS between 2 and 4 weeks later by two independent veterinarians to assess PRL. The calving rate one (number of cows calved divided by the number of cows initially pregnant) and calving rate two (number of cows calved divided by the number of cows pregnant at reexamination) for each group was calculated. All abortions and stillborns were necropsied, and calves alive were followed for 5 days. The overall initial PRL (between initial pregnant cows and reexamination) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 7.4% (19/258), 8.8% (23/262), and 9.2% (24/260), respectively (P \u00bc 0.75). The overall late PRL (between reexamination and calving) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 4.2% (9/213), 5.7% (12/209), and 4.2% (9/216), respectively (P \u00bc 0.71).

To accomplish this purpose, cows must become pregnant within 85 to 145 days after calving. Two capital phases in dairy reproductive management are not only breeding cows after the voluntary waiting period but also having an early pregnancy diagnosis [2] . Diagnosis of nonpregnancy before the second probable estrus permits for an earlier management decision [3, 4] and reduces the days a cow is not pregnant [5] , which leads to shortened and more profitable calving intervals [6] .",

            "text": "In current cattle practices, two procedures permit immediate diagnosis of pregnancy: per rectum palpation (PRP) and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) [2] [3] [4] . Pregnancy diagnosis by PRP is the most frequent procedure used by veterinarians around the world [3, [7] [8] [9] , although other techniques of pregnancy diagnosis are available [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] . In USA, according to the last report of National Animal Health Monitoring System [9] , 93% of the Dairy Operations performed pregnancy diagnosis and 86% of these operations used PRP to perform pregnancy diagnosis. Almost 90% of the operations used a veterinarian to perform these pregnancy exams. No differences among small (<100 heads), medium (101-499), and large (>500) dairy operations in the use of PRP were detected. More than one-fourth of operations (27.4%) routinely used TRUS with PRP to assess pregnancy status. Moreover, PRP was used to diagnose pregnancy on 96.3% of operations in the west region, compared with 84.8% in the east region of the country. Per rectum palpation continues to be the most used technique for pregnancy diagnosis for practitioners. The use of PRP is based on multiple reasons such as not requiring equipment or laboratory and the fact that the results are fast, permitting an immediate decision. It is an accurate technique after Day 35 of breeding when performed by trained veterinarians; it permits aging the pregnancy and can assess the viability of the fetus. In addition, it is cheaper when compared with other techniques, gives additional information about other internal organs, and permits evaluation of body condition score, cleaning score, leg conformation, and udder [3, 4, 8, 14, 15] . Per rectum palpation for pregnancy diagnosis is based on the detection of at least one of the four positive signs of pregnancy such as allantochorion, amniotic vesicle, placentomes, and/or fetus [3] . During earlier stages of gestation detection, either the amniotic sac or allantochorion membrane (also known as fetal membrane slip technique; FMS) is used as a positive sign of pregnancy [16, 17] . The size of the amniotic sac in relationship to the fingers or size of hand of the veterinarian permits one to estimate the age of pregnancy during the first 65 to 70 days of pregnancy [18] . The diagnosis of twin pregnancies requires the assessment of the number of amniotic sacs [3, 8, 19] . Interestingly, until recently, few studies were designed to answer two essential aspects of PRP such as safety and accuracy [4, 10, 15, [20] [21] [22] .",

            "text": "In regards to the safety aspects for the conceptus by PRP, contradictory proofs were published [4, 21] . Investigators in some studies suggested that PRP had little or no effect on pregnancy loss (PRL) [23] [24] [25] . Conversely, investigators in other reports suggested that PRP during early gestation increased PRL [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . However, all these studies had important limitations in their design as previously reported [4] . In recent controlled studies, it was shown that the detection of either the allantochorion membrane or amniotic sac by PRP through the embryonic period did not increase the PRL when reexamined by TRUS in the course of the fetal period [4, 21, 22] . However, in those trials, no information about calving rates or the clinical status of the newborn calves was reported. In a number of investigations, initially from the United States, then from Germany and later on other locations, an association between amniotic sac palpation (ASP) during the embryonic period for pregnancy diagnosis (till Day 45 of gestation) [32] , especially between 36 and 42 days, an increased risk of atresia coli/jejuni in newborn calves [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] was observed. In atresia coli/jejuni, a section of the large bowel or jejuni is absent, resulting in a blind ending intestinal tube. This clinical congenital condition is lethal, and surgical correction is the only treatment available [39] [40] [41] [42] . Atresia coli/jejuni has been reported in different countries and reported in more than 10 breeds of cattle, with a marked preponderance in Holstein calves [43] . Based on those findings, some sources have recommended avoiding PRP of the uterus during the first 45 days of gestation [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Inspite of this, intestinal atresia was also reported to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in Jersey and Swedish Highland cattle [44, 45] . Intestinal atresia could develop either from imperfect canalization of the gut or from insufficient blood supply to the affected portion of the intestine [46] . This last mechanism was suggested to be caused by ASP [36, 43] . Nonetheless, the root of atresia coli/ jejuni remains polemic and not completely understood [36, 43, 46] . In a recent controlled randomized blind experiment performed in two dairy operations with 680 pregnant cows to evaluate the effect of ASP during the embryonic period, no differences on PRL, calving rates, and abnormalities of newborns were detected [47] . Remarkably, two calves were born with atresia coli only in the CON group (which only received TRUS throughout gestation). This is strong evidence against the harmful effect of ASP for pregnancy diagnosis on abnormalities in newborn calves. Also, in the author's practice, the use of ASP for early pregnancy diagnosis is not routinely used. Conversely, calves with atresia coli/jejuni were diagnosed among newborn calves from females that underwent PRP only by the detection of allantochorion membrane, either during the embryonic period or fetal period, females diagnosed as pregnant using only TRUS as well as females that never were submitted to PRP throughout gestation (Romano, unpublished data) . These observational findings powerfully suggest that ASP during early gestation was not associated with this pathological condition. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no controlled studies were available with the initial pregnancy diagnosis by ASP performed during the early fetal period (!46-60 days) on PRL, calving rates, and abnormalities in newborn calves. Moreover, no evidence was published about the use of allantochorion membrane detection on calving rates or abnormalities in newborn calves. TRUS permits an immediate, early, and accurate method for early pregnancy diagnosis and has been reported as not affecting embryo or fetus viability or producing abnormalities in the newborn [2, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Therefore, with the assistance of TRUS, one could potentially reduce or eliminate the PRP of the uterus, permitting a better experimental design to create a CON group of contemporaneous pregnant females to study the effect of allantochorion membrane or amniotic sac detection by PRP to investigate these two techniques on PRL, calving rates, and abnormalities in newborn calves.",

Cows were diagnosed as pregnant based on the presence of a viable embryo by TRUS between Days 35 to 60 after breeding and [2] then were divided randomly into three groups: CON group, allantochorion membrane detection by PRP (FMS group), and amniotic sac palpation PRP (ASP group). All the initial TRUS examinations were performed by the same veterinarian in the morning, who used a portable ultrasound machine equipped with a 7.5-MHz linear transducer as previously described [21] . The CON group did not receive any PRP of the uterus. The FMS group was submitted to PRP to detect the allantochorion membrane by compression of the pregnant uterine horn and allowing the chorioallantoic membrane to slip between the fingers [4] . Amniotic sac palpation consists of the compression of the pregnant uterine horn and detection of the amniotic sac as a small, turgid, slightly oblong, balloon-like structure between the thumb and the fingers [15] . All the initial pregnancy diagnoses were performed only once by a board-certified theriogenologist with over 30 years of bovine practice. In the event that one amniotic sac was found, no attempt was made to look for a second amniotic vesicle; therefore, the possibility of twin pregnancy detection was avoided. In general, the uterine horns were retracted directly or indirectly before this approach was used. No person was allowed to perform PRP or TRUS on the cattle at any time during the experimental period. After submitted to their respective treatments, each female was reevaluated for pregnancy again, in general, 2 to 4 weeks later. These pregnancy reexaminations were performed only by TRUS by two different veterinarians from the initial pregnancy diagnosis who were blind to the treatment of each cow but were aware of this project. All the pregnant females at this stage were followed until calving. A diagnosis of PRL was made when a heartbeat or signs of pregnancy (allantochorion membrane, amniotic sac, conceptus, or placentomes) were not seen by ultrasonography, or signs of conceptus degeneration were observed by TRUS [56] . All abortions, premature, or mature dead calves were submitted to necropsy to determine if abnormalities were present and which type. The necropsies were performed by two veterinarians, different from those of initial examination or reexaminations, who were also blinded to the initial intervention. All calves alive at birth were maintained for observation for 3 to 5 days to detect any type of abnormalities.",

In the design phase of this investigation, a power of 90% was chosen to decrease the probability of discovering \"no difference\" when real differences could exist (reduce potential false negative results); the main goal was to support the null hypothesis \u00bc no difference among treatments when the alternative hypothesis was tested. In multiple independent studies [4, 13, 21, 47] , the designs were constructed to detect differences in PRL between 5% and 10% between groups using an error \u00bc 0.05 and a b error between 0.2 and 0.1 (power 80% or 90%, respectively), and no divergences between PRP and control groups were detected. The proportion of PRL and calving rates for cows subjected to ASP, FMS, or TRUS was compared with the proportion for CON during the two periods by use of chisquared analysis or Fisher's exact test as appropriate [57, 59] . The continuous variables (body condition score, lactation number, and postpartum days at artificial insemination) were analyzed by one way of analysis of variance [58, 59] . Every cow that was missing was not included in the statistical analysis. All data were expressed as mean AE1 standard deviation (range). Values of P 0.05 were considered significant. A software program was used to analyze all data sets [57] .",

PRLs at reexamination between FMS and ASP groups were not different from the CON group. These outcomes were in agreement with earlier controlled studies. However, in those previous reports, either FMS was compared with TRUS [4, 21] or ASP was contrasted with TRUS [15] but, not all these procedures were judged simultaneously. In former, noncontrolled studies, when FMS was compared with ASP between Days 30 and 44 after breeding, a PRL at recheck of 4.8% and 5.1% was reported [60] , and similar results were stated by Studer [61] . In a follow-up study, when ASP was performed between Days 35 and 50 and the females were reexamined at 5 m later, a PRL of 3.6% [62] and 10% [63] was noticed. In a later study, a PRL of 19% between pregnancy diagnoses by ASP performed between Days 30 and 45 and calving was described [30] . In regard to FMS, in multiple noncontrolled studies, the procedure was shown to be deleterious for the conceptus [26] [27] [28] . However, the major limitation in all those earlier studies that reported an association between PRP and PRL was that the source of information was based on observational findings; none of these studies included a CON group of contemporaneous non-PRP group at the same gestational period for comparison. Consequently, it was not possible to differentiate between the spontaneous PRL and the potential effects of the technique of pregnancy diagnosis.",

On the other hand, the amniotic sac, in a singleton, occupies a small part of the pregnant uterine horn that requires thorough examination for its detection, demanding simultaneously gentle and indirect pressure to avoid producing iatrogenic abortion [3, 15, 61] . The percentage of PRL was higher in the late embryonic period compared with the early fetal period and in concordance with preceding investigations [4, 15, 21] . These two periods had higher PRL compared with later periods. This information is critical because the earlier that a female is diagnosed as pregnant, the greater the chance that a pregnant female will have spontaneous PRL unrelated to the technique used for pregnancy diagnosis. Consequently, the detection of a pregnant female during early stages of pregnancy, especially during the late embryonic period or early fetal period, will require obligatory reexamination to avoid maintaining, later on, a nonpregnant female in the production system. In addition, the PRL during early gestation period, in general, will be most likely unnoticed [63, 64] . Finally, grounded from the present findings as well as other studies [56, 65] , diagnosis of a female as pregnant at reexamination does not guarantee that she will calve; therefore, an additional reexamination needs to be included. Pregnancy diagnosis is a dynamic clinical condition; a female could maintain the pregnancy or lose it. On the other hand, nonpregnancy is a static condition that needs assessment to place the female as soon as possible in the reproductive program [21] . PRL varied among farms [21, 28, 56, 61, 64] ; therefore, different policies of pregnancy diagnosis and reexamination need to be established for each dairy operation.",

That means that only one veterinarian performs one examination looking for only one positive sign of pregnancy. This fact could be judged as a limited factor; however, this person has the experience and credentials to be considered as a regular bovine practitioner. On the other hand, the effect of variation among clinicians on PRL as was previously reported was reduced or eliminated by using one trained veterinarian [26] . In previous studies, it seems that a more aggressive approach was used, because pregnant females underwent PRP from more than one person. In addition, multiple techniques were used in the same animal at the same examination, or several techniques were used by more than one person in the same pregnant female [26] [27] [28] [29] . Most of these studies were derived from clinical educating programs that included less experienced people or more rough and extensive assessment of the female genital tract was performed.",

Therefore, based on all these reports, it was expected that when ASP was performed during the high-risk period of pregnancy, between Days 35 and 45, the frequency of atresia coli will be significantly higher compared with FMS or CON groups. It was expected that between four and 11 calves would be diagnosed with atresia coli. However, no calves with atresia coli were detected in 158 cows evaluated. This outcome is in agreement with the findings of a recent study in which ASP was performed in 341 pregnant cows during the late embryonic period ( 45 days); of these, 285 were between Days 35 and 42. No cases of atresia coli were identified [47] . Only two calves with atresia coli were diagnosed in the CON group that involved 337 pregnant cows assessed only by TRUS. The prevalence of this last study was 0.59% for the CON group, and prevalence including all the experimental animals was 0.29% [47] . Therefore, supported by these two studies, there is strong evidence against the deleterious association of ASP during the late embryonic period and atresia coli. Finally, from 26 calves with atresia coli studied, for which history from 11 was available, PRP was performed in 10 females when they were between 55 and 90 days of pregnancy; one cow was not examined at all [40] . In Australia, from 12 calves submitted to necropsy, only one had a record of PRP at 12 weeks after breeding [69] . In Iran, from 68 clinical cases of intestinal atresia, none of the dams were examined via PRP throughout gestation [70] .",

In those noncontrolled reports, no calves with atresia coli were reported from 995 cows examined by ASP after Day 40 [35] , from 103 females examined after Day 43 [36] , from 45 pregnant cows examined between Days 39 and 51 [35] , or from 800 pregnant females assessed after Day 43 [38] . In the present study, the calf was born dead from a Holstein dam examined at Day 51 of pregnancy that was artificially inseminated by a Holstein bull. The prevalence of atresia coli for the ASP was 0.38% (1/266), and the overall prevalence for all the groups was 0.13% (1/800). This prevalence is very low. The present outcomes were in conformity with other reports that pregnancy diagnosis performed after Day 40 corresponded to 359 normal calves and one affected calf (0.3%) or a mean prevalence of 0.76% from a Holstein herd that reported 18 cases of atresia coli from 2367 births (from 1974-1983 ; range between years from 0%-1.55%/y) [67] . In a different study, from the same herd, one calf with atresia coli (0.34%) was detected from 295 normal calves diagnosed from a contemporaneous random mating group [68] . It is necessary to remark that the major limitation in all these previous reports was that the source of information was based on observational findings because none of these studies included a comparison CON group of contemporaneous pregnant females of the same gestational age that did not undergo PRP. Therefore, PRP was a potential confounding factor rather a causative effect because all females underwent PRP.",

There is a need for accurate information supported in evidence-based medicine about the potential harmful effect of PRP on PRL, calving rates, or abnormalities in newborn calves. This knowledge will not only affect the way that the veterinarians practice but also how the owner or manager will perceive the use of this method in his or her reproductive management [4, 47] . Some authors stated previous recommendations avoiding PRP of the uterus to detect the amniotic sac during the first 45 days of gestation [33, [35] [36] [37] [38] 71, 72] . The present findings support the use of either ASP or FMS for pregnancy diagnosis, when performed by a trained veterinarian in a random dairy cattle population, was a safe procedure for the conceptus using three assessment points: at reexamination, at calving, and at evaluation of newborn calves.",
