However, mycoplasmas have also been the sole bacterial isolate in a number of clinical cases of canine respiratory disease, but unfortunately these isolates were not speciated and viral causes of CIRD were not investigated (Kirchner et al., 1990; Jameson et al., 1995; Chandler and Lappin, 2002) . The involvement of M. cynos in CIRD has been noted for some time (Rosendal, 1972 (Rosendal, , 1978 (Rosendal, , 1982 . Evidence for this has been mounting recently, as Chalker et al. (2004) found that M. cynos was the only mycoplasma significantly associated with canine respiratory disease. In addition, dogs entering a re-homing kennel that developed an antibody response to M. cynos were more likely to suffer respiratory disease (Rycroft et al., 2007) . M. cynos has been isolated from dogs with pneumonia (Rosendal, 1972 (Rosendal, , 1978 Chvala et al., 2007) and was particularly abundant in the most necrotic areas of the lung (Chvala et al., 2007) . Furthermore, M. cynos was the only detected agent in a case of severe bronchopneumonia in a litter of young puppies which resulted in the deaths of some puppies, but which was resolved in the surviving littermates after the administration of appropriate antibiotics .",

This study describes the strain typing of 14 M. cynos isolates cultured from trachea and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of six dogs with respiratory disease, from two separate kennels in the United Kingdom. The genetic similarity of the isolates was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Most of the isolates from four dogs housed at a rehoming kennel were genetically similar and some isolates from different dogs were indistinguishable by both PFGE and RAPD. These isolates were cultured from dogs with non-overlapping stays in the kennel, which may indicate maintenance of some strains within kennels. A small number of isolates showed much greater genetic heterogeneity and were genetically distinct from the main group of M. cynos strains. There was also a high degree of similarity of the M. cynos type strain (isolated from a dog with respiratory disease in Denmark in 1971) to at least one of the United Kingdom isolates using PFGE analysis, which may suggest possible conservation of pathogenic strains of M. cynos.",

Agarose plugs were made from a 1:1 mixture of 2% low-melting-point agarose (Biorad) and the cell suspension. Plugs were incubated in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% lauroyl sarcosine, 1 mg/ ml proteinase K) for 48 h at 56 8C. Plugs were washed four times with Tris-EDTA buffer for 30 min at 4 8C. Slices (2 mm) were cut aseptically from plugs and equilibrated in restriction buffer (Promega) for 1 h. Subsequently, restriction digestion was performed by using 30 U of SmaI (Promega) for 16 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragments were resolved on 1% pulsed field certified agarose (Biorad) gels using a CHEF-DRIII system (Biorad) at 6 V/cm, with a running time of 20 h at 14 8C; included angle of 1208; initial pulse time of 4 s; final pulse time of 40 s. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml) for 15 min, destained in distilled water for 1 h and photographed under UV light. A lambda ladder PFGE marker (Sigma) was used for fragment size determination. The Bionumerics package (Applied Maths) was used for gel analysis and dendrograms were produced using the Jaccard Coefficient and unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) cluster analysis.",

The dogs had stayed at the kennels for between 8 and 16 days. This may suggest that there is maintenance of M. cynos strains within a kennel situation. M. cynos can be isolated from the upper respiratory tract of healthy dogs (Chalker et al., 2004) and it is probable that some strains are passed between subsequent dogs, resulting in the survival of these strains. In addition, environmental survival may aid the continued existence of some strains. Although the environmental survival of M. cynos is not known, the environmental survival of other mycoplasma species varies from a week to several months (Nagatomo et al., 2001) and M. cynos can be isolated from the air (Chalker et al., 2004) . Recently it has been shown that biofilm formation is important for persistence of mycoplasmas and may aid environmental survival , it seems feasible that M. cynos may be able to persist in the kennel environment as an adherent biofilm layer.",

            "text": "The M. cynos type strain was isolated from the lung of a dog with CIRD in Denmark in 1971 (Rosendal, 1973) . This M. cynos type strain was indistinguishable by PFGE to isolate 510 from dog B-2 and was more than 68% similar by RAPD analysis to 11 of the M. cynos isolates from both kennels. The high degree of similarity of the type strain to these United Kingdom isolates from 1999 to 2000 suggests a low level of diversity of this organism in CIRD. However, this study also shows that some isolates have a relatively low level of similarity with each other (for example isolates 214, 491 and 492 appear to be dissimilar to the group 1 isolates). Indeed, this study suggests the potential for mixed M. cynos infections, as the same bronchoalveolar lavage sample from dog B-2 yielded M. cynos isolates 492 and 510, which are dissimilar strains. Similarly, the BAL sample from dog A-1 resulted in the culture of the 214 isolate which was dissimilar to the other isolates from this sample. A larger strain typing study of more isolates is required to consolidate these observations. M. cynos was the only CIRD agent detected in two out of the six dogs (dogs B-1 and B-2). Similarly, recently Zeugswetter et al. (2007) described lethal bronchopneumonia in puppies where M. cynos was the only CIRD agent detected from the puppies. Mycoplasmas have been the sole bacterial isolate in a number of other cases of CIRD, but unfortunately these isolates were not speciated (Kirchner et al., 1990; Jameson et al., 1995; Chandler and Lappin, 2002) . However, in the current study, both dogs were on a course of antibiotics preceding the sampling date (dog B-1 cephalosporin; B-2 erythromycin), which may have precluded the isolation of other bacterial agents. Likewise, in the case of Zeugswetter et al. (2007) , the puppies had been treated with amoxicillin prior to isolation of M. cynos from the lung tissue.",
