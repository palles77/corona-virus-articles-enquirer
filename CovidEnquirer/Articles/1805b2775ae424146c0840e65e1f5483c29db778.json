However, when the virus mutates within a susceptible host, the ability of the virus to replicate in macrophages can be enhanced. The mutated forms of FCoV develop in fewer than 5% of cats with FCoV, but this process causes a fatal disease -feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 1 Mutated forms of FCoV that cause FIP are renamed feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).",

Fever, inappetence, lethargy, and jaundice can be observed in cats with either form of FIP. 2 Animals with the wet form of the disease have ascites and/or pleural effusion. Evaluation of these fluids can aid in the diagnosis of FIP, but there is significant overlap in findings associated with FIP and those associated with other causes of effusion. In cats with the dry form of FIP, granulomas form in a variety of organs, making the dry form FIP even more difficult to diagnose.",

Therefore, vaccination against FCoV is ineffective. It is also believed that T-cell immunity directly contributes to clini-cal signs associated with FIPV. Cats with the wet form of FIP mount relatively poor, ineffective T-cell immune responses against FIPV. Whereas animals with the dry form of FIP seem to mount an enhanced T-cell immune response against the virus. This enhanced response prevents formation of effusions, but leads to a more chronic granulomatous response to infection. 3 Very low numbers of FIPV particles are shed in the feces of cats with FIP. Therefore, FIPV is rarely (if ever) transmitted between cats. Although horizontal transmission is not a critical issue, the clinical signs of FIP become severe quickly which necessitates rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease.",

An albumin to globulin ratio <8.0 also occurs in approximately 85% of affected cats. An increased total protein concentration is present in as few as 18% of cats with FIP.

Sensitivity and specificity of these tests vary with the specific test used and the prevalence of FCoV in a population. The sensitivity of these tests ranges from 67 to 100%, and the specificity ranges from 57 to 100%. Most ELISAs are slightly less sensitive but are more specific than IFAs. A titer 1:1600 in an effusion supports a diagnosis of FIP. The absence of antibody in an effusion has a good negative predictive value. 1 Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect specific mutations in the FIPV genome can be performed on serum, effusions, and other body fluids. However, test sensitivity as low as 42% has been reported, because the mutations amplified by the RT-PCR may not be present in the individual cat being tested. The specificity of this test is good (88 to 100%). 6 Immunocytochemistry can be performed on effusions to detect FIPV antigen within cells. However, the sensitivity for this test is relatively low (as low as 57%), because false negative results are likely if the cellularity of the sample is low. Specificity ranges from 71 to 100% for this test.",
