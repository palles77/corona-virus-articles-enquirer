[9] [10] [11] During the past 16 months, Mayo Clinic Proceedings has published reviews of diseases caused by 3 of these emerging pathogens, West Nile virus, 12 the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 13 and avian influenza virus. 14 Efforts to better inform readers about the consequences of emerging infectious diseases continue in this issue of the Proceedings, in which Chiang et al 15 report a study of 14 cases of nosocomial SARS acquired in 3 Taipei hospitals during 2003. Most of the 14 patients, 13 of whom were followed up for at least 8 months, were health care workers, and because few had underlying diseases, all except 1 survived; thus, this study provides some of the best data on the long-term effects of SARS on the lung. The clinical features and natural history of SARS encountered by Chiang et al are similar to those reported in much larger cohorts. 16, 17 All their patients had fever, and most had cough and dyspnea as well; however, 79% had diarrhea, and 64% had myalgias, indicative of the severe systemic immunoinflammatory response to this unique new human infection. 18, 19 Similarly, all their patients had lymphopenia, and most had elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, now well-defined surrogate laboratory markers for patients presenting with SARS. 16, 17 However, Chiang et al also found that patients with a very high C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase level at the outset were far more likely to have progression to a severe stage of disease requiring mechanical ventilatory support, information of value to clinicians who might be called on to manage patients with SARS in the not-too-distant future.",

It is likely that most of these individuals will have recovery of normal lung function. These findings are very similar to the well-documented long-term pulmonary effects of garden-variety acute respiratory distress syndrome, stemming from overwhelming pneumonia, gastric aspiration, near drowning, trauma, pancreatitis, or systemic sepsis, in which most survivors have gratifying recovery of lung function in the early years after the acute episode. [20] [21] [22] Because SARS is such a unique human viral infection and induces such an unusually severe systemic inflammatory response, 18, 19 it will be important to closely follow survivors of severe SARS for considerably longer to be certain that latently expressed progressive pulmonary fibrosis does not occur.",

            "text": "Between the first reports from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that defined SARS as a global threat in March 2003 23,24 and control of the epidemic in Southeast Asia and North America 5 months later, more than 8000 persons in the Republic of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Canada became infected, and 774 (9.6%) died of the infection 8 ; mortality exceeded 50% in patients older than 60 years. 16, 17 Since the last communication on SARS in the Proceedings in April 2004, there have been extraordinary advances in our understanding of the disease in terms of its pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and control: EDITORIAL \u2022 Like many of the emerging human pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi (mice, deer), US Hantavirus (mice), West Nile virus (wild birds), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob prions (cattle, potentially free-ranging cervids), monkeypox virus (exotic African rodents and primates, US prairie dogs), and avian influenza virus A (H5N1) (edible birds), infection by SARS-CoV can legitimately be considered a zoonosis, and wild mammals formed the initial reservoir of the virus-SARS-CoV has been isolated from palm-top civets and raccoon dogs in the live animal markets in southern China, 25 and purveyors of these animals commonly show asymptomatic SARS-CoV seropositivity. 25, 26 The genomic evidence that SARS-CoV is an animal-human recombinant is compelling, [27] [28] [29] [30] and SARS-CoV appears to have had a biologic origin remarkably similar to the human influenza A viruses and human immunodeficiency virus. Although the SARS virus originated in animals and made the leap to humans, once established in the human population, the virus has spread rapidly person-toperson, and the major reservoir of human disease is humans in the early stage of infection, before they have been diagnosed as having the virus and placed in respiratory and barrier isolation. 31 \u2022 Elegant molecular epidemiology has traced the origins of SARS-CoV to Foshan in Guangdong Province, Southern China, from whence it spread to Beijing, then to Hong Kong, and from Hong Kong to Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. 32,33 A 65-year-old Chinese physician who traveled to Hong Kong on March 21, 2003 , where he spent only 1 day, appears to have been the source of SARS-CoV that ultimately resulted in thousands of cases of SARS in 26 countries and 5 continents. 34 \u2022 SARS-CoV is a new human pathogen to most of the world. Studies by the CDC have shown no serologic evidence of past infection in more than 400 specimens from US residents collected long before the SARS epidemic. 35 \u2022 As a new human pathogen, there is, understandably, little if any natural immunity. Virtually all persons who became infected by SARS-CoV became symptomatic, 31 and studies of exposed health care workers show that less than 1% to 2% of those infected experience mild or subclinical infection. 36 \u2022 SARS spreads almost exclusively person-to-person by respiratory droplets, rarely by the airborne route 31 ; the roles of contact or fecal-oral transmission are less clear but probably occur. 16, 37 The puzzling large outbreak in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong was recently traced to virus-laden aerosols generated from sewage, using sophisticated airflow-dynamic studies and computational fluid-zone modeling. 38 However, whereas the outbreak in the Amoy Gardens complex represents distant airborne spread, distant spread is probably rare, as evidenced by the very low risk of infection in patients with no plausible face-to-face exposure to a patient with symptomatic SARS, by the effectiveness of simple isolation measures in hospitals that did not have sophisticated negative-pressure air-controlled rooms with separate roofline exhaust, and by the relatively few secondary cases on commercial airliners. 31, [39] [40] [41] In an investigation of 3 flights in which an airliner transported 1 or more symptomatic infected passengers, 16 laboratory-confirmed cases of secondary SARS were detected on 1 flight, with the greatest risk to other passengers close to the index case (seated within 3 rows, relative risk 3.1); on 1 flight carrying 4 symptomatic infected persons, possible transmission occurred to only 1 other passenger, and no secondary illness was documented on another flight that carried 1 person with early SARS. 39 \u2022 Simple control measures, most importantly the use of a high-quality filtration mask, ideally an N-95-type mask but even a surgical mask, 42 combined with full-barrier precautions in a single room were highly effective in preventing spread to other patients and health care workers where it was most carefully studied, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada. 16, 17, 31, 42 \u2022 Patients with early SARS do not pose a risk to others until they become symptomatic and start to cough, 31 but there is considerable variability in contagiousness, probably based on the quantity of virus in the respiratory secretions 43 and the degree of coughing. Very close proximity to an infected patient who is coughing heavily poses the greatest risk. 16 It appears that most spread of the virus can be linked to \"super spreaders,\" and most infected persons are probably not very contagious. 31, 34, [44] [45] [46] [47] Understandably, the risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV is far higher in the hospital than in the community. 31, 46 \u2022 The mean incubation period of SARS is approximately 6 days 48 (range, 2-10 days) and is considerably longer than that for most other human respiratory viral infections, such as the common cold or influenza A, which permits case-contact investigations and quarantine of exposed contacts before those destined to become infected and contagious can spread the disease to others.",

[68] [69] [70] [71] The measures needed for control of SARS are clear 31, 50, 51 : (1) earliest detection of cases, having at-risk individuals isolated and queried about their face-to-face contacts during the 10 to 14 days before the onset of illness; (2) expeditious contact tracing, with uncompromising home quarantine for all contacts of suspect and proven cases; and (3) stringent isolation of symptomatic suspect and proven cases, focusing most heavily on techniques to prevent droplet and airborne spread (eg, single negative-pressure rooms, ideally with separate roofline exhaust or filtration of outlet air; fit-tested high-filtration mask respirators and a face shield or goggles or a powered air-purifying system for all health care workers and others entering the room of the case, as well as the use of nonsterile gloves and gowns to prevent contact transmission). 50,51 The value of border screening and temperature monitoring of travelers is questionable. 71 The resources needed to control an outbreak in a city or a country are huge. In North America, the Toronto outbreak consisted of 246 documented cases in 4 hospitals. 70 To control SARS in Toronto required home quarantine of more than 23,000 contacts and an informational hotline that handled more than 300,000 calls; the economic cost of the epidemic to the city and the city and provincial govern- ments was estimated at $1.13 billion (Canadian). The longterm psychological impact of SARS on patients, families, and health care workers was also very substantial. [72] [73] [74] \u2022 Efforts are now under way to test candidate SARS vaccines. 75 The national tragedy of September 11, 2001, was followed by the most serious instance of bioterrorism involving the US civilian population in history, the spread of anthrax through the US mail. 7 These events coincided with growing awareness that weaponized smallpox virus almost certainly yet exists in the world, with strong suspicion that the former Soviet Union, 76 as well as countries that have sponsored international terrorism, such as Iran and North Korea, 77,78 retained smallpox virus as a potential weapon. The unthinkable has become plausible: weaponized smallpox virus in the hands of international terrorist groups. As a consequence, the federal government has undertaken major steps to greatly improve emergency preparedness at all levels, especially the capacity to respond to the use of biologic agents such as smallpox or anthrax as weapons against the civilian population as well as our military (Table 2) . 79,80 Billions of dollars have been appropriated to improve the capacity of public health and clinical laboratories to reliably detect infectious agents that might represent biologic weapons; to improve the likelihood that emergency department physicians and all primary care providers could recognize anthrax, smallpox, and other infectious diseases that might denote bioterrorism; to establish and coordinate surveillance programs at the regional, state, and federal levels; and to train more than a million public protection personnel and greatly improve preparedness of the 7000 US hospitals. 81 At my center, we have spent hundreds of person-hours identifying and retrofitting a 35bed patient-care unit for the potential accommodation of patients with smallpox or other highly contagious infections such as SARS or pandemic influenza caused by a new strain. This local effort has focused on air control and negative-pressure isolation rooms, which have the capacity for supporting mechanical ventilation, and developing comprehensive guidelines for health care workers who would staff the unit.",

Most alarmingly, there is growing evidence that person-to-person spread can occur, 87 albeit yet rarely. The epidemic strain further shows high-level resistance to amantadine and rimantadine but is thus far susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir or zanamivir. 14 If the strain acquires recombinant genes that facilitate human infection and person-to-person transmission, pandemic disease could prove more catastrophic than the great H1N1 influenza epidemic of 1918.",

            "text": "Even more concerning has been the challenge of developing an avian influenza vaccine. Current influenza vaccines are unlikely to provide any protection against the new H5N1 avian strain. The standard method for manufacturing influenza vaccines, growing the vaccine strain in chicken embryos, does not work because the avian A (H5N1) strain is so virulent that it kills the embryo before there is sufficient virus to harvest. Novel genetic techniques, under way in the United Kingdom, 88 will be needed to alter the strain's phenotypic features so that it can be grown in sufficient quantities in fertilized eggs and an effective vaccine can be constructed. Vaccine manufacturers are understandably reluctant to make the investment to develop and manufacture a new vaccine, particularly in large quantities, when there is uncertainty whether the avian strain will indeed spread and necessitate administration of hundreds of millions of doses. 89 Similarly, the sole manufacturer of the only oral neuraminidase inhibitor likely to be effective against avian influenza (oseltamivir) has very limited production capacity, and less than 2 million doses are currently available in US pharmaceutical stocks; the director of the CDC has stated that it would be desirable to have at least 100 million doses available. 89 In summary, 22 cases of cutaneous or inhalation anthrax traced to domestic bioterrorism and the global SARS outbreak represent ill winds that have blown considerable good. The greatly expanded US federal effort to improve national preparedness for bioterrorism has strengthened public health at every level, and whereas we are far from being able to consider the United States as fully prepared, we are better prepared than only 3 years ago. 90 The recent US epidemic of monkeypox, 91 traced to importation of infected exotic African rodents and the burgeoning domestic trade in US prairie dogs, could be considered a live tabletop exercise-with a relatively innocuous pathogen-for the recognition and containment of smallpox.",

            "text": "Similarly, the global SARS emergence has proved the enormous power of modern-day molecular biology to identify and characterize new pathogens, to detect clinical infections far more rapidly than in the past, and to quickly unravel the epidemiology of new infectious diseases-the scientific foundation for strategic control. The SARS outbreak was contained only by unprecedented international cooperation under the leadership of the World Health Organization 68 and successful coordination within the affected countries between national and regional public health agencies and health care providers. Controlling the next influenza pandemic, especially if it is caused by a highly virulent subtype such as the current A (H5N1) avian influenza virus, will require even greater international collaboration and vertical coordination in public health within the involved countries. It will also require an unprecedented commitment by the industrialized countries of the world to meet the needs of afflicted developing countries with limited public health resources. We are all in this together: it is in every country's self-interest to work collaboratively toward a common goal-the prevention of communicable disease and improvement of health of every citizen of the world.
