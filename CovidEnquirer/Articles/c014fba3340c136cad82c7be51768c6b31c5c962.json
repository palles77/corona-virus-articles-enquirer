            "text": "Human coronaviruses are known to be a common cause of respiratory infections in man. However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector PROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The semm samples of the adult group had coronavims-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8/51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20/51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavims infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF. This study shows that recombinant human coronavirus 229E proteins are suitable reagents for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus 229E infections. 0166-0934/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two test systems for the detection of 229E-specific IgGs were also compared: Western blot analysis using recombinant proteins; and the indirect immunofluorescence of 229E-infected Cl6 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence is a commonly used system for the determination of IgM-, IgA-and IgG-antibodies to 'native' virus proteins. It is a standard assay for the routine diagnosis of human coronavirus 229E infections (McIntosh et al., 1978) . The results indicate that IF is an adequate system to evaluate human coronavirus infections in adult patients, where repeated infection most probably leads to high titres of IgG. In contrast, IF seems to be less sensitive in the paediatric age group, where it can be expected that primary infections lead to lower IgG titres. Using this method, the overall seroprevalence of 229E-specific IgG was determined to be 16% in the paediatric age group. This figure is low compared to the reported values. For example, Hierholzer and Tannock (1988) reported seroprevalence ranges for human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 between 54 and 80% in the l-to 5-year-old group. It should be emphasised that the paediatric group sera were chosen not because of any implied involvement of coronavirus, but in order to encompass negative and low-titre samples.",

In a number of cases, specific antibodies to one or the other, but not both antigens, were detected.
