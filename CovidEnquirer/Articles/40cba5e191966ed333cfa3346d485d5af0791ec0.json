The safety of CFC has improved greatly since their introduction, and the risk of infectious diseases caused by plasma-derived preparations is now very small. However, everyone concerned with haemophilia, including various scientific and medical advisory committees, agrees that vigilance must be maintained to ensure that new and unpredictable emerging blood-borne pathogens will not again compromise the safety of CFC in the future. 1-3 The risk of transmission of infectious agents by a fresh blood component is very different from that for CFC because there might not be an effective pathogen inactivation or removal step in the preparation process, and the dose of infectious agent could be much higher than in CFC. The special danger of contamination of CFC with pathogens is that a single batch could be used to treat, and possibly infect, hundreds of patients, as happened with HIV. The pathogens discussed in this review are all potentially transmissible by fresh blood products. The susceptibility to individual pathogens in fresh blood products in a particular community will depend on the local epidemiology of the infectious agent. By contrast, CFC commonly cross continents from site of plasma collection and fractionation to use in recipients in a community with little experience of the agent. This review focuses on the potential for emerging risks of infectious agents in CFC because an essential publichealth objective is to prevent epidemics of serious viral infections in patients with haemophilia and others who depend exclusively on CFC for their well-being.",

            "text": "The National Academy of Sciences defines an emerging infection as one that is newly identified, re-emerging, or drug resistant, with an incidence in people that has increased within the previous two decades or is threatening to increase in the near future. 4 The first step of emergence, known as introduction, occurs when a previously unknown pathogen comes into contact with a new host population, or when an established pathogen changes its normal interaction pattern with its host population in some crucial way to increase in prevalence. In the second step, known as adaptation, the emerging agent becomes established and disseminates within the host population. The factors that contribute to this process are complex; they include microbial adaptation, advances in technology and industry, international travel and commerce, the breakdown of public-health measures, economic development and increased land use, changes in human demographics and behaviour, and war and famine. 4 The introduction of a new pathogen into a previously unexposed population typically occurs by interspecies, or As a result of immunological and nucleic-acid screening of plasma donations for transfusion-transmissible viruses, and the incorporation of viral reduction processes during plasma fractionation, coagulation-factor concentrates (CFC) are now judged safe in terms of many known infectious agents, including hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus. However, emerging pathogens could pose future threats, particularly those with blood-borne stages that are resistant to viral-inactivation steps in the manufacturing process, such as non-lipidcoated viruses. As outlined in this Review, better understanding of infectious diseases allows challenges from newly described agents of potential concern in the future to be anticipated, but the processes of zoonotic transmission and genetic selection or modification ensure that plasma-derived products will continue to be subject to infectious concerns. Manufacturers of plasma-derived CFC have addressed the issue of emerging infectious agents by developing recombinant products that limit the need for human plasma during production. Such recombinant products have extended the safety profile of their predecessors by ensuring that all reagents used for cell culture, purification steps, and stabilisation and storage buffers are completely independent of human plasma.",

For example, genetic analyses have suggested that HIV infection was transmitted to human beings from a common subspecies of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). 5 Another wellpublicised example of zoonotic transmission is severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused by the transmission of a new coronavirus to people, initially in southern China and probably from small mammals, which are the natural hosts of the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome coronavirus. 6 After the virus first appeared in human beings, there was an explosive short epidemic. Since clinical symptoms preceded the peak of transmission of this virus, outbreaks were restricted by quarantine measures in China, Canada, and other countries.

            "text": "A less widely known case of zoonotic transmission is of Nipah virus, a henipavirus that causes potentially lethal encephalitis. The natural host is the flying fox (fruit bat); cross-species transmission of the virus to animals occurred in southeast Asia where farmers inhabited areas that had been cleared of forests, inadvertently exposing their livestock to flying-fox habitats. 7, 8 In the late 1990s, there were several outbreaks of Nipah-virus infection in pigs, with subsequent transmission of the virus to human beings. In Malaysia, of 265 people infected during an outbreak of Nipah-virus infection, 105 died, a mortality rate of 40%. 9 Two other outbreaks of Nipah-virus infection have since occurred in Bangladesh. 7, 8 The mortality rate among infected individuals approached 70% in the Bangladeshi outbreaks, and in contrast to the Malaysian outbreaks, the virus might have been transmitted from one person to another. Hendra virus, a type of henipavirus, causes disease in horses and was reported to be transmitted via exposure to secretions from an infected racehorse to its trainer. The transmission vector remains unknown but could be an arthropod. 10 Any new viral pathogen poised to infect human beings must breach the natural barriers to zoonotic transmission that exist at the levels of cellular entry and viral expression. New emergent viruses might therefore have to acquire genetic mutations before active propagation within people is possible. Some RNA viruses have mutation rates as high as one nucleotide per 10 000 copied and therefore could be especially likely candidates for zoonotic transmission. 11 However, the evolution of a potentially large number of adaptive mutations that enable productive replication and efficient continuing transmission in a new host is rare, which might help to explain the low frequency of emerging agents. However, when an emerging pathogen does succeed in adapting to a new host species, the outcome can have a worldwide effect. New pathogens are also more likely to emerge in conjunction with opportunistic infections in highly immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with congenital immune defects, cancer, or AIDS. 12 Immunosuppression, especially in xenotransplantation settings, might enable a poorly adapted virus to replicate and adapt to human beings and act as a bridge to subsequent infection of the healthy population. 13, 14 These issues apply to infectious agents entering a new host population, but any pre-existing aetiological agent for which the incidence has increased within the previous two decades is also defined as an emerging pathogen. In many cases, an increase in incidence reflects a change in the interaction between host and vector, such as that caused by extraordinary changes in ecosystems. 15 For example, Rift Valley fever was the ultimate cause of a cumulative 200 000 deaths after construction of the Aswan Dam on the River Nile in Egypt in the 1960s created conditions in which the arthropod vector flourished. 16 Guanarito arenavirus emerged in Venezuela after forest clearing disrupted the local ecology. 17 This viral pathogen can be transmitted from rats to human beings, in whom it causes haemorrhagic fever and can pose a threat to the blood supply. As more people congregate within mega-cities, especially those of less developed countries with less advanced hygiene systems, more emerging infectious agents that arise by disruption of ecosystems can be expected.",

The parvovirus feline panleucopenia virus (FPLV) might therefore constitute a future threat to people because of its ability to cross mammalian barriers. It is a small non-lipid-enveloped virus that typically infects cats, mink, raccoons, Arctic foxes, and raccoon dogs. In 1978, a new pathogenic variant emerged in dogs and became known as canine parvovirus (CPV), 45 which causes hyperthermia, vomiting, diarrhoea, leucopenia, dyspnoea, myocarditis, pneumonitis, and in some cases, virus-induced encephalitis. 46, 47 FPLV took about a decade to assume its new host range. 48, 49 One of the first changes that differentiated CPV from FPLV and other animal viruses was in the haemagglutinin molecule. Since then, strains of CPV have undergone a series of changes, presumably in response to evolutionary selection, which resulted in the global distribution of new variants. 48 New antigenic variants (CPV2 types, including 2a, followed by 2b then 2c) have been isolated from cats and dogs in Japan and Brazil, which suggests that interspecies transmission, and presumably genetic conversion, continues. [50] [51] [52] Host adaptation of CPV in canines suggests the possibility of similar cross-species transmission, followed by adaptation in human beings. 52 This potential development could be accelerated by the close contact between dogs and people throughout the world. Because they are small, resistant, non-lipid-enveloped viruses, such emerging parvoviruses could pose a substantial future threat to blood and blood products.",

Two viruses, both of which were isolated in 1971, are of particular interest. JC virus was first isolated from the brain of a patient with Hodgkin's disease who subsequently developed progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. BK virus was first isolated from a susceptible immunosuppressed patient who had recently received a kidney transplant. The main site in the body found to harbour these viruses is the kidney. Lymphoid tissues, including bone marrow and spleen, have also been identified as sites of potential viral latency. [53] [54] [55] Both viruses have also been found in brain tumours. 56 BK virus causes mild upper-respiratory-tract symptoms, occasional pyrexia, and transient cystitis in immuno-competent individuals. In immunocompromised patients, the infection is predominantly associated with diseases of the urogenital tract, particularly haemorrhagic cystitis. 54 Nephropathy associated with BK virus is emerging as an important cause of renal dysfunction and loss of transplanted kidneys; the frequency of infection with BK virus in transplant recipients is 5%. 57, 58 Perhaps of greater concern, nucleic-acid sequences from the virus have been reported to persist in mononuclear cells of healthy blood donors. Thus, of 231 individuals tested in a study in two different centres, 29% were positive for BKvirus sequences. 54 Clinical infection with JC virus is generally found in association with long-term immunosuppression and other chronic diseases, including AIDS, lymphoproliferative diseases such as Hodgkin's disease and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. JC virus causes chronic meningoencephalitis and is associated with progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, a fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Typically, the course of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is gradual, with initial impairment of cognitive function, speech, vision, and movement. As it progresses, the pathology accelerates, and patients develop more severe disabilities, including dementia, paralysis, blindness, then coma, followed by death. The frequency of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy increased with the AIDS pandemic, but now, with effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected patients rarely develop this disorder. 51, 52 Shedding of JC virus (and BK virus) in urine is significantly more common in HIV-infected patients than in non-HIV-infected individuals. 59 Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is rare in children and young adults and is more common in people in their 50s and 60s; this feature suggests that reactivation of latent virus, and not primary infection, is the cause of viral disease.",

The prion protein in its physiological form, PrP c , is a normal membrane constituent. Its function is uncertain, although it might be involved in synaptic transmission or copper metabolism. The protein can undergo conformational change to a pathological form in which it is protease-resistant (PrP res ) and it might also have altered glycosylation. This conformational change increases the protein's ability to aggregate. This form is the agent that causes transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.",

            "text": "The most worrying manifestation of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies for people is variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which was first recognised in 1996. 60 The disease is caused by an infectious prion similar to that which causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted by consumption of contaminated tissue from bovine sources. The prion that causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is found in lymphoid tissue, in contrast to cases of the classic disease, and it therefore presents a potential risk of infection through blood and plasma-derived blood products. 61 Several studies have shown that prions can be transmitted through blood. In one study, 68% of PrP c quantified in normal blood samples was in the plasma compartment, which highlights the potential for similar distributions of infectious prion. Leucocyte depletion alone might be insufficient to prevent transmission of PrP res (figure 4). 62 Furthermore, sheep experimentally infected with the infectious prion associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy or scrapie transmitted the encephalopathies to unexposed sheep at a rate of 10-20% after whole-blood donations. Finally, two human cases of probable transmission of the prion associated with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by blood from donors who subsequently developed the disorder have been reported. In the first case, the recipient received a transfusion in 1996, developed a neurological disorder in 2002, and died 13 months after the onset of symptoms. At autopsy, characteristic spongiform change was seen in the brain. 63 The second patient died 5 years after a blood transfusion from a donor who subsequently developed variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. At autopsy, however, PrP res was found in the spleen and cervical lymph nodes, but there was no spongiform histological change or PrP res in the brain. 64 At present, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from infected blood donors poses mainly a theoretical risk to plasma-derived coagulation factors. 65 The risk could be less than that associated with fresh blood components because the pathogenic prion will be diluted in the starting plasma pool and because it is partly excluded by the differential protein fractionation process from the final CFC. 66 More highly purified CFC would probably carry a lower risk of prion transmission. However, without a reliable diagnostic test for prions, some concern about these agents will remain. In September, 2004, serious concerns prompted the UK Departments of Health to issue letters to 6000 recipients of products manufactured from UK plasma, warning them that there was a possibility of transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.",

By 1985, 74% of patients using factor VIII were seropositive. 68, 69 This degree of infection has had a profound effect on mortality among haemophilic patients. The median age at death among patients with haemophilia A decreased from 57 years before the HIV epidemic to 35 years in 1995, after the epidemic had grown to enormous proportions. By comparison, the median lifespan for HIV-negative haemophiliacs was 67 years in 1995. 70 Similarly, haemophilic patients previously have had high rates of infection with HBV and HCV. Virtually all patients treated with CFC before 1985 were exposed to HCV. 71 In one study of HIVnegative adults, 5% had chronic HBV antigenaemia, 71% were seropositive for HBV, and 82% were seropositive for HCV. 72 25% of the deaths of HIVinfected patients were from liver disease in 1997 to 1999. 73 These observations highlight an important clinical issue for the treatment of haemophilic patients-that infections with several viruses complicate and confuse the clinical picture. For example, among HIV-infected individuals, subsequent HBV infection produces chronic disease in about 50% of cases, compared with 10% among HIV-negative patients. 74 HIV infection of a patient chronically infected with HBV, however, results in a higher degree of HBV replication. Nevertheless, these patients have milder liver inflammation and less liver fibrosis than HIV-negative individuals because the pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection is governed by immune-mediated mechanisms. Treatment of the immunodeficiency in these patients can accelerate liver disease, so antiretroviral therapy in patients infected with both HIV and HBV should include at least one agent that is active against HBV.",

For example, because haemophilic patients need repeated infusions throughout their lives, the cumulative risk of transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases increases over their lifetimes, although currently the perceived overall threat is low. Furthermore, haemophilic patients are well informed about their disorder, and they might be expected to demand safer products when they hear about emerging infections.
