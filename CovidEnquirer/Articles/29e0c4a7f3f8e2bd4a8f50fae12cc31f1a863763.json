            "text": "Surveillance is the cornerstone of preventing and controlling infectious diseases of public health significance. The foundation for modern surveillance was laid down by William Farr (1807-83). Farr created a system to record the cause of death in England and Wales, a precursor to vital statistics systems around the world today. In the United States, Lemuel Shattuck collected data in Massachusetts that linked infectious disease to poor living conditions, which he used in 1850 to report the impact of public health interventions. Compulsory reporting of infectious diseases was first introduced in Italy in 1881, followed by Great Britain in 1890, and the United States in 1893. The current practice of surveillance around the world was influenced by Alexander Langmuir, chief epidemiologist at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1949 and 1969 (called the communicable Disease Center at that time). Langmuir identified the three main features of surveillance as (1) systematic collection of data, (2) consolidation and evaluation of these data, and (3) prompt dissemination of results. The dependence of the polio control program on surveillance in the 1950s focused attention on the critical role of reporting. Specifically, in 1955, several recipients of polio vaccine developed acute poliomyelitis, threatening national vaccination programs that were then in their early years. The United States developed an intensive national surveillance system, which assisted in demonstrating that the problem was limited to a single manufacturer of the vaccine, allowing the vaccination program to continue.",

Reporting sources were established in schools, among agricultural extension workers and others, and toward the end of the campaign, house-to-house searches were conducted in the few areas where endemic smallpox was still suspected. The last natural case occurred in Somalia in 1977.",

In the United States, the system of surveillance for drugresistant tuberculosis (TB) ceased in 1986 and was not reinstituted until the early 1990s when the problem had become evident. Continued surveillance with earlier detection of, and response to, the increase in multidrugresistant TB would have saved considerable public health resources and human suffering. Furthermore, even as new diseases such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection and cryptosporidiosis were recognized, surveillance was not undertaken in most states in the United States or in other countries during the mid-1980s and early 1990s until epidemiologic investigations revealed that outbreaks were often going unrecognized or detected late.",

For example, collecting disease data from animals or vectors may constitute part of surveillance for zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, such as rabies or the arboviral encephalitides.

The case definition may also depend on the epidemiologic circumstances; for example, surveillance for foodborne diseases may include criteria such as exposure to a point source of infection, such as a restaurant, to define cases. When a surveillance case definition is modified or updated, following the implementation of new laboratory methods, it may result in an apparent increase or decrease of disease rates over time.

When an increase in cases detected through surveillance appears to be due to an actual increase in disease incidence, this should be promptly communicated with the relevant health authorities so that appropriate action can be taken. Promoting close working relationships with data providers and public health partners should be considered a goal in the management of any surveillance system because such relationships increase the use of surveillance data for public health action. A clear interpretation of reported surveillance findings must be provided by the responsible public health professional because factors such as changes in the case definitions for public health surveillance, different mechanisms for identifying cases (i.e., active vs. passive), the introduction of new diagnostic tests, or the discovery of new disease entities may cause changes in disease reporting that are independent of the true incidence of disease.",

The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, with input from CDC, makes recommendations annually for additions and deletions to the list of nationally notifiable diseases.

IDSR targets 20 priority infectious diseases, which are broadly categorized as epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination and eradication (both are defined as a reduction of new infections to zero, but elimination requires continued measures to prevent reestablishment of disease), diseases that are endemic, and pandemic influenza.",

The impact of the new vaccine could be measured by ABCs, where a case is defined as isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from normally sterile sites (usually blood or cerebrospinal fluid). Between 1998-99 and 2005, the incidence of IPD (all serotypes) among children <5 years declined from 98.7 to 23.2 cases per 100 000 (Figure 4) . Use of the vaccine also reduced IPD among unvaccinated children and adults by reducing nasopharyngeal colonization and transmission of vaccine-type pneumococci from vaccinated children (i.e., indirect or herd effects). The reduction in IPD was driven by reductions in vaccine serotypes, resulting in an estimated 14 200 fewer IPD cases in children <5 years nationally. In contrast, the rate of IPD in children <5 years caused by nonvaccine serotypes increased from 16.8 to 21.7 cases per 100 000, largely due to an increase in serotype 19A. Results from ABCs suggest that the emergence of nonvaccine serotypes has occurred following the introduction of the vaccine and that including additional serotypes in pneumococcal vaccines, especially 19A, would further contribute to the reduction of IPD in the United States.",

ABCs defines a case of invasive GBS disease as the isolation of GBS from a normally sterile site or from the placenta or amniotic fluid in instances of fetal death. ABCs documented a 70% decline in the incidence of invasive GBS disease in the first week of life after the issuance of the first national consensus prevention guidelines in 1996, which recommended either screening pregnant women using prenatal cultures or assessing obstetric risk factors intrapartum. In 2002, ABCs data contributed to the issuance of revised national guidelines for the prevention of prenatal GBS disease, which recommends universal screening of pregnant women by culture for rectovaginal GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks' gestation and the use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS carriers. Since the implementation of these guidelines there has been a further decline in GBS. From 2002 to 2005 ABCs identified 1020 cases of early-onset disease (in the first week of life). Compared to the period 2000-01, before the guidelines were introduced, incidence of earlyonset disease during 2003-05 was 33% lower (0.33 vs. 0.49 cases per 1000 live births) (Figure 5) . However, further analysis indicated that while incidence decreased among white infants, it increased among black infants.

As this differs from country to country, a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is not possible. Understanding how people seek medical care can be performed by conducting health-care utilization surveys. For example, in Thailand people with pneumonia often go to hospital to seek care. Therefore, the IEIP pneumonia surveillance system in Thailand was set up in 20 hospitals in two provinces that serve a population of 1.2 million people. In contrast, in rural Kenya, people with pneumonia do not often go to hospital and so communitybased surveillance is more appropriate. To accomplish this, surveillance officers collect data about approximately 62 000 individuals by visiting their households every 2 weeks. Building the necessary surveillance infrastructure requires training of surveillance personnel; creating systems and procedures for the collection, transmission, and storage of data; building epidemiological and laboratory capacity within the country; and developing high-quality reference laboratory testing. A further strength of IEIP active population-based surveillance is that it provides a platform upon which research activities can be built, including etiology studies, intervention studies, and cost-effectiveness studies.",

Those with the highest risk of hospital admission due to influenza-related pneumonia were the young, elderly, and those with chronic diseases. Overall, the public health burden of influenza in Thailand was estimated at US$63 million per year. The surveillance system also documented clear seasonal trends in influenza incidence with a peak in July, breaking the dogma that influenza occurred at low levels year round in the tropics. Data from other tropical countries support this finding and have important implications for vaccine timing.

For example, air travel facilitated the spread of SARS from southern China to 29 countries around the world between November 2002 and July 2003. Multinational surveillance systems represent collaborative efforts by countries to control and respond to transnational disease threats. They do so through reporting cases of a disease in one country to alert other countries about possible outbreaks; identifying outbreaks where cases are distributed in small numbers across several countries; facilitating the investigation of common sources of infection, such as contaminated food or medicines; allowing tracking of disease trends at supranational or regional levels; and measuring the impact of control measures employed by different countries.",

A central component of the program is surveillance, whereby each country provides weekly surveillance data on vaccine-preventable diseases, which are analyzed by PAHO, and communicated to member countries via a weekly bulletin. Other regional surveillance networks include the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, and the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network.

The IHR included a set of legal obligations for WHO Member States, which broadly encompassed the reporting of human cases of cholera, plague, and yellow fever, and adherence to specified sanitary requirements for international ports and airports. In 1995, the World Heath Assembly agreed to fully revise the IHR, a process that took 10 years. The IHR (2005) have a much broader scope and new obligations for WHO Member States, largely influenced by recent global trends, including increased international trade and movement of people; the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases; increasing drug resistance; environmental changes; civil conflicts; natural and man-made disasters; and deliberate acts involving chemical, radiological, or infectious agents. To conduct surveillance of such a wide variety of events, IHR (2005) mandates the reporting of all 'public health emergencies of international concern' (Figure 7) . Four infectious diseases must always be reported to WHO: smallpox, poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus, human influenza caused by a new subtype (e.g., H5N1 in humans), and SARS. Other significant features of IHR (2005) include the requirement for Member States to provide detailed information in order that WHO may conduct an assessment of risk, a mandate allowing WHO to seek verification of events under IHR (2005) , and an obligation for all Member States to maintain core public health capacities for surveillance.",

The value of laboratory-based surveillance systems is somewhat dependent on the disease under surveillance.

Therefore, a surveillance system that includes all cases of laboratory confirmed N. meningitidis is likely to identify most cases. In contrast, relatively few cases of foodborne illness are identified by a laboratory and supplemental sources of surveillance data and epidemiologic surveys are needed to capture other cases (Figure 8) . The role of laboratory-based surveillance also depends on the frequency and clinical presentation of the disease. For example, measles is a relatively uncommon disease following the introduction of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and new cases should be confirmed by laboratory testing.",

With the advent of modern food processing, low-level contamination of a widely distributed product may occur over wide geographic areas and among diverse populations. To detect and control these outbreaks, CDC initiated PulseNet, a national network of public health laboratories that perform pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping of Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, and Yersinia pestis. Since 1995, PulseNet has used standardized PFGE methods to create a national database of PFGE patterns from laboratories across the country. Today more than 70 local public health and federal food regulatory agency laboratories participate in PulseNet and each one of them has their own local database with online access to the national database. This makes it possible to perform searches of local and national databases for clusters of PFGE patterns that are indistinguishable. PulseNet enables surveillance for foodborne outbreaks that previously were difficult to detect due to the physical distance between cases, and to differentiate disease outbreaks from sporadic cases of disease. PulseNet has revolutionized the detection of case clusters representing outbreaks of foodborne infections.",

However, between July 2006 and May 2007, a total of 628 cases were reported to PulseNet. Cases were reported from 47 states (Figure 9) . Twenty percent of patients were hospitalized; no deaths due to Salmonella Tennessee were reported. Interviews with patients identified many who had eaten peanut butter in the week before illness onset. A casecontrol investigation of 65 patients and 124 controls concluded that cases were more likely to have eaten Peter Pan or Great Value brand peanut butter (matched odds ratio \u00bc 10.9, 95% confidence interval \u00bc 3.8-43.0). Immediately, the Food and Drug Administration issued a health alert to consumers warning them not to eat these brands of peanut butter, and the manufacturer voluntarily recalled the products and ceased production. A search of patient isolates in the PulseNet database found three closely related PFGE patterns associated with this outbreak. Two of these outbreak strains were isolated from 21 unopened jars of peanut butter collected from 13 states. This was the first outbreak of a foodborne illness caused Events detected by national surveillance system -Smallpox -Poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus -Human influenza caused by a new subtype -Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)",

Since 2004, two laboratories, one in Michigan and the other in California, have been contracted by CDC to conduct genotyping of isolates from culture-positive patients. The genotyping laboratories use two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping methods for DNA analysis: spoligotyping, a hybridization assay that detects variability in the direct repeat region in the DNA; and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) analysis, which identifies the number of copies of DNA segments containing tandem repeated sequences. A further method, IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, which compares the number of copies and positions of the insertion element IS6110 in the genome, is used to further discriminate between two isolates with identical PCR results. Automated instruments determine the spoligotype and MIRU type, and the results are directly imported into a genotyping laboratory-tracking database. The database compares spoligotype and MIRU type with all other isolates previously submitted from the same TB program and emits a report directly to that program. TB genotyping identifies genetic relationships between Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from different TB patients. If the genotypes from two TB patients do not match they are unlikely to be involved in the same chain of recent transmission (within the previous 2 years). Two patients who have isolates with matching genotypes may be involved in the same chain of recent transmission, but this can be confirmed only if patients share epidemiologic links that can explain where and how they transmitted TB among themselves. Patients with matching genotypes that share no known epidemiological links are not likely to be involved in the same chain of recent transmission.",

Further review of health records revealed four additional cases of TB among residents in the same period. A further six cases were identified by matching the list of residents at the shelter with the statewide TB register and six more cases were identified among former residents. The M. tuberculosis genotyping database at the New York State Department of Health was searched for strains matching isolates from the reported cases and five additional TB cases among former residents were found. Active case finding among shelter residents identified another four culture-positive pulmonary TB cases. In total, 29 TB cases were identified. Of the 26 TB cases with genotyping data available, 11 shared the same genotype associated with the homeless shelter, 8 shared a different genotype, and 7 had genotypes not matching other residents.

However, modern surveillance systems must keep pace with the dynamic emergence of infectious diseases and the factors that influence it: human demographics and behavior; technology, economic development, and land use; international travel and commerce; microbial adaptation and change; and breakdown of public health measures. Included in these modern challenges is the need for preparedness to detect and respond to potential acts of bioterrorism. Modern technology also offers opportunities to further develop surveillance systems. For example, continued development of diagnostic and molecular laboratory methods, when effectively combined with epidemiologic information, can make prevention, recognition, and response to outbreaks faster and more precise.
