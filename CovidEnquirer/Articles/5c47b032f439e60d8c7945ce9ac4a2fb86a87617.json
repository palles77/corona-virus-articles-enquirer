Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of \u226550 breaths per min; fever of \u226539\u00b0C; C-reactive protein concentration of \u2265476\u00b720 nmol/L [\u226550 mg/L]). Each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least 3 days was randomly allocated to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo after thorough examination by a study physician at the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma research unit. Each episode was randomly allocated independently of previous treatment from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of ten (generated at the Pharmacy of Glostrup). Investigators and children were masked until the youngest child turned 3 years of age and throughout the data validation and analysis phases. The primary outcome was duration of the respiratory episode after treatment, verifi ed by prospective daily diaries and analysed with Poisson regression. Analyses were per protocol (excluding those without a primary outcome measure or who did not receive treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01233297.",

The mean duration of the episode after treatment was 3\u00b74 days for children receiving azithromycin compared with 7\u00b77 days for children receiving placebo. Azithromycin caused a signifi cant shortening of the episode of 63\u00b73% (95% CI 56\u00b70-69\u00b73; p<0\u00b70001). The eff ect size increased with early initiation of treatment, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p<0\u00b70001). We noted no diff erences in clinical adverse events between the azithromycin (18 [23%] of 78 episodes included in fi nal analysis) and placebo (24 [30%] of 79) groups (p=0\u00b730), but we did not investigate bacterial resistance patterns after treatment.",

            "text": "Childhood asthma is often preceded by recurrent episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in relation to airway infections in the fi rst years of life. 1,2 Treatment of such episodes represents a major unmet clinical need; they are the most common cause of admission to hospital in young children, are a reason for stress and anxiety for families, and cause a major draw on health-care resources. [3] [4] [5] We discovered in our birth cohort, the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2000 (COPSAC 2000 ; a previous birth cohort of children born to mothers with asthma), that airway bacteria (Haemophilus infl uenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) and respiratory viruses (at least one of picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, parainfl uenzavirus, infl uenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, or bocavirus) are equally closely associated with episodes of asthma-like symptoms in the fi rst 3 years of life. 6 Bacteria and viruses occurred together in most cases, challenging the previous hypothesis that episodes with asthma-like symptoms in this age group are largely virally induced. [7] [8] [9] This fi nding suggested that bacteria might play an equal part in the pathogenesis of such episodes and that treatment with antibiotics might ameliorate symptoms. At present, guidelines do not recommend antibiotics for treatment of early asthma-like episodes, 10 yet they are widely used. 4 We did a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of azithromycin for treatment of episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in young children who were followed up prospectively in our new unselected Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC 2010 ) birth cohort. 11",

Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of 50 breaths per min or higher, fever of 39\u00b0C or higher, or C-reactive protein [CRP] concentration of 476\u00b720 nmol/L [50 mg/L] or higher). Most mothers from the COPSAC 2010 cohort also participated in other medical trials while pregnant and may have received dietary supplements or an infl uenza vaccination (NCT00856947, NCT00798226, and NCT01012557). 11, 12 Additional details of baseline characteristics of the cohort are outlined in the COPSAC 2010 cohort design report. 11 This trial was approved by the ethics committee for Copenhagen (H-3-2010-065), Danish Data Protection Agency (2010-41-5023), and Danish Health and Medicines Authority (2612-4329). Parents of children gave written and oral informed consent before enrolment of participants. The complete biobank is publicly available at the Danish National Biobank. The entire COPSAC dataset, including the RCT-specifi c data, are currently being transferred to a publicly available database (the Danish Data Archive).",

We used the composite score of troublesome lung symptoms to describe asthma-like symptoms in the children, a score previously validated 13, 14 and used in our clinical observational cohort studies of young children 13,15-17 and a randomised controlled trial. 19 At each acute visit, the diary cards were reviewed with the family by trained COPSAC paediatricians to validate symptom defi nitions and severity. Additionally, the research paediatrician did a thorough physical examination, consisting of assessment of fever, tachypnoea, chest recessions, wheezing, and lung and heart auscultation, and examination of the skin, ears, nose, and throat. Furthermore, we measured CRP concentration (detection limit of 76\u00b719-1523\u00b784 nmol/L [8-160 mg/L]) in the peripheral blood with the QuickRead 101 instrument (Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland).

Such strict diagnostic procedure is paramount to clinical assessments, diagnoses, and treatments, which are otherwise poorly standardised in the community and more diffi cult in young children than later in life. 13 The in-depth clinical assessment of each respiratory episode by the study paediatrician before randomisation, including a thorough objective examination and CRP concentration measurement in the research clinic, ensured validity and homogeneity of the primary outcome and exclusion of children with clinical signs of pneumonia.

This routine ensured a high follow-up of the cohort, with 99% of the randomised children completing full followup until 3 years of age and only 6% of randomised treatments being unavailable. We obtained airway samples before treatment in 91% of episodes, with only 13 episodes missed. Our results are generalisable to a similar group of children with a known history of recurrent asthma-like symptoms, with or without concomitant treatment with inhaled steroids and with an episode duration of at least 3 days. An important limitation is that our data pertain to children with a Episode duration before treatment detailed clinical history and acute worsening judged by the study clinician. They cannot be generalised to a more liberal setting, such as initiation at home by parents or children with mild disease. This study is the fi rst, to our knowledge, to investigate and show an eff ect of azithromycin for treatment of acute respiratory episodes in young children with a history of recurrent asthma-like symptoms, in a cohort designed and powered to explore such eff ects. A third of all children will experience an episode of asthma-like symptoms in relation to airway infections before 3 years of age. 23 Shortening of such episodes by 63% is therefore clinically signifi cant to the child, families, health-care user, and society. We noted that azithromycin had a marked eff ect in relation to any given type of episode independently of the trigger, clinical presentation, or symptom duration before the intervention, which suggests a broad application.

            "text": "Asthma-like episodes in young children probably represent a heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Importantly, we excluded typical pneumonia based on predefi ned clinical criteria. Furthermore, most children (more than 80%) had undetectable concentrations of CRP and no fever at randomisation, and the treatment eff ect was similar in these children, strongly suggesting that the eff ect of azithromycin is not due to misclassifi cation of pneumonia. Azithromycin treatment was particularly eff ective in children who were treated shortly after symptom debut. This fi nding makes us speculate that azithromycin is mainly acting on the acute infl ammatory 24 or infectious 6, 25 processes related to exacerbations, rather than a persistent underlying infl ammation. This hypothesis is supported by the absence of eff ect on time to next episode. Alternatively, azithromycin acts by clearing bacterial pathogens indirectly responsible for the respiratory episode through subsequent co-infection by a viral trigger, and therefore the treatment was more eff ective when initiated early in the episode than when initiated late. 26 This study is based on our previous birth cohort study 6 in which we discovered that pathogenic airway bacteria and respiratory viruses are equally closely associated with acute episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children and mostly occur together. Our fi nding in this study that the treatment eff ect was strong, even in episodes for which no bacterial pathogen was detected, suggests that the eff ect of azithromycin is not only antibacterial. Macrolide antibiotics are active against both common airway pathogenic bacteria and atypical bacteria, [27] [28] [29] but also have anti-infl ammatory activity 24 and, possibly, antiviral eff ects. 30 Studies of macrolides in adults with severe asthma episodes are ambiguous, 31, 32 and macrolides reportedly reduce exacerbations in adults with an asthma type characterised by chronic neutrophilic infl ammation. 33, 34 Indeed, recurrent asthma-like symptoms in young children are also characterised by neutrophilic infl ammation, 25, 35, 36 which, in particular, might be present for episodes triggered by H infl uenzae. 34 This corresponds with our fi nding of a stronger azithromycin eff ect in episodes triggered by H infl uenzae. Viral infection in general did not predict an altered eff ect of azithromycin treatment. Low numbers in some viral species groups limit the conclusions drawn about eff ect modifi cation by specifi c viruses. Thus, the antibacterial, anti-infl ammatory, and antiviral pathways of azithromycin could have contributed to the shortening of episode length observed in this study. We cannot rule out that the eff ects noted are mainly anti-infl ammatory because episodes triggered by H infl uenzae induce neutrophilic infl ammation 34 and azithromycin also reduced episode duration in children without any evidence of bacterial infection. An RCT 37 of treatment with azithromycin in RSV-positive children showed a reduction of the neutrophilic marker interleukin 8 at day 14 after azithromycin treatment. This fi nding could point towards an anti-infl ammatory eff ect as the primary mediator of our fi ndings and also explain why fi ndings from previous RCTs 38, 39 have failed to show treatment eff ects of non-anti-infl ammatory antibiotics in acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.",

Treatment with azithromycin signifi cantly reduced the duration of treatment with \u03b22 agonists after intervention. The mean number of \u03b22 agonist days after azithromycin treatment was 8\u00b79 days versus 10\u00b71 days after placebo, corresponding to a calculated reduction in duration of \u03b22 agonist treatment of 22\u00b70% (95% CI 7\u00b70-34\u00b76; p=0\u00b7006). Too few episodes requiring oral steroids or admission to hospital occurred for this secondary outcome to be analysed statistically (azithromycin three [4%] episodes; placebo two [3%] episodes).",
