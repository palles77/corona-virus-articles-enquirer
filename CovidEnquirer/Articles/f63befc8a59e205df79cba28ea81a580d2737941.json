Fifty-three dogs and 33 cats with non-suppurative meningoencephalitis of unknown aetiology were examined immunohistochemically for 18 di\u00a1erent infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and prion protein Sc . In 14 (26%) of the dogs and 13 (39%) of the cats a causative agent was identi\u00a2ed in the central nervous system (CNS), two dogs and one cat giving positive results for two infectious agents simultaneously. The study revealed infections with known causative agents (porcine herpes virus 1, feline infectious peritonitis virus, Escherichia coli) and a new disease pattern of parvovirus infection in the CNS of dogs and cats. Infection of the CNS with feline leukaemia virus was found in a cat. Five dogs and four cats gave positive results forWest Nile virus (WNV) antigen. In one dog, canine parain\u00a3uenza virus antigen was detected in the brain. Four dogs and four cats gave positive results for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The signi\u00a2cance of the detection of WNVand EMCVantigen requires further study. The aetiology remained undetermined in 39 dogs (74%) and 20 cats (61%). Although it is possible that non-infectious causes play a more important role than previously thought, infections with hitherto unrecognized agents cannot be ruled out.",

Whilst most bacterial CNS infections induce a purulent in-\u00a3ammation, some bacteria, particularly Listeria spp., as well as protozoa, fungi and algae, cause a non-suppurative, mainly granulomatous in\u00a3ammation of the CNS (Rand et al., 1994; Summers et al., 1995; Tipold, 1995; Quesnel et al., 1997) . In the brains of beagles with granulomatous leptomeningitis, Maeda et al. www.elsevier.com/locate/jcpa (1993) demonstrated E. coli and considered it to be the causative agent. If parasites enter the CNS, they often induce a granulomatous in\u00a3ammation (Summers et al., 1995) . In dogs, the most common parasite to cause infection of the CNS is Toxoplasma gondii, followed by Neospora caninum and, albeit rarely, Cuterebra spp. In cats, Cuterebra spp. are the most common parasites to be found in the CNS, followed by T. gondii in rare cases (Braund, 2001) .",

The case selection was made in the light of a preliminary investigation which revealed that 274 of 1209 (23%) dogs and 146 of 741 (20%) cats examined in a 5-year-period (1998^2002) displayed changes in the CNS. Non-suppurative meningoencephalitis accounted for 22% and 49% of the CNS changes in dogs and cats, respectively. The cause of 49 canine and 32 feline cases remained undetermined after examination by routine diagnostic procedures. These 81 animals, together with four dogs and one cat with undetermined non-suppurative meningoencephalitis encountered in 2003, were included in this study.",

One dog showed WNV immunolabelling in numerous macrophages and microglial cells, and pyramidal cells in the cerebrum, hippocampus and midbrain, but only with the anti-NSP-1 antibody. Another dog, in contrast, showed immunoreactivity in a few neurons and macrophages in an in\u00a3amed part of the midbrain, but only with the anti-MEP-E antibody. One cat showed immunolabelling with both WNV antibodies in numerous neutrophils and occasional macrophages in the plexus chorioideus and laterally to the third ventricle.

This is generally suggestive of a viral aetiology (Summers et al., 1995) but has also been reported following hypoxic or toxic damage, which also sometimes produces demyelinating lesions (Braund, 1980; Lee et al., 2002) . Granulomatous CNS in\u00a2ltrates, observed in 10 dogs and two cats, are often considered to be associated with fungal, parasitic or bacterial infections. Fungal infections occur mainly in warmer climates (Gerds-Grogan and Dayrell-Hart, 1997 ) and, like parasitic infections, were not detected in the present study. In the 10 dogs referred to above, granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) was suggested by the histopathological \u00a2ndings and distribution of lesions. In six of these cases, toy breeds were a\u00a1ected (twoWest Highland white terriers, two chihuahuas, a shih tzu and a rehpinscher). Interestingly, three of the a\u00a1ected dogs belonged to large breeds (Landseer, Bordeaux Dogge and collie), in which GME is only rarely reported (Braund, 1985) . GME has been thought to be associated with viral infections including canine distemper, but no viral agent has been demonstrated in the CNS so far (Thomas and Eger,1989; Kipar et al.,1998) . E. coli antigen, as found in the brains of beagles with granulomatous leptomeningitis (Maeda et al., 1993) or in association with human cases of granulomatous encephalitis (Rickert et al., 2000) , was not observed in the present cases with suspected GME. The cat with abundant E. coli antigen in the brain in the present study showed perivascular in-\u00a2ltrations, indicating septicaemia.",

Histopathologically, these animals showed mild to moderate meningoencephalitis in the grey and white matter, mostly with granulomatous or pyogranulomatous in\u00a3ammation. In contrast, previous reports of WNV infection in birds and in mammals indicated that the grey matter was mainly a\u00a1ected and that the histopathology was characterized by lymphoplasmahistiocytic in\u00a3ammation with small numbers of neutrophils (Steele et al., 2000; Cantile et al., 2001; Buchweitz et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2003; Lichtensteiger et al., 2003) . Polyclonal WNV-speci\u00a2c antibodies used for immunolabelling often cross-react with other \u00a3aviviruses (Steele et al., 2000; Kelly et al., 2003; Chvala et al., 2004) . The monoclonal antibodies speci\u00a2c for the major envelope protein E (anti-MEP) and non-structural protein 1 (anti-NSP-1) used in this study (Tables 1 and 2 ) crossreact with Kunjin virus, also a member of the Flaviviridae (Scherret et al., 2001) . Presumably, the anti-NSP-1 antibody is more speci\u00a2c than the anti-MEP antibody (Hall, 2000) . This might explain its stronger immunoreactivity in the present study and might support the identi\u00a2cation of a WNV infection. The a\u00a1ected animals did not react positively for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus antigen with a polyclonal speci\u00a2c antibody that may cross-react with other \u00a3aviviruses (H. Weissenbo \u00ba ck, personal communication). However, it is still possible that the positive WNV reaction was due to infection with other cross-reactive agents or represented molecular mimicry of host-derived antigens (Oldstone, 1998) . The latter possibility receives some support from studies indicating that dogs and cats can be infected with WNV but usually develop only a low viraemia, without clinical signs or histopathological changes in the brain (Blackburn et al.,1989; Lichtensteiger et al., 2003; Austgen et al., 2004) . Furthermore, no evidence of WNV infections in domestic animals has so far been detected in Germany. Therefore, the signi\u00a2cance of the present \u00a2ndings requires further studies.",

            "text": "A further surprising \u00a2nding was the detection of EMCVantigen in the CNS of four dogs and four cats. EMCV-speci\u00a2c antibodies have been detected in primates, mice, rats, horses and elephants in various parts of the world, the rat being the natural host (Nowotny et al.,1993; Nowotny,1996; Psalla et al., 2006) . In Austria, a low seroprevalence has been reported in cats (Nowotny,1996) , but not dogs. In Germany, EMCV-associated non-suppurative meningoencephalitis is reported occasionally in man, but the virus has been isolated from the CNS in only a few cases (Nowotny et al., 1993; LaRue et al., 2003) . The histopathological changes reported here varied (neuronal necrosis, mild lymphohistiocytic meningitis, severe generalized granulomatous or pyogranulomatous meningoencephalitis). In pigs with natural EMCV infections, lymphohistiocytic in\u00a2ltrates in the CNS have been described (Gainer et al., 1968) . Experimentally infected mice and pigs also develop lymphohistiocytic, perivascular in\u00a2ltrates in the CNS, poliomeningoencephalomyelitis being the predominant feature in mice (Topham et al., 1991; LaRue et al., 2003) . In the present study, EMCV immunolabelling was observed in perikarya and processes of neurons in some animals, indicating neurotropism similar to that observed in experimental EMCV infection. The EMCV-positive cells, associated with cerebral vessels, may have been endothelial cells or pericytes. Neither cell type has been reported to be susceptible to EMCV, but endothelial and mesenchymal cells in organs other than the CNS are regularly infected with EMCV, as shown by Papaioannou et al. (2003) in pigs. The detection of EMCV antigen in macrophages in the CNS of dogs and cats may support their role in viral replication and distribution, as proposed by Papaioannou et al. (2003) . In natural EMCV infection of pigs, interstitial myocarditis and myocardial degeneration represent the main features (Papaioannou et al., 2003) . Neither change was observed in any of the present cases, but myocardial tissue was available from only one dog and two cats.",

Due to the retrospective character of the study, a standardized clinical and neurological investigation and serum and CSF laboratory procedures were not possible. In the remaining cases, infection cannot be ruled out. Other agents that might have caused the observed histopathological changes in dogs include Ehrlichia spp. (Glaus and Jaggy, 1992; Maretzki et al., 1994) , Leptospira spp. (Rentko et al., 1992) and Borrelia spp. (Mandel et al.,1993; Chang et al., 2001) , and in cats Bartonella henselae (Breitschwerdt et al., 1999) cannot be excluded. However, the high percentage of cases in which no infectious agent was identi\u00a2ed suggests that non-infectious causes are more common than anticipated. Various factors, ranging from autoimmune processes to intoxication, have already been suggested as causes of non-suppurative changes in the CNS (Kipar et al.,1998; , Lee et al., 2002 .",

In most of the cases showing these unexpected reactions the histopathological changes were severe and often resembled GME. Autoimmune mechanisms have already been discussed as a possible cause of canine GME and pug dog encephalitis (Kipar et al., 1998; . Other factors that may have played a role in the \u00a2ndings described include the following: epitope spreading Vanderlugt et al., 1998) ; hereditary factors, as already suspected in pug dog encephalitis and non-suppurative meningoencephalitis in greyhounds (Hinrichs et al., 1996; Callanan et al., 2002) ; intoxication (Lee et al., 2002) ; increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier in systemic illness, due to prostaglandins and interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, leading to in\u00a2ltration of the CNS by in\u00a3ammatory cells (Reiss et al., 2000) . In addition, it should be mentioned that, unlike paraneoplastic encephalitis, which has been described in man but not in dogs or cats (Scaravilli et al., 1999) , paraneoplastic polyneuropathy has been described in dogs (Braund, 1990; Wagner, 2002) . As tumours in the CNS or other organs were present in only one of the cases examined, paraneoplastic encephalitis seemed unlikely to have played any role in the \u00a2ndings.",
