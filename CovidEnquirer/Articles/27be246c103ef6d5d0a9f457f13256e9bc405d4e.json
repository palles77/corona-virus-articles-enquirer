This paper reported that there existed a group of TMV recombinants in which the fused foreign peptides contained a transmembrane domain according to the predictions by three programs of SOSUI, TMpred and DAS. Further studies showed for the first time that a foreign transmembrane domain in a fused peptide of the corresponding TMV recombinant would result in the local lesions on the susceptible tobacco leaves. In addition, it was concluded that none of the TMV recombinants that systematically infected susceptible tobacco contained a transmembrane domain in the coat protein subunits. D",

In infected tobacco, the viral coat protein (CP) may constitute up to 7% of the total host protein in quantity and can be easily purified from plant tissue in the form of viral particles. TMV has been considered as a vector to express foreign proteins or short peptides in host plants due to its high replication efficiency and stability of virions in host plants. For expressing a short peptide, the coding sequence was fused inframe to the CP coding sequence close to the C-terminus. The resulting recombinant CP subunits could function as the wildtype CP subunits in assembling viral genome to particles and the objective short peptides would be expressed on the surface of the particles (Lim et al., 2002; Bendahmane et al., 1999; Fitchen et al., 1995; Gilleland et al., 2000; Hamamoto et al., 1993; Koo et al., 1999; Staczek et al., 2000; Sugiyama et al., 1995; Takamatsu et al., 1990; Turpen et al., 1995) . Such expressed short peptides were suggested to be useful for vaccine purpose, especially in stockbreeding, as the immunogenicity was highly enhanced when the CP subunit was injected into animals as an adjuvant Gilleland et al., 2000; Koo et al., 1999; Staczek et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2003) .",

At present, little is known about the mechanisms that control the display of a foreign peptide on the surface of the recombinant TMV. It was ever proposed that the charge and isoelectric point of the recombinant CP subunit might play an important role in the successful display of a foreign peptide on the surface of TMV . Here, we reported for the first time that a group of recombinant TMV genomes encoding short peptides with a transmembrane domain induced necrotic local lesions on susceptible tobacco N. tabacum Samsun nn and N. tabacum Xanthi nn while the transmembrane domain was adapted from various known proteins, such as the spike and membrane proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003) , the sodium-phosphate coupled transporter protein DvSPT1 of Dunaliella viridis and the voltage-gated sodium channel protein Scn2a of rat (Noda et al., 1986) . Interestingly, further analysis led us to conclude that among the reported CP subunits encoded by infectious TMV recombinants, none contained any transmembrane domains.",

The cDNA fragments specifying the fused S1241, M109 and M125 sequences could be amplified by RT-PCR analysis from young leaves of the corresponding infected tobacco plants ( Fig. 2A , lanes 3, 4, 6), which were confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown).

Based on the symptoms on the susceptible tobacco plants, there were two groups of TMV recombinants: systemic infection-related and necrotic local lesion-related. The former includes those encoding the fused peptides F11, F14 and F14mu from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 protein (Wu et al., 2003) , F25 and F20 from FMDV VP1 protein (Jiang et al., 2006) , ZP3 from murine zona pellucida ZP3 protein (Fitchen et al., 1995) , 9-14mer from Pseudomonas aeruginosa protein F Staczek et al., 2000) , G5.24 from rabies virus glycoprotein , 5B19, 5B19L and RB19E from murine hepatitis virus (MHV) S-glycoprotein Koo et al., 1999) , neuropeptide nocistatin mNST from bovine brain (Lim et al., 2002) , ACEI inhibitor (Hamamoto et al., 1993) , pep8 and pep18 from influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) (Sugiyama et al., 1995) , pep13 from human immunodeficiency virus type I envelop protein (Sugiyama et al., 1995) , (QGPGAP) 2 from malaria (Turpen et al., 1995) and peptides S1241, M109, M109mu and M125 from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike and membrane protein (Marra et al., 2003) studied in this paper.

However, predicted by the three programs, none of the above TMV recombinants contained any transmembrane domains in the corresponding CP subunit. This observation suggested that the TMV recombinants that caused typical systematic infections on susceptible tobacco plant contained no transmembrane domains in their recombinant CP subunits, however, to TMV recombinants that induced necrotic local lesions, a transmembrane domain in the recombinant CP subunits seemed not to be necessary.",

In this paper, we looked into, for the first time, a possible relationship between the transmembrane domain in the CP subunits and the induction of the local lesions on susceptible tobacco plants, and concluded that the transmembrane domain at the C-terminus of the recombinant CP subunit in the region of the fused foreign peptide would determine the corresponding TMV recombinant to induce the necrotic local lesion response on the inoculated leaves of Samsun nn tobacco plant as well as Xanthi nn tobacco (data not shown); we also concluded that none of the reported infectious TMV recombinants contained any transmembrane domains in the CP subunits. The transmembrane domains involved in this report were adapted from different proteins and organisms and shared no homologies in the sequences to each other (data not shown); however, all the corresponding TMV recombinants caused necrotic local lesions on the inoculated leaves of the Samsun nn and Xanthi nn (data not shown) tobacco plants.",

As shown in Table 2 , some exceptional examples such as TMVF14 (Wu et al., 2003) and TMVF25 (Jiang et al., 2006) with the pI/charge values of 8.86/+3 could systematically infected Samsun nn plants, and had no mutations in the entire CP region in its progenies.

The N gene-mediated HR is temperature sensitive, the resistance to TMV occurred only at temperatures below 30 -C (Weststeijn, 1981) ; however, our unpublished data indicated that the TMV recombinants encoding foreign peptides M63, M81 and FN20 (Table 1) could induce necrotic local lesions on Samsun NN at both 25 -C and 32 -C (data not shown). However, the lesions caused by the TMV recombinants encoding a fused transmembrane domain appeared at the same time as wtTMV did on Samsun NN, albeit in some cases, the lesions appeared about 1 day later than wtTMV. The size, color and the amount of the lesions caused by this group of the TMV recombinants were similar to wtTMV (data not shown).",
