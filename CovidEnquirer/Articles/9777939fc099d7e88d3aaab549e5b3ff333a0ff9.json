These nucleoside analogues are characterized by the presence of one nitrogen atom in the sugar ring moiety. Replacement of the oxygen atom of a furanose nucleoside by an amide function would deliver us ribopyranuronamide nucleosides. The amide resonance would give the nucleosides with a restricted conformational flexibility as is seen with cyclohexenyl nucleosides. 13 Few attempts have been described before to synthesize pyranuronamide nucleosides. 14, 15 In 1987, Timoshchuk 14 described the synthesis of the N-unsubstituted-a-D-xylopyranuronamide sugar moiety by the rearrangement of the a-D-xylopyranuronamide in BF 3 $Et 2 O and acetic anhydride. However, they failed to introduce the base moiety using fluorouracil as example. In 2005, Van Rompaey et al. 15 isolated the acetyl-protected 4-azido 6-oxopiperidinyl nucleoside with the 6-chloropurine base, as unexpected compound during a sugar-base condensation reaction.",

[18] [19] [20] Removal of the 5,6-O-isopropylidene protection group was carried out under mild acidic conditions (75% acetic acid). Without purification, the obtained diol was oxidized to an aldehyde intermediate and further to the carboxylic acid 4. 21 The methylamide group of 6 was introduced by esterification of the carboxylic acid 4 to yield compound 5 followed by reaction with methylamine under pressure. 22, 23 The critical reaction in this synthetic scheme is the rearrangement of the furanose ring to the N-methyl-D-ribopyranuronamide ring starting from N-methyl-1,2-O-isopropylidene-a-D-ribofuranuronamide (6) in a reproducible way. 14 This rearrangement was accomplished using BF 3 $Et 2 O followed by acetylation using acetic anhydride to obtain N-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetra-O-acetyl-D-ribopyranuronamides (7a and 7b). However, these compounds easily undergo elimination reaction in the presence of Lewis acid. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction indicated that four products are formed. The two more mobile compounds were separated by column chromatography, and shown by 1 H NMR to be the desired products, 7a and 7b. The anomeric configuration of the compounds 7a and 7b was deduced from the 1 H NMR coupling constants and confirmed where appropriate by Noediff experiments. In this way, compound 7b was shown to be the a-anomer mainly on the basis of the small long-range coupling of 1.3 Hz between H-1 0 and H-3 0 , pointing to a W-coupling path between these two protons. This can happen only when both protons are equatorial and thus cis-oriented, and therefore only possible in the a-anomer. The rather high coupling constant J 2 0 ,3 0 \u00bc7.9 Hz in the other isomer 7a, which has thus the b-configuration, can be rationalized by the adoption of a more boat-like conformation of this six-membered lactam ring. This also explains the absence of a large J 1 0 ,2 0 coupling between these two trans-oriented protons.",

            "text": "The structure of compounds 1a, 1b was unambiguously assigned using a combination of NMR techniques (H,H-COSY, H,C-HSQC, and H,C-HMBC). Compound 1b shows a large 1 H NMR coupling constant (J\u00bc8.0 Hz), which is typical for a trans di-axial relationship between H-1 0 and H-2 0 . This implies a b-configuration. Compound 1a is then the a-anomer having a slightly distorted half-chair conformation and resulting in an increased coupling constant between H-2 0 and H-3 0 (J 2 0 ,3 0 \u00bc5.5 Hz), and the disappearance of the long-range H-1 0 /H-3 0 W-coupling. Noediff at H-1 0 gave a significant signal increase only for H-2 0 , and thus confirms the C-1 0 conformation and at the same time the a-configuration of 1a. In the same way, we characterized compounds 2a and 2b and also the protected derivatives 10a, 10b, and 11a, 11b, since they all showed very similar 1 H-couplings as in 1a and 1b. Compound 1a is the more mobile one on TLC of the two diastereoisomers. Normally we had expected that the presence of the 2 0 -O-acetyl group would direct sugar-base condensation reaction in the direction of the b-anomer via intermediate 12 (Fig. 2) . Apparently, this is not the sole mechanism as a considerable amount of the a-anomer is formed. The N-Me group may participate in the reaction mechanism analogous to the condensation reaction of N-methyloxycarbonyl protected pyrrolidine and nucleobase via the formation of an iminium ion (13) . 26 The infrared absorption of compound 7a (1694 cm \u00c01 ) is situated at somewhat higher wavelength than that of N-methyl-a-piperidone (1669 cm \u00c01 ), which may indicate lesser amide resonance. [27] [28] [29] This suggests that the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of the cyclic amide (7a and 7b) can be involved in the mechanism of sugar-base condensation reaction.",

Accurate mass spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform ioncyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer, apex-Qe (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) with a passively shielded 9.4 T superconducting magnet equipped with an Apollo 2 CombiSource (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Tuning in positive electrospray mode to resolution of 95,000 (at m/z 400) and calibration (from m/z 100 to 1500) were performed using poly-DL-alanine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Spray voltage was set to 4000 V, capillary temperature 240 C. Samples were infused in a water/ acetonitrile (1:1) mixture with a flow rate of 180 mL/h; 32 scans of 512k datapoints were acquired and averaged. For the acquisition and processing, software ApexControl 1.0 and DataAnalysis 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) were used, respectively. Precoated aluminum sheets (MN ALUGRAM SIL G/UV 254 20\u00c220 cm) were used for TLC; the spots were examined with UV light. Preparative TLC was performed on 20\u00c240 cm plate coated with MN-Silica Gel P/UV 254. Column chromatography was performed on ICN silica gel 63-200, 60 \u00c5. Analytical HPLC was performed on waters 600E-2487 system using Alltima HP C18 column (4.6\u00c2250 mm) at the flow rate of 1 mL/min by a gradient elution of acetonitrile and water. Preparative HPLC was performed on waters 1525-2487 system using Prep C18 5 mm column 19\u00c2150 mm at the flow rate of 16 mL/min by a gradient elution of acetonitrile and water. Elemental analyses were performed at the Department of Chemistry, K.U. Leuven.
