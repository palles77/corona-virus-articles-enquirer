Composite structures are usually multilayered fi lter media, each layer serving a specifi c purpose in the fi ltration/ separation process. All the layers of a composite are not necessarily nonwovens. One or more of the layers could be a membrane material, a woven material, or a plastic or metal mesh material to provide structural support. Further, there are two contrasting styles of laminated structure, depending on whether the fi lter medium is intended to function by depth fi ltration or by surface fi ltration. With depth fi ltration, the medium should be graded so as to increase the fi neness of fi bers in the direction of fl ow. The upper, coarser layers will act as a prefi lter, in which the larger particles are retained, with the smaller particles then being trapped subsequently in the fi ner layers. This will maximize the dirt holding capacity per unit area of medium, and hence its life before it is discarded. In the case of surface fi ltration, material consisting of fi ner pores/larger surface area should be at the upstream side, so that it can be cleaned intermittently for regeneration purpose.",

For illustration, although fi ltration capability by electrospun nanofi bers and meltblown nonwovens is very high, they tend to be fairly weak and are generally too thin. The mechanical strength of nanofi brous layer/meltblown nonwovens are not suffi cient to withstand macroscopic impact during fi ltration applications such as normal liquid or air fl ow passing through them. Stronger materials are therefore required for such applications, and materials which have been demonstrated to offer suitable mechanical strength include woven fabric, spunbond, spunlace (hydroentanged), needlepunch felt, or cellulose web.

In all these applications, fi ner fi ber materials need to be supported by a stronger component in composite. There is another perspective of the use of thin layers of fi ner fi bers. The media made out of fi ner fi ber lead to higher fi ltration effi ciency at the cost of higher pressure differential across the fabric. For a suitable balance between effi ciency and levels of pressure, use of a thin layer of fi ner fi ber component in a composite is required. The fi ner fi ber layer can be positioned upstream before the macro fi ltration substrate to enhance surface fi ltration performance or downstream of the macro fi ltration substrate to improve depth fi ltration in order to capture particles within the body of the media. Finer media at the upstream side of surface fi lters lead to better cake dislodgement and prevention of particle penetration inside fi lter media (Kothari et al. , 1993; Ciach and Gradon, 1998; Call\u00e9 et al. , 2002) , which in turn results in better long term performance of fi lter media. However, a thin layer of nanofi bers on meltblown media has a weak bond and higher production costs (Lydall Filtration and Separation, 2013) . The weak bond is a problem in the nanofi ber layer in self-cleaning or pulse cleaning fi lter applications. The dust cake formed on the upstream side of the fi lter media can be removed by back-pulsing air through the media to rejuvenate it. As a great force is exerted on the surface during the back-pulse, nanofi bers with poor adhesion to substrates, or comprised of delicate nanofi bers, can delaminate when the shock wave moves from the interior of the fi lter through the substrate to the nanofi ber. However, the new nanofi ber technology was reported to provide excellent adhesion to the substrate, enabling longer life and improved effi ciencies in pulse-cleaning applications because of greater particle collection and overall energy expended during the cleaning process. The plurality of nanofi ber layers also provides superior durability (Wertz and Schneiders, 2009) .",

Researchers have also developed an industrial gas fi lter medium consisting of 70% polymers with a regular melting temperature and 30% polymers with a low melting temperature. This medium employs polyester felts as the base material for the polymer mix, with a prepared polyamide nano-sized web at the upstream side of the fabric (Yeo et al. , 2007) . A thermal roller was employed to bond the overlapped fi lter medium. Subsequent work to evaluate fi ltration capability revealed greater collection effi ciency and more stable fi ltration behavior in the medium with the nano-sized web showing more stable fi ltration behavior and improved collection effi ciency. The levels of dust found to be left in fabric containing nanofi ber web was also revealed to be far lower than those in fabric with no nanofi ber web (Yeo et al. , 2007) .

Combination is also possible by ultrasonic welding. Hydro-entanglement and needlepunching are also interesting options for the joining together of two layers to produce composite fi ltration materials. In one study, the needlepunching technique was used as the initial step in preparing P84 needlefelt. P84 needlefelt was then prepared by taking the upstream side of felt, constructed of standard 2.2 dtexfi ber, and adding 1.0 dtexmicrofi ber. This produces a medium capable of increasing gas fi ltration effi ciency by preventing deep dust penetration, maintaining stable pressure drop, and facilitating good bag life. As well as being an effective fi ltration medium in gas fi ltration systems, P84 fi bers can additionally be used as either a PTFE (polytetrafl uoroethylene) fi ber blending partner, or in the construction of surface layers on homopolymer acrylic, polyester or m -aramide felts (Connor, 1997) .

A second component (B) was constructed from 2.22 dtex polyester fi bers, and the two materials were then used to compose the nonwoven composite using layers in an A/B/C/B order, forming a sandwich structure with a basic weight of 500 g/m 2 .

Hence it helps in better membrane performance in terms of salt rejection, improved fl ux, thermal stability and proton conductivity. The membrane is essentially a surface fi ltration device, with little or no depth fi ltration involved in its use. In practice, many membranes are of asymmetric structure and effectively comprise two layers. The active, surface layer is a very thin skin, the permeability of which is of critical importance. The lower, thicker layer is of more open structure, its role being to serve as a mechanical support for the active layer. One of the most popular membranes is PTFE. The advantages of the PTFE (naturally hydrophobic) membrane are its superior chemical and temperature resistance and its non-sticky nature.

When applied to the needlefelt surface, coatings form a quasimembrane structure. The addition of a Tefl on B coating on the surface of glass fi ber fabric for boiler applications is common (Carr and Smith, 1984) . During the late 1980s Ravensworth Ltd developed a range of coated materials, under the trade name of Ravlex, for achieving superior fi ltration performance. Three main product groups are generally used for the coating process: Ravlex MX, Ravlex PPC and Ravlex YP. Ravlex MX is a PTFE microporous embedded coating which is applied to the carrier needlefelt fi ltration surface. Ravlex MX is generally used for the fi ltration of fi ne particles in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. Formulated from PTFE, the Ravlex PPC coating offers higher permeability than the Ravlex MX due to its larger pore size, thereby making it suitable for the fi ltering agglomerating or sticky dusts. With a pore structure similar to Ravlex PPC, Ravlex YP is formulated from polyurethane (PU), whilst another recent product, Ravlex CR, is formulated from PTFE coating. As previously outlined, all such coatings usually offer such benefi ts as high abrasion resistance, effective cake release, increased air permeability, reduced operational pressure drop (resistance to blinding), reduced cleaning frequency and extended fi lter operational life (Gibbons, 2002; Lydon, 2004; Ravensworth Ltd, 2004a , 2004b .",

These materials are not, however, usually resistant to hydrolytic conditions, which can potentially lead to structural collapse and premature pressurization. The specifi c density of the foam when applied to the material is also essential for successful application. If the density is too high, the substrate is wetted excessively. This leads to inadequate penetration and poor mechanical bonding as a result of the unacceptable air permeability and too low a density, increasing the risk of delamination. (Goosens, 1993; Menardi Filters, 2013) Uniform, smaller sized pores can be achieved on the fabric surface via the use of powders, which are chemically inert additives. By pre-coating the new fabric fi lters with this powder, the fi lter surface develops a protective coating. Calendaring can help achieve effective powder coating, thanks to the lower melting point of the powder in comparison to the nonwoven fabric. The powder, which is scattered onto the surface of nonwoven fabric, melts together with the fi bers to form a layer of smaller pores.",

The coatings applied by low pressure plasma polymerization also give good resistance to abrasion and washing.

The outer layers can also serve as a containment to inhibit medium migration, dusting, and particle fallout from the inner layers. It may be added that process air from machining operations can have high concentrations of liquid aerosols, up to 100 mg/m 3 , and can cause several types of serious health effects on workers. A good drainage capacity is a vital requirement in a multistage fi ltration system. The SMS fabric as referred to earlier (Section 8.2.1) works under the aforesaid philosophy wherein the meltblown middle layer provides higher fi ltration performance as compared to spunbonded side layers. As the meltblown layer conducts the fi nal fi ltration, the spunbonded layer acts as a prefi lter. In the gradient density medium, the differing bulk of each layer provides an increasingly effi cient level of fi ltration; as the fl uid moves through these increasingly fi ne layers, smaller and smaller contaminant particles are removed. Better fi ltration has been found through producing a unique gradient structure made in two steps. In the fi rst step, a pile stitch-bonded nonwoven with a one loop surface is manufactured. In the second step, the one loop surface of pile stitch-bonded nonwoven is compressed by putting a hydroentangled nonwoven on it (Smithies and Zimmerman, 2005; Lin et al. , 2006) . The result is a gradient density medium and a photomicrograph of the structure is shown in Fig. 8.10 . The product is unique in that the fi bers of the upper pile surface are oriented in the direction of fl ow. This is in contrast to the conventional fi lter media where the fi bers are generally perpendicular to the direction of fl ow. The share in pile ranges from 98% to 99% and the number and size of cavities between the fi bers depend on the fi neness of fi bers used and the fabric thickness. The product is found to be useful for depth fi ltration applications.",

Due to the gradient pore size, these media have a high dustholding capacity and low pressure drop. The multilayer construction can combine mechanical fi ltration (a prefi lter that removes most particles), electrostatic fi ltration (the middle layer allows high initial fi ltration effi ciency) and the last layer/fi lter that allows high effi ciency for all fi lter life. The triple-layer construction makes it possible to create different kinds of products by simply modifying the grammage or the fi ber composition of the layers. The composite can be pleatable on different kinds of pleating machines. It is also possible to mix different fi bers (a wide range of natural, mineral, synthetic and man-made fi bers of varying length) and obtain a wide range of fi ber orientation ranging from random to parallel with the consequent differences in fi ltration performances and applications. The system is fl exible to incorporate gas adsorption media (for example activated carbon granules) on-line in the middle layer, obtaining an effi cient fi lter for gas odor removal. This innovative concept of wet lay technology can create nonwovens with special properties, i.e. high effi ciency fi lter media (or gas-adsorption fi lter media) combined with a very low pressure drop. These advantages make these nonwovens extremely useful for applications such as cabin air or HVAC where high permeability assures a consistent air-fl ow into the fi ltration system (Ahlstrom Technical Specialties, 2001; Montefusco, 2005) . It may be noted that there are other ways of creating a gradient structure, for example the Intrepid\u2122 fi lter medium by Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.

One feature common to all multifunctional reactors is their facilitation for the substitution of a single process unit in place of at least two, allowing all necessary operations to be carried out simultaneously. The catalytic reactions occurring in catalytic fi lters have been found to be useful in one such application, as they are able to remove particulates from fl ue gases (from, for example, waste incinerators, diesel engines, boilers, pressurized fl uidized bed coal combustors, or biomass gasifi ers, amongst others) whilst also abating chemical pollutants (including nitrogen oxides, dioxins, volatile organic compounds, tar and carbonaceous material). A thin layer of the catalyst is applied directly onto the fi lter material, which may either be rigid (consisting of fi lter tubes made of sintered granules) or fl exible (nonwoven fabrics) (Matatov-Meytal and Sheintuch, 2002; Fino et al. , 2004) . In applications such as incinerators, pyrometallurgical and cement kilns, the combination of surface fi ltration and catalysis (ALSOM Power, 2008) has created new methodologies which destroy gaseous dioxins and captures solid phase emissions, leading to operational cost savings. Effi cient particle, NO x and VOC removal can be achieved via the use of fabric fi lters or ceramic hot gas fi lter elements (foam candles) which combine a fi ne fi ltering outer membrane with an integrated catalyst in the support structure (Spivey, 1993; Bonte et al. , 2002; Hackel et al. , 2005; Nacken et al. , 2007; ALSOM Power, 2008; Heidenreich et al. , 2008) . The combination of a fi lter and an SCR (selective catalytic reduction) reactor in one unit ( Fig. 8.11 ) is facilitated by such elements. PTFE lamination is able to function at a continuous temperature of 260 \u00b0C, so the development of a catalyst capable of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with ammonia and simultaneous combustion of VOCs at such a temperature is also useful (ALSOM Power, 2008) . One such innovative catalytic fi lter concept has been reported by Fino and co-workers (2004) . This concept for reduction of NO x and the combustion of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic 8.11 Combining the principles of surface fi ltration and catalysis (reprinted with permission from Mukhopadhyay (2010) hydrocarbons) present in incinerator fl ue gases, was based on a structure combining catalytic foam with a laminated fabric fi lter for fl y-ash fi ltration.",

With average surface areas of around 1000 m 2 /g, the activated carbon surface is very irregular, with pore sizes ranging from 0.5 to 50 nm.

This could be printing, impregnation, applying a chemical binder or thermal bonding resin or spraying fi ne hot-melt fi bers. All technologies have common aims, to keep the surface of the activated carbon as free as possible to enhance the adsorption mechanism and to maximize the loading capacity for gaseous components or odors ( Fig. 8.13 ) (Sievert, 2011) . In a study, sorbent particles (active carbon, aluminium oxide, chitosan, etc.) are caught by microfi bers in meltblown nonwovens. These nonwovens do not contain any additional agent to bind sorbent particles, hence the durability of binding sorbent particles is the key issue in this technology. Organoleptic assessment is useful to determine the durability of active carbon particle bonds in the composite nonwovens. The assessment of one part of a fi ltration face mask made out of composite nonwovens with active carbon showed that sorbent particles had a tendency to drop off (Nowicka, 2003) .",

Several nonwovens are available with a conductive surface to fulfi ll the requirements of static dissipation arising from explosive hazardous applications (Sievert, 2011) . The high resistivity exhibited by the majority of synthetic fi bers makes them a potential source for static build up, which can lead to arcing and explosions. In order to reduce such risks, a range of methods have been employed to increase the conductivity of fi lter media and facilitate the movement of any static build up directly to the ground. Such methods, which have varying degrees of durability, cost, effi ciency, practicality and contamination potential, include the use of epitropic and stainless steel fi ber admixtures, chemical coatings, aluminized coatings, carbon/resin coatings and carbon lines printed on a media. At the time of writing there is a clear market potential for the development of an effi cient, durable, convenient conductive fi ber which can be successfully applied to a wide range of fi ltration applications (Scoble, 2011) .

However, because structures such as those in diapers, hygienic pads, and wipes do not involve an element of separation, they are not considered as fi lter media. Although hydrophobic, polyolefi ns, have an affi nity for oil. As such, they are frequently used to absorb oil from water, for example to control oil spills at sea. It should be noted that absorbency is often an undesired quality affecting a fi lter medium. Cellulose media has a tendency to absorb water, leading to softening and weakening of the fi lter structure and subsequently a reduced fi lter life. Furthermore, fi ltration performance may be inhibited by the fi ber swelling caused by moisture absorption. Air-laid nonwoven structures, largely based on cellulose material, or short staple synthetic fi bers, including polyester, polypropylene, nylon or rayon along with super absorbent polymers (SAP), for example carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), are frequently used for formation of composite structures. Within a composite, fi bers are inherently more effective because of their complementary structure. They also outperform super absorbent powders in handling (Dewsbury, 1990) . If a considerable amount of long synthetic fi bers feature in the web produced, it can then be spunlaced (hydroentangled). The media can be effectively used for different application areas such as water removal from oils and fuels, air fi ltration, blood treatment fi lters and personal protective equipment.",

Cartridges are based either on outside to inside or inside to outside fuel fl ow and offer excellent fi ltration rate capability. The fl ow through the system is halted when hit with a localized slug of water because of super absorbent gel block. Presence of water/solids in the incoming fuel will give rise to an increase in pressure differential, or a decrease in the fl ow rate, as the cartridges reach their maximum capacity for solids, water or a combination of both (Dewsbury, 1990 ).",

In all these improvements, development of the composite fi lter media is of prime importance. Usually, ultrafi ne fi lters such as HEPA and ULPA elements use a sheet form of medium produced with glass microfi bers with a graduated matrix to provide very high dust retention capacities. Nonwoven media, made from progressively structured thermally-(meltblown and spunbonded) and resin-bonded synthetic fi bers, are gaining in use over glass fi ber media. PP melt blown supported by spunbonded material are also used as HEPA fi lters. HEPA fi lter performance is found to be improved through appropriately structured meltblown nonwovens (Hassan et al. , 2012) . There are many other variants of fi lter media composite structure such as the SMS (spunbond/meltblown/spunbond) process and variations thereof. The layered construction enables a gradual removal of fi ner airborne particles. In addition to being less expensive, fi lters exhibit greater durability, performance, safety, and environmental friendliness than their nonwoven glass fi ber counterparts (Thiele and Badt, 1996) . In addition, some designs offer varied separation modes within a single fi lter media. In automotive cabin air fi lters, for example, a nonwoven particulate fi lter layer is often combined with an activated carbon layer, offering further removal of odors and fumes.",

Recently, more and more nanofi ber/bicomponent/meltblown media are combined for particle fi ltration, whether purely mechanical or electrostatically charged or a combination thereof, with the benefi ts of activated carbon. These combined fi lters not only stop particles but also absorb a multitude of gasses and odors. New developments in the manufacturing of nonwoven media containing activated carbon, which tightly encapsulates the carbon particles, now allow manufacturers to easily pleat these media and hence design fi lters for a wide variety of shapes and sizes. By means of activated carbon applied over fl at and even layers on various textiles (Diederich, 2011) odors and VOCs in the automotive interior can be controlled. Different activated carbons can be used according to what substances and how much gas and odor fi ltration are required to be adsorbed. As typical cabin air fi lters cannot catch emissions in the car interior, especially when the car is stationary, car interiors can be made out of the composite containing activated carbon. The increasing public awareness of air quality is expected to move cabin air fi lters into more and more cars, therefore further expanding this market (Barrillon, 2005) . The Hollingsworth & Vose Company, Inc. (2013) promotes adsorptive fi lter media with multilayered structures that remove vapors and gases from the air space. Their media can be combined with almost all particulate fi ltration media and scrims. Ahlstrom products (2013) has designed its Trinetex\u00ae technology for particulate fi ltration of cabin air. This unique technology employs a gradient density effect to increase dirt-holding capacity, through a design consisting of a three-layer wet-laid medium. In order to provide optimized fi ltration effi ciency, mechanical and electrostatic fi ltration are combined, whilst fl ame retardancy and antimicrobial treatments are also available to further enhance the fi lter media.",

A typical engine air fi lter is shown in Fig. 8 .23 . Automotive air fi ltration and heavy duty air fi ltration are the two main air intake fi lter categories for engine powered vehicles, and require media with quite different properties to meet the very different demands of each system. As the automotive air-intake fi lter is frequently exposed to the high temperatures generated by a running engine, heat and temperature resistance are important requirements of the fi lter medium used, whilst additionally being expected to be fl ame retardant in some cases. For such applications the fi lter elements are single use, and once they have come to the end of their useful life they are disposed of.",

Synthetic fi bers may be used to provide reinforcement for applications where higher burst strength and enhanced durability are required, such as for use in military vehicles. Filter media with a nanofi ber coating have also generated much recent interest. These nanofi bers also show very high initial effi ciency compared to standard cellulose media which only achieve their targeted effi ciency level after they have built up a suffi cient dust cake on their surface. However, there are still challenges such as cost, chemical compatibility, durability, nanofi ber layer adhesion and uniformity, and some hazards associated with solvent removal and disposal (Chuanfang, 2012 ). (Hutten, 2007) Within an engine, particle build-up may develop from various different sources. In protecting the engine from the wear and abrasion caused by such contaminants, lubrication oil fi lters ( Fig. 8 .24 ) play a key role. Ensuring oil is suffi ciently clean is key to preventing damage, particularly in areas where the oil operates in the narrow gaps between moving parts (for example at the bearings and annular spaces between the piston and wall). The advent of composite structures for lube oil fi ltration can greatly enhance the performance of an engine. 8.23 Car engine air fi lter.",

The contaminants include particulate matter, moisture, and microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Apart from the particulate fi lter, a separate coalescing fi lter medium can be used for removal of moisture from fuel. The typical coalescing media for the fi lter inlet element is usually a resin-treated wetlaid medium composed of a blend of cellulose fi bers and glass microfi bers. Sometimes synthetic fi ber such as polyester is added for greater fl ex resistance. In fi lters, a fairly hydrophilic fi ber surface is desired that attracts water droplets and holds on to them as they grow in size by being struck by additional droplets. Media treated with phenolic resin generally have the right surface properties for good coalescing and separation effi ciencies. Eventually, the coalesced water particles will be of suffi cient size to be blown off the fi bers by the fl uid stream passing through the medium. Downstream of the medium, the water droplets are of suffi cient size to settle gravimetrically in the settling sump. It is key that the exit element or separator is extremely hydrophobic, rejecting any small water particles entrained in the fuel stream. The addition of very low energy media (such as a fl uorocarbon or silicone) as a coating for the exit elements can enhance this.",
