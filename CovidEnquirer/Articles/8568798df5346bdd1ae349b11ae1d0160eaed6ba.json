The 3 protocol objectives were met: achieving a high rate of timely notifications, identifying and evaluating symptomatic contacts, and using serology to detect transmission. The investigation detected no transmission on any of the conveyances. Concurrent household and healthcare facility contact investigations for these cases also did not identify MERS-CoV transmission (5). At least 8 other aircraft and 2 bus investigations have been reported, totaling >400 evaluated contacts (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Index casepatient symptoms have varied; flight times ranged from 1.5 to 10 hours. Contact definitions ranged from 2 adjacent seats in all directions to the entire plane; most common was within 2 rows of the index case-patient. Several investigations included laboratory testing of symptomatic or asymptomatic contacts. No transmission on aircraft or buses has been documented. Of all passengers 188 (36%) were on the London-Boston flight, 158 (30%) on the Boston-Atlanta flight, and 175 (34%) on the Atlanta-Orlando flight. Domestic passengers were assigned to state health departments for follow-up if contact information indicated they lived in that state. CDC assumed responsibility for interviewing passengers if they lacked contact information that would enable state health department assignment. A total of 337 contacts were interviewed late in the incubation period (days 11-14 after exposure) and were not contacted for a follow-up interview after the incubation period; remaining contacts were interviewed after the incubation period. FPHA were notified for foreign passport holders and US citizens living or traveling abroad. The incubation period for MERS is 2-14 days after exposure. Symptoms compatible with MERS were fever (>38\u00b0C [100.4\u00b0F]), feverishness, symptoms of acute respiratory illness (i.e., cough, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, sore throat), myalgia, malaise, or gastrointestinal symptoms in persons who traveled on the same conveyance as the index casepatient. CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; FPHA, foreign public health authority; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome. Limitations of our investigation included incomplete follow-up, self-reported symptoms, and potential recall bias. Cases may have been missed because a small number of travelers were interviewed or had specimens collected only during the 14-day incubation period.",

Recent publications concluded that aircraft contact tracing required extensive preparation, resources, and passenger compliance; was an inconvenience to passengers; had mixed outcomes (14) ; and caused psychological distress to contacts (12) . Our investigation required substantial resources of airlines, a bus company, local and state health departments, federal agencies, and foreign public health authorities. For future aircraft contact investigations for MERS, CDC will include only passengers seated within 2 rows of the index case-patient, although modifications may be made depending on circumstances. Comprehensive conveyance contact investigations with laboratory evaluation can guide future public health practice for emerging communicable diseases.",

Of all passengers, 78 (88%) were on the London-Chicago flight, 9 (10%) on the Riyadh-London flight, and 2 (2%) on the Riyadh-London and London-Chicago flights. Domestic passengers were assigned to state health departments for follow-up if contact information indicated they lived in that state; CDC assumed responsibility for interviewing passengers if they lacked contact information that would enable state health department assignment. One US citizen was interviewed by CDC while traveling abroad; 1 US citizen with dual citizenship on the Riyadh-London flight was notified by CDC but already had been interviewed by authorities in the country of residence. FPHA notifications were made for foreign passport holders and US citizens living or traveling abroad. The incubation period for MERS is 2-14 days after exposure. Symptoms compatible with MERS were fever (>38\u00b0C [>100.4\u00b0F]), feverishness, symptoms of acute respiratory illness (i.e., cough, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, sore throat), myalgia, malaise or gastrointestinal symptoms 2-14 days after travel on the same conveyance as the index case-patient.

On April 24, he flew from Riyadh to London, UK (Boeing 747-400, flight time 6 h 50 min), then London to Chicago, IL, USA (Boeing 767-300, 8 h 45 min). He then traveled to Indiana by bus (1 h 10 min). On April 27, cough, shortness of breath, increasing fever, and rhinorrhea developed; he was hospitalized April 28. MERS was diagnosed May 1 by the Indiana State Department of Health and confirmed May 2 by CDC (1). Index case-patient 2, unconnected to case-patient 1, was a 43-year-old resident of Saudi Arabia who traveled on 2 international and 2 domestic US flights on May 1. He felt ill on his Riyadh-London flight (Boeing 777-300ER, 6 h 30 min); fever, chills, and myalgia developed on a flight from London to Boston, MA, USA (Boeing 767-400, 7 h 40 min), and cough on the domestic flights: Boston-Atlanta, GA, USA (McDonnell Douglas D-90, 2 h 50 min), and Atlanta-Orlando, FL, USA (Boeing 757, 1 h 30 min). On May 9, he sought care at a Florida emergency department with fever, cough, chills, and myalgia. Bilateral crackles were noted on exam; chest radiograph was normal.
