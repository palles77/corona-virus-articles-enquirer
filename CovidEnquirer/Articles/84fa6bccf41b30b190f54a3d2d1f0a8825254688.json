At least one hundred types of virus may be present although many of these are difficult or even impossible to characterise under these conditions. Wastewater treatment does not greatly effect the survival of many enteric viruses and some survive well even after effluent disposal. The use of disinfectants for the inactivation of virus in effluent is practicable but requires careful manipulation in order to avoid the disemination of byproducts toxic to man or capable of interferring with the ecology of the receiving waters or soils. No one system is likely to be either universally acceptable because of the variable quality of effluents and much research remains to be done before guidelines can be recommended or established.",

Seven years ago Berg (1973) made the point that although it was not easy to remove all viruses from sewage, the technology to do so existed and we should be prepared to pay the cost. It is the object of this brief review to re-examine the practicability of achieving virus-free effluents, a subject recently reviewed by several others in particular, Grabow (1979) , White (1979) and Bitton (1980) . The safe disposal of effluents and the associated sludges can present a major problem to urban communities where the volumes involved may exceed millions of litres each day. Although these products of wastewater treatment are potentially valuable for irrigation and fertilisation of land, they are usually discarded because it is simpler and cheaper . Sludges are frequently dumped in the sea, but may be spread on land where the treatment works are too far from the coast for transportation to be economical. Effluents typically pour into rivers, estuaries or the sea depending on the location of the treatment works, but, where water is scarce,they may be used as an irrigant or even recycled for 146 \u039c. Butler potable supply (Grabow, 1979) .",

The degree of chemical and biological contamination reflects on the origin of the wastewater which may range from purely domestic sewage to principally industrial effluents. Furthermore, the quality of products of wastewater treatment depends on the type of process used which range very widely indeed. The final processing or finishing of effluents and sludges is necessarily different because of their different constitution and this is particularly obvious so far as the removal of viruses is concerned. The removal of viruses from sludges has only relatively recently attracted serious attention (Cliver, 1975; Berg, 1978; Osborn and Hattingh, 1978) but for effluents, various procedures have been adopted for some time, particularly disinfection with chlorine, a treatment now under critical review.",

It'is also possible that certain viruses excreted with the urine could also be present (Utz, 1974) but in general, it is likely that the frequency and pathogenic potential of enteric viruses will be influenced by geographic, seasonal,as well as socioeconomic factors. Most enteric virus infections in developed countries are sporadic and episodic but in developing regions they may well be seriously epidemic. The range of symptoms they may cause include not only gastroenteritis but such divergent clinical features as meningitis, exanthema and even respiratory symptoms (Andrews, Perlera and Wildy, 1978) . Some enteric viruses, for instance poliovirus vaccine strains, may for obvious reasons be regularly isolated from effluent or contaminated waters although apparently not necessarily so even during a vaccination campaign (Katzenelson & Kedmi, 1979) . Of the other common enteric viruses, the echoviruses, the coxsackieviruses, the reoviruses and the adenoviruses many may be isolated throughout the year, but the serotypes may vary from year to year and valuable corroborative data for this has been provided in the U.K., by the Public Health Authority through its weekly and quarterly reports (CDSC, I98O). Unfortunately, several important enteric viruses such as Hepatitis A, the rotaviruses and several so-called 'small round viruses' cannot be readily cultivated in the laboratory (Table 2) and evidence for them depends wholly on clinical or immunological data, or on their visualisation in the electron microscope.",

Undoubtedly, outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been associated with effluentpolluted lake water (CDC, 1979; Denis et al., 1974) and bathing beaches (Cabelli et al., 1979) and many cases of Hepatitis A as well as other enteric virus infections have resulted from the consumption of shell fish harvested from contaminated waters . In general, where epidemiological evidence for gastroenteritis and diarrhoeal diseases has been assembled, it accounts for about half the recorded outbreaks of waterborne diseases (Craun, McCabe and Hughes, 1976) , although in relatively few cases is the aetiological agent identified either by isolation or by serological means. It is however believed that a substantial proportion of these infections could be of viral origin because of the development of symptoms between one and two days after infection and the recovery of the subject within two to three days without significant sequelae.",

Incidentally, it is suggested by some that low levels of infection through the water route may be advantageous to a community by providing it with a relatively harmless mechanism for the circulation of viruses which could otherwise become dangerously epidemic in a largely susceptible population (Mosley, 1967) . It has also been argued (Gamble, 1979 ) that even if the elimination of such low-level transmission of viruses were possible it would be unlikely to have much effect on endemic infection which is commonly by the direct person to person method.

None of these cell cultures is equally sensitive to all the enteric viruses, furthermore, some viruses replicate in them much more slowly than others so that overgrowth of the culture by one virus may occur, a not unlikely event, from an effluent sample which could well be expected to be contaminated with several different viruses. This problem would be less troublesome where the assay for infectivity was the plaque test, but it would be intractable where a quantal assay was employed based on degeneration of the whole culture.",

Another limitation which must be applied to the interpretation of infectivity assays is that cell sensitivity to laboratoryadapted virus and to fresh viral isolates is known to differ, especially to isolates from faecal samples (Madeley, 1979) with which virus in effluents are comparable. These various points highlight the difficulties in developing viral standards for effluent quality where the assay of infectivity is only effective for some, uncertain for others and totally unavailable for those in which we are particularly interested Another constraint on the sensitivity of the infectivity assay relates to the small number of infectious particles which may be present, such that concentration of the sample before isolation may well be essential. Many methods for concentration of viruses from water have been recommended, such as filtration, flocculation or two phase liquid separation, but their value for effluent treatment will be greatly influenced by the effluent quality especially its content of suspended solids. (Seeley and Primrose, 1979) . One particular problem is the concentration of cytotoxic substances which may be difficult to characterise and remove (Glass, Sluis and Yanko, 1978; Schmidt et al., 1978) .",

For bacteria it is generally agreed that certain coliform bacteria may be regarded as representative, but with viruses it is not at all obvious which, if any one type, could be selected. The idea that enteric bacteria could be used as models for enteric viral contamination has been rejected, not only because there is little correlation between the levels found of the two groups, but because many viruses are more resistant to disinfection, which is the usual object of the study (Berg, et al., 1978) . Furthermore, the range of types of enteric viruses which may be present vary widely because, unlike many enteric bacteria, they do not appear to form part of the natural gut flora but occur sporadically. However, it has been frequently suggested that a coliphage,which would be expected to be part of the natural flora, would be suitable indicator of enteric virus pollution (Scarpino, 1975; Kott et al 1974) . The coliphages certainly fulfil a number of recommended prerequisites (Haas, 1977) that they are present whenever their pathogenic hosts are present, they are incapable of regrowth in the effluent, but are at least equally resistant to environmental stress, including disinfection. Furthermore, they are present in large numbers and are readily enumerated. However the selection of a particular coliphage poses a problem, for instance, an obvious contender like the f2 coliphage recommended by Shah and McCabe (1972) is not the only phage to replicate in its specific host Escherichia coli (K-,2Hfr). The use of the less selective \u00a3^ coli \u0392 strain would isolate even more types of coliphages (Kott, et al., 1974) . The deliberate introduction of a phage type unlikely to occur naturally, for example, a phage of Serratia m^rc^seng (Castens and Coetzee, 1965) would be impractical for routine monitoring of effluent treatment, even supposing it had the right properties, like high resistance to disinfectant. To take a phage dependent on a host thought to be commonly present in wastewater treatment like a cyanophage (Smedberg and Cannon, 1976) would only be useful if it occurred reliably and was also very resistant to effluent treatment. Nearly all these studies, as well as those in which a model enterovirus was propsed, suffer from the disadvantages peculiar to such laboratory studies, in that it is not certain how far results can be extrapolated to field conditions.",

            "text": "The degritting and settling procedures carried out during the early stages of sewage treatment lead to an unpredictable dispersion of the virus originally present in the faecal solids. For instance, although a substantial proportion of the solids settle out into the primary sludges there is little apparent loss of infectivity in the settled sewage effluent (Kollins, 1966) presumably due to a break up of vvviral aggregates and floes to release individual infectious virions and the fact that viruses have a strong predeliction to adsorp to solids (Bitton, 1976) accounts for their effective removal during the activated sludge aeration. Indeed, good quality effluents from such treatment should have a very low suspended solids content and a good correlation between low solids content and low viral infectivity of effluents has been observed (Balluz and Butler, 1979) . The absence of solids from effluent is also important because they provide a mechanism for the protection of adsorbed virus against disinfection (Boardman and Sproul, 1977; Hajkal, et al, 1979) Virus in untreated final effluents is ultimately subject to various forms of environmental stress in the receiving waters or soil (Bitton, 1980) , but the fact that virus is readily isolated from effluent polluted river water obviously implies reasonable survival and experimental studies in different types of water provide additional evidence of good survival (Gerba, Wallis and Melnick, 1975) especially in clean (Mehnel et al., 1977) or heavily polluted waters but surprisingly and inexplicably, less so in moderately dirty water (Clarke, et al 1969) . Virus apparently survives less well in sea water (Gerba and Schaiberger, 1975b) indeed there is some evidence that it is specifically inactivated (Fujioka, Loh and Lau, 1980) . Disposal of effluent to land may result in percolation of virus through the soil to contaminate ground water supplies (Schaub and Sorber, 1977) but normally viruses eventually disappear, due to adsorption and ultimately inactivation. .pa The distribution of viruses in soil is known to be strongly influenced by the degree of hydration, the pH, the ionic strength and the organic content of the medium (Akin et al., 1971) . It is clear from all this that the ecology of viruses during wastewater treatment and after the disposal of the products is evidently very complex. Furthermore, it is also worth noting that virions enter the sewage plant discontinuously and in various states of aggregation so that no one sample at any one stage in the process can be taken as representative of anything other than what is present at that time in that sample.",

For effluents, the choice of treatment is limited by the requirement for a high quality final effluent free from harmful by-products. The treatment must be cheap, easy to produce. The disinfection methods available range from the purely physical (Table 3) , to purely chemical (Table 4 ) like the application of the halogen disinfectants. In addition, there is the more complex and interesting application of a combination of one or more of these basic methods.

Of the most commonly applied methods, flocculation with a variety of salts or synthetic polyelectrolytes is probably the most useful, but not all viruses behave in the same way, for instance rotavirus is less efficiently adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide than poliovirus, (Farah et al., 1978) , but in practice such differences might not be important.",

Furthermore, it must be simply and reliably assayed and unreactive with other chemical or physical constituents of the effluent. In this regard, the characterisation of effluent is an important consideration because wide variations in physical and chemical quality are known to occur and are likely to influence the effectiveness of disinfection (Tonelli, 1976) . treatments which result in the removal of virus merely defer the problem of its inactivation, to the treatment of the resultant sludge.",

The most promising developments use ionising (Sinsky, 1977) and non-ionising irradiation (Vajdic, 1970 ) not only alone but in conjunction with chemical methods. The main disadvantages in these methods is that ionising irradiation by gamma rays or high energy electrons, like that with ultraviolet, has poor penetrating power and its effect is greatly diminished by turbidity. However, although expensive in comparison to the application of conventional disinfectants they may, as a result of improved, technology become competitive and acceptable (Singer and Nash ,1979) Heat also would work well but remains impractical for effluents, although applicable to sludges (Ward and Ashley, 1978) where anaerobic digestion results in the development of elevated temperature. However, studies of heat inactivation of viruses in water have, incidently, provided a useful basis for understanding viral inactivation in general. In particular, of the characteristic biphasic inactivation where after treatment there remains a residual of apparently unaffected virus. The influence of pH, divalent cations and redox potential on heat inactivation may also provide some insight into the influence of these factors on chemical disinfection, indeed the action of pH, cations or redox potential alone on viruses should not be ignored (Poynter, Slade & Jones 1973) because both redox potential and pH are both believed to act on viral capsid proteins (Mandel, 1971) which may either alter their sensitivity to disinfectants or their ability to adsorb to sensitive cells.",

There would be, in such examples, a delay in the measured loss even though much virus was actually inactivated. Aggregation could equally explain residual infectivity where infectious particals remained inaccessible to the disinfectant (Broardman and Sproul, 1977) It is also possible that viral populations are genetically heterogenous with respect to sensitivity to disinfection, indeed some studies have resulted in the selection of population with increased resistance (Bates, Shaffer and Sutherland, 1977) but it is also possible that some residual infectivity is the result of multiplicity reactivation (Young and Sharp, 1979) that is the restoration of the complete replication mechanism due to the multiple infection of a cell with virions with differntly but only slightly damaged genomes.

It is important to note that viruses range in their sensitivity (Lund 1964) for instance a laboratory strain of coxsackievirus was the most resistant enterovirus tested and some other enteritis viruses like reovirus and adenovirus were more sensitive than than any of the tested enteroviruses. More interesting is the observation that fresh isolates of enterovirus appeared to be more resistant than laboratory adapted strains (Kelly and Sanderson, 1958, Lui et al 1977) . Furthermore, certain viruses may have resistance selectively induced by cultivation in the presence of chlorine (Bates, Shaffer and Sutherland, 1977) . This observation raised objections to inadequate chlorination (Nupen and Morgan, 1978) because of the possibility that such resistant viruses may, when released in effluent, ultimately replicate in susceptible people.",

Fortuitously, chlorine dioxide does not readily react with nitrogenous compounds although it does experience a demand from phenolic chemicals. It is this property, resulting in the elimination of colour, taste and odour which has attracted much attention (Ingols, 1975) . Its assay in the presence of chlorine is complex but recently a specific spectrophotometric assay has been reported (Knechtel, Janzen and Davis, 1978) which is useful.",

Like chlorine dioxide, it has to be produced in situ but the equipment is simple depending on the convertion of oxygen in an electric arc. However, for accurate and reliable delivery considerable care has to be exercised, and its assay is frought with difficulty because its chemistry in aqueous solution is complex (Peleg, 1976) . Its disinfectant activity probably resides in the hydroxy and oxide radicals (Hoigne and Baden, 1976; Kim, Gentile and Sproul, 198O) but its value also lies in its capacity to react with many organic carbon compounds incidently resulting in the removal of colour, odour and taste, a subject which has been critically reviewed (Kinman, 1975) . It has been shown to be active against a range of viruses (Evison, 1978) and its potential is greatly enhanced by good mixing particularly the application of ultrasound (Dahi, 1975, Burleson, Murray and Pollard, 1975 ) which probably affects not only the bubble size (Farouq, Chian and Engelbrecht, 1977) but may be useful in the break-up of viral aggregates and the release of virus from floe. Its effectiveness has been compared to that of chlorine (Bollyky and Siegel,1077; Wyatt and Wilson, 1979) , but its main disadvantage for effluent is the great demand which has to be met before the formation of the active residual, however there is a complete absence of harmful biproducts.",

Apparent synergism would occur, of course, when the action of one treamtent simply removed a substance capable of blocking or inactivating the other reactant. Examples of this have already been noted, for instance the pretreatment of effluent to make it more suitable for chemical disinfection or the more special case of the value of ultra sound during ozonisation (Dahi, 1976) .A good example of real synergism is demonstrated by the sequential addition of chlorine and chlorine dioxide where the nett disinfection is improved (Tifft et al., 1977) . Usually the advantages of such treatment or equivalent procedures with chlorine and ozone (Ross, van Leeuven and Grabow, 1976; Wyatt and Wilson, 1979) is mainly in the production of a better quality water free from irritating or toxic residuals. True synergism has also been thought to be the result of the combination of monochl or amine and iodine (Kerman and Layton, 1976) and iodine with ozone (Buddie, 1973) .",
