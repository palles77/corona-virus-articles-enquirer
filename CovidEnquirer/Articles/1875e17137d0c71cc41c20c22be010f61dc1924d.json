            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus of the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales (de Groot et al., 2011) , belongs to a group of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that cause diseases in several species, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans or transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs. Despite the high prevalence of FCoV infections in the cat population worldwide, only 5-10% of FCoV-infected cats develop the fatal disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Addie and Jarrett, 1992) . This change of virulence of a harmless FCoV biotype that usually causes no clinical signs into the pathogenic variant is thought to be caused by mutations in the FCoV spike protein gene (Chang et al., 2012; Vennema et al., 1998) . These mutations cause a change in tropism from enterocytes to macrophages, giving FCoV the ability to infect and effectively replicate within cells of the macrophage lineage and cause a lethal systemic disease with multi-organ involvement (Pedersen, 2009) . The median survival time of cats with effusive FIP is only a few days (Ritz et al., 2007) , and the diagnosis of FIP commonly leads to euthanasia, since to date, no treatment has been proven to be effective. Cats with FIP show nonspecific clinical signs such as fever, weight loss and anorexia, often accompanied by body cavity effusions and/or ocular and neurological signs. A definitive diagnosis of FIP ante mortem remains challenging, especially when no body cavity effusions can be detected (Hartmann et al., 2003) . Presently, the gold standard for the diagnosis of FIP is considered to be immunostaining of FCoV antigen in macrophages within tissue lesions, a technique that requires invasive tissue collection (Kipar and Meli, 2014) . In cats with FIP, FCoV can be detected by RT-PCR in cell-free body cavity effusions in more than 80% of the cases, while serum or blood samples often are negative (Doenges et al., 2017) . For both immunostaining and RT-PCR, samples have to be sent to specialized laboratories, resulting in the delay of diagnostic results. This leads to further unnecessary testing for other diseases, to withholding necessary therapy of other treatable diseases, or to delayed euthanasia in cats suffering from severe signs of FIP. Therefore, a fast and simple point of care test would be very beneficial in the diagnostic process.",

A set of four to six primers is used, that form products with self-hybridizing loop structures. By using a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity, no melting or annealing steps are required, and amplification products of different lengths are formed at a constant temperature of 60-65\u00b0C (Nagamine et al., 2002) . Since LAMP reactions only require a simple heat block with constant temperature, and DNA amplification can be detected by fluorescence or color change, the method can be applied for point-of-care diagnostics (Surabattula et al., 2013) .",

In every cat presenting with body cavity effusions, FIP is a potential differential diagnosis. An earlier study showed that FIP is responsible for about 40% of effusions, while most of the remaining cases were caused by malignomas, cardiac insufficiency or purulent serositis (Hirschberger et al., 1995) . The FIP group (n = 34) included cats with a definitive diagnosis of FIP by one or more methods: All effusions of cats with FIP tested positive for FCoV by RT-PCR by a commercial laboratory, and in 26/34 samples putative disease-causing mutations could be detected. The RT-PCR detection method has been described previously (Felten et al., 2017) . In 25/34 cats FIP diagnosis was achieved by post-mortem examination, including full body necropsy with histopathological examination. Diagnosis of FIP was confirmed when typical histologic lesions where detected (surfacebound multi-systemic pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic disease with venulitis with or without high-protein exudate). In 17/25 cats with full body necropsy immunohistological staining for FCoV-antibody was done on tissue sections and returned a positive result. Immunofluorescent staining of FCoV antigen in macrophages of thoracic or abdominal effusion was done in 20/34 cats, and all samples returned a positive result. A summary of the cases in the FIP group can be found in the supplementary Table 1 .",

The use of samples for this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ('Ethikkommission des Zentrums f\u00fcr klinische Tiermedizin'), permission number 32-25-06-2014. Samples were stored at -80\u00b0C in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf Safe-Lock microcentrifuge tube until assayed. All samples were centrifuged for 20 s at 15,000 \u00d7 g. The supernatant of centrifuged thoracic and abdominal fluids was used for RNA extraction. When using fresh fluid samples, omission of the centrifugation step should be considered to include intact cells with a high viral burden (Pedersen et al., 2015) . In thawed samples, cell integrity is lost and cell debris can be removed. Viral RNA was isolated using the commercial ZR Viral RNA KIT\u2122 (Zymo Research Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl aliquots of samples were mixed with a buffer that facilitates viral particle lysis and allows for RNA adsorption onto the matrix of the Zymo-Spin\u2122 Column. Then the RNA was washed and eluted with 15 \u03bcl of RNase free water. Extracted RNA aliquots were stored at \u221280\u00b0C in an Eppendorf 1.5 ml Safe-Lock microcentrifuge tube until further processing.",

Both commercially available reaction mixtures allowed an easy and fast preparation of the amplification reaction.

Detection of positive samples took about half the time with Isothermal Mastermix compared to the PCRun\u2122 Molecular Detection Mix, yet both tests require less than 90 min. The specificity of both methods for the reported sample group was comparable, with 94.6% and 97.3%, respectively. However, false positive results in a test that diagnoses a fatal disease are very critical and should not occur. A cross-reaction of the LAMP-Primers or carry-over contamination might be the cause of these false positive results. However, the negative controls without sample material did not show any indication for carryover contamination and stayed negative in the LAMP assays. Another possibility for false positive results is the detection of FCoV in cats without FIP, since systemic spread of FCoV does occur, but does not inadvertently result in FIP (Porter et al., 2014) . This explanation is not very likely for the three samples of cats without FIP that were positive by RT-LAMP, since all three were negative by RT-PCR. The sensitivity of the PCRun\u2122 Molecular Detection Mix was superior for the reported sample group with 58.8% compared to 35.3% of the Isothermal Mastermix, using the same primers and PCR conditions.",

            "text": "Since the samples for the RT-PCR and for the RT-LAMP had the same preanalytical treatment (frozen, thawed, and centrifuged), the results can be directly compared and showed that the RT-PCR for FCoV performed much better than the RT-LAMP in our sample group. This is in agreement with a study on other coronaviruses, where RT-LAMP also exhibited a lower analytical sensitivity compared to RT-PCR (Bhadra et al., 2015) . False negative results can occur in samples with a lower viral burden. The FCoV viral load determined by RT-PCR in effusions has been found to be quite low in some samples of FIP-suspected cats (Lorusso et al., 2017) . In our study, the results for RT-PCR were only returned as 'positive' or 'negative' without quantification, leaving open the question whether only effusions with a high viral load resulted in a positive RT-LAMP detection. Another possible reason for the lack of sensitivity might be that sequences of current FCoV strains show sequence variations compared to the sequences deposited in the GenBank database, which were used to design the RT-LAMP primers. Although the primers were chosen to bind in highly conserved regions, variations can occur, which might impair binding and eventually lead to low or no amplification, resulting in poor sensitivity. Reliable primers for RT-PCR target the 3\u2032 UTR of the FCoV sequence, but the RT-LAMP primers that were suggested by the PrimerExplorer software in this region included more sequence differences than the M region that we selected. Modifications of the primers might enhance binding and improve sensitivity. Two studies on LAMP-based identification of FCoV have been published to date. A study from Thailand tested 63 samples of body cavity effusions from cats that were suspected to have FIP both by RT-PCR and by RT-LAMP. More samples tested positive with the RT-LAMP than with the RT-PCR (44% vs. 38%) (Techangamsuwan et al., 2013) . However, the inclusion criteria for cats to be suspected of having FIP were not described in that study. Their control samples consisted of plasma and fecal samples from healthy cats without any contact to other cats. The samples from this healthy control group also had more positive results by RT-LAMP than by RT-PCR (50% vs 30%). The authors mention high rates of false positives in the negative controls (no template controls) when using RT-LAMP, so it remains unclear whether their RT-PCR was less sensitive or their RT-LAMP was prone to unspecific amplification. In the second study, different sample types of cats with a clinical suspicion of FIP and fecal samples for screening for FCoV-shedding cats were tested (Stranieri et al., 2017) . In most sample types, including effusions, their RT-PCR had about twice as many positive results as their RT-LAMP, and none of the RT-PCR-negative samples was positive in the RT-LAMP method. In agreement with our findings, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP appears to be inferior to the RT-PCR. For detection of amplification, both studies used gel electrophoresis and one study (Stranieri et al., 2017) additionally used detection of color change from violet to blue with hydroxynaphtol blue. While gel electrophoresis is quite time-consuming, the color change can be difficult to detect in samples with low amplification. Amplification detection with fluorescence or luminescence as used in the present study is preferable, since the results can be read immediately and could be easily converted to a quantitative format with a standard curve. As a perspective for the future, RT-LAMP reactions for virus detection could be run on new devices that integrate nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection in a miniature format to achieve a true point-ofcare diagnosis (Stumpf et al., 2016) .",
