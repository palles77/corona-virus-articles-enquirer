The study coordinator contacted parents twice a week (by telephone or email) to ask about the presence of any signs or symptoms of respiratory tract illness. Respiratory signs and symptoms were defi ned as coryza (rhinorrhea or nasal congestion), sore throat, ear ache with or without ear discharge, cough, sputum production or dyspnea, in the presence or absence of fever (>38\u00b0C). Every 2 weeks, samples for virus detection were collected regardless of any respiratory symptoms. A sample was defi ned as asymptomatic if the child had no respiratory symptoms 1 full week before and 1 full week after sampling. A sample was defi ned as symptomatic if the child had any respiratory symptoms 1 week before and 1 week after sampling. Parents collected the samples for virus detection by rubbing 1 nostril and posterior oropharynx of their child with separate cotton-tipped swabs. Feasibility of virus sampling by the parents has been described earlier (9) . The study was approved by the local medical ethics committee, and the parents gave written informed consent.",

            "text": "Because latent infections with subsequent asymptomatic reactivation are described as a feature of the polyomaviruses BK and JC (12), we were interested in the longitudinal course of WUPyV and KIPyV infections. Because most previous studies have a cross-sectional design, reinfections and persistence of WUPyV and KIPyV are usually missed. One study reported that WUPyV was detected in sequential samples of 2 immunocompromised patients for 6-8 weeks; 1 child was 16 months and the other 4 years of age (5) . In the present study, positive episodes of WUPyV were interrupted by intervals during which no virus was detected in some children; however, the low viral load in these samples (high cycle threshold values) may have been below the detection limit in these negative intervals. In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that poor collection techniques of samples with low viral loads resulted in failure to detect WUPyV.",

However, these positive samples could also represent new infections of WUPyV and KIPyV. Genetic analysis is needed to investigate whether this observed persistence is actual persistence or whether it represents new infections with different WUPyV and KIPyV subtypes. We conclude that WUPyV and KIPyV are frequently present in young children. Additional studies are needed to confi rm the suggestion from this study that both viruses may be associated with respiratory disease.",
