Spodqteru frugiperda cells infected with this recombinant virus produced a large amount of HN glycoprotein similar to the authentic HN in size. The recombinant HN glycoprotein was localized on the surface of the infected cells and conserved its haemadsorption and neuraminidase activities. The antigenic properties of the recombinant HN glycoprotein seemed to be slightly different from the authentic one, as judging by the reactivity with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific to the antigenic sites responsible for neutralization of viral infectivity. Chickens inoculated with the cells infected with the recombinant virus developed haemagglutination-inhibition and virus neutralization antibodies, and were completely protected from the NDV challenge.",

The cDNAs encoding HN glycoproteins of some NDV strains have been cloned and the nucleotide sequences were determined (Miller et al., 1986; Jorgensen et al., 1987; Gotoh et al., 1988; Schaper et al., 1988) . The nucleotide sequence of cDNA-encoding the HN glycoprotein of Miyadera strain predicts a polypeptide of 571 amino acids with a molecular weight (mol. wt.) of 62,529 and with five possible N-linked glycosylation sites. Antibodies to HN glycoprotein of NDV were reported to have high virus-neutralizing activity (Nishikawa et al., 1983 , Umino et al., 1984 , and passive immunization of anti-HN polyclonal antibodies prolonged significantly the survival periods of NDV-infected chickens (Umino et al., 1987) . Moreover, studies with human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) showed that immunization with HN glycoprotein of PIV3 reduced the virus recovery from PIV3-infected animals (Spriggs et al., 1987; Van Wyke Coelingh et al., 1987; Spriggs et al., 1988) . However, to assess the importance of immune response to HN glycoprotein in the protection and the potential effectiveness of HN glycoprotein as a component vaccine against NDV infection, a large amount of HN glycoprotein without contamination of other NDV component is required. Therefore, we sought to express the HN glycoprotein of NDV using insect baculovirus vector of Autogrupha californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) to obtain sufficient amounts of the native HN glycoprotein. We chose the AcNPV vector because of its success in high level expression of many foreign genes and its potential of post-translational modification such as glycosylation (Matsuura et al., 1987 (Matsuura et al., , 1988 Van Wyke Coelingh et al., 1987; Luckow and Summers, 1988; Kuroda et al., 1990) . Although, Nagy et al. (1990) recently reported the results of successful expression of HN glycoprotein of NDV which is apparently authentic in its molecular property by a recombinant AcNPV, the detailed antigenic property and protective effect of the recombinant HN in vivo were still not examined.",

            "text": "We constructed a recombinant AcNPV which expresses HN glycoprotein of NDV and examined functional and immunological properties of the expressed protein. The expressed protein had the same mobility on SDS-PAGE as the authentic HN glycoprotein, and TM treatment reduced the apparent mol. wt. of the expressed protein to the mol. wt. of unglycosylated HN protein which is calculated from the nucleotide sequence. These results indicated that the expressed HN glycoprotein in the insect cells infected with the recombinant AcNPV was glycosylated. These observations are similar to the previous ones by Nagy et al. (1990) . In many cases, including HN glycoprotein of PIV3, foreign glycoproteins expressed by recombinant AcNPVs were glycosylated (Matsuura et al., 1987; 1989; Van Wyke Coelingh et al., 1987; Yoden et al., 1989; Kuroda et al., 1990) .",

Judging from the reactivities of the representative mAbs, the HN glycoprotein expressed by the recombinant AcNPV conserves three (I, II and III) of four antigenic sites related to virus neutralization. Among the antigenic sites, the site I was shown to be conserved within a wide range of NDV strains and was considered to be immunodominant (Nishikawa et al., 1986) . Moreover, mAb to site I was reported to have high HI and virus neutralizing activities (Nishikawa et al., 1986) . The conservation of the site I on the recombinant HN glycoprotein may contribute to the production of virus neutralizing antibodies in birds inoculated with the recombinant HN glycoprotein, although Iorio and Bratt (1984) reported that all of the antibodies to four antigenic sites on HN glycoprotein are required for complete neutralization of NDV infectivity. Actually, chickens inoculated with the cells expressing the recombinant HN glycoprotein produced antibodies that inhibit the haema~lutination and neutralize the inf~tivity of NDV. Further, in the preliminary study of protection, the chickens were completely protected from the NDV challenge by the immunization with the recombinant HN. Spriggs et al. (1987 Spriggs et al. ( , 1988 reported that a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HN glycoprotein of PIV3 elicited more protective immune response than that expressing F protein of PIV3 in inoculated animals. Considering together, the HN glycoprotein expressed in insect cells is thought to be a good candidate for a component vaccine against NDV infection, although in a study with PIV3, immunization of both HN and F proteins is required to provide a significant level of protection (Ray et al., 1988) .",
