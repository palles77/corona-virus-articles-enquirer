The lipid bilayer is derived from host cell membranes during the process of virus assembly and budding. Consequently, infection of host cells requires that enveloped viruses fuse their membrane with cellular membranes to release the nucleocapsid and accessory proteins into the host cell in order to establish a new infectious cycle. Glycoproteins from enveloped viruses evolved to combine two main features. Firstly, they contain a receptor-binding function, which attaches the virus to the host cell. Secondly, they include a fusion protein function that can be activated to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Both tasks can be encoded by a single glycoprotein or by separate glycoproteins, which act in concert.",

According to this view, fusion of two lipid bilayers in an aqueous environment requires that they come into close contact associated with a significant energy barrier. This process involves local membrane bending creating a first site of contact. Complete dehydration of the initial contact site induces monolayer rupture that allows mixing of lipids from the two outer leaflets, resulting in a hemifusion stalk. In a next step, the model predicts that radial expansion of the stalk leads to either direct fusion pore opening or to the formation of another intermediate, the hemifusion diaphragm, an extended bilayer connecting both membranes. The hemifusion diaphragm may also expand into a fusion pore. Fusion pore formation, which is characterized by an initial opening and closing ('flickering') of the pore may be mediated by several factors such as lateral tension in the hemifusion stalk or bilayer and the curvature at the edges of the hemifusion state. Finally the fusion pore extends laterally until both membranes form a new extended lipid bilayer ( Figure 1) .",

Labeling techniques allow to distinguish between merging of lipid bilayers and content mixing thus visualizing intermediate steps in membrane fusion. This has been applied to several liposome fusion systems demonstrating that membrane fusion steps can be arrested at different stages. Furthermore, certain lipids such as inverted coneshaped lysophospholipids induce spontaneous positive bilayer curvature and inhibit hemifusion, while coneshaped phosphatidylethanolamines induce negative curvature and promote hemifusion. In contrast, the lipid effect on the opening of the fusion pore is the opposite.

This produces a receptor-binding subunit that is either covalently or noncovalently attached to the membrane fusion protein subunit, which anchors the heterotrimer to the viral membrane. The endoproteolytic cleavage positions a hydrophobic fusion peptide at or close to the N-terminus of the fusion domain. Subtilisin-like proteases recognize a conserved multibasic recognition sequence R-X-K/R-R or a monobasic cleavage site present in various glycoproteins. The nature of the cleavage site and its efficient cleavage (e.g., influenza virus hemagglutinin) has been associated with pathogenicity. The multibasic recognition sequences present in influenza virus HA, SV5 F protein, HIV-1 gp160, and Ebola virus GP lead to mostly intracellular processing, whereas monobasic cleavage sites in Sendai virus F protein or influenza virus HA are efficiently cleaved extracellularly, resulting in a more tissuerestricted distribution of these viruses.",

The HA 1 domain, which contains the receptor-binding domain, folds into a beta structure that binds sialic acid-containing cellular receptors at the top of the molecule. In addition, both N-and C-termini of HA 1 interact with the stem of fusion domain HA 2 in an extended conformation. HA 2 anchors hemagglutinin to the viral membrane and folds into a central triplestranded coiled-coil structure that is followed by a loop region and an antiparallel helix, which extends towards the N-terminal fusion peptide that is buried within the trimer interface ( Figure 2 ). The structure of uncleaved influenza virus HA 0 shows that only 19 residues around the cleavage site are in a conformation, which is different from the one seen in the native cleaved HA structure. This difference entails an outward projection of the last residues of HA 1 (323-328) and the N-terminal residues of HA 2 (1-12), resulting in the exposure of the proteolytic cleavage site ( Figure 2 ). Upon cleavage, HA 2 residues 1-10 fill a mostly negatively charged cavity adjacent to the cleavage site, which leads to the sequestering of the fusion peptide within the trimeric structure ( Figure 2 ).",

(1) . The complete refolding process is thought to pull the two membranes into close-enough proximity to concomitantly allow membrane fusion. The extensive rearrangement of the fusion protein is thought to control the formation of different intermediate bilayer structures such as the hemifusion stalk ( Figure 5 (d)), and or the hemifusion diaphragm, followed by fusion pore opening and expansion ( Figure 5 (e)). It is generally assumed that membrane fusion occurs while the helical hairpin structure is formed and the core fusion protein structures represent postfusion conformations. Refolding of the fusion protein might produce defined stable intermediate structures, as suggested by the two low pH structures of influenza virus HA 2 . One indicates that most of the outer layer has not yet zipped up to form the hairpin structure ( Figure 3 , middle panel: the C-terminal ends could extend back to the transmembrane region), while the other one reveals the extended conformation of the outer layer which forms together with the N-terminal coiled-coil a stable N-capped structure (Figure 3 , right panel). Stepwise refolding may thus lock the fusion process irreversibly at distinct steps in agreement with a general irreversibility of class I-mediated fusion processes. The two membrane anchors, which are not present in the fusion conformation structures, also play an active role in the fusion reaction. Replacement of the transmembrane region by a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor leads to a hemifusion phenotype in case of hemagglutinin-driven membrane fusion, highlighting the role of the transmembrane region. Furthermore the C-terminal membrane proximal region plays an important role in fusion as shown in the case of HIV-1 gp41-mediated fusion.",

NMR studies on the isolated influenza virus hemagglutinin fusion peptide revealed a kinked helical arrangement, which was suggested to insert into one lipid bilayer leaflet. This mode of bilayer interaction was proposed not only to mediate membrane attachment but also to destabilize the lipid bilayer.

Domain II harbors the fusion loop that is stabilized by a disulfide bridge and mostly sequestered within the antiparallel flavivirus E glycoprotein homodimer.

This rearrangement produces a hairpinlike structure with a similar functional architecture as class I fusion proteins (Figure 6, upper panel) . The outside of the trimer reveals a groove that was suggested to accommodate the segment, which connects to the transmembrane anchor and thus positions the fusion loops next to the membrane anchors. One significant difference between the TBE E and SFV E1 low pH conformations are the orientations of the fusion loops. TBE E fusion loops undergo homotrimer interactions, while SFV E1 fusion loops do not interact within trimers ( Figure 6 ).",

The low-pH structures indicate that only hydrophobic side chains of the loop insert into the hydrocarbon chains of the outer leaflet of a target membrane. This is sufficient to anchor the fusion protein to the host cell membrane. Further oligomerization of fusion loops, as shown in the case of the low pH form of SFV E1, where crystal packing analysis revealed fusion loop interactions between trimers, was suggested to induce local membrane deformation, such as induction of a nipple-like membrane deformation (Figure 7(c) ). This has been predicted in the stalk model to play an important role in the generation of lipidic intermediates during membrane fusion. Therefore the SFV E1 conformation might reflect an intermediate fusion state preceding the suggested postfusion conformation of flavivirus E trimers with homotrimeric fusion loop interactions. In vivo, the latter conformation might be induced by the final refolding of the C-terminal membrane proximal region and thus determining 'open' and 'closed' conformations of SFV E1 trimers and TBE virus E trimers, respectively ( Figure 6 ).",

The E protein lattice on liposomes contains preferentially rings of five, which seems to affect the curvature of coated liposomes. In contrast rings of six form mostly flat hexagonal arrays in vitro.
