            "text": "including HIV. Although daily antiviral therapy against HSV-2 reduces viral replication and visible lesions, the persistent mucosal inflammation of the human skin samples, including upregulation of the HIV coreceptors DC-SIGN and CCR5, may partly explain the inability of the therapy to reduce acquisition of HIV. 3 5 Disruption of the male foreskin epithelial barrier is an important risk factor for viral entry during sexual intercourse. The foreskin mucosa is, thus, a highly relevant site for investigating viral transmission, especially in the context of a representative study population of young men living in an HIV endemic region. The male foreskin consists of a keratinised stratified epithelial layer and the epithelial cells express a number of tight junction and adhesion proteins that together form a functional barrier against invading pathogens. [6] [7] [8] This barrier function can easily be disrupted during mucosal inflammation. In human skin, the tight junction complex has three major transmembrane proteins identified as claudin, occludin and junctional adhesion molecules. E-cadherin is a major adhesion protein and is expressed on the basal side of the tight junction protein complex. Among these protein families, claudin-1, occludin and E-cadherin have been identified in foreskin keratinocytes and foreskin tissue. 6 7 9 Pathogens often use these specific epithelial intercellular junction proteins as a means of entry. In human skin, HSV infects keratinocytes through a complex interaction involving the protein nectin-1. 10 Reduction of the expression of another junction protein, claudin-1, is associated with enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in patients with atopic dermatitis. 11 HIV can be sexually transmitted, and the male and female genital tract mucosa is an important site of viral entry. Once HIV has crossed the genital epithelial barrier the virus mainly replicates in submucosal CD4+ T cells and the infection is then further spread to regional lymphnodes and the systemic circulation. 12 Thus, an inflammatory milieu, defined by increased expression of specific chemokines and other proinflammatory molecules, results in recruitment of CD4+ T cells and an increased risk of systemic HIV infection. We here hypothesize that HSV-2 seropositivity is associated with genital mucosal inflammation and a disrupted epithelial barrier, even in asymptomatic individuals. This may theoretically contribute to the higher susceptibility of HIV infection that has been observed in HSV-2 seropositive individuals.",

However, the mRNA expression of claudin-1 was significantly lower in the samples of HSV-2 seropositive than HSV-2 seronegative men. The foreskin tissues were collected during a randomised clinical trial of circumcision and the samples had been stratified for HSV-2 serostatus and matched by age of participant. The study individuals had, according to the enrolment criteria, not had any visible or laboratory confirmed genital lesions prior to sample collection. Subclinical and clinical inflammation is usually characterised by increased expression of cytokines, influx of inflammatory cells and partial disruption of the epithelial barrier as defined by downregulation of epithelial junction proteins. These parameters were, therefore, assessed at the molecular level by measurement of mRNA expression with a panel of such immune markers. Immunofluorescent staining of the epithelial junction proteins showed the localisation of the proteins E-cadherin, ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin in the foreskin tissue samples. The distribution over the entire epithelial surface of the samples was irregular, with areas of thick surface interspersed with thin, positively stained cell layers as well as differences in staining intensity. It was, therefore, not possible to standardise quantification at the protein level and hence, we relied on mRNA expression as our read out. The correlation between mRNA and protein expression of these specific epithelial markers has also been evaluated in a study of virus infection of human epithelial cells showing comparable expression levels. 15 Epithelial junction proteins are highly dynamic and paracellular permeability can be affected by various virus infections, including rhinovirus, acute respiratory coronavirus, influenza, West Nile and ebola viruses. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In the case of West Nile virus, the viral capsid degrades claudin proteins, 18 and infection of epithelial and endothelial cells causes endocytosis of a subset of tight junction proteins, including claudin-1. 20 Claudin-1 is also involved in dengue virus and hepatitis C virus entry. 21 22 Genetic variants of CLDN1 may further alter susceptibility to HCV infection 23 and contribute to atopic dermatitis. 11 Since reductions in claudin-1 expression can enhance susceptibility to HSV-1 infections in atopic dermatitis, 11 this implicates tight junctions as a critical barrier structure important in containing the spread of epidermal HSV-1 infections. Thus, the lower claudin-1 mRNA expression seen in the HSV-2 seropositive group in the present study is reminiscent of the claudin-1 reduction and enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1 as described above. Altered expression levels of claudin-1 may also affect susceptibility to other genital infections since it represents a more fragile epithelial barrier status. However, this could not be assessed in the present study since men with symptomatic or laboratory-confirmed genital infections were not eligible for circumcision.",

Neither do the results exclude HSV-2 associated longstanding effects on other immune responses as previously described. 3 4 25 In future longitudinal studies we plan to evaluate whether claudin-1 is persistently downregulated following HSV-2 lesions. The present cross-sectional study format does not allow assessment of the temporal role of HSV-2 for the reduction of claudin-1 mRNA expression. The study participants may also have had a prior (genetic or induced) defect in claudin-1 expression which increased their HSV-2 susceptibility. The men in the present study were sexually active and living in an HIV endemic geographical area and we have thus demonstrated that their HSV-2 serostatus was not associated with general mucosal inflammation at the foreskin tissue level. The association between HSV-2 seropositivity and a lower claudin-1 mRNA expression warrants further studies, since a specific defect of the genital mucosal barrier in a highly vulnerable and relevant population could be of significance. A less robust genital epithelial barrier in HSV-2 seropositive men would be a pathogenic factor by facilitating entrance of STIs, including HIV. Topical compounds strengthening the epithelial layer are an interesting prophylactic approach to lower sexual transmission and acquisition of genital infections. ",

The figure is a representative image of the sample collection. The images to the right are magnifications of the marked area in the picture to the left. The left image was collected with a 5\u00d7 objective (scale bar=500 \u00b5m) and the images to the right with a 40\u00d7 objective (scale bar=50 \u00b5m).
