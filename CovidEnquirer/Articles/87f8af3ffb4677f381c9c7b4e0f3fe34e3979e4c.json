            "text": "As China's industrialization and urbanization have grown rapidly in recent years, China's CO 2 emissions rose from 3405.1799 Mt to 10,249.4630 Mt from 2000 to 2013, and it has reached the highest levels in the word since 2006. Chinese government has emphasized the importance of reducing carbon emissions and set the target of reducing carbon intensity to 60e65% of 2005 levels by 2030. Investigating the convergence of carbon intensity can identify the convergence rate, which is helpful in guiding allocations of carbon intensity reduction. The Yangtze River Delta is one of the key carbon emission regions in China, with higher urbanization levels and larger carbon emissions; thus, we employed prefecture-level panel data derived from grid data between 2000 and 2010 to examine whether the convergence of carbon intensity exists across prefecture-level cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Spatial panel data models were utilized to investigate b-convergence of carbon intensity. The results indicated that carbon intensity showed divergence during 2002e2004 and s-convergence over other periods (2000e2002 and 2004 e2010). Carbon intensity exhibited stochastic convergence, indicating that the shocks to carbon intensity relative to the average level of carbon intensity are only transitory. There was a spatial spillover effect and b-convergence of carbon intensity, suggesting that prefecture-level cities with higher carbon intensity would decrease rapidly in the Yangtze River Delta. Our results highlight the importance of considering the present state of carbon intensity, spatial factors, and socioeconomic factors such as industrial structure and economic levels during allocation planning for reducing carbon intensity.",

            "text": "Carbon dioxide is one of the key greenhouse gases causing global warming; most world governments have recognized the risk of global warming and urgency for carbon reduction. With rapid industrialization and urbanization, China's CO 2 emissions were 3405.1799 Mt in 2000, and it increased rapidly with the average growth rate of 8.2% from 2000 to 2013. China's CO 2 emissions are at their highest since 2006 (Gregg, Andres, & Marland, 2008) . During the same period of 2000e2013, China's contribution to global carbon emissions rose from 13.7% to 28.6% ( Fig. 1 ) (World Bank, 2016) . To mitigate carbon emissions and global warming, China has made different environmental policies and taken effective measures (Li & Lin, 2016; Wu, Wu, Guo, & Cheong, 2016) . In particular, China has raised a target of decreasing carbon intensity (CO 2 emissions divided by gross domestic product (GDP)) to 40e45% of 2005 levels by 2020 Qiu, 2009 ). In the Twelfth Five-Year (2011e2015) Plan drafted by China's State Council, the target of carbon emission were allocated to the provinces for the first time (Hao, Liao, & Wei, 2015a) . China pledged that the peak of CO 2 emissions would achieve around 2030, carbon intensity would decline to 60%e65% of 2005 levels by 2030 in China (National Development and Reform Commission of China, 2015) . The allocation of carbon emission reductions has attracted the attention of scholars (Liao, Zhu, & Shi, 2015; Yu, Wei, & Wang, 2014; Zhang, Wang, & Da, 2014) , but there are relatively few studies from the perspective of convergence for carbon intensity (Hao et al., 2015a; Wang, Zhang, Huang, & Cai, 2014b) . Many climate policies assume that there is convergence (McKibbin & Stegman, 2005; McKibbin, Pearce, & Stegman, 2007; Pettersson, Maddison, Acar, & S\u20ac oderholm, 2014) . The convergence of carbon intensity can provide an important reference for the equal allocation of carbon intensity targets and contribute to the projections of carbon intensity (McKibbin & Stegman, 2005; Pettersson et al., 2014) . Meanwhile, the existing convergence of carbon intensity is helpful to make better environmental policies and it is a necessary condition to achieve the peak of carbon emission (Jobert, Karanfil, & Tykhonenko, 2010; McKibbin & Stegman, 2005) . Analyzing the convergence of carbon intensity is helpful to cognize the change mechanism of carbon intensity and to set evidence-based policies for carbon intensity targets. Convergence of carbon intensity is of particular concern to policymakers in China, and government establishes some important targets of decreasing carbon intensity (Li & Lin, 2016; Wu et al., 2016) . Instead of equal allocation of carbon intensity to each province, the allocation of carbon intensity to prefecture-level city can be more effective (Wu et al., 2016) . Therefore, investigation of the convergence of carbon intensity is important for policymakers to provide suggestions in allocating carbon intensity targets according to carbon intensity rules. Solow (1956) first proposed the theory of convergence in 1956, which has become important in modern economic growth research (Hao, Zhang, Zhong, & Li, 2015b) . To our knowledge, Strazicich and List (2003) probably made the first attempt to test the conditional and stochastic convergence in 21 industrial countries during the period of 1960e1997 and found that there was significant convergence. Pettersson et al. (2014) reviewed the development literature of the convergence. The research on the scale of carbon convergence mainly focuses on countries (Fallahi & Voia, 2015; Jobert et al., 2010; McKitrick & Wood, 2013; Ord as Criado & Grether, 2011) or provinces (Hao et al., 2015a; Yang, Zhang, Sheng, & Shackman, 2016) . For example, Ord as Criado and Grether (2011) investigated the convergence of per capita CO 2 in 166 world areas during 1960e2000 and found that there were different convergence states during different periods. Wang and Zhang (2014) investigated the convergence of CO 2 in China's six sectors in provincial level during 1996e2010 and found that there was convergence in these sectors.",

Bayesian shrinkage estimation (BSE) was applied by Jobert et al. (2010) to examined the convergence of CO 2 emissions during 1971e2006 and they found that there was absolute convergence. Semi-parametric and non-parametric models were employed to investigate the convergence of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides in 25 European countries during 1980e2005 (Ord as Criado, Valente, & Stengos, 2011). The log t test was used by Wang et al. (2014b) to verify the convergence of carbon intensity in China during 1995e2011 and they found that there was divergence at the national level but convergence at the provincial level. Spatial lag model (SLM) was utilized by Huang and Meng (2013) to investigate CO 2 emissions convergence and they found that the convergence rate showed an increasing trend when considering spatial effects. Spatial autoregressive (SAR) model and spatial error model (SEM) was used by Yu (2012) to verify the convergence of Chinese energy intensity and the result showed absolute b-convergence across provinces.",

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the convergence of carbon intensity across prefecture-level cities using grid data in the YRD. Compared with provincial data, prefecturelevel city data can provide more accurate and detailed results; meanwhile, prefecture-level cities are the main source of carbon emissions. In addition, we investigate the convergence of carbon intensity rather than carbon emissions per capita, which can better assist policymakers in allocating the reduction targets of carbon emissions. Furthermore, we consider spatial spillover effects and spatial dependence, utilizing spatial econometric models that examine b-convergence, better simulating the actual values.",

The CO 2 emissions were calculated based on production, mainly including energy industry, transformation non-energy use, combustion in manufacturing industry, international and domestic aviation, road transportation, non-road ground transport, international and domestic shipping, energy for buildings, fugitive from solid, oil production and refineries, non-metallic mineral processes, chemical processes solvents, metal processes, agricultural soils, large scale biomass burning, solid waste disposal and fossil fuel fires (European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) & Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), 2013).

When the value of b is significantly negative, this indicates that there is b-convergence of carbon intensity across prefecture-level cities in the YRD . Referring literatures, we chose GDP per capita (the ratio of GDP to population in each prefecture-level city) (PGDP) (Zhu et al., 2014) , industrial structure (GDP from second industry divided by total GDP in each prefecture-level city) (IS) (Guan et al., 2014) and population density (the population divided by the area of each prefecture-level city) (PD) (Strazicich & List, 2003) as control variables to investigate the conditional b-convergence of carbon intensity. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics of all related variables. GDP per capita is taken as a representation of economic development level, as it has an important impact on carbon intensity (Zhao, Burnett, & Fletcher, 2014) . Wang, Zhang, and Liu (2016b) found the more developed prefecture-level city the more likely to reduce carbon intensity in China. The secondary industry is the main source of CO 2 emissions, and thus the higher the proportion of the secondary industry's value in GDP, the more difficult to reduce carbon intensity (Hao et al., 2015a) . The population factor is usually utilized to analyze carbon emissions, but there is a variable relationship between population density and carbon intensity. Zhao et al. (2014) suggested that increasing population density would reduce carbon intensity. Hao et al. (2015b) proposed that higher population density may increase the degree of industrialization, which causes higher carbon intensity.

Therefore, the SEM is more suitable, while the spatial Durbin model (SDM) should be considered (LeSage & Pace, 2009). The SDM can be simplified to the SLM or the SEM (Burridge, 1981) . The Wald test is 0.0502, and the p value is 0.8227, indicating that the SEM is more suitable (Burridge, 1981) . Thus, we employ the SEM with spatial fixed effects to investigate the absolute b-convergence. According to the same methods, we choose the SLM with spatial fixed effects to investigate the conditional b-convergence.",

Chinese government executed stricter energy policies in the Tenth Five-Year Plan Period (2000e2005) by adjusting the energy and industrial structures (Yuan & Zuo, 2011) . Land use change, particular farmland converted to settlement and industry parks, also change the carbon emission in the YRD (Lai et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015) . With the effective measures, carbon intensity presented a downward trend during 2000e2002 and 2004e2010 (Fig. 5) . Carbon intensity showed an increasing trend in 2003, 2004 and 2008 . Domestic and international events may affect the trends. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broke out in China, causing a serious impact on human health and economic activities, the effects of which continued into the following year (Zhong et al., 2003) . In 2008, a global financial crisis engulfed the world (Lu, Yang, Huang, Chuai, & Wu, 2015; Wu et al., 2015) with serious impacts on social and economic development in the YRD. The YRD has a processing trade development model in the low added value segment of high-end products (labor-intensive areas, low valueadded sectors), both low efficiency and high risk (Chen, 2007) . It is easily affected by global economic fluctuations, as a decrease in external demand leads to a substantial decrease in exports. Internal and external factors change economic development, which cause the change of carbon intensity. China executed a series of measures to address the global financial crisis; the \"four trillion plan\" was implemented by the Chinese government in 2008 (Chen, Pan, Wang, & Shen, 2016) , and industrial transformation and upgrading was executed in the YRD, which pulled economic development out of the trough (Liu & Li, 2015) .",

This is perhaps the result of differences in factors effecting carbon intensity, such as decreases in technical levels, economic levels and industrial structure. Therefore, the prefecture-level cities with higher initial carbon intensity should allocate higher carbon intensity reduction targets (Hao et al., 2015b) , such as in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. According to the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, the targets of carbon intensity reduction (Table 3) , are 18% and 19% in Yangzhou and Jinhua.

When the reduction tasks of carbon intensity are allocated to different prefecture-level cities with alike carbon intensity, policymakers should also consider the influence of industrial structure, GDP per capita and spatial factors. The higher of the proportion of the second industry, the larger of the carbon intensity, and the more tasks of carbon intensity reduction should be allocated. The higher the economic level is, the more people may concern with the environment quality (Hao, Chen, Wei, & Li, 2016; Hao et al., 2015b; Li & Lin, 2015) , and the more capital can be used to reduce carbon intensity.

The decreasing annual growth rate of carbon intensity in prefecture-level cities is helpful in decreasing the annual growth rate of carbon intensity in neighboring prefecture-level cities. Meanwhile, the SEM considering spatial factors increases the convergence speed of carbon intensity from 0.0789 to 0.0912, suggesting that considering spatial factors accelerates the convergence rate. The results are similar to the finding of Zhao, Wesley Burnett, and Lacombe (2015) . It is important for policymakers to consider spatial factors when setting carbon intensity reduction targets. To reduce carbon intensity, policy intervention in prefecture-level cities should match the policies of neighboring prefecture-level cities. We can set up a low carbon pilot area, summarizing the experiences and lessons of low carbon development to provide references for the development of other regions. Compared to the national average of convergence speed of 0.229 (Hao et al., 2015a) , the convergence speed is lower, only 0.1753 in the YRD and the reason is the lower carbon intensity in the YRD.",

Using grid data analyses in ArcGIS 10.2 and spatial econometric methods offers a new method for analyzing the convergence of carbon intensity. In addition, we investigated the convergence of carbon intensity rather than carbon emissions used by previous scholars. Our investigation provides guidance for the allocation of carbon intensity reductions in the YRD. Furthermore, considering spatial factors, we employed SEM and SLM to analyze the convergence of carbon intensity, finding that a spatial spillover effect is significant in the annual growth rate of carbon intensity across prefecture-level cities in the YRD; the spatial spillover effect accelerates the convergence rate.",

The convergence rate of carbon intensity can only guide policymakers to roughly allocate carbon intensity, but it cannot allocate carbon intensity concretely. Because prefecture-level cities have different rates of convergence and steady state, it is unavailable for this study to estimate the steady state level in each prefecture-level city. In future study, steady state level of each prefecture-level city could be estimated under new theoretical framework. If data from 2011 to 2015 can be obtained in the future, new studies may provide suggestions for carbon intensity reduction allocations over the Thirteenth Five-Year (2016e2020) Plan.",

Carbon intensity shows an overall downward trend in three main stages: the first one is from 2000 to 2002, a decreasing trend; the second one is from 2002 to 2004, a rising trend; and the third stage, an again decreasing trend. Carbon intensity shows increasing trends in 2003, 2004 and 2008. The standard deviation of carbon intensity was calculated to investigate the s-convergence. Similar to carbon intensity, the maximum value of s is 1.7577 and the minimum value is 1.2893 in 2010. Overall, it descended by 26.65% from 2000 to 2010. During the period of 2002e2004, s increased, indicating the divergence of carbon intensity during 2002e2004, and the absolute disparities of carbon intensity increased. s has declined over other periods (2000e2002 and 2004e2010), indicating the s-convergence of carbon intensity and the absolute disparities of carbon intensity decreased.",
