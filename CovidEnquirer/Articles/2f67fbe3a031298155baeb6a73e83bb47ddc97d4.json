            "text": "Previous studies indicated that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) interacted with specific sequences in the 3% non-coding region of IBV RNA. In order to identify domains in the N protein that bind to RNA, the whole protein (409 amino acids) and six overlapping fragments were expressed as fusion polypeptides with six histidine-tags. Using gel shift assays, the intact N protein and amino polypeptides, from residues 1 to 171 and residues 1 to 274, and carboxyl polypeptides, extending from residues 203 to 409 and residues 268 to 407, were found to interact with positive-stranded IBV RNA representing the 3% end of the genome. The two 32 P-labeled probes that interacted with N and the amino and carboxyl fragments of N were RNA consisting of the IBV N gene and adjacent 3% non-coding terminus, and RNA consisting of the 155-nucleotide sequences at the 3% end of the 504-nt 3% untranslated region. In contrast, the polypeptide fragment from the middle region, residues 101 -283, did not interact with these 3% IBV RNAs. The binding site in the amino region of N was either not present or only partially present in the first 91 residues because no interaction with RNA was observed with the polypeptide incorporating these residues. Cache Valley virus N expressed with a histidine tag, bovine serum albumin, and the basic lysozyme protein did not shift the IBV RNA. The lower molarities of the carboxyl fragment compared with residue 1 -274 fragment needed for equivalent shifts suggested that the binding avidity for RNA at the carboxyl domain was greater than the amino domain.",

            "text": "The putative functions of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) N protein depend on its interaction with viral RNA . Encapsidation of MHV RNA requires that the N protein recognize the packaging signal, a 69-nt stem-loop structure positioned at the end of ORF 1b, whereas the packaging signal in the porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus apparently lies in the ORF 1a (Van der Most et al., 1991; Fosmire et al., 1992; Izeta et al., 1999) . Interactions between the MHV N protein and the packaging signal have been reported (Molenkamp and Spaan, 1997) . A 1.4-kb sequence, corresponding to IBV sequence at the 5% end of the 1b gene, may be involved in the packaging of IBV RNAs or form part of a cis-acting replication element (Penzes et al., 1996) . However, subgenomic RNAs, lacking the described packaging signals, have been detected in the packaged IBV particles (Zhao et al., 1993) . MHV N protein has also been shown to interact specifically with the 5% leader-containing sequences Stohlman et al., 1988) . Anti-N protein monoclonal antibodies were reported to precipitate both full-length and subgenomic RNAs, as well as replicative intermediate RNA (Stohlman et al., 1988) . Compton et al. (1987) found that RNA synthesis was greater than 90% inhibited by antibodies to MHV N protein in an in vitro synthesis system prepared from the infected cells. All these data suggest that the coronavirus N protein is likely to be involved in viral RNA replication, transcription and packaging.",

A BamHI site was included at the 5% end and a HindIII site at the 3% end. The PCR amplified cDNAs were cloned into TA cloning vectors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmids containing the inserts were digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the inserts were purified in 1% agarose gels and then ligated into pQE8 vectors, which were also fully digested with BamHI and HindIII (Sambrook et al., 1989) . The fusion protein and polypeptides expressed from pQE8 plasmid contained six histidine tags at the amino termini. M15/pREP cells were transformed with the ligated constructs and incubated on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin and ampicillin.

N protein, and A171, A274, C207 and C140 polypeptides shifted the G RNA probe (Fig. 4) while the 173 residue fragment in the middle of N protein did not (lane 5, Fig. 4 ). C140 and C207 shifted the RNA probes further than amino terminal polypeptides and the intact N protein did. The C140 and C207 polypeptides, which had a tendency to aggregate during column chromatography purification in the absence of RNA, also formed complexes with radioactive RNA probe complexes that did not migrated into the gel (data not shown). Therefore, the radioactivity in the bands of lower molecular weight were reduced in intensity. To rule out that G RNA interacts with N protein and polypeptides simply because they are basic, lysozyme, a basic protein, were added to individual wells on a 72-well Terasaki plate. The 500-ml probe mixture was prepared by mixing 200 ml 5\u00d7 gel shift assay buffer (125 mM Hepes, 125 mM EDTA, 750 mM NaCl, 25 mM DTT, 50% glycerol, pH 7.4), 250 ng labeled RNA probe, 50 mg yeast tRNA and 1000 U RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI).

The shift of IBV RNA always increases with increasing amount of protein. Multiple bands can even be observed with some inter- actions. Furthermore, the carboxyl polypeptides, C140 and C207, shifted the RNA probe further than amino region polypeptides. Protein-protein interactions may also contribute to the increased complexity of interactions with RNA. This phenomenon may be explained by the presence of multiple binding sites in the RNA and/or protein. The carboxyl region polypeptides, even the smaller C140 fragment, were found to form large complexes in the absence of RNA during filtration purification through Bio-Gel P60 (data not shown). Formation of N multimers was also observed by Robbins et al. (1986) where multiple bands were detected by labeled RNA with RNA protein blot analysis.",

Studies on MHV also indicated that both N protein and sequences in the 3% non-coding region are involved in regulating the viral RNA replication and transcription (Compton et al., 1987; Lin et al., 1996) . The putative roles that the IBV N protein plays in replication and transcription could be speculated. Critical amounts of N protein may act as an inhibitor competing with transcriptional factors for the binding sites. Alternatively, the N protein could promote transcriptional factors to the sites. The 3% non-coding region of MHV has been shown to interact with cellular proteins (Yu and Leibowitz, 1995) ; the actual involvement of those proteins in viral RNA transcription is not clear.",
