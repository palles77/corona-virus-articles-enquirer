Regardless of the nature of the emergency, the organizational response will be quite different when the emergency condition exists within the facility from when it occurs at some distant location. The actual emergency response programs of healthcare facilities indicate that much more effort has gone into a prepared response to external emergencies than to internal emergencies. Exceptions can be found in the areas of fire safety and bomb threat programs, in which various regulatory and accrediting agencies have considerable involvement. A general list of situations that require emergency planning is difficult to compile; however, the situations listed in Table 24 -1 should serve as a starting point, depending on the geographical location and type of patient care facility.

The security response will primarily be a support role in the care and treatment of patients.

Emergency plans should include community involvement-other HcFs, emergency responders, and government agencies. j. Emergency plans should include provision for the care and well-being of HcF staff and their families. People who have been assigned to observe specific aspects of the plan must meet after the drill to determine the plan's effectiveness. It is generally agreed that observers should be people from outside the organization when possible. They traditionally come from state agencies, offices of emergency preparedness, medical societies, or other medical care facilities. drills serve a very important purpose, and they must be conducted with all the realism possible. It is extremely difficult, however, to rehearse certain parts of an emergency disaster plan when the facility is open and conducting routine, everyday business. one of the most difficult elements to practice is that of people and vehicle traffic control. It is not practical to restrict visiting or to turn away patients who have an appointment. Physicians and the community will not accept the curtailment of normal activities for a drill. Real progress has been made in the last few years for healthcare providers to integrate their emergency management planning and operations with other community resources. This area-wide coordination has greatly improved the ability of a community, working together, to respond more effectively to the vast array of different types of emergencies both large and small. It is therefore natural to conduct emergency exercises and drills, both organization-specific and community-wide. There will continue to be more and more federal involvement in community emergency management through control of grants and legislation. An emerging federal program is the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP), which develops standards for hospital exercises. Many hospitals already use HSEEP methods to conduct their drills in conjunction with community public safety agencies.",

The HIcS model is specifically directed to hospitals for incorporating a command structure, defined responsibilities, and common terms. It should be noted that the original california model was named Hospital Emergency Incident command System (HEIcS) and in 2005 the word Emergency was dropped to become HIcS. The nIMS model is a somewhat broader model (nonspecific to type of industry or organization) of practices in emergency preparedness and response to a national framework of managing critical incidents.

Security officers on rounds should be particularly alert for people smoking in prohibited areas. officers should correct and report doors left open that should be closed, obstructions to egress paths, careless use of oxygen cylinders, and other fire safety violations.

The life Safety code-through its standards for exit capacities, types of exits, travel distance, door specifications, and similar details-ensures the necessary means of egress from a medical care facility during an emergency. It is the healthcare staff, however, who are responsible for moving any patients who are in imminent danger to a safe location. In hospitals, many occupants are incapable of self-preservation. This fact is recognized by the life Safety code, which places the main responsibility for patient safety on the HcF staff. Total building evacuation, as a measure of last resort, can and does occur. Patient relocation between smoke-protected compartments on the same floor is usually an adequate first step. Following the unit concept principle, the evacuation plan's first objective is to move patients to a safe compartment. At this point, it must be determined whether to continue horizontal evacuation or whether vertical movement (to another floor) is necessary. Wheelchairs and carts are useful and often necessary for relocating patients, but they may not always be available at the time and place of need. Blankets are always available, and security professionals generally agree that they can be the most important pieces of equipment on hand for evacuation. Elevators should receive special consideration in the fire evacuation plan. Generally, plans prohibit the use of elevators for egress or relocation purposes because of their recall features, which are normally activated in a fire condition. An elevator may stop at the wrong floor, exposing its occupants to the fire. on the other hand, high-rise hospitals present unique problems that may require the use of elevators for vertical relocation under controlled conditions. In addition, the fire department may need to utilize an elevator for their firefighting purposes. Generally a building of more than seven stories is considered a high-rise, and is the limit of most fire department ladders. A vertical evacuation plan is mandatory for high-rise buildings. one or more elevators in a wing removed from the fire area may be used to transport patients to another floor much more quickly and with fewer possible medical complications than when patients are carried down a stairwell. It is noted that not all evacuation of patients will be related to a fire situation. Evacuation for any number of emergency conditions such as weather disasters, loss of infrastructure support, bomb threats and such may require moving large numbers of patients. The unique operational issues of evacuation under different conditions should be covered in the organization's EoP. In terms of providing evacuation plans for different types of patients, the forensic patient must also be part of the planning effort.",

The sprinkler is activated by a thermally sensitive element that automatically releases water at a predetermined temperature. other piped extinguishing systems include water spray, foam, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, Halon, and newer, environmentally sensitive, clean agents. The standpipe and hose system, found in most uS medical care facilities, is used to provide quick and convenient water streams. This system is most generally used by fire department or trained fire brigade personnel. It is not uncommon to eliminate the hose at the valve locations. The rationale for this is that most fire departments supply their own hose. Further, there have been reports of vandalism by opening the valve a little, allowing the hose in the cabinet to fill slowly with water.

Many chemicals can be used to make a bomb, and most chemicals are easily obtainable. dynamite can be purchased or stolen from construction sites. Ammonium nitrate is sold in stores that handle fertilizers. Potassium nitrate and black powder can be bought at shops that supply chemists or hunters. Pipe bombs are commonly used by amateur bombers. These bombs are made from an ordinary pipe capped on both ends and filled generally with black powder.",

It is not practical or possible to conduct an all-out search in every case. An all-out search includes everything from checking every patient's belongings to removing all suspended ceiling tiles and all ventilation grille work. It could take at least a day or two to completely search a facility. It is presumed that people who carry bombs are well aware of the danger of premature detonation, and therefore in most cases they will want to get into the facility quickly and to get out even more quickly-which generally precludes an elaborate hiding process. If sufficient organizational personnel are available, the search should be conducted by staff rather than by the police or fire department. The proper role of the outside support agencies is to assume control if a bomb or suspected bomb is located. Employees should conduct the search for two basic reasons. First, staff are in the best position to know what belongs and what does not belong to a given area. Staff are more knowledgeable of the layout of the facility and either have the capability to enter locked or controlled areas or know how to obtain access.",

Thus, one objective of a bomb search is to carry out the search in a smooth, routine manner, while taking every threat seriously. In bomb threat situations, the administrative person handling the threat may decide to advise only selected staff and patients. In general, patients should not be told of the problem unless absolutely necessary. Experience has shown that patients often set off a chain reaction that is detrimental to the entire process.

In other plans, this information is communicated by telephone or through a public address system with a code term such as \"Mr. Search\" or \"code Green,\" or via electronic means. A problem that must be taken into consideration is the staffing pattern of the facility. When all departments are fully operational, the facility can be more easily and quickly searched than when departments are closed and locked. during the nonoperational period, security, maintenance, and environmental services personnel may be assigned an expanded role in the search effort. Floor plans that have been divided into specific search areas are used in some facilities. Personnel are given a map of the area for which they are responsible. In other organizations, these assignments are made from an administrative checklist that defines the areas. However the parameters of the search are defined, the person responsible for searching a given area must always report back to the control center when the search has been completed. The primary concern is for personal safety rather than property. Thus, a threat at 11:30 P.M., when a minimal staff is on duty, may preclude searching all areas. It may be that closed areas such as food service, business and accounting areas, administrative offices, maintenance shops, medical record areas, and the like receive only cursory examination. The occupied areas of the facility should be searched more thoroughly. Some controversy exists over the use of two-way radios during a bomb search. It has been suggested that radios should not be used because a bomb might be constructed to detonate in response to the transmission of radio signals. However, most experts believe that this possibility is extremely remote. In almost all situations, the radio system is active before the bomb threat was received and would have already detonated the device. The benefits of two-way radios during emergency operations support their use unless specific information is received to the contrary.",

Picketing refers to the placement of people around the exterior of the facility for the dual purposes of informing the public of alleged problems and curtailing deliveries of supplies and equipment. The primary purpose of a strike is to create hardships for the organizations, weaken their bargaining position, and resolve the dispute in favor of the protesters. The hardships may include disruption of patient care, intimidation of nonstriking staff, loss of revenue, damaged or stolen property, negative community reaction toward the facility, and injury to persons. An organization need not be unionized to become the focus of a picket line. Picketing may be set up as a result of a strike or for the purpose of attempting to force the organization to recognize a collective bargaining unit.

When the picketers see that employees are not being sufficiently discouraged and do cross the line to work, confrontations sometimes begin to take place. It is at this point that threats and acts of violence often occur. Administrators and supervisory personnel should be on the grounds during shift changes to support arriving personnel and to observe any incidents that might occur. Employees arriving to work are encouraged when they see the upper echelon there to support them rather than sitting safely behind their desks. Most healthcare facilities have a built-in security vulnerability that can become an asset during picket activities: a multitude of entrances and exits. For the duration of the strike or picketing, as many of these access points as possible should be open for employee use. The more entrances that are available, the more difficult it becomes for the picketers to cover them all. The law states that picket lines shall not restrict the right of people to enter and leave the facility. despite this provision, thousands of incidents on record involve injury to people and destruction of property during picketing. In coping with this situation, it is a common mistake to assume that law enforcement agencies will maintain law and order. unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, police protection is not always at its best at such times. The healthcare organization has a responsibility to provide for personal safety and to protect its assets. The security department will necessarily play a strong role in achieving this objective. Several days before the strike, there should be a thorough inspection of the exterior of the facility to remove signs and other items that could be easily vandalized. one item often overlooked is sprinkler heads-a favorite target for picketers. Security personnel are generally deployed at the site of the picket line to show nonstriking employees and others who cross the line a high degree of protective support. Security's additional responsibility is to ensure that picketers stay off facility property, to prevent accidents, and to document evidence of wrongdoing. It is recommended that security personnel assigned to the strike detail be unarmed. A security objective is to be present but to project a fairly low profile, indicating that no trouble is expected. The type of trouble that might occur will not be deterred or corrected with the threat or use of a firearm. Security officers should be briefed by the administration and legal counsel just before they are deployed to the picket line. The basic message this briefing should convey is that officers must be professional. They must keep their eyes and ears open and their mouths closed. The officers should be reminded that they are representatives of the organization, regardless of their personal feelings about the situation.",

A major administrative mistake is to assume that the confrontation will not last long. This assumption makes it easy to ignore the central reporting and its record-keeping role until the organization is well into a prolonged strike. All information concerning activities and incidents related to the labor action should be reported immediately to the designated recording location. All supervisory employees should be given the responsibility of reporting all incidents brought to their attention. A chronological record of incidents, including complete details, serves a variety of purposes, not the least of which is collecting the data necessary for legal actions. A consolidated central reporting concept will also serve as a clearinghouse to verify or reject rumors and to readily assess the situation. An important tool in dealing with and documenting strikes and picketing-and one that relates very closely to the incident recording function-is the use of photography. The task of photographing the labor action should be an assigned responsibility. Because camera equipment is often antagonizing to picketers, it should be used in such a manner that a minimum of confrontation occurs. The organization's response to the labor action may require the unexpected expenditure of funds. Special arrangements may have to be made to procure supplies, obtain drivers and vehicles, authorize meals, use taxi services, authorize overtime, and the like. during times of strike, the customary management controls tend to be loosened. Specific guidelines must be drawn up for these unexpected expenditures, and the individuals who authorize the use of funds must keep adequate records.",

In most instances, a supply line requires the procurement of additional labor and vehicles. If vehicles are obtained from rental or leasing companies, it is usually only a matter of time before the rental agency demands the return of their vehicles. This tactic can be countered to some extent by having individuals rent vehicles from various agencies for onetime use. This procedure also proves valuable in avoiding harassment because the newly rented vehicle can be used to pick up supplies without being followed and subjected to threats, damage, or driver injury. Before picketing begins, the organization should contact all suppliers who make deliveries to the facility. The facility needs to know if nonunion or supervisory personnel will be available to make deliveries. It is better to pick up the supplies directly from the vendor or to have the order shipped to a temporary receiving site than to have confrontations between picketers and truck drivers. When truck drivers refuse to cross the line, their action supports and encourages the picketers. Because it is impossible for the facility to pick up the thousands of items it requires, particularly during a prolonged strike, offsite receiving areas can become necessary. offsite receiving points should be well-secured and generally require security officer coverage. depending on the severity of the strike, the location of the offsite receiving point should be changed periodically. organizations should consider using a truck parked in a vacant lot or other outof-the-way place and simply off-loading from one truck to the other. If the loaded trucks are not brought to the facility the same day, security precautions are important. one HcF involved in a severe labor action had parked three trucks overnight in an abandoned section of a railroad yard, and all three trucks were fire-bombed. The picket line not only inhibits the free flow of deliveries but also affects the removal of items, particularly trash. An institution of any size will find that a tremendous volume of refuse can build up in a very short time. It is essential that facilities move quickly to dispose of this material or they may find themselves in violation of health and fire standards.

Even in limited amounts, the theft of radioactive materials from these sources is a potential threat deserving of proper security safeguards.

Specifically, will arrests be made, and who will make this decision? once the police have been called, the facility must be prepared to sign complaints and to follow through in prosecuting demonstrators if the police are unable to persuade them to leave. of the many mob activities directed against healthcare facilities, a demonstration against the Beth Israel Medical center in new york many years ago is of particular interest to security practitioners. A group of people demonstrating under the banner of the Health Revolutionary unity Movement disrupted services, and the hospital sought and obtained a court injunction prohibiting demonstrations within the hospital. The decision handed down by Justice Mitchell of the new york Supreme court clearly stated that a medical facility is not a public place, and its sole purpose is to render medical care and treatment, for which a tranquil atmosphere is required. The opinion also stated that the demonstrators were in error when they justified their conduct on the basis of their constitutional right to freedom of speech and assembly. Although the case is more than 30 years old, other case law has supported these principles. Although the law supports medical care facilities in their defense against intrusion, injunctions take time, and facility protection still requires careful and detailed planning.",

Hospitals had previously handled mass casualties, but the influx of casualties from rioting created new complications for protection services, including: l confrontations between police and rioters that often continued into treatment rooms; l Hostile visitors who demanded attention, disrupted activity, and destroyed property to obtain their objective; l direct attacks on the facility, including firebombs and in one case a siege of gunfire.",

In mid-1980, heavy rioting hit Miami, Florida. one hospital, Jackson Memorial Medical center, was under siege for a few days as rioters burned and looted just outside the hospital's perimeter. Security professionals learned three things from these riots. First, police and fire protection services may not be available as assumed or even as promised. Many facilities suffered extensive damage and disruption because the municipal protection services were stretched so thin that adequate protection could not be furnished. Every protection plan should therefore be predicated on the assumption that no external help will be available. Second, employees may be sympathetic to the rioters and their cause. Employee sympathy may be manifested in the theft of drugs and supplies for use at first-aid stations set up by the rioters, or employees on duty may create disturbances within the facility in support of the rioters' cause. For example, a wastebasket fire was set in a stairwell in one reported case. Although no real damage resulted, the smoke created confusion and panic among patients and staff. Third, separate treatment areas for rioters and the public may be needed to minimize continuing confrontation.",

            "text": "Preparations for minimizing damage to the facility and safely moving employees cannot be made at the last minute. Thus, the first step in riot protection planning is to survey the perimeter of the property. For example, this might be the time to recommend fencing the north property line to divert foot traffic from crossing through parking areas. Security administrators should also consider whether exterior lighting is adequately protected to minimize destruction, whether landscaping decorations or other external items should be removed, and how employee vehicles should be protected. The next step is to carefully survey the exterior of the buildings that will require protection. Access doors and windows are of primary concern. Even though normal access points cannot be eliminated during normal operations, administrators must be prepared to quickly authorize restricted access when a riot hits. The time to make certain that doors are equipped with the proper hardware is before a riot occurs. Security administrators should select the access point that could be controlled best if only one entrance were to be operative. The best entrance is not necessarily the most accessible one. If the facility has an emergency department, two access points are generally required: one for persons seeking medical care and another for everyone else. Windows and other glass areas are primary targets for destruction. Breakresistant glazing material is commonly used for protection. Another method is to precut plywood and install brackets on the window frames to permit easy and quick installation. If no glass protection has been installed or if the protection is minimal, interior blinds or curtains should be closed. If beds are near a window, they should be moved as far from the window as possible. Exterior lighting must be reviewed to determine whether the illumination is adequate. More light is needed during rioting than is needed under normal conditions. Security administrators should also check to determine whether light fixtures can be modified to prevent damage. Generally, little can be done in this regard, but making certain that lights are not within easy reach is at least one step that can be taken.",

By manually controlling elevators, traffic can be controlled more readily, and in a sense the elevator operators provide an element of security. If emergency security posts are necessary, every possible post location should be given an activation priority so that as emergency conditions develop, the posts can be activated in a logical priority. The protection level will expand and contract during a civil disturbance crisis according to the threat at hand. Fire extinguishers and communications equipments are essential for every post; access lists and special equipment may be needed at particular posts. Planning may indicate that a reasonable approach to providing communications at every post is to install telephone jacks at each location or the use of cellular telephones.

The aforementioned california code study recommended 11 different codes, which many healthcare professionals feel is an excessive number of codes. consensus seems to be that the most practical approach would be to limit the number of standard codes to no more than five codes using color designators. As the debate continues, it is suggested that the three basic codes of blue, red, and pink be used as the basic system of emergency codes with individual facilities adding more codes if they are in fact needed.

If the emergency is an external transportation accident, staffing will be somewhat easy, as organization staffing will at least be par and as organization staffing will at least be par and hospital staff willing to stay past their shift or come from home. If it is a pandemic situation, the number of staff on duty may be fewer than normal, due to employee absences, and it is much more difficult to convince off-duty employees that you need them to come into work.

They include preplanned volunteers from other departments and an arrangement with a contract security service if the security department is an in-house program-neither of which works very well.

In addition to their name badge, employees carried a letter addressed to law enforcement that was signed by the hospital administrator, and contained the employee's name and address, the time dismissed from work, and a statement that the letter was intended for use only for the date indicated. This approach worked well and was reported to be widely accepted by law enforcement personnel. When police lines are established, altered travel routes are an obvious course of action. When police lines surround the facility, some procedure must be devised for staff access. Staff identification cards or badges are one solution. Another approach may be for a facility representative to be stationed at a central point along the police line to verify employee status. Individuals who attempt to cross the police line can be identified with simple questions about their department, employee number, birth date, or other data. The facility representative will be able to verify many employees by sight. during a civil disturbance, organizations may encourage employees to stay on the premises for their own safety and for the purpose of maintaining an adequate staff. Employees sometimes insist on staying regardless of the official stance, and thus some planning for employee housing is mandated. An inventory of beds that can be used in an emergency should be maintained. A thorough review of a facility often uncovers more beds than expected. Beds can sometimes be found in classrooms, blood banks, on-call rooms, and electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram areas. In addition, cots can be set up in many areas for temporary accommodations. To ensure the utilization of all beds and to keep a record of where employees are housed, assignments must be made by a designated facility representative. Employees should not be allowed to assume their own accommodations even in their own departments. When more employees request accommodations than are needed to work, a system of housing authorization by department heads may be necessary to maintain adequate control. There will of course be additional administrative and operational issues to be defined and addressed by individual healthcare provider organizations.",
