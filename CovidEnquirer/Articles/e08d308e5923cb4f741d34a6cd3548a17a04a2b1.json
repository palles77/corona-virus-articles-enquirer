Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group.

The causative pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . As of 06 March 2020, COVID-19 has caused 80,735 confirmed cases in China, of whom 3,045 died and 5,737 were admitted into ICU [2] . In response to this fast-spreading epidemic, the Chinese government has locked down the epicenter Wuhan city since 23 January 2020, and implemented a series of social distancing measures such as strict traffic restrictions, forbidden social gatherings, closure of residential communities [3] . The epidemiological data showed that most cases had mild symptoms, and overall case fatality rate was 2.3%. Although the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 seems considerably lower than two previous zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it was far more efficient to transmit between close contacts. [4] Particularly, this novel coronavirus has caused special concerns in pregnant women, because both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been found to cause severe complications in pregnant women [5] . Several reports on suspicious vertical transmission of this virus have further increased such concerns [6] . Although the recent laboratory studies and clinical reports did not find strong evidence to support a vertical transmission route, the possibility still cannot be completely ruled out [7] [8] [9] .",

We followed the clinical diagnosis criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia in the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) by the National Health Commission of China [15] . Throat swabs were collected from all these patients and sent to the laboratory of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention for tests of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis criteria of COVID-19 infection include 1) typical chest CT imaging of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity, and 2) positive in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies argued that false negative cases might be common for COVID-19 infection cases due to low virus titers, sampling at late stage of illness, and inappropriate swabbing sites [7] . Given overloaded healthcare systems and limited test capacities during our study period, we were concerned about underreporting of COVID-19 cases if solely relying on laboratory tests. Therefore, in this study we also included the suspected patients with typical chest CT imaging but negative in RT-PCR tests. Eleven pregnant women who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were classified as laboratory confirmed case group, and eighteen with typical chest CT imaging but tested negative in RT-PCR tests as suspected case group.",

All healthcare workers in close contacts should strictly adhere to contact and airborne precautions in addition to standard precautions. Similar to two previous reports of nine and one pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection [7, 20] , we did not find any evidence to support the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus via placenta or during cesarean section. Our study also added some evidence to suggest that the risk of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery might also be trivial. There were two patients with vaginal delivery, one was two days before the onset of symptoms and another was during the course of illness. Neither of their newborns had respiratory systems after birth. Unfortunately, none of them gave us the consent to collect the respiratory specimens of their neonates.

Second, we collected the data of sixteen pregnant women with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases with typical CT imaging. Although this is the largest number of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in literature so far, the sample size is still relatively small. Nevertheless, given the potential of this virus to cause a global pandemic, we believe our study could be one of important clinical studies to guide the clinical diagnosis and treatment to this vulnerable group.",
