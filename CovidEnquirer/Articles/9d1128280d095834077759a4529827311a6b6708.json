Herein we report the design, synthesis and antiviral evaluation of a new family of non-nucleoside antivirals, derived from 1-[x-(4-bromophenoxy)alkyl]uracil derivatives -previously reported inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Introduction of the N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide side chain at N 3 increased their potency and widened activity spectrum. The most active compounds in the series exhibit submicromolar activity against different viral strains of HCMV and varicella zoster virus (VZV) replication in HEL cell cultures. Inactivity against other DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1/2, points to a novel mechanism of antiviral action.",

Despite modern prevention and treatment strategies, they remain a common opportunistic pathogen associated with serious morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients 1 and AIDS patients. 2, 3 All drugs currently licensed for the treatment of HCMV and VZV infections ( Fig. 1) target the viral DNA polymerase. Unfortunately they are associated with severe toxicity issues, including marrow toxicity for ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and cidofovir, and renal toxicity for foscarnet and cidofovir. 4, 5 The emergence of drug resistance is also a significant problem. 6 Moreover, our understanding of the full spectrum of risks of HCMV infection and its interactions with the host immune system remains far from complete. 7 While the past two decades have seen progress toward novel treatments for herpesviruses, the need for better drugs that exhibit an improved toxicity profile persists. 8 Previously, we have described a series of 1-[x-(phenoxy)alkyl] uracil derivatives that were found to exhibit high specificity and promising inhibitory activity against HCMV replication in HEL cell cultures with EC 50 values within 5.5-12 lM range. 9 These results provided strong impetus to further explore structure-activity relationships and the antiviral activity spectrum of similar scaffolds.

Based on the successful synthesis of several previously reported compounds, 9 a series of analogs were synthesized following the classical synthetic approach reported in Scheme 1. This first set of derivatives is characterized by focused modifications on the aromatic ring. The synthesis of compounds 4a-j started from commercially available phenols 1 (R 1 4-Ph or 4-CN), which were treated with 4-fold excess of a,x-dibromoalkanes 2 (n = 1-4, 6 or 8) to produce bromides 3a-i according to known procedures. [10] [11] [12] A modified silyl Hilbert-Johnson reaction, that is, condensation of equimolar amounts of 2,4-bis (trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidines 13 with bromides 3a-e, was performed at 160-170\u00b0C in the absence of solvent 9 to afford target compounds 4a-e in 76-88% yield. Compounds 4f-j comprising 3, 4, 6, and 8 methylene units, respectively, were obtained in an analogous manner as was used for compounds 4a-e (Scheme 1).",

To avoid possible complications due to iodine elimination, compound 7j was obtained from 4j and 2-chloroacetamide 6a employing NaH as the base. 16 Target compound 7j was subsequently isolated in 86% yield. 15 In order to obtain benzophenone derivative 9, the appropriate building blocks were obtained in a somewhat different order. First, acid 8 was synthesized quantitatively via treatment of 4b with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of K 2 CO 3 , followed by hydrolysis using LiOH according to published procedures. 17 Subsequent conversion of acid 8 into the corresponding acyl chloride, followed by condensation with the N-trimethylsilyl derivative of 4-(benzoyl)aniline led to 9 in 57% yield (Scheme 3). 15 It should be noted that utilization of base-free conditions for the synthesis of 9 avoids the by-products that typically arise from Knoevenagel condensation between the benzophenone carbonyl and the active methylene of the acetic acid residue. 18 To further explore the SAR of these compounds, we then designed a second set of analogs featuring a modified spacer linking the N 1 of the uracil with the aromatic moiety. Synthesis of the various target structures demanded different, but related approaches. Copper-catalyzed coupling of phenylmagnesium bromide (10) with excess of 1,6-dibromohexane 19 in THF media produced bromide 11, which was condensated with 2,4-bis (trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine to afford 1-(6-phenylhexyl)uracil (12) , however in an unexpectedly mediocre 30% yield (Scheme 4). This was somewhat surprising since our previous observations for this reaction involving similar x-(phenoxy)alkyl bromides 3a-i as alkylating agents were, in contrast, quite efficient. 9 Silyl Hilbert-Johnson reactions between 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine and alkyl bromides are known to be associated with the release of trimethylsilyl bromide.

Since thymidine kinase is required for the activation of nucleoside analogs (e.g., acyclovir and brivudin), it is likely these compounds are acting as nonnucleoside inhibitors. 24 Other substituents at R 1 were found inactive (7a, 7c-e). As was noted for the HCMV inhibition, elongation of the spacer has a pronounced positive impact on the anti-VZV properties.
