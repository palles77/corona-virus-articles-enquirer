Faecal coliforms almost always exceeded 1,600 per 100 ml of water with a range from 60 to 18,000 per 100 ml. Total coliform counts were even higher. In England it is recommended that supplies should be condemned where this figure exceeds 10 coliforms per 100 ml. Examination of unconcentrated 50 ml aliquots of water for specific pathogens yielded salmonellae from one well and from two water pots not filled from the affected well. In a different situation, concentration techniques would be used and it is likely that contamination with salmonella is more widespread than we have shown.",

Bile salts are synthesized in the liver, stored in the gall bladder and discharged into the small intestine during a meal. There they play a key role in many of the digestive processes, coming together above a certain concentration to form micelles which solubilize dietary lipid ready for absorption.",

The results are summarized in Figs. 3-5. One half of the Keneba survey population specimens fall below the critical micellar concentration of 2 mM per 1 (Fig. 3) . The mean total bile salt concentration in a group of U.K. controls was 7 mM per 1. The ratio of glycine: taurine conjugates is usually three; half of the Keneba survey children were clearly abnormal, with values in excess of six (Fig. 4) . This is identical to the pattern seen in ileal resections and in this situation is likely to be due to malabsorption of the taurine conjugates. Normally dihydroxy bile salts account for 60% of the total bile salts present. Four-fifths of the Keneba series had a dihydroxy bile salt concentration of less than 50 % of the total (Fig. 5) .",
