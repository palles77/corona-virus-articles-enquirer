In mice homozygous for the paucity of lymph node T cell ( plt ) mutation, naive T cells fail to home to LNs or the lymphoid regions of spleen. Here we demonstrate that expression of SLC is undetectable in plt mice. In addition to the defect in T cell homing, we demonstrate that dendritic cells (DCs) fail to accumulate in spleen and LN T cell zones of plt mice. DC migration to LNs after contact sensitization is also substantially reduced. The physiologic significance of these abnormalities in plt mice is indicated by a markedly increased sensitivity to infection with murine hepatitis virus. The plt mutation maps to the SLC locus; however, the sequence of SLC introns and exons in plt mice is normal. These findings suggest that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC and that SLC mediates the entry of naive T cells and antigen-stimulated DCs into the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs.",

Their function requires the colocalization of two distinct populations of leukocytes: antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) 1 and antigen-responsive naive lymphocytes (1) . Chemokines, a rapidly growing family of small chemotactic cytokines, are believed to provide the signals that guide leukocytes to their proper location within lymphoid organs (2, 3) . Several recently identified chemokines have been suggested to mediate the constitutive trafficking of leukocytes based on their in vitro characteristics and their expression in lymphoid tissues (4) . A role for chemokines in B cell localization was shown by a targeted disruption of the chemokine receptor Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, the involvement of chemokines in the localization of either T cells or DCs within lymphoid organs has not been directly demonstrated.",

To sample this antigen repertoire, T lymphocytes that have never been stimulated by antigen (naive T cells) migrate or \"home\" specifically to the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs. In LNs and Peyer's patches (PPs), lymphocytes leave the blood through specialized high endothelial venules (HEVs) by a series of discrete steps which include selectin-mediated rolling, integrin activation, integrinmediated firm adhesion, and endothelial extravasation (16, 17) . In spleen, which lacks HEVs, lymphocytes exit the blood in the marginal zone and migrate to the T cell zone within the splenic white pulp by a poorly understood route (18) . Within the T cell zones of these lymphoid organs, a 452 Leukocyte Trafficking in Mice Lacking SLC continuous flow of naive T cells sample the antigens presented by DCs.

SLC has been hypothesized to mediate the homing of naive lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid tissues based on several findings (23) . SLC is the only chemokine known to be constitutively expressed in the endothelial cells of HEVs (23) . SLC stimulates the chemotaxis of naive T cells and, to a lesser extent, memory T cells and B cells (23, 24) . SLC stimulates both the \u2423 L \u2424 2 integrinmediated adhesion of T cells to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and the \u2423 4 \u2424 7 integrin-mediated adhesion of these cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MadCAM)-1 (23, 25, 26) . Activated \u2423 L \u2424 2 function is essential for lymphocyte homing to LNs and PPs, and activated \u2423 4 \u2424 7 is required for homing to PPs. Under physiologic flow conditions, SLC stimulates the arrest of rolling T cells with an efficiency and subset specificity (naive versus memory) similar to that seen in vivo (27) . These properties strongly suggest that SLC mediates the homing of naive T cells and perhaps other lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs; however, this has not been demonstrated directly.",

When injected into plt mice, T lymphocytes from wild-type ( \u03e9 / \u03e9 ) mice fail to enter LNs and PPs and accumulate only in the red pulp of spleen, whereas lymphocytes from plt mice home normally in \u03e9 / \u03e9 mice. These findings demonstrate that the plt defect affects a gene expressed in the lymphoid organ stroma. Although the exact mutation has not been identified, the plt locus maps to mouse chromosome 4 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 9p13. Two known human chemokine genes map to 9p13: SLC and EBV-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine (ELC) (19) .",

Our findings suggest that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC and that SLC is required for the entry of both naive T lymphocytes and antigen-bearing DCs into the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs.",

The finding that SLC is not expressed in plt mice strongly supports the hypothesis that SLC is required for naive T cell homing. Like naive T cells, activated DCs migrate to the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs. Therefore, we examined the distribution of DCs in plt mice. By FACS \u00ae analysis, DC numbers were decreased 60% in the LNs of plt mice (Fig. 2 A) . The average number of total I-A \u03e9 DCs in the pooled LNs of \u03e9/\u03e9 mice was 24.5 \u03ee 4.7 \u03eb 10 3 per mouse compared with 9.1 \u03ee 2.4 \u03eb 10 3 in plt mice (P \u03fd 0.01, n \u03ed 3). Immunohistochemistry established that this decrease was most pronounced in the deep cortex. Those DCs that were present in plt mice typically clustered in the internodular cortex (Fig. 3, A and B ). In the spleens of plt mice, the total number of DCs was normal (Fig. 2 B) , but there was a striking abnormality in cell distribution (Fig. 3) . Staining with anti-CD11c revealed a marked decrease in the number of DCs within the white pulp (Fig. 3 , C and D). There was a concomitant increase in the number of DCs located outside the white pulp, either in bridging channels or in isolated clusters within the red pulp, such that the total number of splenic DCs remained normal. Staining with NLDC-145, which in the spleen is specific for interdigitating DCs (34) , also revealed a decrease in the number of these cells within the white pulp and demonstrated that those DCs outside the white pulp were NLDC-145 negative (Fig. 3, E and F) .",

Interdigitating DCs in the T cell zones of LNs arise from DCs in the periphery which migrate to this area via the lymph after activation. To determine if the paucity of interdigitating cells observed in plt mice was due to a defect in the migration of DCs to LNs, we examined this migration after contact sensitization. 24 h after skin painting with 2 mg FITC, the frequency of FITC \u03e9 cells in the draining LNs of plt mice was markedly reduced compared with \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (Fig. 4 A) . The identity of these cells as DCs was confirmed by their characteristic forward and side scatter profiles, their staining with anti-CD11c (Fig. 4 B) and anti-I-A (Fig. 4 C) , and their low buoyant density. A comparison of eight FITC-painted plt mice with controls at 24 h revealed a 75% decrease in the number of FITC \u03e9 DCs in draining LNs (Fig. 4 D) . To ensure that the FITC signal in draining LNs was due to the migration of DCs rather than FITC accumulation within the LNs, we performed unilateral contact sensitization with low dose (0.2 mg) FITC and compared contralat-eral and draining LNs. In this procedure, resident (FITC \u03ea ) DCs can be distinguished from newly migrated (FITC \u03e9 ) DCs (35) . 24 h after skin painting, contralateral and draining LNs contained similar numbers of FITC \u03ea DCs in both \u03e9/\u03e9 and plt mice (Fig. 4 E) . Similar to results shown above, the number of resident DCs was decreased 60% in plt mice. The draining LNs of painted mice demonstrated accumulation of FITC \u03e9 I-A \u03e9 cells. In plt mice, the number of these newly migrated FITC \u03e9 DCs was decreased 73% compared with \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (29.5 \u03ee 11 \u03eb 10 3 vs. 8.1 \u03ee 5.7 \u03eb 10 3 , P \u03ed 0.011, n \u03ed 5).",

To determine if plt mice have a defect in the peripheral mobilization of DCs, we examined the migration of DCs out of cultured skin. Similar to our findings in abdominal epidermis, dorsal ear epidermis from plt mice contains a normal number of DCs (Fig. 6 E) . When segments of dorsal ear skin were placed in culture, the number of DCs within the epidermis of \u03e9/\u03e9 and plt mice decreased to a similar extent over 72 h (Fig. 6, A, B , and E). Over the same time period, the number of DCs within the dermis increased similarly in plt and \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (not shown). As described previously (31) , migrating DCs formed cords within the dermal lymphatics of \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (Fig. 6 C) . A similar formation of cords was seen in plt mice (Fig. 6 D) , demonstrating that the plt mutation does not inhibit the entry of DCs into lymphatics. When the cells migrating out of dorsal ear skin were collected over 72 h and counted, the number of DCs released from the skin of plt and \u03e9/\u03e9 mice was similar (Fig. 6 F) .",

To identify the genetic abnormality that leads to a loss of SLC expression in plt mice, we have initiated a search for the plt mutation at the DNA level. The murine SLC gene contains four exons spanning a total of 1 kb (Gunn, M.D., unpublished data).

Comparison of plt and \u03e9/\u03e9 sequence over a 3-kb region extending from 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site to 1 kb downstream of the polyadenylation signal revealed several single base changes but no mutation that would account for a loss of SLC expression (data not shown). Thus, while the plt mutation is located in the proximity of the SLC gene, it is not within SLC introns or exons.",

Second, they can provide a chemotactic signal for lymphocyte migration through the endothelium and into the underlying tissue. We believe that SLC is the chemokine that mediates the first of these steps during the homing of naive T cells to LNs and PPs. Evidence in support of this conclusion includes the expression of SLC on HEVs, the ability of SLC to activate both \u2423 L \u2424 2 and \u2423 4 \u2424 7 integrins on T cells, the ability of SLC to stimulate the rapid arrest of rolling T cells with an efficiency similar to that seen in vivo, and the absence of any other known chemokine with similar characteristics. We now add to this body of evidence by demonstrating that mice homozygous for the plt mutation do not express SLC (Fig. 1) . The lymphocyte homing defect in plt mice is similar to that seen when naive T cells are treated with pertussis toxin-failure of naive T cells to enter LNs, PPs, or the white pulp of spleen, suggesting that the defect in plt mice occurs in the initial steps of lympho-cyte extravasation (29, 42, 43) . Like pertussis toxin treatment, the lymphocyte homing defect in plt mice probably represents a loss of the signal for the integrin-mediated firm adhesion of naive T cells.",

The lack of T cells in the white pulp of spleen in plt mice suggests that SLC is also required for the entry of naive T cells into the T cell zones of spleen. By analogy with the defect seen in LNs, it is plausible that SLC provides the stimulus for an integrin activation step that is required for movement of naive T cells into the white pulp of spleen. SLC may also provide a chemotactic stimulus that guides naive T cells into the T cell zones of LNs and spleen. However, this function is unlikely to be unique, as other lymphocyte-specific chemokines such as ELC and DCCK1 are expressed in T cell zones (41, 44) . ELC has been shown to be more potent than SLC against naive T cells, and therefore may predominate in providing a chemotactic stimulus within the T cell zone (39) .",

Similarly, the expression of SLC at sites such as lymphatic endothelium suggested to us that SLC may be involved in other leukocyte trafficking events and that plt mice may have other leukocyte trafficking defects. We now find that plt mice have a defect in the migration of DCs into the T cell zones of lymphoid organs. Four lines of evidence support this finding. First, the number of DCs in the T cell zones of LNs and spleen in plt mice is decreased (Fig. 3) . In the spleen, this decrease occurs despite a normal total number of splenic DCs (Fig. 2) . Second, DCs appear to accumulate at the periphery of T cell zones in both LNs and spleen of plt mice (Fig. 3) . The pattern of this accumulation is consistent with a block in the entry of DCs into T cell zones. Third, we directly demonstrate a decrease in the migration of FITC-activated DCs to draining LNs of plt mice (Fig. 4) . It is possible that this defect in DC migration is secondary to the paucity of T cells in the LNs of plt mice. However, in both L-selectin knockout mice, which have a defect in the homing of naive lymphocytes to LNs similar to that of plt mice, and nude mice, which lack mature T cells, FITC-stimulated migration of DCs to LNs is normal (12, 35, 45, 46) . This suggests that DC migration to LNs is not lymphocyte dependent. Fourth, splenic DCs in the bridging channels and red pulp of plt mice fail to redistribute to the T cell zone upon activation with LPS (Fig. 5, C and D) . Taken together, these results suggest that plt mice lack a factor that acts directly on DCs to stimulate their migration. Due to its lack of expression, the probable identity of this factor is SLC.",

DCs derived in culture from monocytes or CD34 \u03e9 precursors do not express CCR7, the receptor for SLC and ELC. CCR7 expression is induced in these cells by activation with LPS, CD40 ligand, or TNF. Similarly, activated DCs increase intracellular calcium and undergo chemotaxis in response to ELC. These results suggest that immature DCs become responsive to SLC and ELC upon activation in vivo and that one or both of these chemokines is involved in the migration of activated DCs. It has been suggested that it is the activation-induced downregulation of chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR5, and CCR6 that allows DCs to leave sites of inflammation, whereas the more gradual induction of CCR7 on these cells allows them to enter T cell zones in response to ELC (47, 48) .

Still, some conclusions can be drawn from our results. The near-total loss of naive T cell homing in plt mice suggests an absolute requirement for SLC and the existence of at least one function that cannot be performed by ELC.

Although the plt mutation maps to the same genetic locus as SLC and plt mice express no detectable SLC, no DNA abnormality has been identified in these mice. Based on mapping data, the distance between the plt mutation and the SLC gene is between 1 and 1,000 kb. Given their normal SLC intron and exon sequences, we believe that the most likely cause of the lack of SLC expression in plt mice is a mutation involving a cis-acting regulatory region of the SLC gene. Such regions do not have to be in the immediate vicinity of the genes they regulate. For example, the deletion of a region 50 kb upstream of the human \u2424-globin gene leads to a loss of its expression (53) .

Numbers represent mean \u03ee SD (n \u03ed 8). (E) Comparison of DC content in contralateral (CLN) and draining (DLN) inguinal LNs in mice painted on one flank with 0.2 mg FITC. Single cell suspensions were prepared from individual LNs, stained with anti-I-Ad and anti-B220, and analyzed by flow cytometry gated on I-A \u03e9 B220 \u03ea cells.",

Nonadherent cells were collected from the bottom of wells in which ear skin had been cultured for 72 h. Total cell number was determined by counting on a hemocytometer. The proportion of DCs was calculated by examining anti-I-Ad-stained cytospins of nonadherent cells. Results represent the mean \u03ee SD of DCs/well over four wells.",
