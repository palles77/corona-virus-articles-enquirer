The results show: 1) that high yield markets have, on average, consistently underperformed the industry in both passenger and revenue growth, whereas low yield markets have led the industry in both areas; and 2) mid-sized ODs have experienced higher average growth and lower volatility than the largest U.S. domestic ODs, which have accounted for the least revenue per passenger as compared to all other market types. Financial portfolio analysis indicates the prospect of long-term decision making based on OD market risk and return rather than the aggregated market share analysis used by airlines today.",

            "text": "Air transportation represents the most highly networked travel system in the world. This network is comprised of markets with varying levels of growth, performance, and volatility. Over the last decade, international air travel markets have experienced overall volatility resulting from increased competition and external shocks like the September 11th, 2001 terroristic attacks, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 and the financial market crisis in 2008 and 2009 (Franke and John, 2011) . Volatility is expected to increase tremendously beyond 2025 (Linz and Rothkopf, 2010) , necessitating the ability to delineate between \"winners\" and \"losers\" in airline planning. A considerable amount has been written on the U.S. industry's reaction to volatility resulting from competitive entry, singular shocks (Franke and John, 2011; Bhadra and Kee, 2008; Lai and Lu, 2005; Ito and Lee, 2004; Belobaba and Van Acker, 1994) and the transmission of these shocks throughout the airline industry (Gillen and Lall, 2003) . Nevertheless, our understanding of the nature and dynamics of U.S. domestic air travel demand and the functioning of individual passenger markets remains limited, as suggested by Bhadra and Kee (2008) . Furthermore, our ability to make long-term network planning decisions is similarly restricted by this lack of understanding.",

Improved understanding of U.S. OD markets can bridge the gap between macro-level strategic planning and micro-level network planning to support long-term optimization and stability. Aggregation at the macro-level leads to decision making that is calibrated by all of the U.S. OD markets. Our strategy is to analyze OD market peer groups, clustered by three intrinsic characteristics, to compare a market's risk and return relative to its peers. Today, airline planning is akin to a financial investor choosing to obligate additional assets to a given investment on the basis of that investment's prior performance (e.g., invest $100 in GOOG because it grew at 5% over the previous period) without consideration of the opportunity cost of investing that $100 (e.g., how is GOOG performing relative to other technology stocks, or the NASDAQ index).",

Similarly, airline network planners can apply portfolio thinking to analyze the risk and return of it investments (resource allocation) in its various OD markets (e.g., short-haul, high volume, business markets or long-haul vacation/ leisure markets) to determine an acceptable level of risk and expected return over the long-term. Our research leverages financial portfolio thinking and statistical cluster analysis to enable comparisons across and within network clusters, allowing for a richer context in assessments of market performance.",

Passenger volume and yield describe the demographics of the OD market. A change in these characteristics occurs over a long timeframe and is not highly variable given an airline's decision to enter or exit the market. To perform this segmentation, we used statistical cluster analysis to classify OD markets into natural \"peer groups\" with the greatest intrinsic similarities. Subsequently, we model the year over year growth and volatility of OD markets within each peer group to estimate the risk and return properties of the OD markets. Lastly, we present two financial portfolio concepts and their application to airline network planning to illustrate that analysis of all the U.S. OD markets does not provide a one-size-fitsall solution for airline network planning.",

These metrics were selected as intrinsic OD attributes which define comparable \"peer groups\" with similar expectations of performance e for example, the fundamental drivers of revenue performance for large, high-yield ODs versus small, lowyield ODs are likely distinct (Belobaba, 2009 ).

Since 2000, high yield markets (i.e., Cluster 6) have consistently underperformed the industry in both passenger and revenue growth and stability. Cluster 6 comprises the markets most often lagging in both passenger and revenue growth and stability. Conversely, low yield markets (i.e., Cluster 5) have led passenger and revenue growth for most quarters since 2000 and frequently outperformed the industry averages for passenger volume and revenue volatility. By inspection, mid-sized markets (i.e., Clusters 3 and 4) also show higher than average growth and lower volatility than the largest U.S. domestic ODs (i.e., Cluster 7) which, as discussed previously, have accounted for the least revenue per passenger as compared to all other market types. Volatility reflects an OD's performance consistency and risk level, while growth rate illustrates relative industry performance. Such information on under-and over-performing peer groups is lost when data is aggregated across all OD markets. Note that passenger and revenue data for all quarters between 2000 and 2010 was consolidated using linear weighted averages to give more weight to revenue and passenger change in recent quarters. A simple average assumes that all quarters have equal weight in determining the performance in the next time step. Given the evolutional nature of the airline industry, the linear weighted average is used to emphasize recent history as a better indicator of short-term performance, while still considering long-term performance in light of industry volatility. Fig. 3 plots the revenue growth and passenger volume stability for all peer groups. The data show that high yield markets (i.e., Cluster 6) have experienced on average higher volatility and lower growth than all other peer groups. As noted previously, these high yield markets have consistently underperformed the industry over time in both passenger and revenue growth and stability.",

A common method to facilitate portfolio analysis is a growth-share matrix where the performance of products or companies is plotted with respect to their relative market share and market growth rate into four quadrants: split into high-low market share and high-low growth rate. Here we adapt the growthshare matrix concept to airline network planning. In order to assess performance within peer groups, we plot the OD markets within a peer group into four different quadrants based on the linear weighted averages of revenue growth and passenger volume stability to derive strategic implications for airline market portfolio development (Fig. 4) . We adapt the growth-share matrix from market share and market growth to revenue growth and passenger volume stability in order to measure the volatility of the OD markets. The bubble size represents an OD's total annual revenue to consider its scale. Similar to the growth-share matrix, the quadrants are defined using the industry-median passenger growth rate and volatility. Qualitatively, the quadrants can be summarized as follows, clock-wise from upper-left: < Niche: low volatility and low growth, low volatility markets which have limited profit expansion opportunities < Invest: high growth, low volatility markets which consistently outperform the industry < Question Marks: high growth, high volatility markets requiring careful consideration of profit potential < Divest: low growth, high volatility markets which consistently underperform the industry",

The Sharpe Ratio maintains an R 2 between .66 and .989 for each of the seven peer groups, verifying the efficacy of the Sharpe Ratio for airline network planning (Fig. 5) . The slope of the line between a plotted OD market and the origin is the Sharpe Ratio for that particular market. Hence all markets lying on the same line passing through the origin are considered equivalent to an investor or, in this case, a network planner. ",

Currently, forecasting/ demand models or market share models (e.g., Quality of Service Index) are developed using the entirety of networks and subsequently assume the applicability of the model to virtually any markets, regardless of its distinctive attributes. Understandably, retaining scores of models that capture the intricacies of all market types is infeasible and reduces the applicability of the models. OD market clustering identifies statistical peer groups that balance the need for generalizable models developed from a reliable number of observations with an appreciation for natural differences between market types. OD market clustering offers a method of presenting network planners with robust, yet intuitive insights to inform the strategic allocation of resources. A natural extension of this work is the development of market share models for each peer group. Given the variations in peer groups, it is apparent that the causal factors considered in traditional performance models (e.g., number of departures, number of international destinations, metropolitan statistical area income, etc.) will have varying impact and statistical significance across peer group-specific models. This approach allows network planners to, much like financial analysts, assess the potential performance of investment options based on readily available data.",
