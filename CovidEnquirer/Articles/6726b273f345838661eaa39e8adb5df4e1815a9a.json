The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Proteinprotein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. We used homology-based protein-protein : bioRxiv preprint 2 docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.",

Recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ACE2 6 receptor on the surface of the host cell using the spike protein and explored 7 the binary interaction of these two partners [4, 12, 28] . In this work, we 8 focused our analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main 9 subjects: (1) The architecture of the interface of the spike protein and 10 whether its evolution in many isolates supports an increase in affinity 11 toward the ACE2 receptor; (2) How the affinity of SARS-COV-2-RBD and 12 SARS-CoV-RBD toward different ACE2 homologous proteins from different 13 species is dictated by a divergent interface sequences (3); A comparison of 14 the interaction hotspots between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; and finally, 15 (4) whether any of the studied ACE2 variants may show a different binding 16 property compared to the reference allele. To tackle these questions we 17 used multiscale modelling approaches combined to sequence and phylogeny 18 analysis.",

The consistency of the topology, for the RBD sequences, 61 was assessed using a bootstrap method with 1000 replicates. The resulting 62 phylogenetic tree was edited with iTOL [13] . The co-crystal structure of the spike protein of SARS coronavirus com-66 plexed to human human-civet chimeric receptor ACE2 was solved at 3\u00c5of 67 resolution (PDB code 3SCL). We used this structure as a template to build 68 the complex of spike protein from different virus isolates with the human 69 ACE2 protein (Uniprot sequence Q9BYF1). The template sequences of the 70 ligand (spike protein) and the receptor (ACE2) were aligned locally with the 71 target sequences using the program Water from the EMBOSS package [16] . 72 Modeller version 9.22 [18] was then used to predict the complex model of 73 each spike protein with the ACE2 using a slow refining protocol. For each 74 model, we generated ten conformers from which we selected the model with 75 the best DOPE score [19] .",

            "text": "Since the Covid-2019 outbreak, several milestone papers have been published 187 to examine the particularity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its putative 188 interaction with ACE2 as a receptor [25, 26] . In the current study, we 189 focused our analysis on the interface segments of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD 190 interacting with ACE2 from different species by estimating interaction 191 energy profiles. 192 We have studied the effect of eight variants of ACE2 in order to detect 193 polymorphisms that may increase or decrease the virulence in the host. We 194 concluded that if ACE2 is the only route for the infection in humans, variants 195 interacting physically with RBD are not likely to disrupt the formation of 196 the complex and would have a marginal effect on the affinity. Therefore, it 197 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

However, this analysis merits to be investigated in depth in 199 different ethnic groups for a better assessment of the contribution of genetic 200 variability in host-pathogen interaction. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD 201 to different forms of ACE2 shows similar values compared to SARS-CoV 202 which is in agreement with the ability of the virus to cross the species barrier. 203 However, although we estimated low Kd value between SARS-CoV RBD 204 and Gallus gallus ACE2, there have been no reported cases of SARS-CoV 205 isolated from chicken. On the other hand, while Kd is high for SARS-CoV 206 RBD interacting with porcine ACE2, there are only few reported cases 207 of such type [20] . Indeed, host-pathogen interaction is a complex process 208 unlikely to be controlled only by the binding of the spike protein with 209 ACE2 [5] . For model animals where Kd values are very low, ACE2 analysis 210 may play a key role in targeting the main animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. 211 For high Kd values, other factors might regulate the infection including the 212 implication of different receptors or the response of the immune system but 213 that does not mean that the infection is unlikely to occur. On the other 214 hand, whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of the different isolates included 215 in this study is consistent with previous works that place the Wuhan-Hu-1 216 isolate close to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 isolates [14, 15, 22] 217 within the Betacoronavirus genus. The use of RBD sequences, however, 218 places the virus in a clade that comprises SARS-CoV related homologs 219 including isolates from Bat and Civet. The clade swapping as seen in 220 figure 1A , seems also to occur for RaTG13 and Rm1 isolated from bat. This 221 is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably 222 affect the topology of the tree. However, given the functional implication 223 of the spike RBD in host-pathogen infection, we have raised the question 224 about where the virus obtained its RBD binding interface. The binding of 225 the spike glycoprotein to ACE2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity. 226 In the case where the RBD evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of 227 Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, we expected a decrease of the 228 binding energy through the evolution process following incremental changes 229 in the RBD. In such a scenario, we presume that there are other intermediary 230 forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy to 231 reach a level where the pathogen can cross the species barriers and infect 232 .

On the other hand, our results 233 show that the binding energy and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 234 RBD are closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other 235 species). Therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that 236 might have occurred between SARS-CoV and an ancestral form of the 237 current SARS-CoV-2 virus might be also possible. This will allow for the 238 virus to acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hACE2. 239 The recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested 240 by Wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis [6] . Thereafter, incremental 241 changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a 242 better affinity toward the receptor. One of these changes may involve P499 243 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the 244 interface segment and has a distant effect. Moreover, the decomposition 245 of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in 246 SARS-CoV-2 have their equivalent in SARS-CoV including N501. Contrary 247 to what Wan et al [22] have stated, the single mutation N501T does not 248 seem to enhance the affinity. Rather, the residue Q493 might be responsible 249 for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the Van der Waals 250 by the longer polar side chain of asparagine. Indeed, when we made the 251 same analysis while mutating Q493 to N493, the favorable contribution 252 decreases from -2.55 kcal/mol to a non significant value of -0.01 kcal/mol, 253 thus supporting our claim.
