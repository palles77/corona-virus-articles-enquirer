Subsequently, because of passive antibody transfer, the offspring of these primed gilts were more efficient in surviving a lethal TGEV challenge. An average survival rate of 89% occurred in 6 litters of piglets from primed gilts that were boosted with 2.8 \u00d7 10 6 plaque forming units (PFU) of TGEV whereas 76% of the piglets survived in three litters that suckled primed gilts boosted with 3.0\u00d710 5 PFU of TGEV. Non-primed gilts given identical pre-farrowing doses of TGEV had litter survival rates of 63 and 55%, respectively. Moreover, both groups of litters from primed gilts suffered less clinical illness (as measured by the extent of weight loss post-challenge) than control litters. Priming of the piglets as neonates and boosting the pregnant gilts produced an anamnestic systemic immune response and correspondingly higher milk titers in the primed gilts compared to control animals. Thus, priming piglets with PRCV was beneficial in providing resistance to TGEV and could be incorporated into a vaccine strategy that yields better protection against TGEV.",

Other sites of TGEV replication include the respiratory tract and mammary gland but the virus is most easily isolated from intestinal contents and feces (Saif and Bohl, 1983; Saif and Wesley, 1999) .",

The ingestion of colostral and milk antibodies that neutralize TGEV and thus protect the susceptible epithelial cells of the small intestine is termed lactogenic immunity (Haelterman, 1965) . Frequent nursing by the piglets ensures a plentiful supply of passive antibody to neutralize the virus. Sows and gilts infected with virulent TGEV develop sufficient maternal antibodies (IgA and IgG) to protect nearly all of their offspring (Stone et al., 1977 ) while the efficacy of attenuated TGE vaccines is less efficient (Saif and Wesley, 1999) . Moreover, the dose of virulent virus is important in establishing adequate lactogenic immunity (Wesley, 2000) .",

PRC viruses are spontaneous deletion mutants of TGEV and these deletions have occurred with some frequency in Europe and in North America since the mid-1980s (Pensaert et al., 1986; Wesley et al., 1990; Britton et al., 1991; Vaughn et al., 1995; Kim et al., 2000) . A notable change between TGEVs and PRCVs is a large deletion in the N-terminal portion of the PRCV spike or S glycoprotein leading to a truncated S protein which may account for the different tissue tropisms of these viruses (Krempl et al., 1997; Sanchez et al., 1999) . Most of the antigenic sites on the PRCV S protein remain unchanged from those of the TGEV S protein so that an infection of pigs with PRCV induces similar neutralizing antibody titers for both PRCV and TGEV.",

In one study using specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs, prior infection with PRCV caused no reduction in the amount or duration of shedding of TGEV (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1989) . In contrast, a PRCV infection in weaned pigs of a similar age showed that PRCV-primed the humoral and local immune systems against TGEV and that a secondary antibody response was induced by the TGEV challenge (Cox et al., 1993) . Since young piglets are most susceptible to TGEV, this heightened immunity, therefore, would be beneficial for the litters of primed female pigs. Thus, the purpose of this study was to measure increases in protective passive immunity against TGEV in gilts that were primed with PRCV when they were 3-and 4-day-old neonates (Wesley, 2002) . These PRCV-primed gilts were boosted with a low oral dose of TGEV (doses that were insufficient to provide complete protection, Wesley, 2000) at 13-18 days prior to farrowing and their secondary antibody response and milk titers were measured. Also, litters of these primed and boosted gilts were challenged with TGEV and the clinical severity of disease and the percentage of surviving piglets was determined.",

Immunological memory, that lasted at least through the first parturition of these pigs (\u223c1 year), was shown by an anamnestic SN antibody response and an enhanced lactogenic response in both groups of primed gilts. The antibodies measured in milk were total VN antibodies and no specific measurement of sIgA was made. All primed gilts given either booster dose had a greater than 10-fold increase in SN titers in comparison to their corresponding control groups. Likewise, there was an anamnestic VN response in the milk titers of primed gilts but these increases were less than for the SN titers. On average, there was a 5-to 8-fold increase in milk VN titers of primed gilts compared to the primary VN response in the milk of control dams. Moreover, primed gilts had better immunity since they were efficient in resisting re-infection with TGEV due to contact exposure to their TGEV challenged litter. No primed gilts show seroconversion at 12 days post-challenge whereas the control dams had variable results, some having declining titers while others had stable or increasing titers due to re-infection. Thus, by infecting young pigs with PRCV, immunological memory is induced that is long lasting and can be beneficial in protecting pigs and piglets from TGEV.",

This observation simply could be in error because of the limited number of animals in the study. Indeed, in a previous experiment, non-primed gilts experienced inappetence but no diarrhea when given the same TGEV inoculum in a similar dose range (Wesley, 2000) . Moreover, pigs having recovered from TGEV are resistant to subsequent re-infection with the virus, and thus, lack clinical signs (Cox et al., 1993; VanCott et al., 1994; Saif and Wesley, 1999) . However, the duration of this resistance has not been reported for the approximate 1-year time interval used in this study. Perhaps one possibility with PRCV-primed gilts is that the booster dose of TGEV may have an additional inflammatory component in the intestinal tract resulting in more apparent clinical signs. In this regard a respiratory infection with PRCV has been shown to stimulate antibody secreting cells that not only localize to the respiratory tract but also lodge in the gut associated lymphoid tissue (VanCott et al., 1994) .",

In these piglets partial protective immunity was established in 6 days and SN antibodies also were detected by day 6 post-exposure to PRCV. In the current study neonatal piglets were infected similarly with PRCV and SN titers of the primed pigs decayed over the course of the year following infection. These pigs had immunological memory since they developed a secondary immune response after booster exposure to TGEV and they transferred passive protective antibodies to their offspring. Additionally, Lanza et al. (1995) and Sestak et al. (1996) have shown that PRCV can induce immunological memory in older pigs. Sows in these studies were immunized with PRCV prior to their first parturition and again before their second parturition. These sows retained immunologic memory because there was a secondary humoral and lactogenic immune response, particularly increases in sIgA, that yielded better protection for their TGEV challenged offspring.",

For the litters of PRCV-primed gilts, the percent survival ranged from 50 to 100% at the higher dose and from 68 to 100% for only three litters at the lower dose. The survival rates in corresponding control litters ranged from 30 to 100% at the higher dose and from 9 to 90% at the lower dose. Chi-square probability distributions were used to evaluate the overall survival percentages. Even when litter size variations were taken into account (Rao and Scott, 1992) , the overall percent survival of litters from PRCV-primed gilts was significant (P < 0.05) when compared to the survival rates of corresponding control litters. In contrast, at the lower booster dose, 3 \u00d7 10 5 PFU, survival rates for litters of primed versus control gilts were not significant (P < 0.45).",

Thus, in the primed dams, the threshold of TGEV needed to induce protective immunity for their offspring is lower. Most likely, even a commercial, modified-live TGEV vaccine given orally to PRCV-primed gilts would provide superior protection for their offspring via lactogenic immunity.",
