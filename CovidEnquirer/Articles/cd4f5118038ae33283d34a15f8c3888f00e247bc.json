Coronaviruses broadly infect vertebrates including humans, birds, bats, snakes, mice and other wild animals [1, 2] . Since the mid-1960s, seven known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified [3, 4] . Four commonly detected HCoVs are 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. In one study, 229E and OC43 accounted for approximately 15 [3, 5] . Another epidemiological study in adults estimates that coronavirus causes about 15% of common colds [6] . Other significant causes of upper respiratory infections include influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Group A Streptococci, EBV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",

SARS-CoV caused a total of 8422 probable SARS cases, 919 SARS-related deaths (case-fatality rate: 11%) and spread to 32 different countries or regions between November 2002 and August 2003 [9] . Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has infected 73,230 people and caused 1871 deaths (case-fatality rate: 2.6%) and has spread to 25 countries, according to the State Council Information Office in Beijing, China (updated as of Feb. 17, 2020) [10] .

The virus is thought to be transmitted to other people by respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing. Droplet spread can occur when an infected person sneezes or coughs, whereupon virus containing droplets are propelled up to 3 feet through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. A recent report suggests that transmission through the ocular surface is also possible [24] . The other avenues for the spread of the virus are shaking hands with an infected person, touching an infected object/surface, frequent touching of the nose or mouth or coming into contact with a patient's excreta. Another avenue is through \"hidden transmission\" [19] , in which asymptomatic infected individuals or carriers unknowingly transmit the virus to unsuspecting contacts.",

Three months later, the SARS pandemic was rapidly and globally disseminated due to person-to-person transmission of the virus. On the February 21, 2003, a medical professor from Foshan in Guangdong province who was considered a \"super-spreader\" went to Hong Kong to visit his relatives. During his stay in Hong Kong, he transmitted the virus to 2 family members, 4 health care workers (HCWs) and 12 other nearby residents. Because of international travel and transmission to HCWs, these patients spread the SARS-CoV to Hong Kong and other countries including Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. Eventually, 8422 people were infected in 32 countries and 919 (11%) died [9] . In China, 5328 cases were reported and 349 (6.5%) perished between November 16, 2002 and June 3, 2003 [9] .",

Beijing experienced the largest outbreak of SARS beginning on the March 5, 2003. The outbreak peaked within 6 weeks on the April 25, 2003 when 173 newly suspected SARS cases were hospitalized daily [46] . On the June 20, 2003, the last batch of 18 SARS patients recovered and were discharged from hospital, signaling the end of the pandemic in Beijing. The prompt resolution of the outbreak in Beijing was attributed to the rapid adoption of a series of effective control measures.",

Large quantities of emergency supplies including personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical apparat were sent to front-line medical sectors. These people and materials were key to winning the war against SARS. 2. More than 100 fever clinics were set up in all secondary and tertiary hospitals in Beijing. People visiting the fever clinics had a physical examination including body temperature, white blood cell count and chest radiograph. Fever clinics played an important role in screening and triage. 3. All actively ill patients with SARS were concentrated in designated hospital wards. On the May 1, 2003, a new 1000-bed SARS hospital (Xiaotangshan Hospital, Beijing) was built and put into operation immediately. The advantages of having such a facility was that it was more conducive to the centralized management of SARS patients, and at the same time, it reduced transmission of the virus to healthy people. 4. During the period of the SARS outbreak, more than 60,000 HCWs received medical training in the management of patients with SARS, infection control and the use of PPE. 5. Multiple measures were taken to reduce person-to-person transmission, including isolation of patients with SARS, tracing and quarantine of close contacts, transit site surveillance and closing poorly maintained facilities that could enhance spread of the virus. 6. Information dissemination was critical. Timely and accurate reporting of the status of the epidemic and scientific guidance on prevention and infection control played important roles in stabilizing people and overcoming the epidemic [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

For patients with underlying diseases, attention should be paid to the detection of invasive fungal infections.

The use of detection kits can accelerate accurate diagnosis of patients, help to determine quarantine and isolation requirements, assist in determining the treatment of patients and save limited medical resources. However, the rapidity of spread of the disease has led to an insufficient supply of detection kits. It is worth noting that there have been confirmed patients whose viral nucleic acid tests are negative multiple times in the early stages, and there have also been confirmed cases whose throat swabs were negative for the viral nucleic acid test but positive in alveolar lavage fluid. Correlation of Chest CT and RT-PCR testing of 1014 cases showed that CT had a 88% had a positive CT scan but only 59% had positive RT-PCR. [86] . The poor sensitivity of the current tests makes diagnosis and epidemic control more challenging. Sampling techniques, extraction and detection of viral nucleic acids, and diagnostic reagents may affect the test results. More attention should be paid to the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic reagents, and diagnostic decisions should rely on comprehensive judgment based on the clinical manifestations, laboratory results and imaging examinations of patients.

In recent decades, there has been increasing evidence suggesting that \"pyroptosis\" is a novel inflammatory form of programmed cell death. In 2019, Chen et al. found that SARS-CoV Viroporin 3a triggered the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting SARS-CoV induced cell pyroptosis [89] . Studies have shown that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have increased IL-1\u03b2 in the serum [26] . As the rise of IL-1\u03b2 is a downstream indicator of cell pyroptosis, this may suggest that cell pyroptotic activity is likely to be activated and involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, as both classical and nonclassical pyroptosis signaling can induce the release of IL-1\u03b2, it is unclear which pathway is involved in COVID-19. Based on existing data, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to cause cell pyroptosis, especially in lymphocytes, through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. The pathways involved in the activation of the signaling between NLRP3m IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and GSDMD are illustrated in Fig. 6 and are a subject of study in samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients [90] .",

This rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recombination event [94, 96] . Even though there are high similarities between SARS-CoV-2 S and RaTG13 S, there are two distinct differences: one is an \"RRAR\" furin recognition site formed by an insertion residues in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2, rather than the single Arginine in SARS-CoV [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] ; the other difference is the presence of 29 variant residues between SARS-CoV-2 S and RaTG13 S, 17 of which mapped to the receptor binding domain (RBD) [97] . The identities of 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-UTR sequences are more than 83.6% consistent between SARS-CoV-2 and other \u03b2-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV [102] . The replicase polyproteins ppla and pp1ab encoded by the largest genes orf1ab are proteolytic and have been reported to function in the replication of CoVs by regulatory elements located within the nonstructural proteins [102] . Four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) contribute to virion assembly and infection of CoVs. The spike protein located on the surface of viral particles is made up of homotrimers of S proteins and is the key for the viral attachment to host receptors [103, 104] .",

Furthermore, the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved and shares 99% similarity with those of Bat-SL-CoVZC45, Bat-SL-CoVZC21 and human SARS-CoV [102] . The S2 subunit is therefore targeted when screening broad spectrum antiviral peptides, which is an important piece of information that can be used to develop preventive and treatment measures. Most recently, the 3D structure of S protein was elucidated using Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), and the RBD structure of the S protein is closer to the central location of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV [97] .",

Hoffmann et al. found that the cellular protease MPRSS2 blocks entry by cleaving the spike protein and may constitute a treatment option [118] . Zhou et al. also confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is able to use all but mouse ACE2 as an entry receptor for ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2, indicating that the cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 could be ACE2, and not other coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [94] . Huang also showed that the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD binding to ACE2 is less than that of SARS-CoV contains 10 nsps (nsp1-nsp10) . The pp1ab protein also includes nsp12-nsp16.",

Wuhan has also been building 11 mobile Fangcang hospitals (a Chinese name which came from Noah's Ark) and creating tens of thousands of beds, to centralize quarantine and provide medical treatment for confirmed patients with mild symptoms, suspected patients and those who need observation. The new facilities further enhance the local public health capacities. Hospitals offer online consultants and medical services to symptomatic patients and suspected patients, which help reduce the frequency that patients go to hospitals and thereby reduce the risk of being infected. Health care workers, including military medical teams, from across the Chinese mainland arrived in Hubei to provide much needed assistance. At present, more than 30,000 health care workers have arrived in Hubei to help fight the novel coronavirus epidemic.

In addition, actively mobilizing the population to participate in epidemic prevention and control is critical, and this can be achieved by accurate information dissemination and ongoing updates. Real-time updating the information of the epidemic situation can help to alleviate panic and reduce societal anxiety. A strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines. Big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information, conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks. Last but not least, use of the Internet and the media to conduct health education for the people, publicize the correct knowledge of prevention, and offer online consultation to guide patients to seek medical treatment correctly are additional strategies that can be implemented to achieve viral containment.",

This not only involves quarantining measures within China but also internationally, as countries canceled flights into China, quarantined their own nationals as they returned from China and installed thermal scanners to detect ill people. But the quarantine measures inside China are certainly eye-opening. The entire city of Wuhan was shut off, and this was extended to every other city in China. In effect, the entire country was told to stay home, creating an enormous impact on the economy and on people's daily lives. Roads and stores became deserted (Fig. 10) . In Ningbo, each household was only permitted to send one person out for groceries every other day. Schools were closed till the end of March. Everyone wears masks. The objective was to starve the virus, to eliminate hosts. Yet even with these measures, new cases continued to appear. The quarantine measures in China have obviously come under a great deal of scrutiny, with so called \"experts\" weighing in, some saying that it will not work, that isolating a city deprives it of medical resources. Whatever the criticism, it is humbling to think of what may have happened without these draconian measures. It is also difficult to comprehend if such measures could actually take place in other parts of the world, or if the implementation of these changes could have taken place as quickly. For example, hand shaking is not part of Chinese culture, but it is almost automatic in other parts of the world, and it is normally done without even thinking. This is the first thing that would have to stop to help contain the virus.",

At the present time, it is difficult to say whether or not the response could have been faster than it actually was, as this corresponds to the time when work began on viral sequencing. It is possible that medical teams were already working on the sequence at that time. It is also quite possible that officials did not initially sound the alarm publicly because they did not want to cause a panic. Perhaps this was the wrong decision, but these decisions are difficult in times of crisis and it is of course easy to second guess. It is easy to understand that this can be perceived as withholding information and why the public would be frustrated. The lesson here is that dissemination of accurate and validated information and establishing guidelines to prevent the spread of infections is critical.",
