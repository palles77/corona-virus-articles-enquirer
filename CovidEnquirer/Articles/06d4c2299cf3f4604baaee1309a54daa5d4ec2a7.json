The most appropriate blood transfusion therapy should provide for the missing or reduced element. Transfusion of whole blood can be life-saving in situations such as massive blood loss due to trauma or extensive surgery. Blood component therapy is used to treat conditions in which the specific element is missing; for example, severe anemia (a reduction in oxygen supply to vital organs) or an abnormal decrease in the number of platelets. People suffering from sickle-cell disease may require frequent transfusion of red cell concentrates. In the case of hemophilia, the administration of the missing clotting factor is required.

After unsuccessful transfusions of blood from animals to humans, and sometimes from humans to humans as well, it was only after 1900, when Karl Landsteiner discovered the ABO major blood groups, that blood transfusion therapy became possible. The history of blood transfusion has shown that once the blood group compatibility barrier had been overcome, there are infectious threats to which increased attention must be given. Blood-borne pathogens can be transferred with the donor's blood to the recipient patient. Such pathogens may be viruses (e.g., HIV/ AIDS, hepatitis B and C), parasites (e.g., malaria, Chagas' disease), bacteria (e.g., syphilis, brucellosis), or prions (e.g., vCJD).",

According to the WHO global database for blood safety, 81 million units of whole blood and 20 million liters of plasma were donated annually in the period 2001-2002. Analysis of blood donations in relation to the human development index (HDI -United Nations indicators) showed that 82% of the world's population, which lives in low and medium HDI countries, has access to only 39% of the total blood supply. This limited access has a dramatic impact on the capacity to respond to various health needs of the population, and the strong links between blood availability and maternal mortality rates have been demonstrated. The differences in blood donation rates reflect not only the degree of awareness of the population with respect to blood transfusion, but also the level of development of health care in which the blood service is embedded. With mounting safety requirements and technological progress, blood transfusion services have become an increasingly expensive part of public health. In countries with restricted resources, the safety of blood transfusion is of particular concern, especially because these countries often have high prevalence rates of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other particular blood-borne diseases. (See Relevant Websites for the WHO global database on blood safety.)

This has generated enhanced work of national and international organizations to support both the development and implementation of quality and safety standards for the blood services and deliverables (e.g., Council of Europe ''Guide to the Preparation, Use and Quality Assurance of Blood Components,'' AABB Standard for Blood Banks). These standards are all grounded in more general standards, such as the ISO 9000series standards and the current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) guidelines for medicinal products for human and veterinary use (e.g., EU published by the European Commission). These specify basic requirements and principles for quality management, including personnel management and training, premises and equipment layout, production operations and requirements for standard operating procedures, design and methods for ensuring maintenance and documentation for all activities, how to perform quality controls, contract manufacture and analysis, and how to perform and document self-inspection.

However, the development of national hemovigilance systems poses increasing challenges due to the various taxonomies in use, the limited resources for supportive informative technologies, and, mainly, the need for enhanced communication between blood services and hospital services. The increasing role of the patient in this process is expected to strengthen hemovigilance at its operational level. Several websites provide data on hemovigilance (national and regional), such as those from the United Kingdom, the European Haemovigilance Network, and the Danish Haemovigilance Network. ",
