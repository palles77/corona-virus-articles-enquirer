Astrocytes, the major glial cell population of the central nervous system, were semipermissive for GDVII virus replication. Programmed cell death, demonstrated by apoptosis-specific caspase-3 protease activity, was maximal 8 h after GDVII infection at an m.o.i. of 1. Purified TMEV capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 did not induce apoptosis but antibodies to VP1 and VP2 inhibited it. Antibody inhibition of caspase-3 activity as well as flow cytometry experiments implicated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-\u2423-receptor (TNF-R) in apoptosis signaling. Converselly, TNF-\u2423 and the TRAIL-receptor were not upregulated. Furthermore, the number of functional TNF-\u2423 receptors, but not their affinity, was increased in apoptotic GDVII virus-infected astrocytes, as confirmed in binding experiments with 125 I-labeled recombinant murine TNF-\u2423.",

The ability of GDVII virus to induce apoptosis was assessed based on changes in caspase-3 activity, an enzyme with substrate specificity for the amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Va1-Asp (Nicholson et al., 1995) , since this enzyme is the main executioner caspase in a cascade of proteolytic cleavage events in dying cells. Astrocyte cultures infected at m.o.i.s of 1, 10, and 100 showed a significant increase in caspase-3 activity in comparison with mock-infected cultures (P \u03fd 0.05) (Fig. 2 ). This induction was specific since caspase-3 activity in cells infected at an m.o.i. of 10 and treated with 50 M Z-VAD-FMK, the irreversible pancaspase inhibitor, was not appreciably greater than that in mock-infected cultures. Caspase-3-specific activity was calculated based on a calibration curve using known amounts of chromophore p-nitroaniline (pNA), released from the sustrate upon cleavage by the enzyme. Specific activity was calculated as picomoles of pNA liberated per hour per microgram of cell lysate extracts using the formula provided with the CaspACE kit. Mean specific activities were 96.5 \u03ee 4.9 pmol/g for GDVII-infected astrocytes and 24.3 \u03ee 1.6 Analysis of the kinetics of caspase-3 induction in astrocyte cultures infected at an m.o.i. of 10 for periods ranging from 0 to 48 h revealed rapid induction of activity (4 h) that peaked after 8 h and decreased by 48 h (Fig. 3) . We found around 30% of dead cells when the cultures were observed under phase-contrast microscopy at optimal conditions for apoptosis induction (i.e., 8 h at an m.o.i. of 1).",

None of the purified proteins induced significant caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5 ). The slight induction by VP2 might reflect some residual intact virus contamination in this particular preparation. Because the TMEV attachment site resides in a structure composed of both VP1 and VP3 proteins (Tyler, 1987) , these two purified proteins were added together, as well as the three isolated proteins, without any appreciable induction of apoptosis (not shown). The lack of apoptosis inducing capability of the low-virulence BeAn strain in astrocytic cells is once more demonstrated (Fig. 5 , BeAn).",

Astrocytes were the cellular source of signals since potential contamination by microglia, oligodendrocytes, neurons, or meningeal fibroblast was carefully ruled out in our cultures.

After centrifugation, cells were filtered through a 40 m nylon cell strainer (Falcon-Becton-Dickinson, Le Pont De Claix, France) and cultured in 25-cm 2 tissue culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at 37\u00b0C. The medium was changed after 4 days in culture and subsequently two times a week for the entire culture period. Cultures were enriched in astrocytes by the removal of less adherent microglia and oligodendrocytes by shaking overnight at 37\u00b0C and 250 rpm in a table-top shaker (Thermo Forma, Marietta, OH). Cellular confluence was observed 10 days after plating, producing around 3 \u03eb 10 6 cells per flask, showing a polygonal flat morphology. A mean of 98% astrocytes was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining of methanol-fixed cultures using rabbit antiglial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) antiserum (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) . The lack of noticeable mature oligodendrocytes and microglial/macrophage cells was determined using a guinea pig antimyelin basic protein (MBP) antiserum prepared as described elsewhere (Rubio et al., 1990) and monoclonal anti-Mac-1 antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK). Secondary fluorescein-labeled antibodies were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).",
