The purified SARS-CoV rNP was used as an antigen for detection of SARS-CoV antibodies in IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA was evaluated in comparison with neutralizing antibody assay and the authentic SARS-CoV antigen-based IgG ELISA. Two-hundred and seventy-six serum samples were collected from health care workers in a hospital in which a nosocomial SARS outbreak took place and used for evaluation. The SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA has 92% of sensitivity and specificity compared with the neutralizing antibody assay and 94% sensitivity and specificity compared with the authentic SARS-CoV antigen-based IgG ELISA. The results suggest that the newly developed SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and seroepidemiological study of SARS. The SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA has an advantage over the conventional IgG ELISA in that the antigen can be prepared by laboratory workers without the risk of infection.",

We developed a recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based IgG ELISA and confirmed that the ELISA had a higher than 90% sensitivity and specificity in detecting IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV compared with neutralizing antibody assay, the gold standard method, and with the authentic SARS-CoV Ag-based IgG ELISA (Fig. 2) . There was a positive correlation between the OD 405 values in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA and the neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, sequential change in OD 405 in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers in 19 subjects, in whom sero-conversion was demonstrated, was evaluated (Fig. 3) . Four of the 19 had already had antibody to SARS-CoV rNP detectable by SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA, although at this stage they had not yet had a neutralizing antibody equal to or over 20. On the other hand, only one serum sample that showed a positive reaction in neutralizing antibody assay at a titer of 20 showed a negative reaction in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that this SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA is as sensitive as the neutralizing antibody assay. Therefore, it can be concluded that the newly developed SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA is useful for the serological diagnosis of and seroepidemiological study on SARS-CoV infections.",

There have been several reports on the SARS-CoV rNP-based serological diagnostic system (Chan et al., 2005; Guan et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2003; Shi et al., 2003; Woo et al., 2004) . Lin et al. (2003) first reported that SARS-CoV rNP would be one of the candidates for the antigen to detect SARS-CoV antibodies. They confirmed that three of the nine serum samples collected from the patients clinically diagnosed as having SARS showed a positive reaction in SARS-CoV rNP-based Western blotting. The SARS-CoV rNP was then expressed in an E. coli system and used as antigen in an antigen-capturing ELISA. It was reported that the antigen-capturing ELISA had high specificity of about 98%, though the sensitivity was not evaluated in the study . Recently, Guan et al. also reported the efficacy of the recombinant protein of SARS-CoV-based IgG ELISA in diagnosis of SARS . The SARS-CoV rNP was also expressed in E. coli transformed with an expression vector. However, these systems were not compared with the neutralizing antibody assay that is considered to be a gold standard.",
