This can possibly be explained as poultry meat and eggs represent an efficient source of protein and have low cost of production in comparison with other sources of protein, such as pork and beef (Service, 2013) . Nowadays almost every world region (Africa, North and Central America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) has to improve their production systems to accomplish the global demand of richer and more nutritional diets. Besides, global trading of poultry products has also increased, especially between the major producers (i.e., the United States, Brazil, and China) and the rest of the world (Stenhouse, 2008) .",

OPs compounds, such as diazinon, fenthion, and parathion, cause locomotor and respiratory muscular weakness, dyspnea, and paralysis. Carbamate anticholinesterase insecticides (bofuran, methomyl, and bendiocarb) produce similar clinical signs to the OPs, but it is more acute with marked tremors and convulsions. Finally, another insecticide widely used is the pyrethroid (permethrin, cypermethrin, and deltamethrin); however, they are very secure and only rarely cause toxicity. Clinical signs of hyperactivity, tremor, and salivation are observed in the affected birds.",
