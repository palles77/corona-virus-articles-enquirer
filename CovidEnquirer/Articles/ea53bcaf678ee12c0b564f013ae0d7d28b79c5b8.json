Plaque assays indicated that none of the three peptides inhibited PEDV infection; however, rabbit anti-PEDV decreased vial infectivity by more than 50% when the dilutions were reduced from 1:64 to 1:4. When Vero cells were pre-treated with peptide (cell pretreatment assay) prior to virus infection (Fig. 1B) , little changes in virus titers were observed between the control and peptide treatment groups; some small effects were observed with the rabbit anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies. Finally, in the virus pretreatment assays where PEDV was incubated with peptides prior to cell infection (Fig. 1C) , the results indicated that both peptides H and S inhibited PEDV infectivity where EC 50 values were approximately 1 \u03bcg/ml and 62.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively.

When peptide H and PEDV were co-incubated with Vero cell at 4 1C for 1 h before shifting to 37 1C (binding only), this allowed us to measure peptide H effects on early-and pre-attachment of the virus. Results showed that PEDV pre-treated with peptide H exhibited slightly higher inhibition (p 40.05) than when peptide H and PEDV were co-incubated with cells absent a pre-incubation step (Fig. 6B) suggesting that there is a direct effect of peptide H on pre-attachment. Little to no inhibition of infection was observed once the virus became attached to the cell surface. Furthermore, when the peptides and PEDV were co-incubated with Vero cells at 37 1C absent any preincubation step, no effective inhibition of cell infection was observed (Fig. 6C ). To characterize the temperature effect on interactions between peptide H and PEDV as well as cell infection, various concentrations of the peptides were incubated with PEDV (PFU \u00bc5 \u00c2 10 3 /ml) at 4 1C or 37 1C for 1 h, then the peptide-treated viruses were used to infect cells at 37 1C.

It is known that pAPN is a cellular receptor for TGEV and that anti-pAPN antibody efficiently decreases cell infection by this virus (Delmas et al., 1992; Liu et al., 2009) . Recently, three pAPN-binding peptides H, S, and F were identified using pAPN as an immobilized target for panning a 12-mer phage display peptide library. These peptides exhibited high affinity binding to pAPN and inhibited cell infection by TGEV completely . As a member of group I coronaviruses, TGEV and PEDV have similar infection characterizations and as such it is difficult to differentiate these pathogens based only upon clinical symptoms. Recent evidence indicates that PEDV may also bind pAPN, a type II glycoprotein, as a functional receptor (Li et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2003) . Interestingly, TGEV can be easily propagated in swine-originated cells such as ST cells (Delmas et al., 1992; Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) whereas PEDV is adapted and cultivated in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells rather swine cells. Given the stark similarities as well as differences between TGEV and PEDV, we were interested in evaluating the antiviral effects of the H, S and F peptides on cell infection by PEDV.",

Therefore, we used PrV as an additional control to further confirm and evaluate the inhibition specificity of the H peptide. Peptide H did not prevent infection of pretreated TGEV or PrV suggesting its inhibitory activity was specific and not due to virucidal effects of amphipathic peptides. Clearly, peptide H was able to interact with PEDV; however, it was unclear as to the mechanism of its antiviral activity. As such, the binding characteristics between peptide H (using the phage bearing the H peptide) and PEDV were further examined by Western blot. Results clearly showed that phage H reacted with a protein with a molecular mass of 220 kDa closely approximating the molecular mass of the PEDV S protein. This supposition was corroborated using antibody against the PEDV S protein. In contrast, control phages bearing other peptides did not show such reactivity. These results demonstrate that the peptide H abrogates infectivity in part by binding to the PEDV S protein. This is consistent with the function of the coronavirus S protein that mediates cell infection. Further, cell post-treatment assays evaluating the effects of each peptide on the replication of PEDV in vitro Relative amplification of the PEDV X-N gene in the infected cells was normalized to that of beta-actin and calculated using the 2 \u00c0 \u0394\u0394Ct method. Peptide concentrations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 0 \u03bcg/ml, 15.625 \u03bcg/ml, 31.25 \u03bcg/ml, 62.5 \u03bcg/ml, 125 \u03bcg/ml, 250 \u03bcg/ml, respectively; line 7 is cell control group.

This was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR which showed decreasing amounts of viral RNA in PEDV-infected cells. This corroborated the relationship between the antiviral activity of peptide H and either blockage of the viral attachment or entry into Vero cells. The impact of peptide H on the entry of PEDV was first investigated by performing the cell post-treatment and co-incubation assays. When PEDV was incubated with cells prior to treatment with peptide H no significant effects on PEDV infection were observed. Similar results were seen when peptides, PEDV and the cells were combined at the same time and co-incubated at 37 1C suggesting that peptide H did not affect PEDV entry into the cell postadsorption. However, when PEDV was pre-incubated with peptide H prior to incubation with Vero cells, peptide H blocked the attachment of PEDV as determined from plaque assays and RT-PCR analysis.",

As such, we selected TGEV and PrV as control viruses to examine any specificity in the inhibitory activity of peptide H on cell infection by these viruses. As expected, the results showed no significant inhibitory activity of peptide H on either TGEV or PrV infection. Further, peptide H was not cytotoxic to either ST or Vero cells. These results corroborate our hypothesis that peptide H functions in part, by interacting with the S protein of PEDV and affecting the ability of the virus to bind to the cell surface. Future studies will focus on identifying the specific site of interaction of peptide H and whether or not such a peptide can be used in vivo to abrogate or attenuate PEDV infections.",

The expression of PEDV X-N in PEDV-infected Vero cells was normalized to that of beta-actin and taken as 100% compared to expression of the peptide H treatment group. Data analysis is based on the measurement of the cycle threshold (Ct). The difference in \u0394Ct (Ct sample fragment mean Ct value-beta-actin fragment mean Ct value) was used as a measure of the relative fragment with the 2 \u00c0 \u0394\u0394Ct method in correlation to the amplification size of PEDV X-N fragment. For each experimental condition, real-time PCR was conducted in quadruplicate and the resulting average Ct values for the PEDV X-N fragment was used to quantify viral load. The experiment was performed in triplicate.",
