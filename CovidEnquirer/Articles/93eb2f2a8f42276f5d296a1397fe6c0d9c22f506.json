            "text": "The medical records of 62 cats with clinical signs of central nervous system disease and accompanying inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were examined retrospectively to determine if signalment, clinical signs, CSF analysis and ancillary testing could accurately predict the type of central nervous system disease that was present. An inflammatory CSF was defined as one in which a total nucleated cell count was greater than 5 cells/ml or one in which the total nucleated cell count was normal but the nucleated cell differential count was abnormal. Sex, degree of CSF inflammation, neuroanatomical location and systemic signs provided little contributory information to the final diagnosis. In 63% of the cases a presumptive diagnosis could be made based on a combination of clinical signs, clinicopathological data and ancillary diagnostic tests. CSF analysis alone was useful only in the diagnosis of cats with feline infectious peritonitis, Cryptococcus species infection, lymphoma and trauma. Overall, despite extensive diagnostic evaluation, a specific diagnosis could not be made in 37% of cats. The prognosis for cats with inflammatory CSF was poor with 77% of cats surviving less than 1 year. I nflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) is common in cats of all ages. Despite this, few attempts have been made to evaluate how well cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, clinical signs and other clinicopathological data correlate with the disease occurring in the CNS. Causes of CNS inflammation in cats include viral, protozoal, fungal, parasitic and bacterial infection, 'immune mediated' and 'idiopathic' disorders of uncertain aetiology (eg, non-suppurative and eosinophilic meningoencephalitis) (Munana 2001) . In addition to primary inflammatory CNS disorders, there are diseases that can induce CNS inflammation secondary to tissue damage and necrosis. Such diseases include neoplasia, trauma, intervertebral disc disease, cerebrovascular disease and nutritional disorders (eg, thiamine deficiency). The purpose of this study was to determine if signalment, clinical signs, CSF analysis, additional clinicopathological data and diagnostic imaging could be used to determine the specific aetiology of the CNS disease in cats with inflammatory CSF. Prognosis for the various disease classifications was also evaluated.",

            "text": "Records were searched at three referral centres in Sydney, NSW from January 1995 to December 2002 for cats that had CSF analysis. CSF collection was performed in 111 cats. Of these, 62 cats could be classified as having inflammatory CNS disease. CSF was collected by percutaneous puncture from either the cerebello-medullary cistern or via lumbar puncture from either the L5eL6 or L4eL5 intervertebral space. CSF analysis included total white cell count and red cell count by haemocytometer, cytomorphology by stained sediment (Idexx Laboratories Pty Ltd) or stained cytocentrifuge smears (The University of Sydney Department of Clinical Pathology) and total protein by evaluation of microprotein on a commercial biochemistry autoanalyser (Olympus AU 400, Idexx Laboratories; Cobas Mira, The University of Sydney Department of Clinical Pathology). The reference ranges used by our laboratories for feline CSF were: white cell count %5 cells/ml, red cell count 0 cells/ml and total protein !0.3 g/l (Canfield and Martin 1998, Raskin and Myer 2001 ). An inflammatory CSF analysis was defined as one in which a total nucleated cell count was greater than 5 cells/ml or one in which the total nucleated cell count was normal but the nucleated cell differential count was abnormal (O9% neutrophils, O1% eosinophils) (Canfield and Martin 1998, Raskin and Myer 2001) . CSF nucleated cell counts were classified as: 1, normal: %5 cells/ml; 2, mildly elevated: 6e50 cells/ml; 3, moderately elevated: 51e1000 cells/ml and 4, markedly elevated: O1000 cells/ml. The nucleated cell population was classified as: 1, suppurative: O50% neutrophils; 2, non-suppurative: O80% mononuclear cells; 3, eosinophilic: O50% eosinophils and 4, mixed: no predominance of any one cell type (Canfield and Martin 1998, Raskin and Myer 2001) . CSF total protein was classified as 1, normal: %0.3 g/l; 2, mildly elevated: 0.31e10 g/ l; 3, moderately elevated: 11e20 g/l and markedly elevated: O20 g/l. CSF erythrocyte counts were classified as: 1, normal: 0 cells/ml; 2, mildly elevated: 1e49 cells/ml; 3, moderately elevated 50e1000 cells/ml and 4, markedly elevated: O1000 cells/ml (Table 1 ). The contribution of CSF red cell contamination to the total CSF white cell count was corrected for by subtracting 1 nucleated cell for every 100 red cells (Rand et al 1990) . Cats with CSF nucleated cell count that was less than or equal to that predicted from blood contamination were excluded from the study.",

The diagnosis was confirmed at necropsy in eight cats and on surgical biopsy in one other (83% of the cases). The remaining two cats had a diagnosis of FIP made based on ancillary diagnostic tests (serum and body cavity effusion albumin:globulin ratio !0.5, and elevated FeCoV antibody titre in serum and body cavity effusions). The ages ranged from 4 months to 11 years of age with a median of 12 months. Breed distribution did not differ from the total population of cats studied. The most common neurological signs were gait abnormalities in seven cats and reduced mentation in three cats. Systemic signs included pyrexia in six cats, lethargy in three cats, ocular abnormalities in six cats and weight loss in four cats. Four cats had an abdominal effusion and one cat a pleural effusion. Ten cats had clinical signs consistent with multifocal lesions of the central nervous system. These were referrable to a combination of cerebral cortex and brainstem (often central vestibular) signs. One cat had cerebellar signs only. CSF analysis was characterised as suppurative in seven cats, mixed in one and mononuclear in three. Five cats had a marked elevation in the CSF white cell count (O1000 cells/ml), three cats had moderate elevations (51e1000 cells/ml), two cats had mild elevations (6e50 cells/ml) and one cat had insufficient sample for a white cell count. Seven cats had increased CSF protein concentrations. Four cats had a mild elevation (0.31e10 g/l), one cat had a moderate elevation (11e20 g/l) and two cats had marked elevations (O20 g/l). Two cats had normal CSF protein concentrations and two cats did not have CSF protein concentrations measured because of insufficient sample. All 11 cats had haematology and serum biochemistry preformed. Six cats had a mild, non-regenerative anaemia and three cats had a mild-moderate mature neutrophilia. No cat was lymphopenic. Ten cats had elevated serum globulin concentrations, two had elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and one cat had an elevated bilirubin concentration. Of the two cats without a histopathological diagnosis, one had a serum FeCoV antibody titre of 1:800 and an FeCoV antibody titre in ascitic fluid of 1:800.

A previous study (Rand et al 1994b) failed to demonstrate any significant difference in CSF parameters between cats diagnosed with primary inflammatory, degenerative, or neoplastic disease of the CNS. This may reflect the presence of secondary inflammation and degeneration associated with many CNS disorders. Categorising CSF as 'inflammatory' depends on a number of factors such as the method of collection (particularly peripheral blood contamination), laboratory reference ranges, loss of cells in CSF due to delays between sample collection and analysis and experience of the technician interpreting the sample. To control these variables, all the reference ranges chosen were those used by the laboratories involved in processing the sample. All samples were evaluated by an experienced veterinary pathologist within 1 h of collection.",

Normal CSF should not contain any erythrocytes, however up to 30 red blood cells (RBCs/ml) is considered 'normal' contamination as it does not have a significant effect on the CSF white cell count (Rand et al 1990) . Correcting for peripheral blood contamination using the ratio of red cells to white cells in the peripheral blood may not be an accurate indicator of the effects of blood contamination on CSF fluid (Wilson and Stevens 1977) . Rand et al (1990) suggested a formula for the correction of CSF white blood cell counts based on the CSF red blood cell number. This study also showed that the formula was likely to overestimate the degree that blood contamination elevated CSF white cell counts in approximately 50% of cases. The maximum expected increase in white cells is calculated based on the assumption that there is one additional white cell/ml of CSF per 100 red cells/ml of CSF. In this study, cases were excluded if blood contamination was significant enough to explain the elevated white cell count. Thus, all cats with true CNS inflammation would be included but is possible that some cats with true inflammation were excluded.",

Possible causes include cell lysis, less cells entering the lumbar CSF or migration of white cells from lumbar CSF to blood (Bailey and Higgins 1985) . Increased protein concentration in the lumbar CSF may be caused by sluggish spinal CSF circulation resulting in protein accumulation. Similar differences have been observed in feline CSF protein levels (Hochwold et al 1969) . Changes in white blood cell counts between lumbar and cisternal punctures have not been compared in cats.

It has been shown that evaluation of albumin:globulin ratio (!0.5) and anti-coronavirus antibody in body cavity effusions (any titre) had a good positive predictive value for the diagnosis of FIP. In addition, the highest serum anti-coronavirus antibody titre (1:1600) also had a good positive predictive value however, any serum antibody titre less than this was not valuable (Hartmann et al 2003) .

            "text": "The next most common disease category in our study was neoplasia, with both confirmed lymphoma and undetermined forms accounting for 22.6% of the cases. In contrast, Rand et al (1994a Rand et al ( , 1994b found that 16% of cases (combined primary inflammatory and non-inflamma-tory CNS disease) were diagnosed with nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis of suspected viral origin. Quesnel et al (1997) found 47% of cats presented for seizure disorders to have nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis of possible viral cause. Our study found that only three cats had findings that were supportive of non-FIP viral infection. The diagnosis is suggested by mononuclear meningitis without visceral lesions of FIP and perivascular cuffing as the only histologic lesion (Lundgren 1992) . It has been postulated that certain viruses, eg, parvovirus, feline herpesvirus, calicivirus, FIV and FeLV could all cause these histopathological lesions. The arboviruses have received special interest in Canada. There are six strains of arbovirus known to cause encephalitis in humans in Canada (Artsob and Spencer 1979) . Some of these are also known to be endemic in the wild animal population and experimental infections in cats (Powassan virus) have caused non-suppurative meningoencephalitis (Keane et al 1987 , Rand et al 1994a . There are more than 70 strains of arbovirus in Australia, only two of which are known to cause encephalitis in humans (Murray River and Kunjiin virus) (Boughton 1994) . The cause of feline non-suppurative meningoencephalitis is not known but the apparent variation in the diagnosis of this condition may reflect differences in causative agent(s) seen in the two geographical locations.",

Interestingly, both cats with thiamine deficiency had a mild suppurative inflammation. To the author's knowledge, there are no reports in veterinary or human literature on the CSF findings with thiamine deficiency. As CSF collection is a diagnostic test, it is not required if the diagnosis is known. A diagnosis of thiamine deficiency can often be suspected from dietary history and clinical signs. Thiamine deficiency results in cerebrocortical necrosis (Read and Harrington 1986, Steel 1997) that could result in a mild suppurative CSF infiltrate.",

Neuroanatomical location provided some indication of the diagnosis in cats with lymphoma, other neoplasia, spinal cord granuloma or trauma (spinal cord). The degree of CSF inflammation, CSF protein concentration and systemic signs provided little contributory information to the final diagnosis other than in cats with FIP. Despite often extensive diagnostic evaluation, 37% of cats was left without a premortem aetiological diagnosis. Future prospective studies with thorough post mortem examination are warranted as post mortem evaluation was only performed in this retrospective study in 18 of the cases. The increased use of advanced imaging (CT/MRI), CSF antibody, molecular biological methods, and CNS biopsy may aid in the diagnosis of CNS disease in the living patient.",
