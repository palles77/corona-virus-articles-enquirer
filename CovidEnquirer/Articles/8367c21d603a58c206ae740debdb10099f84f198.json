            "text": "Background: GenBank contains over 3 million viral sequences. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. Results: We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of \"alerts\" that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBank's submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. Conclusion: VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allows researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.",

            "text": "As of September 2019, GenBank [1] contains more than 3 million viral sequences totaling over 4 billion nucleotides in length and including over 180,000 complete genomes for viruses other than influenza. More than 250,000 of these sequences were submitted in 2018. All sequence submissions are validated prior to deposition in GenBank. Automated validation and annotation methods become increasingly important as sequence submission numbers grow. Table 1 shows the number of sequences for the 16 virus species with the most sequences in GenBank. Influenza sequences are the second most abundant and the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), where GenBank is housed, has expended considerable effort to organize flu sequences and streamline the submission of new influenza virus sequences, including a tool to validate and annotate flu submissions called FLAN [2] . The influenza virus sequence submission tool (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ genome/viruses/variation/help/flu-help-center/submitflu-sequences/) is implemented specifically for influenza with many hard-coded features. It has proven [3] (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation) includes specialized components that attempt to normalize annotation of previously submitted sequences for rotaviruses, dengue virus, West Nile virus, ebolaviruses, Zika virus, and MERS coronavirus. The resulting standardized annotation supports virus-specific searches using gene and protein names. However, the Virus Variation Resource does not support submission of new sequences, and its tools are not generalizable, such that creating components for additional virus species is laborious.",

Finally, CDS features that encode proteins are validated for protein-coding potential using blastx. Submitted sequences that are confidently aligned and annotated with VADR pass and are cleared for automatic en-try into GenBank. In contrast, when a submitted sequence is evaluated by VADR and the comparison to its matching RefSeq reveals the input sequence is divergent in various ways (e.g. early stop codon, regions of low nucleotide similarity), then the sequence fails. Failure means that the sequence is flagged for manual review by an NCBI expert curator, called a \"GenBank indexer\", and the sequence is prevented from automatic entry into GenBank. If all sequences in a submission pass, all sequences will automatically be deposited into GenBank. If at least one sequence fails, a report with sequence-specific errors is generated and reported to the submitter or reviewed by the indexer, who can clear sequences for submission or contact the submitter for further investigation of the apparent problems.",

The script first retrieves a FASTA-formatted sequence file and five-column feature table files for the RefSeq and any protein sequences associated with CDS features of the RefSeq from NCBI. v-build.pl parses these files and outputs a VADR \"model information\" file with coordinates of CDS, mat peptide, gene, ncRNA and stem loop features and product and exception qualifiers. By default, all other feature types and qualifiers are ignored, although command-line options can be used to specify that additional features and qualifiers should be included. v-build.pl also outputs a covariance model (CM) file for the input RefSeq created using Infernal v1.1.3's cmbuild program. If the RefSeq nucleotide sequence being modeled has known secondary structural elements, such as stem loops, then a Stockholm format file with structure annotation can be provided, and the resulting CM file will model the specified structure. This structure will inform the sequence-and-structure based alignment of input sequences by Infernal's cmalign program in the annotation stage of v-annotate.pl. By default, if no Stockholm file is input to v-build.pl, then the RefSeq sequence is modeled without secondary structure. Additionally, v-build.pl uses the makeblastdb program from BLAST v2.9.0+ [7] to create a BLAST database from amino acid translations of the RefSeq CDS features. vannotate.pl uses this database with blastx to validate its nucleotide-based predictions of CDS features. This design in which VADR annotates nucleotide sequences, but validates with protein alignments allows us to mitigate the known difficulty that the 20-letter amino acid alphabet is more sensitive in homology searching than the 4-letter nucleic acid alphabet [8] , while retaining the capability to annotate ncRNAs and other features that are not translated.",

The window boundaries reported at this stage of the filter pipeline are inexact but this imprecision is irrelevant for the classification stage's goal of identifing the model that scores highest for each input sequence. The window boundaries are more precisely defined at later stages. In practice, if the input sequence is actually a single viral genome sequence or partial genome sequence, as expected, then the window reported at this stage will often be the entire sequence.

During intermediate phases of testing, we recorded in detail the fate of every submitted sequence into six categories. Among 922 norovirus sequences submitted in 2019 during this phase, 898 (97%) were accepted automatically, 8 were accepted by an indexer without changes, 8 were accepted by an indexer after making changes, and 8 were sent back to the submitter. Among 1702 dengue virus sequences submitted in 2019, 1602 (94%) were accepted automatically, 6 were accepted by an indexer without changes, 83 were accepted by an indexer after making changes, 8 were sent back to the submitter, and 3 had a more complicated fate. After VADR was put into full production usage for norovirus, the record-keeping was reduced to record only how many sequences are evaluated by VADR and how many sequences pass or fail. Among 3143 norovirus sequences evaluated by VADR in production mode, 2809 (89%) passed while 334 (11%) failed. If these data are representative of norovirus and dengue virus submissions, the expected reduction in the number of sequences that need to be manually reviewed by NCBI indexers (which prior to development of VADR was 100%) will be about 10-fold for norovirus submissions and about 15-fold for dengue virus submissions.",

To separate the likely complete genomes, we used the empirical cumulative distribution functions of how many sequences returned by the above queries have each length, x, and are (not) annotated as \"complete genome\". The selected thresholds were > 7380nt and > 10, 371nt for norovirus and dengue virus, respectively because almost all sequences labeled \"complete genome\" exceed these lengths. However, there were 5 norovirus and 27 dengue virus sequences shorter than these threshold lengths returned by the above Entrez queries that are annotated \"complete genome\". Therefore, we revised the queries partitioning each sets of lengths into two disjoint intervals by using the \"[slen]\" attribute.

This alert does not indicate a unique problem itself, but rather is reported for mature peptides for which the parent CDS that is cleaved to form the mature peptide has a fatal alert, so it is redundant with at least one other alert. The next most common alert, noannotn, occurs for 2753 sequences, 2236 of which are in the DP dataset, indicating that no similar RefSeq was found for these sequences during the classification stage. Other alerts with more than 1000 instances include indf5pst and indf3pst which occur when the blastx protein-based alignment of a predicted CDS translation in the validation stage does not extend to with 5 nucleotides of the 5' or 3' ends of the nucleotide-based alignment. Thirty additional fatal alerts occur for at least one sequence. Four fatal alert types do not occur for any sequence: unexdivg would be reported in the rare case that a sequence was recognized as similar to a RefSeq but too divergent to align within memory requirements; lowsimis would be reported if a dissimilar region occured outside all predicted features, which is unlikely for norovirus and dengue virus which have features nearly along their full length; indfstrp would be reported if blastx reported similarity to a CDS region on the negative strand, when nucleotide similarity is primarily recognized on the positive strand, and incsbgrp would be reported if a sequence is recognized as not belonging to a specified subgroup (e.g. Norovirus genotype), but is never reported because we did not specify subgroups in our tests. This alert was added to fit the design of the NCBI submission interface for norovirus in which submitters are asked to specify the genogroup, and it is triggered only when VADR judges that the sequence belongs to a different genogroup. Showing that VADR catches problems not caught before is not sufficient to prove that VADR is necessary to check virus submissions to GenBank. There might be an existing software package that could be used for this purpose instead. Via literature search, we judged that two packages VAPiD [16] and VIGOR [17, 18] might be candidate alternative packages to check at least some submissions. Therefore, we compared the performance of VAPiD and VIGOR to VADR on randomly chosen sequences from the sets described above. From each of the four sets of sequences we randomly selected 200 to create four datasets of 200 sequences each for testing, with the condition that any sequence with 10 or more consecutive Ns, or with more than 50% ambiguous nucleotides was rejected from our sets of 200 because those sequences are flagged for manual review by NCBI indexers upon submission, outside the operation of VADR.",

Larger libraries are more likely to contain mistakes or anomalies that should not be mapped onto incoming sequences that may be automaticlly deposited in GenBank. An example is the sequence FJ446720.1 from the NC dataset, which is in the VAPiD reference library but lacks annotation of the VP1 CDS. Both VADR and VIGOR fail this sequence due to a premature stop in the putative VP1 CDS, but it passes VA-PiD because its reference sequence (itself) lacks VP1 annotation and so the VP1 region is not examined for premature stops. This sequence may be biologically valid, but should be reviewed by GenBank indexers as opposed to being automatically deposited into Gen-Bank. On the other hand, a larger reference database can contain more diversity than a smaller one, and the most common VADR failure in the NC dataset is due to an early stop codon in the nonstructural polyprotein CDS by three nucleotides (11 of the 16 cdsstopn alerts in the set of 35 sequences mentioned above). This failure may have been avoided with a larger reference database that included a norovirus sequence with this three nucleotide shorter CDS variant (an example is AB933745.1). We plan to add to VADR's reference library as we find areas of sequence space that it does not adequately cover. We also plan to extend VADR to use profiles built from multiple alignments instead of single sequences which should enhance its ability to analyze and annotate some sequences that are divergent from available RefSeqs.",

At NCBI, sequence submissions have been checked by indexers since NCBI began operating GenBank, but over the years, limitations to this arrangment have become apparent. First, the number and size of sequence submissions has grown much faster than the NCBI budget and the capability to hire more indexers. Second, although GenBank indexers are trained rigorously and homogeneously and use the same software, there is no formal mechanism to enforce \"inter-observer agreement\", meaning that all GenBank indexers would be guaranteed to give the same evaluation of the same submission. Third, researchers who wish to submit their sequences cannot reproduce all the checks that GenBank indexers do. Consequently, problematic sequences cause delays and e-mail interactions between submitters and indexers that might be avoidable using a more deterministic and open system of checks. The importance of transparency in curatorial analysis was emphasized by Walter Goad, one of the founders of GenBank: \"It is important that we be perceived by the molecular biology community as offering free and open access to the information and programs we will be collecting\" [20] .",

In this work, the four dengue virus RefSeqs were updated to include annotation of a subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) and associated stem loop structures, that are relevant in pathogenicity and evasion of the host immune system in at least some flaviviruses [5, 28, 29] . Incoming dengue virus sequence submissions will now include these RNA annotations because of VADR, which employs covariance models of both the conserved sequence and secondary structure of the RNA elements. VADR can also handle ribosomal slippage and that capability will become evident when it begins to be used for Hepacivirus, West Nile virus, or ebolaviruses. VADR's full sequence alignment-based annotation strategy enables annotation of any feature that has nucleotide positional information in the Ref-Seq annotation. This includes discontiguous features, including multi-segment genes and features as short as a single nucleotide.",

Users may construct VADR models for any viral species represented by a RefSeq or other GenBank sequence, but it is important to make sure that all the features for the sequence are properly annotated with the current nomenclature. Users may write to info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov either to inquire as to which viral RefSeqs have been vetted to the standards needed in VADR and required by GenBank indexers, or to suggest corrections or request updates to RefSeq annotations.",

Valid sequences that are sufficiently dissimilar from all RefSeq-based models will fail because alerts designed to identify dissimilar sequences will be reported. The failures of some sequences from the test datasets that pass VAPiD and/or VIGOR can be attributed to this, as discussed in the Results section. During testing with incoming norovirus sequence submissions, three additional RefSeqs, included in the nine norovirus RefSeqs used for the tests described herein, were created to address this issue. Stimulated by some recent norovirus submissions with sequences dissimilar from the nine RefSeqs in the VADR 1.0 library and by a newly published norovirus genotyping paradigm [30] that suggested additional candidate RefSeqs more similar to the new sequences, we selected and curated 11 additional norovirus RefSeqs to reach a total of 20. The additional 11 RefSeqs are being used internally when VADR results on a norovirus submission with the initial set of nine RefSeqs yields certain alerts associated with low sequence similarity. VADR can be run on such sequences with 20 models for norovirus instead of nine models. Whichever ones of the additional 11 norovirus RefSeqs prove useful in internal testing will have their models included in a future version of VADR and be used in automated processing of submissions.",

Profilebased methods are more sensitive at homology detection [31, 32, 33, 34] then single sequence based methods and so this strategy may improve performance. Extending VADR to profiles was envisioned from its design inception and the cmbuild program which creates VADR's CM files can take as input a multiple alignment. All sequences in the alignment the profile is constructed from should include the same set of features with start and end points aligned, which will limit the phylogenetic breadth of some alignments. For example, among noroviruses, eight of the nine RefSeqs encode three proteins, but murine norovirus (represented by NC 08311) encodes four proteins. A similar problem arises among different subtypes of West Nile virus that may or may not encode WARF4 [35] .",

For models without secondary structure it could be reasonably argued that VADR should use profile HMMs instead of CMs for the alignment stage, because HMMs are more efficient to compute with than CMs and in the absence of secondary structure are essentially equivalent models. However, we opted to always use CMs for the alignment stage because the popular HMM package HM-MER3 is not well-suited to accurately defining alignment endpoints, as it is restricted to local alignment only, whereas Infernal allows global alignment with respect to the sequence, and consequently can identify at least some boundaries more accurately.",

VADR implements rigorously documented operational semantics for characterizing sequence problems and other unexpected characteristics, which should simplify the interaction between sequence submitters and GenBank indexers when submitted sequences fail.
