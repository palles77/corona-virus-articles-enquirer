Any significant change in the environment may serve as a precursor to an infectious disease outbreak. In other cases, an infectious disease outbreak can overwhelm the surge capacity of the health care system and allow the disease to spread throughout a community. Whether a disease spreads and how quickly it spreads depends on several factors-the pre-existing levels of disease, the demographics of a population (eg, age, immune status), the density of the living conditions, the quality of sanitation and hygiene, and access to basic and preventive health services.",
