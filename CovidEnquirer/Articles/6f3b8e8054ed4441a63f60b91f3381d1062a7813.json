Although there is no known cure for Ebola virus, there is some evidence that the severity of the disease can be curtailed using plasma from survivors. Although there is a general consensus on the importance of research, methodological and ethical challenges for conducting research in an emergency situation have been identified. Performing clinical trials is important, especially for health conditions that are of public health significance (including rare epidemics) to develop new therapies as well as to test the efficacy and effectiveness of new interventions. However, routine clinical trial procedures can be difficult to apply in emergency public health crises hence require a consideration of alternative approaches on how therapies in these situations are tested and brought to the market. This paper examines some of the ethical issues that arise when conducting clinical trials during a highly dangerous pathogen outbreak, with a special focus on the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. The issues presented here come from a review of a protocol that was submitted to the Global Emerging Pathogens Treatment Consortium (GET). In reviewing the proposal, which was about conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using convalescent plasma in the management of Ebola virus disease, the authors deliberated on various issues, which were documented as minutes and later used as a basis for this paper. The experiences and reflections shared by the authors, who came from different regions and disciplines across Africa, present wide-ranging perspectives on the conduct of clinical trials during a dangerous disease outbreak in a resource-poor setting.",

There are ethical concerns around patient recruitment and the collection of plasma from EVD patients who have just recently recovered from a seriously debilitating infection; the storage, use and sharing of samples and data; the non-inclusion of pregnant women and children; the prioritization of access to therapy; appropriate study design within the context of the compassionate use of convalescent plasma for therapy; and post-trial access issues among others Hayden, 2014; Folayan et al., 2014a) . The GET is an African-led consortium with international collaborations aimed at harmonizing the response to the outbreak through the belief systems of the community in which it has the greatest effect. The consortium includes expertise from several fields that are necessary to contain this type of outbreak. It has a governing hierarchy that oversees several working groups (Newswire) . Its Ethics, Community Engagement and Patient Advocacy and Support Working Group (ECEPAS) reviewed research protocols prior to submission for institutional ethics approval. This paper highlights those ethical discussions and how determinations were reached to ensure ethical integrity in the design and implementation of a protocol that sought to evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ebola Virus Disease Convalescent Plasma for Treatment of EVD (hereafter referred to as target study). The protocol took into consideration, the contexts of the localities where trials would be implemented, and the validity of the research methodology.",

According to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Tri Council Policy Statement Canadian-TCPS 2) panel on research ethics, emergency health crises tend to be time-limited and require authorities to exercise special responsibilities and powers to deal with the situation (Canadian TCPS, 2015) .",

In this condition, patient management involves confinement and restricted movement and contact with patients to reduce transmission of the virus through direct physical contact (Lowe et al., 2015; Southall and MacDonald, 2014; Yamin et al., 2015) . The emergency crisis caused by the epidemic necessitates the need to conduct research for drugs and vaccines that can cure and or prevent EVD infection. Unfortunately, the situation on the ground makes the conduct of research during the epidemic ethically challenging. For example, affected persons have unattended personal, physical and emotional needs, the health system is severely constrained with lack of effective treatment, making individuals infected with EVD lack access to acceptable standards of care (Nusbaum, 2015; Wiwanitkit et al., 2015) . These conditions increase the vulnerability of individuals in the affected region as they are exposed to more fragile negotiations; with volunteers likely to enroll in research as a sole means to obtain medical care (Amey, 1982; Richardson, 2005; Morrison et al., 2009) . Similarly, EVD patients in West Africa may experience desperation for any form of life-saving therapies, irrespective of its known efficacy level. The fragile psychological status of affected individuals may limit their ability to make informed choices about participation in EVD research or clinical trials that offer some hope of EVD remedy. Their ability to make an informed decision about the potential for immediate or lifelong adverse effects of their participation may be severely diminished or impaired (Morrison et al., 2009; Burke, 2014; Schmidt et al., 2004) .",

Candidate products, including preventive and therapeutic interventions, must continue undergoing rigorous clinical trials to determine their efficacy and effectiveness and their ability to prevent hazards to the community in line with the precautionary principle (Adebamowo et al., 2014; Gonzalvo-Cirac et al., 2013) . The need to test these therapeutic and preventive candidate products is based on the need to generate robust evidence on the safety and efficacy of products before being used widely (Gonzalvo-Cirac et al., 2013) . Public health crisis situations may thus call for flexibility in the rigor with which therapies are tested and brought to the market. Supporting this view; in her article on the ethics of clinical science in a public health emergency, Sarah Edwards contends that conducting clinical research under the usual regulatory constraints may be difficult or even impossible during a public health emergency (Edwards, 2013) . She further argues that, \"despite the fears associated with conducting research in an emergency situation, there has been little effort to consider the process by which scientifically robust data can be ethically gathered in such situations\" (Edwards, 2013, see page 3 ). An important question linked to this concern is: how can new interventions for treating dangerous pathogens be tested and evaluated ethically?",

            "text": "Despite the general consensus on the importance of conducting research during epidemics (Morrison et al., 2009) , opinions are divided as to what framework should be used when conducting such research. Some authors have underscored the importance of a robust review of the protocol by competent and independent Ethical Review Boards (ERB), and suggested the need for the ERB to grant a waiver of informed consent under certain circumstances. (Petrini, 2013; Hill et al., 2011; Lemaire, 2007; Triner et al., 2007) . Others have argued that the tightly controlled, rigorously staged, and cautiously distributed process by which therapies are normally evaluated is not appropriate in pandemic situations (Vaslef et al., 2006; Kipnis et al., 2006) as responses to sudden public health emergencies need to be both effective and extremely prompt, and the time required to implement most research protocols in the most rigorous manner is often not compatible with the timeline required to respond to an emergency situation and bring diseases under control (Petrini, 2013) . To this end, Sarah Edwards proposed a different methodological approach of using cluster randomized control trials in which both the therapy's safety and efficacy are simultaneously studied within a population by randomly allocating the intervention under investigation to groups of people rather than randomly selected individuals (Edwards, 2013) . Similarly, Cohen et al. proposed the use of a stepped-wedge cluster as an alternative to using a randomized control trial design for the development of Ebola virus vaccines (Cohen and Kupferschmidt, 2014) to overcome the ethical dilemmas associated with the continued compassionate use of experimental drugs that have been shown to be safe for use in phase I studies (Joffe, 2014; Hantel and Olopade, 2015) . In this design, a new investigational vaccine or other treatment would be introduced to selected groups at a chosen time with those waiting for the treatment acting as control groups. As more of the drug is manufactured, groups acting temporarily as control groups could be included in the study (Edwards, 2013) . The phase III Ebola \u00e7a Suffit trial which tested a recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine expressing a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV) and whose results, released on 31 July 2015; showed 100% effectiveness, was based on an adapted stepped-wedge cluster design (Henao-Restrepo et al., 2015) .",

However, the efficacy and appropriate dosage of convalescent plasma for the management of Ebola virus infection in humans remain unknown, although some extrapolations were made from Mupapa et al. (Mupapa et al., 1999) to suggest that a dose as low as 200 ml of plasma from convalescent Ebola virus donors may have been effective in curtailing the severity of the infection. More recent preliminary data on the compassionate use of convalescent plasma suggests that similar doses have been used, but there is limited data on the quantity of specific anti-EBOV immunoglobulins that were infused. There are thus many unanswered questions that justify the need to design a clinical trial about the use of convalescent blood for managing Ebola virus infections.",

These Ebola Virus antibodies (EBOV) are likely to be complex and to be made of several immunoglobulin G isotypes with multiple functionalities. In principle, the plasma collected from a survivor would contain these antibodies, which may provide a similar beneficial virus-neutralizing effect in the recipient as the effect observed in the donor. The plasma can be collected in one of two ways. First, it can be collected either as a single donation of approximately 400e450 mL of whole blood from the survivor, from which approximately 200e250 mL of plasma is separated from blood cells (red and white cells, and platelets) by centrifugation. Second, it can be collected through a procedure called plasmapheresis, in which the donor is connected through intravenous access to an apheresis machine that is programmed to extract only plasma (typically 500e600 mL) without affecting the blood cell components that are returned to the donor. This plasmapheresis approach allows for a larger collection of plasma over more regular periods because it does not interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the red cells, which is inevitably a limiting factor in blood component donation (Burnouf et al., 2014) .",

Therefore, the working group discussed how to conduct clinical trials in which the experimental therapy was the limiting reagent and had also been used as salvage clinical therapy. Discussions about the research design at various levels ensued. There was a consensus that it was unethical to withhold a treatment option that had relatively strong potential for clinical utility. Given the long history of using plasma therapy for other infections with no harm, the study was seen as conforming to the principle of non-maleficence. This decision resulted in the first design to apply deferential doses to two clinical trial arms. The realization that CEP would be in short supply to support such a study led to further modifications, resulting in a study design in which patients who were infected with Ebola virus and who were willing to be transfused and monitored under experimental conditions served as the study intervention arm. The control arm would consist of patients infected with Ebola virus who did not have access to convalescent blood because of the non-availability of matched plasma. Patients in the control arm would receive standard therapy for Ebola virus infection, and those in the intervention arm would receive convalescent plasma along with standard therapy.",

Therefore, learning about the use of a potentially effective therapy for their management was important. Second, pregnant women are not generally excluded from being recipients of plasma transfusions. Their exclusion in this case therefore had no scientific rationale.

This decision was made in view of the current food crisis in many parts of the countries affected by Ebola virus and the associated food shortages (Centre UNN, 2014) , the challenges EVD survivors face in getting access to income that results from stigma and discrimination (Davtyan et al., 2014; Tambo et al., 2014) , and the challenges that result from the extensive loss of personal property that is destroyed following a diagnosis of Ebola virus.",

Monetary compensation for plasma is common worldwide, including West African countries. However, in the context of research, the transactional exchange of blood or plasma would create the potential for undue inducement and influence, which is the same concern as in exchanging plasma for food packages. It was therefore necessary to explore a reasonable and acceptable mechanism, without deviating too much from the norm. One alternative was to come up with a reasonable compensation for plasma donation because many EVD survivors were already selling their plasma to generate income in places such as Liberia (Folayan et al., 2014b) . Although the Consortium does not promote plasma donation for monetary gain, it was believed that compensation of this nature would have limited negative social impacts on the EVD survivors as well as give them the opportunity to use their compensation to access other basic needs. Several arguments were leveled against providing monetary compensation for plasma donation. First, given the current poor financial status of a large number of EVD survivors, any form of monetary compensation had the potential to cause undue inducement. This compensation may also increase the risk of trial disruption because donors can organize, form cartels and then negotiate for increases in the financial incentive for plasma donation. The complex nature of this issue indicated that it was essential to strike a reasonable balance that would ensure survivors were adequately compensated yet not unduly induced to compromise their decision-making autonomy. Similar delicate balances have also been discussed by Njue et al. (2014) , Njue et al. (2015) .",

Monetary reimbursement for transport and lost wages was appropriate.

The need for therapy for the management of EVD, the history of CEP use for Ebola virus therapy and the limited understanding of the efficacy of CEP in EVD management were identified as issues that had to be addressed during community dialogues. The high potential for therapeutic misconception and the low research literacy level of the trial host communities were the reasons for holding community dialogues. It was important that research team members should not unduly raise hope and optimism about the efficacy of CEP for EVD management, and they should continue to reinforce information on the experimental nature of the trial during public discussion and communication to prevent therapeutic misconceptions.

There are multiple ethical guidelines about human study participation in trials, and thus, handling the ethical discussions on study participants for the target study was not as tricky as handling the ethical discussion on EVD survivors as blood donors for the trial.

Although the working group identified the need for rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of convalescent plasma for managing Ebola virus infections, the study design also accommodated the continued use of convalescent plasma for clinical therapy. The flexibility of the study design therefore addressed the concerns of ethicists and scientists who were divided over the compassionate use of therapy for patients while promoting the rigorous evaluation of these therapies. Lessons from the design of the study on the efficacy of convalescent plasma could also help to inform ongoing debates about design studies that rigorously evaluate the efficacy of therapies without preventing the compassionate use of such therapies. Notably, the issues raised by members of the ECEPAS working group mirrored those raised during a meeting that was organized by the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum in South Africa in November, 2014, which identified some important ethical aspects about EDV clinical trials, such as how to motivate donors without undue inducement, how to use the precautionary principle to recruit participants and how to address vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, the elderly, and children. Importantly, we noted the need to strike a balance between research participation and causing social harm by ensuring that plasma donation volunteers do not suffer any forms of social harm that may in turn discourage them from participating in the study.",

The ethical debate that ensued during the design of this study highlights some of the contentions between science, ethics and social responsibilities. Many studies that are conducted in resource-limited settings must often address the expenditure of research funds to address healthcare and social needs beyond the immediate trials. Researchers often have to decide which forms of care access are statutorily expected of their research which are good practices and morally praiseworthy (Folayan et al., 2011) . There are currently no international or regional guidelines on the standard of care for biomedical research that can help with the decision making on this issue. This ethical debate highlighted the need to avoid conflicts of interest while providing access to ancillary care programs and conducting clinical trials. Community dialogues and debates can help research teams reach a consensus on appropriate compensation. For the target study, although the Consortium would like to promote the social care of EVD survivors, we felt it was essential to consider issues bordering on conflicts of interest. Therefore, to avoid coercion, the investigators could not be directly engaged in providing life-saving social services for the same group of persons who would need to supply study intervention products.",

Second, there is little known about the transmission of Ebola virus infections through breast milk. Third, there is little known about EVD transmission from mother to child during pregnancy and/or the impact of EVD infections in pregnant women on the health of the fetus and the life-course of the child.

This scientific dilemma also comes with ethical dilemmas. Extensive consultation and dialogue can help resolve these ethical dilemmas, and existing experiences from multiple fields in public health can be of assistance. For the EVD outbreak, lessons garnered from experiences with the management of HIV, other neglected tropical diseases such as polio and malaria and other hemorrhagic diseases, and the management of infectious disease outbreaks such as influenza have helped to shape this ethical discussion. We have also come to learn that although we pursue knowledge generated from scientific endeavors, the social context of the lives of people engaged in this research would and should shape the way the research is conducted. Bioethical discussions help us to ensure that scientific endeavors are sensitive to the social and cultural contexts of the lives of those affected by the infections we investigate.
