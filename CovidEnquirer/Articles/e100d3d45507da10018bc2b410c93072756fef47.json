            "text": "Newly emerging human viruses such as Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and HIV likely originate within an extant population of viruses in nonhuman hosts and acquire the ability to infect and cause disease in humans. Although several mechanisms preventing viral infection of particular hosts have been described, the mechanisms and constraints on viral host expansion are ill defined. We describe here mycobacteriophage Patience, a newly isolated phage recovered using Mycobacterium smegmatis mc 2 155 as a host. Patience has genomic features distinct from its M. smegmatis host, including a much lower GC content (50.3% versus 67.4%) and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in M. smegmatis. Nonetheless, it propagates well in M. smegmatis, and we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to show expression of over 75% of the predicted proteins, to identify new genes, to refine the genome annotation, and to estimate protein abundance. We propose that Patience evolved primarily among lower-GC hosts and that the disparities between its genomic profile and that of M. smegmatis presented only a minimal barrier to host expansion. Rapid adaptions to its new host include recent acquisition of higher-GC genes, expression of out-of-frame proteins within predicted genes, and codon selection among highly expressed genes toward the translational apparatus of its new host. IMPORTANCE The mycobacteriophage Patience genome has a notably lower GC content (50.3%) than its Mycobacterium smegmatis host (67.4%) and has markedly different codon usage biases. The viral genome has an abundance of codons that are rare in the host and are decoded by wobble tRNA pairing, although the phage grows well and expression of most of the genes is detected by mass spectrometry. Patience thus has the genomic profile of a virus that evolved primarily in one type of host genetic landscape (moderate-GC bacteria) but has found its way into a distinctly different high-GC environment. Although Patience genes are ill matched to the host expression apparatus, this is of little functional consequence and has not evidently imposed a barrier to migration across the microbial landscape. Interestingly, comparison of expression levels and codon usage profiles reveals evidence of codon selection as the genome evolves and adapts to its new environment.",

The genome diversity and percent GC range of the mycobacteriophages support a model for phage genome evolution in which phages migrate much more rapidly across a diverse bacterial landscape than their genomes ameliorate toward that of any one host (4) . Thus, mycobacteriophages at the lower end of the percent GC spectrum are predicted to have infected lower-GC hosts in their recent evolutionary pasts (4) . We note that there are other phage-host systems with mismatched GC contents, such as T4 and the right arm of phage lambda (35.3% and 44.4%, respectively), relative to their Escherichia coli host (50.8%).",

The rationale for carriage of these is unclear, and there is no obvious correlation between tRNA content and percent GC that might reflect tRNA acquisition to augment gene expression in newly acquired hosts. It has been noted that there is no close correlation between the tRNA specificities encoded by D29 and infrequently used codons (9) or between Bxz1 and phage codon preferences of putative highexpression genes (10) . Analysis of the codon usage of 32 mycobacteriophage genomes showed that there is variation in codon usage preferences (11) .

Of the predicted 109 Patience protein-coding genes, 61% are \"orphams\" with no close mycobacteriophage relatives in the Phamerator_285 database, and most of the 48 genes with homologues in other mycobacteriophages are most closely related to those in clusters H, R, and D, which also have below-average GC contents. However, Patience has a distinctly different codon usage profile from both its host and other mycobacteriophages and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in the host. Proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry provides evidence for expression of at least 83 Patience proteins, two of which are from cryptic open reading frames (ORFs) embedded within annotated genes. We propose that Patience is a relatively recent visitor to the Mycobacterium neighborhood, having evolved primarily in lower-GC hosts within the Actinomycetales, and is in the process of adapting to growth in its new high-GC genetic environment.",

Mycobacteriophage Patience was isolated by direct plating of an environmental sample taken from near the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), Durban, South Africa, using M. smegmatis mc 2 155 as a host (3) . Isolation and purification of Patience were components of a 2-week workshop on mycobacterial genetics offered in July 2009; the genome was sequenced at the University of Pittsburgh and annotated in a second 2-week workshop at UKZN in July 2011. Patience forms normal-size hazy (~1-mm-diameter) plaques on M. smegmatis mc 2 155 at 37\u00b0C under standard conditions, although we have been unsuccessful in recovering stable lysogens. It can easily be propagated on solid media to titers greater than 10 10 PFU/ml. The genome is 70,506 bp long, circularly permuted, and presumably terminally redundant. For linear presentation, coordinate 1 is designated the beginning of an open reading frame upstream of the large terminase subunit consistent with the organization of the cluster H phages that contain homologues of the first open reading frame at their left ends (7) . The GenBank submission (JN412589) has been reported previously (3) . Genome annotation identified 109 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and one tRNA gene (Table 1) ; one additional ORF was annotated using mass spectrometry analysis (see below).",

The major tail subunit may migrate slower than its predicted mass, as observed in some other phages (37) . Numbers at right are molecular masses in kilodaltons. Table 1 ]). These all have homologues in a variety of mycobacteriophages as well as in phages of Gordonia and Corynebacterium. One (gene 103) encodes a MazG-like protein, a putative nucleoside triphosphate pyro-phosphohydrolase that is common in a variety of phage genomes (20) . Patience has a single tRNA gene, and the tRNA is predicted to be charged with glutamine and has the anticodon 5=-UUG [i.e., tRNA Gln (UUG)].

Genes are shown as colored boxes, with colors reflecting pham assignments for each gene (gene members of a phamily have the same color). Genes shown in white are orphams and have no mycobacteriophage relatives with greater than 32.5% amino acid identity or a BLASTP E value lower than 10 \u03ea50 .

Using stringent criteria for peptide identification, we identified 79 of the 109 previously annotated predicted gene products (82 different gene products, including previously unannotated genes) present in at least one of the samples, including 34 of the 35 putative virion structure and assembly proteins (genes 5 to 39), 27 of which are particle associated (Fig. 5) . Although gp9 was not detected, particle-associated peptides corresponding to a previously unannotated 37-codon gene between genes 8 and 9 were identified, which we designate gene 111 (Fig. 5) . Particles contain four additional products, gp1, gp4, gp79, and gp86, although gp86 is abundant in lytic growth and the few particle-associated peptides could be contaminants in the phage preparation (Table S1 ). The capsid subunit (gp23) appears to be proteolytically cleaved between residues 82 and 83 to generate a 35.3-kDa mature protein product; that and the gp31 major tail subunit (30.5 kDa) and gp15 (32 kDa) likely correspond to the three major species observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) . It is noteworthy that-with the exception of 31-residue gp9 -all of the genes corresponding to insertions within the otherwise canonically syntenic virion structure and assembly operon are present in Patience particles, although only 3 spectra of gp21 were identified and could represent contaminants from the lysate (Fig. 5 ; Table S1).",

For 16 proteins, the peptide coverage is insufficient to be informative about start site usage. Interestingly, seven proteins, all of them particle associated (gp1, gp20, gp21, gp26, gp31, gp37, and gp79), are acetylated at their N terminus (following methionine loss), although the functional significance-if any-is not known. Six are acetylated at an N-terminal threonine following methionine removal (the seventh is a serine acetylation), although not all proteins with N-terminal threonine residues are acetylated. gp21 is unusual in that the N-terminal-most peptides start at residue 35 of the annotated product following a glycine in the \u03ea1 position, indicating that they were not generated either by tryptic digestion or by translation initiation. Other processes such as posttranslational processing or intron splicing prior to translation may be involved. We also note that gp24 is present in the particles but that the peptide coverage (62 total spectra) is restricted to the N-terminal 50% of the protein, whereas in infected cells, the spectra reflect 100% coverage of the protein (149 total spectra). This could be explained by assembly-associated protein processing. Surprisingly, we identified several peptides corresponding to translation of regions wholly embedded within annotated genes. Two of these were identified only with peptides for which we have lower confidence and will not be considered further. The evidence supporting translation of the other two is, however, quite strong. The first of these is a 372-bp open reading frame transcribed on the same strand, in a different reading frame, within gene 91, the DNA polymerase III catalytic subunit (see Fig. S1A and S2A in the supplemental material). A total of 17 instances of seven different peptides were identified, and the spectra and fragmentation tables strongly support the peptide assignments (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). Moreover, 10 peptides correspond to the extreme N terminus with the methionine present, and there is a strong ribosome binding site upstream (Fig. S2) . Although the protein is seemingly expressed, the functional relevance is unclear. The predicted product has no close database relatives, and the evidence for conservation is ambiguous (Fig. S1A ). Barnyard contains a similar open reading frame within its polymerase, and the products share 30% amino acid identity, whereas the corresponding segments of the polymerases share only 53% identity. This region of the polymerase is more distantly related in Konstantine (40% identity), and the second open reading frame is not conserved (Fig. S1A) .",

            "text": "Although codon usage shows that Patience spent a significant portion of its evolutionary past in hosts with moderate GC contents, it is not clear what its current host range is. If Patience currently exploits more GC-rich hosts, then it would experience not only mutational biases, which would increase its GC content, but selective pressure on its most highly expressed genes to use tRNA pools poised to translate GC-rich genes. This selective pressure would be reflected in a preferred usage of GC-rich codons within highly expressed genes. Patience does experience codon selection, which is shown by the robust positive correlation between codon selection (adapative codon enrichment [ACE z ] [25] ) (see Materials and Methods) and level of gene expression, using total numbers of peptides as identified by mass spectrometry under stringent conditions as a surrogate for expression (Fig. 6B) . Codon selection is measured using \u2426 values, or the ratio of codon frequencies in genes experiencing codon selection normalized to their frequencies in genes lacking codon selection. Preferred codons are those with \u2426 values greater than 1, indicating more frequent use in genes experiencing codon selection, frequently those expressed to greater levels. Patience favors the use of GCrich codons in genes experiencing codon selection (Table 2) , with 24 of 33 preferred codons bearing GC base pairs in their third positions, whereas 21 of 26 nonpreferred codons end with AT base pairs. Moreover, the patterns of codon preference in Patience (which codons are preferred and which are not) are strongly correlated with that of M. smegmatis (Fig. 6C) , suggesting that this host imposes codon selection congruent with that currently being experienced by Patience. In contrast, Patience codon selection is not congruent with that imposed by hosts with more moderate GC content, such as Escherichia coli (Fig. 6C, inset) , although such surveys can never be conclusive.",

Growth in high-GC bacteria may have required multiple events, including acquisition of part of a tail gene (gene 47) by lateral gene transfer. Nonetheless, the mismatch between viral and host genomic profiles does not appear to have been a substantial impediment to host range expan-sion, although the highly expressed viral genes are under codon selection for more efficient translation by the host apparatus. Interestingly, although Patience conceivably could have responded by acquisition of a tRNA repertoire to facilitate phage gene expression, this has not occurred; the only phage-carried tRNA is tRNA-Gln (UUG), and CAA is not a rare codon in the Patience genome (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material).",

The approach is highly informative, providing strong evidence that many of the annotated reading frames are expressed-including 29 that are shorter than 120 codons-and providing support for many of the translational start sites, as well as revisions of start sites of several genes. Moreover, a previously unannotated gene was identified (gene 111) containing only 37 codons, and the revision of start codons indicates that two pairs of genes have significant overlaps (\u03fe60 bp). Phage genome annotation is generally more error-prone than that of other genomes because of the abundance of small open reading frames and relatively small gene size (average mycobacteriophage gene length is 640 bp). HPLC-MS/MS adds confidence to genome annotation, especially for phages such as Patience, whose coding potential does not closely match its bacterial host. It is surprising to find that at least two reading frames embedded out of frame within annotated genes are also expressed. These ORFs are generally not conserved and may not express functional products, but an intriguing possibility is that this expression is a consequence of movement into higher-GC hosts, presenting a small reservoir of new products available for selection and further adaption at little evolutionary cost. We note that ribosomal profiling of phage suggests that previously unannotated genes are expressed from its genome (26) .",

            "text": "The recent evolutionary history of Patience supports a model in which the diversity of viruses of a given host is a function of rapid movement from one host to another coupled with a landscape of diverse but closely related hosts in which the viruses evolve (4) . The large collection of mycobacteriophages that infect the common host M. smegmatis mc 2 155 encompasses considerable diversity of sequence and GC content, and it seems likely that other groups of phages have entered the high-GC environment relatively recently, with Patience representing an extreme example. We note that there are bacterial strains within the order Actinomycetales, such as those of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Corynebacterium ulcerans, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which have moderate GC contents (52.5%, 53.4%, and 53.5%, respectively) and may be relatives of hosts that supported Patience growth in its earlier evolutionary history. Their codon usage profiles (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material) more closely reflect those of the lower-GC mycobacteriophages such as Patience. Patience may share gene content with phages of such hosts, but to date, few have been characterized, other than some prophages such as phage Beta of C. diphtheriae (27, 28) . Deeper exploration into the phages of these hosts and other hosts is thus likely to be highly informative and provide insights into viral origins and viral evolution (29) .",

First, a codon usage table was generated from 20% of the genome using the genes with the most extreme value of codon usage bias as determined by 2 (where expected codon usage is calculated from the nucleotide composition). Next, adaptive codon enrichment (ACE u ) values (25) are calculated for all genes as described previously (25) , using this table to represent codon frequencies under codon selection (f o ) and the frequencies of codons among all genes in the Patience genome to represent codon frequencies expected from mutational processes alone (f N (34) , and Phamerator (35) .",

Phage particles were allowed to adsorb for 15 min, and then 4.5 ml of fresh 7H9 medium was added to the culture and incubated with shaking for 3 h at 37\u00b0C; the OD 600 was monitored throughout to follow cell growth and lysis. At 30 min and 150 min postadsorption, a 1-ml aliquot was removed from the culture, the cells were pelleted via centrifugation (1 min, 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge), and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was frozen at \u03ea80\u00b0C and then shipped overnight on wet ice to the University of California, Davis Proteomics Core (UCDPC) (http://proteomics.ucdavis.edu). There, the cells were lysed via a MagNA Lyser, the insoluble fraction was removed, and the soluble proteins were precipitated, digested with trypsin, and cleaned up using a MacroSpin column. The peptides were then separated using an Easy-LC II high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system and loaded into a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer with a Proxeon nanospray source (Thermo) for tandem MS analysis. Detected spectra and fragmentation profiles were matched against a database comprised of a six-frame translation of the Patience genome, the annotated proteins of M. smegmatis mc 2 155, and UniProt using X!

The \"Relaxed\" settings (as reported in Table S1 in the supplemental material) used a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% and a protein FDR of 5%; the \"Stringent\" settings used a peptide FDR of 0.1% and a protein FDR of 0.6%. Estimation of relative protein abundance was determined by normalizing the total number of spectra detected to the gene size.",

Fourteen additional Sanger sequencing runs using primers on genomic DNA were used to resolve weak areas. The genome assembled as a circle, and coordinate 1 was designated based on similarity to cluster H phages.

Those genes with the highest ACE u values were used to construct another codon table; this process was repeated 50 times, reducing the size of the table to 5,000 codons total. Codon selection was measured as \u2426 values (25), where \u2426 \u03ed f o /f N for each codon.
