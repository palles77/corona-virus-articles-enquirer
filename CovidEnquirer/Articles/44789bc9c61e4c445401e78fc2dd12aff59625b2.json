In March of that year, as SARS spread beyond Chinese borders, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert. 2 The SARS epidemic served as a timeous practical reminder to both China and the world that emerging infectious diseases could significantly threaten national and global safety and security.",

In 2004, a case of laboratory-acquired SARS infection was reported, and a number of containment failures occurred in high-security laboratories in Singapore, Taiwan, and mainland China. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The 2004 SARS outbreak in North China resulted from a series of flaws in the biosafety protocol at a national institute in Beijing, 5 resulting in infection of four laboratory workers. This has been the most serious biosafety event to date. 5, 6 In recent years, reports of outbreaks of African swine fever along the Chinese-Russian border fueled growing concerns that this livestock infection could spread to China. In 2018, these fears were realized, and within a very short time African swine fever had spread to many Chinese provinces. 8 Given the large scale of China's pork sector, the economic impact of such a disease has the potential to be economically devastating. 9 Recently, international political authorities and scientific organizations have both recognized the significance of and need for improved biosafety and biosecurity. The United Nations Secretary-General's Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons has been proposed as the foundation on which to build a protocol to gauge the potential for biothreats and bioweapons, and a network of designated laboratories focused on supporting such investigations is under development. 10 National legislation regarding biosecurity has been discussed and implemented in several countries. [11] [12] [13] [14] In 2016, the Chinese government incorporated biosecurity as a specific national security domain. Similarly, in 2018, the United States (U.S.) issued the new National Biodefense Strategy, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) issued the Biological Security Strategy.",
