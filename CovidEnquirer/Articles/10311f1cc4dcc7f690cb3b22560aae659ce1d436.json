Oral mucosal ulcerations secondary to infectious agents such as Candida albicans, CMV, or HSV cause inflammation and pain during swallowing or after eating, which may lead to reduced oral intake.

Patterns of lipodystrophy vary from peripheral fat wasting, or lipoatrophy, in the face, extremities, and buttocks to central fat accumulation, or lipohypertrophy, in the abdomen, dorsocervical spine regions (buffalo hump), and breasts. Both conditions may occur alone or in combination [42, 43] and can be difficult to assess in a growing child or adolescent, since changes in body fat occur normally during childhood and puberty [44] . Lipodystrophy in children with HIV is clinically evaluated by examination or self-report and has been documented to be as high as 32% [45] .",

Enteral supplementation with gastrostomy feeding has improved nutrition in a number of chronic childhood illnesses by providing adequate energy intake to promote weight gain when oral intake is poor. Miller et al. [37] first investigated the effects of gastrostomy tube feeding on weight gain, height, body composition, immune parameters, morbidity, and mortality in 1995 on 26 children with HIV. Weight Z-scores before therapy were -1.6 and had decreased to -2.2 on initiation of nasogastric feedings. Gastrostomy tube feedings significantly improved weight Z-scores to get back to baseline approximately 5 months after initiation of feeding. Significant predictors of response to gastrostomy tube feedings included higher CD4 counts at initiation and lower weight-for-height Z-scores at baseline. These findings suggested that early intervention during acute weight loss offers the best chances of improving weight in children with HIV. Children with the greatest improvement in weight after gastrostomy tube placement spent less time in hospital and had a greater likelihood of survival compared with children who did not gain weight [37] . This small but important study demonstrated that early nutritional intervention improved quality of life and reduced morbidity in children with HIV at a time when effective cART was unavailable. In the cART era, compliance with medical therapy is often improved with more reliable delivery of ARVs through the gastrostomy tube and is associated with improved CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, virologic suppression, and improved longitudinal growth.",

Weight gain tends to be associated with increase in body fat rather than muscle. Clarick et al. investigated the effects of megestrol acetate treatment on weight gain and linear growth in 19 children with HIV who had growth failure. The average duration of the study was 7 months. The study concluded that megestrol acetate was associated with weight gain but not linear growth during the treatment period. After the megestrol acetate treatment was discontinued, poor weight gain and weight loss were again noted [39] . Given the dramatic reductions in morbidity and mortality and the improved longitudinal growth in children with HIV in the United States since the widespread implementation of effective cART, megestrol acetate and other therapeutic agents (including growth hormone and the anabolic steroid oxandrolone) are prescribed very rarely, if at all, to subjects with HIV.",

Over time, in the United States, with the introduction of ARVs, the clinical manifestations associated with HIV infection as well as its treatment were seen to increase, driven by the short-and long-term toxicities of these new formulations in combination. In children with HIV, these manifestations reflected metabolic changes; wasting and stunting from gastrointestinal dysfunction were most often described in the 1980s, but new clinical concerns in the early 2000s were related to altered body composition, lipid abnormalities, and abnormal regulation of glucose metabolism. These complications were often attributed to the first-generation NRTIs and PIs. The longterm cardiovascular risks of these ARVs on subjects with HIV are still unknown. After 2007, newer PIs and integrase inhibitors became more widely available and appear to have fewer metabolic adverse effects, although ongoing surveillance of these ARVs and tenofovir will be important to evaluate incidences of renal tubular dysfunction and BMD.",

These principles include ongoing comprehensive nutritional assessments and follow-up. When cART providing effective viral suppression was unavailable, enteral and parenteral support was associated with improved weight and body composition and overall survival and is still a key part of care for children and adolescents who present with advanced HIV disease. In addition, periodic vitamin A supplementation in children with HIV who are older than 6 months of age is supported by clinical trials in Africa. Children with HIV should also receive zinc supplements in the management of diarrhea and severe acute malnutrition in the same way as uninfected children with the same conditions. Investigators should continue to study the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents, lipidlowering medications, and lifestyle changes on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia at this time when obesity has become endemic in many communities in the United States. This unfortunate development on long-term health also has implications for children and adolescents with HIV across the United States.",

To quote directly, \"Compassionate, comprehensive, and coordinated clinical care services are required for all HIV-infected infants and children through adolescence.
