            "text": "The One Health initiative is increasingly becoming a prominent discussion topic in animal and human health, with its focus on prevention of spread of zoonotic diseases, both in animals, and from animals to humans. An important part of One Health is that diagnostics and vaccines for diseases may be the same thingand be used for both humans and animals. One potential problem standing in the way of wider adoption of One Health principles, though, is that use of conventional cell fermentation systems for production of the recombinant proteins that could be used as diagnostics or vaccines is often expensive and is not easily scalable. A solution to this may be the use of plants or plant cells as bioreactors: molecular farming, or the production of biologics in plants, is now a well-established science with many proofs of principle and important proofs of efficacy for especially animal vaccines. This review discusses how molecular farming could enable important advances in One Health, using as examples plant-made vacccines, reagents and therapeutics for influenza viruses, ebolaviruses, rabies virus, bunyaviruses and flaviviruses.",

It is premised on the principle that the health of the Earth's people is connected to the health of its animals and of the environment, and encourages collaboration to achieve the best health for all of these. The initiative in its modern form dates from 2007, when a formal bond was established between the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), and when an International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in New Delhi urged governments to build One Health linkages for pandemic preparedness and human health security. Adoption of the principles by the European Union and the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, and support from international bodies such as the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health, mean that while it is still a virtual initiative that does not provide funding, its influence on national and international health policies is significant. 1 The importance of the approach can be seen when one realizes that 6 out of every 10 infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, or spread from animals (https://www.cdc.gov/one health/), and 7 out of 10 of emerging or re-emerging infections are vector-borne or zoonotic (http://www.onehealthinitiative. com/). There is particular interest in developing low-cost reagents for point-of-care diagnostics that could also be used as vaccines for animals and possibly also for humans, as these diseases mainly affect people and animals in developing countries, meaning that resources to study them are often lacking.",

Framework III vaccines are intended for use in wild animals, to prevent transmission of disease both to domesticated animals and to humans (eg: rabies virus vaccines in oral baits, Mycobacterium bovis and Lyme disease vaccines). Anthrax and rabies are 2 good case studies for One Health. Anthraxcaused by Bacillus anthracis -is a disease of great antiquity; while the development of the live spore vaccine that is still used significantly reduced its incidence in livestock worldwide after 1937, outbreaks in domesticated animals are becoming increasingly common and outbreaks in wildlife are frequently underreported or undetected. 3 Humans are usually infected via exposure to infected livestock and to carcasses of wild animals, especially in Africa and other developing areas. There is also an increasing awareness of the potential use of B. anthracis spores as a biological weapon, which adds some urgency to the development of highly effective universal vaccines.",

Efficacy to homologous challenge has been shown in mice, ferrets and chickens; so too has efficacy to heterologous challenge with high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 in chickens. 10 While most of this work is directed toward protecting humans against potentially pandemic influenza viruses, it is often overlooked that the same vaccine candidates could be equally useful in birds and in swine: indeed, breaking the chain of recycling of influenza viruses that seems to occur in intensively farmed pigs is a prime goal of One Health. 11 Other targets for plant-made influenza vaccines include dogs 12 and potentially horses.",

These are hosts of many potentially humaninfecting viruses, including the henipaviruses Hendra and Nipah; Menangle and Tioman rubulaviruses, and Australian bat lyssavirus, which is a close relative of rabies virus. 15 Indeed, intraperitoneal immunisation of mice with purified extracts of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) expressing high concentrations of rabies virus G protein elicited comparable levels of immune response to the inactivated conventional vaccine, and complete protective immunity in mice against intracerebral lethal challenge with live rabies virus. 16 In a more recent study, sheep were protected from live virus challenge by oral immunisation with a single dose of transgenic maize kernels containing 2 mg of G protein. 17 The Canadian biotech company Medicago Inc. has also patented a rabies virus-like particle vaccine made in in plants, 18 and announced an expansion of their vaccine pipeline to include the new product. 19 It is also possible to produce effective anti-rabies monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in plants: 20 The potential of such biologics to replace the rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) of either equine or human origin that is normally used for rabies immunotherapy, and which is prohibitively expensive for developing countries, is a highly attractive prospect for future development. In a response to what is seen as a pressing health need in a rabiesendemic developing country, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa is producing a soon-to-be commercialised anti-rabies MAb called Rabivir in transgenic tobacco, which they claim is 10 times cheaper than the conventional alternative. 21 ",

[22] [23] [24] An obvious target for their control, in humans but also possibly in other primates at risk like chimpanzees and gorillas, are vaccinesand this is one area of hope after the recent West African epidemic, where accelerated licensure and testing threw up several likely candidates, but one real success in recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-ZEBOV). 25 This notwithstanding, subunit vaccines may yet be useful, for Zaire and other ebola-and marburgvirusesand investigations have been done on the vaccine potential of different viral proteins to throw up useful candidates, including as well as the obvious GP1 envelope glycoprotein, VP24, VP30, and VP40. 26 Toward this goal, several plant-made antigens have been shown to have potential. One novel approach was the expression of an Ebola immune complex (EIC) in N benthamiana, using a replicating geminivirus-derived vector. 27 The GP1 protein of Zaire ebolavirus was C-terminus fused to the heavy chain of a humanised 6D8 IgG mAb antibody, which specifically binds GP1: this was co-expressed with the 6D8 light chain and the assembled mAb::GP1 chimaera was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and protein G affinity chromatography. The mAb was functional in terms of binding C1q, and the chimaera formed a cross-linked immune complex with itself. BALB/C mice immunised subcutaneously with purified EIC produced anti-GP1 antibodies at levels similar to those elicited using a GP1 VLP vaccine. Another very recent approach was to make the ebolavirus matrix protein VP40 in plants: 28 this protein is highly multifunctional and elicits protective immunity in mice. 26, 29 Transgenic tobacco plants expressed an ER-targetted VP40 at levels of \u00bb3 mg/kg fresh weight of plant tissue. The protein was given orally or subcutaneously to BALB/C mice in 3 low-dose preparations (125 ng oral, 25 ng s/c) without adjuvants, and elicited reasonable responses. Both these proteins are candidate vaccines, and candidate low-cost reagents for ebolavirus diagnostic kits.",

In the clinical trial in West Africa, 36 trial participants were randomly assigned to each of the 2 study arms: mortality in ZMapp TM -treated participants was lower (8 of 36; 22 percent mortality) than in participants receiving standard-of-care alone (13 of 35; 37 percent mortality). While this was not statistically significant because the participant numbers were low, ZMapp TM -treated participants eliminated virus from the bloodstream faster, had more rapid resolution of symptoms and were discharged from care earlier, than untreated participants. Given this apparent success, the US Government has funded Kentucky BioProcessing to stockpile the MAbs, and Mapp is going ahead to license ZMapp TM as a therapeutic for use in subsequent Ebola disease outbreaks. 30 It should be noted that the MAbs should also be highly useful in the diagnostic arena.",

While it can also be prepared as a recombinant protein from both insect and mammalian cells, these methods are both expensive and the protein yields and quality are often not good.",

The plant-produced NP detected anti-CCHFV IgG in all positive serum samples, while all negative serum samples gave results below the cut-off value.

A spur to the deployment of human vaccines for RVFV could be the recent finding that the virus may be involved in human miscarriages in South Sudan. 38 Our laboratory is in the process of testing transiently-expressed RVFV N protein for its suitability as a diagnostic reagent, similar to the CCHFV case described above.",

While there is now a licensed quadrivalent live vaccine, 43 new concerns over the interaction of dengue and other flaviviruses and in particular Zika virus, and the possibility of reciprocal ADE between them, have prompted caution over its use. For this reason, subunit vaccines consisting of E protein DIIIsimilar to the WNV example above, and which are serotype-specific and elicit neutralising antibodies which are not involved in ADEhave been trialled in monkeys, with good efficacy shown: 44 however, as with any other protein vaccine, production will probably be expensive. A group based in Korea has accordingly explored a variety of options of producing DIII-derived vaccines in plants, including fusion of a DIII with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and production in transgenic tobacco; 45 fusing a consensus DIII, which elicits neutralising antibodies against all 4 dengue virus serotypes, to M cell-targeting peptide ligand (Co1), producing it in transgenic rice calli and showing it was targeted to the mucosal immune system in mice; 46 and modifying the recombinant immune complexes (RIC) shown to work for Zaire ebolavirus GP1 by fusing the Ebola GP1 epitope binding the 6D8 mAb to the dengue virus consensus DIII domain, and then to the mAb, and producing it transiently in tobacco. 47 The purified hybrid dengue-Ebola RIC (DERIC) bound C1q, and elicited potent virus-neutralising Abs in mice without the use of adjuvants. Another group used transplastomic tobacco to produce the 4 serotype DIII proteins to moderate yield, without testing their immunogenicity. 48 This work shows that it is possible to produce candidate dengue subunit vaccines in plants that are at least the equivalent of conventionally-produced candidates.",
