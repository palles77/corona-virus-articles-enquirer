Objectives: Evaluate the relative performance of two commercial broad range systems for the detection of viral agents in clinical respiratory tract specimens from immunocompromised children. Study design: A total of 176 patient samples were included in the analysis, representing only the first sample collected for each patient, and excluding failed reactions. Samples were de-identified and assayed in parallel using two different, broadly multiplexed PCR systems: ResPlex TM II Panel v2.0 (ResPlex), Qiagen, Hilden, Germany and FilmArray \u00ae Respiratory Panel (FilmArray), Idaho Technology Inc., Salt Lake City, UT. Method comparison was based upon pair-wise concordance of results according to patient age, viral target and number of targets detected. Results: The two systems showed an overall concordance, by patient, of 83.8% (p = 0.0001). FilmArray detected at least one target in 68.8% of samples, while ResPlex detected at least one target in 56.8%. ResPlex failed to detect 20.7% of FilmArray positives, and FilmArray failed to detect 4% of ResPlex positives. The relative performance of each system (including which system detected a higher number of positive samples) varied when stratified by target viral pathogen. Conclusions: Broadly multiplexed PCR is an effective means of detecting large numbers of clinically relevant respiratory viral pathogens.",

The rapid and sensitive detection of such agents has implications for treatment decisions, clinical care, and infection control practices. As in other areas of diagnostic virology, molecular diagnostic methods have shown promise in markedly improving diagnostic sensitivity when compared to culture or antigen detection assays. While such favorable performance characteristics have made molecular methods appealing, their introduction in the clinical laboratory has been slowed by issues related to cost and technical expertise required to perform this testing.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Thus, detection of all clinically relevant entities has required running an entire panel of tests, compounding costs, and staffing requirements. The advent of broadly multiplexed assays has sought to address some of these issues. 8, 9 Front-end multiplexed amplification (typically PCR) followed by detection is capable of identifying over 20 different targets. Thus, a single assay utilizing the sensitivity of PCR can mimic the diagnostic spectrum of culture creating the potential for increasing routine detection beyond cultivable viruses, reducing processing costs, staffing requirements, and turn-around time. This technology also offers the possibility of increased ability to detect multi-viral infection. While the clinical importance of such capabilities is presently uncertain, this may carry important prognostic or infection control related implications, particularly among immunocompromised patients, such as those studied here.",

The range of agents detected [10] [11] [12] has been expanded to include newly discovered and emerging respiratory viruses such as coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and bocavirus. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] The broadly multiplexed molecular approach studied here has the capability to detect and identify more viruses simultaneously than traditional methods (i.e. culture and DFA) and shows an increased detection rate for co-infections. 8, 9, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] In the current study, coinfections were detected in the range of 1-26%, which is similar to other investigators. Sanghavi et al. investigated both adult and pediatric patients, including organ transplants and found dual infections at 10.4% and triple at 1.3%. 25 In a 2003 study, Guittet et al. reported a range of 5-40% in hospitalized children. 26 The clinical significance of detecting more than one virus is not clear, but Calvo et al. reported multi-viral infections more frequently in hospitalized infants with respiratory tract disease (17.4%). These infections were also linked to higher fever, longer hospital stays, and more frequent use of antibiotics than single RSV infections. 27 In another study by Semper et al. co-infection with hMPV and RSV revealed a tenfold increase in the relative risk for admission into the pediatric intensive-care unit for mechanical ventilation as a result of severe bronchiolitis. 28 There is little published data beyond this on the clinical significance of multi-viral respiratory tract infection, and no work specific to the importance of detecting >2 viruses. The findings here suggest that as broadly multiplexed PCR systems become more common, a new body of literature will need to be developed to address the relevance and implications of such findings for prognosis, treatment, and infection control.",

Increased RSV detection by the FilmArray was also noted by Rand et al. compared to the xTAG RVP. 29 Adenoviruses were not typed in this study, but the reduced rate of detection by ResPlex may relate to the fact that it detects only subtypes B and E, compared to the FilmArray which detects all subtypes. It was noteworthy that the detection rate for enterovirus and rhinovirus were inversely related when the two systems were compared to each other. Furthermore, if the FilmArray and ResPlex enterovirus/rhinovirus were added together in each case, they would be approximately equal in the total number of detections (78 vs. 72, respectively). This could be the result of crossover detection related to differences in the nucleic acid sequences between the two assays. Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses show extensive genomic similarity, but yet can be very different in their phenotypic characteristics. 30 The self-contained nature of the pouch system used by the FilmArray, where sample preparation, amplification, and detection take place in a closed system markedly reduces any risk for carry-over contamination between specimens. Both the Resplex II v2.0 and the xTAG RVP require external nucleic acid extraction followed by multiplexed amplification and detection using a liquid-phase array technology. This approach may carry a risk of carry-over contamination due to both additional sample manipulation and the lack of a closed system. The difference in nucleic acid extraction prior to amplification and detection, along with other variables, such as nucleic acid sequence variations and chemistry may also contribute to the differences in test performance. 31 Specimen collection procedures can also contribute to a difference in the overall test performance for any molecular test. The use of oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, or nasopharyngeal washings showed multiplex real-time RT PCR detection rates of 54.2%, 73.3%, and 84.9%, respectively in a study by Lieberman et al. 32 Other investigators have shown similar differences with the use of different swabs and collection procedures. 33, 34 The performance of both traditional and molecular-based tests varies according to the age group studied. 35 However, generally the younger children tend to show a higher viral load than older individuals. In general, this observation may account for a more favorable performance between traditional and molecular-based testing in the younger age group. In the present study, both the Film-Array and the Resplex exhibited similar viral detection in the \u22642 years age group. However, the FilmArray outperformed the ResPlex in the 3-5 year and 6-13 year groups. The viral load may have been lower in the >2 years group, accounting for the overall increase in sensitivity for the FilmArray.",

            "text": "The material costs for most molecular testing are greater than for DFA and culture, but the overall benefit may depend upon the protocol involved and could result in an overall cost reduction as described by Mahony et al. 36 The other aspect of the cost analysis is the actual labor time involved for the FilmArray and ResPlex. In the current study, the hands-on-time for the ResPlex was approximately 1 h with a total time of 4 h for testing 24 samples. The FilmArray involved only 5 min for handson-time with a total time of 1 h/sample. Based on the one cartridge per machine design of the FilmArray instrument, the throughput for FilmArray is integrally related to the number of machines available in a given laboratory. So while laboratories that process less than one sample per hour would be able to take advantage of apparently improved turnaround time with FilmArray, ResPlex is more accommodating of larger specimen loads. It would therefore take six FilmArray instruments to meet the 4-h turnaround time of a full Resplex run. Likewise, the apparent labor-saving benefits of the Film-Array system apply primarily to low volume settings. Although with practice, processing time might be less than the above stated 5 min per sample, total hands-on time for more than 15-20 samples might be expected to meet or exceed that of Resplex.",

Such methods combine the exquisite sensitivity of molecular amplification with a breath of targets previously attainable only through the use of culture-based techniques. These operating characteristics, together with increasingly selfcontained, automated, and easy-to-use methods, bring us closer to the mainstream adaptation of molecular diagnostic testing, no longer limited to academic centers or reference laboratory settings. The widespread use of these powerful techniques will have implications for diagnosis, treatment, infection control, and resource utilization in the healthcare setting.",
