Comparatively, various natural or plant products have shown similar or even better efficacy. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 lg/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 lg/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5. Compared to quercetin (73%), baccatin III (71%), psoralen (67%), embelin (65%), menisdaurin (64%) and azadirachtin (62%) that showed high inhibition of HBeAg synthesis, lupeol (52%), rutin (47%), b-sitosterol (43%) and hesperidin (41%) had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (\u0394G = \u00c05.2 kcal/mol). Similarly, all the docked antiviral compounds formed very stable complexes with HBV Pol (\u0394G = \u00c06.1 to \u00c09.3 kcal/mol). Taken together, our data suggest the anti-HBV potential of the tested natural compounds as novel viral Pol/RT inhibitors.",

A range of various plant metabolites are shown to impede virus replication without affecting the host physiology or with limited side-effects (Martin and Ernst, 2003; Hussain et al., 2017) . In addition to their ability to interfere directly with viral replication, these natural products may also modulate the host immune response against infection (Kurokawa et al., 2010) . In line with this, several natural or plant-derived compounds belonging to different chemical classes have been reported to have potential anti-HBV activities (Chen et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2005; Wang, 2000; Huang et al., 2008; Chou et al., 2012; Qiu and Chen, 2013; Wu, 2016; Parvez et al., 2016) . Compared to interferons or lamivudine treatment, some plant products are reported with similar or even better efficacy (Chen and Zhu, 2013; Arbab et al., 2017; Zhang et al, 2017) .

All compounds were energy minimized using Universal Force Field (UFF). The compounds showing DG ! \u00c06.0 kcal/mol were re-docked to HBV Pol to evaluate their detailed binding mechanisms using Autodock 4.2 as described elsewhere (Morris et al., 2009; Al-Yousef et al., 2017) . For molecular docking, target protein and ligands were prepared as described elsewhere (Rehman et al., 2014; Rabbani et al., 2017) . Briefly, the target model protein HBV Pol was prepared by removing any heterogeneous compounds and water molecules. Polar hydrogen atoms and Kollman charges were added to the protein using Autodock tool (ADT). Affinity grid maps were generated in such a way as to cover the complete active sites of the protein. Molecular docking was performed using Lamarkian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) to calculate the possible conformations of the ligands that bind to the target protein. Here, the ligand was set free to search and bind at the active site of the protein in the most favorable or minimum energy conformation. Initial positions and orientations of the ligands were set randomly while the torsions were set to a maximum of 6. Each run of the docking was performed to calculate 2,500,000 energy evaluations. The population size, translational step, quaternion and torsion steps were set to 150, 0.2 and 5 respectively. On the basis of binding energy (DG), best docked structures were saved and analyzed for receptor-ligand interactions using Discovery Studio 4.0 (Accelrys Software Inc., 2012). The binding constant (K b ) for protein-ligand interaction was calculated using the following relation (Rehman et al., 2016) : DG \u00bc \u00c0RTlnK b (R = gas constant, 1.987 cal/mol/K; T = temperature, 298 K).

Since the crystal structure of HBV Pol was not available, we used homology modeling to predict its three-dimensional structure. It has been reported that the amino acid residues from 347 to 698 determine the reverse transcriptase activity of HBV Pol. We therefore, used the above sequence as query to search protein database for the identification of the most suitable template. Based on the primary sequence alignment (Fig. 6A) , we used HIV-1 RT (PDB Id: 1RTD) as a template for HBV Pol homology modeling because the two viral proteins demonstrated highly conserved residues important for enzymatic activities. The homology model of HBV Pol was generated using the Swiss model server (Fig. 6B) , and validated by Ramachandran plot. The Ramachandran plot showed 75.2% of the residues occupying the favored region, while 19.0% and 3.9% residues occupied the allowed and generously allowed region, respectively. Only, 2.0% of the residues were located in the disallowed outlier region (Fig. 5C ). Overall the Ramachandran plot suggested that the generated model of HBV Pol was of reasonably good quality and therefore, used for molecular docking.",

            "text": "During the past decades, antiviral drug research technology has helped establish many efficacious anti-HBV drugs that eventually lead to emergence of drug-resistant strains. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural or plant products. Antiviral drug discovery and development passes through several stages, of which the in vitro cell culture systems and in silico molecular modeling represent first and fastest drug screening steps. Absence of a robust cell culture system for the propagation of HBV impeded the in vitro antiviral studies until the advent of HBV DNA cloning and establishment of stable cell lines. The HBV-reporter cell line, HepG2.2.15 is one of the established systems for preliminary screening of anti-HBV drugs. In the present study, the anti-HBV potential of specifically selected natural compounds was assessed by their inhibitory effects on HBsAg and HBeAg expressions in the HepG2.2.15 culture supernatants. Of these, quercetin, psoralen, baccatin III, menisdaurin, embelin and azadirachtin showed the high activities whereas lupeol, rutin, b-sitosterol and hesperidin had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. HBV Pol is the most important viral protein as potential drug-target despite emergence of drug-resistant mutations in and around the Pol/RT 'YMDD' motif (Locarnini et al., 2008) . We used homology modeling to generate a 3-D structure of HBV Pol and validated it by Ramachandran plot wherein the 'YMDD' corresponded to the Tyr203, Met204, Asp205 and Asp206 residues. To further delineate the binding mechanism of the anti-HBV active compounds and lamivudine (ligands) to the modeled HBV Pol (receptor), we performed molecular docking. Docking of lamivudine indicated that it strongly interacted with the active site of HBV Pol through bonding with Pro59, Ala181, Ser202 and Ala181, forming a stable lamivudine-Pol complex with an estimated Gibb's free energy of \u00c05.2 kcal/mol. Interestingly therein, the two Pol 'YMDD' motif residues, Tyr203 and Met204 were among the lamivudine surrounding amino acids.",

In this report we demonstrated the novel anti-HBV activity of azadirachtin. Our docking study showed interaction of azadiractin with HBV Pol through Glu1, Pro5, His156, Ser117, Arg120 and Arg153, resulting in a stable azadiractin-Pol complex with a free energy of \u00c08.1 kcal/mol.

A water-soluble derivative of hesperidin, glucosyl hesperidin has been reported to have in vitro inhibitory activities against human and avian influenza A viruses (Saha et al., 2009 ). Our present data demonstrated the novel anti-HBV potential of hesperidin. In molecular docking, hesperidin formed bonds with Glu39, Ser40, Ser85, Ser117 and His156 where the hesperidin-Pol complex had a free energy of \u00c09.3 kcal/mol.",

Of these, quercetin, baccatin III, psoralen, embelin, menisdaurin and azadirachtin showed high anti-HBV activity whereas lupeol, rutin, b-sitosterol and hesperidin had moderate effects. Moreover, a combination of querce-tin with highly active compounds enhanced the therapeutic efficacy. This was further supported by in silico molecular docking analysis where all tested anti-HBV molecules strongly interacted with the modeled HBV Pol active site residues. Taken together, our data suggested the novel anti-HBV potential of these natural compounds as viral pol/RT-inhibitors. Nonetheless, further experimental and pre-clinical studies on the most active compounds are warranted.",
