Presumptive diagnosis is based on elevated body temperature, vomiting, abdominal tenderness, drainage from the incision, inflammatory leukogram, and low glucose. Survey abdominal radiographs generally are not helpful; they are difficult to assess critically because of the presence of postoperative air and fluid. Barium should not be used because it may cause peritoneal irritation. Aqueous contrast agents are not sensitive enough to pick up small perforations. If the presence of a leak is in doubt, remember the axiom, \"It is better to have a negative exploratory laparotomy than a positive postmortem.\" ",

            "text": "Should anastomosis of small intestine be performed with 8-10 sutures? For: Several authors have suggested that intestinal anastomosis can be successfully performed with minimal sutures (i.e., 8-10). This technique is less time-consuming and causes less trauma to intestinal tissue and blood supply. Against: Patients with intestinal obstruction frequently have associated bowel pathology (e.g., inflammation, edema, vascular compromise). Eight to to sutures are likely to leave gaps of significant size that encourage leak. Sutures should be placed no further apart than 3 mm; a typical anastomosis requires 20-25 sutures.
