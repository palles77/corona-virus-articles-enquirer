A typical example is the case of display of peptides longer than 6 amino acid residues on the major coat protein, protein VIII of the filamentous bacteriophages M13 and fd. A solution to this problem has been the use of ''two-gene systems'' generating chimeric phages that concomitantly express wild-type protein VIII along with recombinant protein VIII. Although the two-gene systems are much more permissive in regard to insert length and composition, some cases can still adversely affect phage assembly. Although these phages genotypically contain the desired DNA of the insert, they appear to be phenotypically wild type. To avoid false-negative results when using chimeric phages in binding studies, it is necessary to confirm that the observed lack of phage recognition is not due to faulty assembly and display of the intended insert. Here we describe a strategy for generating antibodies that specifically recognize recombinant protein VIII regardless of the nature of its foreign insert. These antibodies can be used as a general monitor of the display of recombinant protein VIII into phage particles.",

            "text": "Filamentous bacteriophages have proven to be an extremely useful tool for the study of protein-protein interactions [1,2] and have had a profound impact on the analysis of antibody-peptide binding [3] [4] [5] . Of the five structural proteins that make up filamentous phages, proteins III and VIII are most often used as N-terminal fusion proteins, displaying their foreign inserts on the phage surface [6] . Protein III most easily displays inserts and can express proteins hundreds of amino acids in length without a negative impact on assembly or titer of phages. Thus, protein III is routinely used in antibody phage display where either Fab or single-chain antibodies are expressed [7, 8] . Although this system is quite efficient and widely used, the number of antibody or insert copies is limited to the five copies of protein III per phage. In situations where higher insert density is desirable, protein VIII should be considered. This is due to the fact that the filament structure is composed of some 2700 copies of protein VIII, a short 50-aminoacid protein that associates with the phage single-stranded DNA at its carboxy terminus and displays its free N terminus on the surface of the phage [6]. Peptide inserts can be introduced at the Nterminal aspect of protein VIII without disrupting the assembly so long as they are kept shorter than 6 to 8 residues [9,10]. Expression of longer peptides on all copies of protein VIII interferes with proper phage assembly. Thus, for instance, Cesareni and coworkers reported that only 20% of phage clones inserted with random octapeptides and 1% of clones inserted with random decapeptides pro-duce viable phage particles [9] . Longer inserts can be displayed employing a ''two-gene system'' where two versions of protein VIII are expressed in the infected bacterium, one corresponding to unaltered wild-type protein VIII and the other being a recombinant that can display peptides even longer than 100 amino acids in its N-terminal aspect [11] . In this situation, assembly of the phage generates chimeric phages containing mostly wild-type protein VIII studded here and there with recombinant versions displaying their peptide insert at the phage surface [12] . Moreover, such chimeric phages may contain recombinant protein VIII displaying large inserts at extremely low levels [11, 13] . To complicate matters, it has been shown that not only the length but also the sequence of the insert can affect incorporation levels into phage particles by affecting the critical steps of protein VIII membrane insertion and processing [13] .",

            "text": "The fth1 ''88'' phage display vector contains two copies of protein VIII genes, one wild type and the other recombinant ( Fig. 1 ; see Ref. [12] ). Peptide display is based on insertion of foreign sequences into the recombinant copy of the protein VIII gene between two SfiI sites separated by a DNA sequence coding for two stop codons followed by a trpA transcription terminator, all of which displace the reading frame by 1 nucleotide [12] (Fig. 1) . Hence, prior to insertion of a foreign sequence between the two SfiI sites, no recombinant protein VIII is produced and the phages display only wild-type protein VIII. Due to the presence of the SfiI insertion cassette, recombinant protein VIIIs contain a discriminating sequence not found in wild-type proteins (Fig. 1) . In view of this, it was proposed that the N-terminal 7 residues of recombinant protein VIII (AEGGQRG), which contain the first SfiI-encoded unique sequence (GQRG), could serve as a universal endogenous antibody tag for all recombinant versions of the protein regardless of length or composition of the peptide being displayed. Because most of our random peptide libraries often contain flanking cysteine residues to generate constrained looped random peptides, we decided to include the first cysteine residue as amino acid 8 in the GIL to be tested (AEGGQRGC). Once designed, it was then necessary to produce fusion proteins that display the GIL to be used as immuno-gens. For this, the GIL-encoding sequences (GIL inserts) were cloned into the asymmetric AvaI site (CTCGGG) found in the modified MBP expression vector pMalC-133-AvaI (see Materials and Methods). We previously demonstrated that cloning inserts into such AvaI sites drives the formation of tandem repeats of the inserts in the proper reading frame and orientation [15] . This is due to the fact that the internal asymmetry of the restriction site generates two different 5 0 overhangs, thereby forcing compatible inserts to clone in only one orientation. Clones containing two, three, and four linear GIL insert repeats were isolated and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 2) . The clone containing three tandem repeats was selected and used for MBP-GIL fusion protein production, which in turn was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting polyclonal serum was tested for specific binding to the GIL.",

As shown in Fig. 4 , binding signals from polyclonal rabbit anti-M13 antibodies remained constant, confirming the equal total phage concentrations. In contrast, however, binding signals from both GIL-Ab and 1B6 mAb dropped in a very similar manner as the concentration of 1B6 peptide presenting phages decreased, illustrating the similar detection sensitivity of both reagents and the correlation between the presence of the 1B6 peptide and the generation of the GIL in recombinant protein VIII.

Table 1 is a list of 12 different peptide inserts validated for display on protein VIII using GIL-Ab and the relevant anti-insert antibodies. The peptides range in length from 7 to 43 residues, some of them contain flanking cysteine residues and others do not, and together they represent reasonable cover of amino acid compositions. Validation of peptide expression was carried out by phage ELISA (see Materials and Methods). Each of the phages displaying the listed peptides was tested for binding to both GIL-Ab and the anti-insert antibody listed as compared with wild-type fth1 phages. All 12 peptide displaying phages gave high binding signals to both GIL-Ab and the corresponding anti-insert antibodies, whereas only background binding was observed using the wild-type fth1 phages (data not shown). The fact that peptides not flanked by cysteine residues are recognized by GIL-Ab shows that the cysteine residue is not essential for binding. In addition, peptide 12 is also missing Gly7 of the GIL sequence. Nevertheless, GIL-Ab binds this construct efficiently. Hence, the first 6 GIL residues (AEGGQR) are the core GIL-Ab epitope, with some flexibility as to the sequence at the C terminus of the GIL. Over the past year, we have successfully used GIL-Ab as a general insert label detector for a wide variety of inserted sequences, showing GIL-Ab to be a general detector of recombinant protein VIII regardless of the nature of the displayed sequence.",

In studying the polyclonal serum response against HCV core protein, we used three recombinant phages, each expressing a different peptide on protein VIII and designated cores 1, 2, and 3 (see Materials and Methods). Sequencing confirmed that all three phages contained the expected DNA inserts in the proper reading frame. However, when tested against polyclonal serum from a patient positive for HCV (Fig. 5) , core 1 consistently gave a strong signal, core 3 gave a weaker but clearly detectable signal, and core 2 gave no response at all. The initial conclusion could be that the core 2 peptide is apparently not an efficient antigen and little activity against this epitope is detectable in the patient's serum. However, lack of activity could be explained by inappropriate peptide conformation despite its being displayed efficiently by phage protein VIII [16] [17] [18] [19] . Testing the binding of GIL-Ab to these phages is extremely revealing. Phages cores 1 and 3 gave strong GIL-Ab responses, illustrating that although the peptides are equally well expressed and assembled in the phages, the HCV serum response to each is quite different. This is not surprising because the HCV serum was derived from a patient infected with HCV subtype 1a (core 3 represents a subtype 3 peptide). Surprisingly, no GIL-Ab response could be demonstrated for the core 2 phage, whose signal was no better than that of wild-type phage. Hence, the absence of signal with the HCV serum is first and foremost due to lack of expression, assembly, and display of the core 2 peptide, and conclusions regarding immunogenicity or proper peptide conformation cannot be drawn based on this phage system. Here GIL-Ab proved to be a critical reagent-a sensor of sorts for the confirmation that recombinant protein VIII is expressed and assembled.",

Polyclonal antibodies that specifically bind the N terminus of recombinant protein VIII (GIL-Ab) were produced and shown to be capable of binding a variety of recombinant protein VIIIs displaying different peptide inserts. Thus, the use of GIL-Ab provides a single reagent that enables the monitoring of chimeric phages produced using the fth1 vector. Because phage display libraries are used extensively for diagnostic purposes and as tools for vaccine research [20] [21] [22] (reviewed in Refs. [23, 24] ), validating the presence of the displayed peptide is of utmost importance for minimizing false-negative results caused by difficult-to-display sequences.",

ELISA wells coated with anti-M13 antibodies were used to capture three different phages: chimeric phages displaying the 1B6 peptide on protein VIII while containing both recombinant and wild-type protein VIII (black); homogeneous phages displaying the 1B6 peptide on all copies of protein III while containing only wild-type protein VIII (gray); and wild-type fth1 phages (hatched). The captured phages were reacted against GIL-Ab, 1B6 mAb, and rabbit anti-M13 polyclonal antibodies. Bars represent standard deviations of duplicate measurements from a single experiment. Testing the detection threshold of GIL-Ab by ELISA. Chimeric phages displaying the 1B6 peptide on protein VIII at a concentration of 10 11 phages per milliliter were serially diluted 1:2 into wild-type fth1 phages at the same concentration. The phage dilutions were then added to ELISA well plates coated with anti-M13 antibodies. Captured phages were detected using GIL-Ab (triangles), 1B6 mAb (circles), or polyclonal rabbit anti-M13 (squares) antibodies. Bars represent standard deviations of triplicate measurements from a single experiment.",
