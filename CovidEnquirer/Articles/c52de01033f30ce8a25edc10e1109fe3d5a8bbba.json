However, little research on planning has been conducted in writing contexts, and there is no firm evidence to demonstrate that pre-task planning promotes L2 learners' written production in the ways that many researchers have reported for L2 speaking contexts. In this paper, I have explored whether and how concept mapping as a form of pre-task planning could benefit the writing performance of three Japanese ESL learners. I analysed four compositions from each of the learners, written with and without concept mapping; using measures of accuracy, complexity, fluency and [Hamp-Lyons, L., 1991. Reconstructing ''Academic writing proficiency''. In: Hamp-Lyons, L. (Ed.), Assessing second language writing in academic contexts. Ablex, Norwood, NJ, pp. 127-153.] holistic measures of global quality, communicative quality, organisation, argumentation, linguistic accuracy, and linguistic appropriacy. I also examined through a questionnaire, retrospective interview, and logs, the learners' applications of the strategy in their writing processes. Pre-task planning was associated positively with the overall measures of the learners' written production during in-class compositions, with the exception of accuracy. Moreover, each learner made unique applications of the concept mapping strategy in their writing processes, suggesting that concept mapping may help ESL learners improve their composing but in ways unique to individual experience, motivation, and task conditions.",

Following this research paradigm, a number of studies have examined the effects of planning time on L2 learners' language production and have explored the potential of pre-task planning. The underlining assumption of these studies is that pre-task planning may minimise L2 learners' cognitive expenditure for processing information during task performance by allowing them to prepare in advance for a task, and consequently enhance the quality of their language production.",

The research to date has generally reported positive effects of pre-task planning on language production, especially for fluency and complexity; however, recent findings showed controversial results where accuracy was concerned (see Ortega, 1999) . The different results from these studies, especially in accuracy, suggest that a number of factors (e.g., task type, planning condition, assessment measure, L2 proficiency) may influence the effects of planning time. Recently, Yuan and Ellis (2003) demonstrated the complex nature of pre-task planning research and pointed out the need for further investigation of various factors involved in the planning processes (see Ellis, 2003 ; for a summary of task design variables affecting learners' language production).",

Because the number of L2 pre-writing planning studies is limited, it is difficult to see common traits of planning effects on learners' writing performance by comparing the results across studies. However, what can be said from the research to date is that advance planning time itself does not seem to have much effect on L2 learners' output in writing. This is different from the research on speaking, which generally shows that learners' oral production may improve by simply allowing them time to plan before speaking. Since writing processes can involve longer time for both pre-task and while-task planning than speaking processes, the effects of extra time for pre-task planning can easily blur in the sequence of time for composing. Learners in these studies may also have revised their produced text and corrected their mistakes while writing, and thus the effects of pre-task planning on accuracy may not be evident in their writing performance. These possible characteristics of writing signalled the need for an explicit strategy in a planning phase for writing. Accordingly, the present study attempted to explore how a planning phase prior to writing might affect L2 learners' writing performance.",

            "text": "The present study adopted concept mapping as an instructional strategy and examined its potential for improving ESL (English as a Second Language) learners' written production. Concept mapping was first developed by Hanf (1971) as a model for improving the teaching of study skills. It typically starts with students generating words relevant to the topic and sorting them into groups of associated words. Students then develop their ideas on the topic and draw organisational structures, which can either be linear or hierarchical. Concept mapping is based on the principles of schema theory, which presupposes that information is stored in the brain as abstract mental structures, categorical rules, or scripts that humans use to interpret the world (Schmidt, 1999) . Therefore, instruction for concept mapping usually includes a brainstorming session where students are encouraged to activate their prior knowledge of a topic and focus on the relevant content schema (Carrell et al., 1989) . The technique of concept mapping has been widely practiced and studied under different terms, such as semantic mapping (e.g., Cronin et al., 1992; Heimlich and Pittelman, 1986; Lipson, 1995; Schultz, 1991) , cognitive mapping (e.g., Boyle, 1996; Peresich et al., 1990; Reynolds and Hart, 1990) and webbing (e.g., Brown and Salisch, 1996; Norton, 1993; Pieronek, 1994) . The distinction between these terms is not clear in the literature, and they are likely to be used as equivalent in both L1 and L2 studies.",

For example, Cronin et al. (1992) reported the progress of a district plan for secondary schools in Mississippi, demonstrating that mapping strategies had promoted students' understanding of text organisation and writing processes based on the results of writing tests over a four-year period. Reynolds and Hart (1990) provided three instructional conditions (i.e., concept mapping, brainstorming and outlining) to fourth graders and compared the efficacy of each strategy technique in the revising stage of writing.

Schultz (1991) implemented the semantic mapping strategy in a second-year French university programme in California, investigating the instructional effects on students' writing performance over a year. In the first semester, instructors introduced semantic mapping as a pre-writing activity. The process initiated from class discussion, where students generated ideas on a selected theme and made connections between the idea clusters. After the brainstorming activity, students formulated a theoretical generalisation, a thesis statement, or a group essay. At the end of the lesson, instructors addressed the benefits of the mapping strategy and encouraged students to utilise it when writing. The mapping strategy was used intermittently throughout the second-year French class. The instructors reported improvement in students' writing ability, willingness to participate in discussion, and satisfaction with their work on the course. Schultz (1991) study implies the potential of mapping strategies as an effective pre-writing activity to enhance students' writing performance. In this second-year French programme, semantic mapping was combined with group or general class discussion, in which students tried out and refined their ideas with their peers for writing. Schultz points out that the combination of mapping strategies with oral activities could promote students' ''higher-level thinking'' (p. 986), whilst developing their organisational skills for writing. Considering a variety of interpretations and applications of concept mapping in actual classroom contexts, I use the word 'concept mapping' in a broad sense in the present study. In terms of its shapes and structures, concept maps may include a description of associated word clusters with no explicit organisational structures. In terms of its application, concept mapping may be combined with other brainstorming activities such as discussion, and I consider this whole connected process as the concept mapping strategy in a form of pre-writing activity. Since the main purpose of adopting the concept mapping strategy in this study was to provide an explicit approach to planning, I accepted a loose definition of this strategy to meet a real classroom situation.",

The programme focused on paragraph writing, comprising the instruction of vocabulary, grammar and compositions. The programme session lasted for four weeks, and the class met twice a week for 140 min a day. The instructor of the course, Karen (a pseudonym), was using concept mapping as a pre-writing activity, and this initiated my approach to her writing class as a possible site for this research project. Karen provided concept mapping instruction to activate students' prior knowledge related to a topic, and preferred to apply this planning strategy with a group activity (e.g., group discussion) so that students could take new information from their peers and expand their ideas for writing. In Karen's class, concept mapping was introduced in the third week of the programme session, and was used through the last two weeks as a pre-writing activity for both in-class and homework compositions.

As Table 2 shows, Chie and Miho's scores in composition 3 were better than those in composition 1 in all rating categories, whilst Yuri's scores in those in-class compositions showed no obvious differences. The degree of differences in the in-class compositions varied among the rating categories, as well as among the learners. For example, the organisation scores of the pre-planned compositions were considerably better than those of the non-pre-planned compositions in both Chie (3.0) and Miho's (2.0) cases; however, those in the linguistic accuracy measures showed relatively small differences among the six rating categories. In the homework situations, all the learners' scores showed only minor or no differences between the preplanned and non-pre-planned compositions across the rating categories. Table 3 shows the composition ratings in the accuracy, complexity and fluency measures. As Table 4 indicates, the differences in scores between the compositions written with and without the pre-task planning activities showed distinct tendencies in the measures used in this phase of analysis. All the complexity measures, for example, showed the students' better performance in both in-class and homework compositions when they drew concept maps to plan their writing. Among the three learners, Miho performed the best in the overall complexity measures in both in-class and homework situations.

However, their ways of drawing a map involved distinct individual interpretations and features. For example, Chie seemed to employ concept mapping as a holistic brainstorming activity and drew her maps like a web, which spread by connecting a cluster of words (see Fig. 1 ). She described this strategy as an association game and jotted down the ideas that flowed out from the given topic. Miho's concept maps, on the other hand, showed a structure that represented the organisation of her completed compositions (see Figs. 2 and 3).

In order to avoid this confusion, Chie sometimes skipped drawing a concept map, especially when a writing question was provided.

Chie's comment on the usefulness of concept mapping might be perplexing, considering her interest in developing academic writing skills.

Where strategic planning does have an effect on accuracy this may be limited to rulebased grammatical features such as regular past tense. Strategic planning has a strong effect on complexity, particularly if there is sufficient time available (ten minutes) and guidance in how to plan is provided. There is also some evidence to suggest that individual learner planning or teacher-led planning is more effective than group-based planning.",

For example, the present study showed that 10 min of planning time had positive effects on the fluency and complexity but not on the accuracy of the learners' written production. This suggests that 10 min for planning was sufficient to favour the fluency as well as the complexity of written production. Considering that Chie and Miho in this study actually used their concept maps in their writing processes as they were instructed, the importance of providing guidance in planning should also be acknowledged in writing contexts. Yuri's case, however, signalled that learners may need practice to familiarise themselves with a particular planning strategy. Regarding the efficacy of individual and group planning, the results of the present study also imply that individual planning might have been more effectively applied to the learners' composing processes than group planning. The difference in efficacy between individual and group planning could be related to the nature of planning activities. Pre-task activities such as concept mapping or drafting, which can be directly connected to learners' written production at conceptual and textual levels, may function more effectively when engaged in individually. The issues discussed above, however, require further investigation because of the possible limitations of the present study, such as the lack of statistical power due to the small sample size and the possibility of extra variables involved in the task conditions in a natural classroom setting.",

Considering the findings of this study as well as those of previous planning research, it seems to be a viable option for teachers to provide learners with explicit instruction on how to make a plan rather than simply allow them extra time for planning. In this way, learners can make the most of their planning time to prepare for writing. When adopting a strategic device such as concept mapping, teachers may need to set up a training period of a certain length to familiarise their students with the specific strategy. As Yuri's case in this study has indicated, learners are likely to struggle to incorporate a new strategy into their own learning styles or practices at the first encounter. Teachers need to be aware of their students' prior experience in using the strategy and to provide appropriate support according to students' levels of familiarity with the strategy.",

Distinct functions of concept mapping were highlighted in their use of this strategy, which affected their writing processes as well as their produced texts. This indicates that teachers should not simply evaluate the learners' written production but also monitor how learners actually use a specific planning activity in their writing processes. In so doing, teachers can see the efficacy of planning activity for their students and provide them with either supplemental or alternative activities.",

Understanding these interactional effects on learners' writing performance would further clarify the effects of planning on L2 writing practices. The present study investigated the effect of concept mapping on the students' first drafting processes. The potential of concept mapping could further be explored through a longer sequence of writing practice, which may involve a role of concept mapping in feedback-revision processes.",

Considering possible benefits for L2 pedagogy, it seems crucial to further the investigation of planning effects on acquisitional levels.
