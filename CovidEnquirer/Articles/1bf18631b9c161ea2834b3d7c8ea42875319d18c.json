Total nucleic acid was extracted from swab samples using the easyMAG (bioMerieux) system and was tested for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA upstream of the envelope gene (UpE) by an RT-qPCR hydrolysis probe assay. All positive specimens were confirmed by a second RT-qPCR assay targeting the ORF1a region of the genome (3). Representative swab specimens with high MERS-CoV viral load (low CT values) were selected for full-genome sequencing. In addition, a specimen with high viral load from a study of MERS-CoV in Nigeria from which partial virus genome sequences were previously reported (1) was also selected for full-genome sequencing. Multiple reversetranscription reactions with gene-specific primers targeting different regions of the genome were used to generate MERS-CoV cDNA and were amplified using multiple PCRs with primers designed to produce overlapping DNA fragments covering the complete virus genome. These PCR products were sequenced directly using Sangersequencing methods.",

A MERS-CoV infectious cDNA clone was constructed based on an isolate of MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 provided to C.D. by R. Fouchier (Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam). It was assembled from three cDNA subclones in a BAC using a stepwise cloning strategy with rescue of infectious virus from in vitro-transcribed RNA as described in ref. 12 . Cell cultureadaptive mutations were corrected during construction of the cDNA clone so that the original MERS-CoV EMC/2012 sequence (GenBank accession no. JX869059) was recovered. To delete ORF4b, we used a two-step markerless Red recombination technique as in ref. 13 . In a first step, a kanamycinresistance gene was amplified by overhang-extension PCR from the pEP-KanS vector (kindly provided by K. Osterrieder, Freie Universitat Berlin) with primers containing homologous MERS-CoV recombination sites, the desired mutation, and an I-SceI restriction site (MERS-\u0394-ABC-Kana-F: ATTCGCGCAAAGC-GAGGAAGAGGAGCCATTCTCCAACTAATGATGTTG-TCTCCATACGGTCTTTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATCGA-TTT and MERS-\u0394-BCD-Kana-R: TTGTTTATTACCCT-GATTGGAAGACCGTATGGAGACAACATCATTAGTT-GGAGAATGGCTCCTGCCAGTGTTACAACCAATTAACC). Escherichia coli GS1783 cells (kindly provided by K.

Comparison of innate immune responses in Calu-3 cells infected with reverse-genetically engineered MERS-CoV rgEMC-WT and rgEMC\u03944b. Calu-3 cells were infected at an MOI of 2 with MERS-CoVs rgEMC-WT and rgEMC\u03944b; mock-infected cells served as negative controls (as shown in Fig. 4) . Cell lysates were collected at 6, 24, and 48 h postinfection, and mRNA expression of the IFN-inducible genes IP-10, ISG15, and MX1 and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 is shown as the mean and SEM of three biological replicates. The detection limit of each gene was 20 copies. The experiment was repeated once, and a representative experiment is shown. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's comparisons: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.",
