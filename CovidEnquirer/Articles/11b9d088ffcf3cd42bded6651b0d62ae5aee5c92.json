Building on existing research into biosecurity and the spread of infectious disease via the global airline network, this paper explores the biopolitics of public health in the UK through an in-depth empirical analysis of the representation of H1N1 in UK national and regional newspapers. We uncover new discourses relating to the significance of the airport as a site for control and the ethics of the treatment of the traveller as a potential transmitter of disease. We conclude by highlighting how the global spread of infectious diseases is grounded in particular localities associated with distinctive notions of biosecurity and the traveller.",

Drawing attention to the fact that she was speaking from Canc\u00fa n, Mexico -from where the virus was transmitted by air travel to the UK -Chan declared that: 'Recommendations to avoid travel to Mexico, or to any other country or area with confirmed cases, serve no purpose' (WHO, 2009a) .

A considerable literature exists on 'pathologies of travel', much of it historical, focusing on a number of themes including perceptions of European travellers in the colonies (Jennings, 2002; Livingstone, 1999 Livingstone, , 2002 Kennedy, 1990) , the significance of mobile bodies as a threat to the greater, Hobbesian, 'social body' (Kraut, 1995; Cresswell, 2000) and the role of certain, defined, 'others' 1 in the spread of infectious disease (Joffe, 1999; Sontag, 1991) . More recently, scholarly work has been conducted into the spread of infectious disease by air travel (Mangili and Gendreau, 2005; Tatem et al., 2006; Tatem and Hay, 2007; Budd et al., 2009) . A number of these studies, particularly in the field of epidemiology, have tested hypotheses and analysed the results for statistically significant differences. In this paper, we adopt a more qualitative approach, considering the messages broadcast by the UK print media in relation to the H1N1 pandemic. Moreover, we identify the importance of place in the context of emerging infectious disease.",

It is widely believed that the H1N1 influenza virus arrived in the UK not via London Heathrow or Gatwick (the traditional entry points for all the UK's long-haul airline traffic) but on a direct charter flight from Canc\u00fa n, Mexico to Birmingham International Airport (BIA) in the West Midlands. Whilst its spread has been well documented by 'official' bodies such as the WHO and the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA), there is scope also to focus on UK media discourses. An emphasis on messages given by national and, especially, regional newspapers, in the context of the spread of a specific emerging infectious disease, sets this investigation apart from earlier analyses of international sanitary initiatives aimed at the global traveller (Budd et al., 2009; Bashford, 2006; Zylberman, 2006) and from work on the challenges faced by UK regional airports in preventing the spread of global disease following the liberalisation of the European aviation sector (Budd et al., in preparation) .",

This period effectively covers what Chan considered to be the 'first wave' of spread (WHO, 2009a) . Our analysis commences with an overview of some existing literature on pathologies of travel, focusing on biosecurity practices in the UK and the international spread of disease. We then consider themes that emerge from the media discourse, notably the contrasting biosecurity practices being performed at airports overseas and within the UK, and their impact on the individual as a potential carrier of disease. In the discussion section, we locate our findings within existing debates on the airport as a site for the control of emerging infectious disease and on the representation of the travelling body.

Much of the rhetoric employed in this discourse has its origins in security policy research, where a distinction is drawn between the 'outside', deemed to be dangerous, and the 'inside', which is 'locked down tightly, secured and safe' (Nerlich et al., 2009, p. 2; see also, Wallis and Nerlich, 2005; Chilton, 1996) . In this perspective, rooted in Cold War literature on 'containment', a 'unitary state actor' provides the interface between the inside and outside (Chilton, 1996: 408) . The threat posed to a nation's health by global infectious disease has been 'problematized' as 'biosecurity' (Collier and Lakoff, 2008) . Problematization -often associated with the work of Foucault (Rabinow, 1984; Dillon, 2007 ) -refers to the addressing of events or situations 'not as a given but as a question' (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p. 11) . 'Biosecurity', the broad heading given to technical and political efforts to secure health, has become a prominent site of enquiry as scholars seek to understand various forms of expertise and practices through which disease threats are articulated and managed (Collier et al., 2004; Collier and Lakoff, 2008; Bingham et al., 2008) .",

Of particular interest is the increased movement of people across borders and the challenge this presents to national and regional practices of containment. The role of mass air travel in the recent worldwide spread of a number of diseases including tuberculosis, SARS and the present H1N1 influenza virus has been documented, analysed and discussed by transnational and governmental agencies (WHO, 2003b; Cooper et al., 2006; HPA, 2007) , clinical practitioners (Morens and Fauci, 2007) and academic researchers (Colizza et al., 2006; Avila et al., 2008) . At the time of the last influenza pandemic, in 1968, 261 million passengers worldwide travelled by air (ICAO, 1968) . In 2008, passenger air traffic exceeded two billion (ICAO, 2008) . Such high volumes of travel make containment more problematic. In a recent report, the WHO drew attention to the speed of spread of the current H1N1 outbreak virus:",

Other outlets, including The Times, reported on the 'enormous speed' with which flu viruses could 'mutate' into something more pathogenic, potentially developing resistance to antiviral drugs (29 April 2009). 10 The Express, a day later, described the spread of the virus across the UK. This was happening 'with frightening speed', with the UK Health Secretary 'admit[ting]' that further cases were ''inevitable'' (The Express, 30 April 2009). In this context, national newspapers were, as early as 26 April 2009, quoting expert opinion that it 'may be too late' to contain the outbreak (The Independent on Sunday). The Mirror reported that medical staff in Mexico had 'struggled to contain' the disease, resulting in fears that it could 'sweep rapidly across the globe' (27 April 2009), whilst The Times stated that public authorities 'from every corner of the world' were 'scrambling' to contain the virus (27 April 2009). The Daily Telegraph, relayed the WHO position on the futility of sovereign states issuing travel advisories, recounting that 'borders 'cannot halt swine flu'' (29 April 2009).

This led to initially complementary media reporting on a number of practices being adopted by other jurisdictions to slow or even halt the spread of disease (The Guardian, 30 April 2009). Many of the measures focussed on the airport, and included: 'reinforced checks' for visitors from affected countries (for example, by the authorities in France); provision of additional medical staff (Australia); use of thermal imaging scanners (for example, Bulgaria, Australia, Singapore, Philippines, and Indonesia); planned detention/quarantining of passengers suspected of carrying H1N1 (for example, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, China, Russia, Taiwan, and Bolivia); and powers to 'disinfect' suspected passengers (Australia) (examples extracted from: The Times, 27 April 2009; The Mirror, 28 April 2009; The Guardian, 30 April 2009).

Its measures were reported in some detail by The Times (20 July 2009) and the Daily Mail (25 July 2009). The former used largely measured language to describe the procedures in place which, although 'stringent', needed to be placed into the context of mistakes made by the country during the SARS outbreak. The Daily Mail report, on the other hand, omitted to mention SARS and employed vivid language to describe how passengers had their temperatures checked 'up to three times before reaching the immigration desks':",

In the regional press, by contrast, there was a sense of urgency; a need for the UK public authorities to do more to prevent further virus transmission. At this scale, the global processes and events outlined above were translated into locally relevant stories, and it is worth briefly considering the impact of the global political economy on localised disease management and biosecurity.",

This has placed UK regional airport biosecurity practices under greater scrutiny. An analysis of this discourse sheds light on local attempts to contain the spread of the virus. These efforts appeared to be marked by uncertainty, a lack of consistency and, in at least one case, disputes as to the best course of action. A mismatch was highlighted between regional airports increasingly hosting flights to more 'exotic' locations, and the capacity of regional cities to manage, and prevent the spread of, an infectious disease epidemic. During the early days of the H1N1 outbreak, BIA, and the Birmingham public authorities, had sought to reassure residents that they would be able to cope with such a public health emergency. Doctors and nurses at the airport had been briefed and would 'be available if anyone [was] feeling unwell' following the flight from Canc\u00fa n (Birmingham Evening Mail, 27 April 2009). Similarly, airports in other UK regional cities used the local press to reiterate to residents that preparations were in place. Examples include: Glasgow (Evening Times In reality, practices of control also varied among regional airports and were sometimes not employed at all. For example, travellers arriving in Manchester from Canc\u00fa n on 27 April 2009when the presence of the virus in the UK had yet to be confirmed -did not face any screening or questioning about H1N1 symptoms. A spokeswoman for Manchester Airport, defending this approach, was reported as stating that travellers were only being screened at Heathrow because flights landed there from Mexico City, the then centre of the outbreak (Belfast Telegraph, 27 April 2009; see also The Scotsman, 28 April 2009). At Heathrow and Gatwick airports, health officials and clinicians were reported as being more pro-active, boarding aircraft arriving from Mexico, asking passengers questions and checking them for symptoms of the disease (The Guardian, 27 April 2009; The Express, 28 April 2009; The Mirror, 28 April 2009) . The Scotsman reported that the discretionary approach adopted by UK regional airports was in line with HPA advice, with the government agency stating 'blanket screening' would not help fight the virus (28 April 2009).",

In our analysis, the airport assumes an important role as a site for the operation of various practices of control, ranging from completion of questionnaires to checking passenger body temperature using thermal imaging technology. It is a place where operations of containment were enacted and biosecurity interventions performed. In relation to press reporting, practices of control in overseas airports were frequently presented as being technologically advanced. By contrast, regional airports within the UK were represented somewhat differently. Whilst their hosting of long-haul flights opened up new opportunities for the international traveller, regional press reporting focussed on inconsistencies between airports and, more generally, reflected unease about the ability of these nodes to manage the spread of emerging infectious diseases. In this respect, by not having the technologies or the infrastructure to conduct biosecurity practice rigorously, regional airports were frequently depicted as being less advanced 'others' within the UK. We argue that greater attention needs to be paid to hitherto neglected regional discourses in this area. In their general coverage of the current H1N1 pandemic, we found regional publications to be more pro-active than the national press, urging containment measures from public authorities situated in their locality. Their approach may, in part, be explained by the commercial requirement of regional newspapers to address as great a proportion of the local population as possible, thus creating a 'community of readers' based on membership of a particular place (Aldridge, 2003, p. 498) . In this role, the regional press also serve as a disseminator of key public health messages produced both by local health authorities and by airports to give advice and reassurance to the local population.",

            "text": "Secondly, our analysis has informed a growing literature on representations of the travelling body. Central to the media reporting were ethical questions relating to the traveller and the airport. On the one hand, there was a key role played by the airport as 'censor' and a point at which the threat posed by the atrisk 'other' could be minimised. Within this context, elements of the UK press have depicted, sometimes through a nationalist lens, the stringent deployment of technologies against UK travellers, in a way that both restricted their freedom and purportedly damaged their human rights. Equally, our analysis has shown that, in certain instances, the outward traveller is expected to behave in a specific, 'responsible' way. In providing evidence of 'fitness to fly', the UK traveller was required to exercise governance over his/her body. Moreover, in electing not to travel to the countries of the South, the UK traveller would demonstrate their 'personal ethical responsibilit [y] ' to the population of the country they had planned to visit (The Observer, 2 August 2009). These representations of the 'ethical' long-haul traveller, policing themselves and showing consideration to 'others', contrasts with long-established narratives in which the Western traveller sought to safeguard their own health against contamination from the 'degenerate' environment of the global South (Kennedy, 1990; Anderson, 1996 Anderson, , 2002 Livingstone, 2002) . In this paper, therefore, our analysis of biosecurity amongst UK press reporting during the first 'wave' of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlights how the global spread of infectious diseases is grounded in particular localities associated with distinctive notions of biosecurity and the traveller.",

The Birmingham Evening Mail reported that the airport was on 'standby', with medical practitioners being 'briefed' ahead of the arrival of a Thomson flight from that resort (27 April 2009). The preparations of other cities across the UK also came under greater scrutiny as, in the words of a Bristol HPA official, 'airports and ports posed an increased risk to the spread of swine flu' (Bristol Evening Post, 28 April 2009). Indeed, other newspapers reported the cancellation of planned flights to Mexico from 'their' local airport, often quoting UK Foreign Office advice to avoid nonessential travel to that country (for example, Lancashire Telegraph, 28 April 2009; The Northern Echo, 28 April 2009; Daily Post (Liverpool), 29 April 2009).",
