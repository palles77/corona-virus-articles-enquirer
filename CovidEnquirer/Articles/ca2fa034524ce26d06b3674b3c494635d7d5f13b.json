            "text": "Mycobacteriosis in swine is a common zoonosis found in abattoirs during meat inspections, and the veterinary authority is expected to inform the producer for corrective actions when an outbreak is detected. The expected value of the number of condemned carcasses due to mycobacteriosis therefore would be a useful threshold to detect an outbreak, and the present study aims to develop such an expected value through time series modeling. The model was developed using eight years of inspection data (2003 to 2010) obtained at 2 abattoirs of the Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center, Japan. The resulting model was validated by comparing the predicted timedependent values for the subsequent 2 years with the actual data for 2 years between 2011 and 2012. For the modeling, at first, periodicities were checked using Fast Fourier Transformation, and the ensemble average profiles for weekly periodicities were calculated. An Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the residual of the ensemble average on the basis of minimum Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The sum of the ARIMA model and the weekly ensemble average was regarded as the time-dependent expected value. During 2011 and 2012, the number of whole or partial condemned carcasses exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the predicted values 20 times. All of these events were associated with the slaughtering of pigs from three producers with the highest rate of condemnation due to mycobacteriosis.",

Mycobacteriosis in swine caused by MAIC is a chronic infectious disease, which presents as caseous necrosis in submandibular lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes. In swine, the most common lesion is the one found in mesenteric lymph node [32] . Mycobacteriosis is the only known disease that forms caseous necrosis in animals and humans. Japanese meat inspection service follows the statements of a manual [20] : 'a caseous necrosis suggests mycobacteriosis', and it regards such case as mycobacteriosis without further microbiological examinations. Intestines are condemned when the caseous necrosis is a single lesion, and whole carcasses are condemned when the systemic infection is found, causing a significant economic burden for the pig producer.",

In addition to this feedback, the pig producer also receives notification when mycobacteriosis is observed. As swine mycobacteriosis occurs sporadically throughout the year, it is not easy to distinguish an outbreak from sporadic cases on the basis of either daily raw abattoir data or monthly aggregated data. Therefore, a rational framework is needed to distinguish between sporadic cases and outbreaks. However, such a framework has not been successfully developed or applied in any country.",

Moreover, such models are applied in detecting bioterrorism [23] or food poisoning of unknown source [3] by observing the excess of the case numbers over the confidence interval of expected numbers (i.e., as predicted by the model). Although time series analysis has been widely used in public health, such analysis has not been applied frequently to abattoir data. To our knowledge, such modeling is represented by 2 published studies. Neumann et al. performed a retrospective analysis of abattoir data in the New Zealand pig industry using the ARIMA model [22] . Vial et al. performed a retrospective analysis of Swiss slaughterhouse data using a GAM model [29] .",

Three main parameters need to be selected when fitting an ARIMA model: the orders of autoregressive (AR), differencing or integration (I), and moving average (MA). Autoregressive terms relate the the observation made at time t in the series to the observation made at time t-1, or to the observation made at t-2 and so on. Moving average terms relate the error (difference between observation and estimated value) at time t to the error at times t-1, t-2, etc. If the time series data contain a stochastic trend (that is, if the data contain a unit root), differencing is performed to eliminate the trend and to obtain a stationary process. The introduction of the principle of ARIMA model is described briefly by Trottier et al. [27] , and the detailed introduction to this method is available in the textbook by Brockwell et al. [6] . We examined unit roots in residual data by using the Augmented Dickey Fuller-test (ADF test) [8, 9] . These coefficients of the ARIMA model were estimated using the Arima function in R [13] by monitoring Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The estimation used data obtained between April 2003 and March 2011 and was performed under the conditions of AR (p) with 0\u2264p\u2264 5 and MA (q) with 0\u2264q\u22645. Since the ensemble average with overall mean was subtracted according to Brockwell's method, the estimation was performed without a constant term. At the same time, we compared both conditions with and without drift on the basis of the AIC.",

In order to prove the robustness of the model, we replaced the last actual condemned numbers of the training phase (de-termined by either AR or MA) with an equal number of the numbers generated randomly as follows. The numbers were drawn from a Poisson distribution with the shape parameter lambda (\u03bb) of the 8-year observed data at the training phase and were subtracted by week ensemble average. We then refitted the ARIMA model for the updated AR and MA based on the least AIC. Then, the differences in deviance between the 2 predicted models (model 1: predicted by using ensemble average-subtracted actual observed data and model 2: the last few days of the training phase were replaced with randomly generated numbers as stated above) at the valida- tion phase were tested for significance at a level of P<0.05 using chi-squared statistics.

Similar temporal patterns in the daily number of condemned intestines among the days of a week seen in both the whole dataset between 2003 and 2011, and the days which exceeded the average condemnation rate also supported the validity of this time series modeling. Traditionally, the statistical processing for abattoir data in Japan has been used only to calculate monthly and annual total incidences.

            "text": "While this study demonstrated the above-stated strengths, our analysis has three limitations. First, sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of mycobacteriosis are not taken into account. The meat inspection for mycobacteriosis in swine intestines is based on visual examination, and misdiagnosis may happen. However, restrictions in expense and time precluded our investigation of the sensitivity and the specificity of the histopathology examinations. In fact, unless molecular technology is used, classical tests would miss some infections. A study using 239 lymph nodes from pig carcasses with caseous lesions showed sensitivity of 79.1% by Ziel-Neelsen stain (189 positive) and 69.5% by culture [16] , and the kappa value (agreement) of these tests, calculated from the published data, was 0.016, which is interpreted to be slight agreement [10] . Second, a separate (though related) limitation is that the present study selected the number of condemned intestines in abattoirs due to mycobacteriosis as an objective variable. The prevalence rate among pigs slaughtered on a given day might be better variable for modeling to identify suspected outbreaks accurately, as disease is a binary response [12] . However, mycobacteriosis is a rare disease with low annual condemned rate (0.36% in fiscal year 2012), which makes the data heavily zero-inflated and over-dispersed. Third, the present model does not take background farm size into account in detecting outbreak of mycobacteriosis. There is a concern that the model may miss an outbreak of a small-scale farm, and on the other hand, it may be so sensitive against prevalence of the disease in large-scale farm that even sporadic cases may be detected.",

Specifically, the periodicity was indicated by the result of FFT without data for non-operating days, and high condemnation numbers were observed on Mondays (Table 1 , Fig. 2 ), This weekly periodicity was not caused by the periodicity in the number of swine submitted for slaughter, as no particular day-specific pattern was detected in the number of swine brought to the abattoirs (Table 1) . We hypothesize that the producers with high mycobacteriosis prevalence rates tended to bring swine to the abattoirs for slaughter on one specific day of the week (Monday). However, specific (individual) producers bringing infected swine for slaughter on Mondays in multiple weeks responsible for the increase were not able to be confirmed (data not shown), and the actual cause of the pattern remains uncertain.",
