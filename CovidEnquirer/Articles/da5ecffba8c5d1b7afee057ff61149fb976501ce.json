We then investigate a deterministic (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) SEIR compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and the intervention measures to inferred the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 and the transmission among Wenzhou and three prefecture-level cities. Finally, we forecasted and compared the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across Wenzhou (Southeastern), Shenzhen (Southern), Zhengzhou (Central) and Harbin (Northern), accounting for the effect of the Wenzhou quarantine implemented since Jan 27, 2020 and other interventions. see https://github.com/ZhangBuDiu/WZ_COVID-19 for R code, case data, and prepared datafiles.",

The median age of persons with COVID-19 was 47 years; 48 cases (11.1%) occurred in persons 65 years of age or older, and 5 (1.2%) were in children younger than 15 years of age (Table) . The maximum number of illness onset in Wenzhou appeared on January 26 (38 cases). Since January 27, the incidence per day in Wenzhou has continued to decline is likely to be due to isolation of people return to Wenzhou, implementation of region quarantine and suspension of public transportation system. Under the current control efforts, we estimate that the daily incidence by March 3-9, 2020 will drop to 0 in Wenzhou using SEIR model. The total number of affected people is 538 (95% CI: 534-542 ",
