The enzyme is a cysteine protease, with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145/His-41) in the active site. Aldehyde inhibitors can bind reversibly to the active-site sulfhydryl of SARS-CoV M pro . Previous studies using peptidic substrates and inhibitors showed that the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV M pro requires glutamine in the P1 position and a large hydrophobic residue in the P2 position. We determined four crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with pentapeptide aldehydes (Ac-EST-LQ-H, Ac-NSFSQ-H, Ac-DSFDQ-H, and Ac-NSTSQ-H). Kinetic data showed that all of these aldehydes exhibit inhibitory activity towards SARS-CoV M pro , with K i values in the lM range. Surprisingly, the X-ray structures revealed that the hydrophobic S2 pocket of the enzyme can accommodate serine and even aspartic-acid side-chains in the P2 positions of the inhibitors. Consequently, we reassessed the substrate specificity of the enzyme by testing the cleavage of 20 different tetradecapeptide substrates with varying amino-acid residues in the P2 position. The cleavage efficiency for the substrate with serine in the P2 position was 160-times lower than that for the original substrate (P2 = Leu); furthermore, the substrate with aspartic acid in the P2 position was not cleaved at all. We also determined a crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with aldehyde Cm-FF-H, which has its P1-phenylalanine residue bound to the relatively hydrophilic S1 pocket of the enzyme and yet exhibits a high inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M pro , with K i = 2.24 \u00b1 0.58 lM. These results show that the stringent substrate specificity of the SARS-CoV M pro with respect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overruled by the highly electrophilic character of the aldehyde warhead, thereby constituting a deviation from the dogma that peptidic inhibitors need to correspond to the observed cleavage specificity of the target protease.",

We have previously used this property to screen a small library of non-peptide nucleophiles (mostly amines) for molecules that would efficiently enhance the inhibition of the aldehyde by formation of a stronger binding aldehyde-nucleophile ligation product. In a second step of this process that we named ''Dynamic Ligation Screening'' (Schmidt et al., 2008) , the most efficient compound in this process had its amino group replaced by an aldehyde moiety and was reacted with the target enzyme, and the resulting covalent adduct was subsequently used to screen the same library of nucleophiles for those that would react with the aldehyde. This way, starting from a substrate-like peptide aldehyde, we obtained a low-lM non-peptidic, reversible inhibitor from two fragments which by themselves had no or only very low inhibitory activity (Schmidt et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "Interestingly, it turned out that some peptide aldehydes with an amino-acid sequence deviating from the consensus sequence embracing the cleavage sites of polyprotein substrates were surprisingly efficient as inhibitors. In particular, peptide aldehydes with P2 = Asp or Ser inhibited the main protease with a relatively low IC 50 (Al-Gharabli et al., 2006) , although it is generally agreed that the S2 specificity subsite of the enzyme has a strong preference for large hydrophobic side-chains such as Leu, Phe, or Met (Fan et al., 2004 (Fan et al., , 2005 Lai et al., 2006) . We therefore assumed that the hydrophilic P2 side-chain of these inhibitors would be oriented towards the solvent, rather than occupy the S2 pocket, and that the hydrophobic P3 residue would be binding to that pocket (Al-Gharabli et al., 2006; Schmidt et al., 2008) . This model was based on a crystal structure of a peptidyl chloromethyl ketone bound to the SARS-CoV main protease, in which this arrangement had been observed (Yang et al., 2003) . Here we show by X-ray crystallography of a number of peptide aldehyde complexes with the protein that this is not the case. Instead, the hydrophilic Ser or Asp residues in the P2 position bind to the hydrophobic S2 subsite. In order to understand these binding modes, the atomic interactions were analyzed in detail. Also, we report the inhibition kinetics of these compounds and re-evaluate the cleavage specificity of the enzyme as far as the P2 position is concerned. In addition, we determined a crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with the aldehyde Cm-FF-H (cinnamoyl-Phe-Phe-H), which has a phenylalanine residue in the P1 position and exhibits high inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M pro , with K i = 2.24 \u00b1 0.58 lM. These results show that the stringent substrate specificity of the SARS-CoV M pro with respect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overruled by the highly electrophilic character of the aldehyde warhead.",

The K m value for this substrate was determined as 24.5 lM and the apparent k cat /K m value was 2359 M \u00c01 \u00c119 s \u00c01 . However, the dissociation of the catalytically active SARS-CoV M pro dimer into inactive monomers (Fan et al., 2004) has to be taken into account. A wide range of K D values has been reported for M pro dimer dissociation (see Grum-Tokars et al. (2008) for an overview). For the enzyme with authentic chain termini, the latter authors reported a K D of 0.25 to 1.0 lM. As the M pro dimer tends to be stabilized by the presence of substrate (Cheng et al., 2010) , we used the lower limit of this range for estimation of the necessary corrections and obtained a k cat /K m value of 7863 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 . The K m value determined in our study is of the same magnitude as other values derived from data not corrected for dissociation, which are typically in the range from 10 to 50 lM (Grum-Tokars et al., 2008) . This suggests that much higher values reported previously (e.g., Verschueren et al., 2008) should probably be reconsidered.",

The crystals were all of space group C2, which is often observed for SARS-CoV M pro (Lee et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2007; Verschueren et al., 2008) . These crystals contain one SARS-CoV M pro monomer per asymmetric unit and the dimer (which is the enzymatically active species) is formed through the symmetry of the crystal. The four pentapeptide aldehydes Ac-ESTLQ-H, Ac-NSTSQ-H, Ac-DSFDQ-H, and Ac-NSFSQ-H are bound in extended conformations in the S6-S1 specificity subsites of SARS-CoV M pro . Cm-FF-H occupies sites S3-S1. Remarkably, the P1 phenylalanine side chain of this inhibitor is bound deeply in the S1 pocket, which is generally considered to be specific for glutamine. 2F o \u00c0 F c electron density maps of these aldehyde inhibitors are shown in Fig. 1 . In all complexes, continuous electron density between the aldehyde carbonyl C-atom of the inhibitor and Cys145-Sc of SARS-CoV M pro (Fig. 1) indicates the formation of a thiohemiacetal, as a result of the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine onto the C-terminal aldehyde of the inhibitor. The main-chain conformations of SARS-CoV M pro in the five complexes are basically identical, with overall root mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 0.16 \u00c0 0.36 \u00c5 for Ca atoms. In addition to the crystal soaking experiments, we also tried to cocrystallize SARS-CoV M pro with the aldehydes. The crystals obtained were predominantly of space group P2 1 , with the exception of the complex with Ac-NSFSQ-H, which still displayed space group C2. However, in most of the P2 1 crystals, no electron density for the aldehyde could be observed; thus, while the presence of the inhibitors induced a change of space group in most cases, the compounds themselves were not detected in the crystals. An exception was Ac-ESTLQ-H. The crystals of its complex with the M pro diffracted to 1.89 \u00c5, but in both enzyme monomers in the asymmetric unit, electron density could only be seen for residues P1 (Gln) and P2 (Leu) of the inhibitor (Fig. 1E and F) .

At the cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV M pro in the viral polyproteins, the P2 position is mostly found to be occupied by Leu or Phe. Accordingly, almost all inhibitors designed for the enzyme carry a large hydrophobic group in the P2 position. We were therefore very surprised to find the Ser or Asp side chains in the P2 position of the aldehydes bound to this hydrophobic site (Fig. 1) . In the SARS-CoV M pro complexes with Ac-NSTSQ-H or Ac-NSFSQ-H, there is no hydrogen-bonding interaction between the side chain of P2-Ser and residues of the S2 subsite. As the Ser side chain is small, there is no steric barrier for Ser binding in the large S2 pocket. The serine does not quite reach the ''bottom'' of the S2 pocket, but the distance between its Oc atom and the carbonyl oxygen of residue Gln192 is 4.0 \u00c5, leaving no space for a water molecule to locate in between. Accordingly, we did not find any electron density suggesting the presence of a well-ordered water in the S2 pocket, although disordered water is probably present in the pocket on both sides of the serine side-chain, where free spaces with a total volume of >70 \u00c5 3 are present between the substrate and the protein. It should be noted that the side-chain of Gln189, which contributes to one wall of the S2 pocket, is quite flexible and adopts different conformations in the various inhibitor complexes, allowing or preventing the access of water to the pocket.",

The distances (r S. . .O ) between the Sd atoms of Met49 and Met165 on the one hand and the Od2 and Od1 atoms, respectively, of P2-Asp on the other are 3.36 and 3.45 \u00c5 (Fig. 3) . Then the relative distances (d S. between the methionine sulfur atoms and main-chain carbonyl oxygens or carboxylate side-chains have been detected previously in the hydrophobic cores of proteins and were proposed to stabilize the protein fold (Pal and Chakrabarti, 2001) . It has also been suggested that S. . .O interactions should be taken into account in protein engineering studies (Iwaoka et al., 2002; Pal and Chakrabarti, 2001 ), but to the best of our knowledge, we provide here the first description of a methionine-carboxylate interaction in a protein-ligand complex.

Within the context of the peptide substrate SWTSAVXQ;SGFRKWA, all 20 proteinogenic amino acids were tested in position P2 (=X). In the HPLC-based assay, the protease concentration was kept constant at 0.5 lM. The canonical substrate with Leu in the P2 position was completely cleaved within two minutes and was therefore used as the standard to compare the proteolytic activities with other substrates. The results are listed in Fig. 4 . Our study confirmed that the most favored residues in the P2 position of the substrate (after Leu) are the hydrophobic amino acids Phe, Met, Val, and Ile. Substrates with polar amino acids in P2 are poorly cleaved. The cleavage efficiency for the substrate with P2 = Ser was 160-times lower than for the best substrate (P2 = Leu); furthermore, the peptide with P2 = Asp was not cleaved at all after incubation with SARS-CoV M pro for 16 h.",

From the substrate specificity results (Fan et al., 2004 (Fan et al., , 2005 Lai et al., 2006) , P1 has to be Gln. Moreover, in all SARS-CoV M pro complex structures described so far (Lee et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2005 Yang et al., , 2003 Yin et al., 2007) , the S1 subsite is occupied by a polar group, i.e. the side chain of Gln or a five-membered lactam (used as a glutamine surrogate). Shie et al. synthesized a series of a,b-unsaturated esters containing both P1 and P2 phenylalanine residues which showed modest inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV M pro (IC 50 = 11-39 lM) (Shie et al., 2005) . The a,b-unsaturated ethyl ester of 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamoyl-Phe-Phe was reported to be a potent inhibitor, with an inhibition constant of 0.52 lM (Shie et al., 2005) . The computer model for the complex of SARS-CoV M pro with the compound proposed that the P1 and P2 phenyl groups occupy the S2 and S3 pockets, respectively (Shie et al., 2005) . However, in the crystal structure of the complex with the aldehyde Cm-FF-H that we describe in this communication, the side chain of P1-Phe is inserted into the S1 subsite (Fig. 1G) . In order to understand this unexpected deviation from the commonly observed specificity, we compared the interaction with the S1 subsite observed in our structures of the complexes with Cm-FF-H and Ac-ESTLQ-H, the latter of which corresponds exactly to the described cleavage specificity of the M pro . The predominant S1 specificity of the enzyme for Gln is determined primarily by His163. In the complex formed with Ac-ESTLQ-H, Ne2 of His163 donates a 2.83-\u00c5 hydrogen bond to the side-chain carbonyl oxygen (Oe1) of P1-Gln (Fig. 1) . In the complex with Cm-FF-H, the side chain of Asn142 undergoes an 83.8\u00b0rotation about its v1 torsion angle compared to the conformation in the complex with Ac-ESTLQ-H (Fig. 5) , leading to an opening of the S1 subsite towards the solvent. A similar movement of Asn142 has been observed in the crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with an inhibitor called ''N1'' (PDB ID: 1WOF), where both the regular conformation of this residue and the one observed in our structure were found . The P1-benzyl group of Cm-FF-H binds to the S1 subsite by making hydrophobic interactions with Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, and the P3 cinnamoyl group of Cm-FF-H. As the S1 subsite specificity does not seem to be as stringent as previously thought. It may well be possible that other chemical groups can be accommodated here, thereby expanding the opportunities for designing and synthesizing efficient inhibitors of the SARS-CoV M pro .",

Since Asp or Ser were found to bind to the hydrophobic S2 subsite, and Phe was located in the hydrophilic S1 subsite of SARS-Cov M pro , we conclude that the stringent substrate specificity of the SARS-CoV M pro with respect to the P1 and P2 positions can be overruled by the highly electrophilic character of the aldehyde warhead. This constitutes a deviation from the dogma that peptidic protease inhibitors should comprise an amino-acid sequence corresponding to the cleavage specificity of the target enzyme. The observed nonbonded interaction of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of an aspartate residue of an inhibitor with the thioether moieties of two methionines forming part of an hydrophobic pocket of the target protein is remarkable and suggests that such S. . .O interactions should be added to the repertoire of computer-aided drug design.",
