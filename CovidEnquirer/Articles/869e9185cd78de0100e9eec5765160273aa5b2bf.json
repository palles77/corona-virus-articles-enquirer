            "text": "The ferret, Mustela putorius furo, has been domesticated for more than 2000 years. Its origin and early use are unclear, but historically it has been utilized for rabbit hunting and rodent control, particularly in the British Isles, Australia, and New Zealand. Ferrets have proven to be an important model in biomedical research, and much of what is known today about the ferret is based on this use. In recent years, its popularity as a household pet has risen dramatically because of its amicable nature, small size, and relative ease of housing and care. As the number of pet ferrets increase, so does the need for proper veterinary care. This chapter is written to familiarize the veterinarian with basic knowledge of ferret biology and care, medicine, and surgery.",

The ferret is most closely related to, and may be a descendent of, the European polecat, M. putorius, or the Steppe polecat, M. eversmanni. It should not be confused with the North American black-footed ferret, M. nigripes. The name Mustela putorius furo was derived from the Latin words putor and furonem, meaning \"stinky thief,\" and accurately describes its mischievous behavior and musky odor.",

They are very lively and active creatures, playing hard about 25% of the day and utilizing the remaining 75% for sleep. Ferrets are very curious and often investigate the smallest of spaces with ease, given their tubular-shaped, fl exible bodies. They may be vocal at times, eliciting a chirp with excitement during play, a hiss of warning when threatened, or a scream when a painful stimulus is experienced. Ferrets normally carry themselves as they walk with their torso elevated off of the ground in a slightly hunched posture. This posture is exaggerated during play, when they distinctly arch their backs, bringing their front and rear feet closer together, and move around with a characteristic bounce.",

Also quite common are the albino; the black-eyed white, with a white coat and dark irises; and the cinnamon, with beige guard hair, no mask, and a creamcolored undercoat. Silver ferrets, when young, have dark gray guard hairs, an indistinct mask, and some white present on the ventrum. As they age, the coat progressively turns to a blackeyed white variation. Varieties that have white paws are considered \"mitts,\" and those with white heads and bibs are called \"pandas.\" It has been reported that breeding silver mitts together or with black-eyed whites can produce offspring with congenital abnormalities. 1 A healthy ferret coat is shed twice a year, resulting in a long, thick winter coat and a shorter summer coat.",

The anal glands also produce a strong, pungent odor but are rarely expressed except when frightened or traumatized. The anal glands are usually removed at an early age in the United States at the breeding facility. Ferrets are unable to sweat because of a lack of sweat glands in the skin. 3, 4 Overheated ferrets often fl atten their bodies on a cool surface to dissipate body heat. Despite their musky odor, ferrets should be bathed no more than once or twice a month; otherwise, excessive drying of the skin and subsequent pruritus could result.",

            "text": "The ferret heart is cone-shaped and lies between ribs 6 and 10. From a ventrodorsal view, the apex of the heart lies to the left of midline. 2 The ligament connecting the heart to the sternum is often heavily laden with fat, giving the heart a raised radiographic appearance from the lateral view. The ferret is also unique in having a single innominate or brachiocephalic artery arising from the arch of the aorta, rather than two carotid arteries. 5 Before the brachiocephalic artery's exit from the thoracic cavity, it branches into right and left carotid arteries that continue cranially along each side of the neck to supply the structures of the head. There are differing views as to whether or not this anatomic adaptation allows for continued blood fl ow to the head even when a ferret is turned 180 degrees. 3, 5 The respiratory tract of the ferret is also unique in several ways. The trachea, bifurcating at the fi fth intercostal space, is quite long and large in diameter, characteristics that decrease the central airway and pulmonary resistance. 1 Ferrets also have a large total lung capacity and respiratory reserve compared with other animals of similar size. Even more interesting is that the airways grow in length and diameter with an increase in total body length. 1, 2 This characteristic and the similarity of the tracheobronchial wall to that of humans makes it a good comparative model for respiratory research. 1, 5 The ferret's gastrointestinal tract differs from the dog and cat in the absence of a cecum, and that the jejunum, ileum, and ileocolic junction are not grossly identifi able. 2 The small intestine is approximately 182 to 198 cm in length, and the large intestine approximately 10 cm. The short length of the intestinal tract results in a gastrointestinal transit time of 3 to 4 hours. The liver is large relative to body weight, making up 4.3% of the body weight in the ferret, as compared with the dog liver, which makes up 3.4% of the dog's body weight. 2 The ferret liver is made up of six lobes: the right lateral, the right medial, the caudate, the quadrate, the left medial, and the left lateral. The pancreas is composed of two limbs: the right, extending along the descending aspect of the duodenum, and the left, situated between the stomach and the spleen. The spleen of the ferret varies greatly in size but normally measures 5.1 cm in length, 1.8 cm in width, and 0.8 cm in thickness. 2 It is readily palpable, and when enlarged, may extend from the left cranial abdomen across the midline and down along the right ventral abdomen caudally. The kidneys of the ferret are bean-shaped, with the right kidney sitting more cranial than the left. The adrenal glands are closely associated with their respective kidneys, both of which are typically embedded in retroperitoneal fat. The left adrenal gland lies medial to the cranial pole of the left kidney, whereas the right adrenal gland may be found under the caudal border of the caudate lobe of the liver and is closely adhered to the caudal vena cava. 3 Accessory adrenal tissue has been found in some ferrets. 2 This characteristic and the anatomic location of the adrenal glands make complete adrenalectomy a diffi cult task.",

Commercial dog and cat food should be avoided, as these do not have adequate protein levels and often contain plant-based proteins. The ingestion of a diet consisting of plant proteins can result in urinary calculi (see Nutritional Disease). There are several good-quality, commercially prepared ferret diets available, such as Marshall Farms Premium Ferret Diet (Marshall Pet Products, Wolcott, NY), Totally Ferret (Performance Foods, Inc., Broomfi eld, CO), Mazuri Ferret Diet (Purina Mills, Inc., Richmond, IN, and Zupreem Premium Ferret Diet (Premium Nutritional Products, Inc., Mission, KS). Fat may be supplemented through the use of Linatone (Lambert Kay, Cranbury, NJ), a commercially available fatty acid supplement. Treats may consist of pieces of meat or meat baby food. The sick ferret can be supplemented with Prescription Diet Canine/Feline a/d (Hill's Pet Products, Topeka, KS), Nutri-Cal (EVSCO Pharmaceuticals, Buena, NJ), or Glucerna (Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, OH), which are high-calorie, high-fat nutritional supplements. (See Therapeutics for further details on nutritional supplementation for the ill patient.) Ferrets that are prone to develop gastric hairballs can be given 1 to 2 ml of a cat laxatone 2 to 3 times a week as a prophylaxis. Water should always be made readily available. This can be accomplished via a heavy bowl or a sipper bottle. Fasting of ferrets for procedures requiring sedation or blood tests may be accomplished by withholding food for 4 to 6 hours. Extended fasts should be avoided, particularly in ferrets that have been diagnosed with insulinoma, to prevent severe hypoglycemia.",

The routine exam also creates opportunities for grooming (e.g., nail trimming) and identifi cation and scheduling of necessary dental care.

As in dogs and cats, vaccination in ferrets is initiated in the presence of maternal antibodies and carried out to 14 to 16 weeks of age when maternal antibodies have waned and the ferrets' own immune system can be stimulated to develop protective antibodies. A recommended schedule for administration of the CDV vaccine is when the ferret is 6 to 8 weeks, 10 to 12 weeks, and 14 to 16 weeks of age; the rabies vaccine should be administered at the time of the last distemper vaccination. Thereafter, annual booster vaccines for CDV and rabies are recommended. The vaccines can be administered subcutaneously in the interscapular region of the body.

Disinfection involves the killing of pathogenic microorganisms through physical or chemical means. Disinfectants are those chemical agents that are used on inanimate objects such as cages or feeding utensils, whereas antiseptics are those substances that may be used on living tissue for the treatment of open wounds or surgical scrub of the skin or mucous membranes. Sterilization is the complete removal of all living microorganisms from an object, an important application for instruments used for surgery or open wounds where there is a risk of infection. Techniques and agents should be chosen based on the nature and composition of the surface to be disinfected, the level of contamination and the degree of microbial killing desired, and the effi cacy and safety of the disinfectant. 13 Sterilization should be performed on all surgical instruments through physical (moist or dry heat) or chemical (glutaraldehyde, ethylene oxide, 58% hydrogen peroxide) means. When using a disinfectant, veterinarians should always follow the manufacturer's recommendations on preparation and use to ensure effi cacy and safety. Physical cleaning of any objects intended for disinfection improves the action of the disinfectant, as the killing power of disinfectants is signifi cantly affected by the presence of organic matter. Antiseptics should be chosen based on their spectrum of action, residual effects, and tissue safety. Refer to Table 13 -1 for information on commonly used antiseptics and disinfectants.",

Use of the ketamine/xylazine combination also reduces certain hematologic parameters below baseline. The red blood cell count may be reduced by as much as 21%, hemoglobin concentration by 24%, hematocrit by 23%, and plasma protein by 15%. It has been suggested that these alterations may be due to sequestration of the blood in the spleen. Ketamine or Telazol may be used alone for restraint, but it is important to remember that these drugs may not lead to complete analgesia and muscle relaxation. 15 Both of these drugs also result in hypersalivation; therefore, the use of an anticholinergic such as atropine is benefi cial, particularly when these drugs are used as preanesthetic agents. A medetomidine/ketamine/butorphanol combination provides prolonged anesthetic periods with acceptable analgesia and may be effectively reversed with atipamizole. 14 The ideal choice for chemical immobilization in ferrets is gas inhalants. The benefi t of using gas inhalants, such as isofl urane or sevofl urane, is that they are safe enough to use in healthy or sick ferrets, and the availability of these gas inhalants in most practices makes immobilization by gas anesthesia a convenient choice. Ferrets may be masked down or induced in a clear gas chamber. When utilizing either of these inhalants, the depth of anesthesia can be quickly adjusted by altering the concentration of the inspired gas. Sevofl urane has shown to provide better systolic arterial pressures and a lower heart rate than isofl urane. 14 Additionally, isofl urane can alter hematologic parameters by decreasing the hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell count by 30% to 38%, and the plasma protein by 20% to 26%, likely by the same mechanism as the ketamine/ xylazine combination.

Careful observation of the ferret's mentation, posture, and ambulation can be done while taking a history from the owner. Healthy ferrets often exhibit curiosity for the new environment, actively resisting restraint to explore the new surroundings. Ferrets with underlying disease may present with decreased activity, lethargy, or may even be recumbent. Assessment of body condition can be done at this time as well, taking note of any fl uctuations in body weight with each visit. When this initial assessment is completed, the ferret can be minimally restrained for a basic exam. The body temperature should be taken before the start of the exam to prevent elevated recordings from increased body heat secondary to any struggle that may occur before obtaining the reading. Ferrets readily object to insertion of a rectal thermometer and restraint will be necessary. The normal body temperature range of a ferret is between 100\u00b0 F and 104\u00b0 F. 8 The eyes, ears, nose, and oral cavity should be the initial anatomic features examined on the ferret. Symmetry of these areas should be noted. The eyes should be checked for pupil size, lens clarity, corneal abnormalities, and palpebral function. Cataracts causing distinct lens opacities can occur in both young and old ferrets, and retinal degeneration may be the cause of abnormal pupillary light response. Examination of the ears often reveals a dark brown, waxy build-up within the external ear canals. This can be normal for the ferret; however, should wax build-up be in excess or the ferret is reported to be scratching at the ears, microscopic exam of an ear swab should be performed to check for the ear mite, Otodectes cynotis. In the United States, the major breeding farm of ferrets tattoo the ferrets when they have been neutered and descented. This can be seen as two blue dots that are located on the ventral aspect of the right pinna. The nose should be examined for discharge, and the owner questioned about the ferret sneezing. Scruffi ng the ferret to elicit the characteristic yawn aids in oral examination. The mucous membranes should be pink and moist with a capillary refi ll time less than 2 seconds, indicating adequate hydration. It is important to examine the tongue and palate for evidence of ulcers or structural defects. Identifi cation of the existence of any dental disease is important to the overall health of the ferret, with initiation of appropriate therapy and prophylaxis. Examination of the teeth may reveal broken canines. This is usually not a problem unless the broken teeth are dark in color or causing the ferret pain, as evidenced by anorexia or a diminished appetite. Tartar accumulation on the teeth is a common problem, particularly in ferrets that are fed a soft diet, and may be accompanied by gingivitis. Ferrets with moderate to severe tartar build-up should either have their teeth cleaned with a dental scraper or be scheduled for tartar removal with an ultrasonic scaler.",

Ferrets accumulate fat in the subcutaneous areas of the neck, axillae, and inguinal region; therefore, it is important to differentiate between fat deposits and enlarged lymph nodes. Palpation of the ferret abdomen can be done with relative ease and can yield important information about the patient's condition. The ferret should be held either with one hand under the thorax or by scruffi ng the neck while the other hand is used to palpate the abdomen. Palpation of the j-shaped stomach in the cranial abdomen should be performed carefully in ferrets presenting for anorexia or vomiting, as pain or further trauma may be elicited in animals presenting with foreign body obstruction. Sometimes the foreign body itself may be palpable as well. The spleen can be found in the left cranial abdomen. It is often enlarged, extending caudoventrally across the abdomen with the apex along the right side of the body. Enlargement of the spleen can occur in clinically healthy ferrets, but an irregular shape or masses on the spleen are considered abnormal and should be investigated further. The intestines are palpated for the presence of gas or thickened bowel loops. The mesenteric lymph nodes are also palpated for enlargement. An attempt should be made to palpate the adrenal glands lying medial to both kidneys, particularly in ferrets presenting with signs of adrenal gland disease. Normal adrenal glands typically cannot be palpated, and in obese ferrets it may be diffi cult to palpate enlarged glands because of the presence of retroperitoneal fat; however, signifi cantly enlarged adrenal glands may be detected on palpation. The bladder can be palpated in the caudal abdomen and may be painful in ferrets that have urethral obstruction and/or bladder stones. Male ferrets presenting with a distended bladder due to urethral blockage will likely require drainage of the bladder before the prostate can be assessed.

            "text": "Urinalysis is useful for identifying urinary tract disease in the ferret. Urine can be collected from a voided sample, urethral catheter, or cystocentesis. When evaluating voided or catheterized samples, bacterial contamination is a possible complicating factor to consider. Although sometimes necessary in the blocked patient, catheterization, particularly in male ferrets, can be diffi cult. Samples acquired via cystocentesis are preferred, and in obstructed ferrets, where catheterization cannot be achieved, cystocentesis is necessary for immediate relief of a signifi cantly distended bladder. With the ferret under anesthesia and positioned in lateral or dorsal recumbency, the bladder should be isolated between your index fi nger and thumb and the sample collected using a 22-to 25-gauge needle fastened to a 3-to 6-ml syringe; this is similar to the technique used for dogs and cats. Metabolism cages may also be used to collect 24-hour urine samples. Catheterization of the ferret usually requires general anesthesia. Sterile technique is recommended to prevent the iatrogenic introduction of contaminants into the urinary tract. Again, male ferrets can be diffi cult to catheterize; this is because of the acute angle at which the urethra turns at the ischial arch. The presence of a urethral stone or prostatomegaly may make the procedure impossible without causing additional trauma. Care should be taken to prevent iatrogenic perforation of the urethra when passing the catheter through this turn at the ischial arch. With the ferret placed in dorsal recumbency, the penis is extracted from the prepuce, initiating the catheterization process. Magnifi cation may be necessary to visualize the urethral opening on the ventral aspect of the penis. A needle with the bevel fi led off can be inserted into the opening to fl ush and distend the urethra with saline to facilitate the introduction of the catheter into the urethra. A water-soluble lubricant also makes passage of the catheter easier. A 20-to 22-gauge, 8-inch jugular catheter, a 3.5-Fr red rubber tube, or a 3.0-Fr Slippery Sam Tomcat urethral catheter (Cook Veterinary Products, Eight Mile Plains, Queensland, Australia) may be used. 21 The latter option is preferred based on the size and rigidity of the catheter. An intravenous catheter stylet or sterile guitar string can be used to provide rigidity to the catheter; again, the veterinarian needs to be conscious not to traumatize the urethra during the passage of the catheter. 21 Female catheterization is an easier technique. With the animal under general anesthesia, the female should be placed in ventral recumbency with the caudal body elevated. The urethral opening is located on the ventral fl oor of the vaginal vestibule, just cranial to the clitoral fossa. It may be visualized with an otoscope, endoscope, or a vaginal speculum. The catheter can be placed by sliding it along the ventral fl oor of the vagina, directed at an acute angle ventrally, until it enters the urethra. 21, 22 Catheters that are placed for therapeutic purposes can be secured by suturing butterfl y tape to the skin, and if necessary, catheters can be attached to a urine collection system. Ferrets should be closely monitored for entanglement of the tubing or disturbance of the catheter set.",

Protein is a common fi nding in ferrets, possibly due to high systolic pressure and thicker intrarenal arterial walls. 18 With this fi nding, however, the clinician should include genitourinary infection and Aleutian disease as differential diagnoses. Blood in the urine may be the result of iatrogenic trauma to the urethra during catheterization, cystitis, urethritis in males, or estrus in females. False positives for ketonuria in male ferrets have been reported with the use of urinalysis strips. The similarity in color of the dark urine produced by male ferrets and the reagent test strip is a possible explanation of the ketonuria false positive result. 17 Examination of urine sediment may reveal crystalluria in patients with blocked urethras or an accumulation of white blood cells in ferrets with urinary tract infection ( Figure 13 -2). An elevated urine pH has been associated with a diet high in plant proteins and is a good indication that diet correction may prevent crystalluria and subsequent urolithiasis.",

Due to the short GI transit times and the habit of ferrets to defecate in the same location within their cages, acquisition of a sample is not diffi cult. Often, restraint in the exam room is enough to stimulate defecation by the ferret patient. The color, quantity, and consistency of the fecal sample should be described in the record, as this may change according to the disease process present (e.g., green, mucoid diarrhea associated with green slime disease). Fecal exams for parasite identifi cation may be performed at the time of the annual exam using a direct smear and a fecal fl otation technique with sodium nitrate or a sugar solution. Further discussion of internal parasitism can be found in the section on infectious diseases. Ferrets that present with diarrhea should also have a fecal Gram stain done to evaluate ",

Radiography is advantageous in the initial identifi cation and assessment of common diseases, such as cardiac disease, splenomegaly, GI disease, urolithiasis, and prostatomegaly. Where questions may be left unanswered regarding GI disease through survey radiographs, the addition of contrast material becomes useful for the diagnosis of foreign body obstruction, bowel loop thickening, or even gastric ulceration. Ultrasonography has also proven useful in the further evaluation of certain disease processes such as cardiac disease, renal cysts, and adrenal gland disease. Because radiographic techniques require an immobile patient, sedation is usually necessary. Ferrets' long cylindric bodies can make proper positioning for radiography challenging, but extension of the forelimbs cranially alongside the head and the rear legs caudally facilitate this endeavor. They can then be secured in place with medical tape for fi lm exposure. The entire body of most ferret patients can fi t on a large cassette fi lm, reducing the number of radiographs required for many examinations. The radiographic settings preferred for all full body ferret radiographs are 50 kVp, 100 mAs, and 1/10 sec time. For contrast radiography, 4 to 6 ml of barium is the recommended oral contrast dosage. If gastric ulcers or a bowel perforation is suspected, an iodine-based contrast is recommended. Ferrets have a rapid GI transit time; therefore, fi lms should be taken every half-hour to gain a complete assessment of the GI tract.",

Infl uenza virus, another respiratory pathogen of ferrets, may be diagnosed serologically using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 24 This test detects antibodies to the virus and may be an option for rapid diagnosis. Aleutian disease, a wasting disease of ferrets caused by a parvovirus, can be diagnosed by the demonstration of antibody titers to the disease as well as a hypergammaglobulinemia through serum protein electrophoresis. 25 There are two serologic tests used to diagnose Aleutian disease in ferrets: a counterimmunoelectrophoresis, with high specifi city, and an immunofl uorescent antibody test, having increased sensitivity. 25 Counterimmunoelectrophoresis, a screening test for the same disease in mink, also has the advantage of being rapid and inexpensive.

Other common diseases that should be included as differential diagnoses for these clinical signs listed include foreign body obstruction, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and proliferative bowel disease. A CBC may identify dehydration evidenced by an increased hematocrit or regenerative anemia from blood loss due to gastric ulcers. The identifi cation of blood in the stool through a fecal occult blood test can also support a diagnosis of gastric ulceration. A positive diagnosis of this disease requires special media and culture techniques. Endoscopic biopsy may be utilized to acquire the necessary tissue sample to allow for the histologic demonstration of H. mustelae with the Warthin-Starry stain. 26 Several therapeutic regimens exist for the treatment of Helicobacter spp. gastritis that use combinations of antibiotics, mucosal protectants, proton pump inhibitors, and H 2 receptor antagonists (Table . Some of the therapeutic agents may be compounded to formulate a suspension that is not only easier to administer but more palatable through the addition of artifi cial fl avorings. Metronidazole is best compounded to a 50-mg/ml meat-fl avored suspension because of the drug's naturally bitter taste. During the initial stages of treatment, supportive care should not be overlooked. Fluids for the dehydrated patient and a highly palatable, easily digested diet such as Hill's Prescription Diet Canine/Feline a/d or Glucerna should be administered until the ferret regains its appetite. All of the listed regimens require long-term treatment of 3 to 4 weeks for complete recovery. Unfortunately, prior infection does not induce protection, and patients may become reinfected. 26",

[28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Desulfovibrio sp. is closely related to, or is the same organism as, Lawsonia intracellularis, the etiologic agent of swine proliferative enteropathy. 32 Acute signs of this disease include colitis, diarrhea with fl ecks of blood, anorexia, and weight loss. Chronically affected ferrets may exhibit chronic diarrhea, tenesmus, and rectal prolapse. Neurologic signs, such as head tilt, ataxia, or tremors, may even be present in some cases. 31, 33 On examination of a ferret with PBD, palpation of the abdomen may reveal a segmentally thickened colon and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Other causes of GI disease should be ruled out; however, a presumptive diagnosis may be made based on history, clinical signs, and physical exam. PBD can be confi rmed by histopathologic tests of tissue biopsies obtained from intestines or colon. The organism is identifi ed using the Warthin-Starry stain and appears as comma-shaped organisms located in the apical regions of intestinal epithelial cells. 28 The preferred treatment is chloramphenicol, orally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly at 50 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 to 3 weeks. 29, 31, 33 If present, a rectal prolapse typically resolves with the antibiotic treatment, rarely requiring the application of a purse-string suture.

The most helpful diagnostic approach is a cytologic examination and culture of material obtained through a tracheal or lung wash. Cytologic examination typically reveals a septic infl ammatory process characterized by degenerative neutrophils. The culture and sensitivity are important to ensure appropriate antibiotic selection.

This phase of the disease is characterized by anorexia, pyrexia, photosensitivity, and a serous nasal discharge. A fever will spike 3 to 5 days postinfection and last for several days. Also characteristic is an orangetinged rash of the chin and inguinal areas. 24, 34 As the disease progresses, the nasoocular exudate becomes mucopurulent, and a brown, crusted material accumulates around the eyes, lips, and nose. With the accumulation of this encrusted material and dehydration of the patient, the eyelids may become adhered. Hyperkeratosis of the footpads is an inconsistent clinical sign and may be diffi cult to appreciate, due to the small size of the ferret footpad. 34 Untreated cases may also develop a secondary bacterial pneumonia or other secondary disease processes. Melena may be observed early on, secondary to the stress of the disease process. Before death, the ferret's body temperature drops to a subnormal temperature. If the patient survives the catarrhal phase of CDV, a neurotropic phase will develop. 34 This phase of the disease is characterized by hyperexcitability, excess salivation, muscle tremors, convulsions, and coma.",

Ferrets may become infested with Ctenocephalides spp. the same species of fl eas that affects dogs and cats. Infestation may be acquired directly from another animal infested with fl eas or exposure to an infested environment. Affected ferrets may experience mild to intense pruritus and develop erythremic papules or alopecia over the dorsal cervical and interscapular areas. Evidence of fl eas may be noted as reddish-black \"dirt\" within the fur over the back, or fl eas may be seen in the coat or around the face. Treatment involves eliminating the fl eas on the ferret, in the environment, and on any other animals within the household. Compounds that are approved for use in cats may be used to treat fl ea-infested ferrets. Caution should be exercised when topical fl ea control is applied because toxic overdose to these small animals may occur. Organophosphates, dips, and Dichlorvos-impregnated collars should not be used because of the potential for toxicity. Frontline (Merial Limited, Duluth, GA) can be used topically as a fl ea preventative and treatment. To apply Frontline, a cloth should be sprayed and used to wipe down the ferret for treatment. Lufenuron (Program; Ciba Animal Health, Greensboro, NC), given at the cat dose, can also be used for treatment and is applied to the mid-dorsal region at the level of the shoulders. 40 The ferret ear mite, Otodectes cynotis, is also commonly diagnosed in pet ferrets. This ear mite is directly transmitted between animals. Ferrets with ear mites may be subclinical, or they may shake their head or scratch at their ears. Although mite infestations are often associated with heavy brown, waxy otic exudate, this exudate is also found in mite-free ferrets. Microscopic examination of otic exudate can be used for diagnosis, allowing for direct visualization of the mites. When a diagnosis is made, all susceptible animals within the household should be treated. Ivermectin can be administered subcutaneously at 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg every 14 days until resolution, or it can be used topically in each ear at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg divided between the two ears. 40 To facilitate topical treatment, the ears should be cleaned before treatment. Tresaderm (Merck Agvet Division, Rahway, NJ)-a topical combination of thiabendazole, dexamethasone, and neomycin-can also be used, with a recommended treatment of 7 days application, 7 days off medication, and then 7 more days of treatment. 40, 41 Ferrets are also susceptible to Sarcoptes scabiei, acquiring the mite directly from infested animals or from a contaminated environment. There are two conditions described in ferrets, both of which are characterized by intense pruritus of the affected areas. 40, 41 The fi rst is a generalized form that consists of focal to generalized alopecia that may involve the face, the pinnae, and/or the ventrum. The second clinical presentation is localized, usually involving only the paws, which often appear infl amed, swollen, and crusted. Severe infestations can result in deformity of the nails or loss of the nails or toes. Diagnosis can be made by skin scrape, although false negatives are possible. Treatment should consist of ivermectin administered at a dosage of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously every 14 days until resolution. 40 Alternatively, weekly lime sulfur dips at a dilution of 1 : 40 may be used for up to 6 weeks. 40, 41 Unfortunately, the use of lime sulfur dips will result in discoloration of the fur and a very strong odor. Prednisone and antibiotics can be added systemically or topically to alleviate pruritus and secondary dermal bacterial infections. All animals in the household should be treated and the environment should be decontaminated to ensure complete resolution.",

Some ferrets may show no initial signs of obstruction but show lethargy or inappetence. Palpation of the abdomen will reveal a distended bladder and may elicit vocalization from pain. Males present more commonly for urethral obstruction, as stones will often become lodged at the base of the os penis.

Steps should be taken immediately to alleviate the build-up of urine, in obstructed ferrets, through catheterization or cystocentesis.",

Stones should then be submitted for analysis to determine the proper course of treatment and prevent further stone formation. Should removal of the stone be unsuccessful, a perineal urethrostomy is indicated. 21 This procedure should be performed caudal to the base of the os penis in males.

            "text": "Long-term treatment of urolithiasis requires the use of antimicrobial therapy for 10 to 14 days and a diet change to one that is higher in animal-based proteins. A commercially prepared ferret diet is specifi cally formulated to meet all of the dietary requirements of the species and is always recommended over any other diet option. High-quality cat or kitten diets also meet the need of high animal-based proteins and may be substituted. Urinary acidifi ers are generally not necessary when a proper diet is initiated. Struvite-dissolving diets also do not work well for the medical treatment of urolithiasis, as it is unpalatable and does not contain suffi cient protein for ferrets. 21 Neoplasia Ferrets were once thought to have a very low incidence of neoplasia. Although the true incidence is not known, the number of neoplastic cases has risen over the years. 16 This may be due, in part, to the recent increased popularity of the ferret as a pet and laboratory animal. Several etiologies have been proposed for the development of neoplastic diseases in the ferret, including genetic predisposition, early neutering at 5 to 6 weeks of age, the lack of a natural photoperiod, exposure to carcinogenic substances, as well as an infectious agent. 16, [44] [45] [46] [47] A variety of neoplastic diseases have been described in ferrets, but only a few are diagnosed with any regularity (e.g., adrenocortical cell tumors, insulinoma, lymphoma, cutaneous neoplasms). [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Tumors have been found in most systems of the ferret body, including the gastrointestinal, reproductive, urinary, hematologic, lymphoid, endocrine, integumentary, nervous, and musculoskeletal systems. 16, 47 ADRENAL GLAND DISEASE Adrenal gland disease is an endocrinopathic disease commonly found in ferrets in the United States, affecting middle-aged to older spayed or neutered ferrets. There is no sex predilection; males and females are equally affected. It is commonly diagnosed as adenoma, adrenocarcinoma, or adrenal hyperplasia. 33, 49, 50 Adrenal gland disease in ferrets differs from that of dogs in that the disease is characterized by the hypersecretion of sex steroids rather than cortisol. In ferrets, one or more sex steroids such as androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA), estradiol, or 17-\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) will be elevated, whereas cortisol levels are usually within a normal range. 33, 50, 51 The early age at which ferrets are spayed and neutered in the United States has been associated with development of the disease later in life. 33, [50] [51] [52] [53] It has been proposed that at the early time of spaying and neutering, there are undifferentiated gonadal cells associated with the adrenal gland. The removal of the testicles or ovary and uterus allow for the chronic, unregulated stimulation of these remaining gonadal cells within the adrenal cortex by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), resulting in ferret adrenal gland disease.",

            "text": "Options for the treatment of adrenal gland disease include medical or surgical therapy. 33, 49, 50, 58 Surgical treatment also provides the opportunity to explore the abdomen and surgically correct any abnormalities noted. The left adrenal gland is more easily removed, as the right adrenal gland is located adjacent to the caudal vena cava. When a single gland is affected, unilateral adrenalectomy should be performed and the contralateral gland debulked if necessary. If disease is present in both adrenal glands, complete removal of adrenal tissue may be diffi cult. Because of the close proximity of the right adrenal gland to the caudal vena cava, a partial adrenalectomy of the right gland and a complete adrenalectomy of the left gland are recommended. This technique also reduces the need for postsurgical supplemental glucocorticoid therapy. The reported recurrence rate with development of disease of the contralateral gland following unilateral adrenalectomy is 17%, whereas recurrence following subtotal bilateral adrenalectomy is 15% 7 to 22 months after surgery. 49, 58 Alternatively, medical therapy is an option in the treatment of adrenal gland disease. Mitotane was previously recommended for this treatment; however, unlike canine Cushing's disease, ferret adrenal gland disease is nonresponsive. Leuprolide acetate, a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone, is now recommended for the treatment of this disease in ferrets. It acts by suppressing the gonadotropins that are released by the pituitary gland, and it reduces elevated sex hormone levels and eliminates clinical signs. 53 A 3.75-mg, 30-day preparation of leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot, TAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Deerfi eld, IL) can be administered at a dose of 100 \u03bcg intramuscularly every 30 days for ferrets weighing less than 1 kg, and 200 \u03bcg intramuscularly every 30 days for ferrets over 1 kg. 59 Injections must continue to be administered at regular intervals to prevent redevelopment of clinical signs. The use of this drug may be cost-prohibitive for some clients, and response to the drug has been variable. The differences in response may be a function of the type of disease process present, hyperplasia versus adenoma or adenocarcinoma, but this has not been evaluated. Additionally, the long-term safety and effi cacy of Lupron administration has yet to be determined.",

It causes an increase in the basal insulin level, and it is highly responsive to stimulation yet unresponsive to inhibitory mediators. 50 Ferrets affected by insulinoma show signs of hypoglycemia, which may be variable depending on the degree of hypoglycemia and the rate of blood glucose decline. Early signs may be slow and insidious in their development and are not easily recognized by the owner. Such signs include a reduction in activity, weight loss, and diffi cult arousal from slumber. As the disease progresses and hypoglycemia worsens, more signifi cant clinical signs develop, such as hypothermia, ptyalism, mental dullness, tremors, acute collapse, or a classic glassy-eyed appearance. Because ptyalism is associated with nausea, other diseases such as gastric ulcers or foreign body should be ruled out. Ferrets severely affected by low blood glucose may even have seizures or be comatose. Signs of acute collapse or unresponsiveness can be reversed temporarily with the application of a dextrose solution on the oral mucosa. Insulinoma may also be inadvertently identifi ed in asymptomatic ferrets during the diagnostic work-up of disease processes.",

A 4-to 6-hour fast is helpful to determine a diagnosis; however, this is not recommended or necessary in animals showing clinical signs consistent with the disease. A human glucometer developed for diabetic patients facilitates measurement of blood glucose in practice, although these devices have not been validated for the ferret. Increased insulin levels and insulin : glucose ratio are also supportive of a diagnosis of insulinoma, but it is possible that ferrets with this disease may have normal insulin levels. 50, 62, 64 Additional parameters on a serum biochemical assay are typically within normal limits, with the exception of an elevated ALT. Radiography and ultrasonography are not helpful in the diagnosis of insulinoma in most cases, but they may assist in the identifi cation of concurrent disease or metastasis. Treatment of insulinoma may be accomplished medically or surgically. Medical treatment involves dietary management and the administration of prednisone, diazoxide, or octreotide, alone or in combination. 62 Prednisone acts by blocking peripheral uptake of glucose by cells and increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. Initially it can be dosed at 0.25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours, but it can be increased up to 2 mg/kg every 12 hours as needed to control hypoglycemia. Prednisone has the unfortunate characteristic of a bitter taste, and ferrets tend to object to its administration. To improve palatability and acceptance, preparations containing alcohol should be avoided. Pediatric formulations of prednisone and prednisolone are available: the formulations Orapred (Lyne Laboratories, Inc., Brockton, MA) and Pediapred (Medeva Pharmaceuticals, Rochester, NY) work quite well. Smaller doses of prednisone can be used when diazoxide, a benzothiadiazine derivative, is added to the treatment plan. Diazoxide functions to antagonize the effects of insulin. It too has a broad dose range, which can be started at 10 mg/kg orally and divided twice a day, and increased to 60 mg/kg divided twice daily as needed. 30 Disadvantages associated with diazoxide include expense and gastrointestinal complications (e.g., vomiting and anorexia). 50 A 50-mg/ml suspension of diazoxide is available (Proglycem; Baker Norton Pharmaceuticals, Miami, FL), as well as 100-mg pills (Proglycem; Schering Canada, Inc., Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada), which can be compounded to a suspension at a lesser expense to the owner. The use of prednisone and diazoxide in combination should improve the blood glucose levels of the ferret in 24 to 48 hours. As neither drug slows or stops tumor growth, the dosages will need to be increased periodically as the disease progresses. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreatic tumor. 62 Because Octreotide requires subcutaneous injection every 12 hours; it is rarely used to treat ferrets diagnosed with insulinoma. Dietary management involves the feeding of meals high in protein and fat, 3 to 4 times a day. Simple sugars should not be offered. The blood glucose is measured daily until clinical signs are eliminated and weekly until the fasting blood glucose is within the normal range; drug dosages should be adjusted as needed. Thereafter, the affected ferret's blood glucose level should be rechecked every 3 months to ensure successful treatment.",

It is typically diagnosed in ferrets aged 6 months to 1 year and 3 to 5 years. 46 Numerous tissues are associated with this disease, including peripheral and visceral lymph nodes, spleen, liver, intestines, bone marrow, lung, and kidney. 47 In young ferrets, the disease has an acute onset and is characterized by a rapidly progressive, multicentric distribution of disease, commonly involving hematopoietic and lymphatic tissues, lung and kidney. 44, 46 Adult lymphoma is more chronic and survival times tend to be greater. The cluster outbreaks that have occurred in juveniles have led to the suspicion that a viral agent, specifi cally a retrovirus, may play a role in the etiology of juvenile lymphoma, and is currently under investigation. 45 FeLV and ADV have been suggested as pos sible etiologic agents, but testing has not supported this theory. 45, 46 Nonspecifi c clinical signs are often associated with lymphoma in the ferret (e.g., anorexia, weight loss, lethargy). 44, 47 Mediastinal lymphoma, a common fi nding in young ferrets, may result in dyspnea, coughing, or regurgitation ( Figure  13-4) . Adults may exhibit intermittent nonspecifi c signs that improve with corticosteroid use. Emesis, diarrhea, or tenesmus may be observed in ferrets with gastrointestinal or abdominal lymphoma, and the patient may have multiple palpable masses in the abdomen or peripheral lymphadenopathy. The peripheral lymph nodes are often surrounded by fat and should not be confused with enlarged lymph nodes that are a consequence of lymphosarcoma. Splenomegaly is a common fi nding and may be a result of neoplastic infi ltrate or extramedullary hematopoiesis.",

Fine needle aspiration and biopsy are quite useful for the defi nitive diagnosis of lymphoma. A fi ne needle aspirate should be performed on any masses or pleural effusion. The thoracic aspirate of pleural effusion allows for the differentiation between lymphoma, cardiac disease, pyothorax, or chylothorax. A bone marrow aspirate should be performed on any ferrets with evidence of leukemia, anemia, or atypical lymphocytes on the CBC. A peripheral lymph node biopsy or nodectomy with subsequent histopathologic evaluation of the tissue sample, particularly of the popliteal lymph node, is ideal for confi rming a diagnosis of lymphoma in the ferret. 47 This can be benefi cial in determining the diagnosis even if performed on a lymph node of normal size. Histopathologic examination of an enlarged peripheral lymph node may reveal lymphoid hyperplasia, which is often caused by viral infection or chronic antigenic stimulation. Histopathologic classifi cation of ferret lymphoma cases are high grade, diffuse, small noncleaved, or immunoblastic in young. 44 Older ferret lymphoma cases have been classifi ed as mixed cell immunoblastic (most commonly) or mature lymphocytic.",

The ideal therapy is surgical removal of any solid masses combined with systemic che-motherapy. Young ferrets with multicentric distribution of disease typically respond poorly to chemotherapy and have short survival times. 44, 46 Ferrets with concurrent disease have a greater risk of complications associated with chemotherapy. Additionally, those that have been previously treated with corticosteroids have a poor response to chemotherapy. The prognosis for ferrets with no overt clinical signs, but which were diagnosed based on chronic lymphocytosis and a positive lymph node biopsy, is variable. 47 Older ferrets probably respond better because the neoplasia has a slower growth rate. Treatment should never be considered curative for a ferret patient diagnosed with lymphoma. Remission can be achieved with marked improvement or return to a clinically normal state. 47 Remission may be defi ned as resolution of organomegaly and a normal CBC. Biopsy, however, may show persistence of disease. Remission may last for 3 months to 5 years, during which time a patient's CBC should be monitored every 1 to 3 months. 47 Protocols for chemotherapy for lymphoma are listed in Table 13 -6. Before the initiation of chemotherapy a full patient evaluation should be made, consisting of a CBC, serum biochemistry panel, radiographs, and bone marrow aspirate. This allows for the complete assessment of the patient for risks associated with, and prognosis for, response to therapy. Patients with greater than 50% of the bone marrow composed of malignant cells are at a high risk for fatal complications from chemotherapy. 47 The client should be educated on the need for complete compliance, good nutritional support, and close monitoring of the patient. Side effects are dependent on the drugs that are used, but they are the same as those described in other species. Lethargy, posterior paresis, anorexia, vomiting, mild hair loss, dyspnea, and collapse are the most common side effects seen in ferrets. They may occur as soon as 1 to 2 days posttreatment or as late as 2 weeks posttreatment. 47 Veterinarians should always follow standard safety protocols when using antineoplastic drugs. Intravenous drug administration should be performed under anesthesia, using an indwelling catheter. To ensure patency, the catheter should always be fl ushed before drug administration, and extravasation should be managed according to procedures appropriate for the drug.",

            "text": "Jills are seasonally polyestrous, induced ovulators; thus, if they are not bred or artifi cially stimulated to ovulate, they will remain in estrus. 22 Ferrets are quite susceptible to the effects of estrogen, and those that remain in estrus for periods longer than a month are at great risk for developing estrogen-induced bone marrow hypoplasia. 21 Physical signs of hyperestrogenism are similar to those of adrenal gland disease and natural estrus, with ferrets exhibiting a fl eshy, swollen vulva, with or without discharge, and bilateral symmetric alopecia. Ferrets with hyperestrogenism are typically much younger than those with adrenal gland disease, with the average age being 1 to 2 years. In the United States, where ferrets are generally spayed before leaving a breeding facility, hyperestrogenism is rare. It is possible that a spayed female with remnant ovarian tissue may present for hyperestrogenism. When the bone marrow is affected in hyperestrogenism cases, ferrets will become lethargic, inappetent, and weak, and will show signs of pale mucous membranes and subcutaneous or mucosal hemorrhage (e.g., petechiation, ecchymosis). At the onset of estrus, the ferret's CBC will show a neutrophilia and thrombocytosis, but this will change to thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia when the bone marrow becomes affected. 21, 22 Hyperestrogenism can be distinguished from adrenal gland disease based on age, history, clinical signs, and a response to the administration of hormones to stimulate ovulation.",

The enlarged spleen can be easily palpated on physical exam, and any irregularities in shape should be noted. It is important to remember that the size of the spleen is not related to the severity of disease. A CBC and platelet count should provide a baseline of information and are important in ruling out lymphoma and hypersplenism. Hypersplenism is the excessive destruction of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and/or platelets and will be revealed as a cytopenia on the CBC. 25 For cases of suspected hypersplenism, a bone marrow aspirate is required, with results being normal or hypercellular. To adequately diagnose hypersplenism in the ferret, infection, neoplasia, and other causes of blood dyscrasias must be ruled out. Additional diagnostic tests to consider include radiographs, serum biochemistry panel (or at least a glucose level check), and urinalysis to rule out other disease processes, such as insulinoma or cardiac disease. A splenic biopsy can be helpful and should be obtained when surgery is required for a concurrent disease (e.g., insulinoma, adrenal gland disease). Histopathology often reveals extramedullary hematopoiesis and/or congestion in the absence of primary splenic disease. 25 If no other abnormalities are identifi ed and the ferret is determined to be clinically healthy, a record of the spleen size should be made, and subsequent evaluations should take place, at least on an annual basis. Splenectomy is not indicated in primary splenomegaly cases or cases of concurrently existing disease. When a concurrent disease process has been identifi ed, treatment should be directed at the primary disease, not the organ response. A splenectomy is indicated for ferrets experiencing discomfort due to the enlarged spleen when no other disease process has been identifi ed or there is risk of rupture. Splenectomy is also necessary for hypersplenism, splenitis, splenic neoplasia, torsion, rupture, or abcess. 25 Cases of hypersplenism may require whole blood transfusion before surgery to reduce intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage. Supportive care such as B vitamins, antibiotics, and nutritional support should also be considered for the splenectomized ferret.",

Radiographically a globoid heart is commonly present and may be accompanied by pleural effusion, pulmonary venous congestion, or a diffuse interstitial pattern. Additional fi ndings may include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and ascites. An ECG is helpful in the identifi cation of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances. Ideally the ECG should be performed without the aid of anesthesia. The ECG can be accomplished more effi ciently by removing the metal teeth of the clasps, to which ferrets actively object, and utilizing techniques of distraction such as a Nutri-Cal treat. Ferret ECGs on lead II have small P waves that are similar to cats and large R waves similar to dogs. 25 Additionally, the normal ferret ECG will contain short QT intervals and elevated ST segments. Abnormal fi ndings may include, but are not limited to, sinus tachycardia, atrial or ventricular premature complexes, sinus bradycardia, tall and wide QRS complexes, and depression of the ST segment. 25, 66 The presence of a second-or third-degree atrioventricular block is indicative of signifi cant heart disease. Echocardiography, also best performed without sedation, is useful in the assessment of chamber size, shape, function, pleural and pericardial effusion, and cardiac or mediastinal masses. Color fl ow Doppler imaging allows for evaluation of valvular insuffi ciency by providing information on the direction of blood fl ow and the presence of turbulance. 25 Additional tests, such as a CBC and serum biochemistry panel, can provide information of concurrent disease. Microfi larial testing and heartworm antigen testing can be used to diagnose heartworm disease. Thoracocentesis not only has diagnostic value but may also offer temporary respiratory relief to ferrets with pleural effusion.",

Furosemide can be used safely in ferrets to alleviate fl uid retention due to cardiac failure. The recommended dosage for furosemide is 2.5 to 4 mg/kg every 8 to 12 hours. 66 Digoxin, a positive inotrope, is integral to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. The recommended initial dosage is 0.01 mg/kg orally every 24 hours and it should be increased to every 12 hours or decreased to once every other day, depending on the case. Just as in dogs and cats, serum digoxin levels should be checked 8 hours posttreatment to ensure that therapeutic levels are reached (0.8-2.0 ng/ml). 25 The dosage is based on an estimated 75% lean body weight. 30 Ferrets should be monitored for side effects that may be associated with digoxin therapy, such as cardiac arrhythmias, inappetence, vomiting, and diarrhea. Digoxin should not be used in ferrets that are azotemic or hypokalemic or have frequent ventricular arrhythmias. Nitroglycerin 2% ointment is also benefi cial as a venodilator in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. It can be applied to a shaved area of the skin on the inner thigh or pinna, 1/8 inch in size, every 12 to 24 hours. 25, 30 ACE-inhibitors are used to reduce arteriolar and venous tone, to increase cardiac output, and decrease edema; however, ferrets are sensitive to their hypotensive effects and thus require close monitoring. After an initial low dose, the amount can be increased if there is no ill response (e.g., inappetence, lethargy). The recommended dosage for enalapril is 0.25 0.5 mg/kg orally every 24 to 48 hours. 30 Beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers may be used for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Their usage results in a decreased heart rate and increased diastolic fi lling. The recommended dose for atenolol is 6.25 mg orally every 24 hours, and propranolol is 0.2 to 1 mg/kg orally every 8 to 12 hours. 25, 30 Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is administered at a dose of 3.75 to 7.5 mg orally every 12 hours. 25 Side effects of diltiazem include arrhythmia, lethargy, and inappetence. Supportive care for the cardiac patient includes oxygen supplementation for dyspnea, restricted activity, and a low salt diet. The pro gnosis for ferrets with cardiac disease is guarded to poor, even with intensive medical treatment.",
