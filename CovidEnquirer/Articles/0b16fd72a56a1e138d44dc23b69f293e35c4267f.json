We hypothesized that alpaca and bovine cells have differential permissiveness and responses to BVDV infection. To characterize alpaca testicular (AT) and bovine turbinate (BT) cells BVDV infection permissiveness, viral replication and interferon (IFN) synthesis was evaluated. BVDV replicated 3-4 logs lower in AT cells with diminished antigen deposition compared to BT cells. BVDV infection inhibited IFN response in both AT and BT cells. Compared to BT cells, BVDV-infected AT cells had a 2-5 fold increase in IFN synthesis following dsRNA stimulation. The greater IFN response of AT cells compared to BT cells following poly I:C stimulation with or without ncp BVDV infection, may be the basis for the decreased BVDV permissiveness of AT cells and may contribute to the clinical differences following BVDV infection of alpacas and cattle.",

BVDV causes gastroenteritis, immunosuppression and abortion in infected cattle (Galav et al., 2007; Janzen and Clark, 1995; Kelling et al., 1990) . The most insidious effect of BVDV infection is the causation of persistently-infected (PI) calves and crias, due to in utero infection and immunotolerance of the fetus to the infecting BVDV strain. PI animals shed virus throughout their lifetime and provide a reservoir of BVDV infection in herds (McClurkin et al., 1985; Topliff et al., 2009) .",

Interferons are inducible cytokines which defend the host against infection by activating cellular factors to shut down viral mRNA synthesis and degrade viral RNA (Castelli et al., 1997) and to promote the activity of natural killer cells (Sato et al., 2001) , B cells (Jego et al., 2003; Litniskiy et al., 2002) and T cells (Foster et al., 2004; Le Bon et al., 2003; Rogge et al., 1998) for systemic protection. Evasion of this host immune response is crucial for both acute and persistent infections with BVDV. BVDV has been shown to inhibit the synthesis of IFN (Schweizer et al., 2006) and can also inhibit production of molecules stimulated by IFN synthesis such as Mx protein (Schweizer and Peterhans, 2001) .",

BVDV-specific cytoplasmic antigen in alpaca cells stained less intensely and less frequently compared to bovine cells ( Figs. 1 and 2) . AT cells infected with the BVDV1 alpaca origin isolate CO-06 had a greater frequency of viral antigen staining, with the majority of cells stained, as opposed to isolated clusters of stained cells seen in AT cells infected with the other BVDV isolates, NY-1, 890 and 7937. The reduction in cytoplasmic viral antigen staining was most apparent in AT cells infected with the BVDV2 isolates, 890 and 7937 wherein specific cytoplasmic staining of viral antigen occurred in isolated clusters of cells with less intense staining than observed in infected BT cells (Fig. 2) . The greater frequency and intensity of BVDV1 CO-06 viral antigen staining in AT cells when compared to BVDV2 isolates correlates with calculated titer means (Figs. 3 and 4).

This correlated with decreased intensity and frequency of BVDV-specific antigen staining in alpaca cells compared to bovine cells infected with the BVDV isolates. The lower viral titers and diminished BVDV antigen staining in the alpaca cells compared to the bovine cells suggests that alpaca cells are less permissive than BT cells to BVDV infection.

None of the infected animals The reduced permissiveness of alpaca cells to BVDV infection reported in this study and the diminished clinical disease following BVDV infection in alpacas is similar to the report that pigs are less permissive to BVDV infection and did not exhibit clinical signs of disease following infection with BVDV1 or BVDV2 (Walz et al., 1999) . BVDV1 was isolated from serum and tissue samples collected from infected pigs; however, BVDV2 was isolated only from tissue samples (Walz et al., 1999) . The differences seen between BVDV1 and BVDV2 infections in pigs correlates with our observations in alpaca and bovine cell culture. Alpaca cells were more permissive to BVDV1 infections with BVDV1 replicating to a significantly (p = 0.0238) higher titer compared to BVDV2 in alpaca cells, with the BVDV1 alpaca isolate CO-06 having a significantly greater titer than BVDV1 bovine isolate NY-1 (p = 0.0307) and the BVDV2 isolates 890 and 7937 (p = 0.0344).

This suggests that alpaca cells are more permissive and better adapted for infection with BVDV1 than BVDV2. The predominance of BVDV1b in alpacas could also be a reflection of the regional predominance of BVDV1b in nature.",

In our study, ncp BVDV viruses were poor inducers of type I IFN with no significant difference in IFN induction between alpaca and bovine cells following infection, which corresponds to previous work (Gil et al., 2006a; Schweizer et al., 2006) . However, alpaca cells synthesized a significantly greater level of IFN following stimulation with poly I:C compared to bovine cells. Similarly, BVDVinfected alpaca cells responded to poly I:C stimulation with significantly greater levels of IFN synthesis than bovine cells. IFN responses are an essential component of the host innate immune defense against viral infections. The more robust IFN response of alpaca cells compared to bovine cells following poly I:C stimulation alone and following infection with ncp BVDV may be the basis for decreased permissiveness of AT cells compared to BT cells. Replication of classical swine fever virus, a pestivirus, was inhibited by recombinant type I IFN (Xia et al., 2005) . Suppression of IFN synthesis in BVDV-infected cells has been associated with BVDV proteins N pro and E rns . Lymphoid cells have been recovered from cattle that are able to produce IFN after infection with ncp BVDV. These bovine lymphoid cells synthesize type I IFN without expressing NS3 antigens (Brackenbury et al., 2005) . Similarly, the elevated IFN response in alpaca cells when stimulated with dsRNA, in addition to the reduced inhibition of IFN synthesis following post-infection stimulation with dsRNA in cell culture, suggests that alpaca cells may be able to produce IFN effectively following infection in the host. The reduced or lack of antigen expression in IFN producing bovine lymphoid cells closely parallels the reduced antigen expression seen in our study with alpaca cells.",

NY-1 BVDV replicated to significantly higher levels in BT cells than in AT cells, while BVDV CO-06 replicated to comparable levels in both cell types. These results correlate with results of the IFN inhibition assay. Both alpaca and bovine cells infected with BVDV CO-06, followed by stimulation with poly I:C, were able to synthesize high levels of IFN, which could interfere with the replication of the virus following both infection and electroporation of BVDV RNA. BVDV NY-1 significantly inhibited IFN synthesis in bovine cells, but not in alpaca cells, also correlating with the increased replication seen in bovine but not alpaca cells following transfection. The E rns protein of BVDV has been shown to inhibit activation of IFN synthesis by extracellular dsRNA but not intracellular RNA, which may also explain the reduced replication of BVDV CO-06 following transfection (Magkouras et al., 2008) . Additional genomic studies directed toward defining genomic differences between CO-06 and NY-1 may help to elucidate this phenomenon.",

Acute BVDVinfected alpacas exhibit diminished clinical parameters of disease, such as antigen deposition in lymphoid tissues, when compared to clinical signs in acute BVDV-infected calves (Kelling et al., 1990 (Kelling et al., , 2002 Wentz et al., 2003) .
