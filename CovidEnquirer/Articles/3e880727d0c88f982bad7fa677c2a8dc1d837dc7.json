            "text": "D isaster refers to a significant functional deterioration or loss of life, material, economy or environmental resources. 1 The magnitude, frequency, and type of disaster events vary as per to the geographical location, ethnicities, and economic capacities. 2 Natural and human-induced disasters befall every day throughout the biosphere and cause catastrophic impacts on public health in terms of injuries, sufferings, deaths, destruction of infrastructure, and facility. 2 Conferring to the World Disasters Report (2016), earthquakes, landslides, floods, and heat waves led to 574 reported disasters and had resulted of 32,550 human deaths. In 2015, the majority if disasters' deaths (67% of the global deaths) were in Asia, and it was beyond 50.5% of the decade's annual average. 3 The occurrence of multiple casualty incidents (MCIs), such as swine flu pandemics had transformed healthcare workers' perception towards disaster preparedness. Countries were encouraged to respond to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) request to take up major steps to ensure safe health care facilities during the emergency. Such response must include evaluation of hospital safety; training and protection of health personnel for emergencies; planning a strategy to handle an emergency; designing and building durable hospitals; adopting national programs and policies; and protecting medical and ordinary equipment, materials, and supplies. 4, 5 During and after the catastrophic disasters, hospitals are considered as the safest environment for people as they provide vital care to the casualties. The unpredictable disasters and the multifacet damages warrant the healthcare providers to be prepared and handle the victims with various capabilities and care, to lessen the impact of disasters. 6, 7 Moreover, they need to play a crucial role in emergency preparedness and disaster response plan. This would confirm their personnel readiness for disaster from the beginning. Such a readiness may be achieved throughout the periodic training and mock codes, in addition to being aware of any changes or updates in the standing disaster management guidelines. 8 Despite improved public awareness towards the MCIs, threat and various guidelines recommended for hospital disaster plans by several agencies, the emphasis on preparing healthcare workforce for such disasters is inadequate. 9, 10 Specifically, the majority of the reported data on disaster preparedness is based on the literature of systems-level responses rather than institutional and individual responses. 10 Physicians and nurses comprise the highest percentage of health and medical workforce. They must understand the national disaster management cycle. Without their integration at every phase, communities and clients lose a critical part of prevention network. A previous study assessing the knowledge and skills among emergency nurses showed that they were confident in terms of disaster handling, but they were not trained for the same. 11 Another study was performed on nurses reported average percentage scores in the domains of knowledge, attitudes and practice towords disaster and emergency preparedness. 12 A growing number of studies in the literature reported facts about Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's disaster management and preparedness. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Bajow et al, 20 evaluated hospital disaster preparedness in Jeddah region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and showed that although study hospital had the tools and quality indicators for emergency preparedness, staff are lacking the proper training and management of disaster. Moreover, quite a few studies have reported variety in staff knowledge, training and education regarding preparedness for disaster emergency incidents. [14] [15] [16] 19, 21 Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, practices, and attitudes regarding disaster and emergency preparedness among ED staff at a tertiary health care hospital.",

[22] [23] [24] The questionnaire was divided into 5 sections. The first section focused on participants' demographics (age, gender, profession, total years of experience, and total years of experience at the current hospital). The second section assessed participants' knowledge about disaster management and preparedness. It included 8 multiple choice questions, where each question was coded as correct=1 and incorrect=0. The third section focused on participants' attitudes about disaster planning. A checklist consisting of 11 items was prepared and was categorized as agree, disagree, and unsure responses. The fourth one focused on participants' current role and practices. It included questions about disaster drills performed at their healthcare setting, ongoing training, and disaster plan update. Participants' familiarity towards emergency (fifth section) preparedness was assessed using a selfadministered EPIQ, which is a reliable, valid, and has been employed in many studies. 25 The EPIQ survey comprised of 2 parts. Part one related to the overall familiarity with emergency preparedness and involved 45 familiarity answers, assembled in 11 subscales. The subscales encompassed of 7 questions concerned with the familiarity with emergency preparedness activities and terms; 8 questions with the incident command system; 4 questions with triage ethical issues; 4 questions with epidemiology and surveillance; 2 questions with isolation/quarantine; 3 questions with decontamination; 7 questions with communication/ connectivity; 4 questions with psychological issues; 2 questions with special populations; 3 questions with accessing critical resources, and one question with overall familiarity. Likert scale was used to categorized the questionnaire and ranged from \"extremely familiar\" (numbered as 5) to \"not at all familiar\" as follow: \"not at all familiar\", \"slightly familiar\", \"somewhat familiar\", \"moderately familiar\", and \"extremely familiar.",

Instead, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to take a traditional health approach about their response to emergencies and disasters. 27 The WHO recommends countries to prepare comprehensive disaster management plans which could be used to meet the challenges associated with lowest to the highest level of disaster. 2 A previous study by Ogedegbe et al, 28 also highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness training among healthcare providers. Another study by Corrigan et al, 25 assessing disaster preparedness in an Australian urban trauma center reported that out of 140 respondents, 83 participants (59.3%) were previously trained to handle disaster, 53 (37.9%) had attended drill for disaster simulation whereas, 18 (12.9%) had actually handled a disaster. The study further highlighted that these participants were more prepared to handle such situations as compared to the ones with no such disaster handling or disaster-related training or simulation experience. 25 A questionnaire survey conducted on practicing registered 174 (out of which 164 responded) nurses to explore Hong Kong nurses' disaster preparedness expressed their inadequacy in terms of disaster preparedness. Furthermore, they suggested to include disaster management training in their basic curriculum. 20 Furthermore, a cross-sectional study was conducted employing a self-administered survey to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practice nurses' (n=607) working in 4 tertiary hospitals and 2 secondary hospitals. The nurses reported average percentage scores in the knowledge (66.33%), attitudes (68.87%), and practice (67.60%), which indicated the need to develop and cultivate strategies to advance nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and practice. 12 Many studies from Kingdom of saudi Arabia have assessed the emergency or disaster preparedness among hospital staff. A recent observational cross-sectional survey study by Shalhoub et al, 19 identifying disaster preparedness in 13 private Riyadh hospitals reported 12 (92.3%) hospitals to cover both internal and external disasters, and they all had disaster preparedness available in every department of the hospital. Another study assessing the knowledge, role awareness and skills in 106 hospital emergency nurses reported from 4 public hospitals reported high awareness as 85.7% of participants were confident in terms of disaster handling. However, they were not trained for the same. 11 A study by Gundran et al, 29 also conducted a similar study including 91 participants. Most of the participants, 98.4% in the present study and 97.8% in the study by Gundran et al, 29 considered training necessary for all healthcare workers. About 97.8% (in contrast to 100% in the present study), expected management to have updated disaster plan. About 65% (in comparison with 34.9% individuals in the present study) of participants thought that disasters are unlikely to happen in their hospitals. 29 Saudi Med J 2018; Vol. 39 (11) www.smj.org.sa One of the limitations in this study that it is a corss-sectional study based on self-reported data (questionnaire), the filling of which may be affected by time constraint, stress, and other such factors.
