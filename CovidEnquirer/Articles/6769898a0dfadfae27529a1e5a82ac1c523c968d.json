Little is known about the dynamic changes of the viral replicative form in SARS cases. Objectives: Evaluate whether SARS-CoV can infect and replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected persons and reveal any dynamic changes to the virus during the course of the disease. Study design: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from SARS cases infected by the same infectious source were tested for both negative-stranded RNA (minus -RNA, ''replicative intermediates'') and positivestranded RNA (genomic RNA) of SARS-CoV during the course of hospitalization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: SARS-CoV minus -RNA was detected in PBMCs from SARS patients. The viral replicative forms in PBMCs were detectable during a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, while the plus -RNA were detectable for a longer period (8 \u00c1/12 days post-onset). Conclusions: SARS-coronavirus can infect and replicate within PBMCs of SARS patients, but viral replication in PBMCs seems subject to self-limitation. #",

Among them, the eldest sister, who was from Beijing, had a fever and a cough that had started on 11 April but the family members did not suspect their eldest sister being infected by SARS-CoV, and took no protective measures. After the family gathering, the eldest sister returned to Beijing, where she was soon admitted to hospital and diagnosed as a definite SARS case on 15 April. The three family members reported here came back to Hangzhou City on 14 April.

The plus -RNA was present in their pharyngeal gargling solutions and PBMCs, but not detectable in their blood plasma, while the minus -RNA form was only detected in PBMCs from Patients 2 and 3. Patient 1 was negative for the SARS-CoV minus -RNA in his PBMCs on this day. (2) One day later, the patients' conditions became worse. Their samples were all positive for both the SARS plus -and minus-RNA. By day 5 after admission, the SARS-coronaviral minus-RNA was detectable only in PBMCs from Patient 1, the other two testing negative. By day 7, the minus-RNA in PBMCs from Patient 1 was no longer detectable (till 23 May). Results for the other two patients are shown in Fig. 2 . Briefly, the detectable period of the SARS-Coronaviral replicative intermediate minus-stranded RNA in the three patients was within 6 days post-onset of the disease only, while the plus genomic RNA remained detectable for a longer period (8 \u00c1/12 days post-onset) (Fig. 2) . Essentially, the minusstranded RNA was detected in PBMCs only.",

At least five subgenomic mRNAs were detected by Northern hybridization of RNA from SARS-CoV-infected cells (Paul et al., 2003) . Accordingly, SARS-CoV uses minus -RNA as some kind of 'replicative intermediates' during its replication cycle in cells.

Nuclear acid sequence analyses of the PCR products showed full homology to the SARS-CoV genomic sequences. This supports the idea that SARS-coronavirus was not only passively adhering to the PBMCs but had infected the cells and replicated within them. This is the first report showing the presence of SARS-coronavirus minus -RNA, supposed to represent replicative intermediates of its RNA, and the duration of such RNA in PBMCs during the course of SARS in patients, indicating that the virus can attack and replicate in PBMCs. It may partially help to explain why mild leukopenia or lymphopenia has been observed in SARS patients (Poutanen et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003) . The detectable period of SARS-CoV replication in PBMCs of our three patients was less than 1 week, which suggests that viral replication in the cells is probably self-limited.",

The presence of the minus -RNA reflecting 'replicative intermediates' of this CoV in PBMCs is limited to within a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, suggesting that replication in the PBMCs is subject to self-limitation. Our results raise questions requiring further studies, PBMCs being in fact mixtures of various types of cells. Finding out which type(s) of PBMCs are the main target for invasion and replication by SARS-CoV will be important in the search for molecules or receptors which can bind to the virus at the surface of these cells. This will facilitate the design and development of drugs to block the binding of SARS-CoV to susceptible cells. Also, our results should be valuable in helping to determine the administration of anti-virus and immunomodulator for SARS in clinical practice.",
