            "text": "The most common acute viral infections of the CNS are aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. Meningitis is inflammation of the meningeal layers surrounding the brain, involving headache, fevers, and meningismus. Encephalitis involves the brain parenchyma and alterations of the cerebral function. Other symptoms of encephalitis include fevers, headache, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. Inflammation rarely confines itself to the meninges or parenchyma. As such, there is significant clinical overlap between these entities, termed \"meningoencephalitis.\" Nonetheless, the predominating features are useful for clinical distinction and treatment decisions. 3 Distinguishing viral from other causes of meningoencephalitis is challenging. History, exposures, imaging, and laboratory work are helpful in determining a cause. 3 History and exposures for common entities are detailed later. Temporal lobe encephalitis on imaging is suggestive of a viral cause, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV). Another useful clue is the finding of hydrocephalus, rarely seen with viral CNS infections. 4 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is the most important test for identifying a cause for CNS infections. The characteristic CSF profile for viral infection in lymphocytepredominant leukocytosis (neutrophils may predominate very early in infection, but this will shift rapidly) is elevated protein less than 150 mg/dL, normal glucose concentration, ",

For example, it is not uncommon to identify CMV on BAL specimens in hosts who are asymptomatically shedding. The context of the host and pathogen should be considered. Clinically significant CMV reactivation is unusual in immune competent hosts, and detection in this setting does not equate to disease. Diagnosis of CMV pneumonia requires pneumonitis, usually identified via biopsy. 35 Another consideration in viral respiratory infections is concomitant bacterial superinfection. Viral pneumonia renders a host more susceptible to other infections, and severe bacterial pneumonias can develop concomitantly. This is well described with influenza, in which much of the 1918 H1N1 appeared to occur 7 to 14 days postinfection because of pneumonias, particularly Streptococcus pneumonia. 36 that have proven reliably effective.
