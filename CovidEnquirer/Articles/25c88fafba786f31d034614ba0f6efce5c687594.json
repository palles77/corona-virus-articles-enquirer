The present study investigates outcomes with respect to cardiopulmonary arrest rates in institutions with and without rapid response systems (RRSs) and the current level of cardiopulmonary arrest rate in tertiary hospitals. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on data from 14 tertiary hospitals. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate reports were obtained from each hospital to include the number of cardiopulmonary arrest events in adult patients in the general ward, the annual adult admission statistics, and the structure of the RRS if present. Results: Hospitals with RRSs showed a statistically significant reduction of the CPR rate between 2013 and 2015 (odds ratio [OR], 0.731; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.577 to 0.927; P = 0.009). Nevertheless, CPR rates of 2013 and 2015 did not change in hospitals without RRS (OR, 0.988; 95% CI, 0.868 to 1.124; P = 0.854). National university-affiliated hospitals showed less cardiopulmonary arrest rate than private university-affiliated in 2015 (1.92 vs. 2.40; OR, 0.800; 95% CI, 0.702 to 0.912; P = 0.001). High-volume hospitals showed lower cardiopulmonary arrest rates compared with medium-volume hospitals in 2013 (1.76 vs. 2.63; OR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.577 to 0.772; P < 0.001) and in 2015 (1.55 vs. 3.20; OR, 0.485; 95% CI, 0.428 to 0.550; P < 0.001). Conclusions: RRSs may be a feasible option to reduce the CPR rate. The discrepancy in cardiopulmonary arrest rates suggests further research should include a nationwide survey to tease out factors involved in in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and differences in outcomes based on hospital characteristics.",

            "text": "volume hospitals. This tendency was presumed to be due to the strong medical and human resources available in national university-affiliated hospitals and high-volume hospitals. While all high-volume hospitals had dedicated intensivists, only 57% (four of seven hospitals) of me-dium-volume hospitals had them. None of the mediumvolume hospitals had an RRS. Furthermore, three of five national university-affiliated hospitals (60%) were highvolume hospitals, whereas four of nine private hospitals (44%) were high-volume hospitals, which could explain the differences between cardiopulmonary arrest at national university-affiliated hospitals and private hospitals (SupplementaryTable 2). However, these results should be interpreted with caution because this study was not a comprehensive investigation, but instead only compared the structural characteristics of a few hospitals. All included hospitals were tertiary hospitals and were accredited by Ministry of Health and Welfare. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the levels of care were above standard.In 2015, hospitals in the capital area demonstrated a lower cardiopulmonary arrest rate than those in provincial areas. Two of these were high-volume hospitals, but that difference does not fully establish an inference related with patient volume. Although we could not entirely rule out a selection bias in our sampling methods, this result might suggest that the discrepancy in cardiopulmonary arrest rate is due to a local gap in medical services as well as the severity of patient illnesses and comorbidities. This is the first multicenter survey on the impacts of RRSs in Korea. To avoid selection bias, we made efforts to study hospitals with similar characteristics. First, we corrected combined probability sampling with nonprobability sampling. Second, we excluded data from hospitals that recorded the highest and lowest cardiopulmonary arrest rates and from the period when EMRs were not used.However, there are some limitations to this investigation.This study was a retrospective analysis that only included data from 14 of the 43 tertiary hospitals, which could have introduced a selection bias. Regarding the data, we collected admission statistics from each hospital and did not review individual medical records. Each hospital had a different system of reporting CPR rates, including standards to fulfill CPR reports and responsible parties.",
