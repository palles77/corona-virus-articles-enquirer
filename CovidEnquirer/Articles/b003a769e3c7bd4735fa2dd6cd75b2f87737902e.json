Since the late 1970s it has undergone considerable changes, since reforms known as the Four Modernizations improved agriculture, industry, technology, and defense, vastly raising living standards and making China one of the great powers. As a global city, Shanghai exerts influence over commerce, finance, culture, art, fashion, research, and entertainment. The city is located in the middle portion of the Chinese coast, and sits at the mouth of the Yangtze River (2) . It is administratively a municipality that is equal to a province, is an autonomous region, and is divided into 18 county-level divisions, including 17 districts and one county ( Figure 1 ). There is no single downtown district in Shanghai. The urban core is scattered across nine districts that are collectively referred to as Shanghai Proper or the city center, and these account for three-fourths of the entire city.",

Females account for about 50.1% of the entire population, slightly outnumbering males. The ratio of urban-to-rural population has been increasing for several years. The birth rate is one of the lowest in China, with 6.62 per 1000 persons (the rate for China overall is 12.13 per 1000 persons) and the mortality rate is 7.64 per 1000 persons. The average life expectancy at birth is 81.73 years (79.42 years for males and 84.06 years for females). Only 10.4% of the population is aged younger than 18 years, with 24.1%, 43.0%, and 22.5% being 18-34 years, 35-59 years, and at least 60 years old, respectively. The growing elderly population has resulted in an increased need for proper emergency care. In 2009, there were 2.7 doctors per 1000 persons and 4.1 hospital beds per 1000 persons. Emergency medical services provided to persons aged older than 60 years made up 61.6% of the whole service, whereas 4.4%, 12.7%, and 21.3% of the service was provided to those aged younger than 18 years, 18-34 years, and 35-59 years, respectively.",

They are: purely prehospital care, independent emergency service center, prehospital care supported by general hospital, unified communication command center, and integrated within fire and police departments (5) . For many years, Shanghai has employed the purely prehospital care model, comprising mainly a prehospital emergency service with no sickbeds, known as the Shanghai model, which is similar to emergency medical services in Germany. Many major Chinese cities, including Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Hangzhou, also use this model. Beijing, formerly in the model of independent emergency service centers, also has been using the Shanghai model since 2005, mainly due to the rapid development and internationalization of the city (6). This means that an independent prehospital center with its own inpatient department cannot completely meet the needs of the citizens. Although much progress has been achieved over the last 5 years, during which the 11 th 5-year guideline (a scheduled plan announced by the Shanghai government every 5 years which sets the 5 years' developing goal for Shanghai) has been applied, Emergency Medicine and prehospital emergency medical care in Shanghai are still in the \"developing\" phase.",

These 10 centers work independently, and generally, SEMC can give advice for emergency care only to the nine suburban district (county)-level emergency centers. SEMC serves the nine districts in the city center, whereas the nine district (county)-level emergency centers in the suburbs are responsible for prehospital care of their own district or county.

From the establishment of new China in 1949 to the end of the 11 th 5-year construction, Shanghai experienced vast change in the system. Through 60 years' practice and development, a unique operational prehospital care model has been formed with the characteristics of unity of command, district-level dispatch system, distributed ambulance depots, on-the-spot medical aid, and fast transport. Whereas few ambulance or emergency telephones could be found in 1949, Ambulance Command has evolved into a modern prehospital service provider with a well-decorated urban ambulance dispatch center equipped with Global Posi-tioning System, Global Information System, wireless communication system, and other advanced command system elements that can be expanded quickly in case of mass casualty incidents. It includes more than 500 ambulances and over 111 ambulance depots. However, prehospital emergency medical care in Shanghai is currently provided by only about 800 prehospital emergency caregivers, 219 of whom are Emergency Physicians. These numbers are substantially lower than the targets set for medical staff by the Shanghai 11 th 5-year guideline for EMSS (Table 1) . Because an Emergency Physician must accompany each ambulance run, this means the maximum of the ambulances that can be dispatched to provide prehospital emergency care is 219, even though there are more than 500 ambulances in the city.",

All of the dispatch units in the city center or suburban areas can be accessed by dialing the unique emergency telephone number, 120, on a telephone. Most of the dispatchers are trained as physicians, nurses, or other health care professionals. They have to undergo additional ambulance dispatch training before being allowed to take emergency calls in the centers. However, because no certification, degree, or special continuing education programs are offered for prehospital emergency medical care, most of the training courses are informal and the apprentice model is generally used to train the EMS dispatchers. Unfortunately, this makes the dispatch process non-standard and may even bring potential harm to patient care. The main duties of the dispatchers are receiving emergency calls, assessment of the received information, and dispatch of an emergency service team to the scene. The dispatchers also cooperate with the police, fire department, and other relevant services, and give telephone medical advice to callers. According to the incomplete data from SEMC, in 2009 the dispatchers received 6000-8000 ambulance calls per day, and the peak flow of ambulance dispatch by SEMC was 927 per day.",

The target response time, from receipt of the call to the arrival of the emergency ambulance services, is 15 min, and it is higher in rural areas. With a network of ambulances and the new urban service radius, the average response interval in the city center can be expected to be reduced to 10 min. The reasons for the long response time at the present time are complex, and include: too few available ambulances and too few ambulance depots, traffic congestion, helicopter unavailability (only one helicopter station in the whole city), and so on. At present, there are seven dispatch units in Shanghai. Emergency calls are transferred, depending on the location where the emergency occurs or the type of call. All of the requests from mobile phones and those from landlines in the city center and new districts MinHang, BaoShan, and PuDong are connected to the dispatch center of SEMC, whereas others are connected or transferred to suburban centers. Direct lines and hospital-on-thenet allow the dispatch units to contact the ambulance depots. Wireless communications between dispatch units and ambulances also play an important role. Currently, emergency telephone calls to 110 or 119 are handled by the police or the fire department, and the direct lines between the police and fire brigade to the dispatch units allow the calls to be responded to as quickly as possible. Considering the potential delay from calling to dispatch, most of the dispatch units are now considering integrating with the fire brigade and the police.",

When there is a major incident involving a large number of patients that requires more ambulances, the MCTC is dispatched. The MCTC, which is supplied with more sophisticated equipment in larger quantities than a standard ambulance, has played an important role in response to major incidents. One such incident was the Shanghai 11.15 major fire disaster of November 15, 2010, when MCTC provided advanced life support to the victims with the help of medical equipment such as a ventilator, advanced airway, transcutaneous cardiac pacemaker, and glucometer. A standard ambulance is usually fitted with a communication system such as a two-way radio, and medical supplies and equipment such as a defibrillator/monitor, syringe driver, suction machine, medications, infusions, intubation equipment, immobilization equipment, stretcher, emergency suitcase, and backpack.",

As in the German system, instead of paramedics, there are Emergency Physicians working in Shanghai's ambulances, who typically graduate from medical school after 5 years' education. Besides the general medical education requirement, no other special qualifications are required to be an Emergency Physician. Every ambulance must be staffed with an Emergency Physician who can provide all necessary interventions on site or during transport. Because Emergency Physicians were part of the Shanghai EMS system from its very beginning, it was thought that there was no need for non-physicians working in the ambulances to learn to perform interventions that legally only physicians are allowed to do, and there was no need for them to receive formal training. Therefore, no staff member other than the Emergency Physician is formally authorized to give medications, establish intravenous access, defibrillate, or perform tracheal intubation. For these reasons, there is a large shortage of Emergency Physicians. To meet the high demands of EMS in Shanghai, the staff in the ambulance generally works 24-h shifts, and the number of shifts per month varies.",

However, when another public health emergency, avian influenza, hit Shanghai in 2006, changes in policy were implemented rapidly and information was disseminated effectively to all personnel. In March and April of 2009, when an outbreak of a new strain of influenza commonly referred to as \"swine flu\" infected many people in the world, all prehospital emergency care personnel in Shanghai were put on high alert.

During this advancing progress, more emphasis should be placed on full implementation of more evidence-based advanced prehospital interventions, as well as on area-wide emergency care including both metropolitan and rural settings. To provide an optimal level of emergency care, there is a need to increase the number of qualified emergency personnel, especially Emergency Physicians, and implement medical control and oversight for the EMSS. Furthermore, efforts are needed to improve the efficiency and quality of the EMS system, such as public education, improving patient outcomes, increasing patient satisfaction, and development of disaster preparedness.",

Formal emergency medical dispatcher training courses also should be implemented for dispatchers. Although physician-staffed ambulances will continue to play a role in the EMS, a potential solution to the problem of ambulance staff shortage is to staff some ambulances with emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. It may be a choice to organize different types of rescue teams similar to those in other countries such as Germany and France (10, 11) . The EMT/paramedic-based models of prehospital care, as used in the United States, also should be considered (12) . Non-urgent patient transport (where staff includes only the driver or a technician and a driver) could be separated from EMS. There is a need to improve coordination with other services within and between hospitals, as well as with prehospital services. Enhanced coordination would have a variety of benefits for all concerned, including better EMS relationships, better handover, better transfers, and enhanced EMS personnel skills. It is essential to develop major incident and disaster plans and to promote organization for major emergencies in the various settings. Special training courses and frequent drill exercises are also needed to improve the EMS capability of coping with disaster.",
