            "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is present within the ventricular system of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the subarachnoid space (SAS) between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. CSF is a component of, and is continuous with, the interstitial fluid of the central nervous system (CNS). It is separated from the bloodstream and from the CNS parenchyma by an intricate barrier system comprising ependymal epithelium, choroid plexus epithelium, the leptomeninges, areas of modified leptomeninges, and the arachnoid villi (the reader is referred elsewhere for a thorough discussion of these barriers and their transport mechanisms). 1,2 CSF has mechanical (protection) and metabolic (transport, excretion) functions. Sampling of the CSF is an important part of the minimum database for patients with neurological signs and may be useful in monitoring response to therapy in CNS inflammatory disease. When performed correctly, acquisition is a rapid, inexpensive, and technically simple method of sampling the local environment of the CNS extracellular space for evidence of inflammatory, neoplastic, traumatic, or degenerative disease. It is not without risk, however, and should be performed judiciously, that is, when clinical indication exists and no contraindications are present. This chapter will review the biology of CSF, methods for collection, and causes for abnormalities in parameters, such as protein concentration and nucleated cell count.",

            "text": "Analysis of CSF is an important adjunctive diagnostic tool in the workup of patients with CNS disease and must be interpreted within the context of the patient's history, clinical signs, clinicopathological data, imaging studies, and other ancillary diagnostics. Rarely is CSF solely used to provide an etiological diagnosis (exceptions include cytological visualization of infectious agents or overtly neoplastic cells), but analysis may significantly narrow the field of pathophysiological differentials, guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic options. CSF analysis is most sensitive in detecting inflammatory disease. 3 Positive findings in CSF tend to be more diagnostically helpful compared with negative findings but are often nonspecific because many different diseases may cause a common CSF pathology (e.g., neutrophilic pleocytosis). 4 Occasionally, the magnitude of change within the CSF may be as instructive as the character of the change (e.g., a marked increase in protein concentration raising diagnostic concern for feline infectious peritonitis, marked neutrophilic pleocytosis raising diagnostic concern for steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis in a young dog in pain). 4 More frequently, however, specific disease etiologies will present with CSF changes of variable character and magnitude. CSF that falls within laboratory reference intervals should never be used to rule out a differential diagnosis because negative findings may represent early or mild disease, disease suppressed or masked by therapeutic intervention, or a disease process that does not present within the particular area of the extracellular space being sampled. CSF analysis may or may not correlate with imaging studies; a retrospective study of 92 cats receiving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for spinal signs showed that abnormal CSF was not a predictor for abnormal MRI. 5 In another study, approximately 25% of dogs with intracranial signs and inflammatory CSF had normal brain MRI results. 6 ",

            "text": "The conventionally accepted theory of CSF secretion and transport is based on the concept of active transport of ions within the ventricular ependymal cells and choroid plexi, subsequent passive flow of fluid, and circulation and drainage of CSF into dural venous sinuses. These ideas have recently come under scrutiny as potentially simplistic and inconsistent with the past 100 years of experimental evidence. 7 Analysis of past experiments, coupled with new data, supports a \"global production\" hypothesis-that instead of exclusive formation within the ventricles, CSF is continually created and reabsorbed diffusely by cerebral capillaries that have slight variances in hydrostatic and osmotic pressure. Canine studies have documented CSF production within the ventricular system and the SAS. 2 A study of 158 dogs with focal, noninflammatory disease showed that in cases of spinal lesions, CSF was more likely to be abnormal if collected from the lumbar cistern, that is, caudal to the lesion. 12 This observation may be explained by presupposing cranial to caudal flow of CSF, but the traditionally held theory of CSF flow has recently been contested. 7 In canines, CSF collected from the cerebromedullary cistern generally has lower microprotein concentrations compared with samples collected from the lumbar cistern. 13 Blood contamination may be more pronounced in lumbar collection, as the desired subarachnoid space is more difficult to enter and yields a smaller volume of fluid that tends to flow more slowly. 9, 10 Moreover, hemodilution may contribute to increased measured protein concentration. 13 Rare instances of CSF contamination with hematopoietic precursors have only been reported from lumbar sites. 14 A low, but potentially catastrophic, risk for puncturing the cervical spinal cord or caudal brainstem exists during cerebromedullary collection. Because the spinal cord length is variable, spinal cord puncture is a possibility during lumbar collection, but it is associated with less severe adverse effects compared with injury following cisternal puncture. In a case series of four accidental cisternal parenchymal punctures (documented by using MRI), three of the four patients suffered neurological decompensation and subsequently had to be euthanized. 15 ",

Both sides of the cover-slipped hemocytometer are loaded with unstained CSF, which is then placed in a humidified container for 10 to 15 minutes to allow cells to settle on the glass. Because the fluid is unstained, the microscope condenser is lowered to improve contrast. Erythrocytes and nucleated cells are differentiated by size, refraction, granularity, and smoothness of plasma membrane. 21 Some laboratories stain CSF samples with new methylene blue (NMB), as leukocytes will take up stain, whereas erythrocytes remain unstained, making differentiation of leukocytes (specifically small lymphocytes) and erythrocytes easier (Fig. 14.1) . 22 A small volume of CSF is drawn into a capillary tube coated with NMB or a tube that has a small volume of NMB followed by an air pocket. 22 The tube containing NMB and CSF is gently rocked back and forth, allowing the cells to take up some stain without diluting the CSF with a volume of NMB. 22 The hemocytometer is then loaded, and each population is counted and totals are calculated, as follows: Neubauer chamber: (1) both areas of large nine squares are counted, and the average of the number of leukocytes and erythrocytes is found; (2) the average is multiplied by 9 to get the cells per microliter (cells/\u03bcL). 10 The ADVIA 120 (Siemens Medical Solution, Fernwald, Germany) hematology instrument has been validated for analyzing canine CSF samples and shows excellent correlation with manual methods used in dogs with increased total cell counts (pleocytosis), but the instrument may overestimate the cell count in samples without pleocytoses and has not been validated for the identification of eosinophils. 23 The automated differential count is also more accurate at higher cell numbers and thus should be compared with a traditional manual differential. The ADVIA 2120 hematology analyzer displayed satisfactory agreement with the standard hemocytometer method. 24 Validation experiments using 67 canine samples showed a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 89% for accurately identifying samples with pleocytosis when manual counting was considered the gold standard (>5 cells/\u03bcL). 24 The instrument tended to be less accurate at lower (within reference interval) nucleated cell counts. 24 Erythrocytes may be a source of interference, as a red blood cell (RBC) count of 250 cells/\u03bcL was shown to elevate the nucleated cell count. 24 With regard to differential cell count, the instrument performed better in the presence of pleocytosis, whereas monocytes were overcounted at lower nucleated cell counts. 24 Automated cell counts thus should not replace a manual differential but may be used as another level of quality control. Automated instruments cannot recognize altered cell types, such as atypical neoplastic cells.",

False-positive or false-negative reactions may occur if the dipstick reads at trace or 1+, but this method is useful if other techniques are not available. 11 Reference laboratories apply a similar but more sensitive methodology to measurement of CSF microprotein as that of serum protein, using the trichloroacetic acid method, the Ponceau S red dye-binding method, or the Coomassie brilliant blue method. 22 CSF globulin production is typically screened for with the Pandy reaction. In this test, a few drops of CSF are added to 1 mL of 10% carbolic acid solution, and the resulting turbidity is graded 0 to 4+. Any Pandy score above zero is considered elevated. Globulin concentration below 50 mg/dL will be undetectable with either test. 10, 21 Protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis may be performed on CSF and serum for maximum fractionation. 25 The utility of protein electrophoresis or immunoelectrophoresis of CSF lies in discriminating altered blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability from increased localized production of immunoglobulin, which may be suggestive of (but not specific for) a disease entity for which an electrophoretic pattern has been established.",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assays for antibody detection and PCR-based assays for nucleic acid detection of several medically important microbes have been developed for use on CSF and may be instructive in the diagnosis of viral, rickettsial, protozoal, or fungal diseases. 20 A large canine study that included a subset of 16 dogs with neoplastic or inflammatory disease showed that CSF titer provided diagnosis in 25% of cases. 3 Antibody assays should be interpreted cautiously because the presence of antibody may indicate prior exposure or vaccination rather than active infection. Moreover, compromise to the BBB in states of inflammation may translate to the presence of antibodies within the CSF without local production. Occasionally cross-reactive antibodies may be present that do not represent presence of the disease agent under assessment. Similarly, specimens for PCR should be submitted to a laboratory with strict quality control to minimize false-negative and false-positive results. Poor collection technique may result in false-positive results, especially for bacterial species that are ubiquitous in the environment. 27 As with other aspects of CSF analysis, a negative PCR result does not definitively rule out the presence of a pathogen because of the sampling limitation of a small portion of the extracellular space. 20",

Correction formulas for CSF parameters in the face of hemodilution (e.g., adding 1 nucleated cell/\u03bcL per 100 or 500 RBCs/\u03bcL) are unreliable. 45, 46 In a recent study of 106 canine CSF samples without pleocytosis (TNCC <5/\u03bcL) but containing at least 500 RBCs/\u03bcL, the mean percentage of neutrophils (45.2% versus 5.7%), percentage of samples with eosinophils present (36.8% versus 6.8%), and mean protein concentration (40 mg/dL versus 26 mg/dL) were found to be significantly increased in the samples with blood contamination when compared with controls. 47 Significant RBC contamination warrants repeat sampling, if possible. Marked hemorrhage or evidence of prior hemorrhage (erythrophagocytosis, xanthochromia, hemosiderin-laden macrophages) may be useful in the diagnosis of CNS trauma, which may be accompanied by neutrophilic to mixed cell pleocytosis and mild increase in protein concentration. 4",

Wherever possible, other categories of pleocytosis that have been reported for a disease have been mentioned. Generally, pleocytoses are defined by the cell type that comprises 70% or more of the nucleated cell population. If all cell types are 50% or less, the pleocytosis is classified as a mixed cell pleocytosis. And if, for example, lymphocytes are greater than 50% but less than 70%, some pathologists will classify the pleocytosis as mixed cell, lymphocyte predominant. A pleocytosis will be classified as eosinophilic if eosinophils compose at least 10% to 20% of the nucleated cell population. 11",

Typically, this pleocytosis is severe (could be over 1000 cells/\u03bcL), neutrophilic, and accompanied by significantly elevated protein concentration, but the cell population may change to mononuclear during the course of treatment. 10, 20, 50 Rare instances of brain abscessation secondary to sepsis (which may be a sequela of iatrogenic immunosuppression) may result in marked neutrophilic pleocytosis, markedly elevated protein concentration, visualization of bacterial organisms (see Fig. 14.8) , and abnormal MRI findings. 51 Staphylococcus intermedius was cultured from the CSF of a dog presenting with a retrobulbar abscess and neurological signs. 52 The CSF showed a moderate neutrophilic pleocytosis (75 cells/\u03bcL) and borderline elevation in protein concentration (30 mg/dL). 52 Local extension of severe otitis interna resulting in meningoencephalitis and ventriculitis in a dog has been reported. 53 This patient exhibited a severe neutrophilic pleocytosis (3672 cells/\u03bcL) and protein elevation (>400 mg/dL). 53 Pasteurella multocida meningoencephalomyelitis in a kitten was characterized by marked neutrophilic pleocytosis (981 cells/\u03bcL) with mild protein elevation (31 mg/dL) and rare extracellular and intracellular bacterial rods. 54 Bacterial culture and susceptibility testing are recommended but may yield false-negative results if organisms are not circulating in the extracellular space or if prior antibiotic therapy had been given. Serology and CSF-PCR (using organism-specific or universal bacterial [UB] PCR) are recommended. 27, 54 Cryptococcosis in dogs. Cryptococcus spp. are a large genus of systemic dimorphic fungi with a predilection for CNS tissue, which is infected hematogenously or via direct penetration of the cribriform plate. Only two species at this time are medically important: (1) Cryptococcus neoformans (var. neoformans and var. grubii) and (2) Cryptococcus gattii. In a recent study of 31 dogs with cryptococcosis, 68% had CNS infection, with neurological signs being the most common reason for presentation. 55 Dogs and cats with cryptococcosis typically have pleocytoses and elevated protein concentrations, but pleocytoses may be variably neutrophilic, eosinophilic, mononuclear, or mixed. In a recent study of 15 dogs with CNS cryptococcosis, organisms were found in 11 of 15 CSF samples (Figs. 14.9 and 14.10). 56 All affected dogs had pleocytoses that were mixed to mononuclear, whereas cats tended to have neutrophilic pleocytoses. 56 Of the samples, 11 of 12 also had increased protein concentrations (mean 494 mg/dL), which were significantly higher than in cats in the same study (mean 45 mg/ dL). 56 Capsular antigen latex agglutination testing on serum or CSF is highly sensitive and specific and is recommended if cryptococcosis is suspected but organisms are not visualized cytologically. 57 This test may yield negative results if disease is present but localized (i.e., within the respiratory tract), so appropriate clinical signs should guide testing. Culture of CSF may also be helpful and may distinguish C. neoformans from C. gattii with the use of selective media. The finding of inflammatory foci on MRI may be supportive of the presence of fungal disease; cryptococcosis may result in mass lesions, meningitis, or pseudocyst formation.",

            "text": "(FIP) has been traditionally linked to marked CSF changes, but the current literature paints a somewhat more varied picture. One study of natural FIP infection showed neutrophilic pleocytosis (as defined by >50% neutrophils) in the majority (7 of 11) of cases, with fewer cases of mononuclear (3 of 11; as defined by >80% mononuclear cells) and mixed cell (1 of 11) pleocytosis, all of variable severity. 4 Most cases (7 of 9) also had differing degrees of elevated protein concentrations. 4 Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology or suggested by elevated feline coronavirus antibody titers and reduced albumin-to-globulin ratios in both serum and body cavity effusions. 4 A slightly older study of 16 CSF samples (natural and experimental infections) showed pleocytosis in 2 of 16 cases (neutrophilic and lymphocytic) and elevated protein concentration in 4 of 16 cases. 62 In a larger study of 67 cats with FIP or non-FIP disease, incidence of pleocytosis was highest in the neurological FIP group, but 20% of these patients did not have a pleocytosis. 63 Additionally, protein concentrations were variably elevated and not statistically different in FIP compared with non-FIP neurological disease. 63 Another study of 12 cats with CNS FIP showed 8 of 12 with unspecified pleocytosis and 3 of 12 with elevated protein concentration. 64 In cats with CNS disease, sensitivity of feline coronavirus (FeCoV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) in CSF for the diagnosis of FIP was 60%, and specificity was 93%, with a positive predictive value of 75% and a negative predictive value of 87% (FIP prevalence in this population was 25.6%). 63 Definitive diagnosis of this disease remains challenging, with virus identification (PCR or immunohistochemistry) accompanied by pyogranulomatous inflammation in tissues being the gold standard. Hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated serum \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP), MRI abnormalities (typically involving the ventricular lining and meninges), and positive feline coronavirus IgG titer or PCR from serum, tissue, or CSF are supportive but not specifically diagnostic, and negative findings do not rule out disease. 20, 63, 65 Toxoplasmosis in cats. Cats are the definitive hosts for Toxoplasma gondii and may be subclinically infected; thus, diagnostics should only be performed on patients with appropriate clinical signs. Cats typically present with mild neutrophilic or mononuclear pleocytosis and normal to mildly elevated protein concentration, but marked protein elevation may occur. 4 Mild lymphocytic pleocytosis is also reported. 65 Diagnosis may be confirmed by direct visualization of organisms in CSF, aspirates of other inflammatory foci, histopathology of affected tissues, or fecal examination. Serology must be interpreted cautiously because IgG may remain elevated for up to 6 years after exposure. Therefore, paired serum IgM-IgG titers, indicating acute exposure, or documentation of rising serum IgG titers are more useful, but the latter is difficult to document in the advanced state of disease. 65, 66 Spinal epidural empyema in dogs. Epidural empyema is an uncommon disease in dogs, resulting from pyogenic infection in the epidural space. One study showed 4 of 5 dogs with neutrophilic pleocytosis of variable magnitude (11-342 cells/\u03bcL). 67 No organisms were visualized on any of the samples. 67 Except for one case with a lumbar CSF protein concentration of 726 mg/dL, protein elevations were modest. 67 Three CSF samples were cultured with no growth, and two dogs for which follow-up CSF was obtained showed resolution of pleocytosis. 67 These results are not surprising, as the dura likely provides a barrier to prevent infection extending from the epidural space to the subarachnoid space.",

Steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis (SRMA) is presumptively an immune-mediated disease of mainly young, medium-and large-breed dogs: Beagles, Boxers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Weimaraners, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are overrepresented. 20 CSF analysis is important in diagnosis and typically features a moderate to marked neutrophilic pleocytosis (a left shift may be present) and markedly elevated protein concentration. Chronically, pleocytosis may change to a more mononuclear or mixed population (Fig. 14.12 ) and may become mild or even fall into reference intervals. 72 A study of 20 affected dogs showed neutrophilic pleocytosis in 12 of 20 cases and mononuclear pleocytosis in 8 of 20 cases. 72 Concurrent elevations of serum and CSF IgA titers (elevated IgG and IgM fractions may be present), serum concentration of cross-reactive protein (CRP), or serum \u03b1 2 -macroglobulin is diagnostically supportive but not specific. 20, 50 Increases in IgA have been linked to a T-helper 2 (Th2)-dominated immune response driven by elevated interleukin-4 (IL-4) and decreased IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). 73 Serum amyloid A (SAA), serum AGP, and serum haptoglobin may also be elevated. 74 Another study of 36 dogs with SRMA reported statistically significant elevations of CSF and serum CRP, but not serum \u03b1 2 -macroglobulin, in dogs with SRMA compared with other neurological diseases. 75 In a study of 20 dogs, serum CRP was positively correlated with CSF TNCC. 72 Additionally, serum haptoglobin and serum and CSF IgA remained increased throughout successful treatment, indicating that these parameters are more useful for diagnosis than for monitoring therapy. 72 Serum and CSF concentrations of CRP and SAA have been documented to fall significantly during treatment, and repeat measurement of serum CRP or SAA may be used to guide therapy and predict relapse, which is less invasive and more sensitive than repeat CSF sampling. 72, 74, 75 Rare cases have been documented in cats with marked mononuclear or mixed pleocytosis and mild to moderate protein concentration elevations. 4",

In general, the disease process and clinical signs are similar to those in dogs, with the exception that the disease presents in cats in middle or older age, usually with cervical spinal cord signs. A case series of five cats showed CSF ranging from normal to marked neutrophilic pleocytosis with moderately elevated protein concentration and variable correlation to clinical outcome. 79 The case with the most severe CSF changes had extensive myelomalacia at necropsy. 79 It was suggested in this study that CSF is more likely to be abnormal if collected closer to the lesion and that MRI is helpful for localization and in supporting the diagnosis. 77, 79 Thiamine deficiency in cats.

It is important to perform CSF in neurology patients with suspected neoplasia, as definitive diagnosis may be achieved if neoplastic cells are directly observed via cytology. Inflammatory pleocytoses or elevated protein concentrations are common in patients with cancer, tend to be mild to moderate in magnitude, and may represent paraneoplastic inflammation, compromise of the BBB, lesional necrosis, or all of these. 28 Normal CSF is also a common finding in cases of neoplasia. Moreover, in the absence of overtly neoplastic cells, no defined patterns connect specific tumors with specific types of inflammatory pleocytoses. Neutrophilic pleocytosis of unspecified magnitude was found in the CSF of 2 of 11 cats with spinal lymphoma and in 3 of 7 cats with nonlymphoma spinal neoplasia (astrocytoma or osteosarcoma). 81 Additionally, the remaining four cats with nonlymphoma spinal tumors (meningioma, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, plasma cell tumor) had either normal CSF or ACD of unspecified magnitude. 81 Metastatic tumors to the CNS should also be considered in a patient with neurological signs.",

The size of lymphocytes and morphological atypia may be helpful, although these may be challenging to differentiate from artifactual morphological changes secondary to cytospin preparation. Cats with neoplasia may have lymphocytic pleocytoses (suggestive of lymphoma), mild to moderate mononuclear to mixed cell pleocytoses (suggestive of nonlymphoma tumors), or normal CSF. One study examined six cases of feline CNS or multifocal lymphoma, which displayed pleocytoses of variable magnitude, absent to mildly elevated protein concentrations, and neoplastic cells visualized in 5 of 6 of the CSF samples. 4 In this study, eight cats with CNS signs that were ultimately diagnosed with nonlymphoma tumors (e.g., meningioma, carcinoma, nerve sheath tumor) had mild CSF protein elevations and either normal TNCC (1 of 8) or mild to moderate mononuclear or mixed cell pleocytosis (7 of 8). 4 Another study of 11 cats with spinal lymphoma showed neoplastic cells visualized in one case and hemodilution, ACD, or neutrophilic pleocytosis in the remainder of cases. 81 A case report of feline multiple myeloma involving lumbar vertebrae and associated soft tissues exhibited cisternal CSF with an elevated protein concentration of 290 mg/dL and mild pleocytosis (8 cells/\u03bcL) consisting of a majority of neoplastic plasma cells. 111 Diagnosis was further confirmed by abnormal urine protein electrophoresis and bone marrow aspiration. 111 Histiocytic malignancies. Malignant histiocytosis or histiocytic sarcoma tumor cells in canine CSF have been documented in two recent case reports; CSF cytology displayed marked mononuclear pleocytoses (>500 cells/\u03bcL) and mild to moderately elevated protein concentrations (<135 mg/dL). 112, 113 Tumor cells phenotypically resembled macrophages, displayed multiple criteria of malignancy, and reacted positively to CD1c on immunocytochemistry, compatible with interstitial dendritic cell origin. 112, 113 Necropsy was confirmatory and found no evidence of neoplasia outside of the CNS. 112, 113 A case report of a gliomatosis cerebri (GC) neoplasm in a middle-aged poodle showed CSF with a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (20 cells/\u03bcL) and protein concentration elevation. 114 On histopathology, lymphocytelike perivascular cuffing and meningitis were noted.

For the remaining 10% of cases, cytological interpretation did not correlate with final diagnosis. 123 Cytological interpretation of CNS lesions may be very difficult, and biopsy with histopathological examination is recommended to confirm all diagnoses. It is important for cytological samples to be prepared in the same manner each time to avoid introducing additional cytological variations that the pathologist has to read through. Some authors recommend wet-fixation of tissues followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). 122 At the authors' institution, CNS cytological samples are air-dried and stained with Diff-Quik or a modified Wright stain. The reader is referred elsewhere for a complete discussion of normal CNS cytology. 124 Clinical imaging findings, and signalment, should be considered carefully and may help the pathologist to formulate a list of potential differential diagnoses. It must be kept in mind that primary tumors may metastasize to the CNS, and these should be included in the differential diagnoses, where appropriate.",
