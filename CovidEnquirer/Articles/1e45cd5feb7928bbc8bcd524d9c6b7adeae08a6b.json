In this study, all of the patients without basic kidney disease showed no obvious abnormality of renal function during the hospitalization of COVID-19, and none of the patients exhibited ARF. Be cause high homology of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The results of this study were similar and consistent with the presentation of renal function injury in SARS. In this study, we also observed that the patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and confirmed as COVID-19. Except regular CRRT, the monitoring of renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF during the course of treatment of COVID-19. The re-examination of CT showed that pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. Unlike a formidably high mortality in SARS complicated with renal impairment, none of the patients died from the aggravation of CRF or from COVID-19 itself caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. It was also suggested that CRRT plays an important role in the treatment of COVID-19 complicated with CRF.",

At present, none of the patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). In addition, the patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were still undergoing regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) except for the treatment of COVID-19. During the course of treatment, the monitoring of renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and re-examination of CT showed that pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed.Detection results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sedimentSARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments of COVID-19-confirmed 53 patients, including 5 CRF cases, enrolled in this study was examined by real-time RT-PCR.
