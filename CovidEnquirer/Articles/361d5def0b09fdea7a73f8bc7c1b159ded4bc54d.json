            "text": "Previous studies have suggested that kennelled dogs are more likely to test positive for CECoV than household pets. Here we describe both cross sectional and longitudinal studies in two rescue kennels and two boarding kennels, together with molecular diagnostics, to provide a new insight into the epidemiology of CECoV. Prevalence of CECoV in the cross sectional studies tended to be higher in the rescue kennels (13.8% and 33.3%) than the boarding kennels (5.3% and 13.5%). In each kennel, type I CECoV was more prevalent than type 2 CECoV. The mean quantity of type I detected was equivalent to 6.3 \u00c2 10 8 gc/gm (range = 5 \u00c2 10 6 , 8.5 \u00c2 10 11 ), compared to 1.3 \u00c2 10 8 gc/gm (range = 3 \u00c2 10 6 , 2.4 \u00c2 10 10 ) for type II. In one rescue shelter where dogs were followed longitudinally, infection was significantly associated with accommodation block as well as the length of stay (increased risk of CECoV per week in residence of \u00c21.9). Of those animals sampled on two or more occasions, none tested positive on arrival, and 54.5% later shed CECoV, suggesting that infection may have been acquired within the kennel. Shedding patterns and sequence analysis suggested both types I and II CECoV were maintained in this population by a combination of introductions into the shelter and within-shelter transmission. The findings suggest that some kennel environments may be important in maintaining CECoV infection in the population. We also propose that the diversity of viruses like CECoV in these populations may provide a novel surrogate marker for the success of biosecurity.",

Field infections are typically associated with mild and self-limiting diarrhoea, (Binn et al., 1974; Pratelli, 2005) , although there are also reports of more severe haemorrhagic disease with high mortality (Buonavoglia et al., 2006; Evermann et al., 2005; Tennant et al., 1993) , sometimes in combination with other pathogens (Evermann et al., 1980; Pratelli et al., 2001 Pratelli et al., , 1999b . Both mild and severe disease have been recreated experimentally (Decaro et al., , 2010a , suggesting the more severe disease phenotype may be associated with the genetic evolution of more virulent strains Evermann et al., 2005) . Although CECoV infection is generally considered to be short-lived, occasionally virus shedding has been detected for weeks to months (Decaro et al., 2005; Pratelli et al., 2002; Tennant et al., 1991) . The epidemiological significance of these long-term shedders is unknown.",

The strains are named in this way due to their respective homologies to types I and II feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Decaro et al., 2010a; Herrewegh et al., 1998) . Genotype II has recently been subdivided into CECoV IIa and CECoV IIb, with the latter thought to have formed via a recombination with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Decaro et al., 2009 (Decaro et al., , 2010b . There is conflicting evidence on the relative prevalence of CECoV I and II, with some studies suggesting type I is more common (Decaro et al., 2005; Stavisky et al., 2010) , and others suggesting type II Soma et al., 2011) , but these findings will depend on a number of factors including the nature of the sample population. Dual infection with both types has been reported to occur, both naturally and experimentally (Decaro et al., , 2005 Soma et al., 2011) . There is some evidence to show that type I may be shed at a greater titre than type II CECoV (Decaro et al., , 2005 Soma et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Overall prevalence estimates of CECoV vary substantially, and are complicated by a number of factors including the different detection methods used (electron microscopy, virus isolation, RT-PCR), whether both types of CECoV are being considered, the clinical status of the animals and the characteristics of the sample population. In general, CECoV prevalence is lowest in healthy pet dogs, ranging from 0% to 17.5% (Schulz et al., 2008; Tennant et al., 1993) , and somewhat greater in pet dogs with diarrhoea, ranging from 7.9% to 66.3% (Godsall et al., 2010; Soma et al., 2011) . CECoV shedding is also common in dogs in rescue kennels, with a reported prevalence of 43-59% and 73% in non-diarrhoeic dogs and diarrhoeic dogs, respectively (Sokolow et al., 2005; Tennant et al., 1993) . In contrast, no CECoV was isolated from 26 dogs sampled in a boarding kennel (Tennant et al., 1993) . Sporadic outbreaks of CECoV-related disease in kennels has led to the suggestion that dogs living in these environments may be more susceptible to CECoV (Benetka et al., 2006; Binn et al., 1974; Ntafis et al., 2010; Tennant et al., 1993) .",

The three kennel blocks at R1 each had a distinct intended function. On entry, dogs were usually housed in block 1 (92 kennels) for at least 7 days, and could remain there for the duration of their stay. Block 2 (20 kennels) was used for those dogs deemed by staff to be the most easily re-homed. A dog normally only entered block 2 after its 7-day holding period (a statutory requirement for any stray dog). A small number of dogs which were healthy and had been relinquished by their owners rather than admitted as strays were housed from entry in block 2. Block 3 (32 kennels) was used as a quarantine facility, most frequently for dogs exhibiting signs of upper respiratory tract disease, and also for bitches in season. Most dogs were housed singly, with the exception of bonded pairs relinquished together. Dogs in blocks 1 and 2 were put in individual runs in daytime, whereas dogs in block 3 sometimes shared the use of the outdoor runs, at staff discretion.",

Such environments may be important for maintaining this infection in the general population. In this study, we have for the first time used Table 3 Results of real-time RT-PCR on faecal samples from kennel R1. Blank = not sampled; 0 = CECoV negative; I = positive for just CECoV I; II = positive for just CECoV II; M = mixed type I and II CECoV. \u2044 Indicates the two individuals further detailed in Fig. 1. N = both cross sectional and longitudinal study designs, together with molecular diagnostics, to provide a unique insight into the epidemiology of this coronavirus in high density, high turnover populations of kennelled dogs. The prevalence of CECoV in the four kennels ranged from 5% to 33%, with type I being both more common. The prevalence in newly housed animals was relatively low, in line with that reported previously in the general dog population Tennant et al., 1993) . During housing, both length of stay and kennel block were significantly associated with infection risk. Shedding patterns and sequence analysis in one of the shelters strongly suggested the viruses were maintained in this population by a combination of introductions into the shelter and within-shelter transmission. This is important, since CECoV may be associated with diarrhoea, and it has been shown that animals with diarrhoea or ill-health have either a delay in being rehomed (Litster et al., 2011) , or a greater chance of being returned to the shelter (Wells and Hepper, 1999) . As well as its significance to the health of the animals, such studies also provide a marker that other diseases may be readily transmitted in such environments. Although the way in which such kennels operate makes detailed epidemiological study difficult, our study design allowed us to identify some within-kennel risk factors for infection. Longitudinal sampling clearly showed the risk of infection increased with the length of stay in kennel R1, from 3.7% within the first week of entry to 80% after 8 weeks or more. This suggests some exposure to cumulative risk factors (for example infectious burden of CECoV, concurrent infections, stress) likely impact on infection risk. This is similar to studies in feline rescue shelters with the related feline enteric coronavirus, where the prevalence of infection rose from 33% on relinquishment to 60% within one week, with all adults cats that tested positive on both occasions showing a rise in viral titre of 10 1 -10 6 (Pedersen et al., 2004) . In our study most animals tested negative on arrival, and for the three animals that did test positive on arrival, repeat samples were not available so whether there was a similar rise in titre could not be assessed.",

Husbandry factors specific to this block may at least in part explain this risk, since dogs were sometimes mixed in outdoor runs or put into runs which had not been cleaned of faeces and urine from other dogs. This was not common practice in blocks 1 and 2 and, therefore, enhanced opportunity for transmission in the dogs in block 3 may partially explain the different infection rates. Respiratory infection was the most common reason for moving a dog to block 3, and immunocompromise, from concurrent ill-health, may have led to an increased susceptibility to CECoV infection. However, other unmeasured factors could also have contributed to this difference in risk between the three blocks. Using sequence analysis, we showed several dogs contemporaneously housed in this block all shedding the same virus, providing strong evidence for within-kennel transmission. Data such as this, where a risk factor is clearly linked to accommodation, can allow limited resources to be efficiently targeted to those areas where disease transmission is most problematic.",

Such strain complexity suggests that new strains of CECoV are regularly introduced into this shelter, presumably with those occasional new residents that are shedding CECoV on admission. The observed strain complexity present within these high density, high turnover populations is clearly a balance between the introduction of new distinct strains in new animals, and the transmission of strains within the colony. The level of strain diversity within these populations can, therefore, provide an objective assessment of the biosecurity in such high density populations, identify practices that could be improved (Beersma et al., 2009; Coyne et al., 2007; Radford et al., 2001) , and enable the effectiveness of interventions to be monitored. The use of boarding and rescue kennels in our study provided an opportunity to contrast the natural history of CECoV in different environments. The overall prevalence of CECoV appeared higher in the two rescue kennels (13.8% and 33.3%) than the boarding kennels (5.3% and 13.5%), consistent with the pattern seen in previous studies using virus isolation (which only detects type II CECoV), where prevalence rates of 23-86% and 0% were seen in rescue and boarding kennels, respectively (Tennant et al., 1993) . Numerous reasons could underlie the variations in prevalence shown. The boarding kennels mainly housed owned dogs for relatively short periods. We have shown time is a risk factor for CECoV faecal shedding and many may leave the kennel before they can become infected and/or start shedding.

            "text": "In our study, the prevalence of type I CECoV was consistently higher than that of type II, with all four kennels shedding type I, whereas only two kennels shedding type II. There is some uncertainty about which type of CECoV is most prevalent in the population, and most recently it has been suggested that the significance of each type may be different in different countries . In this latter study, only eight samples were available from the UK, one of which tested positive for CECoV II. These authors commented that their findings may be compromised by the low number of samples available from the UK. Our findings reported here are consistent with our previous work (Stavisky et al., , 2011 , which together suggest type I CECoV may be the predominant variant in the UK. The samples here underwent PCR and sequencing in fragments of the variable S gene and conserved M gene in order to allow detection of recombination. No recombination was detected in this study; however sequencing was not successful in both regions for all samples, possibly due to some of the samples being of lower titre. The regions selected, whilst useful in determining transmission patterns and potential recombination events, did not allow differentiation of the CECoV type IIa and IIb (TGEV-like) strains. These 'TGEV-like' strains have been previously recognised in the UK and elsewhere (Decaro et al., 2009 (Decaro et al., , 2010b Erles and Brownlie, 2009 ) and it has been suggested that they may show an enhanced ability to spread systemically, as compared with other strains (Ntafis et al., 2011) . In future work it would be to useful to examine both the prevalence of these subtypes in rescue and other kennel populations, and their transmission characteristics.",

            "text": "In these naturally infected dogs, shedding occurred for a variable period. In some dogs, CECoV was only detected on a single sampling occasion, whilst others shed for 4-5 weeks. In these dogs, sequentially sequenced samples proved to be genetically identical, suggesting that these dogs were true chronic shedders, rather than undergoing cycles of re-infection with different viral strains. Similar periods of more long-term shedding have also been reported following natural (Tennant et al., 1991) and experimental (Decaro et al., 2005) CECoV infection, and similar patterns of shedding have also been described for the related feline coronavirus (Addie et al., 2003) . Interestingly in our study, both of the animals that shed virus for the longest tested negative on arrival, suggesting they were newly infected within the shelter or were undergoing some stress induced recrudescence. Evidence for the former comes from sequence analysis which clearly identified identical viruses already in the shelter when these two carrier animals arrived. Although further work is needed to understand the mechanism of coronavirus persistence, clearly such long term shedders are likely to play an important part in the ongoing epidemiology of infection.",

For those dogs which shed CECoV for several weeks during the sampling period, peak titres were seen at different points of the infectious period. Therefore, the observed variability of the titres we detected may depend in part on when in the infectious cycle a dog was sampled. There may also be a component of both the immunity of the dog, and the virulence of the strain involved. The mean type I titre detected was slightly higher than type II; this difference was not significantly different, but the same tendency has been observed previously (Decaro et al., 2005) . The titres obtained must be considered as semi-quantitative rather than fully quantitative when used as a measure of viral shedding since both the consistency of the faeces and other factors will affect the amount of virus shed.",

The study design used may help identify interventions to manage both between-and within-kennel risk factors for transmission such as biosecurity and stress, particularly in populations of dogs with uncertain health status, and high density and turnover.",
