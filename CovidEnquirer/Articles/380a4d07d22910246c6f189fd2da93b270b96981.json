At the molecular level, redox regulation can directly modify the active sites of enzymes, although a growing number of examples indicate the importance of an additional underlying mechanism that involves conditionally disordered proteins. These proteins alter their functional behavior by undergoing a disorder-to-order transition in response to changing redox conditions. However, the extent to which this mechanism is used in various proteomes is currently unknown. Here, we use a recently developed sequence-based prediction tool incorporated into the IUPred2A web server to estimate redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions on a large scale. We show that redox-sensitive conditional disorder is fairly widespread in various proteomes and that its presence strongly correlates with the expansion of specific domains in multicellular organisms that largely rely on extra stability provided by disulfide bonds or zinc ion binding. The analyses of yeast redox proteomes and human disease data further underlie the significance of this phenomenon in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes, as well as its biomedical importance.",

For example, enzymes typically need to adopt a welldefined conformation that ensures the correct orientation of their active site residues, as required for optimal catalytic activity. In contrast, intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDPs/IDRs) lack a well-defined structure in isolation, and are best characterized by an ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformations [1] . The specific structural properties of IDPs enable them to carry out a different set of functions, which could not be fulfilled by relatively rigid globular domains [2, 3] . As a result, the function of many IDPs directly originates from their high intrinsic flexibility, enabling them to act as linkers or spacers [3, 4] . However, there is an emerging understanding that the structural behaviour of IDPs is often context-dependent: a disorder-to-order or order-to-disorder transition can be induced as a result of binding to specific macromolecular partners, undergoing post-translational modifications, or changes in environmental factors such as pH and temperature [5] . Recently, redox conditions have emerged as another important factor that can regulate conditional disorder [6] . The growing number of examples of redox-regulated conditionally disordered proteins indicates that this is an important mechanism triggered in response to various forms of oxidative stress or to naturally occurring changes in redox potential [6, 7] .",

ROS may be generated exogenously or endogenously due to metabolic activity or inflammation, while subsequent oxidative damage can cause widespread protein unfolding and aggregation. It may also contribute to the pathogenesis of many different diseases, as well as to degenerative processes associated with aging. However, ROS can also serve as cellular signaling molecules and regulate various biological processes such as the immune response, cell proliferation, development, and more [8, 9] . The specific effects of ROS are captured in large part through the covalent and reversible modifications of specific cysteine residues, which can in turn modify the structural or functional properties of the redox-sensitive target proteins. Such post-translational modifications are tightly regulated by changes in levels of diverse physiological oxidants and is generally faster than expression of specific regulatory proteins. Over the last decade, numerous examples of such thiol-switch proteins have been uncovered, spanning different functions and regulation modes [6, 7, 10] . The functions of select proteins were found to be regulated by oxidative modifications of a specific cysteine thiol forming either sulfenic (e.g., in 1-Cys peroxiredoxin) or sulfenamide (e.g., in tyrosine phosphatase 1B, leading to regulation of the Ras signaling pathway). Another more studied mode of activation is through disulfide bond formation by redox-sensitive cysteine residues, typically located in close proximity of each other. These disulfide bridges can either promote disorder-to-order transitions (e.g., chloroplast regulator of the calvin cycle, CP12 [11] and cell growth modulator, granulin Grn-3 [12] ) or vice versa (e.g., in the bacterial protein chaperone Hsp33 [13] and mammalian copper chaperone Cox17 [14] ) in response to shifts in the cellular redox status [6] .",

These methods usually involve a differential modification of the thiol groups by specific probes which labell reduced thiolate groups. Since the oxidized cysteines do not interact with these probes, the typical workflow involves an initial modification of all reduced thiols in the cell proteome, followed by reduction and then labeling with the second probe which differs in mass from the first. Thus, reduced and oxidized cysteines can be differentially labeled in a ratiometric manner, allowing for quantitative analysis of reversible oxidation modification of thiol groups. One of these approaches is based on the differential labeling by N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) and N- (6- (biotinamido)hexyl)-3\u2032(2\u2032-pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP), which enables the analysis mainly of the reversibly oxidized thiols [15] . In contrast, the OxICAT methodology is based on differential labeling of reduced and oxidized cysteines with isotopically light and heavy forms of the isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagent, derivatives of the iodoacetamide alkylation reagent [16] . The usage of two differential isotopes provides quantification of the degree of oxidation among thousands of specific cysteine residues within the analyzed proteome in a highly precise manner. OxICAT has thus far been applied to proteomes (redoxomes) of diverse organisms under different physiological conditions [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

            "text": "Using redox proteomics studies, the cellular redox state has thus far been revealed to either directly or indirectly affect a wide range of physiological processes in the cell. However, proteomics studies provide no information about the underlying mechanisms of thiol modifications, nor to what degree the detected thiol modifications correspond to redox-regulated conditional disorder. In order to explore this aspect of redox regulation, we took advantage of a recently introduced new feature of the IUPred method (IUPred2A) that enables the sequence based prediction of regions that are likely to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon redox changes [21] . IUPred is a robust sequence-based prediction method for protein disorder that uses an energy estimation method [22] . The strength of the method originates from its ability to capture the basic biophysical properties of disordered segments: their inability to form enough stabilizing interactions to adopt a well-defined globular structure. The core of the method is a statistical potential that assigns more favorable scores to amino acid pairs that are observed more frequently in the proximity of each other within the structure of globular proteins, as compared to a background model. In this regard, cysteine residues clearly stand out, as they often form covalent contacts with other cysteines, thus providing large stabilizing contributions either by forming disulfide bridges or coordinating Zn 2+ and other metal ions. Consequently, the cysteine residues have a strong order promoting character in IUPred. However, thiol modifications of either paired or single cysteine residues may lead to a reversible order-todisorder transformation, exposing unfolded regions crucial for protein function [6, 7] . This regulatory effect of redox conditions on protein structure not only follows the presence of oxidation sensitive cysteine residues, but is also influenced by the presence of disorderpromoting residues in the surrounding sequence. In such cases, cysteine residues may simply be considered small, polar residues akin to serine, located within a sequence region exhibiting distinct features. The prediction of redox-sensitive disordered regions is based on capturing this dual characteristics of cysteines. This novel method opens new doors to explore redox-sensitive conditionally disordered segments in various proteomes.",

For this reason, rigorous benchmarking on a large number of positive and negative data is not possible for the prediction of redox-sensitive structural transitions. Instead, IUPred2A was established and is further customized in this study, to best describe the available experimentally verified examples. The prediction is based on the generation of two prediction profiles, one using the original amino acid sequence (redox_plus, assuming cysteine stabilization) and one with mutating each cysteine to serine (redox_minus, corresponding to the lack of cysteine stabilization). While the prediction scores would differ for any sequences containing cysteines, in most cases, no changes in the overall order-disorder tendency would be observed. Our hypothesis was that in the cases of sequences that undergo disorder-to-order transition upon changes in redox conditions, a pronounced shift could be observed with the redox_plus profile predicted as ordered, and the redox_minus profile predicted as disordered. Redox-sensitive regions involved in this type of transition are predicted based on the observed divergence of the two profiles (See Data and Methods).",

However, substrate binding is inaccessible in this conformation and consequently, the protein lacks chaperone activity [13] . Oxidative unfolding (oxidation coupled with mild protein destabilization conditions) causes the C-terminal region to release the Zn 2+ ions, inducing the unfolding of the C-terminal domain together with the adjacent linker region. This transition exposes the substrate binding sites that makes the protein active [28, 29] . The critical region for redox-sensing is located between resides 230 and 266, which contains the four highly conserved cysteine residues that coordinate the Zn 2+ ion under reducing conditions, but form short-range disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions. The large part of the experimentally determined redox-sensitive region is correctly identified by IUPred2A ( Figure 1 ) [30, 31] .",

These interactions are critical for T cell development and activation. The interacting tail regions of both CD4 and Lck were shown to be intrinsically disordered in isolation, yet assemble to a form a zinc clasp structure [34] . Interestingly, the interaction is also regulated at the level of alternative splicing [35] . The interaction prevents the internalization and degradation of CD4 by masking the dileucine motif required for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis [34] . While there is no direct evidence for redox regulation of this complex, activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells is associated with the intracellular increase of reactive oxygen species and release of zinc [36] .

Bacteria feature the lowest fredox values, with over 90% of species having fredox<7%. In general, for unicellular organisms, fredox is below 10%, including almost all archaea and bacteria, together with some eukaryotes. In contrast, multicellular organisms are characterized by markedly higher fredox values, with some highly complex organisms reaching close to 30%. The steady increase of fredox with the increase of complexity is demonstrated by the comparison of the S. cerevisiae (fredox=7.2%), D. melanogaster (fredox=19.6%) and human proteomes (fredox=27.2%).

Both T. congolense and P. falciparum (the major causes of the sleeping sickness and malaria, respectively) are unicellular eukaryotes, and such their fredox values are expected to be below 10%, similarly to other organisms with comparable complexity and small proteome size. However, their fredox values rather resemble those of their hosts, with fredox=24.4% and 17.9%, respectively ( Figure 3A ). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/412692 doi: bioRxiv preprint While the fraction of proteins incorporating redox-sensitive intrinsically disordered regions increases with organism complexity, the typical length of such regions is strikingly constant across various domains of life and viruses ( Figure 3B ). The typical region length is approximately 22 residues, and while eukaryotes have a slightly higher average region length, this is primarily a result of the high apparent length of tandem arrays of redox-sensing regions. This indicates that the basic molecular mechanisms behind redox-sensing structural switches are probably uniform across all life, and the emergence of complexity requires a larger number of proteins utilizing such mechanisms.",

In the yeast proteome, nearly all redox-sensitive structural switches are metal ion coordinating domains. The majority of these domains coordinate zinc ions, belonging to a handful of zinc finger domain types ( Figure 3D ). The transition into the realm of multicellular organisms brings about a drastic increase in the relative number of structural switches harboring zinc ion coordinating structural switches. While the ratio of proteome sizes for yeast vs. drosophila is only 2.3 (6,049 vs. 13,775), the ratio of the number of identified metal ion coordinating domains is about 4.5. Analysis of the drosophila proteome also demonstrates the emerging dominance of C2H2-type zinc fingers. In addition, the drosophila proteome also shows a striking increase in the number of disulfide-bound structural switches. In contrast to metal ion binding domains, however, the identified disulfide bonded domains are more evenly distributed across several types of domains. Considering the human proteome, the abundance of both types of structural switches are even higher. However, this increase is more pronounced for the metal ion binding domains, and is largely attributable to the drastic increase in the number of C2H2 type zinc finger domains. In comparison, extracellular, disulfide bonded domains remain fairly diversified across several domain types.",

As these predictions suggest a specific mechanism underlying the redox-sensitivity, we took a closer look at these examples (Table 1 ). In one example, the GAS1 protein is anchored to the plasma membrane and to the cell wall. In addition to the catalytic glucanosyltransferase domain, it also contains a cysteine rich domain. The redox-sensitivity of these cysteines in not easy to explain, as they are required for the normal folding and stability of the protein [41] . An interesting case corresponds to YDJ1, a yeast homolog of the chaperone DnaJ, a zinc containing co-chaperone, involved in mitochondrial protein import. The central cysteine-rich domain, which contains four repeats of the motif CXXCXGXG, is predicted as conditionally disordered. Its redox-sensitivity suggests that it could be involved in oxidative-stress response, similarly to Hsp33. The validity of the prediction is supported by the notion that redox regulation was established for the human homologue of DnaJ [42] .",

Additional members of the translation machinery are also candidates for redox-regulated conditional disorder mediated by their Zn 2+ binding domains, such as Taf1 and Elf1. Taf1 is a zinc knuckle that plays a central role in TFIID promoter binding and regulation of transcription initiation [44] . Elf1 is a conserved transcription elongation factor that contains a putative zinc binding domain with four conserved cysteines [45] . Another Zn 2+ binding protein, Gis2 interacts with the mRNA translation machinery and is a component of the stress induced RNP granules [46] . NRP1 also belongs to the group of Zn 2+ finger proteins, with a currently uncharacterized RNA binding function, also localizing to stress granules. From a functional point of view, the redox-sensitivity of these proteins can play a critical role in the global attenuation of translation in response to oxidative stress [40] .

EGFlike domains are commonly found in tandem repeats in the ligand binding regions of receptors, and are often targeted by germline mutations. Cys-altering mutations in the EGF domains of fibrillin, the major structural constituent of extracellular microfibrils [52, 53] results in connective tissue disorders such as the Marfan syndrome. The perturbation results in short or long-range structural rearrangements, and can affect the Ca 2+ binding ability of the domain, which can lead to increased susceptibility to proteolysis, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, and delayed secretion [52] . It has been suggested that increased oxidative stress can contribute to disease progression [54] . A radically different phenotype is produced by EGF Cys mutations of CRB1, linked to various retinal dystrophies. CRB1 has an important role in maintaining retinal integrity, and its mutations result in ROS accumulation and photoreceptor cell death [55] . Similar mutations in NOTCH3 cause the vascular dementia disease Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). In this case, however, mutations lead to impaired intracellular trafficking and maturation of the mutated Notch 3 receptors [56] , and are not directly related to oxidative stress [57] . In NOTCH3, the uneven number of cysteines likely contributes to intermolecular disulfide bridges, as these mutations increase multimerization and aggregate formation [58] .",

LDL-receptor domains are responsible for ligand binding, and EGF-like domains are involved in the degradation and recycling of the receptor. Both types of structural modules are common sites for Cys altering mutations, causing familial hypercholesterolemia [59] . Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A) does not contain EGF-like domains, but its extracellular region is composed of four repeats of the TNFR domain, each stabilized by three disulfide bonds. TNRF can harbor Cys-abolishing mutations, disrupting highly conserved intrachain disulfide bonds, leading to the autoimmune disease periodic syndrome phenotypes.

In the light of our knowledge of redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions located in this compartment, COA6 provides an interesting case as regards disease mutations. The protein is involved in the maturation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, and is critical for biogenesis of mtDNA-encoded COX2. A pathogenic mutation in COA6, leading to substitution of a conserved tryptophan for a cysteine residue, results in a loss of complex IV activity and cardiomyopathy. Towards understanding the molecular basis of pathogenesis, it was recently shown that the human COA6 (p.W59C) mutant leads to an increased aggregation state or mislocalization to the mitochondrial matrix [65, 66] . In agreement with these observations, the observed mutations introduce a redox-sensitive region, which is not predicted in the native protein sequence.",

The majority of such mutations perturb the Zn 2+ ion binding of various types of zinc finger (ZNF) domains, and in these cases the mutations almost ubiquitously eliminate cysteines. As one of the most common function of ZNF domains is DNA binding, several cysteine-modifying germline mutations affect transcription factors. One of the most well studied such protein is the human zinc-finger transcription factor WT1. WT1 ZNF cysteine mutations result in abnormal development of the genitourinary system and are associated with various diseases including Wilms tumors, Denys-Drash syndrome, Nephrotic syndrome 4 and Meacham syndrome. The four C-terminal tandem ZNFs of WT1 [67] are mutational hotspots, with the majority of the contained mutations altering the zinc coordinating cysteine residues of ZF2 and ZF3 domains. These mutations can increase the flexibility of the protein or alter its DNA-binding specificity [68] . While there is no direct evidence that WT1 is redox-regulated, in the case of the similar protein EGR1 it was shown that the redox state modules the DNA binding activity of the protein [69, 70] . Another transcription factor, PHF6 is involved in chromatin regulation and neural development [71] . Germline mutations connected to the X-linked mental retardation disorder B\u00f6rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome eliminate the conserved C45, C99 and C305 cysteines in either the C2HC or the PHD-type zinc finger. These mutations affect the structure core or zinc coordination of the PHF6-ePHD2 domain and destabilize the correct protein fold and consequently interfere with the normal biological function the protein [71] . Apart from direct DNA binding, ZNF targeting mutations can affect transcription in a more indirect way. C1430R and C1471Y mutations in KMT2D likely disrupt the PHD5 finger fold, and reduce histone binding and catalytic activity of the protein [72] , leading to Kabuki syndrome.",

Mutations in Parkin (PARK2), a ubiquitin ligase, are one of the predominant hereditary factors underlying some forms of Parkinson disease. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a major contributing factor to the disease [73] . At the protein level, a large fraction of the observed loss-of-function mutations in the hereditary form of the disease destabilize the protein by affecting folding and stability of the complicated Zn 2+ -bound architecture [74, 75] , leading to impaired degradation of target proteins, such as ZNF746 and BCL2 [76] [76, 77] . Other proteins with redox-sensitive cysteine mutations include FHL1 and LMX1B, both containing multiple LIM domains, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions as opposed to DNA-binding. LIM domains are generally 50-60 amino acids in size and share two characteristic zinc fingers, which are separated by two amino acids [78, 79] . LIM domain containing proteins have diverse biological functions, often shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, potentially even in in a redoxregulated manner [80] , acting as adaptors or scaffolds to support the assembly of multimeric protein complexes, and can also contribute to the regulation of the localization [78] . Specifically, LMX1B controls the expression of key genes involved in mitochondrial functions [81] . The FHL1 gene is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle and its mutations are causative for several types of hereditary myopathies. The Cys mutations are likely to significantly affect the structure and the folding of the proteins and have been shown to induce the formation of aggresome-like inclusions [82] .",

            "text": "Cells constantly encounter changes in oxidative conditions which could be a source of signaling information or can evoke significant stress for the organisms. In order to adequately respond, cells have developed various mechanisms that potentially affect a wide range of physiological processes. Many of these responses are centered around the unique chemical and physical properties of cysteine [83] . Due to its tunable reactivity, cysteine residues are exploited in several different types of proteins including enzymes, signaling proteins, chaperones, and others for regulating their activity. A wide repertoire of potential reversible post-translational modifications of thiol groups enables diverse modes of functional regulation and response to a wide spectrum of physiological oxidants and conditions. Another important property of this residue is its high affinity for metal binding and ability to form disulfide bonds, which provide important additional stabilization for different types of protein structures. As the various functions are often dependent on oxidative conditions, cysteine residues can serve as redox-regulated cellular switches modulating the biological activity of various proteins. It has been demonstrated in the case of a growing number of examples the such thiol switches may trigger conformational changes in proteins, and undergo a disorder-to-order (or order-to-disorder) transition upon changes in cellular redox conditions. Unfortunately, a discovery of such thiol switches encoded in conditionally disordered proteins in the large-scale level is challenging and time-consuming. Therefore, a bioinformatic tool which points to the potential redox-regulated intrinsically disordered region can significantly speed up a discovery of such important regions in a proteome level, pointing on potentially interesting targets for the further biochemical characterization. Here, we have developed and applied such a tool implemented in the IUPred2A web server [21] to uncover potential redox-regulated conditionally disordered protein regions at the proteome level. This opens up a way to assess the functional link between redoxregulated processes and the structural dynamics of the proteins involved.",

            "text": "One of the main outcomes of the presented study is that redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions (RSCDRs) are widespread in various proteomes, especially in eukaryotic multicellular organisms. According to our predictions, around 5% of the proteome corresponds to proteins with RSCDRs in yeast, however, this proportion increases to nearly 30% in the human proteome. This highly unexpected result gains more credence with the domain-level analysis that established a strong correlation between the increased amount of RSCDRs and the expansion of potentially redox-sensitive domains, such as intracellular zinc fingers or the extracellular EGF domains, at various points of evolution. In yeast, the most common domains predicted to be redox-regulated through conditional disorder are various types of zinc fingers including the DNAJ_C family, or certain subunits of the ribosome. We have used our bioinformatic tool to identify potentially conditionally disordered regions associated with known peroxide-sensitive cysteines in yeast, and identified 15 potentially interesting proteins harboring the RSCDRs (Table 1 ). This subset of proteins includes ribosomal proteins, a mitochondrial cochaperone, YDJ1, and transcriptional regulators TAF1, ELF and RDS3. This analysis supports a very-well established interplay between protein and redox homeostasis in cells (29351842), revealing potential members of the protein homeostasis system that might employ redoxregulated conformational changes to regulate their function during oxidative stress. These predictions might direct further experimental analysis of a crosstalk between redox regulation, structural changes, and proteostasis related function. Interestingly, proteins with the predicted redox-regulated disordered regions are predominant in drosophila species. This increase can be partially attributed to the expansion of the zinc finger families. However, novel domains also appear such as the zinc binding LIM domains, some of which were shown to change their intracellular location upon redox regulation. The functional importance of these domains is further underlined by their involvement in various diseases that alter cysteine residues with a critical role in this type of regulation. Moreover, another large group of predicted RSCDPs corresponds to extracellular domains found only in multicellular organisms. The redox regulation of extracellular proteins could be important for their transfer to the extracellular matrix, and assembly in their target location. Thus, mutations of such critical, redox-regulated cysteine residues can lead to devastating diseases ( Table 2) . Coupling of potentially redox-sensitive thiols and structural plasticity is very well characterized in proteins transferred from cytosol to other organelles, such as mitochondria and peroxisome. Thus, the similar mechanism might be crucial for the biogenesis of extracellular proteins, including receptors. In addition to biogenesis, receptors could utilize redox-regulated regions for sensing changes in redox status and mediate related signaling events [60] [62, 63] . Our results suggest that the human and drosophila proteomes share many common redox-sensitive structural switching domains, corresponding to similar functions. However, the abundance of these domains is further elevated in Homo sapiens, with the most drastic increase observed in the case of the C2H2 type zinc finger domains.",

            "text": "Altogether, these results reinforce the importance of redox regulation in key biological processes. However, the analysis of human genetic variation also highlights that mutation of cysteine residues critical for such regulation are correlated with different pathologies (Table 2 ). This analysis shows that such disease-related mutations are found in proteins with different functions and different cellular localization. It is tempting to speculate, that some of these proteins might be involved in sensing or maintaining redox homeostasis in the related organelles. However, the understanding of the structural mechanisms underlying the development of these diseases have already served with potential therapeutic options. CADASIL commonly arises via NOTCH3 cysteine mutations, and artificially introduced exonskipping removes the affected EGF-like domains, and can restore receptor functionality in vitro [90] . The large scale identification of similar redox-sensitive protein regions, together with pathway/mutation analysis can serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention. In addition to endogenous modulations leading to diseases, RSCDPs and redox regulation play critical roles in host-pathogen interactions as well. The role of redox-sensitive proteins in interactions between viruses and eukaryotic hosts is known for several examples, such as Hepatitis C virus [91] , coxsackievirus B3 [92] and Epstein-Barr virus [93] . Viruses, in general, exploit the redoxstate dependence of several signaling pathways of the host cell, and this has even been recognized as having therapeutic value [94] . Our results suggest that the use of redox-state dependent proteins can be a generic theme among viruses targeting multicellular hosts. Redox-state modulation is an emerging theme in the host-pathogen interactions of single-cell eukaryotic pathogens, such as trypanosoma, leishmania, malaria and others. Parasite survival and its successful proliferation depends on the capacity of the invading parasite to cope with the oxidation blast of the host immune system. Therefore an effective redox regulation mechanism is a crucial component for parasite survival which is found and characterized for many unicellular pathogens, including T. congolense and P. falciparum. Our analysis suggests that these pathogens contain significantly large fractions of proteins with redox-sensitive intrinsically disordered regions ( Figure 3A ). Further analysis of these proteins might have therapeutic advances. In order to choose potential candidates for experimental analysis, our method can be coupled with the recently developed experimental tools, which enable real-time mapping of redox states in the parasite [95] .",

We generate two prediction profiles with the default settings of the IUPred method, one for the native sequence corresponding to the state achieved through cysteine stabilization (redox-plus) and one calculated for a modified sequence with cysteines residues mutated to serine, corresponding to the state without cysteine stabilization (redox-minus). To initiate a redoxsensitive conditionally disordered region, the difference between the two profiles has to be larger than 0.3, while the minus profile is below 0.5 and the plus profile is above this threshold at a given position. This region is then extended until the difference between the two profiles becomes lower than 0.15, or the redox plus profile falls below 0.35. Two adjacent regions are combined if they are closer than 10 amino acids. Two minor modifications were introduced compared to the original web server implementation, aimed at decreasing potential overprediction of such regions. First, a predicted redox-sensitive conditionally disordered region must have at least 3 residues that meets the opening criterion. Second, the minimal length of the predicted region must be at least 15 residues. The current version of the program is available at: http://gerdos.web.elte.hu/data/iupred_redox_2.0.tar.gz",

Only those biological process terms were considered that are attached to at least one protein with at least one predicted redox-sensitive structural switch. In order to enable the analysis of fairly generic and high level processes, only those terms were kept which are reachable from the root term (biological_process) with at most four steps following only 'is a' or 'part of' relations. These terms were further filtered for ancestry, and if two terms were in ancestor/child relationship, only the child term was kept. The resulting set of GO terms were manually split into four groups based on the level of biological process they describe. This yielded the GO molecular slim, containing 61 terms describing basic molecular processes; the GO network slim, containing 77 terms describing pathway/network level processes; GO cell slim, with 103 terms describing cellular processes; and GO organism slim, with 183 terms describing organism level biological processes. The enrichment of each term among redox-sensitive conditionally disordered proteins was assessed comparing the occurrence of the term in the RSCDP set and the human proteome. 1,000 sets of 5,488 proteins were taken from the human proteome randomly, and were evaluated for term occurrences, yielding an average and standard error for expected occurrence. The enrichment of each term in RSCDP is expressed as the difference between the observed and expected occurrences in standard error deviations. The supplementary material shows the enrichment values for all terms in all four slims.",

Mutations located within redox-sensitive conditionally disordered regions were filtered out based on an overlap with predicted regions using the original sequence in cases when a cysteine residue was altered, or using the mutated sequence in case the mutation introduced a cysteine. The identified mutations are shown in the supplementary material. To concentrate on cases that are likely to be directly associated with alteration of a redox-regulated conditionally disordered region, proteins were sorted according to the ratio of mutations within predicted regions versus all mutations within the corresponding gene.",
