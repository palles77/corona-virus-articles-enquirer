We sought to determine the frequency of hMPV in adults hospitalized due to exacerbations of COPD.",

Nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained at the discretion of the clinician caring for the patient and transported to the laboratory in MicroTest M4-RT medium (Remel, Lenexa, KS) within 1 h. Specimens obtained overnight were held at 4 C for up to 8 h. Otherwise, specimens were processed by the laboratory on receipt. hMPV testing was performed using a reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction assay (RTePCR) with primers specific for the hMPV F gene as previously described. 11 RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza-1, -2 and -3 and adenovirus were identified by a cytospin-enhanced direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA). 13 Nasopharyngeal specimens required a minimum of 25 columnar epithelial cells to be adequate for DFA testing. Viral cultures were performed, if requested by the clinician, using primary rhesus monkey kidney, A549 and MRC-5 cell cultures, according to published methods. 13 These techniques are unable to identify either rhinovirus or coronaviruses. Patients were excluded from the analysis if a nasopharyngeal specimen was unavailable, not obtained within the first 5 days of hospitalization or inadequate for DFA testing. Medical records were reviewed to obtain information regarding the patients' clinical course of their acute illness and past medical history. If a patient was hospitalized more than once for an acute exacerbation of COPD during the study period, only the first acute exacerbation hospitalization was included since the duration of hMPV shedding has not been well described.",

It remains unknown whether temporal and/or geographic differences in the circulation of hMPV may have led to the differences in these findings. This study was performed during the winter and early spring when hMPV is typically detected. 9e11 The incidence of both RSV and influenza A also typically peak during the winter and are on the decline by early spring in North America. Thus, the frequency of exacerbations associated with hMPV, RSV and influenza were likely to be greatest during the study period and were found similar to rates observed by other investigators. 5, 6, 19 We were unable to successfully determine if patients had or had not received influenza vaccination during the 2002e2003 season. It remains unclear whether hMPV significantly affects patients with COPD during other seasons in temperate climates. We did not identify any specific demographic or clinical characteristic that distinguishes hMPV from non-hMPV acute exacerbations of COPD, however, our study was of limited power to identify such characteristics.",

In our laboratory, cytospin enhanced DFA has been shown to have a sensitivity similar to conventional cell culture for the identification of influenza, parainfluenza and RSV, and is comparable to real-time RTePCR for the detection of influenza A. 13, 22 The hMPV infections observed in our patients likely represented re-infection since it has been shown that most persons are seropositive for hMPV by 5e10 years of age. 7, 23 As with RSV and parainfluenza, the duration and degree of protective immunity may wane with time. It has been shown that hMPV isolates segregate into two distinct genotypes by phylogenetic analysis. 10, 11, 16 Therefore, it is possible that infection with one hMPV genotype may not confer complete protective immunity against other hMPV strains. Previous reports have described patients infected with genetically distinct hMPV strains during sequential years, however, this issue remains unresolved. 16,24e26 It has been suggested that co-infection of hMPV and RSV may potentially explain some of the variance in the severity of RSV illness in children and that hMPV co-infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 27e29 In our study, we did not identify any patients with an exacerbation of COPD co-infected with RSV and hMPV despite focusing on patients with severe illness resulting in hospitalization.",

Concern has been raised regarding the duration of viral nucleic acid carriage and hence the specificity of PCR based diagnostic testing in patients with COPD. 30 However, hMPV is only rarely identified in patients lacking signs or symptoms of an acute respiratory illnesses. Williams, et al. identified hMPV in only 1 (1.2%) of 86 children without evidence for a respiratory tract infection. 10 Furthermore, the recent study by Beckham et al. failed to identify any hMPV infections in a group of COPD patients who experienced an acute respiratory illness. 18 This suggests that the identification of hMPV from a patient experiencing an exacerbation of COPD more likely represents the etiology for the exacerbation rather than an unrelated epiphenomena.",
