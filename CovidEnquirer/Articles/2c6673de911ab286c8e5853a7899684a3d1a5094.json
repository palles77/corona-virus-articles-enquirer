            "text": "Eric Vinson, DO Bioterrorism represents a threat for which most emergency departments (EDs) are ill prepared. In order to develop an evidence-based plan for ED and hospital management of contaminated patients, a review was conducted of the most effective strategies developed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, as well as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and military guidelines on biowarfare. Six basic steps were identified: 1) lock down the hospital and control access to the ED; 2) protect emergency care personnel with appropriate personal protective equipment; 3) decontaminate and triage patients; 4) isolate patients; 5) treat patients with appropriate medications or measures, including decontamination of wounds; and 6) use restrictive admission and transfer guidelines. By emphasizing these six basic concepts, a rural ED passed an annual state-run bioterrorism mass-casualty drill. The drill provided health care personnel with the knowledge and skills necessary to prepare for future bioterrorism casualties. These same concepts could also be used to manage highly virulent viral or bacterial outbreaks.",

After the September 11th terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, the US government formed the Department of Homeland Security. In an effort to assess the extent of hospital bioterrorism preparedness, the US General Accountability Office (GAO) surveyed 2041 hospitals. 1 The results disclosed an incomplete level of preparedness. While the majority of hospitals had provided bioterrorism classes to their employees; less than half had conducted drills simulating a bioterrorism incident. Hospitals reported that they would not have the equipment, specifically ventilators and isolation rooms, to manage these types of mass casualties. No standard emergency department (ED) protocols existed for conducting a medical response to a bioterrorism incident.",

In Taiwan, 100 hospitals were surveyed regarding their response to SARS. 4 These surveys revealed many attempts at patient management, the most successful of which resulted in good outcomes as measured by low rates of hospital and staff infection. The largest contributor to staff infection rates was a delay in acknowledging the infectious disease emergency. 4 In Taiwan, several hospitals delayed calling the SARS epidemic a disaster. This was because of concerns that implementing strict infection-control protocols would decrease the other hospital services and incite panic. The EDs that implemented disaster infection control procedures early in the outbreak reported that fewer than 9% of their employees had a fever and had to stay home. This was compared to 47% of employees of hospitals who delayed in calling the epidemic. 4 In both Taiwan and Toronto, hospital administration restricted access by limiting the number of entranceways. 9 Several hospitals used existing lockdown procedures, such as those used for riots or fires, and involved announcing a disaster code over the PA system and coordination with security personnel.",

During the SARS epidemic, the Toronto and Taiwan EDs used mostly level D working PPE: eye protection, gloves, gown, and N95 masks. 9 Biowarfare victims need to be carefully managed from the point of the event through hospital admission. Prehospital protocols based on the CDC guidelines for contaminated or infectious individuals are taught to most emergency medical system first responders; thus, a discussion of the prehospital response is not addressed here. 1 Although many hospital plans are predicated on the notion that contaminated individuals will be decontaminated prior to transport, most studies show that patients will not be decontaminated on site and transported. 8 Therefore, patients must be grossly decontaminated before entering a medical facility; a decontamination tent or isolated shower may be used.",

Definitive laboratory testing will be limited to specialized facilities. Therefore, a working diagnosis should be made based on clusters of symptoms (i.e., pulmonary complaints can be caused by tularemia, plague, or anthrax). Since our scenario presumed anthrax exposure, ciprofloxacin was used as the Food and Drug Administrationeapproved drug of choice for anthrax exposure and treatment. Doxycycline (200 mg intravenous (IV) load, followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours) was used for pregnant patients, children, and individuals allergic to ciprofloxacin. Weight-based dosing of doxycycline was available for children less than 12 years of age. 3 Anthrax prophylaxis involves the use of ciprofloxacin for 4 weeks until receiving 4 doses of the anthrax vaccine. The vaccine is handled by the CDC and should be started immediately. Oral doxycycline (100 mg twice a day) or amoxicillin (500 mg every 8 hours) were acceptable alternatives for pregnant females or appropriate weight-based dosing for children less than 12 years of age. 3 Treatment guidelines for other potential bioagents are available in numerous references. 2 In Taiwan and Toronto, lack of beds led to restrictive admission and transfer behaviors. In Toronto, transfers were discouraged, as certain hospitals became designated SARS centers. Conversely, Taiwanese tertiary medical centers received multiple transfers from outlying rural EDs. These rural EDs subsequently limited their contamination rate by transferring potentially infectious patients once their own bed capacity was reached. Lack of isolation rooms became the key reason for transferring patients out and restricting the admissions. 4",
