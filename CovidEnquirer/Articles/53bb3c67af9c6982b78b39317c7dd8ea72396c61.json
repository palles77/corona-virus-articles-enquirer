In the present study 205 tracheal swabs and organs were collected from broilers and layers chicken farms during January to August 2012 from 19 governorates all over Egypt. The chickens demonstrated respiratory signs and mortality. Out of the examined samples, 130 of which (about 64%) of suspected farms were positive for IBV with real time RT-PCR. 13 IBV-positive samples were selected for further isolation and characterization. Isolation in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryos was carried out after studies three blind successive passages and the hypervariable region of spike protein1 (SP1) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to study the genetic diversity between the isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences of 13 isolates compared with other IBV strains from the Middle East and worldwide reveled that 11 out of the 13 isolates had close relationship the Israeli variants (IS/885 and IS/1494/06) with nucleotide homology reached up to 89.9% and 82.3%, respectively. Only two isolates had close relationship with CR/88121 and 4/91 viruses with identities of 95% and 96%, respectively. This study indicates existence of two variant groups of IBV circulating in Egypt during 2012. Group I was Abbreviations: IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; SP, spike; HVR, hypervariable region; RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. * Corresponding author.

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens. This disease is characterized by respiratory signs and in young chickens severe respiratory distress commonly occurs while in layers it causes decrease in egg production [1] . Until recently, the chicken was considered the only natural host of IBV and in which the virus cause disease. Pheasants are the other avian species that is now considered as a second natural host for IBV [2] . The disease is transmitted by the air-borne route, direct chicken to chicken contact and indirectly through mechanical spread [3] . The IB virus is a member of the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, Order Nidovirales. IBV and other avian coronaviruses of turkeys and pheasants are classified as group 3 coronaviruses, with mammalian coronaviruses comprising groups 1, 2 and 4. Group 4 is the more recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [4] . IBV is an envelope; positive sense single stranded RNA virus containing an un segmented genome approximately 27.6 kb in size. The virion has four structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M) small envelope protein (E), and glycosylation spike glycoprotein (SP) [5] .",
