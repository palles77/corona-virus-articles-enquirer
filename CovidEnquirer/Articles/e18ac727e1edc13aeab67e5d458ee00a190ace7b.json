In the early 1990's, international public health and medical care organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO), were trying to figure out how to reasonably allocate limited public health and medical care resources. Against this backdrop, voices were raised to find a new methodology to calculate the health level of population groups. 1,2",

Therefore, efforts have been made since the early 2000s to calculate Korea's burden of disease with our own data sources. In the initial period, most of the Korean burden of disease studies were usually focusing on a single disease such as stroke or mental illness. 5, 6 A 2002 study on the burden of disease of Korean people was the first of its kind in Korea and the most recent burden of disease study is based on data from 2012. 7, 8 However, because research methodology improved in the period between these two studies, they did not use the same methodology, and the lists of diseases measured were also different from each other. Therefore, it is impossible to make a direct comparison between those studies in terms of changes of burden of disease.",

In order to prevent the overestimation of incidence and prevalence when using the claims data, for each disease we extracted the number of times hospitalization occurred and the number of visits to outpatient clinics (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , based on advice from experts and literature reviews. In particular, to calculate the number of incidence cases, we applied a washout period, defined as from at least 1 year to a maximum of 5 years.",

In the case of DW, one should be cautious to apply DW as calculated in one country to another country because there can be some differences in sociocultural perspectives of disease. Consequently, this study calculated DALYs by applying a DW that was calculated to be applied in Korea. 10 To calculate mortality, we assumed mortality by age, gender, and disease using the 2007-2015 cause of death data from the Statistics Korea, and in doing so, we applied the garbage coderedistribution method for the causes that could not be the cause of death. 11",

These trends seem to have contributed to the drastic increase in YLDs. the elderly in 2008. 21 In order to benefit from the long-term care insurance for the elderly, patients were screened for early stage Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and so the disease burden was rapidly increased. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias show a rapid growth in disease burden, but there is a lack of evidence to support effective interventions to reduce them.

In the 2010 GBD study, the methodology used to calculate DALYs was changed from the incidence-based approach to the prevalencebased approach. Therefore, it is not appropriate to directly compare the DALYs calculated in the GBD study and the DALYs calculated in this study. 23 This study calculated DALYs by applying the incidence-based approach, while the GBD study applied the prevalencebased approach. The incidence-based approach is a method of estimating the loss of health caused by death and disability occurring after the onset of disease and the prevalencebased approach is a method of calculating the loss of health of patients in a given year. The advantage of the incidence-based approach is that it is possible to figure out how much loss of health would arise if a disease or injury occurs, but it is hard to consider the people currently living with the disease. That is, it has limitations in calculating the current burden of disease if the disease has a high prevalence but its incidence is on the decrease. In contrast, with the prevalence-based approach, it is hard to predict how much burden of disease would arise if a disease occurs, but it has the advantage that it is appropriate to calculate the current burden of disease caused by a certain disease. 23 It is hard to say which approach is superior, but it seems that calculating DALYs under the prevalence-based approach was developed as a method to overcome the limitations of collecting input parameters that should be collected in every country to calculate the GBD. On the other hand, as more than 97% of the total population in Korea have health insurance or are entitled to medical care assistance, we can see most of the medical service usage data through the National Health Insurance claims data, and it is also easier to calculate incidence of a disease as it is possible to structure the cohort format data with the personal identification code. 24 For this reason, this study applied the incidence-based approach to calculate DALYs.",

From the 2015 Korean burden of disease rankings presented in the GBD study, migraine was ranked seventh out of all diseases but was not even included among the top 30 diseases in this study. Generally, migraine is not considered a disease that requires treatment, but it is usually recognized as a symptom that occurs due to stress or lack of sleep. As we intended to set the prevalence criteria of migraine by considering it as a disease in this study, we defined the people with disease as those who visited the outpatient clinic for three times or more for one year with migraine as main diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision; code, G43). Under such definition, migraine was classified as a disease with low prevalence in this study. In the GBD study, however, epidemiological indicators that were derived through self-administered survey were used. 25 -27 For this reason, migraine was observed as having high prevalence, and therefore, DALYs calculated by using it was very high. 24 As a result, the GBD study results have connotations that the DALYs of the diseases for which self-medication is possible without using medical services, such as headache and gastrointestinal disorder, can be overestimated, while it can be underestimated in the results of this study.",

First, it did not calculate the burden of disease of new types of communicable disease such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, which spread widely across the globe in 2015. Therefore, it is needed to calculate the burden of disease by including diseases that realistically reflect the circumstances of Korea. Another limitation is the methodological limitation related to the calculation of the duration of each disease. This study used DISMOD-2 for diseases and injuries other than communicable diseases. 28 However, the estimated duration of chronic disease with long duration, such as diabetes mellitus, calculated shorter than generally known. Duration of disease can vary depending on the public health care environment and the level of development of each nation, but DISMOD-2 does not properly reflect such variations. Therefore, in order to reflect the circumstances of Korea, further research needs to be conducted in the future regarding the methodology needed to derive the duration of diseases. In addition, this study failed to consider the issue of underestimation arising out of excluding the unmet demands for medical services among those who do not use medical services as it only used the data of medical service users. In Korea, however, it is assumed that the size of burden of disease arising out of the failure to consider the unmet demands for medical services is not that large because almost every person is covered by the National Health Insurance. Nonetheless, more consideration needs to be given to the issue of how to reflect the not-used medical services and the unmet demands for medical services in calculating the burden of disease.",

Moreover, the number of visits to medical institutions per person steadily increased from 11.63 days in 2000 to 16.58 days in 2007 and 19.61 days in 2015. 17 As 62% of Korean people have medical insurance for actual expenses as of 2016, resistance against medical expenses has fallen, leading to an increase in the use of medical services. 18 In other words, enhanced access to medical services and lower resistance against medical expenses led to the increase in the use of medical services, and as a result, incidence and prevalence rose. It seems to be for this reason that YLDs, which are calculated based on such indicators, have increased.On the other hand, it was observed that YLLs gradually decreased. Improvements in medical technology and increased life expectancy seem to have reduced the burden caused by premature death. In particular, the decrease in deaths from injuries made a significant contribution. Injuries caused by motorized vehicles with three or more wheels fell by 33.9% since 2007, while injuries caused to pedestrians by road vehicles decreased by 30.2%. In the case of self-harm, which comprises the largest portion of YLLs, it rose until 2011 and showed a decreasing trend afterward. In 2015, the YLLs for self-harm fell by 20% compared to the figures from 2011. Rates of self-harm in Korea are the highest among OECD member countries. A variety of policies have been established to prevent deaths from self-harm. Among them, the government-wide \"comprehensive countermeasure for the prevention of suicide\" was established in 2007, and the \"Act on the Prevention of Suicide\" was enacted. However, further research is needed regarding whether the burden of disease caused by selfharm actually decreased or not. This is because while the rates of self-harm caused mortality decreased, the number of suicide attempts, as collected through the National Emergency Department Information System, is still on the rise. 19 In the YLDs for self-harm calculated in this study, we only included the cases where people were admitted to hospitals or higherlevel medical institutions after making a suicide attempt. Those who used outpatient clinics or visited clinic-level medical institutions were excluded. Such criteria were applied not only to self-harm but also to injuries. Therefore, there are chances that the YLDs of injuries was underestimated. In this regard, it is necessary to calculate the burden of injuries more accurately by reinforcing data sources.Among the burden of disease in Korea in 2015, low back pain made up the largest share, and it rose by 88.5% compared to 2007. The burden of disease due to low back pain shows an increasing trend also at the global level. In addition, the increasing trend is explicitly observed in high-income countries, particularly high-income Asia-Pacific countries. 20 In Korea, it was calculated that the burden of disease due to low back pain was higher for women than for men. The burden of disease was particularly high among women in their 30s to 50s and it seems to be caused by environmental characteristics including child-rearing and household chores for which women have the main responsibility, as well as physiological changes such as pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and aging.From the trend analysis results of burden of disease for the 2007-2015 period, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias displayed the largest increase. Compared to 2007, the burden of disease in 2015 had increased by 283.8%. It seems that such a huge increase was caused by the increasing number of incidence cases of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias due to the rapid aging of the population and the downward trend of the age at which patients are diagnosed with those diseases. As it costs more and more to treat and care for patients with geriatric diseases including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and related social expenses rise, the Korean government introduced the long-term care insurance system for",
