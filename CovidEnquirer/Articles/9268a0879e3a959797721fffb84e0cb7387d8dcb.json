Through a cross comparison, authors are able to explain the differences by the contextualism theory which could be traced back to the fundamental divergence on lifestyles, preferences, urban morphology besides climatic variations. The discussion is derived from a study of three green rating systems representing international, national and local systems with reference to intentions, mechanisms and benchmarks to facilitate objective assessments. For the case of Hong Kong, local challenges are identified and compared with counterparts at a national level. Two residential projects having certified by the 'modified, localized' national system is selected for a case study for synopsis with a view to explain the cause and effect of transferability versus non-transferability of assessment credits and protocols. Introducing and applying national and international systems to a local context can detect flaws in local design practices that may be ignored in the local rating system.",

Aiming to identify priorities for sustainable design, to frame environmental information, and to create a body of information about the impacts of buildings on the environment, the green building assessment systems are a type of indicators revealing key characteristics of important subsystems and elements of concern. As shown in Fig. 1 , the green building rating systems usually cover from global environmental impacts to indoor impacts (Burnett, 2007) . In recent years, these systems are expanding to assess neighborhoods, communities and cities (Sharifi & Murayama, 2013) . Understanding the green building rating systems is of great importance for urban planning and design (Retzlaff, 2008) . Buildings are an important part of the sustainable development and their environmental, economic and social impacts on cities are obvious. Although the environmental concern in urban planning is being given increasing attention, it remains secondary to economic and social priorities. Green building assessment systems rank environmental performance relative to typical practices, design codes, planning and engineering standards. Thus these rating systems can provide evidence for planning or policy system to judge the sustainability of buildings and to reduce the chance of arbitrary decisions (Yudelson, 2008) .",

Since then, there had been a rapid increase in the number of methods throughout the world and a corresponding increase in research on building assessment systems. Some renown assessment methods or tools are U.S. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Hong Kong Building Environmental Assessment Method Plus (BEAM Plus, formally known as HK-BEAM), Japan Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE), and China Green Building Label (GBL). The existence of the wide variety of building assessment systems provides evidence that no single system has emerged as the green building industry standard in the world (Cole, 2006) . Benefits may come from the existence of so many different systems; for instance, multiple systems in practice in the same country can act as a driver for innovation. However, they might also confuse the market by sending mixed messages, and they require design professionals to be familiarized with multiple assessment methods. Furthermore, duplication and overlap among various systems and a lack of transparency and implicit assumptions can make choosing among the various systems difficult and costly (Cole, 2006) .",

Early adaptation of building assessment systems to local and regional conditions was addressed in 1998 at the Green Building Challenge Conference (Cole, 1999) . Several considerations for adaptation were proposed, for example, assessing building energy consumptions relative to standard local codes and usage and rewarding higher levels of performance on water or materials in specific regions where these resources are lacking or unavailable. A tendency of re-developing green building rating systems was seeking more opportunities for locally developed weighting especially in those developing countries where advanced building assessment tools were absent. For example, a hypothesis-based study has been conducted using LEED as a reference, to measure green performance of Qatari buildings in accordance to the current needs of Qatar and its future plan (Ibrahim, 2012) . BREEAM, LEED and CASBEE were considered as a starting point for the development of an effective environmental assessment method intended for the establishment of environmental assessment method suited to Saudi Arabia (Alyami & Rezgui, 2012) .",

They also provide access to third-party reviewers so localities do not need to review and certify the green achievements. Adaptation of international and national building assessment systems to local contexts, therefore, is a cost-effective way for cities or regions to implement green building programs if they do not have developed a system, or to underpin current green building policies if the market is accommodating for co-existence of different systems.",

            "text": "For Hong Kong, the main green building rating system is BEAM Plus (formally known as HK-BEAM). From 1996 to 2012, nearly 200 projects are registered or certified by BEAM (www.beamsociety. org.hk/). However, the market is quite free and open for any international or national green labels. From 2008 to 2012, LEED certified 17 projects and trained nearly 590 LEED Accredited Professional or Green Associate in Hong Kong (http://www.usgbc.org/ LEED/). From 2011 to 2013, China GBL certified 6 projects and trained 101 green managers in Hong Kong (www.cngb.org.cn/). Meanwhile, other green labels such as Singapore Green Mark and UK BREEAM have certified some projects in Hong Kong. In this article, LEED, GBL, BEAM Plus are compared to respectively represent international, national and local labels for Hong Kong. The three systems all have controlling or prerequisite credits that should be first completed before a building is to be evaluated, general or regular credits that are optional for classifying green buildings into different levels, as well as premium or optimum credits for additional credits. Table 1 compares scoring and ranking systems for the most recent versions of the three labels. A shown in Fig. 2 , these systems share a similar coverage mentioned in Fig. 1 . However, these categories are weighed differently according to their priorities and these credits are technically different. LEED highlights public transport and low emitting vehicles, and energy and water reductions. In U.S., 28.1% of total carbon emissions come from the transportation (USGBC, 2009). Huge private car ownership and low density highlight the significance of public transport to designing a green building. However, this is less significant in Hong Kong (Hui and Yu, 2013) where over 90% of the daily journeys are on public transport, making it the highest rate in the world (Lam, 2003) .While in Hong Kong, public health and ventilation attract more attention since SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) (Wong et al., 2009) . Correspondingly, BEAM Plus underscores an efficient and healthy building for users. In China, green building development is deeply related to national policies such as the \"eleventh five-year plan\" which advocated a society of \"saving\". Thereby, \"saving\" is the key word of the China green building label: saving land, energy, material and water. In sum, the three systems share similar categories that embody universal consensus on a green building. However, under each category, they have different credits to reflect regionalities and intentions.",

The three systems have different quantitative requirements for these aspects. For example, in the aspect of connectivity to basic services, LEED requires 10 services within 805 m; GBL requires 8 within 500 m; BEAM Plus requires 10 within 500 m. The difference is due to different basic population distribution and density conditions in these areas.",

For example, LEED requires 20% water reduction; GBL and BEAM Plus require 10%. LEED has a more stringent threshold for the water reduction rate. Efficient landscaping by using adaptive plants or rainwater for irrigation is a significant part for water saving strategies in these tools. The three tools identify different baselines for calculation of water consumptions. For example, LEED sets 6 L per flush for toilets; while the default values in GBL and BEAM Plus are 6.6 L per flush and 7.5 L per flush, respectively. The variance reflects different industry practices in these areas. For the category of \"Energy\", the three systems have two basic aspects: building energy efficiency and renewable energy use. However, the three systems base energy efficiency on different standards. For example, LEED uses ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards; GBL uses national standards for different climates in China (such as Hot-summer and Cold-winter, Hot-summer and Warm-winter, and Severe Cold and Cold); BEAM Plus uses ASHRAE standards as well as a local standards such as Performance-based Building Energy Code from EMSD (Electrical and Mechanical Services Department). These standards or codes similarly use a baseline to compare proposed design. However, their baselines are quite different, and the credit scales are varying amongst the three rating systems. Through an energy modeling comparison of two office buildings in Shanghai, it is found that the yearly energy saving of the proposed design was approximately 27% from GBL system and 21% from LEED (Pan, Yin, & Huang, 2008) . Another comparison study of energy performance requirements across LEED, BREEAM, BEAM Plus, GBL, etc. confirmed that LEED was more stringent in terms of default parameters in comparison with the other systems (Lee, 2012) . However, no matter how sophisticated these energy performance ratings, they may be unlikely to reveal actual performance in uses (Gou, Prasad, & Lau, 2014) . Therefore, the results should be carefully explained.",

The aim of this discussion was to find out how to address these challenges in the checklist and credit-endorsing system. Delphi methodology was used to instruct this discussion. The Delphi method is a consensus-building tool to promote and encourage involvement from all stakeholders during the evaluation framing process (Dalkey & Helmer, 1963) . A Delphi study aims to engage a large number of experts and stakeholders in a process of coming to agreement without necessitating their leaving their usual domain. The Delphi method was frequently used in making environmental assessment frameworks or selecting indicators. There were three rounds of discussion. In the first round, different opinions and suggestions on the questions were collected. These opinions and suggestions were categorized into several key solutions for the revision. The most frequently mentioned solutions for the raised questions referred to adjusting credit types (prerequisite, general, and optimum credits), combining local and national standards, and raising or lowering the thresholds to different extents. In the second round, the panel members voted for their preferred solutions in more quantitative ways and explained the reasons. In the third round, the solutions with the highest votes were sent out for final agreements. The discussion lasted for one week. Table 3 summarizes some important revisions and adaptations based on the Delphi focused-group discussion. Most revisions is fine-tuning of the GBL requirements using counterparts in the BEAM Plus as a reference. For example, in the credit for outdoor wind speed, GBL mainly concerns the upper limit of the wind speed (5 m/s) for pedestrian comfort; while BEAM Plus is concerned with the lower limit of the wind speed (1.5 m/s) for ventilation. The revision combines them to form a wind speed range (1.5 m/se5 m/ s) for a comfortable zone which takes into account both the need for ventilation in high-dense environments as well as the control of wind amplification that refers to the high wind speed at pedestrian level caused by high-rises.",

In the first step, the project stakeholders consisting of the architects, engineers, developers, and other consultants conducted a preliminary selfcertification to find out how to revisit their design schemes to pursue maximum scores. After carefully revisiting the design scheme and preparing supporting documents, a workshop was held by China Green Building Council to go through the design schemes credit by credit. Finally, the credits and their supporting documents (Table 5) were approved by the Council. Both of the two projects were awarded the three-star design label, the highest level in GBL. However, as shown in Table 5 , neither of the two projects satisfied the credit for sunlight and daylight access, the credit for The certification uncovered that the sunlight access was unachievable in Hong Kong. According to the national standard GB 50180, there must be at least 3 h of sunlight in the lower floors of a building in Big Chill Day when the daily average temperature is the lowest according to Lunar Calendar. In the two projects, only higher floors could access sunlight. The 3-h sunlight could hardly be met for the lower floors in the high-rise environment. Deficiency of thermal performance of the building envelope showed another cultural difference. Thermal performance of the building envelope is an essential design factor for energy saving in residential buildings. Thermal performance mainly refers to window-wall ratio, heat-transfer coefficient, sunlight shield coefficient etc. Neither of the two projects met the standard. Because there is no energy efficiency requirement for residential buildings in Hong Kong, thermal performance is largely ignored in local residential design practices.",

For land saving in residential developments, one prerequisite requires that the maximum of land usage for high-rises should be 15 m 2 per capita. The land use per capita for Case1 was 2.67 m 2 and it was 3.93 m 2 for Case2, much lower than the cap in GBL. The requirement is too loose for high dense cities where land per capita is quite low. For community connectivity, GBL proposes that there should be 8 public service facilities like education, medical care and hygiene, banking, post service and so on within 500 m of the residential development. Case1 had 21 services and Case2 had 26 services within their 500miter radius. Encouraging non-traditional water use is an important strategy to save potable water use. For Case1, the percentage of non-traditional water use was more than 42%, much higher than the optimal requirement 5%. This is because seawater as a kind of non-traditional water is popularly used in flushing in Hong Kong. According to Water Supplies Department, seawater is used to flush toilets in 79% households in Hong Kong. Obviously, these green features are commonplace in Hong Kong. What's the significance of awarding these green features? If the rating system aims to push the building sector for more sustainable, how to further raise the thresholds for these credits?",

This article identifies and confirms natural and man-made challenges in high-dense urban environments for applying alternative green building rating systems. The application of a national system into a local context does lead to some interesting conclusions. For example, the thermal performance of residential buildings in Hong Kong can hardly meet the national code. Thermal performance of a building's envelope has a key role in reducing energy load and sustaining indoor thermal comfort, which is largely ignored in the local building codes and green building rating system. Applying national and international green building rating systems can disclose the deficiency of local design practices and design codes.",
