Many families adopting internationally travel to their child's birth country at least once before bringing their new family member home. Most commonly, families are traveling to the republics of the former Soviet Union, China, Guatemala, or other developing countries in Asia, Central or South America, or Africa. Family members who travel and family and close contacts of the child who remain at home all need information about protecting themselves during travel and preventing acquisition of diseases that could be transmitted by the internationally adopted child after arrival in the United States.",

Although the application to adopt internationally usually requires at least 1 or 2 years of preparation, families may be notified about travel within 2 to 3 weeks of departure. Adoptive families may not have a choice in their travel destination or itinerary, the time of travel, or accommodations during the trip. They may not speak the local language or have regular 0031 access to interpreters and may be apprehensive about accommodations, visa requirements, and overseas procedures. They may be inexperienced firsttime parents or may be traveling with other children who require attention to their own needs. Travel for adoption may lead to prolonged and unexpected stays in the country, possibly with accommodation in nontourist facilities, such as local apartments, hostels, or their child's orphanage. Because of a desire to please the many individuals with power over the adoption process (eg, facilitators, interpreters, court and government officials, agency and orphanage personnel), families may accept risks they would ordinarily avoid, such as eating local foods or drinking potentially unsafe water, drinking more or different types of alcohol, seeking medical care in rural health facilities, or using local means of transport without seat belts or car seats. Families may be exposed to extreme air pollution, farm animals, second-hand cigarette smoke, or infectious agents, such as tuberculosis, that they might otherwise avoid were it not for the adoption process.",

Many sources of pretravel advice are available (Table 1) [1] [2] [3] . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) make their recommendations available in print or on line (www.cdc.gov/ travel) [4] . Adoptive families may also receive information from agencies, travel agents, airlines, and embassies; it is prudent for families to verify any information about possible outbreaks or other local situations with reliable and authoritative sources such as the CDC or World Health Organization (WHO). For example, a measles outbreak in a Chinese orphanage led the CDC to suspend adoptions from the affected orphanage temporarily [5] . During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the CDC provided up-to-date information and released travel advisories that were instrumental in informing families and adoption agencies about the status of the epidemic. Although the SARS outbreak resulted in suspension of adoptions from several countries, disruption of plans of many adoptive families, and household isolation of some newly adopted children, no cases were reported in internationally adopted children.",

Hepatitis A vaccine is highly effective, and a two-dose schedule [11, 12] . Typhoid vaccine should be considered for travel to many of these countries, because this disease is also contracted by exposure to contaminated food and water [4] . Protection afforded by typhoid vaccines is incomplete, however, and all travelers to countries where a risk of contracting diseases associated with contaminated food and water is present should be counseled about appropriate dietary precautions. These include drinking only boiled or safe drinking water (chlorinated water, bottled water from a reliable source, or carbonated water), eating only cooked or freshly peeled fruits and vegetables, and avoiding raw or undercooked meat and seafood [13] .",

When there are mild or moderate symptoms and one to two loose stools per day without blood in the stool, an antimotility agent can be added.

Antibacterial agents shown to be effective in traveler's diarrhea include the fluoroquinolones, although resistance rates are increasing in some areas and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is a potential side effect of concern. Azithromycin and rifaximin are also effective treatments for traveler's diarrhea [31] [32] [33] .

Some of the diseases identified during the health assessment may be reportable to US public health authorities (eg, tuberculosis, Giardia, measles) and require investigation of the household. Rarely, such as during the SARS outbreak in 2003, household isolation has been required for internationally adopted children. Preparation for these situations and explanation of the role of the public health system in identifying contacts of the child so as to prevent additional infections are helpful for parents and may reduce anxiety. Health care professionals seeing internationally adopted children should also involve public health authorities in the event of severe or unusual diseases in these children, because the public health authorities may be able to provide additional diagnostic or epidemiologic information in the event of a unique outbreak or new agent, such as SARS or avian influenza.",
