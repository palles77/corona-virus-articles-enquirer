            "text": "Various methods for the control of PRRS virus have been published. The technology of nursery depopulation (ND) appears to effectively control the spread of virus between members of endemically infected populations. ND consists of a strategic adjustment in pigflow based on the presence of specific serologic patterns as detected by the indirect fluorescent antibody test. This pattern indicates a low seroprevalence of antibodies detected in the breeding herd and recently weaned piglets ( I 10%). in contrast to a high ( > 50%) seroprevalence in 8 to 10 week old piglets. ND has been carried out on swine farms in the US and results indicate improvements in nursery piglet growth rate and mortality levels. Three examples are provided in the following text. Recently a modified live virus vaccine (RespPRRS, NOBL Laboratories/Boerhinger Ingleheim) has become commercially available. It is currently approved for use in piglets from 3 to 18 weeks of age: however. potential for the use in adult animals is currently under investigation. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Other members of this group include equine viral arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus of mice and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (Meulenberg et al., 1995) . Infected herds may experience severe reproductive losses and/or increased levels of post weaning pneumonia with poor growth. The reproductive phase typically lasts for 2-3 months, however post weaning problems often become endemic. A reduction in growth rate (50-85%), an increase in the percentage of unmarketable (cull) pigs (10-30%/c) and elevated post weaning mortality (lo-2.5%) can be seen (Polson et al., 1994) . Diagnostic findings indicate a high level of pneumonia, with the isolation of PRRS virus in complex with a wide variety of other microbial agents. Bacterial isolates may include Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Salmonella cholerae-suis.",

The economic impact of the post weaning form of the disease can be severe.

One disadvantage of this protocol is the need for an offsite facility that can handle the nursery pigs during the clean-up period. In order to alleviate this problem, finishing facilities can be temporarily remodelled to accommodate young pigs by using hovers, straw bedding, heat lamps and lying boards to reduce the chilling effect of the concrete floors. Ideally, such a project should take place during warm weather, not only to improve the comfort of the piglets, but also to enhance the killing of the virus. If farrowing space is available, weaned pigs could remain in the crates or farrowing could be purposely skipped via strategic planning of matings to avoid having to wean offsite. Overbreeding later, together with early weaning could make up for the missed farrowings. This procedure would minimize the need for an offsite nursery but does require careful planning.",

A high prevalence of IFA negative sows was important for the success of this program, because it indicates the absence of active viral shedding or recent exposure in the sow herd. Samples from the finishing barn should be at the most 25 to 50% positive, with titers in the range of 1: 16-1:64.

Published data has indicated that PRRS positive animals may enter negative herds if proper isolation and serologic monitoring is carried out (Dee et al., 19941 . Sequential testing of specific animals has been recommended as a way to monitor the presence of circulating PRRS virus in an isolated population. Seronegative sentinel animals are also helpful to assess whether viral transmission is taking place. Following collection of evidence of antibody decay in monitored stock, as well as no evidence of seroconversion in sentinels, the animals in question may enter a herd.",

The primary serologic test used in these protocols has been the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), which measures IgG. However a new IgM IFA test may be an applicable tool for monitoring active infection in similar situations. IgM titers are highly correlated with the presence of viremia and are short lived (Joe et al., 199.5) .",

It is a modified live vaccine and approved for use in pigs from 3-l 8 weeks of age. The vaccine is not approved in breeding animals, however if it proves to be safe in pregnant sows, the use of vaccine may provide a consistent, protective immune response in the breeding herd. This could be critical to the success of controlling transmission of PRRS virus in adult populations. Until then, the use of the product in adult animals depends on farm specific data, discretionary use and valid veterinary-client-patient relationship. To conclude, it must be emphasized that it is important to view vaccination as a part of a control program, not the final solution. Practitioners must be sure to collect adequate data and attempt to understand patterns of viral transmission, the risk of persistent infection and whether naive subpopulations of animals exist within infected farms, prior to implementing its use.",

Practitioners are using available diagnostic tools to acquire answers to many questions, including differences in exposure level to PRRS virus within populations, determining the PRRS serostatus of replacement animals and whether stage specific viral transmission exists. However, in spite of all our progress PRRS is still a frustrating disease. Not everything has been successful and more answers are needed. Communication with research scientists and close working relationships with diagnosticians appears to be very important for the development of new measures of control, as well as the improvement of existing strategies.",
