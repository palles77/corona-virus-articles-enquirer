Here, we investigated the nutritional functions of preserved eggs by in vivo and in vitro experiments. The results of in vivo studies showed that the levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TCHO) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) were significantly decreased (p<0.05) in the liver of rats treated with preserved eggs. Meanwhile, the levels of two important cancer markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), were also significantly decreased (p<0.05) in treated rats. In vitro studies were performed on Caco-2 cells, a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. It demonstrated that the gastrointestinal (GI) digests of preserved eggs significantly accelerated (p<0.05) the apoptosis by upregulating caspase-3 in the Caco-2 cells. Besides, after treated with preserved eggs, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of preserved eggs digests to Caco-2 cells was 5.75 mg/mL, indicating the significant inhibition of cell proliferation provided by preserved eggs (p<0.05). The results shown in this study demonstrated that preserved eggs may be a novel functional food involved with antilipemic, anti-inflammatory activity as well as the effect on accelarating the apoptosis of Caco-2 cells.",

Studies have shown that preserved egg white hydrolysates show anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo experiments and can significantly decrease the expression levels of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 (Zhao et al., 2017) . In addition, ACE-inhibitory peptides isolated from preserved eggs proved their antioxidant activity in vitro (Yang, 2016) . Numerous studies have indicated that alkaline foods, such as kelp (Yuan and Walsh, 2006) , grape (Renaud and De, 1992) , and bitter gourd (Rajasekhar et al., 2012) , can inhibit the growth of various human cancer cell lines. The results showed that the algae polyphenols extracted from kelp can inhibit the rancidity of fish oil and the antioxidant efficiency was 2.6-fold higher than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (Yan et al., 1996) . Researchers found that seaweed polyphenols can significantly inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and the inhibition effect was linearly correlated to the total level of phenol in seaweed (Yuan and Walsh, 2006) . Resveratrol in grapes was shown to have inhibitory effects on cancer cell initiation, proliferation and development (Corder et al., 2001) .",

However, as the dose raised up to high level (4.2 mg/mL), the TG levels in rats increased compared to treatment with low doses of preserved eggs.

FAS is the key enzyme in liver fatty acid synthesis, TG increases with the increasement of the FAS (Postic and Girard, 2008) .",

Actually, our body health has been proved to be favored by an appropriate of eggs intake daily because it exerts protective effect on our heart. The ingredients in the eggs can also regulate the absorption and metabolism of cholesterol and counteract the damage caused by excessive intake on the body (Yang, 2013) .

After treatment with preserved egg, the level of LDL was significantly inhibited compared with the control, and an increase of LDL level was observed as the concentration of preserved egg increased. It may be due to TG invoved in preserved eggs upregulating LDL-C levels (Cullen, 2000; Ji et al., 2013) , as the dosage of preserved eggs increased, the level of LDL-C increased.

After treatment with preserved eggs of low dose, the LDL-C levels in the liver were reduced by 92.8% compared with the control group. In previous studies, LDL and LDL / HDL could be used to predict CVD, and the risk of CVD can be reduced lowering by 20% if LDL-C wad reduced by 1 mmol/L (Baigent et al., 2005) . Based on this, we suspected that active ingredients such as lecithin in preserved eggs may have the potential to reduce the risk of CVD, AS, and other diseases by inhibiting the synthesis of LDL-C and promoting the synthesis of HDL-C (Poutanen et al., 2003) . In future, we will do further experiments to find out the exactly active ingredients. Furthermore, the intake of preserved eggs depressed the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and these indicators are significantly related to the occurrence of inflammation and cancer in rats (Kim et al., 2013; Suganuma et al., 2012) .
