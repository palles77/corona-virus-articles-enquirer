It is well established that porcine intestinal epithelium is the target of the TGEV infection, however the mechanism that TGEV invades the host epithelium remains largely unknown. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a known receptor of TGEV. This study discovered that the extracellular receptor binding domain 1 pertaining to epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) interact with TGEV spike protein. APN and EGFR synergistically promote TGEV invasion. TGEV promotes APN and EGFR clustering early in infection. Furthermore APN and EGFR synergistically stimulate PI3K/AKT as well as MEK/ERK1/2 endocytosis signaling pathways. TGEV entry is via clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis in IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV binds with EGFR, and subsequently promotes EGFR internalization by a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. These results show that EGFR is a co-factor of TGEV, and that it plays a synergistic role with APN early in TGEV infection.",

            "text": "The high degree of tropism of TGEV for the villous enterocytes of newborn pigs is well established and has been suggested as being a factor in age sensitivity of newborn pigs to the virus (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler, 2006) . There has been some confusion around the question that if APN is the only receptor for TGEV entry, why older piglets are not susceptible to TGEV, especially since APN was found to be highly expressed in villous enterocytes of both newborn and older piglets. Research suggest a known protein, approximately 200-kDa in size, only expressed in the upper villi of newborn piglets, it has high affinity for TGEV (Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1994) . It has also been demonstrated that APN is not essential for PEDV cell entry (Ji et al., 2018; Li et al., 2017) . It is most likely that TGEV do have more than one receptor. Many cell surface components have been identified as virus receptors, including: chemokine receptors (Feng et al., 1996) , fibroblast growth factor receptors (Qing et al., 1999) , the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (Terry-Allison et al., 1998) , and integrin (Wang et al., 2005) . pidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) family, is widely expressed on many cells including epithelial and mesenchymal cells (Wells, 1999b) . It has been demonstrated that many viruses interact with EGFR to facilitate viral entrance, including: influenza A virus (IAV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Chan et al., 2009; Eierhoff et al., 2010a; Lupberger et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2014b) . Ligand binding to EGFR induce receptor dimerization and cross phosphorylation, which in turn actives the intracellular signaling cascades critical for cellular protein synthesis, cytoskeleton reorganisation, apoptotic inhibition, transcriptional activation, and cell motility. The ligand binding to EGFR results in rearrangement of the cytoskeleton network through EGFR-mediated signaling, and subsequently ligand-EGFR complexes are internalize through clathrin-coated pits (Zheng et al., 2014a) . Many researchers have shown that numerous viruses utilize EGFR endocytosis to mediate virus internalization (Mercer et al., 2010a) . The interactions between viruses and their receptors are specific, but the affinity is low. Many multiple receptor binding sites exist on virus particles which are likely to cluster receptor proteins. It is known that multiple viruses use more than one type receptor to aid uptake into host cells (Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . EGFR also has been identified as a co-receptor for many viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and adenoassociated virus serotype 6 (AAV6) (Lupberger et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2003; Weller et al., 2010) . Previous studies that we have conducted demonstrated that TGEV spike protein interacts with EGFR, and stimulates phosphorylation of cofilin as well as stimulating polymerization of F-actin through the PI3K-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling pathway. This is required for efficient TGEV entry (Hu et al., 2016) . We further demonstrate whether EGFR is another co-factor for TGEV. EGFR is a transmembrane protein with two dimer forms, it can be divided into extracellular, transmembranal, and intracellular regions. Its extracellular region contains two receptor-binding domains Receptor 1 (57-168 aa) and Receptor 2 (361-481 aa). Its intracellular protein associated with tyrosine kinase PI3K/Akt and Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathways are activated by phosphorylated tyrosine located in EGFR cytoplasmic tails (Fig. 1A) . The objective of our present study was also to study the relationship between APN and EGFR in the early stage of TGEV infection.",

To determine whether EGFR can induce the endocytosis signaling pathway to support TGEV entry, the activation of EGFR, PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 were investigated. Cells were incubated with TGEV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, and unbound viruses were removed.

In APN overexpressed, EGFR overexpressed, and APN+EGFR overexpressed cells, Overexpression of EGFR and APN were confirmed in Figs. 4A and S1, TGEV infection caused an a comparably increased phosphorylation level of EGFR, Akt, as well as ERK1/2 than that of the TGEV infection control group ( Fig. 4A and C) . In APN-targeting shRNA, EGFR-targeting shRNA, and APN+EGFR-targeting shRNAs cells, TGEV infection resulted in the decreased phosphorylation level of EGFR, Akt, and ERK1/2 significantly in comparison to the TGEV infection control group (Fig. 4F-H) . APN-targeting shRNA inhibited TGEV-induced EGFR activation more significantly than EGFR-targeting shRNA (Fig. 4B and F) .

RT-PCR for detection TGEV invasion results showed that both clathrin and caveolin targeting shRNAs significantly inhibited TGEV entry (Fig. 5C and D) .

Our previous studies have found that nystatin, an cholesterol removing agent which also functions by inhibiting the lipid/caveolin pathway can in fact inhibit TGEV binding and entry. This result also show us that caveolin-mediated endocytosis is a method that can be utilized in TGEV internalization. To verify and confirm our results, clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis specific markers were used to provide direct evidence in an attempt to prove the TGEV endocytosis pathway.

PI3K activation has been demonstrated to regulate vesicular uptake, and trafficking of Ebola virus (Saeed et al., 2008) . Ligand binding to EGFR on the cell surface induces receptor dimerization and cross phosphorylation, which leads to the activation of downstream signaling cascades of which include: MAPK, PI3K, JAK/ STAT, and PLC\u03b3 signaling pathways (Zheng et al., 2014a) . In this study, we found that early in the TGEV infection process, APN and EGFR synergistically stimulate PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways, and promoted TGEV entry.",

Enveloped viruses are capable of entering directly through the cell membrane surface receptors, or are able to be internalizing via endocytosis via fusion taking place in the endosomal compartment (Belouzard et al., 2012) . Our previous published research found that TGEV can be internalized into IPEC-J2 cells, however the mechanism of TGEV entry is still not known. It has been confirmed that PEDV invades via clathrin-mediated endocytosis independent of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (Park et al., 2014) . Our results suggest that TGEV infection reduces in clathrin or caveolin targeting shRNAs cells. Furthermore, co-localization between endocytosed FITC-transferrin/ FITC-CtxB and fluorochrome-labeled TGEV support the conclusion that both clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytic uptake are the pathways of TGEV entry. Typically for particle sizes internalized through caveolin ranging from 50 to 100 nm and through clathrin less than 200 nm (Aleksandrowicz et al., 2011) . TGEV particles sizes are between 100 and 150 nm, some are smaller TGEV particles that are internalized through caveolin-mediated endocytosis.",

Our previous research has also found that TGEV infection induces actin cytoskeleton rearrangement through cofilin, and actin surround TGEV particles in the spatial part of the virus co-localize with the actin, which indicates that clathrin and actin are involved in the early invasion of TGEV. Receptor clustering is an actin-dependent process that uses RHO-family GTPase signaling, and the actin regulatory proteins filamin and cofilin (Jimenez- Baranda et al., 2007; Yoder et al., 2008) . The co-localization of APN and EGFR is also found in the early infection of TGEV, suggesting that EGFR phosphorylation and PI3K-Rac1/Cdc42-LIMK-Cofilin signaling pathways participate in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. TGEV particles movement towards entry sites, the co-localization of APN and EGFR are all mediated by actin cytoskeleton re-modeling.",

Upon ligand binding, EGFR is activated and internalized via clathrin-coated pits (Wells, 1999a; Zheng et al., 2014b) . Numerous viruses utilize EGFR endocytosis to mediate virus internalization and trafficking to the site of replication during the infection of the host cell (Mercer et al., 2010b) . Some previous studies have suggested clathrin-coated pits can form naturally at 0\u00b0C in the presence of EGF, but are not internalized into the cytoplasm (Brown and Petersen, 1998; Jiang et al., 2003) . Clathrin-coated pits connected to the cell surface and clathrin-coated vesicles are intracellular membranal structures. Lipid rafts function as platforms to active intracellular EGFR effector signals and EGFR internalization (Puri et al., 2005) . In this study we found that when EGF was incubated with cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, EGF formed clathrin-coated pits connected to the cell surface and EGFR became localized in the coated pits. When cells were transferred at 37\u00b0C, EGFR was rapidly internalized into the cytoplasm through clathrin-coated vesicles. For TGEV infected cells, TGEV particles bound with cells at 4\u00b0C. As soon as cells were transferred at 37\u00b0C, TGEV stimulated clustering of lipid rafts and activated EGFR and effector signals. This process took comparatively more time, hence at 15 mpi, EGFR was found to begin internalization of TGEV particles. In this study, we found that TGEV infection caused EGFR internalization, and clathrin-targeting shRNA inhibited EGFR internalization. EGFR also was identified as an another receptor for TGEV. We can get to the conclusion that in the early infection stage of TGEV, TGEV particles bound with APN and EGFR, the virus-receptors complex are subsequently internalized by clathrin. Caveolin targeting shRNA has no effect on the internalization of EGFR. However further research is needed to specify the mechanism of TGEV particles internalized by caveolin.",
