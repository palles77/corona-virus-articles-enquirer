            "text": "Granite fines, sand, rice hulls, long wheat straw, and wood shavings were compared as bedding for 60 female dairy calves. Growth, health, stress indices, and behavior of newly born calves, along with physical characteristics and bacterial counts of bedding, were evaluated for 42 d during August to October, 2002. Overall average daily gain and dry matter intake of calves did not differ due to bedding type, although during wk 2 calves housed on rice hulls had the greatest dry matter intake and those housed on wood shavings had the lowest. During wk 2, calves housed on granite fines and sand were treated more often for scours, and calves housed on long wheat straw received the fewest antibiotic treatments (week by bedding material interaction). Granite fines formed a harder surface than other bedding, and calves housed on granite fines scored the dirtiest. When bedding materials were evaluated, sand was scored to be the dirtiest, while pens bedded with rice hulls, long wheat straw, and wood shavings scored cleaner. Long wheat straw had the warmest surface temperature, and rice hulls and wood shavings were warmer than granite fines and sand. Serum cortisol, \u03b1 1 -acid glycoprotein, immunoglobulin G concentrations, and the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio were not affected by bedding type. On d 0, coliform counts were greatest in rice hulls. After use, coliform counts were greatest in long wheat straw (week by bedding material interaction). On d 42, the concentration of ammonia at 10 cm above the bedding was lowest for long wheat straw. Growth performance of calves bedded for 42 d with 5 bedding types did not differ; however, the number of antibiotic treatments given for scours was greatest on granite fines and sand; coliform counts in the bedding were highest in rice 3736 hulls before use and in long wheat straw after 42 d of use.",

            "text": "The early preweaning stage of a calf's life is critical. Housing and environmental factors, including bedding material, are important. The use of bedding material for calves can provide comfort, decrease the risk of contracting disease, and reduce stress. Norheim and Simensen (1985) reported that calves kept on elevated, perforated floors had higher IgG than calves kept on a solid floor without bedding. However, when calves were older than 30 d, concentrations of IgG were greatest when calves were kept on the solid floor with use of some bedding. Hunter and Houpt (1989) studied bedding preference in ponies and concluded that they preferred areas of pens bedded with wood shavings rather than bare concrete. Lactating cows preferred to use free-stalls bedded with sand or sawdust compared with mattresses (Tucker et al., 2003) . However, temperature and humidity may affect the animal's behavior, quality of bedding materials, and bacteria in the bedding types (Hogan et al., 1989; Bey et al., 2002) . In summer, pigs prefer to lie on concrete floors, but in winter they prefer to lie on straw bedding (Fraser, 1985) . Lactating cows preferred free-stalls bedded with sand as compared with mattresses in summer; however, cows used stalls bedded with mattresses and sawdust in the winter (Thoreson et al., 2000) . Long wheat straw has been used traditionally for calf bedding, but it is expensive or unavailable in many areas. Other reasonably priced materials available in Central Arkansas are granite fines, rice hulls, and wood shavings.",

About 150 female calves were housed in a barn that was 18.3 m wide and 68.6 m long with open sides that were 4.3 m high. Pens (1.2 \u00d7 1.8 m) used during the trial were located in the middle of the calf barn. The trial was conducted from August to October 2002. Physical contact among calves was prevented by 0.6-m spaces between pens or by a wooden wall (1.1 m high) that separated adjoining pens. All pens had plastic buckets for feed and water attached outside the front of the pen. Dirt floors were covered with 2.5 cm (mean weight of 99 kg) of ground limestone (grade 4). Limestone was covered with 5.1 cm of the different types of bedding material composing the 5 treatments. The 5 bedding types were river sand (Lentz Company, Morrilton, AR); granite fines, a by-product of crushing syenite granite rock (Donna Fill Granite Fines, Little Rock, AR); rice hulls (Brinkley Dryer, Brinkley, AR); long wheat straw; or soft wood shavings (Travis Lumber Co., Mansfield, AR). The long wheat straw was delivered baled, and the other materials were delivered loose in bulk. Costs of bedding material (retail price/100 kg) were $0.22 for granite fines, $0.44 for sand, $0.50 for rice hulls, $10 for long wheat straw, and $1.10 for wood shavings. The densities (kg/m 3 ) of the bedding materials were measured to be 1605 for granite fines, 1352 for sand, 92.9 for rice hulls, 69.7 for long wheat straw, and 139.4 for wood shavings. With the exception of wheat straw, these densities represent the weight of materials as they were shoveled into pens to a depth of 5.1 cm. For pens bedded with wheat straw, the straw was torn from the bale in 5.1-cm thick sections, which were laid intact in the pen to cover the floor. These sections were then scattered, and the depth of this loose material exceeded 5.1 cm at the start of the study. Hardness was measured with a DICKEY-john Soil Compaction tester (DICKEY-john Corporation, Auburn, IL) at 3.2 kg/cm 2 of pressure with a 6.3-cm diameter disk. Hardness was reported as the centimeters of penetration of the disk Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 87, No. 11, 2004 into the material; therefore, larger numbers indicate softer materials. Five sites within the pen (approximately 25 cm from each corner and a center point) were measured and averaged before placing the calf in the pen. On d 0, bedding samples were collected to measure DM and absorbency.",

Calves were injected intramuscularly with 1 mL of iron hydrogenated dextran (containing 100 mg of Fe; VEDCO, Inc., St. Joseph, MO), 1 mL of vitamin A (500,000 IU) and D (75,000 IU; VEDCO, Inc.), and 6 mL of selenium and vitamin E (2.19 mg sodium selenite/mL [1 mg selenium/mL] and 50 mg [68 USP units] of vitamin E/mL; BO-SE; Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp., Union, NJ). Each calf was identified with an ear tag, and its navel cord was dipped with 10% tincture of iodine (VEDCO, Inc.) . No colostrum from the dams was fed to calves. Calves were fed 350 g of a commercial colostrum supplement (Colostrum Plus Bovine IgG-Escherichia coli Antibody; Jorgensen Laboratories, Inc., Loveland, CO) one time only within 6 h of birth by plastic esophageal feeder. Calves were reweighed at 1 d of age to establish an average initial BW. At 1 d of age, calves were randomly assigned to individual pens on 1 of 5 types of bedding materials (12 calves per treatment). Calves began the study over a 4-wk period (3 calves per treatment per week). The week that calves started was used as a block in the statistical models.",

These subsamples from each pen (from 100 to 140 g of the bedding materials) were composited and placed into sterile plastic bags. Upon arrival at the laboratory, 20 g of the bedding sample were removed and analyzed for DM by drying in an oven at 100\u00b0C for 24 h. Then 5 g (ambient weight) was removed and mixed with 45 mL of deionized water for 20 min to analyze pH with a pH meter (Denver Instrumental Co., Denver, CO), then left for 3 h to allow absorption of water. After 3 h, excess water was poured from the sample and a wet weight was obtained (Zehner et al., 1986) .

Gram-negative bacteria counts on d 28 and 42 did not differ from d 14 for any bedding materials. Coliform counts on d 14 for all bedding except rice hulls were higher than those on d 28 and 42.

Long wheat straw had greater amino acids, no inhibitory substrates (Bey et al., 2002) , lower C:N ratio (Ward et al., 2000) , and higher absorbency for bacteria growth compared with wood shavings.",

In addition, the number of days calves were treated with antibiotics due to scours was affected (P < 0.05) by bedding materials during the first 2 wk, with calves on sand and granite fines having the higher rate of treatment. Bedding materials had no effect on serum IgG concentration, stress indices (cortisol and N:L ratio), and AGP. These blood variables were influenced by week. Calf behavior and activities except time spent drinking were affected by week (P < 0.05). Bedding types affected (P < 0.05) self-grooming only. Overall, the results of this study suggested that the performance of heifer calves, regardless of bedding materials used during the preweaning stage, were similar. This study was conducted in the late summer and fall, during a period of moderate temperatures. Differences in calf performance due to bedding material may occur in colder environmental temperatures, and this possibility warrants further investigation.",
