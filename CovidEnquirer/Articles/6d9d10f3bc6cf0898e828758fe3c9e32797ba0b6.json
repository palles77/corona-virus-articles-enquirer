We aimed to study the viral etiology of AECOPD in Hong Kong. Methods: Patients admitted to an acute hospital in Hong Kong with AECOPD were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004, to April 30, 2005. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture. Spirometry was performed in the stable phase at 2 to 3 months after hospital discharge. Results: There were 262 episodes of AECOPD among 196 patients (mean age, 75.7 \u060e 7.7 years [\u060e SD]; 160 men). Mean FEV 1 was 39.6 \u060e 18.9% of predicted normal, and FEV 1 /FVC ratio was 58.0 \u060e 15.2%. Fifty-eight episodes (22.1%) yielded positive viral PCR results. The viruses identified were influenza A (7.3%), coronavirus OC43 (4.6%), rhinovirus (3.1%), influenza B (2.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (2.3%). The diagnostic yield of viral identification by PCR was 2.7 times higher than that based on conventional viral culture. The rates of identifying a positive viral etiology by PCR were similar among the subjects with FEV 1 > 50%, > 30 to 50%, and < 30% of predicted normal. Viral infection appeared to have no effect on subsequent readmissions or mortality rate over a study period of 1 year Conclusion: Influenza A and two less-attended viruses, coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus, were the common etiologic agents in patients hospitalized with AECOPD in Hong Kong. These should be considered in developing diagnostic and intervening strategies pertaining to AECOPD.",

In Hong Kong, COPD was the fifth-leading cause of death, and accounted for at least 4% of all public hospital acute admissions in 2003. We have previously shown that in patients hospitalized with AECOPD, the 1-year readmission rate was 2.2 episodes, whereas the 1-year mortality rate was 14%. 4 Common etiologic factors of AECOPD include infections, 5,6 air pollution, 7 withdrawal of medications, 8 or change in temperature. 9 Etiologic agents may vary in different geographic locations. We pre-viously conducted a 1-year prospective study 10 on the infectious etiology related to AECOPD in Hong Kong, with identification of viruses based on viral culture of the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) and blood serology. However, these methods lack sensitivity in comparison to the newer technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for virus identification.",

Rhinovirus is a major cause of common cold in the community. 25, 31 As there is increasing evidence that rhinovirus may directly infect the lower airway in patients with COPD, 32-34 sampling lower airway secretions in addition to the upper airway may lead to a higher diagnostic yield of viruses. In our study, the most common virus identified was influenza virus. This might be due to the relatively low influenza vaccination rate of 40.3% in this study as compared to 74% in the East London cohort. 25 In Hong Kong, H1N1 has been the predominant circulating strain of influenza in recent years, 35, 36 but all our patients with AECOPD and proven influenza A infection in this study had H3 strain identified. Previous studies 37, 38 in the United States have reported that H3N2 was more virulent than H1N1, and hospital admissions for chest infection and related deaths were significantly higher when H3N2 influenza was prevalent. Similar to our study, other studies of AECOPD have also identified rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, and adenovirus in their subjects, although the percentages varied in different studies. 25, 39, 40 Human metapneumovirus was identified in only one episode (0.4%) of AECOPD in this study, whereas other studies have reported low detection rates of 2.3% and 6% from induced sputum 41 and NPA samples, 42 respectively. We have found no evidence of M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae infection, and this observation was consistent with previous studies. 25, 43 It appeared that patients with positive NPA PCR and positive viral culture results had more severe exacerbations, as evidenced by a longer length of stay in hospital, than those with positive NPA PCR and negative viral culture results. The results might suggest that the viruses in the NPA of patients with positive NPA PCR and viral culture results were \"active\" and \"replicating,\" and thus resulted in more severe AECOPD and a longer hospital stay.",

The observation of influenza season in the spring/winter period was consistent with other overseas studies 9,40 and another local study. 44 A second peak of influenza-like illness in summer in this current study of AECOPD patients requiring hospitalization was also in line with the seasonality of influenza in the general community in Hong Kong. 36 There was no significant difference in the rates of positive PCR results from NPA between COPD patients who had received influenza vaccination over the past 12 months and those who had not. Wongsurakiat et al 45 previously showed that AE-COPD (defined by symptoms in their study) and influenza-related acute respiratory illness (confirmed by serology test or viral culture from respiratory secretions) requiring hospitalization could not be decreased by influenza vaccination. It is currently recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guideline that annual influenza vaccination be offered to COPD patients. 1 In elderly subjects in the general community (not specific for COPD subjects), some studies have found that influenza vaccine could halve the incidence of serologic and clinical influenza 46 and reduce utilization of hospital resources. 47 However, not all subjects who have received influenza vaccination could have a protective antibody response. 45 In the study by Wongsurakiat et al, 45 approximately 80% and 50% of the subjects had an antibody response to influenza A and influenza B, respectively. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of annual influenza vaccination and any role for a booster dose for COPD patients. The limitation of this study was that this was a single-center study, although our hospital served a large population of 0.6 million. Due to limited resources, patients were recruited every alternate day, although the demographics of these patients were representative of the whole group when compared to our previous study. 10 In addition, no patients with a stable state of COPD were recruited as control subjects, and it was thus not sure whether the viruses identified in the NPA were true pathogens or represented \"colonization\" or \"chronic infection.\" Previous studies 25, 26, 48 using the PCR technique could identify some viruses (including piconavirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenaza 3, and RSV) in the respiratory specimens of stable COPD patients. As the rate of viruses identification in patients with stable-state COPD was much lower than that during AECOPD and most RSV infections in patients with COPD were associated with symptomatic respiratory illness together with measurable immune responses, 48 it is highly likely that viral infections play an important role in triggering AECOPD.",

The common viruses were influenza A, coronavirus OC43, and rhinovirus. Viral infections appeared to have no effect on subsequent readmission rates or mortality rate over a study period of 1 year, and there was no difference in the rates of viral infections among COPD patients in different GOLD stages. In recent years, there is growing epidemiologic evidence linking viruses to AECOPD. 49 It is worth noting that coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus are both fastidious to growth, and are not covered by the routine diagnostic spectrum in most service laboratories. Our data have shown that coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus could also exacerbate COPD. Further studies on the diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for these \"trivial\" viruses are needed in addition to exploring the mechanisms of how viruses may induce AECOPD.",
