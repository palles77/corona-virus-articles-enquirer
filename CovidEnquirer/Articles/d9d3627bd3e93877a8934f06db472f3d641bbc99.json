Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MI-IV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict h4HV3 replication. This mechanism of cellular restriction of the virus by MHV3-activated macrophages from the resistant A/J strain appeared to be one of the sensitive targets for the suppressive action of dieldrin on host resistance, as (i) no major changes in macrophage cellular parameters were observed in in vitro studies of cell viability, adherence to plastic, and superoxide anion generation; (ii) the increased cell yield in the peritoneal exudates during MI-IV3 virus infection was not affected by dieldrin exposure; and (iii) the attachment and uptake of ['H]MHV3 by virus-activated macophages was shown to be unchanged by dieldrin exposure.",

            "text": "Restriction of virus replication by macrophages is the primary defense mechanism in several virus infections, including that with MHV3 [l-5] . It is generally accepted that the most important factors determining whether the infected host recovers or not are the virulence of the virus and the ability of the defense mechanisms of the host to control the viral infection. It is also known that immune deficiencies, including xenobiotic-induced suppression of the host defense mechanism, can result in severe viral disease, in many cases leading to death [6-81. In preliminary studies, we found an increased susceptibility to acute disease induced by MHV3 infection in the genetically MHV3-susceptible C57B1/6 strain and semisusceptible (C57B1/6 x A/J)FI hybrids challenged with sublethal doses of the organochlorine pesticide, dieldrin [9] . In vitro experiments showed decreased phagocytosis and decreased resistance to MHV3-cytolysis by peritoneal macrophages after exposure to dieldrin [9] . This pesticide, which is a potent health hazard for humans [lo] , has been shown to be a potent toxic agent affecting the population of peritoneal macrophages [ll, 121. In this study, we describe the interaction of dieldrin with mouse peritoneal macrophages, which are the primary target cells in MI-IV3 infection and which can be antivirally activated in the genetically MHV3-resistant A/J mouse strain. Further evidence of the suppressive effect of dieldrin on macrophage functions is provided here.",

Briefly, spleen cells were incubated at 37\" in RPMI-1640 medium (Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Appropriate dilutions of culture supernatant fractions and sera were incubated with MHV3 antigen prepared as homogenate of MHV3-infected L cells [19] and incubated in flatbottom Linbro microplates (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA), followed by saturation with 1.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer and 200 mM NaCl, final pH 8.0. Appropriate controls were performed with non-infected L-cell homogenates. As a second antibody, peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1: 3000. The substrate for peroxidase development was 2,3-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline) sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaitherburg, MD), and the colored product was determined spectrophotometrically at 0.D.M50snm. MHV3 antigen in peritoneal exudates originating from virus-infected and dieldrin-exposed and control animals was quantified by the dot-blot immunoperoxidase dilution test [21] as described previously [9] . Briefly, appropriate dilutions of cellular homogenates were applied as spots onto nitrocellulose papers, saturated with 1.5% bovine serum albumin in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer and 200 mM NaCl, final pH 8.0, and incubated with anti-MHV3 mouse serum [13] , followed by reaction with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) and coloration with hydrogen peroxide and 4-chloro-l-naphthol (Sigma). A positive reaction was detected as a colored dot against the white nitrocellulose background. The results are expressed as minimal cell number giving positive immunoperoxidase reaction.",

In the first experiment, we followed the recovery from MHV3 infection in control or vehicle-treated A/J mice, or in animals exposed 4 days prior to infection to a single sublethal i.p. dose of the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin (36mg/kg body weight). On each day following virus infection, virus clearance by the primary target cells for MHV3 infection, i.e. peritoneal exudate macrophages, was examined. This was determined by immunochemical dot-blot quantification of cell-associated MHV3 antigens, virus titer, and virusinduced foci formation in cultures of peritoneal macrophages incubated in vitro at 37\", 5% CO,, for 48 hr (Fig. 1 ). In untreated controls and vehicleexposed animals, recovery from acute MHV3 disease was completed within 4 days, as (i) no virulent MHV3 was detectable at days 5-7 postinfection in cultures of peritoneal macrophages collected from infected animals, (ii) relatively low foci formation was observed in these cell cultures 48 hr after in vitro incubation, and (iii) only traces of MHV3-antigen were detectable in lo0 cells by the immunochemical dot-blot dilution test (Fig. 1 ). Macrophages from dieldrin-exposed animals displayed high foci formation at days 3 and 4 postinfection, a high amount of MHV3-antigen was already detectable at days 2 and 3 postinfection, and virulent MHV3 was found in supematant fractions of 48-hr macrophage cultures at 2-6 days postinfection (Fig. 1 ). It appeared, therefore, that recovery from MHVfacute disease in dieldrin-exposed animals was suppressed and took longer than in vehicle and unexposed controls. The spread of the virus in dieldrin-exposed animals was also more rapid, as shown by high amounts of MHV3-antigen in peritoneal exudates at 2 and 3 days postinfection and by markedly elevated virusinduced CPE. There was, however, full recovery from the disease at day 7 in all three groups of animals as no virus was detectable by either immunochemical dot-blot MHV3 antigen coloration, or virus titration. Foci formation in macrophage cultures was extremely low and comparable with the formation of spontaneous foci. The viability of cells was over 95% in all three groups of macrophage cultures, at day 7 postinfection, as determined by the trypan blue exclusion test ( Table 1) . Phagocytosis of 51Cr-labelled sheep erythrocytes by macrophages collected at day 7 after infection with MHV3 showed no significant differences between dieldrin group and control groups ( Table 1) . Formation of superoxide anion was elevated in all three MHV3-infected groups (Table l) , as compared with generation of superoxide anion by uninfected controls (87.0 * 16.2 nmoles Ol/mg protein, P < 0.01). This was determined by incubation of macrophages with opsonized zymosan, with or without superoxide dismutase, and the cytochrome c reduction assay. In other experiments, we determined the generation of superoxide anion by peritoneal macrophages from A/J resistant mice exposed to different sublethal dieldrin doses, O-36mg/kg body wt and subsequently infected with lo3 LD~o MHV3,4 days after exposure. Similar to previous results, macrophages collected 7 days after MHV3 infection, generated from 182.6 + 12.0nmoles O;/mg protein to 219.2 +-20.1 nmoles O,/mg protein after exposure to single dieldrin doses (4.5, 9, 18 and 36mg/kg body wt), which was not statistically significant, as compared to vehicle and untreated controls (P > 0.5).",

Subsequently, these dieldrin-exposed, vehicle-treated, and untreated animals of appropriate age were immunized by i.p. injection of lo3 MI-IV3 and, 7 days later, peritoneal macrophages, blood sera and spleens were collected. Humoral immune response to MHV3 was examined by determination of anti-MHV3 IgG antibodies in sera and culture super-natant fractions of spleen cells cultured' for 24 hr and compared to the humoral response shortly after exposure to dieldrin (Table 3) . Furthermore, macrophage restriction of virus replication was examined after in uitro infection with MHV3 (Table 3) . The results showed inhibition of MHV3 restriction by macrophages and inhibition of anti-MHV3 IgG antibody titer in sera and supematant fractions of spleen cultures shortly after exposure to dieldrin, but not after a 3-month interval (Table 3 ). It appears, therefore, that despite heavy intoxication of animals with dieldrin, after an interval longer than the life-time of macrophages, there was no suppression of MHV3 Thus, exposure to a single, sublethal dose of dieldrin inhibited cellular capacities of virus restriction by MHV3-activated peritoneal macrophages in the genetically resistant A/J strain in acute MHV3disease. The humoral immune response to MI-IV3 was also inhibited by dieldrin exposure. These results indicate, therefore, that both the immune response and natural resistance mechanisms, such as antiviral macrophage activation, can be suppressed by the exposure to dieldrin.",

We present evidence that antiviral activation of peritoneal macrophages of MHV3-challenged, resistant A/J mice can be at least one of the targets for interaction of sublethal doses of dieldrin with the host's defense mechanisms to control viral infection. This intrinsic capacity of MHV3-activated macrophages to restrict the virus appeared to be highly sensitive to sublethal dieldrin exposure since in vitro studies revealed no major changes in other cellular variables, such as viability, adherence to P lastic, generation of superoxide anion, uptake of 'Cr-labelled sheep erythrocytes, and incorporation of [3H]uridine. It must be emphasized, however, that dieldrin, depending on the dose and the time of exposure, can be a potent toxic agent affecting macrophage phagocytosis [9, 11, 12] , resistance to MHV3-cytolysis [9] , and cell yield and viability [12] .",

[3] found that this expression of intrinsic antiviral activity of macrophages against the mouse coronavirus JHM (MHV4) correlated with the ability of the host to resist virus challenge, and possibly constituted a dominant mechanism for determining in uivo resistance to this virus. Generally, intrinsic antiviral activity of macrophages is related to the ability to either phagocytose and degrade virus, thereby rendering it non-infectious, or to adsorb virus at the cell surface and restrict replication within the cellular cytoplasm [22] . Restriction of MHV3 by activated A/J macrophages seems to be related to the latter mechanism since penetration of MI-IV3 was shown to be a phagocytosis-independent process [ 131. In addition, uptake of [3H]MHV3 by virus-activated A/J macrophages was not affected markedly by dieldrin exposure, similar to previous data of [3H]MHV3 uptake by naive, dieldrin-exposed C57B1/6 macrophages [13] .",

Since peritoneal macrophages from dieldrin-exposed, MHV3-immunized animals, or challenged in vitro with the pesticide, showed inhibition of intrinsic MHV3 restriction, at least one of these three factors must be altered by pesticide exposure. The data suggest alteration of macrophage metabolism by dieldrin, which can be comparable to the effects of X-irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. As the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the cell genome of peritoneal macrophages was extremely low due to the low frequency of dividing cells, we could only measure the effect of dieldrin on the number of proliferating cells in the macrophage population by the autoradiography technique. However, since the interaction of dieldrin with the genome of proliferating L cells was examined, and resulted in the inhibition of incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cellular DNA, we cannot exclude the possibility of dieldrin-induced inhibition of the synthesis and functioning of the resistance gene(s) product(s) in activated A/J macrophages.",

            "text": "The genetic resistance factor is of primary importance in in vivo infection with MHV3 [24] . In vivo data suggest that dieldrin does not influence the effect of genetic resistance factor(s), as dieldrinexposed A/J mice survived MHV3 infection, and only extreme virus and pesticide doses change recovery from MHV3 infection to severe disease and death [9] . Similarly, when the cellular or the humoral immune systems are crippled by such non-selective methods as whole body irradiation, treatment with anti-lymphocyte serum, or induction of graft-vs-host reaction, resistance can also be abolished [25] . Amheiter et al. [26] , in their hypothesis, emphasized the role of neutralising antibodies as a crucial factor for the increased virus spread in MHV3-infected mice of different genetic suscepbility. Dieldrin is a potent inhibitor of the humoral response, as shown by Wasserman et al. [27] . Sublethal dieldrin exposure was shown previously to inhibit anti-MHV3 IgG antibody both in serum and splenocyte culture supernatant fractions of susceptible C57B1/6 animals infected with the YAC-MHV3 virus substrain of reduced in vivo pathogenicity [9] . A marked decrease of anti-MHV3 IgG antibody was also observed in resistant A/J strain after exposure to sublethal doses of dieldrin. This might be due to depression of immunoglobulin production by secreting B cells and/or to the formation of circulating virus-antibody complexes under prolonged presence with virus. Our preliminary studies* revealed the presence of these complexes in both control-and dieldrin-exposed A/J animals and, after dissociation with NaSCN, the hidden viral antigens were found by immune reaction. These results are similar to experiments described by Neurath et al. [28] . Quantification of these immune complexes, however, showed no significant differences between dieldrin and vehicle groups. In addition, the marked decrease of anti-MHV3 IgG antibody in splenocyte culture supematant fractions after dieldrin exposure suggests rather direct inhibition of antibody-producing cell number by the pesticide. This assumption is also based upon the observation that the ratio of antibody-forming cells/ELISA in spleen cell supernatant fractions (expressing a direct relationship between the number of antibody-producing cells and the amount of secreted antibodies specific to the priming antigen) was shown to be stable in animals In cohclusion, exposure to dieldrin of the A/J mouse strain resistant to MHV3 infection decreased anti-MHV3 humoral immune response and inhibited intrinsic antiviral activity of peritoneal macrophages. This antiviral activation of macrophages does not seem to be a specific target for dieldrin action; however, it appears to be quite sensitive to the pesticide. Therefore, the dieldrin-induced inhibition of antiviral restriction by MHV3-activated macrophages can be one of the important mechanisms by which the pesticide suppresses the resistance of the host to the virus. This inhibition resulted in increased MHV3 antigen, increased damage of peritoneal macrophages and prolonged recovery from MHV3 infection in the genetically-resistant A/J mouse strain.",
