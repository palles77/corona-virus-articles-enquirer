In this project, each PGY 1 resident is required to complete a 6-month holistic healthcarecentred training programme before entering their subspecialist courses. 2 In 2006, Taiwan Association of Medical Education (TAME) helped many teaching hospitals to establish 'General Medical Training Demonstration Centres' as means of improving medical education of clinical instructors, residents and medical students. Additionally, the DOH arranged to extend the current 6-month postgraduate general medicine training programme to a 1-year programme. 3 After 2009, the DOH added a 'Training Programme for Clinical Instructors' to the 'General Medical Training' programme to help prepare the clinical instructors needed to train the more than 1300 PGY 1 residents every year during the 1-year PGY 1 programmes. 4 5 The goal of the programme is to help clinical instructors such that they have the ability to teach to PGY 1 residents the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies, including medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, system-based practice, practicebased learning and improvement, professionalism and patient care (http://www.acgme.org). 6 Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) is a regional medical centre that provides primary and tertiary care to active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents, and is the primary teaching hospital for its general medicine residency programme.",

In general, the second part of training course is designed to re-enforce the efficacy of the faculty development programme. The postcourse training workshop for clinical instructors was held with the assistance of TAME. The lectures in the training workshop emphasised teaching skills related to the competencies and lasted at least 7 h. The aims of the training workshop and videotapes were to teach and discuss the ACGME competence-related teaching and assessment skills. At the same time, we design portfolios for all participants to allow them to record and certify their training courses. Finally, TAME certificated their teaching ability according to the records within the portfolios. 9 The course can be implemented intermittently or continuously over a period of 3 months.

Patients consented to the filming, which was carried out by a professional audio visual team in actual clinical settings, including outpatient clinics and hospital wards. Three to four short video clips were produced for each patient and demonstrated the application of competencies. The average length of these clips was 2 min. The first clip usually consisted of competency-based medical consultations demonstrated by a trained physician. Subsequent clips usually consisted of the patient's physical examination and follow-up medical consultations focusing on the discussion of investigation results and treatment options. When videos were used in the 'competencies teaching skills' tutorials, no written information was given to the participants. In other words, the only materials presented to the clinical instructors were the video clips.",

Kirkpatrick has described four levels of training-programme outcomes that may be assessed. 12 This first level is a measure of the participants' initial reaction to the programme. The second level is to assess the amount of knowledge and skill that participants learnt, while the third level evaluates the amount of knowledge and skills learnt that participants actually use in everyday work. The fourth level is an evaluation of the impact of the programme on the institution and society. It has been suggested that educational institutions should develop an institutionspecific evaluation model to meet their particular needs including educational processes and outcomes. Therefore, although we chose Kirkpatrick's four level models as a guide for the evaluation, we adapted it to suit our needs. We interpreted the levels to be: Level 1dreaction, an evaluation of participants' initial attitude and familiarity with the ACGME competencies, and ability to train ACGME competencies, which is the target of our programme. These questions are included in table 1.",

In our study, we modified the third level to be the 'self-reported degree of participants' application of skills learnt from different teaching and training activities.' Furthermore, in order to validate the results of our faculty development programme effectively, a clear defi-nition of the desirable teacher's desirable behaviours needs to be given to participants in future works. The behaviours perhaps should include the following: creating an appropriate learning climate; being learnercentred; facilitating participants' learning; encouraging self-awareness through reflection; tailoring teaching to participants' needs and wants, etc. suggested by Hewson. 8 Additionally, it is well established that when one goes through an evaluation process, the evaluation process becomes more difficult and time-consuming as one moves from Kirkpatrick level 1 to level 4, although higher level provides more information than lower level, that is, of increasingly significant value than lower level. Thus, the level 4 needs to be assessed in the future for our programme. 9 12 It should be noted that, as yet, no controlled educational trials on this subject have been published, and this type of trial would be useful. 18 Finally, this study involved only a short follow-up period, and as a result, the study's findings may represent only shortterm changes in attitude, familiarity and teaching skills. 9 Despite these limitations, the present study provides information about the participants' perception of the various training sessions of our 'faculty development programme about competency for clinical instructors' designed and organised by the Taipei VGH educational committee. To date, there are no well-established standards that specifically address the competency teaching and assessment skills of clinical instructors. 21 ",
