To kill these cancer cells, we need a novel therapeutic approach other than EGFR inhibitors. If a molecule is specifically expressed on the cell surface of such EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells, it can be a therapeutic target. We found that a mesenchymal EGFR-independent subline derived from HCC827 cells, an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to a greater extent than its parental cells. ACE2 was also expressed at least partially in most of the primary EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas examined, and the ACE2 expression level in the cancer cells was much higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells. In addition, we developed an anti-ACE2 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed H8R64, that was internalized by ACE2-expressing cells. If an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized mAb based on H8R64 and a potent anticancer drug were produced, it could be effective for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas.",

Although many of these tumors initially respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), acquired resistance nearly always develops on average 1 year after the initiation of TKI therapy [1, 2] . In 5% or fewer patients with acquired resistance, the adenocarcinoma cells lose the original phenotype and display a mesenchymal phenotype instead, indicating that they have undergone epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [1e3] . We have previously demonstrated that three EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, HCC827, HCC4006, and H1975, have subpopulations of cells that have undergone EMT and can survive independently of EGFR signaling, although such cells retain the same EGFR mutation as their parental cells [4, 5] . Since these EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells never undergo apoptosis through EGFR inhibition using TKIs, such cells appear to lie at the root of TKI resistance.",

We previously developed an efficient screening method that can select mAbs internalized by target cells [7, 8] . In this screening system, a recombinant protein termed DT3C that consists of diphtheria toxin (DT) lacking the receptor-binding domain but containing the C1, C2, and C3 domains of streptococcal protein G (3C), plays a critical role.

Angiotensin II, the major effector molecule of the conventional renin-angiotensin system, is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction, whereas ACE2 and its product angiotensin 1-7 are thought to prevent the detrimental effects of angiotensin II [9] . In respiratory organs, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [10, 11] . However, ACE2 has also been shown to attenuate inflammation and/or acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV infection, influenza virus infection, or other etiologies mainly through inhibition of angiotensin IImediated NF-kB signaling [11e16] . As expected from the fact that ACE2 acts as the receptor for SARS-CoV, it has been reported to be localized to the apical membrane of respiratory epithelial cells, including alveolar epithelia [10] . As far as we are aware, no studies are available on ACE2 expression in EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. In addition, ACE2 seems to be only expressed at low levels in normal lung and lung cancer tissues according to the Human Protein Atlas [17] .",

In addition we developed a new anti-ACE2 mouse mAb (H8R64) that was internalized by target cells. If an ADC consisting of a humanized mAb based on H8R64 and a potent anticancer drug were produced, the new ADC could be effective for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas containing TKI-resistant cells.",

We found that ACE2 was expressed to a greater degree in TKI-resistant, EGFR-mutant HCC827 GR2 cells with an EMT phenotype than in their parental cells. If an ADC consisting of a humanized mAb based on H8R64 and a potent anticancer drug were produced, the new ADC could induce cell death efficiently only in cancer cells expressing ACE2. If HCC4006 GR3 cells and H1975 WR7 cells, mesenchymal EGFRmutant lung adenocarcinoma sublines, expressed ACE2, we could see it as a promising therapeutic target to fully eradicate EGFRmutant cancer cells. Unfortunately, neither of these two sublines expressed ACE2. However, we have also demonstrated in this study that TKI-na\u00efve EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma tissues mostly express ACE2 at least partially, and that the expression levels of ACE2 in carcinoma cells appears to be higher than those in normal lung bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells. These findings suggest that ADCs incorporating anti-ACE2 mAb could induce cell death in EGFR-mutated cancer cells more efficiently than in normal lung epithelia. It remains to be established whether ACE2-positive EGFRmutant lung cancer cells resist EGFR-TKIs and survive TKI treatment.",
