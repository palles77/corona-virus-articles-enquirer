            "text": "Aim of the study: To elucidate the anticomplementary principles of a Chinese multiherb remedy used for the treatment and prevention of SARS, which contains five ingredients of Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici, Herba Artemisiae Scopariae, Herba Eupatorii and Fructus Tsaoko. Materials and methods: The anticomplementary activity was evaluated from hemolytic assays through the classical pathway (CP) and the alternative pathway (AP) of complement system in vitro. Compounds were isolated using bioactivity-guided fractionation and tested in vitro for their complement-inhibiting properties on the CP and AP. HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS was used to assign the isolated compounds in the five ingredient herbs. Results: 15 compounds, including chlorogenic acid (1), rutin (2), hyperoside (3), p-hydroxyacephenone (4), scopoletin (5), quercitrin (6) (3R,4R,6S)-3,6-dihydroxy-1-menthene (7), acaciin (8), scoparone (9), luteolin (10), quercetin (11), apigenin (12), acacetin (13), aristolactam (14), and apigenin-7,4 -dimethyl ether (15) were isolated and identified. Nine flavonoids (2, 3, 6, 8, 10-13, 15 ) were found to show inhibitory effects towards the CP and AP of complement system, luteolin (10) was the most potent with the CH 50 and AP 50 values of 0.19 and 0.17 mM. The bioactive flavonoids were mainly derived from Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici and Herba Artemisiae Scopariae. Conclusions: A Chinese multiherb remedy used for the treatment and prevention of SARS has robust inhibitory effect on complement system through the CP and AP, and its anticomplementary activity could be attributed to the flavonoids present in some ingredient herbs. Luteolin could be a potential anticomplementary agent.",

            "text": "The complement system plays a crucial role in the elimination of invading pathogens and generation of an optimal host response. It can be activated by a cascade mechanism of the classical pathway (CP), alternative pathway (AP), or the lectin pathway (Carroll and Fischer, 1997) . However, a wealth of data has clearly demonstrated that undesired activation of complement is responsible for the initiation, amplification or perpetuation of tissue damage and inflammation in a number of pathological situations (Morgan and Harris, 2003) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an emerging infectious disease with severe mortality, affected many countries in 2003 and the coronavirus is the etiologic agent (Peiris et al., 2003) . In terms of pathogenesis of SARS, viral load in the first phase may in turn result in host inflammatory response during the second phase. The SARS complications are associated with severe inflammatory tissue destruction due to excessive activation of the innate immune system and a notable proportion of the patients progressed to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in the later phase of viral infection (Li et al., 2003) . Considerable clinical and experimental evidence implicated that complement appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of these late post-viral complications, which could even be predicted by increased complement activations (Sahu and Lambris, 2000; Abe, 2006; Sarma et al., 2006) . Hence, antiviral agents combined with inhibition of complement cascade reaction may represent an attractive and efficient therapeutic strategy for SARS.",

A multiherb remedy, which contains five ingredients of Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici, Herba Artemisiae Scopariae, Herba Eupatorii, and Fructus Tsaoko, was recommended for the treatment and prevention of SARS by State Administration of TCM of the People's Republic of China. According to TCM, Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici, and Herba Artemisiae Scopariae have functions of eliminating evil-heat and detoxification; Herba Eupatorii and Fructus Tsaoko are commonly used for dispersing dampness. Pharmacological experiments showed that these five-ingredient herbs possess direct inhibitory activity against virus, bacteria, and inflammation (Hayashi et al., 1995; Sun et al., 1995; Moon et al., 2004; Xie et al., 2004; Cheng et al., 2005) .",

Bioactivity-guided fractionation showed that the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction had significant anticomplementary activity. Further chromatographic separation of the active fraction led to the isolation of 15 compounds, including 9 flavonoids, 2 coumarins, 1 alkaloid, 1 monoterpene, 1 organic acid and 1 ketone. Flavonoids were found to show significant inhibitory effect towards the CP and AP of complement system.

The bioactivity-guided fractionation indicated that the petroleum ether fraction resulted in haemolysis of the sheep and rabbit erythrocytes at higher concentrations of 1.38 and 0.83 mg/mL, respectively. According to the results of lysis control without serum, both the ethanolic extract and the petroleum ether fraction definitely induced lysis when the doses for the assay were exceedingly large. The EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions inhibited both the CP and AP of complement system in a dose-dependent manner. The EtOAc fraction showed a more pronounced complement inhibition than the n-BuOH fraction, as measured by the diminished haemolysis of sensitized erythrocytes in the presence of complement factors (Fig. 1, Table 1 ). Thus, it was concluded that the main anticomplementary principles were enriched in the EtOAc fraction.

Table 2 The retention times (t R ) and ESI-MS data in the positive ion mode (m/z) of compounds 1-15 The newly developed HPLC-DAD-MS assay was subsequently applied for simultaneous identification of compounds 1-15 in five-ingredient herbs. The representative chromatograms of the five herbs were shown in Fig. 4 . The 15 compounds of the analyzed samples were identified by comparing the retention times, UV spectra and MS data with those obtained from the reference substances (Fig. 3, Table 2 ), as well as by spiking samples with the reference compounds. The analysis confirmed the presence of compounds 1-3, 6, 8, 10-15 in Herba Houttuyniae with different contents . Compounds 1, 3,  8, 10-13, and 15 were detected in Flos Chrysanthemi Indici and compounds 1, 4, 5, 6, 9-13, and 15 were found in Herba Artemisiae Scopariae. Meanwhile, compounds 4, 7, and compounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 13 , and 15 could be detected in Herba Eupatorii and Fructus Tsaoko, respectively (Table 3) . According to the literatures (Haruna et al., 1986; Chu et al., 2004; Xie et al., 2004; Jiang and Gao, 2005; Xu et al., 2006) , a plenty of flavonoids were present in Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici, and Herba Artemisiae Scopariae while sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes were distributed in Herba Eupatorii, which were in good agreement with the results of HPLC-DAD-MS analysis. Although there were few reports on flavonoids obtained from Fructus Tsaoko, several flavonoids were detected in the methanolic extract of Fructus Tsaoko with MS detector in the SIM mode in our investigation. Therefore, further isolation and NMR elucidation would be very helpful to confirm the presence of these flavonoids in Fructus Tsaoko.",
