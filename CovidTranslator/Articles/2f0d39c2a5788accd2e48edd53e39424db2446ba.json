            "text": "For centuries, Muslim pilgrims have converged in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for the Hajj to participate in a series of sacred rituals at least once in their life. With more than 1.5 billion Muslims scattered in 183 countries worldwide, Hajj has become the largest annually recurring mass gathering event with more than 2.5 million participants, mostly middle aged or older, many with co-morbidities [1] . As for other mass gatherings, Hajj' hazards are classified as noncommunicable (stampede, cardiovascular) and communicable. Almost a decade after the first pandemic of the 21st century caused by the SARS coronavirus, the identification of the novel MERS coronavirus in Saudi Arabia, in June 2012, has raised considerable concern about possible globalization. The Neisseria meningitidis W135 outbreak at the outset of the 21st century was an example of the epidemiological \"amplifying chamber\" that the Hajj has become.",

Pneumonia is the most common cause of infection followed by upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, skin infections and sepsis [2] . Responsible for almost 60% of the total, respiratory infections are the most prominent infections occurring during Hajj and are a common cause of severe sepsis and septic shock, necessitating intensive care. With an approximate 20% fatality rate, complications resulting from pneumonia are responsible for the second (after cardiovascular disease accounting for >40%) largest number of deaths during Hajj [3] . In 2014, one million Hajj' pilgrims will experience respiratory symptoms. Accordingly, dissemination of viral or bacterial respiratory pathogens secondary to symptomatic infections or carriage emphasizes the need for international cooperation and strategies to minimize this risk.",

Although diagnostic may appear as a trivial problem that is already being solved, the real-life situation is less glamorous. Laboratory tests allowing the direct and rapid detection of various micro-organisms potentially causing a similar syndrome are sometimes available from commercial companies but are unaffordable for broad utilisation in low income countries. In addition shortages are frequent at the peak of the crisis [7, 8] . The rapid production of properly validated assays that can be used on common real-time PCR cyclers at an affordable cost is far from taken for granted although the proof of concept has been validated through the European Virus Archive, a EU-funded infrastructure [9] (www. european-virus-archive.com).",
