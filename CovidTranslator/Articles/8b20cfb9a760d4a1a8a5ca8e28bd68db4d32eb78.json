Influenza and parainfluenza viruses, syncytial respiratory virus, herpes viruses and adenovirures are the most frequent causes of these severe infections. A review of the literature has been performed in order to update the epidemiology, pathogenesis and therapeutic approach of viral infections affecting immunocompetent patients. Furthermore, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in intensive care units and has a high morbidity and mortality rate. It is mainly a bacterial disease, although the potential role of viruses as pathogens or copathogens in VAP is under discussion. Therefore, a brief review of the potential pathogenic role of viruses in VAP has also been performed.",

The diagnosis is established by PCR and immunofluorescence, though viral cultures and ELISA can also be used. Treatment is fundamentally supportive, and in some cases corticosteroids can prove useful (following the development of ARDS). The reported mortality rate is about 11%, and is greater in patients over 65 years of age. Transmission is via droplets, the aerial route and contact. The clinical picture is characterized by prodromic manifestations (fever, chills, muscle pain, abdominal pain) and rapid progression towards respiratory failure, ARDS, coagulopathy and shock. The diagnosis is based on serological tests. Treatment comprises supportive measures and the administration of ribavirin in HFRS (not effective in HCPS).

Amantadine is effective against influenza A virus, but not against influenza B virus (the latter lacks protein M2, and instead has a substituting protein called NB that is not affected by amantadine). On the other hand, oseltamivir (Tamiflu \u00ae ) and zanamivir (Relenza \u00ae ) block the active site of neuraminidase, thus preventing the spread of the virus.

The non-pharmacological management 3 of critical patients with serious febrile respiratory illness varies according to the implicated infectious agent (suspected or confirmed) and the severity of the respiratory condition -though most cases present clinical similarities allowing us to establish a certain management pattern. Thus, in all cases intensive supportive measures are necessary (fluids, amines, renal replacement therapy), such as those used in septic shock of other origins. These patients usually suffer serious lung injuries, thus leading to the need for mechanical ventilation. In cases where ARDS has developed, protective strategies must be applied to mechanical ventilation (low tidal volume [6 ml/ kg], high PEEP values to reduce atelectasic areas). The more milder cases sometimes respond favorably to early noninvasive ventilation (NIV), though there is controversy over the use of this technique in such patients.",

The isolated viruses were rhinovirus, herpes simples, influenza, respiratory syncytial, enterovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, coronavirus and CMV, detected in 25% of the patients. No cases of attributable viral pneumonia were identified in the VAP episodes, though it must be mentioned that herpes simplex virus type I (HSVI) was isolated in 31% of the VAP episodes. Therefore, HSVI appears as the most likely implicated viral agent, as also suggested by a recent national series 11 and by several international studies published in the last decade.

Eleven years later, these same authors, based on in vivo biopsies in a population of 100 patients, demonstrated a high incidence of CMV pneumonia (30%) and a low diagnostic yield for both PCR and BAL sample culture (sensitivity 53% and specificity 92%). 28 In a recent study, the incidence of active CMV disease was found to be high in a series of 242 immunocompetent patients subjected to ventilation for over 48 hours (16.1%) . 20 In view of the above, CMV should be suspected as the cause of VAP in the presence of persistent infiltrates, a lack of clinical improvement and negative bacterial cultures -using PCR to evaluate the possibility of CMV reactivation.

The diagnosis is generally based on the clinical manifestations, though complementary techniques can be of help, such as antigen determination tests, nucleic acid tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification or viral cultures. The drug treatment options include neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir), which are preferred to amantadine and rimantadine, due to the important existence of resistances to the latter. The role of the latest H1N1 virus pandemic will not be examined in this review, since we feel that its complexity and characteristics require an exhaustive description such as that being carried out by the study group created to the effect by our Society (SEMICYUC).",
