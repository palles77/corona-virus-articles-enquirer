This study evaluated plasma proteomic profiling via an N-terminal isotope tagging strategy coupled with liquid chromatography/Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry measurement to detect liver fibrosis staging. Pooled plasma from different liver fibrosis stages, which were assessed in advance by the current gold-standard of liver biopsy, was quantitatively analyzed. A total of 72 plasma proteins were found to be dysregulated during the fibrogenesis process, and this finding constituted a valuable candidate plasma biomarker bank for follow-up analysis. Validation results of fibronectin by Western blotting reconfirmed the mass-based data. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis showed four types of metabolic networks for the functional effect of liver fibrosis disease in chronic hepatitis B patients. Consequently, quantitative proteomics via the N-terminal acetyl isotope labeling technique provides an effective and useful tool for screening plasma candidate biomarkers for liver fibrosis. We quantitatively monitored the fibrogenesis process in CHB patients. We discovered many new valuable candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and also partly identified the mechanism involved in liver fibrosis disease. These results provide a clearer understanding of liver fibrosis pathophysiology and will also hopefully lead to improvement of clinical diagnosis and treatment. quantitative proteomics, liver fibrosis, biomarker, plasma, hepatitis B virus Citation:",

Liver fibrosis is a common response to CHB infection and might result in potentially lethal sequelae, which progress to cirrhosis in 12%-20% of patients, and compensated cirrhosis progresses to hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma within five years in 20%-25% and 6%-16% of patients, respectively. Approximately 250000 deaths occur each year worldwide as a consequence of fulminant hepatic failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1, 2] . Liver disease is not an incurable disease, because liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are reversible, and accurate diagnosis is crucial for evaluation of the sever-ity of the disease, for treatment decisions, and for assessing drug efficacy [3] . Clinically, it is always difficult to make a noninvasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Liver biopsy is currently the gold-standard procedure for assessing the degree of fibrosis, but it has several disadvantages such as costly procedures, poor patient compliance, discomfort for the patient, the risk of poorly standardized collection of liver tissues, and limited usefulness for dynamic surveillance and follow-up. Considering these limitations, accurate and reliable noninvasive methods to assess the severity of hepatic fibrosis are urgently needed [4] .",

The N-terminal acetyl isotope (d0/d6) labeling technique shows great potential in biomarker detection with its high-throughput identification and accurate quantification of proteins, as well as being a simple procedure.

Five fibrosis stages were determined using Scheuer's classification [10] : stage 0 (F0), no fibrosis; stage 1 (F1), enlarged fibrotic portal tracts; stage 2 (F2), periportal or portal-portal septa, but intact architecture; stage 3 (F3), fibrosis with architectural distortion, but no obvious cirrhosis; and stage 4 (F4), cirrhosis. Liver fibrosis was considered significant when it spread beyond the portal tract (stages 2, 3, or 4), whereas it was considered insignificant when it was absent or restricted to the portal tract (stages 0 or 1, respectively).

The d0-acetylation (+42.0106 Da) and d3-acetylation (+45.0294 Da) of the peptide N-terminus, guanidination of the lysine residue (+42.0218 Da), and cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0214 Da) were set as fixed modifications. The maximal allowable miss-cleavage sites were two, and the mass tolerances for peptide and fragment ions were 1.5\u00d710 \u22125 and 1.0 Da, respectively. There was at least 95% confidence that each identified peptide had a score greater than 27. Each identified protein had at least one unique positive peptide that was not shared with any other protein. Based on the mascot results, the monoisotopic peak ratio between the heavy-labeled peptides and the light-labeled peptides was automatically calculated by a graphic user interface program called \"mass spectrometry quantification with acetylation labeling\" (MSAQ) [13] developed in house. The basic quantitative information was from the intensities of the pair of parent ions of the light-or heavy-labeled peptides in the MS full scans. The peptide pairs were accurately extracted by matching the m/z of the parent ion with the peaks in the MS full scan around the MS/MS scan time, and the intensity ratio of the labeled peptide pairs was computed. Because the 4th isotopic peak of the light-labeled peptide might overlap with the monoisotopic peak of the heavy-labeled peptide, especially when the mass is greater than 1500 Da, the observed ratio could be larger than the true ratio. According to the theory that isotopic distribution can be calculated by a polynomial algorithm, the overlapping portion was subtracted. After the steps mentioned above, the mean and standard deviation of the ratios of the pairs of each peptide were calculated and used as the final quantitative ratio of the peptide. To maintain data quality, the minimal signal/noise (S/N) of the pairs was set to greater than two, which was read from the *.raw file by the Xcalibur Development Kit (XDK) API function.",

An integrated test or fingerprinting with many differential proteins identified in this study may better reflect a patient's status than one marker alone. For example, haptoglobin, hemoglobin, and IGLC (immunoglobulin-free light chains) may be coupled together when LF diagnosis, which should be more reliable for liver fibrosis diagnosis. Many other proteins could also be detected in parallel in follow-up analysis. However, many candidate proteins found in this study have no commercially available kits for their detection. Therefore, protein-chip technology [69, 70] or multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry technology [71] could possibly be performed simultaneously in a single experiment, to detect and quantify specific proteins or peptides in plasma of patients with liver fibrosis to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis. A number of studies have shown the feasibility of such an approach [72] .",

The gradient was 15%-40% B for 80 min and 40%-100% B for 15 min. One FT full MS scan was followed by five data-dependent LTQ MS/MS scans on the five most intense ions. The dynamic exclusion time was 45 s. Ions were accumulated in a linear ion trap controlled by the automatic gain control. The automatic gain control values were 5\u00d7105 charges for the FT full MS scan and 1\u00d7104 charges for the LTQ MS/MS scan. The resolution was 10000 for a FT full MS scan at 400 m/z. The temperature of the ion transfer tube was set at 200\u00b0C and the spray voltage was set at 1.8 kV. The isolation width was 4 Da and normalized collision energy was 35% for the MS/MS scan. Mass spectra were acquired over the mass range from 400 to 2000 m/z.",
