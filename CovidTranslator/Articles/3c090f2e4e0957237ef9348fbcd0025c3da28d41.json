            "text": "To investigate methods for identifying specific cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibitors derived from quinoxaline, thus developing possible lead compounds to inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore opening. Methods: Kinetic analysis of the CypD/inhibitor interaction was quantitatively performed by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and fluorescence titration (FT) techniques. IC 50 values of these inhibitors were determined by PPIase inhibition activity assays. Results: All the equilibrium dissociation constants (K D ) of the seven compounds binding to CypD were below 10 \u00b5mol/L. The IC 50 values were all consistent with the SPR and FT results. Compounds GW2, 5, 6, and 7 had high inhibition activities against Ca 2+ -dependent rat liver mitochondrial swelling and Ca 2+ uptake/release. Compound GW5 had binding selectivity for CypD over CypA. Conclusion: The agreement between the measured IC 50 values and the results of SPR and FT suggests that these methods are appropriate and powerful methods for identifying CypD inhibitors. The compounds we screened using these methods (GW1-7) are reasonable CypD inhibitors. Its potent ability to inhibit mitochondrial swelling and the binding selectivity of GW5 indicates that GW5 could potentially be used for inhibiting MPT pore opening.",

Mitochondria release apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) into the cytosol, which are involved in the signaling pathway of caspases and induce cell apoptosis [1] [2] [3] . One major pathway of the release of the apoptogenic factors to the cytosol is via the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane due to mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore opening [3] . It is suggested that MPT pores play a potent role in cell aging [4, 5] , and opening of the MPT pores may cause changes in mitochondrial shape and function, such as the massive swelling of mitochondria, rupture of the outer membrane and release of inter-membrane components that induce apoptosis. It has been reported that the agents that inhibit MPT may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of human diseases such as ischemiareperfusion injury in peripheral organs, trauma and neurodegenerative diseases [5] [6] [7] .",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that the MPT pore is composed of three major proteins: the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the outer membrane that forms a large H 2 O-filled pore with a diameter of 2.5-3.0 nm, the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) that mediates the ADP-ATP exchange in the inner membrane, and cyclophilin D (CypD) [8] . CypD belongs to the family of highly homologous peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) that are thought to be important for protein folding, and can bind to the immunosuppressor cyclosporin A (CSA) [9, 10] . It is known that CypD is a mitochondrial-targeted PPIase, even though its specific physiological role is largely obscure [11, 12] . CypD has been confirmed to play a decisive role in MPT pore regulation, and PPIase activity of CypD might be a necessary step in MPT pore opening [8, 13] . A model was recently proposed concerning the mechanism of permeability transition-related cytochrome c release, whereby the Ca 2+ requirement for the induction of the MPT pore opening might be due to the Ca 2+ -dependent interaction between CypD and ANT [14] [15] [16] . It has been reported that CypD inhibitor CSA and its analogues may block MPT pore opening [17, 18] , which thereby makes discovering the CypD inhibitor an appealing project. However, to our knowledge, investigating the small molecular CypDspecific inhibitor for allowing brain penetration is still a challenge.",

The sequence similarity identity between CypD and CypA was 63%, and positives were 81%, making the Protein Data Bank (PDB) of human CypA an ideal template for CypD 3-D model building. The 3-D model of the TrpRS was generated based on PDB templates 1AK4 [29] , 1AWT [30] , and 1NMK [31] retrieved from the Protein DataBase by using the MODELLER program [32] encoded in Insight II [33] . MODELLER uses a spatial restraint method to build up 3-D protein models. The structure of each template protein was used to derive spatial restraints expressed as probability density functions for each of the restrained features of the models. The structure with the lowest violation score and lowest energy score was chosen as the candidate. Refinements of the routine in the Homology module of Insight II were used to adjust the positions of the side chains.

During the assay, a 1:1 ratio of CypD(A) to binding compound was used based on published information about CypA/CSA interactions [39, 40] and the results of our molecular docking analyses. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ') used for evaluating CypD(A) binding affinity to the tested compound was calculated according to the method in the literature [23] . We assumed that a 50% occupancy of CypD (or CypA) is set at a fractional fluorescence change of 0.5 (FC 0.5 ), and at this point the concentration of the bound ligand is equal to that of the bound protein, which is half of the total concentration of protein. Accordingly, K D ' is equal to the total ligand concentration minus the concentration of the bound protein at FC 0.5 [23] . Figure 3 shows the typical tryptophan fluorescence quenching of CypD induced by titration of the tested compounds with an increase in their concentration. Since none of the compounds showed any intrinsic fluorescence absorption, their possible effects on the experiments could be discounted (data not shown). The K D ' values of GW1-7 are summarized in Table 2 . Obviously, the binding selectivity of GW5 for CypD over CypA could also be determined, and the K D ' values are very comparable to the K D values determined by the Biacore assay.",

These pores allow solutes of <1500 Da in size across the inner mitochondrial membrane, leading to mitochondrial swelling. Such swelling can be detected by time scans of absorbance at 540 nm (A 540 ) and the extent of swelling is proportional to A 540 [26] . Fluo-5N fluorescence is quite low without binding to Ca 2+ in controls, because the high mitochondrial membrane potential prevents the release of endogenous mitochondrial Ca 2+ . When exogenous Ca 2+ was added, Fluo-5N fluorescence increased immediately and decreased rapidly as Ca 2+ ions were taken up into the mitochondria. Subsequently, the accumulation of cations in the mitochondria led to mitochondrial swelling and depolarization. Ca 2+ ions were then released from mitochondria as a consequence of the onset of MPT, as indicated by an increase in Fluo-5N fluorescence. Ca 2+ release was completely blocked by 1 \u00b5mol/L CSA. Fluo-5N fluorescence also revealed that compounds GW1-7 inhibited the uptake/release of exogenously added Ca 2+ to a certain extent. Figure 5A shows the results of the rat mitochondrial swelling inhibition assay for GW1-7 (100 \u00b5mol/L) with CSA (1 \u00b5mol/L) as a control. Figure 5B gives the results of the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake/release inhibition assay for GW1-7 (100 \u00b5mol/L). The results show that the inhibition abilities of compounds GW1-7 against Ca 2+ uptake/release are in good agreement with their inhibition abilities against mitochondrial swelling. We found that compounds GW2, 5, 6, and 7 had a strong ability, whereas GW1, 3, and 4 did not have any inhibition activity, which could be because of the R group. Compared with GW2, 5, 6, and 7, the tails of GW1, 3, and 4 were ethoxycarbonyl, which might prevent them from transferring into mitochondria through the membranes or cause the loss of inhibition ability for other (unclear) reasons. The behavior of CypD in mitochondria is much more complicated than that of the purified CypD protein, so the different R groups might cause different results. CSA had the highest inhibition activity, and the relative general inhibition abilities of the other compounds were: GW5>GW7>GW6>GW2. Such a sequence seems to be consistent with the CypD PPIase inhibition ability of the compounds (Table 3) . This result thus confirms the fact that CypD inhibitors may possess possible inhibition activity against Ca 2+ -dependent MPT pore opening.",

Because of the similar structures of the compounds, they share the same precursor, with some overlapping structural elements in common ( Figure 6B ). Similar to CypA, the binding pocket of CypD is also fairly large and shallow, and is composed of residues Arg58, Ile60, Phe63, Met64, Glu66, Gly75, Thr76, Gly77, Ala104, Asn105, Ala106, Gln114, Phe116, Thr122, Trp124, Leu125, Lys128, and His129. GW1-7 and CSA bind to the same binding site of CypD. Unlike the case of full occupation by CSA, GW1-7 occupied only part of the binding pocket and might swing in the pocket. Helekar and Patrick even demonstrated that Arg55 of CypA was a key determinant against PPIase activity [42] . Compounds GW1-7 showed their hydrophobic contact with Arg58 of CypD (Arg55 of CypA). Therefore, the PPIase activity of CypD could be inhibited by hydrophobic interactions with the inhibitors. In addition, GW1-7 formed stacking interactions with Trp124 of CypD (Trp121 of CypA) and the only tryptophan residues of CypD and CypA that contribute to the change in fluorescence intensity (data not shown ).",

In vitro assays indicated that compounds GW2, 5, 6, and 7 inhibit Ca 2+ -dependent rat liver mitochondrial swelling and Ca 2+ uptake/ release. By using SPR and fluorescence titration techniques, kinetic analysis of CypD/inhibitor interactions were quantitatively performed. The measured IC 50 values for the tested compounds are all in good agreement with the SPR and fluorescence titration results, which suggests that these are powerful methods for identifying CypD inhibitors [38] . Further studies indicated that GW5 has binding selectivity for CypD over CypA.",
