For example, mental health professionals, social workers, nursing home administrators, and volunteers should deliver mental health care for people living with dementia collaboratively. Within such a team, dementia experts could take the lead and support team members from other disciplines. Self-help guidance for reducing stress, such as relaxation or meditation exercise, could be delivered through electronic media. Service teams could support behavioural management through telephone hotlines. Psychological counsellors could provide online consultation for carers at home and in nursing homes. 11 In addition, we encourage people who have a parent with dementia to have more frequent contact or spend more time with their parent, or to take on some of the caregiving duties so as to give the carer some respite time.",

We believe that learning lessons from China would empower the world to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, with little risk of compro mising the quality of life of people living with dementia and their carers. HW Older adults are vulnerable at the onset of natural disasters and crisis, and this has been especially true during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 1 With the aggressive spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the death toll has risen worldwide. According to an interactive online tool that estimates the potential number of deaths from COVID-19 in a population, by age group, in individual countries and regional groupings worldwide under a range of scenarios, most of those who have died were older adults, most of whom had underlying health problems. 2 Globally, more than 50 million people have dementia, and one new case occurs every 3 s. 3 Dementia has emerged as a pandemic in an ageing society. 4 The double hit of dementia and COVID-19 pandemics has raised great concerns for people living with dementia.",

Group activities in nursing homes were also prohibited. As a consequence, the residents of nursing homes became more socially isolated. We have observed that under the dual stress of fear of infection and worries about the residents' condition, the level of anxiety among staff in nursing homes increased and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout after a month-long full lockdown of the facilities.",
