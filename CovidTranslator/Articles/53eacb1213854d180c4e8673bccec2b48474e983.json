The virus might reactivate after years of latency and lyse oligodendrocytes, as in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or initiate immunopathological demyelination, as in animals infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus or coronaviruses. The argument for a viral cause of MS is supported by epidemiological analyses and studies of MS in identical twins, indicating that disease is acquired. However, the most important evidence is the presence of bands of oligoclonal IgG (OCBs) in MS brain and CSF that persist throughout the lifetime of the patient. OCBs are found almost exclusively in infectious CNS disorders, and antigenic targets of OCBs represent the agent that causes disease. Here, the authors review past attempts to identify an infectious agent in MS brain cells and discuss the promise of using recombinant antibodies generated from clonally expanded plasma cells in brain and CSF to identify disease-relevant antigens. They show how this strategy has been used successfully to analyze antigen specificity in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a chronic encephalitis caused by measles virus, and in neuromyelitis optica, a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease produced by antibodies directed against the aquaporin-4 water channel.",

Approximately 300,000 to 400,000 Americans are affected, resulting in more than 3000 deaths per year with an estimated annual morbidity cost of more than $2.5 billion. Most patients are young adults. Disease begins between ages 15 and 45 years and has a relapsing-remitting course, although a substantial proportion of patients develop chronic progressive disease. The pathologic hallmark of MS is the plaque, an area of white matter demyelination, often inflammatory. Active plaques consist of mononuclear cell infiltrates concentrated in perivascular spaces composed of T cells, B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. Demyelination is widely considered to be the product of an immune-mediated pathology in which Th1 and Th17 CD4 + T cells promote a CNS inflammatory response. Myelin destruction may also occur in the absence of lymphocytic infiltration, suggesting a role for",

Indeed, successful use of such rAbs derived from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a chronic encephalitis caused by measles virus (MV), and from patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease produced by antibodies directed against the aquaporin-4 water channel, provides proof of principle that these reagents can serve in identifying antigen specificity in diseases that reveal molecular and immunologic features similar to those of MS.

Epidemiologic analysis of MS cases in the Faroe Islands from 1920 to 1977 indicated a point-source epi-demic, probably introduced by the British troops or their baggage (Kurtzke and Hyllested 1979) . Studies of identical twins discordant for MS have shown that only 30% of the other twins develop disease, suggesting that more than a putative susceptible genome determines disease (Spielman and Nathanson 1982) . Similarly, in a mouse model of demyelination produced by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), there are genetic components that are critical for disease susceptibility. For example, TMEV infection produces demyelination in SJL/J mice but not in C57/Bl mice. Recently, analysis of the mRNA transcriptome and epigenome sequences of CD4 + lymphocytes from three sets of MS-discordant, monozygotic twins revealed no reproducible differences that explained disease discordance (Baranzini and others 2010) . Furthermore, there are no genetic disorders in which the brain and CSF contain oligoclonal IgG (OCBs). Therefore, the high risk of MS in siblings and twins most likely reflects virus infection superimposed on a susceptible genetic background.",

            "text": "An important clue to understanding the cause of MS is provided by the lifelong presence in these patients of OCBs and the elevated IgG proportions of CSF protein (15%-30% or more compared to \u226413% in normal human CSF). Ig is predominately IgG 1 k and, unlike the heterogeneous distribution of polyclonal Ig observed in normal CSF, resolves as discrete IgG bands when separated by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (Link and Laurenzi 1979) . OCBs in CSF are detected in 88% to 100% of MS patients and remain a sensitive laboratory test that supports the clinical diagnosis. In other chronic CNS infectious disorders, such as neurosyphilis, tubercu-lous meningitis, fungal meningitis, and SSPE, the OCBs are antibodies directed against the agent that causes disease. The classic article by Vandvik and others (1976) demonstrating that nearly all the oligoclonal IgG in SSPE CSF and brain is directed against MV was followed by the demonstration that OCBs in the CSF of patients with cryptococcal meningitis are antibodies directed against cryptococcal antigen (Porter and others 1977) and that the oligoclonal IgG antibody in the CSF of patients with neurosyphilis is directed against Treponema palladium (Vartdal and others 1982) . Table 1 lists multiple CNS diseases of humans and two examples of demyelination produced by experimental infection of mice with picorna-viruses and coronaviruses, respectively, in which the oligoclonal IgG in CSF is directed against the agent that causes disease. Because oligoclonal IgG is seen almost exclusively in CNS disorders of infectious origin and because the antigenic targets of the OCBs are directed against the agent that causes disease, it is likely that MS is also triggered by an agent against which the antibody response in the brain and CSF is directed. Furthermore, the antibody in MS might be immunopathologic, although there is no evidence that this is the case in any other chronic CNS disease in which OCBs are present. In fact, there is substantial evidence that the humoral response reflected in the oligoclonal IgG is not directed against myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), or myelin-oligodendrocyte protein (MOG), autoantigens capable of inducing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). This does not exclude the possibility, however, of a cell-mediated immunopathology after virus infection.",

Not surprisingly, attempts to produce an infectious model of demyelination by experimental infection of rodents with JC virus failed.

Although sufficient quantities of brain cells were obtained from patients with MS, the neurons did not survive subcultivation in tissue culture (Wroblewska and others 1975) . In alternative approaches, brain cells were both cocultivated and fused with MS brain cells in an attempt to obtain a cytopathic effect (CPE) produced by an infectious agent. After cell fusion using lysolecithin or polyethylene glycol, cells were observed for a CPE and examined by immunofluorescence for binding to antibodies directed against various DNA and RNA viruses. Explanted and fused MS brain cells were also inoculated into embryonated hen eggs, rodent species, and chimpanzees in additional attempts to produce neurologic disease. An MS-specific agent was not found. Interestingly, inoculation of MS brain into mice resulted in activation of an endogenous mouse virus (the WW strain of TMEV) that produced demyelination (Wroblewska and others 1977) .

A pseudotype virus contains the genome of one virus and the protein coat of a second virus and may be produced by cells in tissue culture containing an enveloped virus after superinfection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The presence of a pseudotype virus is readily detected based on a small fraction of virus that is resis-tant to antibody against VSV but neutralized by antibody directed against the second virus (Gilden and others 1981) . MS brain cells in tissue culture were infected with VSV, harvested when CPE appeared, and assayed for a VSV nonneutralizing fraction; however, no enveloped virus latent in MS brain cells was discovered.",

Resident antibody-producing cells can be identified with the phenotype-specific markers indicative of B lymphocytes (CD20) or plasmablasts/plasma cells (CD38 or CD138) ( Fig. 3 ; Burgoon and others 2005) . These cells are the likely source of the restricted OCB pattern seen in CSF, but not in serum, of affected individuals. Individual B lymphocytes and plasma cells can be isolated from the parenchyma of postmortem SSPE brains by laser-capture microdissection or from SSPE CSF by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. After reverse transcription of the RNA in detergent lysates from single plasma cells, the variable region of IgG sequences can be PCR amplified to identify the sequence of the functional antibody that is expressed. By collecting and analyzing large numbers of cells, a representative repertoire of the intrathecal IgG expressed in each SSPE patient is obtained (Burgoon and others 2005; Owens, Ritchie, and others 2007) . Normally, no two antibody sequences are identical between patients. However, in SSPE brain and CSF, many plasma cells are composed of clonally expanded populations that express the same or closely related IgGs. IgGs expressed in SSPE brain and CSF are somatically mutated from their corresponding germline sequence, most of which are distinct from the immune response seen in the serum of the same patients. All these features of antigen-driven selection are also observed in the B lymphocyte and plasma cell repertoires isolated from MS CSF (Owens and others 2003; Ritchie and others 2004) .",

From the plasma cell repertoire of a single SSPE brain, the heavy-chain variable regions of eight clonally expanded plasma cell populations were cloned into mammalian expression vectors that already contained the appropriate constant regions and leader sequences needed to synthesize an intact IgG1 heavy chain. The corresponding light chains (\u03ba or \u03bb) identified from the same SSPE plasma cells were also cloned into mammalian expression vectors. After cotransfection of the heavy and light chains into mammalian HEK293 cells, intact human IgG was synthesized and secreted into the culture medium from which a monoclonal rAb was purified. Analysis of eight rAbs from clonally expanded plasma cell populations revealed that five reacted specifically with the nucleocapsid protein of MV, the cause of disease. These rAbs also identified MV antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as well as by protein immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunostaining of MV-infected cells. By expressing the FLAG epitope (Hopp and others 1988) at the carboxyl terminus of the rAbs, we also showed that despite the presence of native human IgG, these anti-MV rAbs detected their corresponding antigens in SSPE brain (Burgoon and others 2005) . The dominant reactivity of the rAbs to MV nucleocapsid protein reflected the same prevalence seen during natural MV infection and in SSPE (Norrby and Gollmar 1972; Lin and others 1982) . Interestingly, half of the rAbs prepared from nonclonal IgG sequences (defined as expressed only once in SSPE brain) reacted with MV (Burgoon and others 2006) . Moreover, rAbs that did not react with MV antigens in current assays did not react with other antigens, confirming earlier findings in SSPE that most of the intrathecal antibody response is disease relevant (Vandvik and others 1976) .",

Four rAbs that reacted strongly with MV antigens were biopanned with a commercial phage-displayed library of random 12-mer peptides. Phage that bound to rAbs were eluted, amplified, and reapplied to SSPE rAb in successive rounds of panning. After three rounds of panning, bound phage were examined. One or more specific peptide sequences that were enriched in each panning experiment bound specifically to their panning rAb in subsequent ELISA assays. Alignment of the peptide sequences enriched by SSPE rAbs revealed core amino acid motifs in the peptides. Search of the viral and mammalian National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database using consensus peptide sequences obtained with two rAbs revealed several homologies, and restriction of the search to viral protein sequences in the nonredundant database identified precise epitopes on the MV nucleocapsid protein. These specificities confirmed an earlier study in which SSPE IgG and rAbs were biopanned with phagedisplayed cDNA expression libraries constructed from SSPE brain (Burgoon and others 2001) . Application of the biopanning strategy to IgGs and rAbs identified in MS patients (Rand and others 1998; Yu, Gilden, and others 2006) is discussed later in this review.",

Primary infection produces varicella (chickenpox), after which VZV becomes latent in ganglionic neurons along the entire neuraxis. Thus, VZV is a reasonable candidate MS virus. The detection of VZV DNA in CSF and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) of MS patients (Ordonez and others 2004; Mancuso and others 2007; Sotelo and others 2007) suggested a link between VZV infection and MS and was reinforced by the presence of herpesvirions and VZV DNA in CSF and peripheral blood MNCs within one week after exacerbations of patients with relapsing-remitting MS (Sotelo and others 2008) . Our analysis of CSF from four MS patients obtained within eight days of exacerbation, from one patient obtained during remission, from three patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) at high risk for developing MS, and from six patients with other infectious neurologic diseases (OINDs; Burgoon and others 2009) revealed no herpesvirus particles in CSF of any patients using the same electron microscopic and quantitative PCR techniques described by Sotello and others (2008); herpesvirions were readily identified in similarly prepared supernatants from VZVinfected cells in tissue culture. Furthermore, our PCR did not detect VZV genomes in CSF from any MS, CIS, or five of the six OIND patients or in DNA extracted from acute plaques of two MS patients. In contrast, using primers from three distinct regions of the VZV genome, we did amplify VZV DNA in CSF of a patient with VZV radiculomyelitis and in supernatants of VZV-infected cells in tissue culture. Furthermore, our analysis of the antibody response of MS patients for reactivity to VZV showed that CSF IgG from 43 of 53 MS patients and three of eight OINDs were VZV positive by ELISA, and antibodies in several of these CSFs successfully immunoblotted VZV (Sargsyan and others 2010). These findings of measureable VZV activity are not surprising because MS CSF contains antibodies against multiple ubiquitous viruses such as VZV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and rubella (Forghani and others 1980) . Importantly, none of 43 rAbs prepared from clonally expanded plasma cells in MS CSF recognized VZV in multiple immunoassays, indicating that intrathecally synthesized oligoclonal IgG in MS CSF is not directed against VZVspecific proteins.",

Serum and CSF of MS patients show enhanced immunoreactivity to the EBV-specific proteins BRRF2 and EBNA-1, and in ~13% of MS patients, a small fraction of the CSF oligoclonal IgG is removed by incubation with purified BRRF2 and EBNA-1 proteins (Cepok, Zhou, and others 2005) . More recently, latent and lytic EBV transcripts were detected in MS but not in a non-MS inflammatory control brain. Aloisi and colleagues reported that up to 90% of B lymphocytes in active and chronic active MS perivascular white matter lesions and up to 80% of brain-infiltrating plasma cells in MS patients were infected with EBV (Serafini and others 2007) . These results con-trasted earlier findings by Sanders and others (1996) in postmortem brain samples from 37 MS patients and 49 controls, where PCR detected EBV DNA in 27% of MS patients compared to 38% of controls; other herpesviruses were detected more frequently, including herpes simplex virus (47% of MS patients vs. 28% of controls), HHV-6 (57% of MS patients vs. 43% of controls), and VZV (43% of MS patients vs. 32% of controls).

The expression of BAFF in a variable proportion of EBV-infected B cells found in meningeal infiltrates and ectopic B cell follicles of MS brains was suggested to play a role in dysregulation of EBV-infected B cells. Together with the presence of infiltrating CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, these newer findings pro-moted the association of EBV with MS and led to the hypothesis that the immune response in active MS lesions may be secondary to active EBV infection.",

Real-time quantitative PCR detected EBER-1, the most abundant EBV transcript in latently infected cells, in positive control EBV-infected cells and in all of five EBV-infected Hodgkin and B cell lymphomas but not in B lymphocytes or plasma cells from CSF of 20 MS patients or 5 non-MS inflammatory CNS disease controls. Our analysis of 15 plaques from 14 MS patients, 4 of which contained perivascular cuffs of B lymphocytes and 5 from the same patients whose plaques were reported to have abundant EBV (Serafini and others 2007) , revealed none of four EBV transcripts (EBER-1, EBNA-2, LMP-1, and BFRF-1). On the basis of a previous study (Sanders and others 1996) reporting detection of EBV DNA in approximately 10% of MS plaques, we also examined five of these same lesions by reverse transcription and real-time PCR. Lymphoma controls were positive for EBV transcripts. Although we confirmed the presence of the most abundant latency transcript EBER-1 in three MS brain lesions, previously reported as positive for EBV DNA, we did not detect EBV-specific EBNA-2, LMP-1, or BFRF-1 transcripts in any of the MS plaques (Sargsyan and others 2010) . A coincident study by Willis and others (2009) that employed in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR also failed to detect EBV in a cohort of 12 MS specimens containing plaques with heterogeneous B cell infiltrates. The Willis study also used real-time PCR to examine a separate col-lection of 12 MS specimens that included B cell infiltration in the meninges and parenchymal B cell aggregates and only detected EBV at low levels in 2 of the 12 MS meningeal specimens. The rare detection of EBV in MS plaques agrees with most published studies of EBV in MS brain, including the reported higher percentage of EBV-positive samples among nonneurologic disease brains (46%) and Parkinson disease brains (42%) as compared with MS (27%) and Alzheimer (25%) brains (Sanders and others 1996) .",

Because NMO and MS share overlapping clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and histopathologic features, a nosologic distinction between NMO and MS has been the subject of much debate. Lennon and others (2004) The unique association between NMO-IgG and NMO spectrum disorders suggests that the humoral immune response against AQP4 might directly mediate disease pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we generated rAbs from clonally expanded CSF plasma cells from a patient with NMO (Bennett and others 2009). Six of 11 rAbs reacted with AQP4. The AQP4-specific rAbs induced complement-mediated cytoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against AQP4-expressing cell lines. In addition, using the rat MBP EAE model, we showed that injection of an rAb reactive with rat AQP4 produced pathologic changes prototypic for NMO-that is, perivascular demyelination with human Ig deposition and complement activation, polymorphonuclear and granulocytic infiltration, and axonal transection (Fig. 4) -whereas a human AQP4-specific rAb and an MV-specific rAb did not produce a CNS immunopathology (Bennett and others 2009) . Similar findings were obtained after infusion of NMO serum IgG in the rat EAE model (Bradl and others 2009; Kinoshita and others 2009) or after intracerebral injection of serum NMO-IgG and human complement into murine brain (Saadoun and others 2010) .

VH4 bias was not observed in peripheral blood CD19 + IgM + peripheral blood B lymphocytes sorted from matching MS or in matching MS peripheral blood memory cell repertoires, indicating tar-geted activation of plasma blasts in MS CSF repertories. VH4 bias was also found in a chronic meningitis CSF repertoire (IC05-2) but not in CSF repertoires from SSPE (statistically biased for VH1 family gene segments) or in CSF repertoires from an NMO patient and two HIV patients with neurologic involvement. Thus, the global VH4 bias observed in MS CSF plasma cells cannot be explained by increased lifetimes or preferential recruit-ment into the CNS of memory B cells expressing VH4 gene segments. Instead, each CNS inflammatory disease repertoire reveals unique VH family biases, most likely molded to the inducing antigen(s). We further examined VH repertoires from 10 subjects with a clinically isolated demyelinating syndrome (Bennett and others 2008) ; repertoires from 6 of these subjects demonstrated a biased use of VH4 family gene segments in their CSF plasma cell or B lymphocyte repertoires, and one patient demonstrated a VH2 bias. Clinically, subjects with VH4 or VH2 CSF IgG repertoire bias rapidly progressed to definite MS, whereas individuals without repertoire bias did not develop MS after a minimum of 2 years followup (P = .01). Furthermore, detailed analyses identified a unique V region antibody gene mutation pattern (signature) in MS CSF B cells that predicted conversion to MS with 91% accuracy in a small cohort of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (Cameron and others 2009) .",

Linear epitopes can be identified by screening of combinatorial synthetic peptide libraries or expression libraries derived from organisms or tissues, and conformational epitopes can be identified by x-ray crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes. Mimotopes are epitope-mimicking structures (Hirabayashi and others 1996) with peptide sequences that differ from the original antigen sequence.

The Ph.D.-C7C circular library contains displayed peptides structurally constrained in a 7-residue disulfide loop, allowing productive binding conformation with higher affinity than the same sequence expressed in a linear library. We have successfully used MS rAbs to select high-affinity phage peptides by panning phagedisplayed random peptide libraries. The basic panning protocol to identify specific peptides of target antibody involves incubation of the peptide libraries with individual antibody coated onto wells of Reacti-Bind protein A plates (Pierce, Rockford, IL), washing away unbound phage and elution of specifically bound phage with low pH buffer (0.2 M glycine, pH 2.2). Eluted phage are titered and amplified in mid-log growth Escherichia coli ER 2738 cells and taken through additional binding/amplification cycles to enrich for specific binding peptides. After two to three rounds, individual clones are characterized, and positive phage peptides are identified by DNA sequencing (Fig. 7) . For antibodies that fail to select any positive phage peptides after three rounds of panning, fourth and fifth pans are usually performed using an ultrafast panning method recently developed in our lab (Yu and others 2009 ). This method uses phage amplified in mid-log growing E. coli (50 minutes at 37 \u00b0C) in the presence of the selecting antibody for subsequent panning without further phage purification, obviating the need for traditional large-scale amplification and purification.

Several independent assays are routinely performed in our lab to determine phage peptide specificity and affinity, including dose-dependent ELISA, competitive inhibition assays, and immunoblotting (Yu, Gilden, and others 2006) . If the selecting antibody is limited and cannot be replaced like MS CSF, a highly sensitive technique termed phage-mediated real-time immuno-PCR (IPCR) is used (Yu and others 2007) . In IPCR, antibody (CSF or sera or MS rAb) is coated onto wells of ELISA plates, and phage peptides are added. After incubation and washing, bound phage are lysed, and phage DNA is detected by PCR. This technique exploits the fact that phage particles can be used both as binding antigen and as a DNA template for quantitative PCR amplification. Thus, phage IPCR links the physical association between phenotype (the displayed peptide) and genotype (the encod-ing DNA) within the same phage particle. We have demonstrated that phage IPCR reproducibility detects as few as 100 phage particles (Yu and others 2007) .",

In combination with epidemiologic, genetic, and immuno-logic data, the presence of persistent oligoclonal IgG in MS patients provides paraclinical evidence of a chronic CNS infection. The critical task is to identify the specificity of such targets, which will likely provide clues, if not the cause, of disease. The demonstration that rAbs generated from CNS clonally expanded plasma cells in SSPE and NMO are directed against diseaserelevant agents provides proof of principle that experiments aimed at defining the target antigens of IgG produced by clonally expanded CSF B lymphocytes and plasma cells will identify disease-relevant targets in MS. The isolation of a potential infectious cause of MS coupled with high-throughput techniques to identify target epitopes and mimotopes will provides a framework for the develop-ment of novel preventative and therapeutic strategies. Direct immunofluorescence with a 1 to 20 dilution of antibody to human IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (green fluorescence) shows IgG deposition at the junction of plaque-periplaque white matter (middle arrow), in mononuclear cells (bottom arrow), and in normal white matter (top arrow). The antigen against which the IgG in the multiple sclerosis brain and CSF is directed is unknown. Proposed model of Theiler's virus persistence in macrophages leading to demyelination.
