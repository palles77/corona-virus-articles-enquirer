Unrestrained molecular-dynamics simulations on 18-mer duplexes with isonucleosides incorporated at the 3'-end or in the center of one strand have been carried out with explicit solvent under periodic boundary conditions using the AMBER force field and the particle mesh Ewald method. The Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonding patterns of the duplexes studied remained intact throughout the simulation. For the modified duplexes, the changes observed in the inter-base pair parameters and backbone torsional angles were primarily localized at the isonucleoside-inserted area. All five structures studied remained in the B-form family. The decreased stacking abilities indicated by the large changes in inter-base pair parameters and the large changes in backbones made the modified duplexes show a minor thermal destabilization in comparison with native DNA. The MM_PBSA method for estimating binding free energies on two complementary strands was used. The results showed that the binding free energies of isonucleoside-incorporated DNA duplexes were lower than the native DNA duplex, which is in good agreement with experimental observations.",

            "text": "Synthetic oligonucleotides and their analogs have attracted considerable interest because of their potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The natural oligonucleotides, however, are usually degraded relatively easily by cellular nucleases and cannot be used directly as therapeutics. It is therefore a challenge to develop modified antisense oligonucleotides that are degradation resistant, and can hybridize selectively to target nucleic acids with strong affinity. Over the past decades, a large number of oligonucleotides with modifications in the phosphodiester, sugar, or nucleobase have been prepared. Among them, phosphorothioate, which is the first generation of antisense compounds, shows increased resistance to degradation both in vitro and in vivo [6] [7] [8] [9] , and one drug has been admitted to market by the FDA, which represents a first indication of the feasibility of the therapeutic antisense concept. Meanwhile, many antisense phosphorothioates are in phase I/II clinical trials [10, 11] . However, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides often show decreased specificity and affinity to the target sequences [12] and inefficient cellular uptake. Thus, other analogs, such as phosphoramidates [13] , PNA [14] , LNA [15] , \u03b1-L-LNA [16] , HNA [17] , ANA [18] , CAN [19] , CeNA [20] , and INA [21] , have been studied systematically. They have proved to be capable of hybridizing with complementary DNA or RNA with increased thermal stabilities compared to the parent DNA:DNA or DNA:RNA duplexes and can be valid candidates for clinical applications.",

Isonucleosides are a new class of nucleoside analogues in which the nucleobase is linked to various positions of ribose other than C1\u2032. Previous research has shown that a single isonucleotide-incorporated oligonucleotide antagonized the enzymatic hydrolysis of snake-venom phosphodiesterase strongly, although the binding ability of the modified sequence to the complementary sequence was slightly decreased, which indicated that there was a possibility to design a stable antisense oligonucleotide by incorporating isonucleotides in the sequence [26] . For the detailed understanding of structural information of isonucleoside-modified antisense oligonucleotides, an 18-mer of the antisense sequence 5\u2032-AACATCTCCTGAGGGA AC -3\u2032 incorporated with isonucleosides A 1 (6\u2032-OH free) or A 2 (6\u2032-OH protected by allyl group), which was complementary to the mRNA region encoding spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (22, 415 bp) has been studied by detailed unrestrained molecular dynamics in aqueous solution (Fig. 1) . The results, which agree with the experimental data, provide an insight into the local and global structural features of the duplexes containing A 1 and A 2 . The structural and energetic analysis from the MD simulations provides some information for further research and development of isonucleotide-incorporated antisense oligonucleotides.",

Subsequent equilibration steps, during which position constraints on the DNA molecules were gradually relaxed, as well as the final production runs, were done by using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method to calculate electrostatic interactions [32, 33] . First, another 25 ps of MD were performed while still holding the DNA fixed to relax the solvent molecules fully and to complete the density equilibration. This was followed by a second set of 1,000 steps of minimization and 3 ps of MD, which were carried out with constraints on the DNA molecules of 25 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 . Finally, five rounds of 600 steps of energy minimization were performed, in which positional constraints were reduced to 5.0 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 in each round.",

The binding free energies of all double strands were investigated using the single-trajectory approach. Singletrajectory results mean that the thermodynamics data are extracted from a single trajectory of the complex. The assumption here is that the natural DNA, the isonucleosideincorporated DNA, and the complementary DNA conformations are the same in the double strand and in the dissociated form and thus the vibrational, rotational, and translational entropy contributions can be neglected. Esti- mation of binding free energies in this manner has proven successful previously [36, 37, 39] . The binding free energy (\u0394G binding ) between the two complementary strands is calculated as the difference between the electrostatic interaction energies, van der Waals interaction energies, the solvation free energies, as well as the entropies of the double strands and the dissociated system: We applied the same force field and parameter set used in the MD simulations and an electrostatic constant 1 to compute the electrostatic energy (E elec ) and the van der Waals energy (E vdw ) but without cutoff for nonbonded interactions.",

For all duplexes, the values of twist changed along the strands. However, for the majority of the base pairs of each duplex, values even lower than that of A-DNA were observed. The average twists over the sequence were 32\u00b11\u00b0. The value was more characteristic of A than B. This showed particularly that the modifications did not cause the helix to unwind. In general, it could be concluded from the calculated results of all helix parameters that the overall conformations of the five duplexes remained in the B-conformations during the entire course of the simulations. It is known that the global intra-base pair parameters describe the relative displacement and orientation of the bases in the Watson-Crick base pairs. These parameters of the native S0:S duplex obtained during the simulation were very similar to those found in the four modified DNA duplexes (especially in the modified base-pair steps) according to our calculations. The parameters also explained why there were no fundamental differences in hydrogen-bonding properties among duplex S0:S, S1:S, S2:S, S3:S, and S4:S. However, for the inter-base pair parameters, several showed large differences in the modified area, which might indicate the effect of the isonucleosides on the conformation of the neighboring bases.",

The rise parameters showed large deviations for the A 1 , A 2 , and their neighboring base-pair steps in the S2:S, S3:S, and S4:S duplexes from corresponding native S0:S values. Wherever the isonucleoside A 1 or A 2 was located at the 3\u2032end or in the center of the sequence, the slide and rise values of the A 2 base pair steps was larger than those of the A 1 ones. The A 1 -T20/A16-T21 (29.1\u00b0) or A 2 -T20/A16- T21 (21.2\u00b0) base pair steps in the S1:S or S2:S duplexes, respectively, showed larger roll values than in the S0:S duplex. In the S3:S and S4:S duplexes, the isonucleosides A 1 and A 2 induced changes in the roll of the steps below and above but not in the steps connected by A 1 and A 2 themselves. As shown in Fig. 3 , the twist angles of S0:S, S2:S, and S3:S did not show obvious changes along the sequence. However, for S1:S and S4:S duplexes, significant differences were observed in the twist values. The lowest twist angle was found for the A 1 -T20/A16-T21 step (12.5\u00b0) in S1:S structure at this base pair step. And the C6-G31/T5-A30, T10-A27/C9-G26 and G13-C24/A 2 -T23 steps in the S4:S structure also showed small twist values lower than 20\u00b0. These small twist values were an indicator of untwisting of the DNA helix at the corresponding sites. Such small twist values for the G13-C24/A 2 -T23 step might be caused by the incorporation of isonucleoside A 2 , but we need much more studies to understand why the T10-A27/C9-G26 and G13-C24/A 2 -T23 steps also show so small twist values. Inter-base-pair parameters were used to describe the stacking interactions of base pairings. Thus, the unusually large changes in these parameters for the isonucleoside area decreased the stacking interactions of base pairings in the modified S1:S, S2:S, S3:S, and S4:S duplexes. These decreased stacking interactions made the duplexes incorporated with isonucleosides a little less stable than the unmodified DNA molecule, in agreement with the energy comparison.",

The intra-base pair parameter describes the geometry of the Watson-Crick base pairings, while the interbase pair parameter describes the stacking interactions of the bases. Generally, the conformations of the five duplexes studied were found to remain in the B-conformations during the entire course of the simulations. A few parameters, however, indicated some features of A-type DNA.
