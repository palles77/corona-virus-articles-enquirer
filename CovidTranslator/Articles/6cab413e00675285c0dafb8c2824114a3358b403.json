These innovative biopharmaceuticals present the remarkable advantages of closely mimicking the three-dimensional nature of an actual virus while lacking the virus genome packaged inside its capsid. As a result, an equally efficient but safer prophylaxis is anticipated as compared to inactivated or live attenuated viral vaccines. With the advent of successful cases of approved VLP-based vaccines, pharmaceutical companies are indeed redirecting their resources to the development of such products.

VLPs fall in the size range of viruses (22-200 nm or more in some cases), with their exact size and morphology depending on the particular viral proteins being incorporated. VLPs offer a promising approach to the production of vaccines against many diseases, because their repetitive, high density display of epitopes is potentially highly effective in eliciting strong immune responses (Bachmann et al., 2004) . VLPs therefore constitute a safe and effective approach for the induction of neutralizing antibodies to surface proteins, where soluble forms of their protein subunits have failed. VLPs can also be exploited as ''platforms'' for the presentation of foreign epitopes and/or targeting molecules on chimeric VLPs. This can be achieved through modification of the VLP gene sequence(s), such that fusion VLP proteins and foreign vaccine proteins are assembled into VLPs during de novo synthesis. VLP chimeras have been extensively explored as vaccine candidates over the last 20 years (Pumpens and Grens, 2001) .",

Envisaging the same success, there is currently a large number of other VLP-based vaccine candidates, including VLPs composed of multiple different proteins (especially when different viral structural proteins are needed for a stable VLP), either in clinical trials or undergoing preclinical evaluation; examples include influenza virus, parvovirus, Norwalk and various chimeric VLPs (Clinicaltrials.gov, 2010) . Adding more viral proteins brings nevertheless extra challenges for setting up optimal processing parameters up-and downstream; furthermore, the required quality control methods are inevitably more complex because a mixture of both assembled and non-assembled proteins co-exist.

In preclinical development there are several other VLPs produced via BEVS/IC: e.g., Ebola VLP (Sun et al., 2009) , Hantaan virus (Betenbaugh et al., 1995) , Hepatitis C virus (HCV) VLP (Lechmann et al., 2001) , herpes simplex virus VLP (Tatman et al., 1994) , norovirus VLP (Almanza et al., 2008) , and others (Rold\u00e3o et al., 2010) . Table 1 summarizes different VLPs produced using the BEVS/IC. With such a long track record on recombinant protein production and large-scale suspension cultures established in either stirred or rocked bioreactors, the BEVS/IC has been shown to be one of the best cell culture systems for this purpose. The only potential disadvantage of BEVS/IC resides in its pattern of post-translational modifications (Davis and Wood, 1995) . Insect cells perform simpler post-translational glycosylation based on enriched mannose in comparison to mammalian cells, which can be a shortcoming for certain applications (Wu et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, improved insect cells lines -''humanized'' cells that perform mammalian-like post-translation modifications -are becoming available (Hang et al., 2003) (see also van Oers, this volume). Thus, when the insect cell glycosylation pattern and biological functionality of the desired VLP match, BEVS/IC is most likely the strongest candidate tool for VLP-based vaccine development.",

Running batch and fed-batch bioreactors (from 2 to 2000 L) is straightforward with cell densities usually reaching high levels (over 10 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ mL) and are generally robust as long as the culture conditions are tightly monitored and controlled. These latter features make BEVS/ IC especially attractive when compared to mammalian expression systems, which often require tedious cell culture adaptation procedures before suspension. Insect cells are also able to grow in the absence of serum, which is highly desirable because serum may be a cause of adventitious viruses thereby requiring more intensive purification processes in order to remove serum proteins in addition to host cell impurities. The BEVS/IC system is characterized by a two-phase process, where insect cells are (i) grown to a desired viable cell density and (ii) infected by recombinant baculoviruses for protein expression during the exponential cell growth phase (as opposed to other systems). The second step involves definition of the most suitable multiplicity of infection (MOI), time of infection (TOI) and cell concentration at infection (CCI). The design and production of recombinant baculoviruses carrying the desired gene of interest is typically fast, allowing short turnaround times, critical when producing vaccines based on viruses whose surface proteins rapidly mutate over different seasons (e.g., influenza A virus, Cox and Hashimoto, 2011) . Such product development flexibility is essential for a timely response to a potential pandemic outbreak.",

Although other expression systems like bacteria or yeast normally achieve higher yields, they would not match the degree of complexity of VLPs designed with the BEVS/IC (up to five or theoretically even more diverse proteins are possible). These high expression levels are explained by the ability of the virus to shut off the transcription of host genes and allocate the cellular transcriptional and translational machinery for the overexpression of heterologous genes delivered upon infection (Roldao et al., 2007) .",

Still, there are some drawbacks when going fully disposable, for example: (i) limited extractable and/or leachable substance quality control data from disposable materials and disposable manufacturers; (ii) disposable bag systems are difficult to handle for scales over 1000 L; (iii) pressure limitation; (iv) high temperature limitation. Nonetheless, with the current improvements in USP yields and in some cases early proof-of-concept stages, small to medium scales are sufficient, which make disposable bioreactors extremely appealing. In addition, a given lead biopharmaceutical has generally a much smoother technology transfer to any contract manufacturing organization (CMO) when relying on disposable manufacturing than with stainless-steel equipment due to the flexibility allowed by the former.",

These include the bioreactor parameters such as dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, agitation rate, inlet gas flow and composition, volume or fluid dynamics. All of these parameters may influence VLP production by interfering with the cell growth and metabolic activity or even with protein post-translational modifications. Biological processes are complex and highly interactive responding to a greater or lesser extent to environmental stimuli. Although insect cells are very robust, optimization of bioreactor parameters should be carefully performed. Table 2 highlights critical steps in the design and optimization of USP. Regarding the molecular/cell biology, the nature of the promoters strongly impacts productivities as early, late or very late promoters can be chosen. Early promoters induce lower yields as a result of the fact that, at such an early stage, most enzymes and transcriptional factors necessary for protein expression are not yet fully active (Roldao et al., 2007) . With late or very late promoters, protein expression occurs towards the end of the viral replication cycle when the cells are approaching the stationary and death phases and proteases may start to degrade the newly produced proteins and their post-translational modifications.",

The optimal MOI is typically dependent on the target product (single or multiple protein based VLP) and the production strategy (single-or co-infection). For single protein expression, low MOIs (0.01-1 virus/cell) normally induce higher volumetric productivities than high MOIs (>1 virus/cell) as an outcome of higher infected cell concentration -specific productivities at low and high MOIs are comparable (Rold\u00e3o et al., 2008) .

Metabolome/proteome or more recently ''fluxome'' (Teixeira et al., 2007) tools show great promise for USP optimization as an integrated analysis of the metabolic fluxes can derive online process control strategies to further improve product yields or productivities. This can be achieved through novel systems biology tools, e.g., metabolic flux analysis coupled with mathematical models to analyze the complex network of metabolite fluxes and identify the limiting factors (Teixeira et al., 2009) . In regard to the assembly of the required protein subunits into the final VLP, thermodynamic studies can prove very useful for identifying the most suited environmental conditions upon production and also for stability maintenance during downstream processing (DSP) and storage. A recent study of in vitro assembly/ disassembly of rotavirus VLPs explores how physicochemical parameters affect the assembly and stability of the produced VLPs (Mellado et al., 2009 ): protein macrostructure stability was shown to be highly dependent on pH, ionic strength and temperature. As a follow-up, our team developed a thermodynamic equilibriumbased model describing, for the first time, the assembly of a triple-layered VLP (Rold\u00e3o et al., 2010) . Simulations suggested that the concentration of correctly assembled particles is maximized if the structural proteins are provided at the exact stoichiometric ratio and with high concentration. Such insights lead to the conclusion that the amount of unassembled/malformed VLPs typically observed in many systems is most likely due to a non-optimal ratio of proteins at the moment of assembly inside the cell host.",

Dead-end disposable depth-filters have been used efficiently (Peixoto et al., 2007) . Tangential flow microfiltration, using membrane cassettes or hollow fiber units (Saha et al., 1994) with 0.2 lm retention pore is also possible. The use of depth filters makes the sieving and particulate retention process much more efficient because of the depth-dependent size separation factor; moreover, due to the charged nature of some depth-filter materials (non-propylene) and their three-dimensional arrangement (Prashad and Tarrach, 2006) , a higher degree of cell and cell debris retention is achieved while VLPs still permeate. A careful selection of the depth-filter materials is critical as the use of non-inert materials may bind efficiently not only the debris but also the VLPs being sieved (Table 2 ).",

These porous matrices are particularly suited for very large particles, such as VLPs. The specific surface areas (per unit volume) of porous matrices with pore sizes of 0.8 lm (Mustang membrane adsorbers from Pall), 3 lm (Sartobind membrane adsorbers from Sartorius-Stedim Biotech) or >1 lm (CIM monoliths from BIA Separations) are significantly larger than those of resin beads used in packed-bed chromatography, whose pores are generally 10-20 nm for conventional resins or 400 nm for perfusive resins (Trilisky et al., 2009) . VLPs, ranging from 20 nm to over 200 nm, are hindered from binding onto the internal surface area of the resin, resulting in sub-optimal usage of such matrices. In addition, due to the porous nature of these matrices, diffusional mass transfer resistances are highly reduced. For the case of VLPs that have rather small diffusion coefficients, as compared to smaller biologicals such as proteins, these matrices clearly present an advantage over packed-bed chromatography. Moreover, these porous matrices can be purchased as disposable units eliminating cleaning and sterilization as well as their validation costs.",

This is critical so that process developers can design less ''blindly'' USP optimization (e.g., by changing the strategy of infection) or selecting the right chromatographic matrix/operating conditions (e.g., for removing a specific/resilient impurity). Moreover, for a cGMP process, product identity, quality, titer, purity and consistency/reproducibility need to be carefully documented.
