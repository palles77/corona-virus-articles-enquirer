AEs of COPD account for approximately one in ten emergency medical admissions to hospital, and the in-hospital mortality is 10%. AEs are responsible for 70% of the direct costs attributable to COPD.",

            "text": "AEs generally become both more frequent and more severe as the severity of the underlying COPD progresses. On average, patients with moderate to severe COPD, typical of those attending secondary care, will have between one and two AEs requiring additional treatment annually. There are, however, large differences in the annual AE incidence rates of individual patients, and those prone to more frequent AEs experience a particular burden of disease as outlined in Figure  39 -1. The factors predisposing some patients to frequent AEs are poorly understood but may include daily bronchitic symptoms, greater severity of underlying disease, greater airway inflammation in the stable state, a predisposition to acquiring respiratory viral infection, and/or the presence of lower airway bacterial colonization (described later). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY COPD has been defined by the World Health Organization as a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive, not fully reversible, and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases. Airway inflammation is even greater at the time of AE, and the assumption has been made that this additional inflammation provokes symptoms such as worsening dyspnea and sputum production by mechanisms relating to airway tone, airway wall edema, and mucus production. The resultant airtrapping increases the work of breathing and causes additional impairment to respiratory muscle function. Triggers of increased airway inflammation are, therefore, considered to be the most common causes of AEs, predominantly tracheobronchial infection and with a lesser role for pollutants. The effects of increased inflammation at AE require further clarification, however, because a direct relationship between the clinical severity of the AE and the degree of airway inflammation has never been conclusively demonstrated.",

            "text": "Defining the role of airway infection in causing AEs is not a simple task. Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled the isolation of respiratory viruses and potentially pathogenic bacteria from the airways of many patients during exacerbations. The most common organisms identified are listed in Table 39 -1. Patients with more severe underlying disease, however, are also colonized with bacteria when in their stable state. The presence of an organism at AE does not, therefore, imply a role in causing that exacerbation. More recently, it has been suggested that a change in the colonizing bacterial strain may be the precipitating event. However, not all strain changes are associated with an AE, and not all AEs are associated with strain change. Reflecting this, and as discussed later, antibiotics may not be of universal benefit during AEs. Rhinovirus is the most commonly identified viral pathogen, and consequently, AEs are more common during the winter months when viral circulation in the community is higher. The role of atypical organisms such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species remains unclear.",

Spirometry is not generally helpful, because absolute values may be misleading, changes at exacerbation are small, and patients who are acutely dyspneic may have difficulty performing the maneuvers accurately. Sputum microscopy and culture may help to refine empiric antibiotic therapy in those not improving or in those with resistant Pseudomonas infection, but the role of microbiologic studies in the initial evaluation has not been clarified.

Although often used in combination, there is little evidence to suggest an additive benefit. There is also no evidence that administering the medications by nebulization is any more effective than by a metered-dose inhaler and large-volume spacer. However, nebulizers are often preferred in dyspneic patients. Nebulizers for COPD should be driven on compressed air rather than oxygen because of concern for the effect of high alveolar oxygen tensions on ventilationperfusion relationships. Patients prescribed long-acting bronchodilators could continue this therapy, but there is little evidence to support introducing long-acting agents during an AE, and short-acting drugs are preferred. The recommended approach is, therefore, to increase the dose and or frequency of either a short-acting b 2 -agonist or an anticholinergic, with both drugs used together in the event of inadequate clinical response.",

Prolonged courses are not of additional benefit (and increase the risk of side effects), and there is no evidence to suggest that tapering the dose is advantageous. Many physicians choose to give the first dose intravenously. Nebulized budesonide results in similar improvements in lung function to oral dosing but is more expensive.

In addition, and in contrast to invasive ventilation, NIV may be used earlier and intermittently, which, therefore, facilitates communication, nutrition, and physiotherapy. NIV is usually administered as pressure-cycled bilevel positive airway pressure in which the inspiratory and expiratory pressures may be independently varied. NIV is not, however, a substitute for invasive ventilation when the latter is required. Therefore, a plan of management should be made with regard to suitability for invasive ventilation should NIV fail. In addition, some patients may have relative contraindications to NIV or respiratory failure of such severity that they should be immediately assessed for invasive ventilation. The indications and relative contraindications for NIV are provided in Table 39 -2. Most, but not all, patients suitable for NIV are able to tolerate the treatment.

Mortality after invasive ventilation is approximately 20%, and weaning from the ventilator can be challenging. This is a further setting in which NIV may be valuable.

Some patients appear never to fully recover to their preexacerbation lung function. Those patients admitted to the hospital have an inhospital mortality of approximately 10%, and for patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure, the mortality approaches 50% at 2 years. Some patients may be suitable for early supported discharge schemes. Although these are associated with similar outcomes, they appear no more cost-effective than standard care. Given the importance of AEs and having managed the acute event, it is important to consider instituting a range of preventative measures to reduce the risk of future AEs. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that a number of classes of medications reduce the incidence of AEs. These include the long-acting b 2 -agonists, long-acting anticholinergics, and inhaled corticosteroids (at least for those with moderately severe underlying disease). Combination therapy with longacting b 2 -agonists and inhaled corticosteroids appears superior to the use of either component alone, and this combination may also have a mortality benefit. Oral corticosteroids are ineffective at preventing exacerbations, and because they also have no effect on other outcomes measures, they are not indicated in stable COPD. Ongoing trials are reexamining the role of antibiotics in reducing exacerbation frequency; there is some existing evidence that these drugs may be effective, but many existing trials included patients with simple chronic bronchitis, the drugs used were older, and any benefit must be balanced against the possibility of promoting drug resistance. Macrolides hold particular promise given their recognized antiinflammatory action. Vaccinations against influenza and S. pneumoniae are recommended. Pulmonary rehabilitation has also been shown to reduce hospitalization in patients with COPD. Furthermore, early treatment has been shown to reduce exacerbation length, and this might be included in a patient education program. There are, therefore, a variety of measures that may be instituted to reduce the number and consequences of exacerbations. For this reason and for further assessment of patients who presented in respiratory failure, it is usually appropriate to review patients in an ambulatory care setting after an admission with acute exacerbation.",
