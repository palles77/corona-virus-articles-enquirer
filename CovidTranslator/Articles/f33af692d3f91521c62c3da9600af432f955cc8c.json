Live-attenuated cold-adapted HPIV3 vaccines have been evaluated in infants but a suitable interval for administration of a second dose of vaccine has not been defined. Methods: HPIV3-seronegative children between the ages of 6 and 36 months were randomized 2:1 in a blinded study to receive two doses of 10 5 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of live-attenuated, recombinant cold-passaged human PIV3 vaccine (rHPIV3cp45) or placebo 6 months apart. Serum antibody levels were assessed prior to and approximately 4-6 weeks after each dose. Vaccine virus infectivity, defined as detection of vaccine-HPIV3 in nasal wash and/or a \u2265 4-fold rise in serum antibody titer, and reactogenicity were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following immunization. Results: Forty HPIV3-seronegative children (median age 13 months; range 6-35 months) were enrolled; 27 (68%) received vaccine and 13 (32%) received placebo. Infectivity was detected in 25 (96%) of 26 evaluable vaccinees following doses 1 and 9 of 26 subject (35%) following dose 2. Among those who shed virus, the median duration of viral shedding was 12 days (range 6-15 days) after dose 1 and 6 days (range 3-8 days) after dose 2, with a mean peak log 10 viral titer of 3.4 PFU/mL (SD: 1.0) after dose 1 compared to 1.5 PFU/mL (SD: 0.92) after dose 2. Overall, reactogenicity was mild, with no difference in rates of fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms between vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusion: rHPIV3cp45 was immunogenic and well-tolerated in seronegative young children. A second dose administered 6 months after the initial dose was restricted in those previously infected with vaccine virus; however, the second dose boosted antibody responses and induced antibody responses in two previously uninfected children.",

The rHPIV3cp45 vaccine contains the 15 known attenuating mutations present in the biologically derived virus [24] . The use of a cDNA approach has the advantage of using a virus with a short, well-characterized passage history as well as the ability to readily regenerate and modify the virus as needed [7] . The rHPIV3cp45 vaccine was recently evaluated in a phase I trial in which infants ages 6-12 months were randomized to receive two doses of rHPIV3cp45 vaccine or placebo, administered 4-10 weeks apart [25] . While the safety profile and the infectivity of the first dose of rHPIV3cp45 were similar to that previously observed with the biologically derived virus, the second dose of vaccine was highly restricted in replication and did not boost serum antibody responses [25] . For this reason, we explored whether extending the interval between doses might enhance the infectivity and immunogenicity of a second dose of vaccine. The purpose of this study was to determine the tolerability, infectivity, and immunogenicity of two 10 5 TCID 50 doses of rHPIV3cp45 administered 6 months apart to HPIV3 seronegative infants and children.",

We demonstrated that children with a substantial antibody response following the first dose of vaccine did not seem able to be either infected or boosted when a second dose was administered approximately 6 months after the first dose. In contrast, the second dose of vaccine given six months later appeared to boost antibody titers in those with a suboptimal response following the first dose, and it was associated with lower amounts of detectable virus in the nasal wash. Of interest, children who required a second dose of vaccine to achieve an antibody response were significantly younger than those who did not. Overall, this study demonstrated that two doses separated by 6 months are able to infect children under three years of age who were not infected with a single dose of vaccine.",

Since HPIV3 typically circulates during the spring and summer months when these trials are conducted, sequence analysis proved a useful tool for differentiating between infection with wt and vaccine virus. This technology is important in assessing the safety and reactogenicity of vaccines and the conduct of clinical trials: illness in a placebo recipient was able to be directly related to infection with wtHPIV3 and not to potential spread of vaccine virus in the clinic setting.",

For example, the 2003 study by Karron et al. in adults, children, and infants revealed 82-100% infectivity of a single dose in seronegative children between the ages of 6-36 months using a dose of either 10 4 or 10 5 [8] . A later study by Bernstein et al. studied the recombinant HPIV3 vaccine utilized in our clinical trial, rHPIV3cp45, in infants 6 to less than 12 months of age with 3 doses of vaccine at a dose of 10 5 [10] . In this younger population, viral shedding after dose 1 was documented in 85% of recipients compared with 89% in our older population. After 3 doses in the Bernstein trial, either seroresponse or shedding occurred in 95% of vaccine recipients compared with our rate of infectivity (seroresponse or shedding) in 96% after dose 1 and 93% after dose 2.",

Since the youngest children are at highest risk for hospitalization or receiving medical care, this group would be the natural targets for immunization to provide the most protection against disease. In addition, use of rHPIV3cp45 in combination with live-attenuated RSV and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) vaccines can be envisioned as a strategy to provide broad protection against important respiratory viral pathogens of infancy and early childhood [18] . A dosing schedule for this type of vaccine would need to be harmonized with current pediatric vaccination schedules.",
