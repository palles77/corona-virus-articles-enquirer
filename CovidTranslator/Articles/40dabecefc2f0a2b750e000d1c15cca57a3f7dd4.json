The first concerns the genetic changes that take place in the viruses and the resulting implications for viral pathogenesis, epidemiology and diagnosis. Viruses do not necessarily remain genetically stable during the course of persistent infection or during their spread from one population of animals to another. In fact recent molecular analysis has revealed a remarkably high mutation frequency, especially in RNA genomes. The second theme concerns the methods of controlling virus infection. The latter topic includes discussion of current control practices and their limitations, and also discussion of newer methods based on recent technological innovations, such as the application of recombinant DNA techniques. These two themes are not unrelated however, and future success in virus control will only be achieved by taking into account those aspects of viruses which have recently begun to receive their due recognition, i.e. properties such as changes in virulence, persistence within the host, and others.",

The nature of the classification attempt is a reflection of the relative sophistication of the technology available, and no doubt in a few years we shall be able to compare all the viral genome nucleotide sequences. Unfortunately viruses do not fall into convenient groups of features, with the possible exception of gross morphology. Instead they are continuously undergoing genetic change, with consequent changes in their protein composition.

Table 2 lists the current major livestock in different regions of the world, together with the human populations according to estimates available to 1981 (Animal Health Yearbook, 1981) . Regional disparities in the distribution of species are of course hidden in this simplified scheme. For example, Australia and New Zealand rely heavily on an abnormally high population of sheep, respectively 9 and 23 per capita, and of cattle, with corresponding values of 1.7 and 2.7 per capita. Their animal products are largely exported, thus a high standard of veterinary health is essential to these countries. Some general conclusions can however be drawn from the figures in Table 2 . In terms of sheer numbers poultry are the most frequent livestock (avians out-numbering humans by 50%), followed by sheep plus goats, cattle, pigs, horses and others. Pigs are generally unimportant in African countries, while horses are particularly important in some Asian and American countries. The relative numbers will probably change however, in accordance with changes in local economic factors, the depletion or acquisition of grazing land, and husbandry practices.",

This virus is not endemic in the USA and is normally restricted by selective importation of animal products. Estimates were made of the current annual consumption in North America of those foods directly affected by a FMD virus epidemic. Losses arising from such an epidemic, due to financial losses combined with increased consumer costs, were estimated to be 12 billion dollars (1982 value) .

Some viruses are strictly species specific, while others have adapted themselves to many different hosts. Since viruses are generally unstable in the environment, transmission in the wild is usually limited to members within a herd, except when direct contact is made between animals of different species. The latter may be effected during fighting, by sharing water-holes, or by the consumption of virus-infected fluids and tissues by predators. However, many viruses have circumvented this limitation by making use of insect vectors, especially mosquitoes and ticks. There are more than 400 so-called 'arboviruses' (ARthropod BOrne viruses), representing several different virus families, which have adapted to growth in the cold blooded invertebrate host as well as many vertebrate species (McLean, 1980 In contrast, domesticated animals of different species are often deliberately maintained in close contact, thus permitting viruses more opportunity of cross-infection. Since the intervention of humans and their traditional husbandry practices, viruses have probably encountered more opportunities for adapting to novel hosts.",

It can be transmitted between pigs by means of a specific tick vector, or by a porcine louse, or by direct contact without vector intervention (Wilkinson, 1981) . Thus the virus has adapted itself to allow for several modes of transmission, although the relative importance of each is unknown. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can also be transmitted between various species of livestock and wild animals by physical contact, by mosquitoes, and by sandflies. Again it is not known how important each route is. Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) apparently requires vector mediated transmission, although in this case mosquitos, sandflies and even gnats have all been implicated as vectors. Bluetongue virus (BTV), which infects primarily sheep and goats, can be transmitted by Culicoides midges, and in this case the host specificity is determined by the vector (Sellers, 1981) .",

The virus can be transmitted to the sea lions by feeding them virus-infected fish of a certain species, or by infecting these same fish with a virus-infected lungworm parasite of the fish. As a result of their investigations, the authors concluded that the virus was part of a parasite-fish-sea lion cycle .

            "text": "A virus is essentially a collection of genes enclosed within a protein coat and often, in about half of the known animal viruses, is surrounded by a membrane. Many of these viruses are sufficiently stable in the environment, or in vectors, to ensure their transmissibility to other animals. Intervention in transmission however is difficult to perform in practice. For this reason, and in view of the spectacular successes of antibiotics in controlling replication of bacteria, much attention has focused on methods of interfering with virus replication. Unfortunately there are two basic problems inherent in this approach. Firstly, viruses comprise the same basic chemical makeup as the host cells themselves, and secondly the overall biochemical processes involved in their replication are very similar to analogous host cell processes. In order to circumvent these limitations it is necessary to find ways of either augmenting the body's natural defense mechanisms, or searching for possible unique aspects in the viral replication schemes. Figure 3 summarizes the common stages in virus replication, and Fig. 4 summarizes the virus replication schemes determined to date. In spite of the thousands of animal viruses identified so far, they fit conveniently into 17 families and, more importantly, into only seven replication schemes. The classification is essentially a modification of the one proposed by Baltimore and is based upon the nature of the viral genome and its requirements for replication (Baltimore, 1971; Bachrach, 1978; Carasco and Smith, 1984; Kucera and Myrvik, 1985) . According to this mode of classification, other features such as mechanisms of virus penetration; uncoating (i.e. removal of extraneous proteins); intracellular site of replication; and details of the packaging and maturation of the viruses (see Fig. 3 ), are of secondary importance, and seem at present to be less amenable to intervention. Although the specific processes of transcription, translation and DNA replication are essentially the same as the analogous host cell processes, there may be sufficient differences in certain details to allow for the design of appropriate chemical inhibitors. The object is of course to find a chemical which can enter the virus-infected cells and block a step in the replication scheme without inhibiting any host cell directed process. Fortunately many viruses code for specific enzymes, and some of these are sufficiently different from corresponding host cell enzymes to encourage optimism in this approach. Further details will be discussed in Section 9. In the present context, attention is drawn to the so-called 'targets' for antiviral therapy indicated in Fig. 3 .",

It should not be forgotten that apparent tissue localization may only reflect the natural mode of transmission of virus. Thus so-called respiratory and genital strains of herpes viruses (e.g. infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, IBRV) usually represent only this, rather than the existence of two distinct viruses with two different target tissues (Misra et al., 1983; Ludwig, 1984) . Once a virus has entered the blood or lymph it can gain access to many more tissues. For this reason viruses transmitted by biting arthropods easily disseminate through the body. In contrast the degree of penetration of respiratory viruses is to a large extent determined by the physical properties of the transported particles. Viruses transmitted in smaller aerosols are more likely to penetrate the deep alveolar spaces (and hence gain closer proximity to the blood) than are viruses transmitted in larger droplets (Halpin, 1975) .",

A more widespread defensive barrier is the basement membrane, which is found surrounding many tissues, and which appears to be a partially effective barrier to viruses entering these tissues from the blood and lymph. Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) utilize salivary glands as primary targets in their natural hosts, hence their old name: salivary gland viruses. Yet these viruses, as exemplified by the murine CMV, require several days between the time they are disseminated in the blood and the time at which they eventually penetrate the glandular cells. By this time the replication of virus in visceral organs such as spleen and liver is over (Hudson, 1979; Osborn, 1982) . Once the virus has established an infection in these glands however, the same basement membrane protects the infected cells from immunological attack (Henson and Neapolitan, 1970) .",

Likewise, horses appear to be resistant to pseudorabies virus while all other domestic animals are readily affected. On the other hand vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) readily produces disease in horses, as well as in cattle and pigs, but sheep are resistant.

These considerations have given impetus to the concept of breeding virus-resistant strains of fish and mammals. Unfortunately, resistance to a given virus does not guarantee resistance to other, even related, viruses. A good example of this lack of correlation is afforded by mice infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) or murine CMV. Both viruses are herpes viruses, yet the spectrum of resistant and susceptible mouse strains is quite different for the two viruses (Lopez, 1975 (Lopez, , 1980 Chalmer et al., 1977; Kirchner et aL, 1980; Chalmer, 1980) . Furthermore, since viruses themselves are continuously changing, a supposedly virus-resistant breed may not remain resistant to newly emerging strains of the same virus. In this context one should be reminded of the 'ecological flux' existing in the classic laboratory model of a bacteriophage T4-infected culture of Escherichia coli, in which phage-resistant mutants of the E. coli, as they arise, gain a selective advantage in the culture, only to be attacked by mutant phage which have acquired an altered host range (Mathews, 1971) .

H-2 genes are involved to some extent but, at least for MCMV and FLV, non-H-2 genes also contribute to the degree of resistance. In addition the virus genotype can influence the response (Bang and Cody, 1980; Hudson, 1984) . Therefore it is not at all clear at present what is the precise nature of the host and virus genes which determine the outcome of an infection. This is partly due to the unknown functions of the H-2 genes implicated, and partly due to the fact that various other relevant host genes may be unwittingly selected for in addition to the obvious marker genes during animal strain derivations. On the other hand specific viral genes which act as determinants should be easier to identify and analyze. In this connection it has become evident that some specific viral genes can act as determinants by virtue of the interactions of their protein products with cell surface receptors, with the result that only the appropriate interaction leads to successful penetration of the cell. Reoviruses represent good examples of this phenomenon, and this aspect will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.2.1.",

It has been shown that certain viruses, e.g. Semliki forest virus (a togavirus) do require cellular receptors, the presence of which is governed by H-2 genes . Consequently in a mouse containing the appropriate H-2 haplotype SFV would not be able to penetrate fibroblast cells, although conceivably other cell types may not be governed in the same way and hence could still be permissive for virus replication.",

            "text": "The importance of the chicken herpes virus, Marek's disease virus (MDV), has led to attempts to breed a virus-resistant strain of chicken. MDV produces a lymphoproliferative disease which rapidly disseminates and yields tumors in neural and other tissues. The virus is also transmitted readily once it establishes an infection within a flock. It appears that relative resistance to the virus is conferred by the B 2~ haplotype; thus breeding chickens with B 2t should provide a good starting point for MDV resistance, although it is known that other factors, such as sex and age, also influence the degree of resistance (Gavora and Spencer, 1980; Payne, 1982) . Nevertheless, a combination of judicious breeding and the application of good vaccines has raised optimism for the prospect of completely containing MDV among commercial flocks. The optimism may wane however in the face of anticipated mutant MDV strains emerging in the future. 4.1.2.2. Host immune responses. Many host genes, including some H-2 genes, are involved in determining immune responses to virus infections. More details about these responses will be given in Section 5. In the present context it is sufficient to point out that the consequence of virus infection is largely influenced by the immune responses. It is known from studies in humans that genetic deficiencies in humoral or cell mediated responses can render the host particularly susceptible to certain virus infections. Individuals with defects in humoral immunity are very susceptible to those viruses which are dependent upon a phase of viremia for their dissemination, e.g. togaviruses (McLean, 1980) . Arabian horses also fall into this category. These horses are unable to produce gamma globulins and are therefore much more susceptible to some viruses than other breeds of horse (Poppie, 1980) . In contrast individuals with defects in cell mediated immunity have great difficulty in coping with those viruses, such as herpes, which tend to remain cell-associated in the body and are relatively resistant to neutralization by circulating antibodies . Few cases of immune deficiencies among livestock have been documented, although it seems likely that they do exist and may explain some of the individual or breed variation in relative susceptibility to virus-induced disease.",

Many studies have shown that virus replication in cultured cells can be profoundly affected by the presence of hormones and prostaglandins. These effects are generally attributed to alterations in various intracellular biochemical pathways, especially those involving cyclic nucleotides. The end result is a modulation of viral gene expression such that virus replication is then enhanced or inhibited. As one example, herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication in fibroblast cultures is enhanced by agents which increase the cellular concentration of cyclic-GMP, while inhibition results from increased cyclic-AMP (Stanwick et al., 1977) . HSV and HCMV are also affected in different ways by various prostaglandins and hormones added to culture cells (Harbour et al., 1978; Koment, 1985) . Since many hormones and other compounds influence biochemical pathways, and even cellular gene expression, in a variety of target cells in the body, it is likely that the net effect on virus replication will reflect the balance of hormones etc. acting upon particular cell types.",

Probably the most extreme example of this property is the murine CMV, in which virulence is apparently fully reversible (Osborn and Walker, 1971; Osborn, 1982) . If this virus is maintained solely by transferring salivary gland homogenates from mouse to mouse, the virus retains full potency for all murine tissues including salivary glands. However, if the virus is passaged just once in cell culture (i.e. in fibroblast cultures) it becomes attenuated and is no longer able to establish infections in many tissues, except the salivary glands, which still yield normal amounts of virus. Likewise, virus obtained from the spleen or liver is also attenuated and will infect only the salivary glands. Yet once the attenuated virus has been passed through salivary glands again, it becomes fully virulent. To add to the complexity of the situation, more recent studies have revealed that even salivary gland virus released during chronic persistent infection, i.e. after the acute phase, is partly attenuated; but virus which is later reactivated by means of deliberate immunosuppression of the mice is once again fully virulent (Selgrade et al., 1981; Jordan and Takagi, 1983) .

These 'variants' or 'mutants' could be readily identified by their failure to react with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the glycoprotein. The specific mutation was localized to amino-acid number 333 in the protein, which is arginine in the virulent strains, but which had been replaced by isoleucine or glutamine in the attenuated strains. Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed the specificity of the alteration. Presumably these mutations caused configurational changes in the glycoprotein such that the protein could not react properly with the reference monoclonal antibody.

Thus any other amino acid (not necessarily arginine) replacement at this position which would be compatible with the wild-type configuration of the glycoprotein could lead to reversion to virulence.

But of greater economic significance was the recent pandemic of 'flu' in domestic fowl which invaded several states in the USA. Chickens and ducks offered little resistance to this new strain of virus, and as a consequence a total of 15 million birds either died directly from the disease or had to be destroyed in an effort to halt the spread of the virus (Bean et al., 1985) .

This allows the virus to persist in nature. The relative ease of recombination and generation of new strains was demonstrated a few years ago in experiments conducted with turkeys and pigs. In these studies it was shown that two strains of virus could simultaneously infect an individual turkey and give rise to a virulent recombinant strain. Likewise in pigs recombinant strains could also arise and these could be transmitted to additional pigs which then suffered disease (Webster et al., 1973) .",

Restriction endonuclease analysis of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV) isolates from numerous cattle infections in Saskatchewan (Misra et al., 1983) , revealed the presence of types but no variation within types, and no correlation with disease symptoms. Pseudorabies virus (pig herpes) isolates, and feline herpes virus isolates from different countries showed identical DNA restriction patterns (Herrmann et aL, 1984a,b) . It is conceivable that for viruses such as herpes, which have a propensity for lifelong latency, genetic drift offers no selective advantage. Nevertheless hints have been thrown elsewhere in this review that cytomegaloviruses may vary during chronic infection. Thus genetic stability may be a feature of only some herpes viruses. Alternatively, the prolonged controlled growth that occurs during CMV chronic infection within the animal may select for variants, whereas HSV, IBRV, and other herpes viruses which exhibit true latency, i.e. no replication, do not undergo variation. This could be a simple consequence of mutation frequency. Thus, the more rounds of replication a viral genome goes through (as for example the prolonged chronic infections characteristic of CMVs) the greater the rate of mutation. But the potential for variation is definitely present, since studies with equine herpes virus type 1 showed that it does change on repeated passage in animals (Allen et al., 1983a,b) .",

Occasionally, one virus genome is packaged into a capsid of the other virus, or in a capsid comprised of a mixture of capsomers of both viruses. This property is also exhibited by some membrane containing viruses, especially vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and retroviruses (Choppin and Compans, 1970; Zavada, 1982) . In these situations the virus nueleocapsid is enclosed by all the membrane of the other virus. The consequence of these exchanges is that the host range of the novel virus or pseudotype is determined by the capsid or membrane. Thus, if the process occurs in nature it may allow virus genomes to infect abnormal hosts. This could account for the very wide host range of viruses like VSV. However, the frequency of occurrence during natural infection must be very low, since the process requires two distinct viruses simultaneously infecting a single cell, in a tissue composed of millions or even billions of cells. The process could be facilitated when an exogenous virus reactivates, and then recombines with, a latent virus infection such as a retrovirus.",

The mechanism of the interference phenomenon has received considerable study, especially for VSV. It appears that the essential step is the generation of DI(+) RNAs which have the ability to 'sequester' the viral RNA polymerase and hence decrease the overall replication process, resulting in reduced numbers of progeny (-) RNA genomes. The popular explanation for this process is that, during the transit of the replicase along the template (+)strand RNA, the enzyme 'flips' back to the starting point on the template strand, or 'loops' back on the progeny strand, with the result that short pieces of DI RNAs are made continuously, at the expense of full length strands (Perrault, 1981; Lazzarini et al., 1981) .

This, coupled with the apparent absence of a proof-reading mechanism for RNA replication, implies a vastly greater frequency of mutations for RNA genomes. The second reason is that, with a few possible exceptions, viral RNAs do not exist as true latent infections. Thus generally persistent RNA virus infections are accompanied by some replication, with the result that mutations must continue to accumulate throughout persistence. This became evident from the analysis of Holland's VSV-DI system, in which all of the cloned virus isolates were genetically distinct. A notable exception to this rule is the case of retroviruses, where latency and reduced mutation rates are attained by their existence in the form of proviral DNAs.",

This argument in no way detracts from the value of the theoretical and empirical arguments outlined above, but we must remember their limitations. If it were possible to compare a given RNA virus in all the four situations just mentioned, we would probably find that the species of RNA eventually selected would be different in each case, partly because the selection pressures would be different, but also because in the more complex situations the ground rules would be different i.e. there would be some degree of heterogeneity and hydrophobicity in the replication complex.

In fact even serotyping leads to increasing levels of subdivision when monoclonal antibodies are employed. Thus, the traditional exercise of classifying viruses into more and more discrete subgroups simply hides the real process of continual evolution, which generates 'pools' of viral genomes rather than discrete 'types'. It has been recognized that viruses which exist as only one or a few serotypes in the wild may still provide considerable heterogefieity in laboratory serotyping analysis and in their ability to produce disease in animals. On the other hand, DNA viruses may be fitted into discrete serotypes more readily only because their rates of mutation are much slower.",

Within a given tissue there are usually populations of cells which are susceptible to a specific virus while other cells are resistant; but even within the potentially susceptible population there are often cells which will not allow replication of the virus, possibly because of constraints imposed by cell cycles, differentiation, or the myriad BRMs (biological response modulators) bombarding tissues. The precise location of a cell in a tissue may also affect its response to the virus. The Reader could probably think of many examples to illustrate this phenomenon, but the Author is most familiar with murine CMV, which seems to prefer distinctive cell types for replication in each of the many tissues it invades (Hudson, 1979) .

Colostrum of ruminants is particularly rich in selected classes of IgG, in addition to the presence of IgM, IgA, and complement (Butler, 1981a,b) . Lymphocytes and other cell types are also present. The newborn is capable of absorbing these globulins from the colostrum during the first 24 hr after delivery, but not subsequently; therefore it is extremely important that the newborn is allowed to suckle during this period.

This property has been used to explain the dengue-shock syndrome exhibited in individuals following re-exposure to the same virus (Halstead et al., 1980) . Apparently many other viruses can produce ADE, at least in vitro (Porterfield and Cardosa, 1984) . Tdeost fishes possess globulins and react to virus infections by making antibody. There is some controversy as to the types of globulin in the blood, although for the most part they seem to be of the IgM type rather than IgG (Ellis, 1982) .",

These could represent authentic antibodies against latent IPNV infections, or some kind of protein which behaves like a globulin during serum protein purification methods, and which happens to have an affinity for IPNV proteins. Natural antibody has been likened to C-reactive protein, a common constituent of fish and mammalian sera which precipitates cell wall materials of microorganisms (Pilcher and Fryer, 1980a ).

Rainbow trout for example, require 3-4 weeks at a temperature of 15 \u00b0 in order to produce detectable antibody to foreign antigens. In view of this, one has to question the importance of the primary antiviral antibody response in cold water fishes, especially since the fish viruses themselves replicate within fish cell cultures and in fish tissues in vivo with more or less normal kinetics, i.e. similar to analogous mammalian viruses, in spite of the reduced temperatures. The situation is not simple however, since a period of acclimation to a specific temperature before exposure to antigen can accelerate the antibody response (Ellis, 1982) .",

More recently NK cells, which unlike cytotoxic T-cells may only be non-specificaUy augmented by the virus, have been detected in significant numbers within one to two days after virus infection. This has led to the suggestion that the NK cells may be more important in eliminating virus-infected cells early in the infection (Bancroft et al., 1981; Casali and Trinchieri, 1984) . In support of this contention is the evidence from studies of the beige mutant mice, which are defective in NK cell activity and consequently are very susceptible to viruses such as murine CMV (Bancroft et al., 1981) . The current hypothesis is that NK cell activity is indirectly enhanced by interferon which is induced shortly after infection.",

This property is still used as the basis for their measurement. In more recent years however it has become clear that they have additional functions in connection with regulation of cell growth and differentiation including immunologically important cells (Gresser et al., 1979; Billiau, 1983; Moore, 1983; Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1983 ). The rate of synthesis of IFNs in normal healthy cells is generally thought to be very low or non-existent.

The only general conclusions appear to be that, (i) only one or a few molecules of a particular IFN suffice to 'transform' a cell into an 'antiviral' state; (ii) the effects are mediated via membrane receptors (which may be different for different types of IFN, Fig. 5) . After a lapse of several hours, during which time a number of mRNAs and corresponding proteins are synthesized, 'antiviral effects' can be demonstrated (McMahon and Kerr, 1983) . Some viruses, e.g. the papovavirus SV40, are blocked at an early stage in their replication cycle, while many others suffer blocks to transcription and translation. In addition some retroviruses and VSV can be blocked at the stages of virion maturation and release (McMahon and Kerr, 1973) . It is clear from the multitude of reported studies that probably no two combinations of cell and virus work in precisely the same way. Most of these studies were performed with cultured cell lines, and it is important to realize that more recent investigations have revealed a tremendous variation between cell types with regard to their basal content of the several key enzymes and substrates considered to be involved in the IFN-induced mRNA degradation and translation block (see Fig. 6 ). Apart from this all IFNs have other important effects on cellular structures and functions (Taylor-Papadimitriou, 1983) , and many of these may contribute to the fate of the cells, e.g. in determining whether or not the IFN-treated cell will itself survive following blockage of the virus replication. Figure 6 illustrates schematically the principal components of the so-called '2-5A system' which is commonly activated by IFN treatment of cells (Baglioni, 1979; Lengyel, 1981; McMahon and Kerr, 1983) . Among the proteins synthesized, the two best characterized ones are: (i) a protein kinase, which phosphorylates the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor elF2, and thereby prevents further initiation of polypeptide chains. This event may not discriminate between cell and viral mRNAs. Conceivably this kinase has other substrates, not yet identified, which affect other cellular processes; (ii) The 2-5A synthetase, which produces the adenosine nucleotide ppp(A2'p)nA and its oligomers (n > 2). These nucleotides have the property of interfering with DNA and protein synthesis. Different cells contain markedly different base levels of this enzyme, but the level is invariably elevated by IFN.",

In no case has the detailed mechanism been worked out for any virus, but it is clear that different viruses act in different ways (Woodruff and Woodruff, 1976a; Virdizier, 1975; Hudson, 1979; Rouse and Babiuk, 1979; Semenov, 1981; Dcnman et al., 1983) .",

The effects are invariably reversible.

The virus then becomes latent, probably in neurons, and possibly also in glial cells (Wildy et al., 1982) . In this state viral genes may be quiescent (Rock and Fraser, 1983) . The trigeminal ganglion is evidently a common site for latency, since recent studies on unselected cadavers have shown the present of non-replicating viral DNA in this tissue (Lewis et al., 1984) . Similar observations were made recently on feline herpes virus (Gaskell et al., 1985) . An infected neuron is an attractive site from the viral aspect, since these cells do not usually divide in adults and they should be relatively protected from immune surveillance. However proponents of the 'dynamic' hypothesis suggest that some virions intermittently travel back down the nerve fibers to the skin where they can renew their replication if the conditions are 'appropriate'. 'Static' hypothesis proponents maintain that the virus remains within the ganglion until the reactivation stimulus. Additional hypotheses, in which virus is alleged to reside continuously or intermittently in the epithelium, have been proposed Hill and Blythe, 1976; Harbour et al., 1983; Klein, 1985) .",

The submaxillary-passaged virus tends to persist longer in the mouse than does virus repeatedly passaged in fibroblast cultures (Misra, 1977) .

A notable host contribution to MCMV pathogenesis is the histocompatibility gene status, which has been studied extensively by Chalmer (Chalmer et al., 1977; Grundy et al., 1981) . In general the b and d haplotypes confer sensitivity to the virus, sensitivity being dominant in crosses. Other non-H-2 genes also contribute however, and Chalmer has argued for the involvement of at least four genetic loci (two H-2 linked, two non-H-2 linked), some of which correlate with specific histopathological effects in certain tissues (Grundy et al., 1981) . The host strain also influences the duration of the chronic infection. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 , from which it can be seen that the chronic phase is more prolonged, at least in submaxillary glands, in ICR and SWR mice than in C3H. 7.3.1.5. Physical barriers. Conceivably the presence of 'barriers' such as basement membranes could render a tissue or group of cells relatively inaccessible to virus, and to immune responses once infection was estalished. This could explain why salivary glands require a long time to become infected in the first place, and why the infection is then prolonged after this. Henson's group has shown that the duration of the chronic phase in submaxillary glands is inversely related to the efficacy of the inflammatory response. Ultimately the attack on the acini is successful and leads to destruction of infected and adjacent uninfected cells. This process can be alleviated by cortisone, with the result that virus continues to be produced and shed (Henson and Neapolitan, 1970) . 7.3.1.6. Macrophages. Mims and Gould (1978) have shown that peritoneal macrophages and Kiipffer cells can restrict the spread of MCMV, although this restriction was relatively ineffective for salivary gland passaged virus compared with cell-culture passaged virus. This is an important distinction since wild mice presumably are exposed to salivary gland virus. Furthermore, in view of the invariable finding that blood-borne virus is cell associated rather than free virus, then perhaps the importance of the macrophage as a 'guardian' against entry of virus into tissues has been exaggerated. In fact the few macrophages which do become infected in vivo may serve as reservoirs for later re-infection. In support of this concept is the evidence that MCMV can persist in, and can be re-activated from, spleen and peritoneal macrophages following infection in vitro or in vivo Brautigam et al., 1979; Hudson, 1984) .",

Cell differentiation. Recently Dutko and Oldstone (1981) showed that modulation of gene expression in teraocarcinoma cell lines could affect MCMV transcription and replication, the more 'differentiated' state favoring replication. This is relevant to persistent infections since a cell carrying a latent MCMV genome may lose this control if host gene expression is modulated through differentiation or extracellular factors. 7.3.1.8. Cell cycle. Studies in our laboratory (Muller and Hudson, 1977a) indicated that MCMV (like certain other viruses) can only replicate in fibroblasts if they are traversing the cell cycle. Specifically a cellular event associated with early S-phase seems to be required. Other cell types may show a similar requirement. This is relevant to persistent infection since, if a G0-phase fibroblast carries a latent MCMV genome, then any event which forces that fibroblast into the cell cycle may also permit virus replication. (Bancroft et al., 1981) . It is generally assumed that the other immune responses depicted in Fig. 7 are also important in limiting the acute infection, although they do not prevent the establishment of persistent infection. Nevertheless, evidence for a continuing role of the immune system in controlling the virus has been adduced from the many experiments in which immunosuppressive treatments have led to the emergence of infectious virus.",

It has been customary to assume that, if infectious virus cannot be detected in samples of salivary glands or some other tissues, then the animal must be latently infected (or even uninfected). This assumption may not be valid, for two reasons. Firstly, it is possible that the levels of virus produced are relatively low (1-100 PFU per organ) and hence difficult to detect by standard assay techniques. We have sometimes had to assay entire tissues in order to detect a few infectious particles. Secondly, while the virus may be truly latent in a specific tissue, it may concurrently be shed continuously (i.e. a chronic infection) from other tissues. In fact in our experience it has proven notoriously difficult to obtain persistently infected SWR/J mice which were completely free of infectious virus in all tissues assayed, especially if the mice were immature at the time of infection. Probably in the wild the mothers are relatively young adults and therefore still excrete infected saliva, which then infects the newborns. Under these conditions chronic infections would prevail. In addition to these problems, individual mice (even of the same strain) do not all exhibit the same duration of the chronic phase, and consequently the result that some mice in an Gardner et al., 1974 Wu et al., 1975 Cheung and Lang, 1977a Mayo et al., 1977 Jordan et al., 1977 Henson et al., 1972 Olding et al., 1975 Wise et aL, 1979 Cheung and Lang, 1977b Jordan and Mar, 1982 Chantler et al., 1979 Brautigam et al., 1979 Hudson et al., 1979 Muller et al., 1978 Dutko and Oldstone, 1981 experiment are entirely free of infectious virus is no guarantee that the others are also free of virus. These arguments in no way detract from the value of the systems enumerated in Table  5 , however, since the reactivation is obviously abrogating some kind of control system, so that virus replication is elevated, either simultaneously in several tissues, or in one key tissue initially followed by dissemination to others. And it still remains a possibility that certain treatments may reactivate the virus from a latent state in a specific tissue in the face of continuous shedding from another. Thus, some of the models in Table 4 may represent models for elevating the chronic infection rather than for reactivating a true latent infection.",

At one end of the spectrum the viral genome may only express one or a few genes and resultant antigens, while in other cell clones from different individuals several antigens are expressed and viral DNA may replicate. In the extreme case a few clones even produce infectious virions. The cell populations are heterogeneous however in that a few cells may exist at a different level of control from the others. Furthermore the degree of expression can be influenced by extrinsic factors known to modulate gene expression. The extent of methylation of the viral DNA is one cause of this variation (Wolf and Seibl, 1984) .",

This phenomenon of 'tolerance' has long been recognized in immunology. In the case of viruses, the situation may follow infection of an immunologically immature animal. The best known example is the arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which infects rodent species and many other animals. When newborn mice are infected with LCMV, the virus is tolerated and persists lifelong throughout the animal as a chronic infection. Some antibodies are raised and form immune complexes with free virions, but no CMI results; hence the infected cells survive. In the wild the virus is readily maintained by transmission to neonates via various excretions or across the placenta. In this way persistent infection is assured not only within the individual but also within the colony (Lehmann-Grube et al., 1983) .",

In this state the viral DNA can be detected by nucleic acid hybridization techniques, and virus can be rescued by cultivation of brain tissue in vitro.

Unfortunately this is often the limiting factor. In general veterinary virology has tended to lag behind human virology in this regard (although the gap seems to be closing), while fish viral diagnosis has lagged even further. This is partly due to the reluctance of governing authorities to replace some of the conventional and anachronistic techniques with more recent innovative methods, and partly due to the conservatism of the diagnosticians themselves, who are sometimes apprehensive about replacing a time-tested crude method (such as the complement-fixation test) by a novel scientific technique. The cost of a test is also a large factor in determining its acceptability, although methodology based upon the use of monoclonal antibodies and genetic 'probes' will undoubtedly render the newer tests economically attractive in the near future. Table 8 represents a summary of the more commonly Used tests in relation to their speed, sensitivity and specificity (McLean, 1980; Mohanty and Dutta, 1981) . Electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens is by far the quickest technique, and will likely remain so for some years (McLean and Wong, 1984) . If substantial numbers of virions are present in the sample, as is often the case for rotaviruses in stools from children or young animals suffering from diarrhea, then the virus can be seen and thus identified within minutes of receiving the specimen. If respiratory specimens contain substantial numbers of paramyxoviruses, e.g. bovine parainfluenza type 3 in nasal secretions, then again identification can be made quickly (in this case independent confirmation might be required).",

Further confirmation requires an additional serum neutralization or fluorescent antibody test with known antibody. If monoclonal antibodies are used for this purpose, it is important to ensure that they are neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless there are several major disadvantages to the cell culture isolation technique. One of these stems from its extreme sensitivity. Any cytopathogenic virus that is present in the specimen can be detected, regardless of its role, or otherwise, in the disease.

In the extreme situation, some viruses, e.g. the paramyxovirus SV5 (simian virus 5) produce no discernable cpe while they replicate. Of equal concern is the fact that the laboratory must carry numerous cell lines or primary cultures in order to encompass the variety of animal species from which specimens are taken. The human-viral diagnostic laboratory can usually make do with two or three types of primate culture; but obviously the veterinary counterpart must be prepared to deal with a wide range of host specific and broad spectrum viruses.

Thus, at least two consecutive serum samples must be tested, ideally representing the 'acute' and 'convalescent' phases of the disease, in order to implicate the virus as the cause. Needless to say, this entire operation spans too much time to be of any use in helping to design therapeutic measures, and the animal may be dead by the time the diagnosis is completed, although this knowledge could be useful in preventing the spread of infection to the rest of the herd.

If the plasmid is then cut with a suitable restriction enzyme and incubated with the SP6 RNA polymerase, plus ribonucleotides, a faithful transcript (RNA) of the inserted foreign DNA results (Butler and Chamberlain, 1982) . By including a radioactive ribonucleotide or biotin-UTP in the incubation mix, very high specific activity (or biotin-labeled) RNAs can be produced. These RNAs (even eukaryotic ones) can be translated efficiently in vitro and in vivo to give functional proteins (Green et al., 1983; Krainer et al., 1984; Zinn et al., 1983; Maniatis et al., 1982; Melton and Kreig, 1984) .

In addition the use of restriction-endonuclease 'fingerprinting' has already been described (Section 4) and illustrated for adenoviruses and for differentiation between related herpes viruses.

The first report of successful production of VP1 antigenic protein in bacteria appeared in 1981 (Kupper et al., 1981) . Figure 13 illustrates the principal steps involved in the cloning and expression of the VP1 gene in E. coll. The first step involved the synthesis of'double-stranded cDNA (complementary DNA) molecules of most of the viral RNA genome (nearly 8000 nucleotides long), by means of reverse transciptase and E. coli. DNA polymerase. These cDNAs were used to generate restriction endonucleolease maps of the viral genome and to locate the gene for VP1. Suitable cDNAs were then cloned into plasmid pBR322 for amplification and further characterization. Subsequently one of these plasmids, pFMDV-1034, containing the VP1 gene, was restricted to cut the VP1 coding region out of the plasmid vector. The excised piece was then ligated into a different plasmid, p PLc24, in such a way that the VP1 gene was now under the control of the strong lambda phage promoter provided by this plasmid vector. When the final reconstructed plasmid was introduced into an appropriate strain of E. coli the latter produced substantial amounts of VP1 protein fused to the plasmid promoter sequence plus some additional amino acids contributed by the plasmid vector. This polypeptide was able to induce FMDVneutralizing antibodies in animals. A similar procedure was reported by another group (Kleid et al., 1981) . In their case the fragment of eDNA containing most of the VP1 gene was incorporated into a plasmid containing a promoter-operator for the E. coli tryptophan genes. When this recombinant plasmid was introduced into E. coli and the cells were grown under conditions allowing optimal expression of the tryptophan system, a large hybrid protein was made which comprised tryptophan-specific protein plus the VP1 coded protein. This hybrid protein constituted 17% by weight of the total proteins synthesized by the bacteria, and it was able to elicit the production of FMDV-neutralizing antibodies in animals.",

In contrast a large virus (e.g. vaccinia or a similar pox virus) has the advantage of disseminating naturally.

In order to achieve this objective, special plasmids were constructed to contain the vaccinia thymidine kinase (TK) gene, certain control elements, the cluster of restriction endonuclease sites derived from a pUC plasmid, and the 'foreign' viral gene inserted into the TK region. The final chimeric plasmid was introduced into cells infected with wild type vaccinia virus, which then underwent some recombination events with the plasmid TK containing the insert such that the genuine desired recombinant vaccinia virions were devoid of TK activity. These recombinants were easily selected in TK-cells (Mackett et al., 1984) . The Panicali procedure differs in detail but is essentially the same in principle (Panicali and Paoletti, 1982) .

In herpes and pox virus-infected cells a viral-induced enzyme fulfills this function, especially when the host cells are non-dividing cells which have switched off the cellular TK enzyme. Mutants frequently arise which are defective in TK; consequently the compound cannot be phosphorylated, at least to its normal level, and so the virus escapes inhibition. There is evidence that such TK defective mutants are less pathogenic than their wild counterparts; but although this may be a common feature of some mutant viruses (i.e. they may be somewhat attenuated), it may not be universal.",

Its mechanism of action is not understood completely, although in the case of influenza A virus it is clear that an early event in the replication cycle is inhibited. Thus, the adsorption and penetration of the virus into cells proceeds normally but early transcription does not commence. It has been inferred from these results that the uncoating of the virion is blocked (Skehel et al., 1978) . However, before the viral genome can initiate transcription it has to migrate into the cell nucleus, consequently there are a number of potential target sites for antiviral attack apart from the uncoating events Dimmock, 1982; Herz et al., 1981) .",

The level of this enzyme varies tremendously, from very low amounts in mouse and rat cells to large amounts in human and hamster cells. Similarly cell lines vary, e.g. BHK cells have very little; Hep-2 cells have lots (Gentry et al., 1981) . Also many enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism fluctuate with cell-cycle status (Weissbach, 1975; Baserga, 1976) .

By contrast HSV-TK efficiently phosphorylates it, whereupon cellular enzymes produce the triphosphate, which is incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerases. Since the compound contains an acyclic sugar, this effectively blocks elongation of the newly synthesized DNA strand (Shugar, 1980; Ericksson et al., 1981; Field et al., 1981; Shannon, 1984) .

A synthetic compound which has shown promise in this regard is ribavirin (virazole; 1-fl-D-ribofuranosyl-l,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide). This compound structurally resembles guanosine and inosine nucleotides and accordingly competitively interferes with the key steps in the synthesis of GTP and dGTP in ceils. Ribavirin is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase and the resulting monophosphate competitively inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, effectively blocking guanosine and deoxyguanosine triphosphate formation. This would explain the action of ribavirin in decreasing DNA and RNA synthesis in mammalian cells (Muller, 1979; Shugar, 1980; Shannon, 1984) . But in order to explain the selective antiviral effects, which are expressed at much lower ribavirin concentrations, additional mechanisms must operate.",

More details on the naturally-occurring chemicals can be found in the review by Becker (1980) . Thus, the prospects for chemotherapy of a few specific virus infections, notably herpes infections, are good in view of our ability to design chemicals for the specific task of interfering with viral enzymes. Similar approaches may be fruitful for other groups of viruses, e.g. the current attempts to find non-toxic chemicals which interfere specifically in the viral enzyme-directed processing of precursor proteins in the picornaviruses. Blockage of this stage results in the unavailability of functional viral proteins and hence virus replication cannot proceed. But for the majority of viruses, testing is still largely a trial-and-error situation. A brief review of the problem from the standpoint of the veterinarian has been presented by Gustafson (1980) . The related subject of methods of drug delivery to animals, and the pharmacology of such chemicals in healthy and diseased animals, are important features but are outside the scope of this review.

When this conjugate was used it was found that tumor cells in a mouse would bind the conjugate, but that exposure of the animals to intense white light was needed to activate the porphyrin moiety and hence to kill the tumor cells. Thus the combination of a photosensitizer and the antibody provided two important advantages: (i) the desired specificity of the reaction; and (ii) the innocuous nature of the conjugate in the absence of light activation. The term 'photoimmunotherapy' was coined to describe this technique (Mew et al., 1983) .",

Some of the reservations will undoubtedly be either vindicated or cast aside as a result of clinical trials with cloned IFNs. Hopefully some veterinary trials will also be forthcoming, although the prospect of controlling a respiratory infection within a herd of bovines by repeated nasal spray is something the average farmer would probably not relish. It does not seem feasible to attempt administration of IFN via food or water.

Many of them may also act indirectly, in view of the observations that some potent inducers in vivo are ineffective (or marginally active) in cell-culture systems, e.g. tilorone (Mayer and Krueger, 1980) . Some of them may not really be IFN-inducers at all, but may act as immune modulators (see Section 9.8). Table 14 summarizes the desired properties of inducers. In addition to their general lack of species specificity, another advantage that inducers may have over IFN itself is the prospect of local administration without dissemination in the body. This is just as well since most of them have proven to be toxic when given systemically in animals. In any case one would have to question the deliberate introduction of polynucleotides into an animal. But this does of course restrict their usefulness. The greater success has been reported for poly I :poly C in the treatment of herpes-simplex keratitis in animals and humans, although there have been reports of additional successes against some other viruses in animals (Levy, 1980) .",

IMMUNE MODULATORS Immune modulators are substances which either stimulate or suppress one or more elements of the immune system. Immunosuppressive factors induced by viruses have already been discussed in Section 6. The present discussion concerns modulators with potential therapeutic value in virus infections. Few of the known modulators have been exploited to the extent of trials in animals or human subjects (Werner and Zerial, 1984) . This has usually been either because of possible toxic effects or because their mechanism of action is completely unknown. This reluctance to try them out is justifiable in view of our realization that indiscriminate tampering with the immune system is a dangerous thing, since an effect on any component of the system will in general be reflected by a counterbalancing trend so that homeostasis is restored. Therefore unless we know exactly what a compound does to the system it is not wise to proceed too far, in case the result is worse than the original disease. Thus more research is needed into the precise effects of modulators on the immune system, and also into the nature of the disturbances caused by virus infections, especially persistent infections. Only then will it be feasible to 'correct' the deficit by appropriate therapy. In the meantime we are stuck with a trial and error approach.",

NEWCASTLE DISEASE VIRUS (NDV) (LANCASTER, 1981; MOHANTY AND DUTTA, 1981) This virus is a paramyxovirus, unrelated to rinderpest, which is responsible for outbreaks of Newcastle disease in chickens, turkeys, many other birds, and occasionally humans. The economic impact of the virus is felt by owners of the first two species. The virus is essentially worldwide in distribution, although the disease was apparently not recognized before 1926, when it was described in England and in several Asian countries. The ubiquity of the virus has been enhanced and maintained by a combination of several human and non-human factors, notably: the current husbandry practices in the poultry industry; the incompletely-regulated international trade in avian species; and the migratory habits of many birds. In fact no virus could ask for a better opportunity for establishing a global ecological 'niche' in its host species. Although many birds suffer disease as a result of infection, it is generally agreed that some species, such as parrots, may serve as carriers of the virus.",

In general the complete clinical picture of a NDV infection represents the contribution of the virulence and tropism factors, together with host determined factors. It will be interesting to determine if the former factors can be ascribed to specific genes of the virus, by analogy with certain other RNA viruses (see Section 4).

In wild birds however, stress, brought on by a long strenuous flight, or sudden climatic changes, could reactivate a latent or chronic infection. Likewise a domesticated bird might reactivate the virus in response to stressful transportation. In either case the reactivated and excreted virus would be available for transmission to susceptible hosts. In view of these considerations it is worthwhile reiterating the fact that during persistent infections mutants will arise and will be selected for or against depending upon the local environment. Thus 'novel' highly virulent strains could conceivably arise at any time. This may even explain the apparent sudden 'emergence' of NDV in 1926.

In terms of their biological and pathogenetic properties the herpes viruses fall naturally into several subfamily groupings, although detailed classification at present is premature.

The lack of correlation between genome organization and biological properties is particularly well illustrated by recent studies on rodent CMVs. Thus, the rat CMV has internal repeated sequences in its DNA very similar to HCMV, and hence can exist in four orientations (Meijer et al., 1984) . In contrast the guinea pig CMV, which is especially suitable as an animal model for HCMV because of the similarity in biological attributes, has a genome organization more like MCMV, i.e. without internal repeated sequences (Gao and Isom, 1984) .",

FISH RHABDOVIRUSES (PILCHER AND FRYER, 1980a; WOLF, 1976 WOLF, , 1982 Among six documented rhabdoviruses of fish, two have been regularly associated with epizootics of salmonid populations, viz. the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHS, Egtved) in Europe and elsewhere, and the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) in parts of North America. The other apparently less notorious members are the carp viruses: spring viremia of carp (SVC virus) and swim bladder inflammation (SBI virus); pike fry rhabdovirus (PFRV); and the more recently isolated Rio Grand Perch (cichlid) rhabdovirus (Wolf, 1982) . All of these viruses were isolated from fish which had suffered reactivated infections as a consequence of stress.

To some degree these difficulties have been overcome by circumventing the need to handle individuals. The most practical alternative is the use of a bath vaccination, in which groups of fish are immersed in a vaccine containing vessel, from which the animals absorb the killed or live attenuated virus (or protein components) through the skin and gills. Such a technique appears to be successful for bacterial vaccines (Egidius and Anderson, 1979) . The use of spray vaccination, in the manner proposed for chicken vaccination in broilers, should be worth considering. The major obstacle to any kind of vaccine administered via the water route is the inevitable dilution effect.

In fact it has been suggested that this erythrocytic necrosis virus (VEN) might be the cause of the cyclic fluctuations in populations of marine salmonids and herring (Evelyn and Traxler, 1978) . In support of this idea is the known difficulty in obtaining the overtly diseased fish in most years.

To some extent this reflects better and wiser observations, and the availability of numerous cultured cell lines. But it also probably reflects increased stressors (especially pollutants and other results of human intrusions), which are becoming more prevalent in natural waters; as well as increased handling; transportation; forced adaptation to new environments; and unnatural intermingling of species. It is already clear that we can expect the same gamut of viruses, from the same families, as their mammalian and avian counterparts. But in reality the total number of individual piscine viruses, even for just the teleosts, is likely to exceed those of mammals etc. because of the considerably greater number of teleost species (i.e. about 22,000 teleosts compared with 4400 mammalian species). In view of this realization, prospects for vaccination are bleak. Instead it seems more reasonable to think of controlling the viruses, at least on small scales, by judicious chemotherapy. In the wild, fish have managed to contain their infections over the years without help from us, and will hopefully continue to do so if they are permitted to continue breeding.",

If the virus has an RNA genome this can first be transcribed into a cDNA by means of reverse transcdptase (Hyypia et al., 1984; Rotbart et al., 1984). The routine production of adequate amounts of the viral DNA, or cDNA, can be achieved by propagation of the cloned genome or genome fragment in a plasmid or phage vector. The versatility of the method should allow for the production of different family-specific, genus-specific or species-specific probes, as dictated by the portion of the viral genome used. For example, a fraction of the coxackievirus B3 viral genome is shared with other human enteroviruses, thus permitting a piece of cloned cDNA to be used as an enterovirus-probe (Hyypia et al., 1984; Rotbart et al., 1984).
