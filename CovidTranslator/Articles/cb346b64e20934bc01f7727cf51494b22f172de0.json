However, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and \u03b1-chloralose) on urodynamic (\u0394pressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [\u2206HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. \u0394pressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with \u03b1-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with \u03b1chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller \u0394HR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.",

Temporary catheter placement for urodynamic trials necessitates the administration of anesthetic agents 8 that interfere with autonomic reflexes to varying degrees 9, 10 .

However, in a rat study, dexmedetomidine was inhibitory to the volume evoked micturition reflex and peak pressure compared to urethane and awake trials 13 . Propofol, an anesthetic agent used to facilitate CMG testing in clinical veterinary medicine 14, 15 , has not been compared directly to dexmedetomidine in cat trials, but is suspected to be less inhibitory than dexmedetomidine due to its mechanism of action (propofol has no analgesic properties, while dexmedetomidine does) and ability to carefully titrate anesthetic depth through intravenous [IV] infusion. Unfortunately, propofol can 3 only be given IV, so it often requires another agent to secure IV access. Alfaxalone, recently approved in the United States for use in cats, has a similar mechanism of action and clinical application as propofol, but has not been used in cats in the context of urodynamic studies. Unlike propofol, alfaxalone is formulated for IM dosing and does not require an additional agent 16 .",

While this may be attributed to the lighter plane of anesthesia under propofol (general anesthetics depresses Pdet(max) in a dose-dependent manner 3,14 ), a human study showed that even under comparable anesthetic depth, propofol showed less suppression of cortical somatosensory evoked potentials compared to isoflurane 24 . Alternatively, the increase in \u0394pressure may be related to loss of function and initiation of the voiding reflex under propofol, as evidenced by bladder slopes drastically different from the awake state.

In contrast, pressure slopes under propofol had the most obvious change from the awake slope, characterized by an early rapid rise and less obvious void event. Although there are no standardized criteria for defining passive filling and active contraction, we found propofol consistently reached a higher normalized pressure compared to dexmedetomidine across normalized time, with the most obvious separation noted between 900 -950 normalized time, where the mean normalized pressure \u00b1 standard deviation range of dexmedetomidine is distinctly separate from the corresponding range for propofol (Fig. 2a) . A previous rat study using a single anesthetic agent (tiletamine-zolazepam) at varying doses found lighter anesthesia was associated with more awake-like bladder curves 32 . However, our study found dexmedetomidine (deeper plane of anesthesia) was associated with more awake-like bladder responses compared to GABA-ergic agonists with a lighter plane of anesthesia.

However, another concurrent explanation for increased heart rate under the GABA-ergic agonists is hypotension with reflex tachycardia 36 . This is in contrast with dexmedetomidine, which causes vasoconstriction, leading to hypertension and reflex bradycardia 16 .

            "text": "Bladder pressure data was processed using MATLAB (R2019a, MathWorks, Natick, MA) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Bladder pressure was smoothed using a 1 second moving average. NVCs were identified in MATLAB using the findpeaks function, defining a peak as at least 3 cm H2O, at least 0.5 seconds away from another peak, and then manually 9 confirmed. To account for the range of trial lengths, NVC counts were divided by the total length of the trial to calculate NVCs per second. To quantify overall bladder pressure trends seen between agents, pressure slopes were calculated for three distinct time periods: (1) infusion start to 100 seconds before void, (2) 100 to 50 seconds before void, and (3) last 50 seconds before void. To visualize the changes seen during slope calculations over different pressure and time ranges across cats and test sessions, the bladder pressure was normalized from 0 (start) to peak/void (1000) on the x (time) axis. After noting that pressures did not significantly fluctuate from resting baseline pressure until about 675 normalized time units, the 675-1000 normalized time unit range was targeted, and the pressure was normalized from 0 to 1 within that window. Continuous heart rate readings during non-terminal trials for the last 3 cats were also processed similarly, but over the entire length of the trial. Statistics were analyzed using JMP Pro 14.2.0 (SAS Institution Inc. Cary, NC), using a mixed model approach, setting anesthetic agent as a fixed variable and animal as a random variable. For analysis of bladder capacity, the cat weight was set as an additional fixed variable. Nominal categorical data was converted to ordinal categorical data in order to fit the mixed model. Yes/some/no, tight/mid/loose, and constricted/mid/dilated were converted to 0/0.5/1 respectively. Pairwise comparisons were made using Tukey's HSD. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. Where relevant, data is reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.",

Cats were implanted with VAPs and anesthetized at the lowest doses necessary to facilitate urodynamic testing. At least 3 sessions of propofol, dexmedetomidine, and alfaxalone each were conducted, in addition to a terminal experiment under isoflurane and \u03b1-chloralose in conjunction with another study. During anesthetized sessions at least 2 CMG trials were performed in each session to assess urodynamic parameters. Heart rate and reflexes were used to assess anesthetic depth, and time to induction/recovery was noted.",
