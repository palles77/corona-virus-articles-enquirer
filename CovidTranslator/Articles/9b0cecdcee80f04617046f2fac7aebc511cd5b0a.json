            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease caused by the human coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The main viral protease, SARS 3CL pro is a validated target for the development of antiviral therapies. Since the enzyme is a homodimer and the individual monomers are inactive, two approaches are being used to develop inhibitors: enzyme activity inhibitors that target the active site and dimerization inhibitors. Dimerization inhibitors are usually targeted to the dimerization interface and need to compete with the attractive forces between subunits in order to be effective. In this paper, we show that the dimerization of SARS 3CL pro is also under allosteric control and that additional and energetically more favorable target sites away from the dimerization interface may also lead to subunit dissociation. We previously identified a cluster of conserved serine residues (Ser139, Ser144 and Ser147) located adjacent to the active site of 3CL pro that could effectively be targeted to inactivate the protease. Mutation of any of these serine residues to alanine had a debilitating effect on the catalytic activity of 3CL pro . In particular, the mutation of Ser147, which does not make any contact with the opposing subunit and is located approximately 9\u00c5 away from the dimer interface, totally inhibited dimerization and resulted in a complete loss of enzymatic activity. The finding that residues away from the dimer interface are able to control dimerization, defines alternative targets for the design of dimerization inhibitors.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an upper respiratory tract disease caused by a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV (1) (2) (3) . Since the emergence of the virus in late 2002, over 8,000 people have been infected, resulting in a mortality exceeding 50% for patients over age 65 with an estimated 10% mortality overall. Currently there are no effective treatments available against SARS. The recent identification of a SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) circulating in the Chinese horseshoe bat population emphasizes the possibility of a reemergence of infection, calling for the development of antiviral therapies targeting SARS-CoV (4) . The SARS-CoV main protease, 3CL pro (also called M pro ) has been identified as a key target for drug development. SARS 3CL pro plays a pivotal role in the life cycle of the coronavirus by the extensive proteolytic processing of two highly conserved polyproteins: pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa), which encode for essential viral replicase proteins. The functional importance of 3CL pro in the coronavirus life cycle makes it a highly attractive target for drug design. Several types of small molecule inhibitors targeting 3CL pro have been identified either by highthroughput screening, computational docking or structure-based drug design, some of which include bifunctional aryl boronic acid compounds, substrate analogue inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors and dimerization inhibitors based on the N-terminal residues of 3CL pro (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

Each monomer consists of three domains and contains a catalytic dyad of His41 and Cys145 located in a cleft between the first two domains. A water molecule is hydrogen bonded to His41; a position usually occupied by the third member of the catalytic triad in other cysteine proteases (18, 20, 21) . The catalytic residues lie within a chymotrypsin-like double \u03b2-barrel fold comprised of the first two domains of the protein (residues 1-184). The catalytic domains are connected by a long loop region (residues 185-200) to a third globular domain composed of five anti-parallel \u03b1-helices (residues 201-306). A surface area of ~2300 \u00c5 (~1250\u00c5 apolar and 950\u00c5 polar) is buried at the dimer interface. The N-terminus, or \"N-finger\", comprised of residues 1-8 makes extensive interactions with the second domain of the parent protomer and the third domain of the opposing monomer near the active site, thereby preserving the shape of the S1 pocket through hydrogen bond interactions with the oxyanion loop (18, 19) . The positioning of these residues prompted speculation that the N-terminus is likely to be important in mediating dimerization and enzymatic activity of 3CL pro (18) (19) (20) (21) . The third alpha helical domain has also been proposed to mediate dimerization and substrate recognition either through positioning of the N-terminus or by holding domain two and the long loop connected to the third domain in a catalytically competent orientation (18, (20) (21) (22) .",

The enzyme exists as a dimer in solution over a wide range of concentrations (12, (24) (25) (26) (27) . Reported dimerization dissociation constants (K d ) for SARS 3CL pro range from low nanomolar affinities (~0.35 nM) to high micromolar affinities (~230 \u03bcM). Differences in the values depend on the technique used to measure the K d as well as the presence of N-or Cterminal extensions or affinity tags. In addition, handling of the protease during purification and storage appears to significantly affect the overall stability of the protease, thereby affecting activity and dimerization measurements.",

            "text": "Residues at the dimer interface that are essential for SARS 3CL pro dimerization and activity have been identified by several groups. The N-and C-termini of the protease are important for maintaining the oligomeric state of 3CL pro , with the majority of interactions being either ionic or hydrophobic. Chou et al (26) observed that both enzyme dimerization and activity decrease at higher salt concentrations and at lower pH, and that a salt bridge between Arg4 and Glu290 was important for these interactions. Mutation of Glu290 to Ala resulted in a complete loss of dimerization and activity while a mutation in Arg4 resulted in an approximately five-fold loss in dimerization and only a moderate loss of activity. Another study showed that deletion of the first three residues of the N-terminus resulted in only a moderate loss in activity and dimerization, while deletion of the first four residues of the N-terminus resulted in a dramatic loss in both areas, supporting the importance of Arg4 (28) . Furthermore, it has been observed that deletion of the first seven residues at the N-terminus of 3CL pro interfered with protease activity and dimerization (16, 28) , though one group reported diminished activity but no change in oligomeric state when the same mutation was made (29) . Mutation of Met6 to Ala completely interferes with both dimerization and enzymatic activity (16) . Met6 is proposed to form hydrophobic interactions with Tyr126 and Phe140 of the opposing chain. In addition, two peptides derived from the N-terminus of the protein have been shown to inhibit the activity of 3CL pro , one of which has been shown to prevent dimerization, supporting the idea that the Nterminus plays a role in maintaining the oligomeric state of 3CL pro (8, 16) . Deletion of the third alpha helical domain also interferes with dimerization and activity [ (27) (28) (29) and unpublished data from this laboratory]. The third domain alone has been observed to dimerize on its own, leading to the hypothesis that the role of this domain may be the regulation of enzymatic activity through dimerization (27) .",

The catalytic activities of wild type 3CL pro and the mutants S139A, S144A and S147A were measured at 1 \u03bcM enzyme concentration using a fluorescence-based cleavage assay in order to obtain the catalytic rate constants (k cat ) and the Michaelis constant (K m ). The results are shown in Figure 2 . The wild type 3CL pro has a K m of 56.42 \u00b1 9.18 \u03bcM and a k cat of 0.643 \u00b1 0.051 sec \u22121 . The resulting K m and k cat are of the same magnitude as those previously reported with the same substrate (24) . Table 1 shows the kinetic parameters obtained for wild type, S139A, S144A and S147A. All of the proteases exhibited very similar K m 's, suggesting that their ability to bind the substrate with similar affinities was not impaired. S139A had a catalytic constant, k cat , similar to the wild type while the S144A value was about half. The most significant effect was observed for S147A which had a 160-fold drop in k cat with respect to the wild type enzyme. Consistent with previously published observations (23, 33) , the activity of the wild type SARS 3CL pro and the three mutants showed a linear correlation with increasing enzyme concentration as shown in Figure 3 .",

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the heat capacity function of wild type 3CL pro , S139A, S144A and S147A at pH 7.4 and 10 mM NaCl. The denaturation transition for wild type 3CL pro is centered at 56.50 \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C at a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/mL (5.9 \u03bcM) and temperature scanning rate (1\u00b0C/min) used in these experiments. This value is approximately 4\u00b0C higher than our previously reported value (5) which was measured using a construct containing five additional amino acids at the N-terminus of the protein. The transition temperature is similar to the value obtained by circular dichroism (CD) (27) , but lower than others reported values (~60\u00b0C) obtained at faster scanning rates (29) , as expected for irreversible denaturation. The S139A mutant had a slight effect on the stability on the protease with a downward shift in T m of 0.9\u00b0C. The S144A mutation resulted in a 1.9\u00b0C upward shift in the transition temperature. The S147A mutation resulted in a downward shift in the transition temperature of approximately 1.7\u00b0C. Besides the changes in denaturation temperature, these experiments confirmed that all four proteins were properly folded and indicate that the serine to alanine mutations did not significantly affect the overall stability of the recombinant proteins. Furthermore, similar results were obtained throughout the length of time required for other experiments (e.g. sedimentation equilibrium measurements) confirming the structural integrity of the proteins in all experiments presented here. The areas under the curves, \u0394H, were also similar for all proteins, indicating the absence of any significant structural changes. A full thermodynamic analysis could not be performed with any of the proteins due to precipitation once the transitions were complete which lead to a lack of reversibility in the microcalorimetric scans. This irreversibility was observed regardless of buffer conditions used (pH values between 3 and 9; NaCl concentrations between 0 and 3M).",

Figure 5 shows typical sedimentation velocity profiles at 0.5mg/ml (14.8 \u03bcM) obtained using direct boundary modeling with the program SEDFIT (30) . The experimental data is well accounted for by the continuous sedimentation coefficient model, c(s), as indicated by the plot of the residuals in Figure 5B . The sedimentation data for wild type 3CL pro in Figure 5C shows the presence of two peaks, at S 1 = 2.5 and S 2 = 4.0. These results are consistent with previous reported values in the literature (16, 26, 28) . There did not appear to be a concentration dependence of the peak positions of c(s) in the concentration range tested. Similar results were obtained for the S139A and S144A proteins, shown in figures 5D and 5E. Despite being located directly at the dimer interface, Serine 139 does not play a dominating role in enzyme dimerization. Similarly, even though kinetic measurements show that S144A is less active than the wild type, the sedimentation profile was similar, albeit with a slight decrease in dimer population, suggesting that this mutation directly affects catalysis. Like the wild type, neither of these mutants showed a concentration dependence on the peak position of c(s).",

Figure 6 shows the results of the global fitting of each set of data at 0.5 mg/ml (14.8 \u03bcM). All sets of experimental data fit well to the monomer-dimer model; the molecular weight obtained for the wild type monomeric species was 33,889 \u00b1 441 daltons, which correlates exceedingly well with the expected monomeric weight of 33,846 kDa as estimated by the protein sequence. The dissociation constant for the wild type 3CL pro dimer was determined to be 1.3 \u00b1 1.8 \u03bcM, which is slightly higher than previously reported values of 0.19 \u03bcM (26) and 0.28 \u03bcM (28) obtained using sedimentation velocity, and slightly lower than a recently reported K d value of 14 \u03bcM obtained also by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation (16) . The slight discrepancy between the two sedimentation equilibrium measurements may be due to the extra amino acid on the N-terminus of the protein used in the previously published work. It has been observed that additional amino acids on the N-terminus of the protease can increase the measured K d value or interfere with dimerization completely [(34) and unpublished data from this laboratory]. If additional amino acids corresponding to a 3CL pro cleavage site are added to the N-terminus of the protein, the protein is able to cleave them off through transprocessing, albeit with a lower dimerization K d . If the added residues do not correspond to a cleavage site, as with the previously published sedimentation equilibrium experiments, then the extra residue cannot be cleaved off and may have an effect on the dimerization K d .",

We examined the effects of separately mutating each of these residues to alanine on the activity, stability and oligomeric state of the protease using a fluorescence-based cleavage assay, differential scanning calorimetry, sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and sedimentation equilibrium sedimentation. Ser139, which makes interactions at the dimer interface, does not appear to play a significant role in maintaining the dimeric state of the protease, showing only slight decrease in activity, thermal stability and dimerization as compared to wild type 3CL pro when mutated to alanine. Ser144, located closer to the active site cavity, showed a twofold decrease in catalytic efficiency when mutated to alanine compared to that of the wild type, but maintained a similar dimeric state and showed an increase in thermal stability by 1.9\u00b0C. Mutation of Ser147, located approximately 9 \u00c5 away from the dimer interface, to alanine resulted in an approximately 150-fold loss in catalytic efficiency in comparison to the wild type, and an inability of the protease to dimerize. This demonstrates that dimerization in SARS 3CL pro can be controlled by long range cooperative interactions, suggesting that targeting cavities nearby Ser147 with small molecule inhibitors may provide an alternative way of inactivating the protease.",

The side chain hydroxyl of Ser144 forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain and backbone of Asn142. The backbone carbonyl of Ser144 interacts with the backbone amide of Ser147, and the side chain of Asn28. Mutation of Ser 144 to Ala results in a more structurally stable enzyme as reflected in the calorimetric data. The K m and the dimerization constant remain essentially the same while the catalytic constant, k cat , is reduced by half, suggesting that the structural rearrangement induced by the mutant reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.",

            "text": "The Ser147 to Ala mutation induces the most dramatic activity and structural effects even though this residue is 9\u00c5 away from the dimer interface. Ser147 makes several backbone and side chain interactions with residues which are involved in an extensive hydrogen bonding network within domains I and II in the protein. The backbone of Ser147 interacts with the backbones of residues Ser144 and His163. Incidentally, His163 is important for catalytic activity, since it comprises the S1 subsite that contributes to the specificity of substrate binding (18) . The side chain of Ser147 makes two interactions with surrounding residues. The side chain hydroxyl of Ser147 hydrogen bonds to the backbones of Cys117 and Ser144. Cys117 forms two additional hydrogen bonds with Asn28 and Leu115. Asn28 may be important in maintaining the structural integrity in and around the active site region of the protease. This residue makes several key interactions, including two interactions with the backbone carbonyl of the catalytic residue Cys145. The hydrogen bonds made by Asn28 to the backbones of Cys117 and Gly120 may be critical in maintaining the position of the beta strand on which they reside, which is connected to and runs anti-parallel to the beta strand containing Tyr126. In turn, Tyr126 forms a hydrophobic pocket with Phe140 of the same chain and Met6 of the opposing chain. Met6 is the closest residue of the opposing monomer to Ser147, which is positioned approximately 9\u00c5 away. As previously mentioned, there is evidence suggesting that Met6 plays a role in maintaining dimerization, potentially through this hydrophobic interaction with Tyr126 and Phe140 (16) . The loss of Asn28 interactions with Cys117 and Gly120 may result in the repositioning of this beta sheet and the disruption of this hydrophobic interaction. Additionally, structural rearrangements due to the loss of these interactions may also interfere with the hydrogen bond that Asn28 makes with the backbone carbonyl Gly143. Gly143 lies at the top of the loop which contains Phe140 which is part of the hydrophobic pocket. Furthermore, the elimination of the hydroxyl group in the S147A mutation not only eliminates the hydrogen bonds made by this group but also allows some rearrangements due to the smaller van der Waals volume of the Ala mutation.",
