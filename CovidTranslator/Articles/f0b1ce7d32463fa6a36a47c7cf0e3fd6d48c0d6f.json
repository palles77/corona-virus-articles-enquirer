Recent studies revealed that M protein could interact with N protein in the Golgi complex. In this study, we showed that SCoV M protein co-localized in the Golgi apparatus with a Golgi vector marker. To study M protein function, three candidate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to M gene sequences were designed, transcribed in vitro, and then tested for their ability to silence M protein expression. The plasmid, pEGFP-M, encoding SCoV M protein as a fusion protein with EGFP, was used for silencing and for reporter gene detection in HEK 293T cells transfected with siRNA constructs. The results showed that the mean green fluorescence intensity and M RNA transcripts were significantly reduced, and that the expression of M glycoprotein was strongly inhibited in those cells co-transfected with M-specific siRNAs. These findings demonstrated that the three M-specific siRNAs were able to specifically and effectively inhibit M glycoprotein expression in cultured cells by blocking the accumulation of mRNA, which provides an approach for studies on the functions of M protein and for the development of novel prophylactic or therapeutic agents for SCoV infection.",

RNAase III specific siRNA targeting the RNA dependant RNA polymerase (RDRP), or the S and N genes, could induce specific degradation of SCoV mRNAs in human cells (Zhu et al., 2004) . Synthesized shRNA targeting the N protein (Tao et al., 2005) and RDRP (Lu et al., 2004) , could inhibit the expression of target protein, and the latter significantly reducing the plaque forming ability of SCoV in Vero-E6 cells. siRNA targeting the E, M and N proteins , leader sequence, TRS, 3 -UTR or the S gene Qin et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004) could effectively inhibit the expression of these targets. Plasmid-derived siRNA targeting to RDRP (Meng et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2004) , the leader sequence (B.J. T. Li et al., 2005) , and to the non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) could specifically inhibit the expression of target protein and also suppress the replication and propagation of SCoV in cultured Vero E6 cell lines (Ni et al., 2005) . The effect of siRNAs/shRNAs probably resulted in global reduction of subgenome synthesis and subsequent protein expression of SCoV. Therefore, to screen more valid siRNAs targets in SCoV genome will be important to provide more information for the development of better SCoV prophylaxis and therapy.",

The PCR conditions were denaturation (98 \u2022 C, 10 s), annealing (55 \u2022 C, 10 s) and extension (72 \u2022 C, 40 s) for 30 cycles.

After incubation at 37 \u2022 C for 2 h, sense and antisense RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both transcription reactions and incubating at 37 \u2022 C overnight. The concentration of the generated dsRNA was measured by the absorbance at 260 nm in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). S1 nuclease and RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 1 U/g of siRNA, respectively, for the digestion of ssRNA and dsDNA. siRNAs were assessed by RNA gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose.",

The primers (forward primer, 5 -TTGGTGCTGTGATCATTCGT-3 ; reverse primer, 5 -AAAGCGTTCGTGATGTAGCC-3 ) for SCoV M gene were used for the semi-quantitative RT-PCR reaction as follows: denaturation (94 \u2022 C, 55 s), annealing (56 \u2022 C, 55 s) and extension (72 \u2022 C, 1 min) for 20 cycles.

Using confocal microscopy, the results verified that the M-EGFP fusion protein was predominantly located in Golgi compartments (Fig. 1) , which is consistent with previous studies (Nal et al., 2005) . However, the correct protein band could not be detected by Western blotting analysis when the regular cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Triton X-100, 1 g/ml aprotinin and 100 g/ml PMSF) was used (data not shown). It was speculated that this failure in detection may be due to its membrane-binding property (Klumperman et al., 1994) . Therefore, an alternative method was adopted using 1% SDS to lyse the cells expressing SCoV M protein.",

Although siRNAs can be acquired through several methods (Donze and Picard, 2002; Miyagishi and Taira, 2002; Yang et al., 2002; Svoboda et al., 2001; Sui et al., 2002; Lois et al., 2002; Rubinson et al., 2003) , transcription in vitro by T7 polymerase is more convenient and reliable than other approaches. Furthermore, the applications of these specifically designed siRNAs, 19-23 nt in length, in animal models have recently made great progress, including the siRNAs targeting Hepatitis B Virus (Xuan et al., 2006) , Japanese Encephalitis Virus (Murakami et al., 2005) , Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Ping et al., 2004) . Based on the extensive screening of the effective siRNAs in vitro, some proper modifications were adopted to improve the efficacy and duration of siRNAs for additional in vivo use. For example, endoribonuclease-prepared siRNAs can efficiently inhibit HBV replication in a mouse model (Xuan et al., 2006) , which might be a better therapeutic agent to fight against HBV. siRNAs have also been pursued for the control of SARS (De Clercq, 2006) . Some potent siRNA inhibitors of SCoV in vitro were further evaluated for efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque SARS model using clinically viable delivery while comparing three dosing regimens. The results showed that specific siRNA could mediate anti-SARS effects either prophylactically or therapeutically, suggesting that a clinical investigation is warranted. This work underscores the prospects for siRNA to enable a significant reduction in development time for new targeted therapeutic agents (B.J. T. Li et al., 2005) .",

These data suggested that the effect of gene silencing induced by siRNA should be sequence specific and entire open reading frame (ORF) based. The siRNAs transcribed in vitro can effectively down-regulate SCoV M RNA and protein levels, corresponding to the reported mechanism that siRNAs degrade target mRNA. The resulting three SCoV M specific siRNAs in this study were different from active siRNA reported by other labs (He et al., 2006) , suggesting that these effective siR-NAs could be further explored as a more efficacious therapeutic agents for SCoV infection.",

The percentage of the cell population that exceeded the fluorescence intensity of the control cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of this population were calculated. The results represent the means of three independent experiments.rescence cell population and mean fluorescence intensity were reduced about 1.5-and 3.0-fold for M-siRNA1, 1.9-and 3.7fold for M-siRNA2 and 2.2-and 5.0-fold for M-siRNA3. This result was in keeping with the fluorescence imaging shown inFig. 4.To further determine the effectiveness of siRNA, transfected cells were examined for M-EGFP fusion protein levels in the presence or absence of siRNAs. Western blot analysis showed that compared with the cells transfected with plasmid pEGFP-M alone, M-EGFP fusion protein expression was reduced in cells cotransfected with EGFP-siRNA, M-siRNA1, M-siRNA2 or M-siRNA3, but not reduced in cells cotransfected with control siRNA (upper panel inFig. 6).
