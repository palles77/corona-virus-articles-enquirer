Up to 30% of childhood pharyngitis is caused by GAS. Outbreaks occur during winter and early spring in the 5-year-old to 15-year-old age group, and spread by close contact (school and home). GAS is uncommon in preschool-aged children and adults. Group C and G beta-hemolytic Streptococcus causes pharyngitis in older children and adults. 3 The infection is similar but less severe and does not lead to the significant complications of GAS infection. Consider mycoplasma and chlamydia infections when young adults present with pharyngitis and bronchitis. 4 Fusobacterium necrophorum (Fn), an obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacillus, has been reported as causing pharyngitis in adolescents in the United Kingdom and Denmark. 3 Although not a conclusive pathogen for pharyngitis, it has been suggested as a causative agent in Lemierre syndrome (septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with septic emboli to the lungs).",

Although the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends empiric treatment of individuals with 4 positive criteria, the IDSA and the American Heart Association (AHA) do not. 5 Routine empiric treatment of GAS in patients with 4 criteria increases unnecessary use of antibiotics by up to 50%. 7 If the clinical symptoms suggest GAS infection, throat culture, rapid antigen detection testing (RADT), or DNA probe testing is indicated. [8] [9] [10] The specimen should be obtained before the initiation of antibiotics, because even 1 dose can cause the test to be negative.

The use of glucocorticoids for the treatment of pharyngitis is controversial. The IDSA recommends against the use of glucocorticoids for decreasing the duration of pain. 5 Glucocorticoids should be restricted to the exceptional patient with severe sore throat or inability to swallow. 12, 13 A single dose of oral dexamethasone of 0.6 mg/kg, maximum of 10 mg is recommended. 14 In adults, a single dose of prednisone 60 mg for 1 to 2 days is acceptable. 12 Antibiotics GAS Penicillin remains the antibiotic of choice of GAS pharyngitis ( Table 3) . Resistance has not developed to penicillin. There are strains of GAS that have developed tolerance with minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 32. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Amoxicillin can replace penicillin for treatment, because it has a better taste than penicillin in the oral form. In patients allergic to penicillin, a first-generation cephalosporin or macrolide may be substituted. There are high rates of resistance to macrolides. Antibiotics should be given for 10 days to eradicate GAS from the pharynx. 15 At this time, short-course treatment cannot be recommended except for cefpodoxime, cefdinir, or azithromycin. 15 In most European guidelines, treatment of GAS is with symptomatic treatment alone. 16 It is considered a self-limiting disease and antibiotics are not commonly recommended because they provide only moderate clinical benefits in a disease with low complication rates. Antibiotics are only prescribed for severe cases. There is a growing body of evidence that treating all patients with GAS pharyngitis to prevent a rare case of RF is not clinically prudent. 8 Penicillin anaphylaxis occurs in approximately 0.015% of patients, with a fatality rate from shock of 0.002%. Overall morbidity from 10 days of antibiotics may be as high as 10%.",

It is not recommended to obtain RADT or throat culture after the second course of antibiotics. If there is a concern that GAS is being spread among close contacts, all close contacts should be tested for GAS and those who are positive should be treated. Family pets are not reservoirs and do not spread GAS. The IDSA does not recommend tonsillectomy solely to reduce the frequency of GAS pharyngitis. 5 Tonsillectomy provides a short-lived benefit for a small fraction of patients. 18 However, many clinicians consider tonsillectomy if a child is severely affected by GAS pharyngitis (ie, 7 or more documented GAS infections within 1 year, 5 or more within 2 years, or 3 or more within 3 years). 18 Other indications for tonsillectomy include tonsillar obstruction, recurrent peritonsillar abscess, and chronic GAS carrier in close contact with a patient who has had RF. 18 ",
