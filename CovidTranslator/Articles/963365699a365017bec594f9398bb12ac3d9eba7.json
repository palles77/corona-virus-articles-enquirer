Although there are similarities in the clinical syndromes caused by the many viruses capable of infecting and causing disease in the human respiratory tract, they possess varying transmission patterns among humans. The mode or modes by which a virus transmits from person to person are critical to understanding how the environment in which they transmit impacts personto-person spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consensus definition for the modes of transmission of influenza virus is broadly applicable to other respiratory (i.e. non-vector-borne) viruses as well (Box 1). In this review, for consistency, we will adhere to the CDC terminology; thus, 'contact transmission' encompasses both direct and indirect transmission, while 'airborne transmission,' comprising both droplet spray and aerosol modes, describes the direct inoculation of virus particles from the air into the respiratory tract without an intermediate.",

In the early 1960s, Schulman and Kilbourne developed an influenza virus transmission model in mice. Although mouse-to-mouse transmission is relatively inefficient, they still observed a significant decrease in transmission efficiency with increasing relative humidity (RH) [ Transmission of viruses via airborne routes may be affected by ambient humidity, which affects not only the virus' stability but also respiratory droplet size, as water content evaporates. In turn, droplet size influences whether the particle will quickly settle to the ground or remain airborne long enough to be inhaled into the respiratory tract of a susceptible host. [20 ] . However, these data should not be overinterpreted, as aerosol generation protocols and thus particle size and composition were not necessarily uniform across experiments.",

Several large-scale studies have been conducted in tropical and equatorial countries in order to determine the relationship between rainfall and respiratory disease, particularly that associated with RSV and, to a lesser extent, influenza virus. A 3year study of RSV infections in Lombok, Indonesia (88S) found an association between rainfall and RSV hospitalizations; interestingly, total monthly precipitation was less important than the number of days on which it rained [39] . In a study from 1982 to 1997 in Malaysia (48N) involving over 5000 children, Chan et al. also documented a significant correlation between number of rainy days and RSV infection [40] . An association between rain and RSV infection has also been seen in several other studies [41] [42] [43] [44] . By contrast, a large, 3378-children study in Northern Taiwan (238N) did not find any association between rainfall and RSV infection [45 ] , nor did a 2002 study in Santiago, Chile (338S). Of note, however, the Chilean study focused on cases in just one public pediatric hospital [46] ; it is possible that a limited sampling of cases in only one hospital would hinder the ability to draw statistically significant conclusions. However, studies in other locations have found the relationship between RSV disease and rainfall to be inversely related. In a 24-month study of over 1000 symptomatic children in India (228N), RSV infection rates were negatively correlated with millimeters of rainfall; these findings were statistically significant [47] .",

Following a 43-month study in Fortaleza (38S), in the northeast of Brazil, an association between rainfall and RSV infection was documented [48] ; Nasciemento-Carvalho et al. reported a similar correlation in Salvadore (128N) [49] . However, RSV infection did not correlate with the rainy season in Sao Paolo (238N) [50] . While these studies employed varying techniques and collected samples over different time periods, it is possible that rain plays a unique role in RSV infection depending on a variety of factors, including geographic location. In addition, weather-dependent behavioral factors such as crowding following rainfall could also influence RSV infection rates [51] , as RSV is thought to transmit through direct or indirect contact [7 ]. Indeed, family structure, living conditions and person-toperson contact are risk factors for RSV infection [51, 52] .",

These findings are in agreement with earlier studies by Rao and Banerjee, who reported a statistically significant association between rainfall and influenza virus infection, though the relative contribution to influenza A or B virus infection was not determined [53] . While it has been noted that peak influenza virus activity coincided with the first rainfall in Chennai, India (138N) [54] , the study lacked sufficient statistical rigor to determine if a relationship in fact exists. In a fairly limited study of pediatric influenza virus infections in an urban slum in Bangladesh (238N) in 2007, 77% of the influenza B cases occurred during the monsoon season (July to September); conversely, 70% of the influenza A cases occurred during the pre-monsoon period (April to June) [55] . This study also did not determine statistical significance, and has several limitations in the study design, including the retrospective collection of samples from children who displayed clinical symptoms.

In the same study, Murray et al. did not find any association between H5N1 infection and rainfall in Indonesia, though the authors attributed this result to variation in climate across the country, societal differences that may affect how poultry is handled, or differences in susceptibility of the inhabitants and/or poultry due to previous exposures [57] .",

Schulman and Kilbourne again made prescient early observations of the effect of airflow on the transmissibility of influenza viruses in the mouse model, demonstrating that the rate of transmission decreased with increasing ventilation of a closed chamber in which mice were housed [23]. A similar phenomenon was observed with rhinovirus; the probability of detecting airborne picornavirus RNA in office buildings was directly correlated with the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) content of the air, which is in turn inversely related to ventilation with fresh outside air [58] ; however, there were too few positive nasal samples to correlate CO 2 content with actual human infection.",

More than 300 residents of the Amoy Gardens high-rise apartment complex in Hong Kong were infected with the virus, in a dispersion pattern consistent with a single index patient, a visitor to the complex. The index patient was found to have extremely high viral loads in fecal and urine samples; computational fluid-dynamics modeling of the dispersion plume was most consistent with transit of virus aerosols through improperly sealed plumbing U-traps, up an airshaft in the index building, and then along prevailing winds into neighboring buildings up to 60 m away [61, 62] . In the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, 17 of the 30 infected patients were housed in different multibed wards from the index patient. A recent reanalysis of this outbreak found that, even though the patient wards were designed to be at positive pressure relative to the hospital corridor (thus preventing bioaerosols from entering the wards), small differences in temperatureas little as 0.5 8C -between corridor and wards was sufficient to allow two-way airflow at ward entrances, thus permitting SARS coronavirus entry into patient wards [63] .",

            "text": "Viral infections of the respiratory tract are common acute illnesses among humans, and virus transmission, by either direct or indirect routes, occurs in disparate regions around the globe. A more detailed understanding of how these viruses transmit can have broad public health implications. Indeed, a variety of meteorological factors have at times been associated with rates of virus infection as well as transmission among individuals. As presented in this review, precipitation, humidity, temperature, and airflow can be determinants of virus infection and transmission; however, despite robust investigation of the effects of these environmental factors, inconsistencies and uncertainties in the data remain. It is possible that meteorological determinants play greater roles in some geographic regions than others, or simply that differences in experimental design affect outcomes and data interpretation. Nonenvironmental effects, including but not limited to seasonal changes in behavior, family and social structures, and pre-existing immunity, could also be playing a role in respiratory virus transmissibility and rates of infection. Discrepancies in collected data suggest that more vigilant surveillance over large geographic regions and further controlled experiments in animal models and perhaps in humans will probably be necessary to determine with increased certainty the role that environmental factors play on the transmission of viral pathogens.

Lowen et al. expanded upon these experiments in the guinea pig transmission model. At 20 8C, transmission efficiency of an influenza A/ H3N2 isolate displayed a bimodal dependence on RH, with airborne (i.e. droplet or aerosol) transmission being maximal at 20-35% RH, poor at 50% RH, moderate at 65% RH, and absent at 80% RH. At 5 8C, transmission was overall more efficient than at 20 8C, and the relationship between RH and transmission efficiency was montonic, with efficiency decreasing with increasing RH [25 ]. Transmission was abolished at high temperature (30 8C), regardless of RH [26].",

In aerosol viability experiments, adenovirus [28,29] and rhinovirus [30] were more stable at high RH; by contrast, a bovine parainfluenza virus was more stable at low RH [31], while RSV demonstrated bimodal peak stability at 20% or 40-60% RH with relative instability at 30% [32]. Influenza viruses are also generally more stable at lower RH; some studies have observed a bimodal stability similar to that seen by Lowen et al., while others have not",

A reanalysis of the data of Lowen et al. showed that, although RH and temperature were both weakly correlated with influenza virus transmission efficiency, AH was strongly associated with transmission efficiency, with efficiency decreasing as vapor content of air increases [33]. Subsequent analyses of epidemiological and meteorological data in temperate areas in the United States [34] and Japan [35] suggest that low AH correlates strongly with the onset of influenza epidemic activity, more so than RH. However, as Tamerius et al. observe [20 ], hypotheses correlating AH and influenza epidemics are best suited to explain the seasonality of influenza virus transmission in temperate climates. While influenza virus transmission has been thought not to display marked seasonality in the tropics, accumulating data suggest that equatorial regions can experience not only year-round transmission (such as Colombia; 48N) [36] but also distinct annual epidemics that are unimodal (Fortaleza, Brazil; 38S) or bimodal Respiratory viruses and environmental factors Pica and Bouvier 91 Box 1 Modes of person-to-person transmission of respiratory viruses",
